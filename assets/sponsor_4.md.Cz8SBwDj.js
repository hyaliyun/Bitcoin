The facility consists of a dragstrip. The complex also includes a dirt oval. The drag strip hosts several drag racing events including the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA). The facility is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation and is located adjacent to Chicagoland Speedway. The 2019 winners of the Route 66 NHRA Nationals were Tommy Johnson Jr. (Funny Car), Steve Torrence (Top Fuel), Deric Kramer (Pro Stock) and Matt Smith (Pro Stock Motorcycle). Background The facility was built in 1998, funded by nine local entrepreneurs headed by Indy car owner Dale Coyne. The inaugural season saw 90 days of racing activity between the two tracks. In 1999, ISC partnered with the founders of the facility when it purchased of land adjacent to the facility to build Chicagoland Speedway. The quarter-mile, $20 million drag strip features a four-story, 38-suite complex. The 30,000-seat grandstand surrounds the start line and features 40 rows of fully backed seats. In 2010, the dragstrip was repaved. Past events on the half-mile dirt track have included the World of Outlaws sprint cars, late models, and monster truck shows. In recent years the oval has been used exclusively for Team Demolition Derbies, as well as TORC: The Off Road Championship. Also on the facility is a now-defunct , 15-turn road course, temporary off-road track inside the dirt oval, and a paved driving pad.

Its goal was the establishment of an Islamic state in Morocco. The group was active until 1985, due to a government crackdown.  Founding  Shabiba Islamya was founded in 1969 by Abdelkrim Motil and Kamal Ibrahim. Before leading the organization, Motil was an education ministry inspector and former militant against the French colonial regime, and Ibrahim a former teacher. The Sunni conservative movement attracted many teachers and students. It also established its own military branch.Lahlou , Aicha. ‚Äú1. Intermestic Strategies for Democratization in the Arab World and the Rise of the Islamist Threat: The Case of Morocco.‚Äù University of Houston, 2005. In 1972‚Äì1975, the Shabiba Islamiya experienced significant growth in Moroccan universities, filling the void left by the National Union of Moroccan Students when it was repressed. Part of the organisation's recruitment strategy was to run vacation camps where high school and university students could receive training in protest and propaganda techniques. It was officially recognized in November, 1972.  Beliefs  Shabiba Islamiya's declared aim was to oppose the influence of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organizations, which they viewed as detrimental to society. They also aimed to promote the Islamization of Morocco for it to become an Islamic State under Sharia law. It was a conservative Sunni movement. It was the first Islamist movement in Morocco to politically weaponise violence, though towards the end of the organization's duration, there was a significant divergence in opinion of the effectiveness of this strategy. The group was known for their opposition of leftist politics, with their primary targets were Moroccan leftists and secularists, including most famously the attacks on Omar Bendelloun and Abderrahim Meniaoui. The group was inspired by the ideas of Sayid Qutb of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. The group's leaders were particularly influenced by the concepts Qotb developed in his book Ma‚Äôalim fi al Tariq. The group's beliefs mirrored that of Qotb's beliefs about Egyptian society, as they considered Morocco to be in a state of pre-Islamic ignorance. Like Qotb, they also believed that violence was necessary in order to achieve a Moroccan Islamic State.  Assassinations of Omar Benjelloun and Abderrahim Meniaoui  Moroccan authorities have accused the organization of being involved in the murder of Omar Benjelloun, popular labor unionist and editor of Al Muharrir, the socialist party newspaper in Morocco and official of the Socialist Union for the Forces of Progress. Abdelkrim Motii, a leader of the Shabiba Islamiya, was fingered for the assassination that took place on December 18, 1975, and subsequently fled to Saudi Arabia. The Shabiba has also been blamed for an attack on Abderrahim Meniaoui, a member of the Party for Progressive Socialism. The subsequent investigation of this attack resulted in the disclosure of the armed branch of Shabiba Islamiya, run by law student Abdelaziz Naamani. When the involvement of Motii and Shabiba Islamiya in the murders had been revealed, authorities called for an intensifaction of arrest campaigns among its members. The investigation led to the arrest of Kamal Imbrahim on December 23, 1975. Sentenced to death in absentia, Motil fled to Saudi Arabia, and later Libya and Europe. He later settled in Belgium, where he continued to organize against the Moroccan government, publishing the small magazine Al-Mujahid (\\"The Holy Warrior\\"), which has garnered a small following among European Muslim immigrant communities. The assassinations and subsequent arrests signaled a shift in the organization, causing it to lose its momentum and later many of its followers until its ultimate disbandment.  Government Crackdown and Following Political Movements  Government suppression of Shabiba Islamiya began following the investigations and subsequent arrests of Shabiba members for their involvement in the assassinations of Benjalloun and Meniaoui in 1975. However, the group had been able to sustain itself for several years in spite of the arrests and exile of its leaders. The discovery of an arms cache near the Algerian border in 1985 resulted in the arrest, trial, and conviction of two dozens of militants, many of whom admitted to being members of Shabiba Islamya. Consequently, Moroccan authorities instituted a crackdown on the group which effectively led to its disbandment. Due to government suppression, many members of the movement fled to Iran, inspired by the Islamic Revolution, or to Afghanistan, to fight Soviet forces. By 1981, the movement lost much of its membership and structure, as many of its members questions the groups strategies and effectiveness. Several new political groups were founded by former Shabiba members, including Al-Islah wa‚Äôt-Tajdid (‚ÄúReform and Renewal‚Äù), later known as At-Tawhid wa‚Äôl-Islah (‚ÄúUnity and Reform‚Äù), in 1992. This group rejected their former organization's use of violence and instead looked to advance their political objectives within Morocco's existing political system. After the political party failed to obtain legla recognition from King Hassan II, they merged with the longstanding political party the Democratic Constitutional Movement in 1997. This merger enabled them to participate in later elections. This party has been founded by Abdelkrim Al Khatib and was later renamed to Justice and Development Party. It is now the main Moroccan Islamist party.

He played college football at Arnold College and was drafted in the nineteenth round of the 1951 NFL Draft. Robustelli was a six-time First-team All-pro selection and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. Early life Robustelli was born on December 6, 1925, in Stamford, Connecticut, to Lucien Robustelli, an Italian-American and his wife Catherine Robustelli. He attended Stamford High School, where he excelled in football and baseball. At age 18, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served on the USS William C. Cole in the Pacific Theater. After the war, he attended the now-defunct Arnold College, in Milford, Connecticut, where he played both football and baseball. After college, he was drafted in the NFL by the Los Angeles Rams in the nineteenth round of the 1951 NFL Draft. In June, 1951, he was offered a tryout with the New York Giants baseball club. The Giants offered Robustelli a $400 contract to play for their minor league affiliate, the Knoxville Smokies.Giants Among Men, Jack Cavanaugh, p.7, 2008, Random House, Football career =Player= A two-way end at Arnold College, Robustelli was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the nineteenth round of the 1951 NFL Draft and was considered a long shot to make the team. The Rams were impressed with his determination and toughness as a defensive end and he not only made the team, he was an All-Pro in 1953 and 1955. He played for the Rams until he was traded to the New York Giants in 1956. Robustelli spent nine seasons with the Giants, playing for six conference champions and one NFL championship team. He was a starter on the Giants defense from 1956 until his retirement after the 1964 season. In Robustelli's first season, the Giants won the NFL championship.

He played in 174 NFL games, missing only one in his career. Over his career, he recovered 22 fumbles (the NFL record when he retired) and intercepted two passes, returning both for touchdowns. Although small for a defensive end at 6'0\\" and 230 pounds, Robustelli was exceptionally smart, quick, and strong and known as a superb pass rusher.

The Giants never had a winning record during Robustelli's six years in the front office. Their best finish during that span was 6-10-0 in 1978, a season which included a 19-17 debacle to the Philadelphia Eagles on November 19 which ended with what is known to Giants fans as simply \\"The Fumble.\\" Robustelli announced his resignation as director of operations in conjunction with the Giants' dismissal of head coach John McVay on December 18, 1978, one day after the regular season finale.

Rancilio's earliest machine was 'La Regina' ‚Äì a vertical boiler machine, similar to the original Bezzera and Victoria Arduino devices in function and gilded 'Belle Epoque' styling. In 1950, Rancilio released a horizontal boiler machine, the Invicta Horizzontal, showing evidence of the postwar shift toward spare, modern styling. The machine however, still used the same forced-steam brewing method from the early 20th century. By 1953, Rancilio adopted lever piston technology introduced by Gaggia. In 1957, Rancilio released a model which automated the lever process, the H/L Automatica. The company followed new technological trends towards continuous deliver brewing introduced by Faema in 1961. In the 1965, Rancilio commissioned design work from industrial designer Marco Zanuso, beginning with the Rancilio Z8, and continuing with the Z9 in 1974. Rancilio continued with several Z-series machines, with the Z11 being the last. The S-series machine would become popular in the 1990s, and become well known in the North American marketplace. In 1997, Rancilio created a home kitchen sized espresso machine based on their commercial offerings. This was initially only available as a thank-you gift to importers and vendors of Rancilio's restaurant-grade coffee machines. This machine was later sold to consumers as the Silvia. The Silvia is a one group machine with a vibratory pump from ULKA and a single brass boiler that's controlled by 3 thermostats for both steam and hot water.

In 2011, they introduced a new advanced brewing system for the Classe 9 called Xcelsius, which gives precise control of water temperature during the brewing cycle. Rancilio made an attempt at a super-automatic machine, the Classe 12, and used cafes in Borders bookstores as a test market. It was deemed a failure, recalled, and abandoned. They subsequently purchased the Swiss Egro brand of super-automatic machines and have built a presence in that market with their Egro One. In October 2013 Rancilio was acquired by Ali group (an investment fund).

It can be reached by car from Abha within one hour. It locates in a velly 300 yards below the peak of the front mountain. It was originally inhabited by a tribal community known as the \\"flower men\\" because of their custom of wearing garlands of dried herbs and flowers in their hair. In the past, the village was only accessible by rope ladder, and in fact, the name Habala comes from the Arabic word for rope. They were supposedly fleeing the Turks at the time of the Ottoman Empire. In the 1990s, during a push to promote tourism in the region, a cable car was built to provide access to the traditional village with its stark mountain views. In consequence, however, the local \\"flower men\\" were dispossessed of their homes and forced to move into a modern village created for them in the valley below. When they refused to move, they were evacuated forcibly by the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Today, some of the original inhabitants are allowed back up to the village, but only to perform their traditional dances for tourists during the summer months. The village had already been evacuated, and no one was living there. Therefore, it was already empty in 1990 when the cable car was built. A more likely story is that because they were no longer suffering from persecution from the Ottomons, and life in the area was now safe, they had no reason to live in such as inaccessible place.

It is in the Anand district. Bhadran was nicknamed the \\"Paris of Gaekwad state\\" due to its prosperity and civil works carried out by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the visionary ruler of Baroda. Legend Years ago in Padampur, nearly two kilometres away (1.2 miles) from Bhadran town, there used to live two very strong brothers named Bhadrasur and Aghasur. The majority of the people here were very cruel. They defeated Devas with a power graced by Mahadevji. Agonized Devas prayed to the mighty goddess Uma and two Shakties named Bhadrakali and Ambaji, were created. Bhadrakali and Ambaji killed Bhdrasur and Aghasur respectively so Devas established temples of both Matajis. In due course Padampur was destroyed. In Samvat 1232 (1176 AC) on Sunday the sudi 11(before full moon) of month Vaishakh Bhadrapur, later known as Bhadrn and finally as the time passed, today's Bhadran, was officially formed. Patidar community are the main population. According to the data for the family tree of the Patels of the seven towns, published in 1925 CE, the first Patel, named Ananda, came from Anklav in Samvat 1415 (1359 AD) and lived here. Gradually his generations, as new Patels, used to live and settle with them. From the eleventh generation of four brothers, eldest and the second number named Revandas and Dhanjibhai, respectively, started to live in a section called Moti Khadki. Third and fourth numbers named Harkhjibhai and Manjibhai, in another section called Nani Khadki. Together with the above, now, Bhadran is flourishing with the influx of all different communities with new Patels from different places. Geography and climate Bhadran is located at 22¬∞ 21‚Ä≤ 33.48‚Ä≥ N, 72¬∞ 54‚Ä≤ 1.8‚Ä≥ E. The total area of Bhadran is around . The village is located on the fertile plains of Mahi river, north of mouth of Mahi river where it meets Gulf of Khambhat. There are three main seasons: Summer, Monsoon and Winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is dry. The weather is hot through the months of March to July ‚Äî the average summer maximum is , and the average minimum is . From November to February, the average maximum temperature is , the average minimum is 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F), and the climate is extremely dry. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill in January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid- September. The average rainfall is 93 cm (36.7 inches), but infrequent heavy torrential rains cause the river to flood. Recent history Before India's independence, due to advancements in all aspects, Bhadran was known as the Paris of Vadodara State, under the rule of Maharaja Sayajirao Gayakwad. In those days, there was a water supply system. Gayakwad Narrow Gauge Railway used to start from here to Vaso, the same huge Town Hall surrounded by beautiful garden now occupied by Gram Panchayat, on the bank of a huge pond. The town was fortunate to have a drainage system first, when most of the other towns had no dream that such a thing ever existed. People from all over the surrounding areas used to get treatment in the State-run hospital. This is now run by Bhadran Mitramandal (Mumbai Sanchalit) and has been transformed into a small but ideal hospital. It is in the process of expansion to offer all possible types of specialized services, within the capacity of available funds from the donors. For organizing this system, the real credit goes to late Dr. Jamanadas Patel. There is a veterinary hospital for animals too. Places for social activities include a Guest House, a Rest House, Nani Khadki Dharmshala, Brahman Vadi, Shree Bhadrakali Mataji's Vadi, and Central Hall in Town Hall and Shree Annkshetra. At different main centres in Bhadran, there are leadership memorials: statues of Shree Sayajirao Gayakwad, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallbhbhai Patel, Shivabhai Ashabhai Patel, Manubhai Mehta (diwan), and Shree Ratilal Patel, a martyr and victim of a shooting at Adas Station, as a secret agent distributing Freedom Movement leaflets. Lt. Shivabhai Ashabhai Patel was the follower of Mahatma Gandhi, and the main leader during the Freedom Fighters movement. After Independence (MLA), he used to serve as a president of Grampanchayat and Pragati Mandal. With him, there were two other pioneers of Pragati Mandal, Somabhai Chaturbhai Patel, and Dahyabhai Mathurbhai Patel. After Independence another freedom fighter, Ambubhai Haribhai Patel, settled in Nairobi, Kenya. There he spent his whole life supporting Jomo Kenyatta to achieve independence for Kenya, without any greed or grabbing for high status from the Prime Minister. P.C. Patel had offered two precious rooms near Model Cinema on Gandhi road, free of charge for Six Gam Patidar Mandal Office use from 1968 to 1971. Later, Lt. Madhubhai C Patel, a past secretary (1969) had offered a spacious underground room, free of charge for running this office for many years. Lt. Madhubhai was also a freedom fighter, a strict follower of Mahatma Gandhi and wore Khadi dress for his whole life. Brother of Shivabhai Ashabhai Patel, Hirabhai had donated for small-scale home industries for women and General Dispensary. Maganbhai Shankerbhai Patel had donated for the maternity home. Lallubhai shah built a beautiful tower in the centre of bazaar. From then until recent times, it has kept people aware of time. Hardly some were lucky to possess a timepiece then. Naranbhai Zaverbhai Patel of Laxmi Kooi, went to Africa in 1920, his son Hariharbhai born there in 1927, Naranbhai died two months before his birth. His mother Maniben return to Bhadran in 1928 and lived there till her death in 1995. Hariharbhai moved to Mumbai at age of 15, struggled throughout his life but gave good education to all his four children. On station road, Darwaji Bhagol, a triple arch structure, donated by Lt. used to please people passing through it. Recently, Sarvshree Lt. Ramanbhai Patel (Founder of Cadila, Ahmdavad) has donated a large, beautiful triple arch to change the facia (entry) of Bhadran. This leads with double-track road to Chamerda Bhagol. Sarvshree Ramanbhai, as past president (1975; 1981) and a trustee of Chh Gam Patidar Mandal, had played a key role in developing multidirectional progressive social activity reforms and bringing Mandal to latest status. Of course, he had received full cooperation from Ratibhai Rambhai Patel and Madhubhai Chottabhai Patel of Sojitra, Narenbhai Madhubhai Patel of Nadiad and Lt. Pramukhbhai Bhikhabhai Patel (very well known as a chief Engineer of Gujarat, and past president, 1993‚Äì1994) of Bhadran. In addition, Ramanbhai used to serve as a trustee of Charutar Vidya Mandal, Vallbh Vidyanagar. He has published a book, \\"Maha Gujarat Na Gauravshali Patidar\\". This familiarizes the youth of today about the great ancestors. Spiritual aspect For religion, there are temples of every faith such as; Bhdrakali, Mahakali, Ambaji Khodiar, Chamunda, Gayatri, Khaldevi, Ranchhodrayji, Nilkanth Mahadev, Baliadev, Purushottam Bhagvan, Harkhaba's Vaishnav Mandir, Ramji Mandir, Masjid, and Vadtal and Bochasanvasi Swaminarayan temples, for men and women separately. Over and above, there are ashrams of Shreemad Rajchndra, Shree Madhvanandji, Shree Muktanandji, Shree Kupanand Swami, Shree Shanti Ashram and Sthanakvasi Upashray. Here, people enjoy and celebrate every religious occasion. Bhadran is proud to be a holy town. Consider the Patel families had given fifteen St. Jewels. They are no more in this world.

Param Pujya Dada Bhagwan was nurtured in this city. He had a detailed study of many scriptures and was in search of the answers to questions such as: ‚ÄòWho is governing this universe?‚Äô ‚ÄòWho is the doer?‚Äô After spontaneous enlightenment, on the Surat railway station in June 1958, he obtained the answers to these questions and more. He was able to establish a link with Shree Simandhar Swami in Mahavideh Kshetra. In the outskirts of Bhadran, is located a Dada Bhagwan Trimandirhttp://www.trimandir.org/list-of-trimandirs/bhadran-trimandir/ made up of white marble, wherein reside Shree Simandhar Swami, Lord Shiva, Lord Krishna, many celestial deities along with Bhadrakali Maa.

The star cluster is young with an age of 20-30 million years. Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope showed a shell around the B3 III/IV-type star HD 68478. This could be a sign of recent mass loss in this star. A study using Gaia DR2 data showed that NGC 2547 formed about 30 million years ago together with a new discovered star cluster, called [BBJ2018] 6. The star cluster NGC 2547 has a similar age compared with Trumpler 10, NGC 2451B, Collinder 135 and Collinder 140. It was suggested that all these clusters formed in a single event of triggered star formation. NGC 2547 shows evidence for mass segregation down to 3 .  Cluster members with debris disks  Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope have shown that ‚â§1% of the stars in NGC 2547 have infrared excess in 8.0 Œºm and 30-45% of the B- to F-type stars have infrared excess at 24 Œºm. The system 2MASS J08090250-4858172, also called ID8 is located in NGC 2547 and showed substantial brightening of the debris disk at a wavelength of 3 to 5 micrometers, followed by a decay over a year. This was interpreted as a violent impact on a planetary body in this system. NGC 2547 contains nine M-dwarfs with 24 Œºm excess. These could be debris disks and the material could be orbiting close to the snow line of these stars, indicating that planet- formation is underway in these systems. Later it was suggested that these M-dwarfs might contain Peter Pan Disks. 2MASS 08093547-4913033, which is one of the M-dwarfs with a debris disk in NGC 2547 was observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. In this system the first detection of silicate was made from a debris disk around an M-type star.

Coaching career McNair retired from professional football in 1996 and began coaching at Camden High School in Camden, New Jersey. McNair was the running backs coach for the Cleveland Browns from 2001 to 2003, and joined USC Trojans from 2004 to 2009. In his first season, he served as Running Backs Coach, and took on the additional position of Special Teams Coordinator in 2005. McNair was considered one of the most effective recruiters in college football. He was named one of the nation's top-25 recruiters by Rivals.com.Jeremy Crabtree, Rivals.com Top-25 Recruiters, Rivals.com, February 12, 2007. McNair's contract at USC expired June 30, 2010 and was not renewed after 6 years.Gary Klein, USC parts ways with running backs coach Todd McNair, Los Angeles Times, July 1, 2010 He played a key part in the NCAA's investigation of the school's athletic department dealing with former Trojans running back Reggie Bush. The 2004 and 2005 USC Trojans football teams have had wins vacated and a BCS National Championship stripped following NCAA rulings that running back Reggie Bush was ineligible due to improper benefits. These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers,Jay Bilas, \\"Anyone know what NCAA's standards are?\\", ESPN.com, July 1, 2010.Bryant Gumbel, \\"Student/Athlete Behavior\\", Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, September 21, 2010.Bryan Fischer, \\" Trojans never stood a chance after taking NCAA's best shot\\", CBSSports.com, May 26, 2011.Pete Fiutak, \\"USC paying for NCAA's inconsistency?\\", FoxSports.com, May 26, 2011.Stewart Mandel, \\"What USC's sanctions mean for Ohio State\\", SportsIllustrated.com, April 27, 2011. including ESPN's Ted Miller, who wrote, \\"It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA's refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.\\" It bears mentioning that Miller wrote this, not in the context of a commentary on the NCAA's legitimacy, but in a lamentation on that season's PAC10 title game matchup. The NCAA ruled that McNair had engaged in unethical conduct,\\"NCAA appeals committee upholds sanctions against former USC running backs coach Todd McNair\\", Gary Klein, Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2011 claiming that McNair had known about some of Bush's improperly received benefits, and sanctioned him with a show-cause penalty, prohibiting his interactions with football recruits for one year. Following a failed appeal of his sanctions, McNair announced an intent to sue the NCAA, accusing the body of libel, slander and misconduct.\\"Former USC assistant Todd McNair sues NCAA over Reggie Bush case\\", Sports Illustrated, June 6, 2011 On January 20, 2013, it was reported that McNair would be the new running backs coach of the Arizona Cardinals. However, 12 days later, McNair stated that he would not be joining the Cardinals' coaching staff. On January 10, 2019, McNair agreed to terms to become the new running backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Lawsuit against the NCAA On June 6, 2011, McNair filed suit against the NCAA, alleging that the collegiate athletics governing body wrongfully caused him to lose his job with the Trojans because of punishment handed down in 2010 in the Reggie Bush case. The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks unspecified damages for libel, slander, breach of contract and four other alleged offenses. It also takes issue with the one-sided examination policy established by the NCAA, which doesn't allow those targeted by investigations to cross-examine witnesses used. The disputed issues in McNair's appeal centered on the believability of one of the NCAA's key witnesses in the case, Lloyd Lake, the would-be sports marketer who allegedly provided substantial amounts of money to Reggie Bush's family over a two-year period while the star running back played for the Trojans. McNair, the NCAA ruled last June, either knew or should have known about Bush's relationship with Lake and purposely misled investigators. But McNair said that he did not know about the relationship between Lake and Bush, and that the NCAA itself committed misconduct in the process of its investigation. In November 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Frederick Shaller ruled that the NCAA was \\"malicious\\" in its investigation of McNair. In his ruling, the Judge stated that e-mails between an investigative committee member, an NCAA worker, and a person who works in the agency's appeals division \\"tend to show ill will or hatred\\" toward McNair. In an e-mail, one staffer called McNair \\"a lying morally bankrupt criminal, in my view, and a hypocrite of the highest order.\\" Judge Shaller said he would unseal the entire inquiry into McNair in December.Editors (November 21, 2012) \\"USC investigation: Judge calls NCAA report on Todd McNair 'malicious'.\\" Sporting News.

The area was later developed for residential use, with unfortunate environmental consequences. It became a Superfund cleanup site in 1994. History =A city dump= This area in the Upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans was swampy low ground when it began to be used as a dump in 1909. The landfill became one of the area's main dumps for both residential and industrial waste. It often caught fire, with flames and smoke visible for a good distance away, and got the local nickname Dante's Inferno. The dump was first closed in 1952, but continued as a sanitary landfill site to the end of the decade. It reopened in the aftermath of Hurricane Betsy, and much debris from that storm was deposited on site. It was officially reclosed in 1966, although reports indicate that dumping continued for another year. The landfill site was then covered with ash from city incinerators and compacted by bulldozers. =Redevelopment= Starting in 1978, the old dump site was covered with sand and soil then redeveloped as a residential neighborhood, with 67 single-family homes, 225 townhouses (majority public housing), a 128-unit apartment complex, Moton Elementary School, and a small shopping plaza. Three residential developments - Press Park (the townhouses), Gordon Plaza (the single-family homes), and Liberty Terrace (the apartment building) - were built over the old landfill area. EPA excavation during cleanup of the landfill site. The redevelopment project was championed by then mayor Dutch Morial as an opportunity for low-income African-Americans to qualify for home ownership. Along with the City of New Orleans led by Morial, additional sponsors of the redevelopment project included former U.S. Representative William J. Jefferson, New Orleans City Councilman Johnny Jackson, the Housing Authority of New Orleans, the New Orleans school board, and HUD. =Problems= Complaints of trash working its way up to the surface and health problems by area residents first prompted Environmental Protection Agency investigations in 1986. The area was initially judged not worthy of federal remedy and no further remedial action was planned by the EPA. In 1991, the US Centers for Disease Control revised the national levels for lead in blood from 25 ugm/DL to 10 ugm/DL, prompting new concern for environmental lead exposure. Residents continued finding old trash just below the surface when trying to plant gardens or erect fences, and anecdotal evidence of health problems including abnormally high rates of cancer became common (though the ATSDR found, in September 1997, that statistically higher breast cancer rates in the area were not related to the site). People in the area petitioned for retesting in 1993, and the site was placed on the National Priorities List as a cleanup site the following year. Investigations showed that the actual amount of soil placed over the landfill before redevelopment was much thinner than had been claimed. =Remedial work= 250px EPA supervised cleanup included closing Moton Elementary, and on residential land removing two feet of soil, putting down a geotextile barrier, then topping it with two feet of new clean soil. In April 2001 it was announced to be 99% complete. Many area homeowners and residents have petitioned for being moved elsewhere, with the backing of Congressman Bill Jefferson, but they have not succeeded in getting funds provided. =After Hurricane Katrina= Flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina disrupted this area (see: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans), with storm surge funneled by the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal flooding into this neighborhood in 2005. There are concerns that the flooding has released additional toxins in the area. \\"Press Park\\", a 56 townhouse housing complex in the area, has been found contaminated with benzopyrene at levels some 50 times EPA health screening level, and remains fenced off as of April 2010. In March 2018, the Orleans Parish School Board was ordered by civil district judge Tiffany Chase to pay a $12 million dollar judgment to 1,433 former students of Moton Elementary School. This was the equivalent of $1,000 per year each student spent at the school, plus interest.

Despite looking much like an elliptical galaxy, it is peculiar for two reasons. First, it shows wispy edges and scattered dust clouds that are probably a result of gravitational interaction with its larger neighbors, similar to the galaxy M82. Second, this galaxy has an active nucleus. This caused Carl Seyfert in 1943 to include it in his list of galaxies, which are now called Seyfert Galaxies. However, NGC 3077, though an emission line galaxy, is today no longer classified as a Seyfert galaxy. NGC 3077 was discovered by William Herschel on November 8, 1801. He remarked that \\"On the nF (NE) side, there is a faint ray interrupting the roundness.\\" Admiral Smyth described it as \\"A bright-class round nebula; it is a lucid white, and lights up in the centre ... between these [stars,] the sky is intensely black, and shows the nebula as if floating in awful and illimitable space, at an inconceivable distance.\\" Distance measurements At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to NGC 3077. The surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to NGC 3077 using this technique is 13.2 ¬± 0.8 Mly (4.0 ¬± 0.2 Mpc). However, NGC 3077 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to NGC 3077 using this technique is 12.5 ¬± 1.2 Mly (3.82 ¬± 0.38 Mpc). Averaged together, these distance measurements give a distance estimate of 12.8 ¬± 0.7 Mly (3.9 ¬± 0.3 Mpc).

It was published on August 15, 2006, two years and eleven months after the previous book. This was the last Captain Underpants book to be published for 6 years, until Captain Underpants and the Terrifying Re-Turn of Tippy Tinkletrousers was published in 2012. Plot summary George Beard, Harold Hutchins, Sulu, and Crackers have now ended up in an alternate universe where the whole world is the opposite of their normal world (instead of being perched up in a tree in the Cretacious Period of the Mesozoic Era). Good is bad, smart is dumb, and heroes are villains. For example, Melvin Sneedly is struggling to comprehend a simple children's book and Mr. Krupp is nice and has a sense of humour (Like Captain Underpants does). After they realize these events taking place and then some, there they see evil versions of George and Harold (George and Harold's evil counterparts) and they learn through one of their evil twins' comics that they had turned their principal into an evil supervillain named Captain Blunderpants. Sulu and Crackers are kidnapped by Evil George and Evil Harold. They are hypnotized to be evil. (Crackers isn't hypnotized because she is female) Sulu becomes evil and attacks Good George and Good Harold but Crackers on the other hand, saves them (which Good George and Good Harold can't understand why). The heroes finally get back to their normal dimension of the multiverse, but end up unintentionally bringing Nice Mr. Krupp, Sulu, and Evil George and Evil Harold with them. Evil George and Evil Harold transform Nice Mr. Krupp into Captain Blunderpants by getting water on his head and the 4 began to wreak havoc into the town of Piqua. Good George and Good Harold take the 3D Hypno-Ring so that they could dehypnotize Sulu and take the Extra-Strength Super Power Juice just in case. However, Mr. Beard stops Good George and Good Harold from leaving the house and forces them to come inside as it is Grandparent's Day and Good George and Good Harold have to eat dinner with their grandparents at Good George's house. While Good George and Good Harold try to explain to Mr. Beard they need to leave, George and Harold's grandparents take the remainder of the Extra-Strength Super Power Juice and drink it. Elsewhere, Evil George and Evil Harold find Good George and Good Harold's treehouse, rummage through their personal belongings and find the \\"Goosy-Grow 4000\\". They then use it to transform Sulu into a giant monster named Hamsterzilla. Hamsterzilla charges at Good George and Good Harold, but Crackers flies in and Good George and Good Harold flee from their home flying over on Crackers' back, only to be chased by Evil Harold, Evil George and Captain Blunderpants. The Good George and Harold decide that they have to drink the super power juice to fight back, but unfortunately, they realize it is somehow empty despite there being a third amount of juice earlier. Since there was no more of the Super Power Juice left, Good George explains that there is only one plan left they can resort to now. The duo and Crackers manage to escape the evil duo that was following them. They go to Nasty Mr. Krupp's house (which Good George and Good Harold covered in toilet paper at an earlier point) and knock on his door. Right after Nasty Mr. Krupp answers, Good George and Good Harold quickly snap their fingers to turn Nasty Mr. Krupp into Captain Underpants. The latter then defeats Hamsterzilla. The evil trio notice this after robbing a bank, so Underpants now must fight his evil counterpart Blunderpants. However before the epic battle begins, Captain Blunderpants is transformed back into Nice Mr. Krupp by the snap of Good George's finger. The duo reveal that they didn't forget about reading their evil counterparts' comic book on how Blunderpants and Nice Mr. Krupp can switch identities. Underpants ties the alternate counterparts up, but when Good Harold states that nothing can go wrong, the worst thing is that something can go wrong. This causes a rain storm to turn Nice Mr. Krupp back into Captain Blunderpants and Captain Underpants is turned back into Nasty Mr. Krupp. Good George and Good Harold try snapping their fingers, but the snaps have no effect on either Nasty Mr. Krupp or Blunderpants as the rain is pouring too hard on them. Nasty Mr. Krupp can't figure out how he got outside, so he goes back to his soggy toilet paper-covered home to get back to bed not contributing to the plot of what is happening around him. With Captain Underpants out of commission, Good George and Good Harold are forced to get away on Crackers while Captain Blunderpants flies after them with Evil George and Evil Harold in his hand. Good George soon finds the Shrinky-Pig 2000 in the treehouse which the gang can use to make the evil twin counterparts no longer a threat. Unfortunately it is too late as Blunderpants grabs the duo by their Shirts while the device falls into the hands of Evil George and Evil Harold. When all seemed lost at a point before Blunderpants can finish off Good George and Good Harold due to Captain Underpants not being in commission to save them, someone's voice stops him from doing so. George and Harold's grandparents have arrived and order Blunderpants to put down their grandchildren, but Blunderpants just tightens his grip on the two children, so George and Harold's grandparents become Great Granny Girdle and Boxer Boy. They then place two curtains on them as capes before they defeat Captain Blunderpants and save their grandchildren. Good George notes he figured out what happened to the Super Power Juice that disappeared earlier. (Their grandparents drank it.) However, Evil George and Evil Harold are prepared to use the Shrinky-Pig 2000 on their alternate twins, but Good Harold claims they can go right ahead as they are holding the device backwards. The evil twins believe this and turn the device around before activating it, resulting in themselves being shrunk. After giving the evil twins the punishment they deserve and George and Harold's grandparents fly off for a romantic dinner, the duo dehypnotize and shrink Hamsterzilla back into Sulu. They then take Evil George, Evil Harold, and Captain Blunderpants back into the Purple Potty and then they kick them back to their universe. Good Harold states everything worked out perfectly, but this causes policemen to arrest them because they think they are the evil George and Harold, who robbed a bank while Captain Underpants was fighting Hamsterzilla. Good Harold again states that things cannot get any worse because they are going to jail for the rest of their lives. This time, however, Tippy Tinkletrousers (Professor Poopypants who changed his name at the end of Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants) comes and freezes the cops solid before he starts chasing Good George, Good Harold, Crackers and Sulu, and the book ends, once again, with Good George yelling \\"Oh no!\\" and Good Harold yelling \\"Here we go again!\\" =Comics= Comic 1: The Preposterous Plight of Captain Blunderpants (by evil Harold and George) The alternative boys hypnotize Mr. Krupp into becoming Captain Blunderpants to steal things for them. One day, he is chased by an angry cop for stealing pizza and accidentally eats a mixture of foods which give him superpowers. He flies to the evil twins with their pizza. From that point, Nice Mr. Krupp turns into Captain Blunderpants by getting his head wet and de-hypnotized by the snap of a finger. Comic 2: Adventures of Boxer Boy and Great Granny Girdle (by the real George and Harold) One day, a UFO lands on Earth and opens a store that trades improved Robo-Grandparents for real grandparents, which everyone but George and Harold does. One day, their grandparents find the others inside a \\"slaves room\\" in the store, along with superpower candies, which they end up eating and then they become Boxer Boy and Great Granny Girdle, who chase the bad guys into the UFO.

While its current incarnation is modern, the society has roots back to the first decade of operation of the University and was founded in the mid-1830s. The Washington Society operates under the constitution of the original Society and asserts its status as legitimate successor. The constitution, as it existed in 1929, required that the induction of new members be conducted by existing members. The refounding of the Society was made possible by Mr. R. E. Heischman of Charlottesville, an active member of the Washington Society from 1923 until 1925, who administered the oath of membership on the night of November 16. Events The Washington Society generally meets on Thursdays at 8pm when classes are in session at the University of Virginia in Hotel C of the University's West Range, known colloquially as \\"Jefferson Hall,\\" due to the fact that Hotel C is technically controlled by Jefferson Literary and Debating Society. Special meetings, such as the inaugural meeting every semester, may be held in other locations to accommodate for new member interest. Meetings generally consist of several literary presentations and a debate between two teams. Literary presentations and debates range from humorous discussions to serious readings or reenactments of plays, dramas, poems, stories, and the like. Membership in the Washington Society is open to any current student at the University of Virginia. By signing the roll of the Washington Society, a student declares their intent to join and becomes a provisional member for a semester. Provisional members are required to complete a literary presentation and debate in front of the Society as well as perform an act of service. When a provisional member fulfills the requirements for membership, they are inducted into the Society as regular members. The Society may also grant honorary memberships to community members who have provided exceptional service to the Society. The Washington Society also participates in three annual debates with the Jefferson Society. The Ethics Debate is held in the fall semester and addresses questions of ethical decision-making. The Harrison Cup is a humorous debate held in the fall semester. The Smith Simpson Debate on Foreign Policy is held between the two groups on a question of foreign policy in the spring and was endowed by R. Smith Simpson. The Smith Simpson Debate occurs in the Dome Room of the Rotunda. In addition to participating in inter-society debates, the Washington Society works to promote speech and debate more broadly. The Society hosts two literary competitions for University of Virginia students with a cash prize awarded to the winner. The Society used to sponsor an annual book drive and help coordinate a middle school debate club at Burley Middle School in Charlotteville. The Society used to jointly host a high school debate tournament alongside the American Parliamentary Debate Association organization at the University in February. History The Washington Society was founded sometime in the years from 1834 to 1836 from the merger of two earlier societies, the Academics and The Association for Mutual Improvement in the Art of Oratory.Patton: 237, 244-245. Like other student activities in the early years of the University, its interactions with the faculty were turbulent, at one point leading the Board of Visitors to forbid students from delivery of public speeches.Bruce, II: 359. In its early years, the society was active in University affairs with a literary focus, co- sponsoring from 1847 to 1851 (with the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, the Philomethean, and Aesculapian Societies) a literary magazine called the Jefferson Monument Magazine, whose purpose was both to raise funds for a memorial to the University's founder and to provide a literary outlet for the students. Following the collapse of the Jefferson Monument Magazine, the society co-sponsored the University Magazine with the Philomathean and Jefferson Societies, beginning in 1851.Bruce, III: 106-109. Like many student organizations at the University, the Washington Society was politically active in the secessionist cause in the years prior to the American Civil War. A resolution that had been in place since 1858 to avoid debate questions that \\"would bring up any of the political issues now distracting the country\\" was lifted in January 1860, and the society subsequently debated the questions of a state's right to secede (answering in the affirmative) and whether Virginia should secede from the union if Lincoln were elected president (also answering in the affirmative).Bruce, III: 260-262. In 1861, after the secession of Virginia from the Union, the Society voted to send its surplus treasury (about $200) to the Governor of the Commonwealth for the defense of the state.Bruce, III: 271-272. All student activities, including the Washington Society, were suspended from 1861 through 1865 for the duration of the Civil War, but the Washington Society was the first to reactivate, holding its first postbellum meeting on October 14, 1865.Bruce, IV: 75, 84. The Society cooperated with the Jefferson Society in raising money for the erection of a memorial to the University's Confederate casualties in the University Cemetery.Bruce, IV: 86. In 1913, the Washington Society joined forces again with the Jefferson Society to sponsor a \\"speaking league\\" for public and private high school students throughout the state.Bruce, V: 244. However, the activity of the society subsequently fell off until it completely died out during the 1920s. Briefly reforming in 1939 as a society with the aim of \\"encouraging intellectual curiosity, gentlemanliness, congeniality and the idealization of the Virginia gentleman,\\" it soon became extinct again until its modern refounding in 1979.Dabney, 148. In 1979, Three members of the Jefferson Society, J. Mitchell Aberman, Stephen L. Huntoon, and Josiah (Josh) Hensen, reestablished the Washington Society with the help of Richard Nichols Randolph, who was initiated into The Washington Society over the phone by R.E. Heischmen. Randolph then alters the constitution to allow members from the Jefferson Society to join; Randolph inducts the other three, who become the Second Refounders.washingtonsociety.org A year later, in 1980, Leslie Eliason, the first female president and fifth member, established or reestablished most of the traditions that continue today, including Thursday meetings in Jeff Hall, and debates with the Jefferson Society. Washington Hall The Washington Society was without permanent meeting facilities from 1842 to 1849, when they were granted a room in Hotel B, where they remained through much of the 19th century. In 1852, the Society asked for permission to enlarge its room in Hotel B; University historian Philip Alexander Bruce notes that this was the origin of the use of the name Washington Hall to describe these chambers.Bruce, III: 173-174. In 1869, the reorganized society expanded the hall to its current dimensions.Bruce, IV: 87. In the year 1896, following the burning of the Rotunda and the destruction of the Annex, law classes were held in Washington Hall.Bruce, IV: 290. The University took possession of the Hall sometime after 1929 when there was no Society to maintain the building. Washington Hall now houses the University of Virginia's Office of Equal Opportunity Programs. Notable members * John S.

The elaiosome is rich in lipids and proteins, and may be variously shaped. Many plants have elaiosomes that attract ants, which take the seed to their nest and feed the elaiosome to their larvae. After the larvae have consumed the elaiosome, the ants take the seed to their waste disposal area, which is rich in nutrients from the ant frass and dead bodies, where the seeds germinate. This type of seed dispersal is termed myrmecochory from the Greek \\"ant\\" (myrmex) and \\"circular dance\\" (khore√≠ƒÅ). This type of symbiotic relationship appears to be mutualistic, more specifically dispersive mutualism according to Ricklefs, R.E. (2001), as the plant benefits because its seeds are dispersed to favorable germination sites, and also because it is planted (carried underground) by the ants. Elaiosomes develop in various ways either from seed tissues (chalaza, funiculus, hilum, raphe-antiraphe) or from fruit tissues (exocarp, receptacle, flower tube, perigonium, style or spicule). The various origins and developmental pathways apparently all serve the same main function, i.e. attracting ants. Because elaiosomes are present in at least 11,000, but possibly up to 23,000 species of plants, elaiosomes are a dramatic example of convergent evolution in flowering plants.

R. Magney State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Minnesota, on the North Shore of Lake Superior. It was named for Clarence R. Magney, a former mayor of Duluth and justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, who was instrumental in getting 11 state parks and scenic waysides established along the North Shore. The park is best known for the Devil's Kettle, an unusual waterfall and rock formation in which half of the Brule River disappears into a pothole.  Geography  Judge C. R. Magney State Park is located on scenic Minnesota State Highway 61, from the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The last of the Brule River flow through the park, dropping and producing several waterfalls and cascades. A tributary of the Brule, Gauthier Creek, flows in from the west. Mons Creek, an intermittent stream on the park's northeast border, drains a small marsh. This stretch of the Brule River has three named waterfalls. from the lakeshore, Lower Falls drops over two steps just before the mouth of Gauthier Creek. A short distance upstream are Upper Falls, dropping , and Devil's Kettle Falls. From the Devil's Kettle to Upper Falls the river flows through a rocky gorge, as does the last of Gauthier Creek. Developed areas and trail access are confined to the lower third of the park. The northern section is rugged and difficult to access, with open ridges stepping away from the river valley. These extremes produce an elevation change of about in the park. The state park is entirely within Grand Portage State Forest, although most of the land directly adjacent to the park is privately owned inholdings. The park has a continental climate of extreme seasonal variation, moderated by Lake Superior, which keeps the shore areas 6 to 8 degrees warmer in winter and cooler in summer than the inland part of the region. Thus winters tend to be mild and snowy.  Natural history  = Geology = The park is underlain by alternating layers of basalt and rhyolite, which were erupted from the Midcontinent Rift System 1.1 billion years ago when the middle of the North American Plate began to crack. These layers bear intrusions of gabbro and diabase in the north and ferrodiorite in the south near the lakeshore. The rift itself formed a great basin, which gradually filled with sedimentary rock. The volcanic layers to either side became tilted; the basalt and rhyolite layers underneath the park dip about 12¬∞ and are estimated to be some thick altogether. From 2 million years ago to 10,000 years ago a series of glacial periods repeatedly covered the region with ice, scouring the bedrock and scooping out the accumulated rock in the great basin. As the glaciers began to melt at the end of the last glacial period, pockets of rock and dirt till were left behind while the basin filled with meltwater, forming glacial Lake Duluth. A layer of red sediment with clay minerals remains from this time on flat, inland areas of the park. The changing configuration of the receding glaciers, plus post-glacial rebound of the surrounding land, altered the depth and area of the glacial Great Lakes. The succession of lake levels left a series of beach ridges, wave-cut bluffs, and terraces at several elevations. These landforms are visible all along Minnesota's North Shore, but Judge C. R. Magney State Park is the only park bearing the complete series from the high water of Glacial Lake Duluth to the level of Glacial Lake Nipissing just above the current Superior shore. As the lake levels changed, so too did the rivers flowing into them. Several former stream beds and deltas can be identified at the southern end of the park. The campground sits on a delta, and a former stream bed lies directly opposite the park entrance.Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Judge C.R. Magney State Park interpretive signage. = Devil's Kettle = The Devil's Kettle The park is best known for \\"The Devil's Kettle\\", an unusual waterfall located on the Brule River from its mouth. The river splits in two to flow around a mass of rhyolite rock. The eastern flow goes over a two-step, waterfall and continues downstream. The western flow surges into a pothole, falling at least , from where it was popularly understood to \\"disappear underground.\\" Visitors have reportedly dropped sticks, ping pong balls, and GPS trackers into the Devil's Kettle without seeing them resurface downstream. There is even a legend that someone pushed a car into the fissure, but given that the Devil's Kettle is wholly inaccessible by road, most commentators dismiss this as hyperbole. These stories led to speculation that the channel had a separate outlet into Lake Superior, or more implausibly plunged deep underground or connected to another watershed entirely. For decades there was no satisfactory geological explanation for the Devil's Kettle, and it was a popular regional mystery. The underlying rock is not suitable for the formation of large underground passages, which are generally restricted to porous rock like limestone. Although lava tubes can form in certain igneous rock, they can't appear in rhyolite, and the underlying basalt is both too deep and not formed in the proper volcanic conditions for tubes. The area is not known to contain any faults, and even if it did it wouldn't be permeable enough to drain half the river. However, experiments conducted in late fall 2016 and announced by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in February 2017 strongly indicated that the disappearing water simply flows back into the Brule River shortly below the falls. At the suggestion of state hydrologist Jeff Green, two DNR experts measured the water flow above the falls and several hundred feet below them. The two readings were virtually identical, suggesting no water was being lost to some other outlet. They accounted for the failure of visitors' floating objects to reemerge by explaining that the powerful currents in the kettle's plunge pool would be enough to hold down most material until it was pulverized. Green and a colleague planned to conduct a dye tracing experiment in the fall of 2017 when water flows dropped again, with the hope of determining where the underground channel rejoins the main river. They were discouraged from doing so by park management and decided that the dye experiment was not scientifically necessary to confirm that the water simply rejoins the river below the falls. = Flora and fauna = With an elevation change of , Judge C. R. Magney State Park supports a wide variety of flora and fauna. Overall the park contains Laurentian Mixed Forest comprising both conifers and broadleafs. Before European settlement the Brule River Valley would have been forested mostly with white pine. Extensive logging and forest fires have altered the park's vegetation significantly, except around the rocky and inaccessible ridgetops. Today's secondary forest is dominated by aspen and birch, with stands of white spruce, sugar maple, and basswood. There are a few remnant stands of white pine on hilltops and ravines, especially along Gauthier Creek. Large northern white cedars are abundant along the river. Inland are many dense stands of white spruce, the result of planting and vigorous natural reseeding after the timber harvests. Around the waterfalls, the constant mist creates a microclimate conducive to several plant species not found elsewhere in the park. The large mammals found in the park, particularly in the remote northern section, are white-tailed deer, moose, black bears, red foxes, and timber wolves. Smaller mammals include groundhogs, red squirrels, eastern chipmunks, martens, and snowshoe hares. Broad-winged hawks, barred owls, and great horned owls are prevalent, while many other raptor species pass through the park during their migration. Several species of warblers nest in the park. The Brule River and its tributary Gauthier Creek have spawning runs of rainbow trout in spring and salmon in the fall. White-tailed deer are not endemic to northern Minnesota, having expanded into the region to take advantage of the plant regrowth during the logging period. In the 1940s and 1950s there were as many as 300 deer per square mile. The population has dropped as the forest has matured, but the deer still pose a management challenge as they overgraze young trees of certain species, over time altering the composition of the forest. The park has fenced deer exclosures around reseeded white pines.  Cultural history  The Ojibwe called the river Wiskode-zibi (Half-burned Wood River), which was translated directly into French as Bois Brul√© and shortened by English speakers to \\"Brule River\\". The name likely refers to an early forest fire, and fires played a significant role in the park's early history. A series of fires in northern Wisconsin in 1892 to 1894 forced lumber companies to abandon that area and cross Lake Superior to begin logging the North Shore even though the quality of the timber was lower. The Red Cliff Lumber Company was headquartered a few miles west of the Brule River, and much of the future park was logged at this time. However logging practices of the day foreshortened the harvest of North Shore timber too, as slash left on the ground for several dry years fueled a devastating fire in 1908. Droughts and fires bedeviled the North Shore for the next 30 years. In 1928 the General Logging Company began harvesting second-growth wood in the Brule and Cascade River valleys for a pulp mill in Grand Marais, but once again a devastating fire in 1931 burned and brought the industry to a halt. The slowly regenerating Brule Valley very nearly became an exclusive resort for the wealthy, as entrepreneurs from Duluth formed the Naniboujou Club and planned a luxurious lakeside complex with a 150-room lodge, cabins, bathhouses, tennis courts, a golf course, and a swimming pool, all powered by a hydroelectric dam on the Brule. With a membership of almost 600, the club purchased along the shoreline and planned to buy another inland. The Naniboujou Club Lodge was completed in July 1929, but then the Wall Street Crash of 1929 struck that October, triggering the Great Depression. The rest of the complex was never built, and the lodge went through a succession of owners and periods of closure. Instead of wealthy families, the next residents of the future park were homeless men. In 1934 the state bought from the Naniboujou Club and opened a \\"transient camp\\" on the Brule River to provide work and housing for men made homeless by the Depression. At first it was managed by the state's Division of Forestry and named the Grover Conzet Camp after their director, but at the end of 1936 it was transferred to the federal Works Progress Administration. The camp consisted of fourteen barracks, two recreation halls, two bathhouses, a dining hall, and a bakery, as well as three workshops, an office, a garage, a warehouse, and a root cellar. About 800 men rotated through the camp, conducting forestry projects such as planting trees and building fire roads. They also developed a small public park and built the trail and stairs leading to the Devil's Kettle. The enrollees also farmed some of their own food and battled a 1936 forest fire that burned north of Hovland. After the fire they built a sawmill and salvaged some of the downed wood. In return the men received wages, medical services, clothing, running water, and access to reading material and a radio. Despite these benefits a visiting timber union leader managed to foment a rebellion in February 1938 in which the administrators were briefly ejected from camp before state and local officials restored order. The WPA departed in July 1938 and the U.S. Indian Service converted the facility into a camp for Ojibwe youth. The concrete foundations of several camp buildings are still visible in the park's campground and picnic area. In 1957 the Minnesota Legislature established Brule River State Park and appropriated $5,000 to purchase privately owned land within the statutory boundaries. Clarence Magney, who had been instrumental in creating eleven state parks and waysides on the North Shore, died on May 14, 1962. The next year the park was renamed in his honor, and in 1965 Judge C. R. Magney State Park was expanded to by adding the section upstream from the Devil's Kettle. Development remained limited to a small campground, a picnic area, and the trail to the waterfalls. In 1987 a trail was added on the west bank of the river.  Recreation  The Brule River in Judge C. R. Magney State Park Amenities are confined to the southern third of Judge C. R. Magney State Park. The summer-only campground has 27 sites and a sanitation building with flush toilets and showers. The historic, privately owned Naniboujou Club Lodge provides hotel accommodations directly across from the park entrance. There are of hiking trails. The main hike is the strenuous walk to the Devil's Kettle and Upper and Lower Falls, which features nearly 200 stairs. This route is part of the Superior Hiking Trail, which swings through the park and dead- ended here until August 2003, when the northernmost were completed to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The Brule River is popular for its angling opportunities, as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has been stocking it with rainbow trout since 1930. The river also contains introduced brook trout, chinook salmon, and pink salmon during their respective spawning seasons. Anglers occasionally catch smallmouth bass and northern pike that entered the river from lakes upstream. The Brule River also provides whitewater kayaking for experienced paddlers, who begin upstream of the park boundary and must portage around several stretches.  Media appearances  The Devil's Kettle is featured the 1998 novel The Big Law by Chuck Logan. The 2009 movie Jennifer's Body depicts a highly fictionalized version of the falls and a wholly fictitious town named after them. Naniboujou Lodge and the Devil's Kettle Falls are also featured in the 2009 book Sew Far, So Good by Monica Ferris. In the two novels by acclaimed Minnesota author Peter Geye, The Lighthouse Road and Wintering, this feature appears as The Devil's Maw, and is an important part of the plot.

High school career Anno prepped at Saint Monica Catholic High School and then at Santa Monica High School in Southern California where he was recruited to play college football at USC. During his tenure at Santa Monica High, actors Charlie Sheen and Dean Cain, also alumni of Santa Monica High School, were teammates and good friends of Sam Anno. He was also teammates in high school with fellow Santa Monica High standout USC linebacker Keith Davis and Arizona State standout safety Darren Willis and free safety Junior Thurman who eventually (along with Anno) transferred to USC after playing football at West Los Angeles College. He starred as a player on the 1982 California Interscholastic Federation championship football team. College career Anno played linebacker during college in 1987 alongside Jack Del Rio; the two would be reunited years later in the NFL where Anno and Del Rio played for the Minnesota Vikings. Anno played for Ted Tollner, who ironically, was dismissed in 1986 from Southern Cal despite a winning record. Anno holds the All-time tackle record at USC for a single game with 23 tackles against Illinois in 1986. He also obtained his Masters Degree from USC in Athletic Administration. Professional career Anno played in the NFL between 1987 and 1994 as a linebacker, long snapper and special teams player for the Los Angeles Rams, the Minnesota Vikings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the San Diego Chargers. He spent three seasons as the Bucs' long snapper and special teams' captain. Anno was a very popular member of the Bucs with the fans. He went on to fulfill the same roles with San Diego after leaving the Bucs. He was the leading special teams tackler on all of his previous teams. Anno was voted team captain for three years during his career. The special teams tackle records he set still stand today with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 1989, players from the NFL voted him NFL Special Teams Player of the Year while he was at Tampa Bay. Anno was on the 1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers squad the year that former Santa Monica High School Vikings quarterback Pat O'Hara (1984) was drafted by the Bucs (10, 260). I was just in junior high school then and even though I didn't know him personally, I knew of him\\", said at O'Hara who grew up a mile from Sam Anno \\"Everyone knew who he was. Sam was a legend.\\" \\"It was really weird when I found out that they had drafted Pat\\", said Anno, who was about to enter his third season with the Buccaneers. \\"I said, \`No way . . . I can't believe that Pat is coming here.' \\" Anno and O'Hara renewed their friendship at Tampa Bay. O'Hara spent most of the season on the team's development squad and Anno led the Buccaneers in tackles on special teams. Coaching career Prior to coaching at University of San Diego, Anno coached at Central Connecticut, USC, Santa Monica High School, Venice High School and St. Monica High School between 1996 and 2007. Anno played a key role in comforting the USC football team and staff when he broke the news to the team of the death USC placekicker (whom Anno coached) Mario Danelo in 2007. His body was found at the bottom of a rocky cliff, and police investigated his death as an accident or possible suicide. The notion that Danelo could take his own life was so unbelievable to Anno that he went to the site near the Point Fermin Lighthouse from where Danelo apparently fell. Anno saw the slippery ice plants, the jutting rocks and the loose ground on the other side of the 4-foot concrete barrier where plenty of people went, despite the \\"Danger: Do Not Enter\\" signs. Anno told the story of the former Trojan walk-on's beginnings as a kicker during his San Pedro High School career as an All-City linebacker. Danelo had asked his father, former NFL kicker Joe Danelo, whose father kicked for the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills to teach him. \\"His father told Mario, 'I'll help you kick if you're up and have a bag of balls,'\\" Anno said. \\"And every morning at 3 a.m., Mario would be at the door with a bag of balls, and they'd go kick at the high school in the dark until 5 a.m.\\" In February 2015, Anno and Del Rio were reunited again when Del Rio, having been recently hired as head coach of the Raiders, hired Anno as a defensive assistant.

History During the 300 days of the Battle of Verdun (21 February 1916 ‚Äì 19 December 1916) approximately 230,000 men died out of a total of 700,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing). The battle became known in German as Die H√∂lle von Verdun (English: The Hell of Verdun), or in French as L'Enfer de Verdun, and was conducted on a battlefield covering less than .  Ossuary information  The ossuary is a memorial containing the remains of both French and German soldiers who died on the Verdun battlefield. Through small outside windows, the skeletal remains of at least 130,000 unidentified combatants of both nations can be seen filling up alcoves at the lower edge of the building. On the inside of the ossuary building, the ceiling and walls are partly covered by plaques bearing names of French soldiers who died during the Battle of Verdun. A few of the names are from fighting that took place in the area during World War II, as well as for veterans of the Indochina and Algerian Wars. The families of the soldiers that are recognized here by name contributed for those individual plaques. In front of the monument, and sloping downhill, lies the largest single French military cemetery of the First World War with 16,142 graves. It was inaugurated in 1923 by Verdun veteran Andr√© Maginot, who would later approve work on the Maginot Line. The ossuary was officially inaugurated on 7 August 1932 by French President Albert Lebrun. Architecture The cemetery outside of the ossuary The architects of the ossuary were L√©on Az√©ma, Max Edrei, and Jacques Hardy. George Desvalli√®res designed the stained glass windows. The tower is high and has a panoramic view of the battlefields. The tower contains a bronze death- bell, weighing over , called Bourdon de la Victoire, which is sounded at official ceremonies. It was offered by an American benefactor, Anne Thornburn Van Buren, in 1927. At the top of the tower is a rotating red and white \\"lantern of the dead\\", which shines on the battlefields at night. The cloister is long and contains 42 interior alcoves.

History The artifact is dated from the end of the 9th century, although it was probably made in the 4th century. There are only a few similar objects in the entire world. It is believed that the box was a gift for the ruler Rastislav of Moravia, brought during the times of Saints Cyril and Methodius (late 9th century) from the Byzantine Empire. The artifact depicts scenes of daily life, such as people farming on fields and breeding animals. It shows the legend of the founding of Rome. The artifact was found in pieces, some of which have never been found. Some copies of the box have been made; one of them was donated to Pope John Paul II in November 2003.

Ozaki served in the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet for 63 years (1890‚Äì1953). He is still revered in Japan as the \\"God of constitutional politics\\" and the \\"father of the Japanese Constitution\\". Biography Yukio Ozaki(left) and Mochizuki Keisuke(right) Ozaki was one of three children of Ozaki Yukimasa and his wife Sadako, who lived in the village of Matano, in the county of Tsukui, in Kanagawa Prefecture, in the Sagami hills, 35 miles west of Edo (present-day Tokyo). The three Ozaki children were born there--Yukio in 1858, Yukitaka in 1865 and Yukitake in 1866--just as Japan was opening itself up to the western world.Ozaki, Yukio, Collected Papers Of Yukio Ozaki, Vol. 8, \\"Memories from Foreign Tour\\", quoted in Sayanagi, Kazuo, \\"Life of Yukitaka Osaki\\", private paper issued at the Zygo Corporation, Middletown, Connecticut; Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, Hartford, Connecticut; Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 14, 79, xvi, 106. Ozaki began his career as a student at Keio Gijuku, before becoming chief editor of the Niigata Shimbun (Niigata Newspaper) at the age of 20. At 22 he returned to Tokyo and was given an appointment at the Bureau of Statistics. He was elected to the Tokyo Prefectural Assembly in 1885, before being expelled from Tokyo in 1887 for 3 years.Yukio Ozaki Foundation homepage, English Biography Yukio and his brother Yukitaka went to the United States in 1888 but Ozaki could not endure the temperature extremes and could not sleep in the heat of New York City and Washington, D.C. He sailed back to Japan via England and was then elected to his first term in the Japanese Imperial Diet. He would serve in that position for more than 62 years, becoming one of history's longest-serving parliamentarians.Ozaki Autobiography, pp. 118‚Äì119, 436 (The parliamentarian holding the record for the longest period of unbroken service is Charles Pelham Villiers, who was a Member of the British Parliament from 1835 to 1898, a total of 63 years and 6 days of continuous service; the MP who holds the record for overall time spent as an MP is Sir Winston Churchill, who was an MP for 63 years and 10 months of non-continuous service ‚Äì Forrester, Alison, House of Commons Information Office, Personal Email, August 19, 2004.) In 1890, Ozaki was elected to the First Parliament as a member of the House of Representatives from Mie Prefecture; and he was re-elected 25 times.Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. xiv. During these years, he was named to a number of cabinet posts. In 1898 he was Minister of Education 1898,Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 177‚Äì184. a position which he had to resign due to a speech which conservative elements in the Diet considered to have promoted republicanism; his resignation did not end the crisis, which culminated with the fall of PM ≈åkuma Shigenobu and a split in the ruling Kenseit≈ç Party. Later on, in 1914, he was Minister of Justice.Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 285‚Äì294. He is nicknamed \\"the god of constitutionalism\\" (kensei no kami) and \\"the father of parliamentary government\\".National Diet Library, Portraits of Modern Japanese Historical Figures He married teacher and folklore author Yei Theodora Ozaki, who was not related to him despite sharing the same surname as her maiden name. For many years, her letters were frequently delivered by mistake to him, and his to her. In 1904, after the death of his first wife, the two met and married.Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 245‚Äì246. Of the couple's three daughters Yukika Sohma was to become Japan's first female simultaneous English/Japanese translator.Kumiko Torika, [Voices of the Invisible Presence: Diplomatic Interpreters in Post-World War II Japan,] John Benjamins Publishing, 2009 p. 135. She claimed to represent her father's legacy because, she stated, she was only following in her father's footsteps as president of Japan's Association for Aid and Relief (AAR Japan), one of the network of co-laureate organizations honored with the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.Ozaki, Autobiography, p. 386; ...AAR President Yukika Sohma Ozaki was opposed to militarism and was sometimes confined by the authorities for expressing unpopular views. He could also applaud those whose beliefs differed from his own. For example, in 1921, would-be assassins rushed into his house while he hid in the garden with his daughter, Yukika. The father of one of these dangerous young men later approached Ozaki to apologize in person for the actions of his son. Ozaki immediately responded with a 32-syllable tanka poem, which he handed to the surprised man: :::If it was patriotism that drove the young man, :::My would- be assassin deserves honor for it.Ozaki, Autobiography, p. 342. He was especially active in the struggle for universal suffrage; universal male suffrage was established in 1925. During the 1930s, as an independent politician, he criticised the growing influence of the Japanese military and advocated the vote for women. He was imprisoned during both world wars. Hailed as a political hero after World War II, he was involved in anti-war, World Federalist and pro-democratic activities until his death. As the second elected Mayor of Tokyo after its administration was separated from the surrounding prefectures, he found himself in an arduous and sometimes disagreeable job--but his determination to make the city better produced noticeable results. Initial infrastructure projects that demanded his attention were wide-ranging: improving water supply and sewage, developing street surfacing, expanding streetcar service, and overseeing gas company mergers.Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 224‚Äì237. His mayoral position also provided a more ambiguous range of opportunities that included entertaining foreign dignitaries like US Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Britain's Field Marshal Lord Kitchener.Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 244‚Äì245. In 1910, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa visited Washington, D.C. leading a Japanese delegation that included Mayor Ozaki; this visit was linked to the Japanese gifting of cherry blossom trees to the U.S. Prince Tokugawa introduced Mayor Ozaki to many prominent members of the Japanese American community and to leading U.S government officials. In 1910, the City of Tokyo gifted 2,000 cherry blossom trees to the City of Washington, D.C., but due those trees being diseased and had to be destroyed, The City of Tokyo replaced them and presented 3020 cherry tree saplings to the City of Washington, D.C. in 1912.Constable, Pamela. \\"Nurturing a Legacy of Fleeting Blossoms and Enduring Bonds\\", Washington Post, April 8, 2007. p. A-1. Since that time, Washington's annual display of blooming cherry blossoms can be seen in West Potomac Park surrounding the Tidal Basin, a result of Ozaki's persistence in furthering this project during a time when he was mayor of Tokyo.Ozaki, pp. 231‚Äì233. These flowering trees were the genesis of the continuing National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C. and in other states as well.

It is also the capital of the M'Goun Conservation Area and home to a unique dialect of Tamazight. History Azilal was originally a meeting place for various Amazigh tribes to gather and trade. During the French protectorate in Morocco, the town was occupied by colonial forces and used as an outpost to spread further into the mountains. A colonial quarter remains inhabited to this day by local Amazigh families. The quarter is located on a hill within Azilal's municipal boundary and is separated from the town by a colonial-era wall. Geography Given the rich geology of the surrounding mountains, Azilal is the capital of the M'Goun Conservation Area and home to the M'Goun Geopark Museum. Azilal has become a jumping-off point for tourists to visit various World Heritage Sites. The Ouzoud Falls, one of the most popular sites in the conservation area, is only 27 km away by road. South of Azilal, there is a 304.8-meter high mast for longwave broadcasting. Demographics Azilal is inhabited by Moroccans of both Amazigh and Arab descent. While most Amazigh families come from surrounding villages, most Arab families have moved in from larger Moroccan cities. Azilal residents, therefore, often speak both Moroccan Arabic and Tamazight. The Azilal dialect of Tamazight is a mix between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas dialects. Landmarks =Thursday Souq= Every Thursday, residents of Azilal and surrounding villages gather at the southwest end of the city to buy and sell goods in an open-air souq. The souq is divided into sections based upon the goods being sold. A second share taxi stand is also set up just beyond the souq gate to streamline transportation from other towns. Rather than travel to the center of Azilal, passengers can go directly to the souq. =Dinosaur statue= A dinosaur statue was built in Azilal to commemorate the establishment of the M'Goun Conservation Area. This statue is a popular attraction for both Moroccan and international tourists who stop to take pictures with it. At night, the statue is lit up with multi-colored lights and surrounded by water fountains. Culture Along with Muslim and national holidays, Azilal residents also celebrate the Amazigh New Year according to the Berber calendar. A celebration of the holiday is often held in either a local cultural center or youth center and features reenactments of moments in Amazigh history and the singing of Amazigh pop and folk music. For the Amazigh New Year, many families in Azilal prepare couscous with seven vegetables. The traditional song and dance, ahaydus, is performed at most weddings and cultural events in Azilal. This call and response song has also been recorded by Amazigh pop artists and is occasionally played digitally rather than performed. Other cultural practices such as saint worship and tribal face tattooing have begun to decline. These practices are now seen as sacrilegious by many Moroccans including those in Azilal. While the practices themselves are disappearing, facial tattoos can still be seen on older Amazigh women and the remains of shrines for saints are still standing in and around Azilal.

After he became emperor in 361 following Emperor Mu's death, he created her empress. She did not bear any children, and she died in 365. A few months later, he would die as well, from complications of poisoning he suffered by taking pills given him by magicians in search of immortality. They were buried together with imperial honors.

It is a colorless liquid that is miscible with water and most common organic solvents. 2-Pyrrolidone itself and various derivatives made from it have a variety of industrial uses. Production 2-Pyrrolidone is produced industrially almost exclusively by treating aqueous gamma- butyrolactone with ammonia at a temperature of 250‚Äì290 ¬∞C and pressures ranging from 0.4‚Äì1.4 MPa over solid magnesium silicate catalysts. :Reaction of Œ≥-butyrolactone with ammonia to form 2-pyrrolidone (Œ≥-butyrolactam) and water in the presence of a solid magnesium silicate catalyst The reaction is carried out in a tubular reactor which is packed with the solid catalyst. The latter is arranged as a fixed bed and the reaction is carried out in the vapor phase. Product yields of 75‚Äì85% are reached. After subsequent distillation and purification, the desired 2-pyrrolidone is obtained with a purity of 99.5%. Alternative routes include the catalytic or electrochemical reduction of succinimide, the carbonylation of allylamine, the hydrogenation of succinonitrile under hydrolytic conditions and the reaction of maleic or succinic anhydride in aqueous ammonia with Pd‚ÄìRu-catalysts. In 2010, the worldwide demand for 2-pyrrolidone was estimated to be 32.000 t. Important manufacturers of 2-pyrrolidone are BASF and ISP (International Speciality Products, now Ashland Inc.). Uses 2-Pyrrolidone itself is used in inkjet cartridges. A variety of pharmaceutical drugs are 2-pyrrolidone derivatives, including cotinine, doxapram, povidone, and ethosuximide, and the racetams. The chemical is an intermediate in the production of the polyvinylpyrrolidone precursor vinylpyrrolidone and the solvent N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). Safety 2-Pyrrolidone is an eye irritant.

In general inhaled insulins have been more rapidly absorbed than subcutaneous injected insulin, with faster peak concentration in serum and more rapid metabolism. Exubera, developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics), became the first inhaled insulin product to be marketed, in 2006 by Pfizer, but poor sales led Pfizer to withdraw it in 2007. Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind, was approved by the FDA in 2014. Dypreza, an inhaled insulin developed by Highlands Pharmaceuticals, was approved for sale in Europe in 2013 and in the United States in 2016. However, cases of chronic lung disease led the European Medicines Agency to recall the drug in 2018. A fraud suit against Highlands is ongoing.  History  Insulin was introduced by Banting and Best from the University of Toronto in 1921 as an injectable agent. German researchers first introduced the idea of inhalable insulin in 1924. Years of failure followed until scientists realized they might be able to use new technologies to turn insulin into a concentrated powder with particles sized for inhalation. In the 1980s Nektar Therapeutics developed technology to make insulin into small particles, technology then licensed to Pfizer. Alkermes developed a delivery device that they licensed to Eli Lilly and Company. Once concrete methods were developed, human tests began in the late 1990s. In January 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Exubera, a form of inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer. It was approved in the UK in August 2006 but reimbursed by the National Health Service only for people who had problems with needles. It was not reimbursed by any US insurer. A 2007 systematic review concluded that the inhaled hexameric insulin (Exubera) \\"appears to be as effective, but no better than injected short- acting insulin. The additional cost is so much more that it is unlikely to be cost-effective.\\" In 2007, Pfizer announced that it would no longer manufacture or market Exubera. According to Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Kindler this was because Exubera \\"failed to gain acceptance among patients and physicians\\". At the time of Exubera's discontinuation, several other companies were pursuing inhaled insulin including Alkermes working with Eli Lilly and Company, MannKind Corporation, and Aradigm working with Novo Nordisk. By March 2008, except for MannKind's Afrezza product, all of these products had been discontinued because investors all decided to withdraw funding. On March 16, 2009 MannKind submitted a new drug application for their inhalable insulin. In 2011 the FDA denied approval of Afrezza; because the design of the delivery device had changed, it requested additional clinical trials to ensure that people would use it the same way as the earlier versions. After conducting further studies, Mannkind submitted a new application, and in June, 2014, the FDA approved Afrezza for both Type I and Type II adult diabetics, with a label restriction for patients having asthma, active lung cancer or COPD. In 2014 Mannkind and Sanofi agreed that Sanofi would take over manufacturing and marketing of Afrezza, but Sanofi said it was dropping the effort in January 2016 due to poor sales of $7.5 million in 2015; the companies formally terminated the agreement in November 2016. At the time that Sanofi announced it was dropping the product Mannkind said it would continue alone, and it had taken over manufacturing and relaunched the drug by July 2016. According to results presented at the 2018 meeting of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), Afrezza increases the time that blood glucose levels remain in optimal range (70 ‚Äì 180 mg/dl), reducing both spikes in blood glucose and time in hypoglycemia in adults with Type I diabetes, compared to insulin Aspart.

He played four One Day Internationals (ODIs) for the Australia national cricket team in 2006, picking up two wickets. He played domestic first-class and one-day cricket for Western Australia from the 2004/05 to 2010/11 seasons. Life and career Dorey was born in East Fremantle, Western Australia. He started his cricketing career playing for the Western Australian Under-17 and Under-19 sides during the late 1990s, before he travelled around Europe for two and half years. He suffered a terrible accident while snowboarding in Austria: after knocking himself out, Dorey was trying to navigate back to his base when he was cut off by a German whose skis sliced open his right knee. The wound required 14 stitches, and Dorey was worried his sporting career may be over. During his time in Europe, he also served as a bodyguard for the children of a wealthy Russian businessman. Until his knee injury, Dorey had been planning to attempt to break into professional football on his return to Australia, having previously played for South Fremantle. Instead, he began playing professional cricket. A string of injuries led to his call-up to the Western Australia state side during the 2004‚Äì05 season, and he made his debut in the ING Cup against Victoria in November. Later in the same month, he made his first-class debut, claiming one wicket during a draw against Queensland. He claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in his third first-class match, finishing with 5/41 against the touring Pakistanis. Dorey completed the 2004‚Äì05 season with 23 first-class wickets, and 4 one-day wickets. The 2005‚Äì06 season saw Dorey improve on his figures from the previous season. During a Pura Cup match against the Queensland Bulls, he claimed seven wickets in an innings, finishing with 7/86, his best return in first-class cricket. His performances saw him selected as part of the Australian squad for the 2005‚Äì06 VB Series, with chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns saying \\"Brett is an exciting prospect who has good height and is able to generate good bounce. He has had solid results in domestic cricket and we want to have a look at him at the next level.\\" Dorey claimed his first international wicket on debut against South Africa, having Shaun Pollock caught off his bowling to return 1/51. Dorey failed to claim wickets in either of his two other matches in the series, and was released from the Australian squad to return to Western Australia for their match against the New South Wales Blues.

Executed in the Mannerist style (1520‚Äì1600) of the late Renaissance, the large-format (6.77m √ó 9.94m) oil painting comprehends the stylistic ideal of compositional harmony, as practised by the artists Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo.Penguin Dictionary of Art and Artists (1997) Seventh Edition, Peter Murray, Linda Murray, Eds. p. 318. The art of the High Renaissance (1490‚Äì1527) emphasized human figures of ideal proportions, balanced composition, and beauty, whereas Mannerism exaggerated the Renaissance ideals ‚Äî of figure, light, and colour ‚Äî with asymmetric and unnaturally elegant arrangements achieved by flattening the pictorial space and distorting the human figure as an ideal preconception of the subject, rather than as a realistic representation.Penguin Dictionary of Art and Artists (1997) Seventh Edition, Peter Murray and Linda Murray, Eds. p. 469. The visual tension among the elements of the picture and the thematic instability among the human figures in The Wedding Feast at Cana derive from Veronese's application of technical artifice, the inclusion of sophisticated cultural codes and symbolism (social, religious, theologic), which present a biblical story relevant to the Renaissance viewer and to the contemporary viewer. The pictorial area (67.29 m2) of the canvas makes The Wedding Feast at Cana the most expansive picture in the paintings collection of the Mus√©e du Louvre. History =The commission= In 1562, the Benedictine monks commissioned Paolo Veronese to realise The Wedding Feast at Cana as a monumental painting (6.77m √ó 9.94m) to occupy the back wall of the monastery's refectory, at the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. At Venice, on 6 June 1562, the Black Monks of the Order of Saint Benedict (OSB) commissioned Paolo Veronese to realise a monumental painting (6.77 m √ó 9.94 m) to decorate the far wall of the monastery's new refectory, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio, at the Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, on the eponymous island. In their business contract for the commission of The Wedding Feast at Cana, the Benedictine monks stipulated that Veronese be paid 324 ducats; be paid the costs of his personal and domestic maintenance; be provided a barrel of wine; and be fed in the refectory. Aesthetically, the Benedictine contract stipulated that the painter represent ‚Äúthe history of the banquet of Christ‚Äôs miracle at Cana, in Galilee, creating the number of [human] figures that can be fully accommodated‚Äù, and that he use optimi colori (optimal colours) ‚Äî specifically, the colour ultramarine, a deep-blue pigment made from lapis lazuli, a semi-precious, metamorphic rock.Cicogna, Emmanuelle Antonio, Delle Inscrizioni Veneziane (1824), Vol. IV, p. 234. Assisted by his brother, Benedetto Caliari, Veronese delivered the completed painting in September 1563, in time for the Festa della Madonna della Salute, in November. =Composition and technique= In the 17th century, during the mid‚Äì1630s, supporters of Andrea Sacchi (1599‚Äì1661) and supporters of Pietro da Cortona (1596‚Äì1669) argued much about the ideal number of human figures for a representational composition.Wittkower, Rudolf. The Art and Architecture of Italy: 1600‚Äì1750 (1993) pp. 261‚Äì266. Sacchi said that only a few figures (fewer than twelve) permit the artist to honestly depict the unique body poses and facial expressions that communicate character; while da Cortona said that many human figures consolidate the general image of a painting into an epic subject from which sub-themes would develop. In the 18th century, in Seven Discourses on Art (1769‚Äì90), the portraitist Joshua Reynolds (1723‚Äì92), said that: > The subjects of the Venetian painters are mostly such as gave them an > opportunity of introducing a great number of figures, such as feasts, > marriages, and processions, public martyrdoms, or miracles. I can easily > conceive that [Paolo] Veronese, if he were asked, would say that no subject > was proper for an historical picture, but such as admitted at least forty > figures; for in a less number, he would assert, there could be no > opportunity of the painter's showing his art in composition, his dexterity > of managing and disposing the masses of light, and groups of figures, and of > introducing a variety of Eastern dresses and characters in their rich > stuffs.Reynolds, Joshua. Seven Discourses on Art (1769‚Äì90), pp. 31‚Äì32. As a narrative painting in the Mannerist style, The Wedding Feast at Cana combines stylistic and pictorial elements from the Venetian school's philosophy of colorito (priority of colour) of Titian (1488‚Äì1576) to the compositional disegno (drawing) of the High Renaissance (1490‚Äì1527) used in the works of Leonardo (1452‚Äì1519), Raphael (1483‚Äì1520), and Michelangelo (1475‚Äì1564).The Wedding Feast at Cana (1562‚Äì3), Paolo Veronese: Analysis. Art Encyclopedia. p. 2. http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/wedding- feast-at-cana.htm As such, Veronese's depiction of the crowded banquet-scene that is The Wedding Feast at Cana is meant to be viewed upwards, from below ‚Äî because the painting's bottom-edge was 2.50 metres from the refectory floor, behind and above the head-table seat of the abbot of the monastery.Hanson, Kate. \\"The Language of the Banquet: Reconsidering Paolo Veronese's The Wedding at Cana\\" (2010) InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal of Visual Culture, Issue 14: Aesthetes and Eaters ‚Äî Food and the Arts (Winter 2010), p. 5. As stipulated in the Benedictine contract for the painting, the canvas of monumental dimensions (6.77m x 9.94m) and area (67.29m2) was to occupy the entire display-wall in the refectory. In the 16th century, Palladio's great- scale design was Classically austere; the monastery dining-room featured a vestibule with a large door, and then stairs that led to a narrow ante- chamber, where the entry door to the refectory was flanked with two marble lavabos, for diners to cleanse themselves;Lauritzen, Peter. \\"The Architectural History of San Giorgio\\", in Apollo (1976), p.8. the interior of the refectory featured barrel vaults and groin vaults, rectangular windows, and a cornice.Lauritzen, p. 8. In practise, Veronese's artistic prowess with perspective and architecture (actual and virtual) persuaded the viewer to see The Wedding Feast at Cana as a spatial extension of the refectory.Lauritzen, p.9. =The subject= In The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563), Paolo Veronese depicts the New Testament story of the Marriage at Cana within the historical context of the Renaissance in the 16th century. In the Gospel of John, the story of the first Christian miracle, Mary, her son, Jesus of Nazareth, and some of his Apostles, attend a wedding in Cana, a city in Galilee. In the course of the wedding banquet, the supply of wine was depleted; at Mary's request, Jesus commanded the house servants to fill stone jugs with water, which he then transformed into wine (John 2:1‚Äì11). =The banquet= The Wedding Feast at Cana represents the water-into-wine miracle of Jesus in the grand style of the sumptuous feasts of food and music that were characteristic of 16th-century Venetian society; the sacred in and among the profane world where ‚Äúbanquet dishes not only signify wealth, power, and sophistication, but transfer those properties directly into the individual diner. An exquisite dish makes the diner exquisite.‚ÄùAlbala, Kenneth. Eating Right in the Renaissance (2002), p. 184. The musicians providing ambience for The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563) are personified by Veronese (viola da braccio), and the principal painters of the Venetian school: Jacopo Bassano (cornetto), Tintoretto (viola da braccio) and Titian (violone); standing beside Titian is the poet Pietro Aretino.Priever, Andrea. Paolo Caliari, called Veronese: 1528‚Äì1588 (2000) Paul Aston and Fiona Hulse, p. 81. (detail, lower centre- plane) The banquet scene is framed with Greek and Roman architecture from Classical Antiquity and from the Renaissance, Veronese's contemporary era. The Gr√¶co‚ÄìRoman architecture features Doric order and Corinthian order columns surrounding a courtyard that is enclosed with a low balustrade; in the distance, beyond the courtyard, there is an arcaded tower, by the architect Andrea Palladio. In the foreground, musicians play stringed instruments of the Late‚ÄìRenaissance, such as the lute, the violone, and the viola da gamba. Among the wedding guests are historical personages, such as the monarchs Eleanor of Austria, Francis I of France, and Mary I of England, Suleiman the Magnificent, tenth sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; the poetess Vittoria Colonna, the diplomat Marcantonio Barbaro, and the architect Daniele Barbaro; the noblewoman Giulia Gonzaga and Cardinal Pole, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, the master jester Triboulet and the Ottoman statesman Sokollu Mehmet Pa≈üa ‚Äî all dressed in the sumptuous Occidental and Oriental fashions alla Turca popular in the Renaissance.The Wedding Feast at Cana (1562‚Äì3), Paolo Veronese: Analysis. Art Encyclopedia. p. 3. http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/wedding-feast-at-cana.htm According to 18th-century legend and artistic tradition, the painter of the picture (Paolo Veronese) included himself to the banquet scene, as the musician in white tunic, who is playing a viola da braccio. Accompanying Veronese are the principal painters of the Venetian school: Jacopo Bassano, playing the cornetto, Tintoretto, also playing a viola da braccio, and Titian, dressed in red, playing the violone; besides them stands the poet Pietro Aretino considering a glass of the new red wine. A more recent study links the identity of the performer seated behind Veronese playing viola da gamba with Diego Ortiz, musical theorist and then chapell master at the court of Naples. =Symbolism= In The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563) Veronese shows the sated guests at the nuptial banquet-table awaiting the dessert-course wine service. The guests awaiting the new, red wine include Suleiman the Magnificent, an elegant woman discreetly cleaning her teeth with a toothpick, and a woman urging her husband to ask the bride about the new red wine they have been served. (detail, left lower-quarter) The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563) is a painting of the Early Modern period; the religious and theological narrative of Veronese's interpretation of the water-into-wine miracle is in two parts. I. On the horizontal axis ‚Äî the lower-half of the painting contains 130 human figures; the upper-half of the painting is dominated by a cloudy sky and Ge√¶co‚ÄìRoman architecture, which frames and contains the historical figures and Late-Renaissance personages invited to celebrate the bride and bridegroom at their wedding feast. Some human figures are rendered in foreshortened perspective, the stylisation of Mannerism; the old architecture mirrors the contemporary architecture of Andrea Palladio; the narrative treatment places the religious subject in a cosmopolitan tableau of historical and contemporary personages, most of whom are fashionably dressed in costumes from the Orient ‚Äî Asia as known to Renaissance society in the 16th century. Seated behind and above the musicians are the Virgin Mary, Jesus of Nazareth, and some of his Apostles. Above the figure of Jesus, on an elevated walkway, a man watches the banquet, and a serving maid awaits for the carver to carve an animal to portions. To the right, a porter arrives with more meat for the feasting diners to eat. The alignment of the Jesus figure under the carver's blade and block, and the butchered animals, prefigure his sacrifice as the Lamb of God. bottom-right-quarter ‚Äî a barefoot wine-servant pours the new, red wine into a serving ewer, from a large, ornate oenochoe, which earlier had been filled with water. Behind the wine servant stands the poet Pietro Aretino, intently considering the red wine in his glass. bottom-left-quarter ‚Äî the steward of the house (dressed in green) supervises the black servant-boy proffering a glass of the new, red wine to the bridegroom, the host of the wedding feast; at the edge of the nuptial table, a dwarf holds a bright-green parrot, and awaits instructions from the house steward. II. On the vertical axis ‚Äî the contrasts of light and shadow symbolize the co-existence of mortality and vanitas, the transitory pleasures of earthly life; the protocol of religious symbolism supersedes the social protocol. In the wedding banquet proper, the holy guests and the mortal hosts have exchanged their social status, and so Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and some of his Apostles, are seated in the place of honour of the centre-span of the banquet table, whilst the bride and bridegroom sit, as guests, at the far end of the table's right wing. Above the Jesus figure, a carver is carving a lamb, beneath the Jesus figure, musicians play lively music, yet, before them is an hourglass ‚Äî a reference to the futility of human vanity.The Wedding Feast at Cana, Paolo Veronese: Analysis. Art Encyclopedia. p. 3. http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous- paintings/wedding-feast-at-cana.htm Moreover, despite the kitchen's continuing preparation of roasted meat, the main course of a celebratory meal, the wedding guests are eating the dessert course, which includes fruit and nuts, wine and sweet quince cheese (symbolically edible marriage); that contradiction, between kitchen and diners, indicates that the animals are symbolic and not for eating. Plunder and re-installation Self-portrait of a Renaissance artist, by Paolo Veronese (1528‚Äì88) From the 16th to the 18th centuries, for 235 years, the painting decorated the refectory of the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, until 11 September 1797, when soldiers of Napoleon's French Revolutionary Army plundered the picture as war booty, during the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792‚Äì1802). To readily transport the oversized painting ‚Äî from a Venetian church to a Parisian museum ‚Äî the French soldiers horizontally cut the canvas of The Wedding Feast at Cana, and rolled it like a carpet, to be re-assembled and re-stitched in France. In 1798, along with other plundered works of art, the 235-year-old painting was stored in the first floor of the Louvre Museum; five years later, in 1803, that store of looted art had become the Mus√©e Napol√©on ‚Äî the personal art collection of the future Emperor of the French. In the early 19th century, after the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì15), the repatriation and restitution of looted works of art was integral to the post‚ÄìNapoleonic conciliation treaties. Appointed by Pope Pius VII, the Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova negotiated the French repatriation of Italian works of art that Napoleon had plundered from the Papal States with the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) ‚Äî yet, the prejudiced curator of the Mus√©e Napol√©on, Vivant Denon, falsely claimed that Veronese's canvas was too fragile to travel from Paris to Venice, and Canova excluded The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563) from repatriation to Italy, and, in its stead, sent to Venice the Feast at the House of Simon (1653), by Charles Le Brun. In the late 19th century, during the Franco‚ÄìPrussian War (1870‚Äì71), The Wedding Feast at Cana, then 308 years old, was stored in a box at Brest, in Brittany. In the 20th century, during the Second World War (1939‚Äì45), the 382-year-old painting was rolled up for storage, and continually transported to hiding places throughout the south of France, lest Veronese's art become part of the Nazi plunder stolen during the twelve-year existence (1933‚Äì45) of the Third Reich. In the early 21st century, on 11 September 2007 ‚Äî the 210th anniversary of the Napoleonic looting in 1797 ‚Äî a computer-generated, digital facsimile of The Wedding Feast at Cana was hung in the Palladian refectory of the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. The full-sized (6.77m x 9.94m) digital facsimile is composed of 1,591 graphic files, and was made by Factum Arte, Madrid, on commission from the Giorgio Cini Foundation, Venice, and the Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris.See Returning \\"Les Noces de Cana\\" Restoration Until the 20th century, when the Louvre Museum restored The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563), the steward of the house wore a red tabard coat; upon removal of the rouge marron red-hue, the colour of the tabard was green. (lower-left-quarter) In 1989, the Louvre Museum began a painting restoration of The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563), which provoked an art-world controversy like that caused by the eleven-year Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes (1989‚Äì99). Organised as the Association to Protect the Integrity of Artistic Heritage (APIAH), artists protested against the restoration of the 426-year-old painting, and publicly demanded to be included to the matter, which demand the Louvre Museum denied.Simons, Marlise, ‚ÄúRepaired Masterpiece Redisplayed‚Äù, The New York Times, 17 December 1992, p. 00. To the APIAH, especially controversial was the Museum's removal of a rouge marron red hue over-painting of the tabard coat of the house steward, who is standing (left-of-centre) in the foreground supervising the black, servant-boy handing a glass of the new, red wine to the bridegroom. The removal of the red hue revealed the original, green colour of the tabard. In opposing that aspect of the painting's restoration, the APIAH said that Veronese, himself, had changed the tabard's colour to rouge marron instead of the green colour of the initial version of the painting.Gamboni, Dario. Returning ‚ÄúLes noces de Cana‚Äù, by Paolo Caliari, and Some Issues Concerning Repatriation and Originality, Factum Arte, January 2008, p. 4. In June 1992, three years into the restoration of the painting, The Wedding Feast at Cana twice suffered accidental damages. In the first accident, the canvas was spattered with rainwater that leaked into the museum through an air vent. In the second accident, occurred two days later, the Louvre curators were raising the 1.5-ton-painting to a higher position upon the display-wall when a support-frame failed and collapsed. In falling to the museum floor, the metal framework that held and transported the painting punctured and tore the canvas; fortuitously, the five punctures and tears affected only the architectural and background areas of the painting, and not the faces of the wedding guests.

The coeducational organization has 1,000 members (as of 2008).  History  The first Romanian Guide groups were founded in 1928. The organizer and Chief of the Guides Movement was Princess Ileana, the daughter of Queen Marie. However, activities ceased in 1938 due to political constraints, and contact was lost. In 1990, after the political change in Romania, a committee was formed to restart Guiding in Romania upon the initiative of members of the Greek Soma Hellinidon Odigon. The Asocia»õia Ghidelor »ôi Ghizilor din Rom√¢nia was set up in 1990 and became a corporate body on March 1, 1991.

While working towards full membership, the AGGR started a partnership with the Swiss Guide and Scout Movement. The AGGR held its first national camp in summer 2006.  Program and ideals The AGGR's logo is the yellow trefoil.

DLA is a packet writing technology for CD and DVD media that uses the UDF file system. DLA is not compatible with Windows Vista and newer, although a patch exists to fix this issue under Windows Vista. Roxio Burn was introduced on April 30, 2009. As a replacement for DLA, it remedies compatibility issues Internet Explorer 8.  History  DLA was originally developed by VERITAS Software and later sold to Sonic Solutions in 2002. It was common as it was shipped with a majority of CD and DVD recording drives, where DLA came as a custom OEM version for the branded drive. Also, most PC systems from Dell, HP, IBM, Sony and Toshiba came with DLA pre-installed. An OEM version was often available for download for the specific computer system. With Windows Vista support for DLA was either dropped or it was replaced by a similar product, like Drag-to-Disc.  Technology  To use an optical medium such as a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD¬±R or DVD¬±RW just like a floppy drive it is necessary to utilize a technique called packet writing. After formatting the optical media it is then possible to write data in small packets, hence the name ‚Äúpacket writing.‚Äù The optical drive unit has to support the ability to write in small units, which all modern CD and DVD recording drives do. This way it is possible to save files onto optical media, as well as change, rename or delete them, or copy files separately onto the media. Without packet writing, optical media like the above-mentioned would have to be written on in one big block, like Disc At Once (DAO), Session At Once (SAO) and Track At Once (TAO), because these media types normally do not support sectors. After formatting with packet writing the medium is sectored in blocks that can be written to individually. The preferred file system is the Universal Disk Format (UDF) in versions from 1.50 onward, which is also used by DLA. Packet writing is not required for writing DVD-RAM. DVD-RAM media are already sectored (which can be seen when looking at the surface of an empty DVD-RAM disc) and the hardware logic of DVD-RAM capable drives supports sectored read/write operations as required by the DVD- RAM standard. However, for Windows up to 2000, DLA will also add support for DVD-RAM together with the UDF file system, for Windows XP DLA will only add the UDF support. DLA also supports the Mount Rainier standard with MRW capable drives. For Windows up to XP DLA will provide this functionality as well as the UDF support. Windows XP is the first Windows operating system to support DVD-RAM. Windows Vista is the first Windows operating system to support full UDF functionality (UDF up to version 2.50, full support meaning read and write operations) and Mount Rainier.  Versions  DLA is available only for Microsoft Windows operating systems and only in the English language. * Version 4.95 runs on Windows 98SE, Me, NT 4.0, 2000 and XP. * Version 5.21 is the most recent version for Windows 98SE, Me, 2000 and XP. Note: Most OEM versions officially support only Windows 2000 and XP; however, DLA itself also runs on older versions of Windows, like Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows Me, as well as Windows NT 4.0. A patch is required for Windows Vista compatibility, but it only works on the retail or trial version. The one exception is the Dell OEM version, but instead of patching DLA it will simply install Drag-to-Disc as a replacement.  Known problems  * DLA is not compatible with Internet Explorer 8. * DLA can cause stop errors (BSoD) on the Windows Server 2003 operating system. * DLA can lock up a Windows XP system when a rewritable (RW) disc is inserted. * DLA may prevent ejection of media from an optical drive. When this occurs, a solution is to restart the operating system. * DLA may prevent installation of a program distributed on a rewritable CD or DVD. A solution is to deactivate DLA as follows: #Launch Windows Explorer or open its My Computer component. #Select the RW drive. #Right click on the drive. #Click \\"Properties\\" #Click the \\"Hardware\\" tab #Deselect (uncheck) \`Use with DLA\` * DLA can block upgrade to Windows 7 on Vista systems where this is installed, and can be very difficult to uninstall.

He played college basketball at the University of Illinois. Early years Pearson attended Freeport High School, where he received All-State honors as the center of the basketball team. He also competed in football and track. After writing a letter to head coach Harry Combes, he walked on at the University of Illinois. In college, he was moved to guard and became a two-year starter. He was known primarily for his tough defense and was one of the few players who ever blocked a \\"skyhook\\" shot by Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Although he possessed the athletic and leaping ability, he never developed his offensive game, finishing his career with a 6.7 points average in 47 games. As a senior, he was named a starter at guard, averaging 8.7 points and 6.0 rebounds per game. In 2017, he was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame. Professional career =Baltimore Colts= Pearson was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the twelfth round (298th overall) of the 1967 NFL Draft, despite never playing a down of college football, after the team was impressed with his speed and athleticism. He was first tried at defensive back and was promoted from the taxi squad to the regular roster on November 1, playing mostly on special teams. In 1968, he was moved to running back and became a captain of the special teams units after leading the league in kickoff returns with a 35.1-yard average. He registered the longest kickoff return of the year in the NFL (102-yards). He averaged more than 4 yards per carry, scored on two pass receptions and had a kickoff return for a 96-yard touchdown. On May 31, 1970, he was traded along with defensive back Ocie Austin to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for linebacker Ray May and a twelfth round draft choice (#294-Bobby Wuensch). =Pittsburgh Steelers= In 1970, he reunited with head coach Chuck Noll who was the defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Colts. He became the starter at running back in his first year with the team. In 1971, he was the fifteenth ranked running back in the AFC with 605 yards (second on the team). In 1972, he was the eighth leading rusher in the AFC through the first 4 games, until he tore his left hamstring against the Houston Oilers. He was replaced with rookie Franco Harris, who would not relinquish the position again on his way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 1973, he was switched to wide receiver during training camp, but was moved back to running back before the start of the season. His relationship with Noll eventually became strained, because of being an outspoken person and his role as one of the Steelers player representatives during the 1974 strike. In 1974, he was the team's third leading rusher even though he missed five games with a hamstring injury. On September 16, 1975, the team waived him after deciding to keep rookie running back Mike Collier instead. At the time, only six players in franchise history had run for more yards. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 19, 1975, after losing Calvin Hill and Walt Garrison, the Dallas Cowboys were looking for an experienced running back, so they signed Pearson as a free agent and in turn waived rookie quarterback Jim Zorn to make room for him on the roster. It has been noted that the acquisition of Pearson and the success of the Dirty Dozen draft were the key reasons that helped the team reached the Super Bowl that year. His best season came in 1975, when he became a starter and rushed for 509 yards, caught 27 passes for 351 yards, and gained another 391 yards on kickoff returns. He then went on to assist the Cowboys to a Super Bowl X appearance by catching 12 passes for over 200 yards and three touchdowns in their two playoff games, including a 7 reception for 123 yards and three receiving touchdowns (tied a league record) performance against the heavily favored Los Angeles Rams in the NFC title game. His team ended up losing the Super Bowl to the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Pearson rushing for 14 yards and catching 5 passes for 53 yards. During his time with the Cowboys he was widely recognized as the player who defined the position of \\"third-down back\\", forcing defenses to use nickel schemes to assign a cornerback to cover him, or to double-team him. He was an all-around player, contributing in running, receiving, blocking and special teams. Head coach Tom Landry once said: \\"He's one of the best halfback blockers I've seen\\". In 1976, he was limited after having knee surgery for a training camp injury. Although he was named the starting running back at the beginning of the year, he was able to start just two games in the regular season. He appeared in 10 games, posting 68 carries for 233 yards, one rushing touchdown, 23 receptions for 316 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. In 1977, he began the season as the starter at running back, before giving way to Tony Dorsett after the ninth game, he set the franchise record for receptions by a running back and finished second on the team with 46, while also tallying 535 receiving yards (second on the team). In 1978, he led the team and broke his own club season record for receptions by a running back with 47, while collecting 526 receiving yards (second on the team). In 1979, he registered 26 receptions (23 for first downs) for 333 receiving yards, one receiving touchdown, 7 carries for 14 yards and one rushing touchdown. In the 35-34 win against the Washington Redskins, he collected 5 catches for 108 yards. He also had a diving 26-yard touchdown reception at the end of the first half, and 2 catches for 47 yards in the final drive, including a 25-yarder that set up the winning touchdown at the Redskins' eight yard line. In his last season he was used mostly as a receiver out of the backfield and retired on July 15, 1981. Legacy Throughout his NFL career, Pearson was used frequently as a rusher, receiver, and kickoff returner on special teams. He played for some of the most famous teams of his era, and played in five Super Bowls (Super Bowl III, IX, X, XII, and XIII) ‚Äì tied for third most all-time. In his 14 NFL seasons, he rushed for 3,609 yards, caught 254 passes for 3,095 yards, returned seven punts for 40 yards, and gained 2,801 yards on kickoff returns. Overall, Pearson gained 9,545 total yards and scored 33 touchdowns (17 rushing, 13 receiving, two kickoff returns and one fumble recovery). He was the first player to appear in the Super Bowl with 3 different teams. Pearson also holds the distinction of being one of the few, if not the only, players to have been led by Don Shula, Chuck Noll and Tom Landry ‚Äî three of the greatest coaches in NFL history with eight Super Bowl titles among them. Not only were his coaches Hall of Famers, but also his quarterbacks (Johnny Unitas, Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach), fellow running backs (Lenny Moore, Franco Harris and Tony Dorsett) are also enshrined in Canton. Personal life In 1981, Pearson teamed with self-promoter Janie Tilford to form Pro-Style Associates. Pro- Style began by matching corporations with athletic talent to create a unique marketing endeavor for special events. Preston is the president of Pro-Style Associates. During the formation of the Asia Pacific Football League, Pearson was contracted by the league to consult and assist the league in its organizational efforts. What became of his role is unknown as the APFL was never formed. Pearson wrote a 1985 memoir, Hearing the Noise, My Life in the NFL, .

It is involved in the coordination of eye movements, particularly horizontal gaze and saccades.  Input, output, and function  The PPRF is located anterior and lateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). It receives input from the superior colliculus via the predorsal bundle and from the frontal eye fields via frontopontine fibers. The rostral PPRF probably coordinates vertical saccades; the caudal PPRF may be the generator of horizontal saccades. In particular, activity of the excitatory burst neurons (EBNs) in the PPRF generates the \\"pulse\\" movement that initiates a saccade. In the case of horizontal saccades the \\"pulse\\" information is conveyed via axonal fibres to the abducens nucleus, initiating lateral eye movements. The angular velocity of the eye during horizontal saccade ranges from 100 to 700 degrees per second. Larger saccades have faster pulses; the PPRF is involved in this determination.

It was both a civil parish, used for administrative purposes, and an ecclesiastical parish of the Church of England.  Civil parish  Hornsey Parish was probably formed in about the thirteenth century at the time a church was built in the village of Hornsey. The Parish fell within the Ossulstone Hundred of Middlesex, and in later times it was part of the Finsbury division of the Hundred. The Hornsey Parish boundary ran from Stoke Newington, in the south, through Stroud Green to Highgate in the west, and from near Colney Hatch in the north, past Muswell Hill, and a detached portion of Clerkenwell Parish, eastwards to the Tottenham Parish border and then along Green Lanes back to Stoke Newington. In the north a field called Hornsey Detached No.1 stretched up to Colney Hatch and at the southern end there were another two fields, Hornsey Detached Nos. 2 and 3 by Newington Green. The parish also owned another field in Canonbury, Islington, which was surrendered to the Parish by Sir Thomas Draper, Bt., in 1668. The vestry of the parish was entrusted with various civil administrative functions from the 17th century. Unusually the parish was divided between the Highgate (upper) side and the Hornsey (lower) side, and separate vestry officers appointed for each side.Vestry Minutes in London Metropolitan Archives. After 1837 the civil administration changed. The Hornsey vestry established a Public Health and Drainage committee in 1851; this committee only had a short life as it was replaced, in 1854, with a Highways Board, and a full Local Board was established in 1867. The Local Board gave way to the Urban District Council in 1894/5 which governed the Parish until 1903, when it became obtained Borough status. By this time South Hornsey had separated and become an autonomous local authority from Hornsey, which had become part of the Poor Law Union of Edmonton. In 1865, the southern part of the parish, consisting of the Brownswood Park area and the detached pieces surrounded by the parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington adopted the Local Government Act 1858, and formed the South Hornsey Local Board. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the two local board districts as urban districts, and divided the parish into the two civil parishes of Hornsey and South Hornsey. In 1899 the South Hornsey urban district and civil parish were absorbed by the Metropolitan Boroughs of Stoke Newington and Islington in the County of London. At the same time the detached part of the parish of Clerkenwell was added to Hornsey. The urban district and civil parish of Hornsey remained in Middlesex, being incorporated as the Municipal Borough of Hornsey in 1903. The civil parish was abolished when the borough became part of the London Borough of Haringey in 1965.  Ecclesiastical parish  The ancient parish, dedicated to St Mary, was in the Diocese of London. From 1862, as the population of Hornsey increased, a number of new parishes were formed: * Hornsey, Christ Church, Crouch End in 1862 * Hornsey, Holy Innocents in 1877 * Hornsey, St Peter in 1898 * Hornsey, St Luke in 1903 * Hornsey St George in 1910 The parishes of Hornsey Rise and Hornsey Road were formed in 1865 and 1866 respectively. The two parishes were formed out of part of the area of the ancient parish of Islington. In addition, as the population of neighbouring areas increased, parts of Hornsey parish were included in new parishes: * Highgate in 1834 * Muswell Hill, St James in 1843 * Stoke Newington, St Matthias in 1849 * Highgate, All Saints in 1874 * Brownswood Park in 1875 was formed from the southern part of the parish * Stroud Green in 1881 * Harringay in 1892  References   External links  * Hornsey and Highgate * Local Government in Hornsey * View of Hornsey Church * Hornsey Churches * Hornsey Historical Society  Sources  * Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.1, Frederic Youngs, London, 1979 Category:History of the London Borough of Haringey Category:Religion in the London Borough of Haringey Category:History of local government in London (pre-1855) Category:Former civil parishes in London Category:Hornsey ","title":"Hornsey (parish)"},{"id":"3877308","text":"William Kyle Rote, Sr. (October 27, 1928 ‚Äì August 15, 2002) was an American football player, a running back and receiver for eleven years in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants. He was an All-American running back at Southern Methodist University and was the first overall selection of the 1951 NFL Draft. Following his playing career, Rote was the Giants backfield coach and was a sports broadcaster for WNEW radio, NBC, and WNBC New York. Early life Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, Rote was the son of Jack and Emma Belle (Owens) Rote. His family suffered tragedies during World War II; when he was 16, his mother was killed in a car accident and his older brother Jack was killed on Iwo Jima. Rote attended Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio, where he earned All-State honors in both football and basketball, while also being considered one of the region's brightest pro- baseball prospects. He was a running back in football, a guard in basketball, an outfielder in baseball, and a member of the track team.Rick Alonzo. \\"Kyle Rote: 1928‚Äì2002 ‚Äì SMU, NFL great called 'whole package' ‚Äì Versatile player turned broadcaster dies of pneumonia at 73,\\" The Dallas Morning News, August 16, 2002, page 1A. =Collegiate career= After graduating from high school in 1947, Rote accepted an athletic scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where he became one of the most celebrated collegiate football players in the country. In December 1949, in a near upset over eventual national champion Notre Dame, Rote ran for 115 yards, threw for 146 yards, and scored all three SMU touchdowns in a 27‚Äì20 loss. His performance was voted by the Texas Sportswriters Association as \\"The Outstanding Individual Performance by a Texas Athlete in the First Half of the 20th Century.\\" Twenty-five years later, Notre Dame made Rote an \\"Honorary Member\\" of their Championship Team. Rote still holds the national collegiate record for the longest punt. In the Cotton Bowl against Oregon in January 1949, SMU was on their own four-yard-line after a Norm Van Brocklin punt. Nearing halftime, Rote quick-kicked on first down from his own end zone, and the ball ended up 84 yards from the line of scrimmage, on the Oregon In his senior year at SMU in 1950, Rote was runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, won by of Ohio State. While in college, Rote also played baseball and ran track for the Mustangs; he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1964. Immediately after graduation at SMU, Rote signed a contract with the Corpus Christi Aces of the Class B Gulf Coast Baseball League. In 23 games his batting average was .348. National Football League career The New York Giants selected Rote with the first overall pick in the 1951 NFL Draft. He started out as a running back, but after the first two years switched to wide receiver due to a knee injury. When Rote retired after the 1961 season, he had become the Giants' career leader in pass receptions (300), receiving yardage (4,805), and touchdown receptions (48). He was second highest in total touchdowns (56) and fifth-leading scorer (312 points). His average gain per catch was 15.9 yards. In all, Rote played in four world championship games, including the 1956 NFL Championship Game against the Chicago Bears, and the 1958 game won by the Baltimore Colts in sudden-death overtime known as The Greatest Game, the first ever nationally televised NFL championship game. Rote was the captain of the New York Giants for eight years. Rote spearheaded the movement that became the NFL Players Association, fighting for equal opportunities for all players, so that all players of all races would receive equal treatment when the teams played on the road. Rote became the NFLPA's first elected president serving for several years, and also acted as the Giants team representative. Rote was inducted into the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame, Texas Sports Hall of Fame, College Football Hall of Fame, Texas Pro Football Hall of Fame, San Antonio Hall of Fame, Texas High School Football Hall of Fame, Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame, Southwest Conference All-Time Team, and received the SMU Distinguished Alumni Award. In 1995, Rote was named as wide receiver on the All-Time Giants Team in conjunction with the 75th celebration of the founding of the NFL. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Rote to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2006 Rote retired in April 1962, then was the Giants' backfield coach for two seasons; in both those years, New York captured the NFL's Eastern Division championship, a third consecutive in 1963, but fell in each of the title games. Sportscasting career While in the NFL, Rote spent the offseasons as the sports director for radio station WNEW. In the 1960s and early 1970s, like his former Giant teammates Frank Gifford, Pat Summerall, and Thomas Conlin, he enjoyed a second career as a sportscaster, working at NBC and WNBC New York on radio and television. Rote is generally believed to be the first athlete to use the popular slogan, \\"You cannot stop a great player like (ex. Jim Brown), you can only hope to contain him.\\" The phrase is now used commonly to describe different players, and was made popular by former ESPN Sportscaster Dan Patrick, albeit jokingly, using the line to describe marginal competitors. Personal life Rote and his first wife, Elizabeth Jeanett Jamison, married in 1949 and had four children ‚Äì Kyle, Gary, Chris, and Elizabeth. His oldest son, Kyle Rote, Jr., was one of the first notable soccer stars from the United States. He said of his father, \\"To me the most remarkable thing about him from a football standpoint was that he had fourteen teammates who named their sons after him.\\" In 1965, Rote married Sharon Ritchie (Miss America 1956); they were divorced in 1973. Rote married Betty-Nina Langmack in 1976. Rote was the cousin of Tobin Rote, a multi-championship winning and record holding AFL and NFL quarterback. Rote authored the books, Pro Football for the Fans and The Language of Pro Football, and wrote the Giants Fight Song. He also published two volumes of poetry, was an ASCAP songwriter, accomplished pianist, and oil painter having a number of his works shown at museums throughout the United States.

Life He was born in S√§ckingen, Baden, Germany. After entering the Society of Jesus in 1589 and completing his studies, he taught the classics at Freiburg and was professor of philosophy and of moral and dogmatic theology at Ingolstadt. He was appointed rector of the college of Ratisbon in 1605, and of the college of Munich in 1607, a post he held until 1623. In 1628 he was reappointed to the rectorship of Munich, and was still holding the office when an apoplexy ended his life. He was consulted by Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, who entrusted to him some important affairs. He died in Munich. Works His major works are: Tyrannicidium (Munich, 1611) and Catholisch Pabsttumb (Munich, 1614). The former, which appeared both in German and Latin, was an answer to a Calvinist attack on the teaching of the Society of Jesus on the subject of tyrannicide in which Keller argued that the Jesuit teaching followed prominent theologians, both Catholic and Protestant. The work on the Papacy was a reply to Jacob Heilbrunner (1548‚Äì1618), a Lutheran court theologian; http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/h/heilbrunner_j.shtml it comprised a collection of answers to objections of Protestants. It was followed by a public debate between Keller and Heilbrunner. Keller published four other works on the subject.

As such, it was an important military holding in the Zaian War. French General Paul Prosper Henrys had planned to lead the first attack on Khenifra on 10 June 1914. There would be three columns of troops, totaling up to 14,000 officers, to take Khenifra from the Zayanes control.. One column was under Lieutenant-Colonel Henri Claudel, one under Colonel Gaston Cros, and one under Colonel No√´l Garnier-Duplessix.. Mouha ou Hammou Zayani led troops to attempt to stop the Khenifra campaign, but was eventually unsuccessful.. The French took control of the town, but with losing around 600 men. In addition to leading the Zayanes, Hammou was responsible for much of the early 20th century development of Khenifra, having overseen the development of accommodations and mosques in the town.

The lower density of interior hot air compared to cool ambient air causes an upward force on the envelope. This is very similar to a hot air balloon, with the notable exception that an airship has a powered means of propulsion, whilst a hot air balloon relies on winds for navigation. An airship that uses steam would also qualify as a thermal airship.Steam Balloon JBFA Article Other types of airships use a gas that is lighter than air at ambient temperature, such as helium, as a lifting gas. Some airship designs that use a lighter-than-air lifting gas heat a portion of the gas, which is usually maintained in enclosed cells to gain additional lift. Heating the lifting gas causes expansion of the gas in order to further lower the density of the lifting gas, which results in greater lift. Advantages and disadvantages Thermal airships have the advantage of being much less expensive than helium-based airships. They are also routinely deflated after each flight and can be readily packed for storage and/or transport, making them blimps rather than rigid airships. Hot air craft produce much less uplift per unit volume than helium- or hydrogen- filled craft (about 30% depending on air conditions). This necessitates lighter construction, with fewer controls and hence more difficulty in maneuvering. This leads to: *lower airspeeds *difficulty in handling on the ground if the ground wind is above 5 knots *difficulty in steering, particularly at low air speeds *lack of elevator (pitch) control, causing the airship to pitch up or down in response to changes in the throttle setting (a motion called 'porpoising') In recent years, the steering of these ships has improved somewhat. The most successful approach has been to use higher pressure in the tail fin structures than in the rest of the envelope, or to use an internal structure (see below). History Skyacht Personal Blimp - another type of thermal airship The first public flight of a hot air airship was made by Don Cameron (UK) in a Cameron D-96 at the Icicle Meet in January 1973. The aircraft took 3 years to develop. Envelope structures Most thermal airships are non-rigid. Some are pressurized. In some cases, the pressurized air is taken from a duct located behind the propeller. In other cases, the pressurized air comes from a separate fan. In 2006, a new type of envelope employing a tensile membrane structure was developed by Skyacht Aircraft. This design uses an unpressurized envelope and an internal structure that uses ribs made of aluminium to keep the envelope in shape. When not in use, the structure folds up in a manner similar to an umbrella. The structure also permits the mounting of a steerable engine/propeller on the tail of the aircraft. The tail-mounted propeller provides for vectored thrust steering, allowing tight turns.Youtube video of Skyacht Operation Like hot air balloons, thermal airships are first inflated partially with cold (ambient temperature) air. Once the envelopes are sufficiently full, a propane burner is ignited and the inflation is completed using heated air.

Created and written by Miles Tredinnick, the six- episode series was transmitted in the autumn of 1988. Alan J. W. Bell directed and the music was composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst. Although not initially written with him in mind, the series was developed as a vehicle for Wilde after he had left the cast of Last of the Summer Wine three years prior. Although initially getting passable ratings, the BBC felt that the sitcom had not really caught on, and it was dropped after one series; Wilde returned to Last of the Summer Wine in 1990. Overview The show was set in the fictional commuter village of Bradly Bush although actually filmed on location in Claygate, Surrey, England. Retired soldier Major John Wyatt (Brian Wilde) is spurred into action after his sister Edwina‚Äôs (Anne Ridler) home is burgled in broad daylight. Ignoring correct police procedures, he forms his own Neighbourhood Watch group of incompetents and patrols the streets in his Range Rover known locally as the ‚ÄòDogmobile‚Äô. The Watch members are a hopeless bunch drawn together to fight crime, and bungling and personality clashes are highly evident. Brian Wilde as Major Wyatt clashes worst of all with Peter Pitt (Trevor Bannister), a smooth-talking womaniser and burglar-alarm salesman. He only has two things in mind - to flog his alarms and meet women! Other regular characters include the glamorous man-eater Virginia (April Walker), an interfering Vicar (David Jackson), and a frustrated police sergeant, Springer (James Warrior). The show actually had the working title of Every Street Should Have One but this was changed at the last minute to Wyatt's Watchdogs. The reason being that the BBC were transmitting the programme on Monday evenings straight after ITV's Coronation Street but before another BBC show called Streets Apart. Much of the series was devised to act as a vehicle for Wilde, who had left his role as Foggy Dewhurst in Last of the Summer Wine in 1985 over creative differences with Alan J. W. Bell. The character of Wyatt shared a number of similarities with Foggy, particularly with them both having a military background, although Wyatt was far more assertive and not afraid of conflict as Foggy was. Although it performed moderately in its time-slot, the BBC felt - who had hoped that, starring Wilde, it would have gained much of Last of the Summer Wines viewing figures - that the programme had not really caught on with viewers, and it was dropped after its initial series. However, with the production of this series, Wilde and Bell managed to settle their differences regarding Last of the Summer Wine, and the following year in 1989, when the next series of Summer Wine was due to start filming and actor Michael Aldridge having to leave the show for personal reasons, the character of Seymour Utterthwaite had to be replaced and Brian agreed to return as Foggy Dewhurst, staying with the series for seven more years.

Since 2017, he has served as a judge of the Provincial Court of Alberta. From 1997 to 2014, he was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing Edmonton-Whitemud as a Progressive Conservative until announcing resigning from the legislature on September 12, 2014. Early life Hancock was born August 10, 1955 in Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories, grew up in Hazelton, British Columbia, went to high school in Fort Vermilion, Alberta before moving to Edmonton in 1972. He went to the UofA for his undergraduate degree in Political Science, graduated in 1975, was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity at UofA and received his law degree. Hancock was politically involved from a young age, serving as the president of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta's youth wing from 1974‚Äì1976 and later served as party president from 1990‚Äì1992. Under his leadership, the Progressive Conservative Party instituted a one-member-one-vote system for leadership conventions, introduced a Statement of Principles and a grassroots policy development process. Before being elected, Hancock was a partner with Matheson and Company, Barristers and Solicitors. Political career =Electoral record= Hancock was defeated by Mike Percy in the 1993 election. Mike Percy's retirement after serving one term in the Legislature for the Alberta Liberal Party left open the constituency of Edmonton-Whitemud, the riding once held by former Premier Don Getty. Hancock secured the PC nomination and squared off against Corky Meyer of the Liberals and Charan Khehra of the Alberta New Democratic Party in the 1997 provincial election. He won the constituency with 51 per cent of the vote, beating runner-up Meyer by 2,020 votes and was one of only two Progressive Conservatives elected in Edmonton's 19 constituencies (Julius Yankowsky, Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview, was the other.) Hancock was returned to the Legislature in the 2001 provincial election, increasing his share of the popular vote to 59 per cent. He defeated Liberal candidate Bruce King by 4,381 votes. In the 2004 provincial election, Hancock was one of only three out of 10 incumbent PC MLAs in Edmonton to retain their seat by defeating Liberal Donna Smith by 929 votes while winning 46 per cent of the vote and was elected to his fourth term in the 2008 provincial election, winning 58 per cent of the vote in beating Liberal Nancy Cavanaugh by 5,049 votes. =In Cabinet= Hancock has spent his entire provincial political career in cabinet. As a rookie MLA in the 24th Alberta Legislature, Premier Ralph Klein named him Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs. In that capacity, he spearheaded the creation of the Aboriginal Policy Framework, which set out the basic structure for existing and new governmental policies regarding aboriginal affairs. Two years into his first term, Hancock was promoted to Minister of Justice and Solicitor General and Government House Leader. During his five years as Justice Minister, he worked to limit conditional sentencing for violent crime, drunk driving offenders, developed a flagging system to identify Alberta's chronic drunk drivers and introduced specialized domestic violence courts. Hancock remained Justice and Solicitor General Minister and House Leader after his re-election in 2001, but was also given the job of Attorney General. He served in those roles until after the 2004 election, when Klein appointed him Minister of Advanced Education. During his time in that job, Hancock was most noted for passing the Access to the Future Act, which created a $1 billion endowment fund for post-secondary education; known valued at $3 billion and approved degree-granting status for several small colleges in the province. When Ed Stelmach won the leadership and subsequently became Premier in December 2006, he promoted Hancock to the health portfolio. As Minister, he presided over funding increases for the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute, enhanced access to cardiac, cancer care through process improvements, an increase of primary care networks to 8 across the province, initiated several health prevention measures: including a wellness fund for healthy communities, expansion of metabolic screening, and a new colorectal cancer screening program. Stelmach appointed Hancock Minister of Education following the provincial election in March 2008. He has approved funding increases to accredited private schools, and announced plans to build 18 new schools in Edmonton and Calgary. On December 6, 2013, Hancock was appointed as Deputy Premier, Minister of Innovation and Advanced Education and was the Minister of Human Services and Government House Leader under the Redford government. =2006 Leadership bid= In April 2006, Hancock resigned his post as Minister of Advanced Education and announced his intentions to replace Klein as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. He was considered a long shot against favourites like former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning and Ted Morton. His leadership campaign was managed by Brian Mulawka. It was headquartered in Edmonton where he had been an MLA and where most of his support. Hancock was unable to secure any endorsements from PC caucus members, but was endorsed by Edmonton-Centre Conservative MP Laurie Hawn and placed fifth on the first ballot, garnering 7,595 votes, more than 20,000 votes behind first place Dinning. Having achieved only 2% of the votes cast, Hancock gained the nickname ‚ÄúMr 2%‚Äù. Hancock, along with five others, were dropped from the second ballot and with fellow leadership candidates Mark Norris and Lyle Oberg, supported Stelmach on the final ballot. =Premiership= Following the announcement of Alison Redford's resignation as both leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and premier, he was named interim party leader by the Progressive Conservative caucus on March 20, 2014, and, with such confidence from the majority of the legislature, was appointed as Premier of Alberta. Hancock was sworn in at Government House on March 23, 2014. Hancock was succeeded as Premier and PC party leader by Jim Prentice on September 15, 2014. Hancock also retired from the legislature on the same day. He is the shortest serving premier in the province's history. Hancock's official portrait as Premier was unveiled on February 13, 2017. Hancock joked at the ceremony saying that his premiership was \\"the best summer job that I‚Äôve ever had\\", and that he expected his portrait to be \\"one the size of a postage stamp\\" based on the short length of his administration. Other politicians in attendance paid tribute to Hancock's long hours in the legislature to pass legislation, and his lengthy tenure in government holding eight cabinet portfolios. Personal life Hancock lives in Edmonton with his wife Janet, who is a principal at Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton. He has three children.

The condition is caused by a variety of molds and fungi, and individual forms include pythiosis, zygomycosis, and lagenidiosis. Pythiosis is the most common type and is caused by Pythium, a type of water mould. Zygomycosis can also be caused by two types of zygomycetes, Entomophthorales (such as Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus) and Mucorales (such as Mucor, Mortierella, Absidia, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, and Saksenaea). The latter type of zygomycosis is also referred to as mucormycosis. Lagenidiosis is caused by a Lagenidium species, which like Pythium is a water mould. Since both pythiosis and lagenidiosis are caused by organisms from the class Oomycetes, they are sometimes collectively referred to as oomycosis. Pythiosis Ulcerative and destructive skin lesion on a dog caused by Pythium insidiosum Pythiosis is caused by Pythium insidiosum and occurs most commonly in dogs and horses, but is also found in cats, cattle, and humans. In the United States it is most commonly found in the Gulf states, especially Louisiana, but has been found in midwest and eastern states. It is also found in southeast Asia, eastern Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Pythiosis occurs in areas with mild winters due to the organism surviving in standing water that does not reach freezing temperatures. Pythium occupies swamps in late summer and infects dogs who drink water containing it. The disease is typically found in young, large breed dogs. It is suspected that pythiosis is caused by invasion of the organism into wounds, either in the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract. The disease grows slowly in the stomach and small intestine, eventually forming large lumps of granulation tissue. It can also invade surrounding lymph nodes. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, depression, weight loss, and a mass in the abdomen. Pythiosis of the skin in dogs is very rare, and appears as ulcerated lumps. Primary infection can also occur in the bones and lungs. Pythium hyphae In horses, subcutaneous pythiosis is the most common form and infection occurs through a wound while standing in water containing the pathogen. The disease is also known as leeches, swamp cancer, and bursatti. Lesions are most commonly found on the lower limbs, abdomen, chest, and genitals. They are granulomatous and itchy, and may be ulcerated or fistulated. The lesions often contain yellow, firm masses of dead tissue known as kunkers. It is possible with chronic infection for the disease to spread to underlying bone. In humans it can cause arteritis, keratitis, and periorbital cellulitis. In cats pythioisis is almost always confined to the skin as hairless and edematous lesions. It is usually found on the limbs, perineum, and at the base of the tail. Lesions may also develop in the nasopharynx. Pythium insidiosum is different from other members of the genus in that human and horse hair, skin, and decaying animal tissue are chemoattractants for its zoospores, in addition to decaying plant tissue. Zygomycosis A mature sporangium of a Mucor sp. fungus Zygomycosis usually is a disease of the skin, but can also occur in the sinuses or gastrointestinal tract. In humans it is most prevalent in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS, the elderly, SCID, etc) and patients in acidosis (diabetes, burns), particularly after barrier injury to the skin or mucus membranes. Zygomycosis caused by Mucorales causes a rapidly progressing disease of sudden onset in sick or immunocompromised animals. Entomophthorales cause chronic, local infections in otherwise healthy animals. The important species that cause entomophthoromycosis are Conidiobolus coronatus, C. incongruous, and Basidiobolus ranarum. Conidiobolus infections of the upper respiratory system have been reported in humans, sheep, horses, and dogs, and Basidiobolus has been reported less commonly in humans and dogs. Horses are one of the most common domestic animals to be affected by entomophthoromycosis. C. coronatus causes lesions in the nasal and oral mucosa of horses that may cause nasal discharge or difficulty breathing. B. ranarum causes large circular nodules on the upper body and neck of horses. Entomophthorales is found in soil and decaying plant matter, and specifically Basidiobolus can be contracted from insects and the feces of reptiles or amphibians. Zygomycosis of the sinuses can extend from the sinuses into the orbit and the cranial vault, leading to rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Lagenidiosis The best known species of Lagenidium is Lagenidium giganteum, a parasite of mosquito larvae used in biological control of mosquitoes. Two different species cause disease exclusively in dogs: L. caninum and L. karlingii. Lagenidiosis is found in the southeastern United States in lakes and ponds. It causes progressive skin and subcutaneous lesions in the legs, groin, trunk, and near the tail. The lesions are firm nodules or ulcerated regions with draining tracts. Regional lymph nodes are usually swollen. Spread of the disease to distant lymph nodes, large blood vessels, and the lungs may occur. An aneurysm of a great vessel can rupture and cause sudden death. L. caninum is the more aggressive species and is more likely to spread to other organs than L. karlingii. Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis is through biopsy or culture, although an ELISA test has been developed for Pythium insidiosum in animals. Treatment is very difficult and includes surgery when possible. Postoperative recurrence is common. Antifungal drugs show only limited effect on the disease, but itraconazole and terbinafine hydrochloride are often used for two to three months following surgery. Humans with Basidiobolus infections have been treated with amphotericin B and potassium iodide. For pythiosis and lagenidiosis, a new drug targeting water moulds called caspofungin is available, but it is very expensive. Immunotherapy has been used successfully in humans and horses with pythiosis. The prognosis for any type of phycomycosis is poor.

Long regarded as being caused by a fungus, the causative agent was not discovered until 1987. It occurs most commonly in horses, dogs, and humans, with isolated cases in other large mammals. The disease is contracted after exposure to stagnant fresh water such as swamps, ponds, lakes, and rice paddies. P. insidiosum is different from other members of the genus in that human and horse hair, skin, and decaying animal and plant tissue are chemoattractants for its zoospores. Additionally, it is the only member in the genus known to infect mammals, while other members are pathogenic to plants and are responsible for some well-known plant diseases. Epidemiology Pythiosis occurs in areas with mild winters because the organism survives in standing water that does not reach freezing temperatures. In the United States, it is most commonly found in the Southern Gulf states, especially Louisiana, Florida, and Texas, but has also been reported as far away as California and Wisconsin.Gastrointestinal pythiosis in 10 dogs from California.

It is also found in southeast Asia, eastern Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Pathophysiology Pythiosis is suspected to be caused by invasion of the organism into wounds, either in the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract. The disease grows slowly in the stomach and small intestine, eventually forming large lumps of granulation tissue. It can also invade surrounding lymph nodes. In different animals The species are listed in decreasing frequency of infection. =Horses= In horses, subcutaneous pythiosis is the most common form and infection occurs through a wound while standing in water containing the pathogen. The disease is also known as leeches, swamp cancer, and bursatti. Lesions are most commonly found on the lower limbs, abdomen, chest, and genitals. They are granulomatous and itchy, and may be ulcerated or fistulated. The lesions often contain yellow, firm masses of dead tissue known as 'kunkers'. It is possible with chronic infection for the disease to spread to underlying bone. =Dogs= Pythiosis of the skin in dogs is rare, and appears as ulcerated lumps. Primary infection can also occur in the bones and lungs. Dogs with the gastrointestinal form of pythiosis have severe thickening of one or more portions of the gastrointestinal tract that may include the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, or in rare cases, even the esophagus. The resulting pathology results in anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), and abdominal straining. Extensive weight loss may be evident.Dr. Susan Muller, DVM. http://www.critterology.com/articles/pythiosis-dog =Humans= In humans, it can cause arteritis, keratitis, and periorbital cellulitis. This has previously been thought to be a rare disease with only 28 cases reported in the literature up to 1996. However, keratitis due to Pythium may be more common than previously thought, accounting for a proportion of cases that were due to unidentified pathogens. Although this disease was first reported in 1884 the species infecting humans - Pythium insidiosum - was only formally recognised in 1987. Diagnosis can be difficult in part because of a lack of awareness of the disease. It does not appear to be transmissible either animal to animal or animal to human. There appear to be three clades of this organism: one in the Americas, a second from Asia and Australia and a third with isolates from Thailand and the USA. The most probable origin of the organism seems to be in Asia. Most human cases have been reported in Thailand, although cases have been reported elsewhere. In humans, the four forms of the disease are: subcutaneous, disseminated, ocular, and vascular. The ocular form of the disease is the only one known to infect otherwise healthy humans, and has been associated with contact lens use while swimming in infected water. This is also the rarest form with most cases requiring enucleation of the eye. The other forms of the disease require a pre-existing medical condition, usually associated with thalassemic hemoglobinopathy. Prognosis is poor to guarded and treatments include aggressive surgical resection of infected tissue, with amputation suggested if the infection is limited to a distal limb followed by immunotherapy and chemotherapy. A recently published review lists nine cases of vascular pythiosis with five survivors receiving surgery with free margins and all except one requiring amputation. The same review lists nine cases of ocular pythiosis with five patients requiring enucnleation of the infected eye and four patients requiring a corneal transplant. =Cats and other animals= In cats, pythioisis is almost always confined to the skin as hairless and edematous lesions. It is usually found on the limbs, perineum, and at the base of the tail. Lesions may also develop in the nasopharynx. Rabbits are susceptible to pythiosis and are used for in vivo studies of the disease. Other animals reported to have contracted pythiosis are bears, jaguars, camels, and birds, although these have only been singular events. Diagnosis and treatment Pythiosis is suspected to be heavily underdiagnosed due to unfamiliarity with the disease, the rapid progression and morbidity, and the difficulty in making a diagnosis. Symptoms often appear once the disease has progressed to the point where treatment are less effective. As the organism is neither a bacterium, virus, nor fungus, routine tests often fail to diagnose it. In cytology and histology, the organism does not stain using Giemsa, H&E;, or Diff-Quick. GMS staining is required to identify the hyphae in slides. Additionally, the symptoms are usually nonspecific and the disease is not normally included in a differential diagnosis. Biopsies of infected tissues are known to be difficult to culture, but can help narrow the diagnosis to several different organisms. A definite diagnosis is confirmed using ELISA testing of serum for pythiosis antibodies, or by PCR testing of infected tissues or cultures. Due to the poor efficacy of single treatments, pythiosis infections are often treated using a variety of different treatments, all with varying success. Most successful treatments include surgery, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Aggressive surgical resection is the treatment of choice for pythiosis. Because it provides the best opportunity for cure, complete excision of infected tissue should be pursued whenever possible. When cutaneous lesions are limited to a single distal extremity, amputation is often recommended. In animals with gastrointestinal pythiosis, segmental lesions should be resected with 5-cm margins whenever possible. Unfortunately, surgical excision of tissue and amputation do not guarantee complete success and lesions can reappear. So, surgery is often followed by other treatments. An immunotherapy product derived from antigens of P. insidiosum has been used successfully to treat pythiosis.Grooters AM, Foil CS. Miscellaneous fungal infections. In: Greene CE, ed.

Controversies A video of a student from Duncanville, 18-year-old sophomore Jeff Bliss scolding his social studies/history teacher, went viral in May 2013, and was picked up by media. CBS local news quoted the student: : \\"You want kids to come into your class? You want them to get excited for this? You gotta come in here and make them excited. You want a kid to change and start doing better? You gotta touch his freakin' heart. Can't expect a kid to change if all you do is just tell 'em.\\" The video was caught on video on a cellphone, posted on YouTube, and picked up by Reddit, PhillyD and Gawker. The official reaction of the Duncanville Independent School District was not to discipline the student, but to offer private and public reminders that there are other ways to make a point. The district issued a statement, saying, in part: \\"He makes a number of valid statements about how classrooms across America need to change, and we view this as an opportunity to have more conversations about transforming our schools to better meet the needs of our students.\\" A video of students protesting the school's strict dress code were sent to several of the local media outlets, who reported on the incident. The Duncanville Independent School District said about 170 students were found in violation of the school's dress code and sent home. The crackdown on students violating the dress code is what led to a spontaneous mass protest. Administrators responded to the protest with a large police presence on campus a day afterward, which remained until the last day of the school year.

He served as the first speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the colony and was a noted philatelist. Cooper was conferred the hereditary title of Cooper baronet of Woollahra in 1863, the second of four baronetcy conferred to British expatriates in the Australian colonies. Early life He was born at Bolton, Lancashire, England, the son of Thomas Cooper, merchant, and his wife Jane Ramsden. He was the nephew of the emancipated convict and extraordinarily successful businessman, Daniel Cooper, who took an interest in the education of his nephew. He was taken to Sydney by his parents when a child, but was sent back to Britain again in 1835 and spent four years at University College London. Cooper began business at Le Havre, France, but his health failing, he returned to Sydney in 1843. There, he acquired an interest in a mercantile firm, afterwards known as D. Cooper and Company, and bought much property in Sydney and its suburbs. This afterwards appreciated in value and Cooper became a wealthy man. In 1853 he inherited the bulk of the enormous fortune of his uncle, Daniel, who had no children. He was an early member of the senate of the University of Sydney, to which he gave ¬£500 for a stained glass window, and ¬£1,000 to found a scholarship. Political career In 1849 at the age of 28, Cooper was made a member of the legislative council, and in 1856 he was elected as a member for Legislative Assembly seat of Sydney Hamlets of the first Parliament of New South Wales. He represented Paddington from 1859 to 1860. At its first meeting, Cooper was elected Speaker by a majority of one vote over Henry Watson Parker. His election was not popular, but Cooper held office with dignity and impartiality and set a standard for future speakers. He successfully established rules of procedure and parliamentary conventions, which influenced the Parliament in the following years. In politics, he was close to Charles Cowper and Henry Parkes and supported Parkes' The Empire, financially. In return it described his political principles as being 'of so liberal a cast that, were he less identified with the great interests of property, he would be set down as a dangerous democrat'. In January 1860 his health was again troubling him and he found it necessary to resign. He was asked to form a ministry in March, but declined and in 1861 returned to Britain. During the Crimean War he had exerted himself in raising a fund for the relief of widows and children of soldiers, and in the UK in 1863 he did much work to relieve the distress in Lancashire caused by the cotton famine. He continued his interest in New South Wales and occasionally acted as agent-general, did useful work in connexion with the exhibition held at Sydney in 1880, and in 1886 was a member of the Royal Commission for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at London. Family He married, in 1846, Elizabeth Hill, daughter of William Hill of Sydney and Mary Johnson, both convicts, and they had two sons and five daughters. Cooper died on 5 June 1902 in Kensington, London, and was survived by his wife and by two sons and three of their daughters. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.Residents of Brompton Cemetery The eldest son, Daniel Cooper (1848-1909), succeeded as second Baronet, but had only daughters and was himself succeeded by his brother William Charles Cooper (1851-1925) as third Baronet.

It was divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. Initially, the British pound circulated, supplemented by local banknotes from 1916. In 1920, Australian coins and banknotes were introduced, although local paper money continued to be produced until 1932. When the Australian pound broke its parity to the pound sterling in 1930 during the great depression, this caused uncertainty in the British territories of the Western Pacific regarding whether their pound unit was a pound sterling or an Australian pound. This uncertainty prevailed into the mid-1930s and was only resolved when the matter was clarified by King's regulations. The final result was that all the British territories apart from Fiji adopted the Australian unit. As such, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate followed the course of Australia. (The end result was that Fiji had a distinct pound of its own that differed in value from the pound sterling as well as from the Australian and New Zealand units. New Zealand was nearly at par with Australia, and all New Zealand controlled territories, notably Western Samoa, adopted the New Zealand unit which was later returned to parity with sterling in 1948. Papua New Guinea, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, the New Hebrides (as regards their sterling accounts), Tonga and Nauru all followed the Australian unit.) Between 1942 and 1944, the Solomon Islands were occupied by Japan and the Oceania pound circulated. The Australian pound returned after the war and was replaced by the Australian dollar in 1966. This was, in turn, replaced by the Solomon Islands dollar in 1977. For a more general view of history in the wider region, see history of pound sterling in Oceania. Banknotes The first currency produced specifically for the British Solomon Islands was authorized by the British Solomon Islands Currency Regulation of 1916. The Western Pacific High Commission passed the King's Regulation No. 10 of 1916 on 14 September 1916. Prior to this regulation, the Solomon Islands used Australian and Burns Philip banknotes. The first notes worth a total of 9,000 pounds arrived in Tulagi on 9 July 1917. Printed in London by Thomas de la Rue, and dated 18 December 1916, this initial shipment consisted of 2,000 5-shilling notes, 2,000 10-shilling notes, 5,000 1-pound notes, and 500 5-pound notes. The notes were delivered to the Currency Office on 14 July 1917 and issued two days later. The only 5-pound note was the one dated 18 December 1916. The 5-shilling note continued to be issued until 1926; the 10-shilling note until 1932; and the 1-pound note until 1933.

Transportation Sidi Kacem's small taxis have fixed tolls depending on from where you are going and your destination. Add 50% of the toll at night. Sidi Kacem is located along Morocco's national ONCF railway line and was considered a crossroads because passengers going to the North had to switch trains in its station. This is not longer the case as the ONCF has constructed a direct railway which doesn't cross Sidi Kacem.

A portion of the Navarre neighborhood is also included within the boundaries of the City Park / N. O. Museum Cultural District, designated by then Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu on November 1, 2008. History At the start of the 19th century what would become Navarre was mostly undeveloped swamp land a good distance from the developed parts of the young city along the Mississippi River. The narrow high ground alongside Bayou Metairie became a road, along the sides of which farmland was developed. The first of the area's important landmarks to be developed was Greenwood Cemetery, in 1852. The Canal Street, City Park, and Lake Pontchartrain Railway ran along one edge of the neighborhood on its way out alongside the Orleans Canal to Old Spanish Fort on Lake Pontchartrain. Otherwise, the land after a distance equivalent of a couple blocks back from Metairie Road was swamp. The 1880s and 1890s saw the first work at reclaiming the swampland in the area for development, and by the early 20th century the area back to Florida Avenue was largely drained. There was substantial development, mostly as white middle class residential single family homes, in the 1920s. The area in the back section of Navarre was the site of the United Fruit Company radio facilities, until it was redeveloped residentially in the 1940s. During World War II, the U.S. Navy LCVP's, or Higgins boats, were manufactured in the Navarre section of New Orleans.http://www.nola.com/175years/index.ssf/2011/11/1944_higgins_industries_in_new.html The foundation of the Higgins boat factory is still visible behind Delgado University.

They follow the exploits of Boston-born Confederate officer Nathaniel Starbuck. Four novels have been written, and the series is still unfinished due to Cornwell's commitment to other projects. However, he has stated on many occasions that he wishes to return to the character's story.BernardCornwell.net ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions The series presently includes the following novels: * Rebel (1993) * Copperhead (1994) * Battle Flag (1995) * The Bloody Ground (1996) Plot overview Rebel begins in Richmond, Virginia after the fall of Fort Sumter, Charleston, South Carolina when Starbuck is trying to visit his friend Adam Faulconer. Starbuck is saved from an attack by Richmond's residents who think that he is a Yankee spy by Faulconer's rich father Washington Faulconer. Faulconer wishes to raise a regiment to fight the Yankees, and he appoints Starbuck as one of his aides, with the rank of second lieutenant. Starbuck is there by circumstance, not for politics, and he is given the task of recruiting a tough Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War veteran named Thomas Truslow, who lives in the fictional Faulconer County. He succeeds by dedicating the grave of Truslow's wife and officiating in the marriage of his wayward daughter Sally Truslow. Many other events occur between this and the start of the hostilities, when the Faulconer Legion marches off to the First Battle of Bull Run. It is here that Starbuck alienates himself from Faulconer. Copperhead follows Starbuck during the period of the Union invasion of the Confederacy by the Army of the Potomac under General McClellan. Battle Flag is set during the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Bloody Ground follows Starbuck as the Confederate army under Robert E. Lee invades the North, culminating in the Battle of Antietam. Major characters *Nathaniel \\"Nate\\" Starbuck ‚Äì The main protagonist of the novels, Nate is a young Boston-born Yale theology undergraduate who finds himself in Richmond upon the outbreak of the civil war.

The novels describe him as squat, tough and bearded. *Sally Truslow ‚Äì The daughter of Thomas Truslow, who after the outbreak of war becomes a whore at Richmond's most exclusive establishment. She is described as not older than 16 in the first novel and of breathtaking beauty. *Adam Faulconer ‚Äì The son of Washington Faulconer and best friend of Nate Starbuck.

McClellan *Allan Pinkerton *Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Faulconer Legion The Faulconer Legion is a fictional regiment of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Confederate Army, the central unit of the Starbuck Chronicles. Shortly after the beginning of the war, Washington Faulconer is determined to set up a regiment free of state government control because he was unimpressed by Robert E. Lee and his lack of support. He returns from Richmond to find recruitment in full swing for the Legion; at least 10 companies have been recruited, along with a squadron of cavalry and two crews of artillery. Faulconer is the regiment's first colonel; his senior officers are Major Pelham, a veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and Major \\"Pecker\\" Bird, Faulconer's brother-in-law and a schoolmaster by profession. Major Danson is the Legion's initial surgeon and the local doctor. Faulconer leads an attack on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which fails. It is an unfortunate start to the war for Faulconer, and he shows a distinct lack of military judgment‚Äîalthough he thinks of himself as a competent soldier and tactician. =First Battle of Manassas= On the Fourth of July, the fully equipped Legion marches to Seven Springs to be sworn into the Confederate army. However Major Pelham suffers a heart attack and dies before the Legion leaves, a great blow to the men as Pelham was a popular leader. The Legion then marches to Roskill railhead. They bundle onto a train to Manassas and are assigned to Colonel Nathan Evans' brigade. But Faulconer does not trust Evans' military judgement and seeks out General P.G.T. Beauregard, to be moved closer to where he believes the action will be (on the Confederate right). Nathaniel Starbuck, whom Faulconer has dismissed and sent back to the Union lines, discovers advancing Union troops under David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman. He informs Evans of their positions, and the Legion, under the command of Major Bird, marches to repel the Federal attack. The regiment fights the advancing Union troops well, but Faulconer and his aide Ethan Ridley return and Faulconer is disgusted by the insubordination of Bird and Starbuck. In the renewed Union attack, Captain Adam Faulconer is wounded and the Legion collapses. Faulconer tries to rally them but is himself wounded. In the panic Truslow and Bird save the colours. After the battle, Faulconer claims that Starbuck killed Ethan Ridley, but this is put down to delirium; his claims are true however. An embittered and wounded Faulconer is promoted to brigadier general and Major Bird takes command of the Legion. =Ball's Bluff and Seven Pines= With Faulconer away in Richmond supposedly recovering from his wound, Bird makes Starbuck the captain in command of K Company, with Truslow as his sergeant. The Legion takes part in defeating the Union crossing at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, with Starbuck's company turning the northern flank. Adam, now a major on General Joseph E. Johnston's staff, is disgusted by the slaughter so begins feeding information on the Confederate defences to Starbuck's older brother James, a major in the Union army. Faulconer forms his own brigade and has the Legion attached to it, dismissing Starbuck. Having discovered Adam's betrayal, Starbuck crosses the lines posing as an ally of Adam to convince General George B. McClellan that the southern defences are stronger than they are. He then rejoins the southern army at the Battle of Seven Pines and takes part in Colonel Micah Jenkins breaking the first line of the northern position, although Adam has already sabotaged the attack by failing to pass on battle orders to General Benjamin Huger. He uses his knowledge of Adam's actions to force Faulconer to restore him to his company and Faulconer also reluctantly promotes Bird to lieutenant colonel. During the Battle of Gaines Mill, Adam deserts to the Union troops in full view of everyone. The Legion drive the northern forces from the ridge but suffer heavy casualties, reforming with eight companies of surviving troops. =Cedar Mountain and Second Battle of Manassas= General Faulconer appoints an alcoholic veteran and ex-slave merchant, Colonel Swynyard, as his second in command. At the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Colonel Bird is seriously wounded and command of the Legion devolves upon Major Hinton. The perfidious Swynyard is wounded by a passing cannonball and left on the field to die by Starbuck and Truslow. However, Swynyard's injury is not serious; it brings about a religious conversion in him, so he frees his slaves and gives up alcohol. He apologises to Starbuck for his behaviour toward him and promises to make things right. Meanwhile, Adam Falconer has joined a unit of Northern Cavalry, Galloway's horse, made up entirely of Southeners who know the terrain. Major Galloway has received funding from Starbuck's father the Reverend Dr Elial Starbuck, who in return asks the Major to get him a Confederate Battleflag. Adam leads a raid on his father's estate to obtain horses for his new command. To keep their promise to Dr Starbuck, Adam then attacks the Faulconer Brigade's encampment and manages to capture the Faulconer Legion battle flag and also steal the General's sabre, given to his grandfather by Lafayette. At the same time, the majority of the Legion's officers are celebrating Major Hinton's 50th birthday in a nearby tavern and are attacked there by a detachment of Galloway's horse led by the nefarious Captain William Blythe. In the ensuing chaos, the tavern is set on fire and almost all the officers killed. Faulconer is dismissed from command of the Brigade by General Jackson. Colonel Swynyard is appointed Brigade commander while Starbuck is promoted to Major and given command of the Legion. Truslow is made a captain in charge of Starbuck's old company. At the Second Battle of Manassas, Major Medlicott, who Faulconer attempted to make Legion commander ahead of Starbuck and who has command of the right hand wing, repeatedly refuses to fight until Starbuck kills him for refusing an order to advance. Galloway is killed when the horse are caught up in the flanking movement by Lee's reinforcements. In the aftermath, Starbuck burns Galloway's farm in retaliation for the burning of the tavern and recovers the battle flag from his father. =Harper's Ferry and Sharpsburg= Starbuck leads the Legion at the Battle of Chantilly, driving the last of John Pope's men out of Confederate territory, but Faulconer has obtained a position with the War Department and arranges to have Lieutenant Colonel Maitland placed in charge of the Legion while Starbuck is given command of a punishment battalion, the Yellowlegs. Starbuck manages to expose his superior, Colonel Holborow, as keeping the battalion away from the lines so he can sell their supplies on the black market and has the Yellowlegs transferred to Swynyard's brigade for the Maryland Campaign. The Legion stumble across Blythe, who fled the field at Manassass, and claims to be a Confederate officer, Captain Billy Tumlin, who was taken prisoner: He is made Starbuck's second-in-command. Meanwhile, Adam has been assigned as a courier by intelligence officer Colonel Thorne and collects a copy of Lee's battle plan which was left for him by Major Delaney. Adam is ambushed and killed by Southern horsemen but hides the order, which is later found by Northern troops. Starbuck leads the Yellowlegs to clear the ridge at the Battle of Harpers Ferry but the nervous Maitland keeps the Legion back. At the Battle of Sharpsburg, Swynward's brigade is decimated by Hooker's repeated attacks but manages to stand their ground, with Maitland drinking heavily to make it through the battle. Blythe flees back to Northern lines after manipulating Captain Dennison and Sergeant Case into trying to kill Starbuck; the attempt fails and Starbuck turns a cannon on them in retaliation. As the Confederates prepare to withdraw, Maitland is sent back to a staff position in Richmond, Starbuck is given command of the surviving members of both the Legion and the Yellowlegs, and Swynyard is promoted to brigadier general. =Colors= The colours of the Faulconer Legion are composed of the Confederate Battle Flag and the Faulconer coat of arms with the motto \\"Forever Ardent\\". They are six feet by six as opposed to the four feet advocated by the War Department. Tie-ins to other Cornwell books In the second book of the Starbuck series, Copperhead, Starbuck encounters Patrick Lassan, Chasseur Colonel of the French Imperial Guard, and French Military Observer attached to the Union Army. The son of an English father and a French mother, he uses his mother's last name ‚Äì Lassan ‚Äì because his parents never married. It is ultimately revealed that Lassan is the son of Richard Sharpe. His sword, described as an oversized steel-hilted straight sword, is likely the same 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword carried by his father throughout the earlier Peninsular War.

Charles died in battle, less than a year after they were married and only one month before their daughter, Carlotta, was born. =Progressive leader= A young widow, Josephine moved back to Staten Island with Carlotta, and lived with her parents. After her father's death, she lived with her mother and daughter in New York City. She became a businesswoman and a reformer. Josephine was active in the Anti-Imperialist League where she met other prominent Progressives. She served as Vice-President of the League from 1901-1905 and was a great advocate of Philippine independence. Josephine Shaw Lowell Josephine was committed to social justice and reform and seized the opportunity to become involved in Progressive reform and the eradication of poverty. She once said, \\"If the working people had all they ought to have, we should not have the paupers and criminals. It is better to save them before they go under, than to spend your life fishing them out afterward.\\" Josephine viewed the very poor as \\"worthless men and women\\" who were \\"vicious and idle\\" individuals that needed to \\"learn to enjoy work.\\" She proposed imprisoning \\"all women under thirty who had been arrested for misdemeanors or who had produced two illegitimate children.\\" She blamed New Yorker's who gave to the poor for the death of a baby who was living on the streets with her poor mother during a cold winter. She believed that the very poor should be \\"committed, until reformed, to district work-houses, there to be kept at hard- labor, and educated morally and mentally.\\" Wallace, Mike (1999). Gotham, A History of New York City to 1898. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1032. In 1876, Governor Samuel Tilden of New York State appointed Josephine to Commissioner of the New York State Board of Charities. She was the first woman to ever hold this position. She served actively on the Board until 1889. Josephine Shaw Lowell and the State Board of Charities established the New York State Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women in 1878. The asylum was a response to public concerns that 'feeble-minded' women needed to be housed in a specialized facility. In several reports before the state legislature, Lowell stated that feeble-minded women disregarded moral and sexual restraint when placed in the undisciplined environment of an almshouse and frequently had illegitimate children who, in turn, became dependent on the state for their welfare. Women of child-bearing age, fifteen to forty-five, were admitted into this institution, in order to \\"prevent them from multiplying their kind\\" (New York State Board of Charities Report, 1879). Lowell described these women as \\"promiscuous and criminalistic\\" carriers of a \\"deadly poison\\" which reproduced through successive generations, and charities must not allow \\"men and women who are diseased and vicious to reproduce their kind.\\" Established in Newark, NY, by Josephine Shaw Lowell and the State Board of Charities (1878) Throughout her lifetime, she also founded many charitable organizations including: the New York Charity Organization in 1882, the House of Refuge for Women (later known as the New York Training School for Girls) in 1886, the Woman's Municipal League in 1894, and the Civil Service Reform Association of New York State in 1895. =Later life and death= Josephine Shaw Lowell in 1899 (from a Bas-Relief by Augustus Saint-Gaudens) Perhaps her most wide-ranging and effective organization was the New York Consumers' League which she established in 1890. This organization strove to improve the wages and the working conditions of women workers in New York City. The League was particularly concerned with retail clerks. Josephine published a \\"White List\\" that contained a list of stores known to treat women workers well. Initially, the list was very short. The New York Consumer's League was adopted in many other cities as chapters opened across the country. The umbrella organization, the National Consumers League (NCL), became a powerful lobbying group. Grave of Josephine Shaw Lowell and her husband Charles Russell Lowell at Mount Auburn Cemetery She died of cancer in 1905, at her home in New York City, and is buried with her husband at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain in Bryant Park, which is behind the New York Public Library Main Branch building, was dedicated in 1912. The fountain is reportedly New York City's first public memorial dedicated to a woman. Publications *Public Relief and Private Charity (1884). *Industrial Arbitration and Conciliation (1893).

Life and career Jean- Jacques Burnel was born in Notting Hill, London, to French parents. As a child, as the son of French immigrants, he was often the victim of mockery from his schoolmates, which later led him to call himself John to disguise his French origins. This early encounter with xenophobia would also have an impact on his explosive temper in life and on stage as well as on the way he plays. He moved with his parents to Godalming, Surrey, when he was 12 years old and attended the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, subsequently reading history at the University of Bradford and Huddersfield Polytechnic.Buckley 1997, pp.16‚Äì18. Burnel originally trained as a classical guitarist, but adopted the bass guitar as his instrument within The Stranglers.Buckley 1997, p.17. He has provided lead vocals on nearly a third of the band's songs, though Burnel later explained he often sang lyrics written by Hugh Cornwell (or vice versa) depending on \\"who had the best voice for that particular song.\\" Burnel has been a member of the Stranglers since the group's inception in 1974, but has also made two solo albums: Euroman Cometh in 1979, and Un Jour Parfait in 1988, as well as a collaborative album with fellow Stranglers member Dave Greenfield, Fire and Water (Ecoutez Vos Murs) in 1983.Buckley 1997, pp.136‚Äì137. Burnel has also produced and appeared as a guest musician for a number of artists, such as Lizard and ARB from Japan, Polyphonic Size (from Belgium) and Taxi Girl's album Seppuku in 1981, as well as Laurent Sinclair's \\"Devant le Miroir\\" maxi single. Burnel also formed a rhythm and blues covers band, the Purple Helmets, who played a number of concerts and released two albums in the late 1980s. As a French citizen, Burnel received his call-up papers for national service in France. He succeeded in avoiding it with a novel defence, arguing that his absence would indirectly damage the Stranglers as a band, and therefore the careers of the other members. This was in accordance with Burnel's claim that only the \\"bourgeois\\" would ever agree to serve their country's military. Burnel composed and performed music for the anime Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, including both the opening and ending themes, \\"We Were Lovers\\", and \\"You Won't See Me Coming\\" respectively. Burnel is fluent in French and writes many of his songs in the language. Equipment and sound Shuker JJ Burnel signature bass headstock Burnel is noted for his distinctive bass guitar sound and melodic bass lines. These are particularly prominent on earlier Stranglers recordings produced by Martin Rushent, such as the hit singles \\"No More Heroes\\" and \\"Peaches\\". In the early days, Burnel's distinctive aggressive sound was created using a Fender Precision Bass with RotoSound roundwound strings played with a plectrum very close to the bridge, through Hiwatt all-valve amplification.Buckley 1997, p. 90. However, the defining factor was the use of a Marshall 4x12 speaker cabinet in which the speaker cones were ripped, creating a distorted sound.Hugh Cornwell, The Stranglers Song by Song, Later, he used a Yamaha BB2000, a Steinberger L2 (headless), and a Kinkade acoustic bass. He currently plays Shuker JJ Burnel signature basses custom-built in England by Jon Shuker.Shuker Guitars,\\"Players\\", Shuker, 2017. Retrieved 14 June 2018. He was one of the first bass guitarists to use Trace Elliot amplification when the company began production in 1980. He now uses amplification by Ashdown Engineering who have honoured him with his own JJ500 signature amps.Ashdown Engineering, \\"Jean-Jacques Burnel\\", Ashdown, 2018. Retrieved 14 June 2018. Personal life As of 2015, Burnel was a 7th degree black belt (nanadan) in Shidokan Karate and is head of Shidokan UK. He is also a motorcyclist and has owned many Triumph motorbikes.Buckley 1997, p.18.

The tractor was developed by the design bureau of Witold Jakusz of the PZIn≈º company between 1931 and 1934. In 1931 Poland bought several dozens of British Vickers E tanks and a license to build additional tanks at home. The Polish Army also considered purchase of the then-constructed Dragon Medium Mk IV artillery tractor, based on the Vickers E, but the purchase never happened. As the British tank was considered not suited for service in the Polish climate and needed adaptation, it was decided that a similar Polish tank be built as a modification of the Vickers design. The tank, initially code-named VAU-33, in time became the 7TP. Simultaneously, work started on a new artillery tractor for the Polish Army that was to replace the Citro√´n-Kegresse tractors built in France in the early 1920s. The main advantage of the new model of artillery tractor, dubbed C6P, C6T and finally C7TP was to be its low price, ease of manufacture and durability. For that purpose, the C7P shared many parts with the 7TP light tank, produced simultaneously. In fact the chassis was almost a direct copy of the tank, while the superstructure was partially borrowed from a license-built Saurer bus. C6T Prototype In 1933 the first two prototypes were constructed in the Ursus factory of the PZIn≈º. The C6P had the engine placed in the front and used front wheel drive, while the C6T had the engine placed behind the crew compartment and used rear wheel drive. After a series of tests the C6P was chosen as a better option. In fact the new tractor, later redesignated as C7P, was much superior to its contemporary counterparts, particularly the British Dragon Medium Mk IV and the Soviet T-26T, both in terms of power and additional equipment. The final project included a closed crew compartment and a motor-driven winch. In 1934 production started. Out of approximately 350 ordered, only 151 were built by the outbreak of World War II. Approximately 108 were deployed to the artillery units, where the C7P was used as an artillery tractor in the regiments of heaviest artillery, mainly for towing of heavy 220 mm wz.32 ≈†koda mortars. An additional 18 tractors were attached to various tank units, mostly the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade for towing of immobilized tanks and for transport of tanks to the battlefield on specially designed towing platforms. Finally, two tractors were delivered to the engineering units for road maintenance and destruction of railways in case of a war. Until 1942 an additional 52 were to be delivered to various communal services, where they were to be used as snowplows to keep the roads in good condition in case of a war. During the Invasion of Poland of 1939 all C7P were used in active service. Most were captured by the Germans and were used as towing machines and snowplows at least until 1941. No example of the C7P survives today. However, a single C7P hull was recovered near Volgograd in around 2001. This hull was restored with a BT-5 or BT-7 turret and now looks like a T-26 tank.

Pre-Bolivarian Revolution =1970s= Venezuelan state governments operated only five facilities in 1979, down from about sixty hospitals in 1970 since the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MSAS) took over many of the hospitals. In 1978, a presidential election year, medical sales in Venezuela hit an all-time high, but dropped in 1979. In 1979, there were approximately 250 hospitals in Venezuela with MSAS operating the majority of them (58%). Venezuela had a shortage of medical professionals and hospital beds in the late 1970s due to a large increase in the population and a lack of specialization among health care professionals. The lack of both professionals and beds was higher in the rural areas compared to the more populated, urban areas. Between 1978 and 1980, Venezuela had 14,771 doctors, 8,805 nurses and 2,804 nursing auxiliaries. =1980s= Under President Luis Herrera Campins's Sixth National Plan, the government planned to increase medical funding by 9.7% annually between 1981 and 1985, with medical expenditures planned to reach $2.1 billion in 1985. $1.2 billion were designated to the construction of new facilities to combat bed shortages, with a main focus on establishing clinics in order to avoid the inefficiency of larger hospitals. The rehabilitation of handicapped individuals and a focus on addressing heart disease (the leading cause of death in Venezuela) were also highlighted in the Sixth National Plan. Medical professionals in Venezuela were \\"extremely U.S. oriented\\", with most doctors attending post-graduate work in the United States. These doctors were able to speak English, read U.S. medical journals, and attended gatherings of United States medical experts. In 1981, over 70% of health care services were administered by the government. =1990s= Foreign medical equipment developed abroad was quickly adopted and shipped to Venezuela with most of the country's medical goods needing to be imported. In 1980, Venezuela imported 47% of its medical goods from the United States, 13% from Germany, 8% from Japan, and 3% from the United Kingdom. The majority of the medical equipment was distributed by a conglomerate of about 45 distributors known as the Asociaci√≥n Venezolana de Distribuidores de Equipos Medicos (AVEDEM), while 15% of medical products were distributed by smaller entities. From 1992 to 1993, there was a cholera epidemic in the Orinoco Delta and Venezuela's political leaders were accused of racial profiling of their own indigenous people to deflect blame from the country's institutions, thereby aggravating the epidemic.Briggs, Charles L. Stories in the time of cholera: Racial profiling during a medical nightmare. Univ of California Press, 2003 pp.3-5 During the 1990s, the mortality rate was 318 per 100,000 population for diseases of the [cardiac system], 156 for cancers, 634 for external causes (including drowning, self-harm, violence, falls, road accidents etc., 1126 for communicable diseases such as chest infections, syphilis, meningitis, and 654 for certain conditions originating before birth.GBD Profile Venezuela http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/country_profiles/GBD/ihme_gbd_country_report_venezuela.pdf Bolivarian Revolution Following the Bolivarian Revolution and the establishment of the Bolivarian government, improvements in healthcare were promising due to the installation of free healthcare facilities and programs, and the assistance of Cuban medical professionals. The Bolivarian government's failure to concentrate on healthcare, the reduction of healthcare spending, and government corruption eventually affected medical practices in Venezuela causing avoidable deaths along with an emigration of medical professionals to other countries. Venezuela's reliance on imported goods and its complicated exchange rates (initiated by Hugo Ch√°vez) led to increasing shortages during the late-2000s and into the 2010s that affected the availability of medicines and medical equipment in the country. =2000s= Healthcare spending by percentage of Venezuela's GDP. Source: World Bank Several transmissible diseases, including dengue fever, malaria, measles, and tuberculosis, reappeared in Venezuela. In 1999 an estimated 62,000 Venezuelans were living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); and in 2001 an estimated 2,000 people died from AIDS. At the end of 2003, the percentage of the population between the ages of 15 to 49 with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS was 0.7. In 2000, 85% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population had access to improved water. Improved sanitation was available to 71% of the urban population and 48% of the rural population. In August 2001, President Hugo Ch√°vez announced a national campaign to fight the dengue fever epidemic that had infected 24,000 and killed four. Child immunization for measles in 2002 (as a percentage of under 12 months) dropped to 78%, compared with 84% in 1999. Throughout Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency, the Health Ministry changed ministers multiple times. According to a high-ranking official of Venezuela's Health Ministry, the ministers were treated as scapegoats whenever issues with Venezuela's public health arose. The official also detailed ways Health Ministry officials would perform illicit acts in order to enrich themselves by selling goods designated for public healthcare. =2010s= The Venezuelan government stopped publishing medical statistics in 2010. In 2014 when Venezuela's economy was facing difficulties, Venezuela's healthcare system deteriorated. In August 2014, Venezuela was the only country in Latin America where the incidence of malaria was increasing. Venezuela registered the highest number of cases of malaria in the past 50 years, with 300 of 100,000 Venezuelans being infected with the disease. Medical shortages in the country also hampered the treatment of Venezuelans. Shortages of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS affected about 50,000 Venezuelans, potentially causing thousands of Venezuelans with HIV to develop AIDS. Venezuelans also stated that due to shortages of medicines, it was hard to find acetaminophen to help alleviate the newly introduced chikungunya virus, a potentially lethal mosquito-borne disease. In September 2014, Health Minister Nancy P√©rez admitted that there were 45,745 cases of dengue fever. There were also contested estimates involving the number of Venezuelans infected with chikungunya. In September 2014, the Venezuelan government stated that only 400 Venezuelans were infected with chikungunya while the Central University of Venezuela stated that there could be between 65,000 and 117,000 Venezuelans infected. In August 2015 independent health monitors said that there were more than two million people infected with chikungunya while the government said there were 36,000 cases. In October 2014, President Maduro announced a plan to create the University of Science and Health and called for a meeting of ALBA in order to discuss the combat against the Ebola virus disease due to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Into the Maduro presidency, the government could not supply enough money for medical supplies among healthcare providers, with doctors saying that 9 of 10 large hospitals had only 7% of required supplies and private doctors reporting numbers of patients that are \\"impossible\\" to count dying from easily treated illnesses due to the \\"downward sliding economy\\" in 2014. Many Venezuelans died avoidable deaths with medical professionals having scarce resources and using methods that were replaced decades ago. In February 2014, doctors at University of Caracas Medical Hospital stopped performing surgeries due to the lack of supplies, even though nearly 3,000 people required surgery. In March 2014, the executive director of the Venezuelan Association of Hospitals and Clinics explained how in less than a month, shortages of 53 medical products rose to 109 and explained how the CADIVI system is to blame since 86% of supplies are imported with private sector hospitals claiming they owe suppliers billions of dollars in order to pay their debts. protesting in 2017 for medicine due to the shortages in Venezuela In early 2015, only 35% of hospital beds were available and 50% of operating rooms could not function due to the lack of resources. In March 2015, a Venezuelan NGO, Red de M√©dicos por la Salud, reported that there was a 68% shortage of surgical supplies and a 70% shortage of medicines in Venezuelan pharmacies. In May 2015, the Venezuelan Medical Federation said that 15,000 doctors had left the public health care system due to drug and equipment shortages and poor pay. In August 2015 the Human Rights Watch said, ‚ÄúWe have rarely seen access to essential medicines deteriorate as quickly as it has in Venezuela except in war zones.‚Äù By the end of 2015, the Bolivarian government reported that of all Venezuelans visiting public hospitals that year, one in three patients died. Also in 2015, 30% of all reported malaria cases in the Americas were in Venezuela (more than Brazil, which has a much larger population). In 2016, according to the Venezuelan government, 240,000 cases of malaria were reported, rising 76% in a year. According to former Venezuelan health minister Jos√© F√©lix Oletta, more than 500,000 Venezuelans would contract malaria in 2017. A study of 6,500 households by three of the main universities in Venezuela found that \\"74% of the population had lost on average nineteen pounds in 2016\\".* In April 2017 Venezuela's health ministry reported that maternal mortality jumped by 65% in 2016 and that the number of infant deaths rose by 30%. It also said that the number of cases of malaria was up by 76%. Shortly after Minister of Health Antonieta Caporale released in 2017 this data, and health statistics showing increases in 2016 infant and maternal mortality and infectious diseases, Maduro fired her and replaced the physician with a pharmacist close to vice-president Tareck El Aissami, Luis L√≥pez Chejade. Also available in Spanish. The publications were removed from the Ministry's website, and no further health data has been made available, although the government had produced health bulletins for several decades.. https://www.economist.com/news/world-week/21721971-politics-week The ministry had not reported health data in two years, and none has been reported since. In November 2017 the Venezuelan Society of Public Health informed that a total of 857 cases of measles, from which 465 have been confirmed, had been registered. The Pan American Health Organization reported that at least 71% of the reported cases of measles in 2017 have occurred in Venezuela. In 2018 Venezuela continued to suffer acute shortages of food and medicines. In March 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that the \\"collapse of Venezuela's health system, once one of the best in Latin America, has led to a surge in infant and maternal mortality rates and a return of rare diseases that were considered all but eradicated. In March 2019, Red Cross officials was reported that the \\"collapse\\" of the health system had caused the return of old and eradicated rare diseases like yellow fever, dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis, as well as a large increase in infant and maternal mortality rates. There was a concern that untreated migrants would begin to spread diseases to other countries. Also available online. The United Nations estimated in 2019 that 2.8 million Venezuelans have healthcare needs, 300,000 are at risk of dying with cancer, diabetes or HIV as they have not had access to medicine for more than a year, and preventable diseases like diphtheria, malaria, measles and tuberculosis are rising in 2019, along with hepatitis A, because of sanitation and lack of access to water. The April 2019 HRW/Johns Hopkins report showed this rise in infectious and preventable diseases, as well as increasing malnutrition, infant and maternal death, and undertreatment of HIV. Inflation and medicine shortages have meant that patients are asked to bring their own food, water and soap, and medical supplies including scalpels and syringes. = 2020 = Venezuela was affected by COVID-19 pandemic on 13 March 2020. State and private In 2008, private hospitals and clinics and the qualifications of their medical personnel were comparable to U.S. standards. Private health services were costly and overly full. The Venezuelan government accused private hospitals of profiteering. Two thousand doctors left the country between 2006 and 2008. A leading factor of this is the pitiful salaries of Venezuelan doctors. A typical doctor in Venezuela earns just $6.00 per month, amidst their current economic crisis.https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/09/06/757822363/a-doctor- or-nurse-might-earn-6-a-month-in-venezuela-if-theyre-lucky  See also  *Health in Venezuela *Mission Barrio Adentro *Operaci√≥n Milagro  References  Ven ","title":"Health care in Venezuela"},{"id":"3877631","text":"The Liberation Class was a class of 2-8-0 steam locomotives designed for heavy freight work in post-Second World War Europe. 120 were built by the Vulcan Foundry of Newton-le-Willows in 1946.

One of two theatres (the other being the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville) built on the site of a ch√¢telet, a small castle or fortress, it was designed by Gabriel Davioud at the request of Baron Haussmann between 1860 and 1862. Originally named the Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial du Ch√¢telet, it has undergone remodeling and name changes over the years. Currently it seats 2,500 people. Description The theatre is one of two apparent twins constructed along the quays of the Seine, facing each other across the open Place du Ch√¢telet. The other is the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville. Their external architecture is essentially Palladian entrances under arcades, although their interior layouts differ considerably. At the centre of the plaza is an ornate, sphinx-endowed fountain, erected in 1808, which commemorates Napoleon's victory in Egypt.  Origins  The theatre 1875 The Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial du Ch√¢telet was built for Hippolyte Hostein's equestrian company, the Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial du Cirque, whose previous theatre, the Cirque Olympique on the Boulevard du Temple, was slated for demolition by Baron Haussmann to allow the construction of the Boulevard du Prince-Eug√®ne (now the Boulevard Voltaire).Wild 1989, p. 76. The site for the new theatre was acquired by the City of Paris in October 1859, and construction took place between 1860 and 1862. The interior designers included Eug√®ne Carri√®res and Armand Cambon, and the curtain was created by Charles Cambon. The theatre originally seated 2,200 people, although Haussmann claimed it held 3,600.According to a document in the Archives Nationales, the theatre seated 2,200 (Wild 1989, p. 76). The repertory, fixed by a decree of 20 September 1862, included military works and f√©eries in one or several acts, as well as dramas and vaudevilles.Wild 1989, p. 77. Hostein left as director in September 1868. Nestor Roqueplan ran the theatre from 1 July 1869 to April 1870. Fall of the Second Empire The theatre was closed from September 1870 to July 1871 due to the Franco-Prussian War. The war brought about the fall of the Second French Empire, and under the succeeding French Third Republic, the appellation imp√©rial was dropped. Hippolyte Hostein returned as the theatre's director in 1873‚Äì1874. Notably, beginning in April 1876, the stage version of Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days, adapted by Verne and Adolphe d'Ennery, began a run spanning sixty-four years and 2,195 performances (although not continuously). It was only the Nazi occupation of Paris in May 1940 that closed this production permanently.History of the production on anao.pagesperso-orange.fr Into the 20th Century, the theatre was used for operettas, variety and ballet performances, for classical and popular music concerts. It was also, for a time, a cinema. Claude Debussy's Le Martyre de saint S√©bastien received its premiere in the theatre on 22 May 1911. It was the first venue for the Ballets Russes, before they moved to the new th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es with their 1913 season: among the ballets premiered at the Ch√¢telet are Igor Stravinsky's Petrushka on 13 June 1911, Paul Dukas' La P√©ri on 22 April 1912, Vaslav Nijinsky's Afternoon of a Faun on 29 May 1912, Maurice Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√© on 8 June 1912, and Erik Satie and Jean Cocteau's Parade on 18 May 1917. In addition, many foreign composers and conductors made appearances in the theatre, including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss.  Recent history  Since 1979, it has been operated by the City of Paris, and, after undergoing a major restoration, re-opened under the name of Th√©√¢tre Musical de Paris in 1980. It was acoustically re-modeled again in 1989 and reverted to the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet name. Shirley Horn recorded her 1992 live album I Love You, Paris at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet. For a time it was mainly used for opera performances and concerts. The Orchestre de Paris and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France have played there. In 1993 the Philharmonia Orchestra of London began an annual residency period. Under the direction of St√©phane Lissner for four years from 1995, the theatre received additional improvements in acoustics and sightlines. In 2004, became artistic director of the theatre. He de-emphasized classical music and dance performances and introduced more lucrative productions of Broadway musicals, including Kiss Me, Kate, Singin' in the Rain, 42nd Street, and An American in Paris. In 2017, Choplin was succeeded by Ruth Mackenzie, who was appointed artistic director alongside general director Thomas Lauriot dit Pr√©vost, who worked at the theatre with Choplin from 2006 to 2013.Roslyn Sulcas, \\"Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris Gets Its First Female Artistic Director\\", The New York Times, 4 January 2017. Mackenzie aimed to connect the theatre's programming more to the citizens of Paris, including its banlieues. Under her tenure, from 2017 to 2019, the theatre was closed for a major renovation. When the theatre re-opened in 2019, Mackenzie and Lauriot dit Pr√©vost introduced a ‚ÄúRobin Hood scheme‚Äù for theatregoers and sponsors to buy extra tickets for those who cannot afford them. In 2019, Comme des Gar√ßons launched a fragrance called \\"Odeur Du Th√©√¢tre Du Ch√¢telet Acte I\\" created by Caroline Dumur inspired by the history of the theatre mixed with the modernity of its new creative director Ruth Mackenzie. On 28 August 2020 it was announced that Th√©√¢tre Du Ch√¢telet had fired Ruth Mackenzie as artistic director, with an unnamed source suggesting a managerial problem with the staff and a financial problem due to an insufficient artistic season. In response, Mackenzie confirmed an inquiry into her performance had been carried out, but stated that it had not uncovered evidence of wrongdoing. Notes Bibliography *Allison, John, ed.(2003).

Fort La Reine was built in 1738 and is one of the forts of the western expansion directed by Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La V√©rendrye, first military commander in the west of what is now known as Canada. Located on the Assiniboine River where present day Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, stands, the fort served as a fur trading post. It was also the base of operations for much exploration north and west. From Fort La Reine, explorers made their way to Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan River. Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V√©rendrye, the youngest La V√©rendrye son, led expeditions from Fort La Reine and built the following western installations in what is now Manitoba: Fort Dauphin, Fort Bourbon, and Fort Paskoya. In 1743, the fort was also the starting point for an exploration of the upper Missouri River as far as the Yellowstone River. One old source says that the fort was burnt to the ground by the Assiniboines after the French had left it in 1752.George Bryce, \\"The Assiniboine River and its Forts\\", Trans. Roy. Soc. Canada, Section II, 1892 Fort La Reine is near the portage from the Assiniboine north to Lake Manitoba. The elder Verendrye left Fort Maurepas at the mouth of the Red River in September 1738, ascended that river to the present site of Winnipeg, ascended the Assiniboine and on October 3 chose a site for Fort La Reine. MortonArthur Morton, \\"A History of Western Canada\\", circa 1936, page 190 thinks the site was about 21 miles east of Portage la Prairie and two miles southeast of Poplar Point. He thinks the fort was moved west to Portage la Prairie the following summer. In 1738 Fort Rouge (fortification) was built at the present site of Winnipeg. Fort La Reine was the base for the elder Verendrye's journey to the Mandans in North Dakota (October 1738 to January 1739). In 1742-43 it was the base for the Verendrye Brothers' journey to the Rocky Mountains. It became increasing clear that neither the Assiniboine nor the Missouri was the route to the west and French attention shifted north to the Saskatchewan River. The first priest to travel this far west arrived at the fort in 1743. He was a Jesuit named Claude-Godefroy Coquart. Around 1770, when trade was re-established, Adhemar's Fort and Blondishe's Fort were in the area. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1925.  Fort la Reine Museum  Today there is a museum named after the original fort located in Portage la Prairie, MB. There is a replica of Fort la Reine on the Museum in addition numerous other buildings covering local history from the time of La V√©rendrye to current day. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

Started in 1968 and running approximately annually since then, it is one of the oldest science fiction conventions in the midwest United States. It is run by the Minnesota Science Fiction Society, a non- profit organization that is \\"dedicated to furthering the appreciation of science fiction and fantasy literature\\". Minicon has had many guests of honor over the years, including Gordon R. Dickson, Poul Anderson, Clifford D. Simak, Lester del Rey, Frederik Pohl, Octavia E. Butler, Harlan Ellison, Larry Niven, and Terry Pratchett.  Features  Staples of modern Minicons are: * Several tracks of panel discussions * Readings * Gaming, formal and informal * The Bozo Bus Tribune, convention newsletter * Art show * Dealers room * Kids' programming * Science room * Filk and folk music * Consuite and bar * Parties  History  The first Minicon was held on 6 January 1968 in Coffman Union at the University of Minnesota and had approximately 60 attendees. In all subsequent years it was held in area hotels. Attendance grew fairly steadily for many years, culminating in a series of conventions that drew over 3000 people and used as many as 4 hotels. However, in 1999, Minicon downscaled dramatically due to a feeling among some organizers that it had strayed too far from its roots and had become unmanageable. Recent Minicons have had between 400 and 700 attendees. Around the time that Minicon reduced its size, some other conventions sprang up in the area, including CONvergence and MarsCon. Minicon should not be confused with MinnCon, a dark fantasy/horror convention founded in 1971 by fans living in St. Paul, Minnesota. MinnCon changed its name to Arcana in 1988 to avoid confusion but many area fans still refer to the convention by its older name. The term \\"minicon\\" is often used informally in science fiction circles for any small convention.  Latest convention  Minicon 50 was held April 2‚Äì5, 2015 at the DoubleTree Bloomington Hotel in Bloomington, Minnesota. The guests of honor scheduled were authors Jane Yolen, Larry Niven and Brandon Sanderson; publisher Tom Doherty; musician Adam Stemple and artist Michael Whelan.

The company was started by Swedish-born pilot and aeronautical designer Per Lindstrand in Oswestry, England, as Colt Balloons (later Thunder & Colt Balloons, then Lindstrand Balloons) in 1978. Lindstrand Balloons was known for its leading-edge engineering, which included sophisticated testing and production facilities. Lindstrand Balloons designed and built the hot air balloons flown by Per Lindstrand and Richard Branson on their record breaking flights; first across the Atlantic Ocean in 1987 and then the Pacific Ocean in 1990. Subsequently Lindstrand designed and built three Rozi√®re balloons which Per Lindstrand and Branson and others used in their unsuccessful attempts to circumnavigate the Earth by balloon. Per Lindstrand played an instrumental role in making these flights possible, and was pilot for all of them. Ownership structure In the late-1990s, Cameron Holdings and its owner Don Cameron acquired two-thirds ownership of Lindstrand Balloons. Cameron bought the majority stake in Lindstrand Balloons from Rory McCarthy, a British industrialist associated with Richard Branson, who had invested in Lindstrand to support Branson's series of record-setting balloon flights. The remaining third of the company was owned by its founder Per Lindstrand, until 2003 when Per sold his remaining share to Cameron Holdings. Despite Cameron's ownership, Lindstrand Balloons continued to operate as an independent company with separate management and its own distinct designs and products. Lindstrand Technologies Per Lindstrand independently operates a separate company, which designs and builds gas balloons, innovative buildings, specialized aerospace equipment (including an advanced parachute for the Beagle 2 Mars-lander) and cutting edge inflatable structures including aircraft hangars, plugs for fire-containment for road tunnels and flood prevention systems. On April 15, 2015 it was reported that Lindstrand Balloons had closed, with 19 workers losing their jobs, citing the strength of the pound and terrorism threats in the Middle East as factors in the slow sales of balloons.

It was divided into 100 centimes (ÿµŸÜÿ™ŸäŸÖ) and was equivalent to the French franc. History The franc replaced the rial in 1891 at the rate of 1 rial = 60 centimes. It consisted of both coins and banknotes produced specifically for Tunisia, although early banknotes were Algerian issues overstamped with \\"Tunisie\\". The franc was replaced in 1960 by the dinar at a rate of 1000 francs = 1 dinar, the dinar having been established as the unit of account in 1958. Coins The first coins denominated in francs were issued in 1887, before the franc became the currency of Tunisia. These were gold 25 rial coins which were also marked \\"15 F\\" to indicate their value in French francs. In 1891, bronze 1, 2, 5 and 10 centimes, silver 50 centimes, 1 and 2 francs, and gold 10 and 20 francs were introduced, all equal in size and composition to the corresponding French coins. The 1 and 2 centimes were only issued that year. In 1918, holed, nickel-bronze 5, 10 and 25 centimes were introduced, followed, in 1921, by aluminium-bronze 50 centimes, 1 and 2 francs and silver 10 and 20 francs in 1930. Again, these coins matched the French coins in size and composition. However, in 1934, silver 5 francs coins were introduced, despite the French 5 francs being made of nickel. As in France, zinc 10 and 20 centimes coins were introduced during the Second World War with silver coins discontinued. Production of coins below 5 francs ceased in 1945, with an aluminium-bronze 5 francs introduced in 1946, followed by cupro-nickel 20, 50 and 100 francs in 1950 and a cupro-nickel 5 francs in 1954. These four cupro- nickel coins were last struck in 1957. Banknotes In 1903, the Banque de l'Alg√©rie introduced 5 franc notes with the overprint \\"Tunisie\\". These were followed by 500 francs in 1904, 20, 50 and 10 francs in 1908 and 1000 franc notes in 1918. Between 1918 and 1921, the \\"Regence de Tunis\\" issued notes for 50 centimes, 1 and 2 francs. The bank introduced 5000 franc notes in 1942, whilst the \\"Direction des Finance\\" issued 50 centime, 1 and 2 franc notes in 1943. The last 5 franc notes were issued in 1944. In 1946, the name of the bank changed to the Banque de l'Alg√©rie et de la Tunisie. Notes were issued for Tunisia in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 francs, with the 20, 50 and 100 franc notes being replaced by coins in 1950.

They are sometimes referred to as the little C class or the original C class to distinguish them from the C class of 1930. Introduction With the construction of a national network under Julius Vogel's \\"Great Public Works\\" scheme came the requirement of motive power. Train sizes at the time were small and the terrain was difficult, so the C class was ordered, ten from Neilson and Company and six from D√ºbs and Company. The initial duties were to aid in the construction of lines, where the wheel arrangement of 0-4-0 and the light-weight were a particular asset. Once main lines were open, the class was utilized to haul general freight and passenger trains, but it was quickly superseded by new locomotives that were larger and more powerful, with greater coal and water capacity. The class was found to be unstable at speeds higher than , and by 1880 all had been converted to 0-4-2 wheel arrangement. Numbering The class was numbered between C 1 and C 577. Numbering was often illogical and locomotives changed numbers multiple times, partly because the railway network consisted of many isolated sections using different numbering schemes. As the class was used all around the country, from the Kumeu-Riverhead Section north of Auckland to the under-construction Seddonville Branch in Westland, they acquired a range of numbers. Sometimes a locomotive on one section would have the same number as a locomotive on another, or when a locomotive was transferred to a new section it received a new number in line with that section's numbering scheme. When standard nationwide numbering was introduced, numbers were modified again. Withdrawal and preservation By the commencement of the 20th century, some of the class, too small for the national network, had been sold to operators of private industrial lines. By the early 1920s all had been sold, and many gave decades of good service on industrial lines and bush tramways. Their small size was a considerable asset and C 132 survived long enough to be saved for preservation. It operated on the Silver Stream Railway until December 2008 when it was taken out of service for a major overhaul. Another C was recovered in 1993 from where it had been dumped in the Buller Gorge, Westland and is with the Westport Railway Preservation Society, whose goal is to return it to operating condition.

It premiered on 28 February 2000 and ran for six episodes, ending on 15 March 2000. The principal writers were David Mitchell and Robert Webb. Additional writers included Richard Ayoade and Ricky Gervais. The BBC writes, \\"And if the series itself is not widely remembered, it's notable not least for bringing together an immensely talented group of young performers who have since joined the 'A' list of British comedians.\\" Cast members included Olivia Colman, David Mitchell, Robert Webb, Martin Freeman, Matthew Holness and Charlotte Hudson. Due to much of the cast's later popularity, the show has achieved cult status. Sketches * Two writers (Webb and Colman) pitch surreal ideas for television shows to Alan Titchmarsh's agent (Mitchell). *Outdoor Wee: Television host Keith (Holness) interviews celebrities one-on-one (played by Mitchell, Webb, Colman, and Freeman) whilst the two urinate outdoors at a unique location around Britain, on a TV programme called \\"Outdoor Wee\\". *I'm Not A...: A hapless, paranoid man (Freeman) mentally over-analyses the situations he stumbles into and worries that he looks like he has perverted intentions. He then panics and shouts out loud that he isn't, to the bewilderment of people around him. *All Pile On: An obese man with a high- pitched voice (Holness) seizes any opportunity to call out \\"All pile on!\\" when he comes across someone lying on a flat surface in public, causing a group of strangers to appear and stack themselves on the unsuspecting victim. *Q: A James Bond spoof in which inventor Q (Mitchell) shows off new \\"weapons\\" to James Bond (Freeman) which are mostly ordinary objects. Q never demonstrates them properly. Instead, he takes out his fury on a dummy by punching and kicking an imaginary enemy. *Sparky: A mischievous puppet named Sparky (voiced by Webb) constantly pranks and publicly humiliates his human friend Roger (Freeman). *Pussy on a Stick: A suave Australian man (Holness) boasts about various hobbies he participates in to pick up women, including lawn bowls, choir singing, and grave tending, calling them \\"Pussy on a stick.\\" *Touchy Builder: A builder (Holness) becomes extremely angry about being called \\"touchy\\" by his workmate (Freeman). *Bickering Couple: A married couple, Gary and Samantha (Freeman and Colman), constantly argue about Gary's faddish new interests such as converting to Islam, claiming to be gay, or a fear of being murdered. *Sasha Solomon (Colman), an American TV journalist, viciously offends British actors and actresses during interviews with them, while backhandedly complimenting the UK as being enlightened enough to embrace actors that Americans would never accept. *Hollywood Interviews: A Hollywood celebrity interviewer (Mitchell) interviews celebrities at their homes and makes irrelevant, opinionated remarks. At the same time, he constantly fears offending them. *Steve: A cautiously exploitative man (Webb), who uses hypothetical scenarios and draws logically extreme conclusions with his friends and coworkers to take gross advantage of their offers. *A group of French artists, who carry puppets and remark about dead artists in black and white sketches. The sketch is a parody of French new wave films. *Do You Do Poison?: A fast-paced, tense and inquisitive man (Webb) barges into businesses asking for poison and other outlandish means of killing his wife, but proclaims his innocence whenever the business employee questions his intentions. *Girl Talk: A pair of female friends (Colman and Hudson) discuss sexual habits in a bar, constantly finishing each other's sentences until Colman's character says something different or unusual, causing Hudson's character to be disgusted. * A man (Freeman) attempts to impress a woman (Colman) by doing silly things from a distance, then eventually injures himself or others in the process. * Workers in an office fall victim to childish pranks, before lamenting to the camera the inconvenience it has brought them. *Condescending Worker: A frustrated, angry, and sarcastic man (Mitchell) who works in various roles (e.g. bartender) acts condescendingly and insultingly towards the people he is serving. He proves himself utterly incompetent at the task at hand and angrily berating himself. *BBC Knowledge Fun Size: A parody of the BBC's Bite Size TV series. Presenters (Webb and Hudson) give banal A-Level revision \\"lessons\\" on subjects such as French, Geography, and Philosophy, consisting entirely of useless, irrelevant or incorrect information. *Cultured Dilettante: A man (Freeman) tries to convince his friends (Holness and Hudson) that he is cultured and knowledgeable in areas such as modern art, jazz, and ballet. *Two police officers (Mitchell and Webb) go about their duties for a documentary-style show. Webb's character has great difficulty explaining very simple concepts to the viewer, and is at times incompetent at his job. Mitchell plays a brooding, violent policeman of few words.

It is based on quasi-linearization, which is the approximation of the non-linear system under investigation by a linear time- invariant (LTI) transfer function that depends on the amplitude of the input waveform. By definition, a transfer function of a true LTI system cannot depend on the amplitude of the input function because an LTI system is linear. Thus, this dependence on amplitude generates a family of linear systems that are combined in an attempt to capture salient features of the non-linear system behavior. The describing function is one of the few widely applicable methods for designing nonlinear systems, and is very widely used as a standard mathematical tool for analyzing limit cycles in closed-loop controllers, such as industrial process controls, servomechanisms, and electronic oscillators. The method Consider feedback around a discontinuous (but piecewise continuous) nonlinearity (e.g., an amplifier with saturation, or an element with deadband effects) cascaded with a slow stable linear system. The continuous region in which the feedback is presented to the nonlinearity depends on the amplitude of the output of the linear system. As the linear system's output amplitude decays, the nonlinearity may move into a different continuous region. This switching from one continuous region to another can generate periodic oscillations. The describing function method attempts to predict characteristics of those oscillations (e.g., their fundamental frequency) by assuming that the slow system acts like a low-pass or bandpass filter that concentrates all energy around a single frequency. Even if the output waveform has several modes, the method can still provide intuition about properties like frequency and possibly amplitude; in this case, the describing function method can be thought of as describing the sliding mode of the feedback system. Nonlinear system in the state of harmonic balance Using this low-pass assumption, the system response can be described by one of a family of sinusoidal waveforms; in this case the system would be characterized by a sine input describing function (SIDF) H(A,\\\\,j\\\\omega) giving the system response to an input consisting of a sine wave of amplitude A and frequency \\\\omega. This SIDF is a modification of the transfer function H(j\\\\omega) used to characterize linear systems. In a quasi-linear system, when the input is a sine wave, the output will be a sine wave of the same frequency but with a scaled amplitude and shifted phase as given by H(A,\\\\,j\\\\omega). Many systems are approximately quasi-linear in the sense that although the response to a sine wave is not a pure sine wave, most of the energy in the output is indeed at the same frequency \\\\omega as the input. This is because such systems may possess intrinsic low-pass or bandpass characteristics such that harmonics are naturally attenuated, or because external filters are added for this purpose. An important application of the SIDF technique is to estimate the oscillation amplitude in sinusoidal electronic oscillators. Other types of describing functions that have been used are DFs for level inputs and for Gaussian noise inputs. Although not a complete description of the system, the DFs often suffice to answer specific questions about control and stability. DF methods are best for analyzing systems with relatively weak nonlinearities. In addition the higher order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDF), describe the response of a class of nonlinear systems at harmonics of the input frequency of a sinusoidal input. The HOSIDFs are an extension of the SIDF for systems where the nonlinearities are significant in the response. Caveats Although the describing function method can produce reasonably accurate results for a wide class of systems, it can fail badly for others. For example, the method can fail if the system emphasizes higher harmonics of the nonlinearity. Such examples have been presented by Tzypkin for bang-bang systems. A fairly similar example is a closed-loop oscillator consisting of a non-inverting Schmitt trigger followed by an inverting integrator that feeds back its output to the Schmitt trigger's input. The output of the Schmitt trigger is going to be a square waveform, while that of the integrator (following it) is going to have a triangle waveform with peaks coinciding with the transitions in the square wave. Each of these two oscillator stages lags the signal exactly by 90 degrees (relative to its input). If one were to perform DF analysis on this circuit, the triangle wave at the Schmitt trigger's input would be replaced by its fundamental (sine wave), which passing through the trigger would cause a phase shift of less than 90 degrees (because the sine wave would trigger it sooner than the triangle wave does) so the system would appear not to oscillate in the same (simple) way. Also, in the case where the conditions for Aizerman's or Kalman conjectures are fulfilled, there are no periodic solutions by describing function method,, but counterexamples with hidden periodic attractors are known. Counterexamples to the describing function method can be constructed for discontinuous dynamical systems when a rest segment destroys predicted limit cycles. Therefore, the application of the describing function method requires additional justification. . References Further reading * N. Krylov and N.

Greenfield and Jean-Jacques Burnel released an album together in 1983, Fire & Water (Ecoutez Vos Murs), which was used as the soundtrack for the film Ecoutez vos murs, directed by Vincent Coudanne. =Musical style and equipment= Greenfield's sound and style of playing, particularly on The Stranglers' debut album Rattus Norvegicus, has been compared to that of Ray Manzarek of the Doors. The comparison was even made at the Stranglers' inception by Jean-Jacques Burnel, who said Greenfield had not heard of the Doors at the time. Greenfield himself said he was more influenced by the work of Rick Wakeman and Yes. He was also noted for his trademark style of playing rapid arpeggios. His distinctive sound on the early Stranglers recordings involved the use of Hohner Cembalet (model N), Hammond L-100 electric organ, a Minimoog synthesizer, and later an Oberheim OB-Xa. Greenfield wrote a piece of waltz-time harpsichord music during recording for The Meninblack, which was discarded by other members of The Stranglers, but was later adapted into their biggest hit \\"Golden Brown\\", with lyrics from Hugh Cornwell and music from Greenfield and Jet Black, although the band themselves did not initially see this as a potential single. In addition to its chart success, the song also won an Ivor Novello award. =Vocal performances= Greenfield at the Cambridge Corn Exchange in 2018 On the albums The Raven, The Gospel According to the Meninblack and Aural Sculpture, Greenfield used a Korg VC-10 vocoder.

The film stars John Carradine as a scientist who tests his experiment on Jon Hall, a psychiatric hospital escapee who takes the invisibility serum and then goes on a crime spree. The film was announced on June 10, 1943, and began shooting on January 10, 1944 finishing in mid-February. On its release, reviews in The New York Herald-Tribune, The New York Daily News and The New York World-Telegram noted that the film series and its special effects became tired, while a review in The Hollywood Reporter declared it as one of the best in the series. Plot After murdering two orderlies, Robert Griffin escapes from the secluded Cape Town mental institution where he has been committed, and now he is looking for revenge on the respectable Herrick family. A family consisting of Sir Jasper and lady Irene, and their daughter Julie, who are engaged in entertaining, and inspecting, Julie's new boyfriend, newspaper journalist Mark Foster, in the family residence. Later that night Julie and Mark leave the residence together, and Sir Jasper and lady Irene are left alone. That's when Robert decides to pay the couple a visit. Quite unexpectedly he enters the residence and accuses the couple of leaving him to die out in the African wild, injured when they were on a safari together. The Herrick couple defends themselves, claiming they were told that he was dead and not injured, but Robert doesn't buy their explanation. He demands they give him his share of the diamond fields they all discovered together on the safari. Jasper tries to tell Robert that the diamond fields were all lost in a series of bad investments. Robert refuses to give in, threatening to sue the Herricks, and to calm him down and get him off their backs, they offer him a share in an estate, the Shortlands. His counter-proposal is that they should arrange for him to be married to their daughter Julie. After saying this, he is drugged by Lady Irene and passes out in their home. The Herricks realize that their old friend and companion has gone completely mad, and while they are frightened of what he could do to them if they don't comply to his wish, they see no problem with stealing the agreement made or pushing him further along the path of insanity with their betrayal. They search Robert's clothes and find the written partnership agreement they all entered into some time ago. Taking the paper, they next callously throw Robert out of their house. Robert nearly drowns where he lies, unconscious, but is saved by a local Cockney cobbler by the name of Herbert Higgins. Herbert decides to use this newfound possibility - the information he got from Robert - to blackmail the Herricks. He is unsuccessful, as Jasper calls on chief constable Sir Frederick Travers. The chief constable declares Robert's claims to the Herricks' estate as void and orders him to leave his jurisdiction. Robert leaves for London, but on his way he happens to come by the home of eager scientist Dr. Peter Drury. This scientist is involved in some questionable research, and is very eager to find a suitable subject to test his new experimental formula on - a formula for invisibility. Robert asks that the doctor try it on him, and he agrees, completely in the dark of the fact that Robert wants to use this to get his revenge on the Herricks. Robert forces Jasper to sign over their entire estate to him. He also finds time to help his saviour Herbert to win a game of darts at the local inn. Jasper secretly also agrees to give his daughter's hand in marriage to Robert - if he ever regains his visibility. Robert goes back to the scientists laboratory and witnesses how the doctor restores visibility to his dog Brutus, by giving him a blood transfusion. Robert breaks into the laboratory and knocks the doctor unconscious, before performing a blood transfusion on himself, using the doctor's blood. The transfusion results in the doctor's death, and to avoid capture, Robert sets the laboratory on fire and takes off just before the police arrive on the scene. Robert changes his identity to \\"Martin Field\\" and moves in with the Herricks at the estate which he is now owner of. When Herbert finds out about Robert's return he makes a futile attempt to blackmail him too, and out of pity - and perhaps thankfulness - Robert pays the man one thousand pounds to get rid of him. Robert has one condition for paying the money: that Herbert kills the doctor's dog Brutus, who has followed Robert back to the Herrick estate after the fire. Robert starts losing his visibility one day at the breakfast table, with Julie and her fianc√© Mark present. He tricks Mark to follow him down into the wine cellar, where he knocks the man out, starting another, second blood transfusion with Mark's blood. Chief Constable Travers arrives at the estate after he has found out about Robert's return. With some help from Herbert and Jasper they break into the cellar just as the transfusion is about to be completed, in time to save Mark's life. Robert is attacked by the still very much alive Brutus, and killed. Mark tells the others that Griffin went insane when he was locked up in the asylum, and meant no one any harm until he escaped. Cast Production Universal first announced the plan for The Invisible Man's Revenge on June 10, 1943 with the hopes of having Claude Rains performing in the lead. Other cast members who were lined up for the film were Edgar Barrier who opted out of the production on January 6, after being disenchanted with the roles he had in films like Phantom of the Opera and Cobra Woman. Prior to the first day of shooting the film, Universal's attorneys made a deal with H. G. Wells for the rights to make two more Invisible Man sequels between July 1943 and October 1951. Production on the film began on January 10, 1944 and continued for five weeks and three days finishing in mid-February. After this, John P. Fulton took over to complete the special effects sequences. The film's final cost was $314,790 Release The Invisible Man's Revenge was distributed theatrically by the Universal Pictures Company on June 9, 1944.The films worldwide gross was $765,700. The film was released on DVD on as part of the \\"Invisible Man: The Legacy Collection\\" set, which included The Invisible Man, The Invisible Man Returns, The Invisible Woman and Invisible Agent. It was released again on blu ray as part of the \\"Invisible Man: The Complete Legacy Collection\\" on August 28, 2018. Reception From contemporary reviews, Howard Barnes of The New York Herald-Tribune found the film \\"singularly unexciting\\" finding John Fulton's special photography as \\"the most striking aspect of the picture [but] the tricks have been done too often before by the camera to make them particularly effective by themselves.\\" Wanda Hale of The New York Daily News echoed this statement, finding that \\"the frightening creature [...] is no novelty\\" and that the film was \\"not the stimulating thriller that The Invisible Man was.\\" A reviewer in The New York World-Telegram declared that \\"some of the earlier variations of H.G. Wells' invisible man idea were filmed with an idea that the story should make good sense. That policy has been abandoned this time\\" while still noting that Jon Hall was being \\"a much more effective actor than he has been in some of his recent adventures in gaudy Technicolor.\\" Conversely, a reviewer from The Hollywood Reporter declared it as one \\"of the best and most entertaining of the series\\" From retrospective reviews, the authors of the book Universal Horrors declared the film to be \\"the least ambitious but hardly the least entertaining of Universal's widely varying series\\" noting it's \\"no frills approach to its subject matter\\" declaring it better than The Invisible Woman and Invisible Agent but not as strong as The Invisible Man or The Invisible Man Returns. Special effects in the film were described as \\"have a slapdash quality\\" with only a few pulling of \\"startlingly effective tricks.\\" Actor John Carradine, who loathed the horror films he worked in, was asked in the British fanzine House of Hammer if he liked any of the horror films he was in, and he responded he enjoyed The Invisible Man's Revenge .

It is made by soaking fruit in Scotch whisky and then heating it to absorb the liquor. History There is much speculation about its origin and its rather curious name. Many culinary scholars think the name of the dish is a reference to the frequent invasions of Scots into Northern England before the new Stuart era united the two nations. These attacks began during Roman times, resulting in the building of Hadrian's Wall, and continued throughout the Middle Ages until James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, became King of England. The name is a pun on the similarity of 'Scotch' to 'Scot', the idea being that the Scotch has 'invaded' the natural juices of the fruit. Recipe \\"Marauding Scot\\" is made in a similar way to the Cockney dish \\"peaches done in Brandy\\", as mentioned in the 1959 film version of The 39 Steps, namely by taking the fruit, piercing it, then pouring Scotch over it while it is gently heated. There is much debate about the sequence used. Some believe that it is better to pierce it after the heating has taken place, otherwise it would lose its natural flavour, whereas other chefs believe this misses the point slightly. Other chefs suggest that the heating is unnecessary and in fact dries the fruit, spoiling its taste. Warning: The flammable nature of Scotch means that this dish should be attempted with great caution. The dish is traditionally served with shortbread, inkeeping with its Scottish reference. Notoriety In one of his famous printed sermons of 1549, Thomas, rector of Crawcrook mentions the \\"Pillaging Scotte\\" as an evil influence on the young people of the town, who had clearly been using the dish as an early form of hip flask. The inclusion of Scotch into other recipes to be found throughout the UK is notable, such as a similar dish which is found in Norfolk.

He wrote architectural criticism for the San Francisco Chronicle from 1961 to 1993. He also taught city planning and the social sciences at the University of California, Berkeley and California State University, Hayward (now California State University, East Bay). Following Finnish-born architect Eero Saarinen's death in 1961, Temko published Eero Saarinen (1962), a critical examination of Saarinen's most famous works from the General Motors Technical Center to the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial and its Gateway Arch (still in the planning stages at the time), as a volume in George Braziller's Makers of Contemporary Architecture series. Temko was an activist critic who defended the urban character and texture of San Francisco from, in his words, \\"a variety of villains: real estate sharks, the construction industry and its unions, venal politicians, bureaucrats, brutal highway engineers, the automobile lobby, and ‚Äì in some ways worst of all ‚Äì incompetent architects and invertebrate planners who were wrecking the Bay Area before our eyes.\\" One of these villains, an architect named Sandy Walker, famously sued Temko over his 1978 description of Walker's Pier 39 project which began, \\"Corn. Kitsch. Schlock. Honky-tonk. Dreck. Schmaltz. Merde.\\" Temko was instrumental in the removal of the Embarcadero Freeway and memorably described the 1971 Vaillancourt Fountain on the Embarcadero as a thing \\"deposited by a concrete dog with square intestines.\\" He described the City Center Building in Hayward in the early 1970s, calling it a \\"toaster\\", due to its slightly elongated rectangular shape, which strongly influenced public opinion of the building. Temko, who met Jack Kerouac when they were both undergraduates at Columbia, appears in Kerouac's novel On the Road as the model for the character \\"Roland Major\\". Temko also appeared in Kerouac's Book of Dreams as Irving Minko and in Visions of Cody as Allen Minko. He called for an international design competition for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, saying that both the single-tower cable-stayed scheme (favored by T.Y. Lin) and the single-masted self-anchored suspension design ultimately chosen were incapable of being \\"a world-famous work of engineering art.\\" Temko was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1990. He died of apparent congestive heart failure at the Orinda Convalescent Hospital in Orinda, California, in 2006.

The Teatro dell'Opera di Roma (Rome Opera House) is an opera house in Rome, Italy.\\"Teatro dell'Opera in Rome, Toni Servillo for \\"Egmont\\"\\" Teatrio Online. Retrieved 2017-05-30. Originally opened in November 1880 as the 2,212 seat Costanzi Theatre, it has undergone several changes of name as well modifications and improvements. The present house seats 1,600. The original Teatro Costanzi: 1880 to 1926 The Teatro dell'Opera was originally known as the Teatro Costanzi after the contractor who built it, Domenico Costanzi (1810-1898). It was financed by Costanzi, who commissioned the Milanese architect Achille Sfondrini (1836-1900), a specialist in the building and renovation of theatres. The opera house was built in eighteen months, on the site where the house of Heliogabalus stood in ancient times, and was inaugurated on 27 November 1880 with a performance of Semiramide by Gioachino Rossini. Designing the theatre, Sfondrini paid particular attention to the acoustics, conceiving the interior structure as a \\"resonance chamber\\", as is evident from the horseshoe shape in particular. With a seating capacity of 2,212, the house had three tiers of boxes, an amphitheatre and two separate galleries, surmounted by a dome adorned with splendid frescoes by Annibale Brugnoli. Costanzi was obliged to manage the theater himself. Under his direction, and despite financial problems, the opera house held many world premieres of operas, including Cavalleria rusticana by Pietro Mascagni on 17 May 1890. For a brief period the theatre was managed by Costanzi's son, Enrico, who gained renown by organizing another great premiere, that of Tosca by Giacomo Puccini on 14 January 1900. In 1907 the Teatro Costanzi was purchased by the impresario Walter Mocchi (1870-1955) on behalf of the Societ√† Teatrale Internazionale e Nazionale (STIN). In 1912 Mocchi's wife, Emma Carelli, became the managing director of the new Impresa Costanzi, as the theatre was later known, following various changes in the company structure. During the fourteen years of her tenure, major works which had not been performed before in Rome (or even in Italy) were staged. These included La fanciulla del West, Turandot and Il trittico by Giacomo Puccini; Parsifal by Richard Wagner; Francesca da Rimini (Zandonai) by Riccardo Zandonai; Boris Godunov by Modest Mussorgsky; Samson et Dalila by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns and many others. Diaghilev's Ballets Russes also performed. The restructured Teatro Reale dell'Opera: 1926 to 1946 In November 1926 the Costanzi was bought by the Rome City Council and its name changed to Teatro Reale dell'Opera. A partial rebuilding ensued, led by architect Marcello Piacentini and lasting fifteen months. The house re-opened on 27 February 1928 with the opera Nerone by Arrigo Boito. Chief among several major changes was the relocated entrance, from the street formerly known as Via del Teatro (where the garden of the Hotel Quirinale is now) to the opposite side, where Piazza Beniamino Gigli exists today. In addition, the amphitheatre inside the theatre was replaced by a fourth tier of boxes (now the third tier) and the balcony. The interior was embellished by new stuccowork, decorations, and furnishings, including a magnificent chandelier measuring six meters in diameter and composed of 27,000 crystal drops. Above the proscenium arch is a plaque commemorating the rebuilding: \\"Vittorio Emanuele III Rege, Benito Mussolini Duce, Lodovicus Spada Potenziani, Romae Gubernator Restituit MCMXXVIII‚ÄîVI‚Äù\\". Confusingly the dates appear to be back to front. (The VI refers to the sixth year after the Fascist's March on Rome of 1922.) The present Teatro dell'Opera di Roma: from 1946 Following the end of monarchy, the name was simplified to Teatro dell'Opera and, in 1958, the building was again remodeled and modernized. Rome City Council again commissioned architect Marcello Piacentini, who radically altered the building's style, notably with regard to the facade, entrance and foyer, each of these taking the form we know today. The theater's legendary acoustics still bear comparison with any other auditorium in the world. The seating capacity is about 1,600. The house was retrofitted with air-conditioning subsequent to a restoration, which provided improvements to the interior. The stucco work was completely restored, the great proscenium arch strengthened, and a parquet floor of solid oak blocks laid to replace the previous one. On 2 January 1958 the theater was the venue for a controversial performance of Norma starring Maria Callas in the presence of the President of Italy: for health reasons, Callas abandoned the performance after the first act (the opera company had not engaged an understudy). The post-war period saw celebrated productions, including Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro in 1964 and Verdi's Don Carlo in 1965, both conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini and directed by Luchino Visconti. From 2001 to 2010, the music director and chief conductor of the company was Gianluigi Gelmetti. He was due to be succeeded in these posts by Riccardo Muti, as announced in August 2009, but Muti demurred, citing in La Repubblica in October 2010 \\"general difficulties that are plaguing the Italian opera houses\\". Later, Muti assumed a role similar to that of music director but without title. Notable productions under Muti have included Gluck's \\"Iphig√©nie en Aulide\\" (2009), Verdi's \\"Nabucco\\" (2011), \\"Simon Boccanegra\\" (2012) and \\"Ernani\\" (2013). Daniele Gatti first guest-conducted with the company during the 2016‚Äì2017 season. He returned for subsequent guest engagements in each of the following two seasons. In December 2018, the company announced the appointment of Gatti as its new music director, with immediate effect. The name \\"Teatro Costanzi\\" remains officially in use, to refer to the main auditorium. Opera company's summer venue The outdoor theatre at the Baths of Caracalla, with the Roman ruins as the backdrop, is the venue for the opera company's summertime presentations in Rome.

History First started in 1977 in Rod Parsley's parent's backyard, the church consisted of 17 people. Two years later Parsley bought property for the church to be built on. 180 people were attending at this point. In 1982 the seating was doubled. The number of people was so large that a second Sunday morning service was added. This influenced Parsley to upgrade the church, and in 1984 1200 more seats were added. Now sitting on Gender Road in Columbus, Ohio, the church seats over 5,200 people and contains an auditorium, a television studio, a children's ministry that includes Sunday school for children newborn to 6th grade, Harvest Preparatory School, and administrative offices. The church sits on and is .Our Story It was built by Roe Messner. Parsley's Breakthrough television program is taped at the church. Breakthrough is a program put on by the church. The church also incorporates Valor Christian College, a young, co-educational institution located outside Columbus. It used to be three miles from the church, but now sits on the same property where World Harvest Church is located. Breakthrough Breakthrough is the television ministry of World Harvest Church. It airs twice a day, six days a week, and is available in 97 percent of the United States and in most other nations. The show features Parsley's sermons as well as interviews with guests, often in front of a studio audience. The programs are produced from a studio on the church's Columbus campus that was formally dedicated in August 2008. Its facilities rival those of local network affiliates in the city. Breakthrough is carried on 1,400 stations and cable affiliates, including Daystar Television Network and Trinity Broadcasting Network. The broadcast is also available internationally on the HotBird6 and Thaicom 3 satellites.\\"Find a Local Station\\" https://www.rodparsley.com/findastation Accessed 2016-03-29  Valor Christian College  This is a Bible school and general studies college associated with the World Harvest Church located in Columbus, Ohio, on property originally built by World Harvest Church. This college is accredited with the Association for Biblical Higher Education and authorized by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools to offer Associate of Applied Science degrees and diplomas in Bible and ministry-related studies. Controversies A group of churches and synagogues from Columbus requested that the IRS perform an inquiry about the church's political activities. The group accused the church of illegally campaigning on the behalf of former Ohio Gubernatorial candidate Ken Blackwell. The IRS does not comment publicly on potential or ongoing investigations, therefore it is not known if anything came of the request. A family noticed injuries on their 2-year-old son after attending the on site daycare at the church in January 2006. They believed he was struck with a ruler while under the care of a teacher in the employ of the church. When the parents brought the injuries to the attention of the church, they were banned from the property and threatened with criminal trespassing charges if they ever returned. The Church and the teacher were found liable in a lawsuit brought by the parents of the 2 year old child for causing injury while spanking the child. The jury awarded the family US$5 million in punitive damages, and US$999,100 in compensatory damages, reduced at appeal: \\"On May 23, 2008, the trial court entered a final judgment of $2,871,431.87 in favor of plaintiffs. WHC is solely liable for $2,789,066.87 of the judgment; Vaughan is primarily liable, and WHC secondarily liable, for the remaining $82,365 in compensatory damages entered against Vaughan.\\" The Church then sued their insurer, Grange Mutual Casualty Co. In May 2016 the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that their insurance policy did not cover the damages as the policy contained an abuse and molestation exclusion.

Technologies = Existing technologies = Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector. Three forms of human enhancement currently exist: reproductive, physical, and mental. Reproductive enhancements include embryo selection by preimplantation genetic diagnosis, cytoplasmic transfer, and in vitro-generated gametes. Physical enhancements include cosmetics (plastic surgery & orthodontics), Drug-induced (doping & performance-enhancing drugs), functional (prosthetics & powered exoskeletons), Medical (implants (e.g. pacemaker) & organ replacements ( e.g. bionic lenses)), and strength training (weights (e.g. barbells) & dietary supplement)). Examples of mental enhancements are nootropics, neuro-stimulation, and supplements that improve mental functions. Computers, mobile phones, and Internet can also be used to enhance cognitive efficiency. Notable efforts in human augmentation are driven by the interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including wearable electronics (e.g., augmented reality glasses, smart watches, smart textile), personal drones, on-body and in-body nanonetworks. = Emerging technologies = Many different forms of human enhancing technologies are either on the way or are currently being tested and trialed. A few of these emerging technologies include: human genetic engineering (gene therapy), neurotechnology (neural implants and brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces), cyberware, Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence, nanomedicine, and 3D bioprinting. = Speculative technologies = A few hypothetical human enhancement technologies are under speculation, such as: Mind uploading, Exocortex, and endogenous artificial nutrition. Mind uploading is the hypothetical process of \\"transferring\\"/\\"uploading\\" or copying a conscious mind from a brain to a non-biological substrate by scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. Exocortex can be defined as a theoretical artificial external information processing system that would augment a brain's biological high-level cognitive processes. Endogenous artificial nutrition can be similar to having a radioisotope generator that resynthesizes glucose (similarly to photosynthesis), amino acids and vitamins from their degradation products, theoretically availing for weeks without food if necessary.  Nootropics  There are many substances that are purported to have promise in augmenting human cognition by various means. These substances are called nootropics and can potentially benefit individuals with cognitive decline and many different disorders, but may also be capable of yielding results in cognitively healthy persons. Generally speaking, nootropics are said to be effective for enhancing focus, learning, memory function, mood, and in some cases, physical brain developement. Some examples of these include Citicoline, Huperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, Bacopa monnieri, Acetyl-L-carnitine, Uridine monophosphate, L-theanine, Rhodiola rosea, and Pycnogenol which are all forms of dietary supplement. There are also nootropic drugs such as the common racetams Piracetam and Noopept (Omberacetam) along with the neuroprotective Semax, and N-Acetyl Semax. There are also nootropics related to naturally occurring substances but that are either modified in a lab or are analogs such as Vinpocetine and Sulbutiamine.  Ethics  Much debate surrounds the topic of human enhancement and the means used to achieve one's enhancement goals. An ethical agenda of human enhancement can depend on many factors such as religious affiliation, age, gender, ethnicity, a culture of origin, and nationality. In some circles the expression \\"human enhancement\\" is roughly synonymous with human genetic engineering, but most often it is referred to the general application of the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science (NBIC) to improve human performance. Since the 1990s, several academics (such as some of the fellows of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies) have risen to become advocates of the case for human enhancement while other academics (such as the members of President Bush's Council on Bioethics) have become outspoken critics. Advocacy of the case for human enhancement is increasingly becoming synonymous with \\"transhumanism\\", a controversial ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens to either maintain or modify their own minds and bodies; so as to guarantee them the freedom of choice and informed consent of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children. Their common understanding of the world can be seen from a physicist perspective rather than a biological perspective. Based on the idea of technological singularity, human enhancement is merging with technological innovation that will advance post humanism. Neuromarketing consultant Zack Lynch argues that neurotechnologies will have a more immediate effect on society than gene therapy and will face less resistance as a pathway of radical human enhancement. He also argues that the concept of \\"enablement\\" needs to be added to the debate over \\"therapy\\" versus \\"enhancement\\". The prospect of human enhancement has sparked public controversy. The main question to the ethical debate on human enhancement mainly involves whether there should be no restriction, some restrictions or a full ban to the entire concept. Dale Carrico wrote that \\"human enhancement\\" is a loaded term which has eugenic overtones because it may imply the improvement of human hereditary traits to attain a universally accepted norm of biological fitness (at the possible expense of human biodiversity and neurodiversity), and therefore can evoke negative reactions far beyond the specific meaning of the term. Michael Selgelid terms this as a phase of \\"neugenics\\" suggesting that gene enhancements occurring now have already revived the idea of eugenics in our society. Practices of prenatal diagnosis, selective abortion and in- vitro fertilization aims to improve human life allowing for parents to decide via genetic information if they want to continue or terminate the pregnancy. A common criticism of human enhancement is that it will create unfair physical or mental advantages, or unequal access to such enhancements can and will further the gulf between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\".Michael Hauskeller, Better Humans?: Understanding the Enhancement Project, Acumen, 2013, . Futurist Ray Kurzweil has shown some concern that, within the century, humans may be required to merge with this technology in order to compete in the marketplace. Enhanced individuals have a better chance of being chosen for better opportunities in careers, entertainment and resources. For example, life extending technologies can increase the average individual life span affecting the distribution of pension throughout the society. Increasing lifespan will affect human population further dividing limited resources such as food, energy, monetary resources and habitat. Other critics of human enhancement fear that such capabilities would change, for the worse, the dynamic relations within a family. Given the choices of superior qualities, parents make their child as opposed to merely birthing it, and the newborn becomes a product of their will rather than a gift of nature to be loved unconditionally. = Effects on Identity = Human enhancement technologies can impact human identity by affecting one's self-conception. The argument does not necessarily come from the idea of improving the individual but rather changing who they are and becoming someone new. Altering an individual identity affects their personal story, development and mental capabilities. The basis of this argument comes from two main points : the charge of inauthenticity and the charge of violating an individual's core characteristics. Gene therapy has the ability to alter one mental capacity and through this argument, has the ability to affect their narrative identity. An individual's core characteristics may include internal psychological style, personality, general intelligence, necessity to sleep, normal aging, gender and being Homo sapiens. Technologies threaten to alter the self fundamentally to the point where the result is a different person. For example, extreme changes in personality may affect the individual's relationships because others can no longer relate to the new person. The capability approach focuses on a normative framework that can be applied to how human enhancement technologies affects human capabilities. The ethics of this does not necessarily focus on the make up of the individual but rather what it allows individuals to do in today's society. This approach was first termed by Amartya Sen, where he mainly focused on the objectives of the approach rather than the aim for those objectives which entail resources, technological processes, and economic arrangement. The central human capabilities include life, bodily health, bodily integrity, sense, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, and control over one's environment. This normative framework recognizes that human capabilities are always changing and technology has already played a part in this. = Enhancement Rhetoric (HER) = In his essay \\"Mapping human enhancement rhetoric\\", Thayer (2014) states that the growth of Human Enhancement Technology (HET) means a corresponding growth in the discourse of HET, so he suggests inventing a new classification called Human Enhancement Rhetoric (HER). To establish this classification, Thayer focuses on answering four existential questions: (1) what is HER?, (2) how can HER be mapped?, (3) what does this project of mapping HER accomplish?, and (4) what global issues or ethical concerns are raised, or can be further understood, by mapping HER? These foundational questions serve to introduce Thayer's newly conceived boundaries, definitions, nomenclature, and ethical arguments as he works to create a discourse that industry professionals and academics can study, navigate, and grow. =Human nature and existential risks= Human enhancement will bring forward unprecedented ethical dilemmas and existential risks. In addition to issues related to meritocracy, fairness and social disruptions, enhancements will inevitably touch upon deeper philosophical questions. Prof Nayef Al-Rodhan from Oxford University cautions against the inevitability of pursuing enhancements to the point that they lead humanity on the way to trans- and post-humanism. This inevitable course, he argues, is rooted in our own human nature, which seeks neurochemical gratification and is driven by five powerful motivators, which he calls the Neuro P5: power, profit, pleasure, pride and permanency. When a technology appears that promises to enhance one or all of these motivators, humans will pursue those technologies even if that may prove to be dangerous in the long run. Before that critical turning point in human evolution, other ethical and philosophical issues may be more stringent, however, at least in the short term. In another work, Al-Rodhan takes issue with another fundamental aspect of enhancement and artificial neuromodulation. He cautions against the risks posed by such interventions to the authenticity of the human experience and to the very notion of identity, and the loss of free will.

It results in the highly diverse repertoire of antibodies/immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (TCRs) found in B cells and T cells, respectively. The process is a defining feature of the adaptive immune system. V(D)J recombination in mammals occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells and thymus for T cells) and in a nearly random fashion rearranges variable (V), joining (J), and in some cases, diversity (D) gene segments. The process ultimately results in novel amino acid sequences in the antigen- binding regions of immunoglobulins and TCRs that allow for the recognition of antigens from nearly all pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and worms as well as \\"altered self cells\\" as seen in cancer. The recognition can also be allergic in nature (e.g. to pollen or other allergens) or may match host tissues and lead to autoimmunity. In 1987, Susumu Tonegawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for his discovery of the genetic principle for generation of antibody diversity\\".  Background  Human antibody molecules (including B cell receptors) are composed of heavy and light chains, each of which contains both constant (C) and variable (V) regions, genetically encoded on three loci: *The immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH@) on chromosome 14, containing the gene segments for the immunoglobulin heavy chain. *The immunoglobulin kappa (Œ∫) locus (IGK@) on chromosome 2, containing the gene segments for part of the immunoglobulin light chain. *The immunoglobulin lambda (Œª) locus (IGL@) on chromosome 22, containing the gene segments for the remainder of the immunoglobulin light chain. Each heavy chain or light chain gene contains multiple copies of three different types of gene segments for the variable regions of the antibody proteins. For example, the human immunoglobulin heavy chain region contains 2 Constant (CŒº and CŒ¥) gene segments and 44 Variable (V) gene segments, plus 27 Diversity (D) gene segments and 6 Joining (J) gene segments. The light chain genes possess either a single (CŒ∫) or four (CŒª) Constant gene segments with numerous V and J gene segments but do not have D gene segments. DNA rearrangement causes one copy of each type of gene segment to go in any given lymphocyte, generating an enormous antibody repertoire; roughly 3√ó1011 combinations are possible, although some are removed due to self reactivity. Most T-cell receptors are composed of a variable alpha chain and a beta chain. The T cell receptor genes are similar to immunoglobulin genes in that they too contain multiple V, D, and J gene segments in their beta chains (and V and J gene segments in their alpha chains) that are rearranged during the development of the lymphocyte to provide that cell with a unique antigen receptor. The T cell receptor in this sense is the topological equivalent to an antigen-binding fragment of the antibody, both being part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. An autoimmune response is prevented by eliminating cells that self-react. This occurs in the thymus by testing the cell against an array of self antigens expressed through the function of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE). The immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus contains protein-coding genes that can be lost with its rearrangement. This is based on a physiological mechanism and is not pathogenetic for leukemias or lymphomas. A cell persists if it creates a successful product that does not self-react, otherwise it is pruned via apoptosis. Immunoglobulins Simplistic overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains =Heavy chain= In the developing B cell, the first recombination event to occur is between one D and one J gene segment of the heavy chain locus. Any DNA between these two gene segments is deleted. This D-J recombination is followed by the joining of one V gene segment, from a region upstream of the newly formed DJ complex, forming a rearranged VDJ gene segment. All other gene segments between V and D segments are now deleted from the cell's genome. Primary transcript (unspliced RNA) is generated containing the VDJ region of the heavy chain and both the constant mu and delta chains (CŒº and CŒ¥). (i.e. the primary transcript contains the segments: V-D-J-CŒº-CŒ¥). The primary RNA is processed to add a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the CŒº chain and to remove sequence between the VDJ segment and this constant gene segment. Translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the IgM heavy chain protein. =Light chain= The kappa (Œ∫) and lambda (Œª) chains of the immunoglobulin light chain loci rearrange in a very similar way, except that the light chains lack a D segment. In other words, the first step of recombination for the light chains involves the joining of the V and J chains to give a VJ complex before the addition of the constant chain gene during primary transcription. Translation of the spliced mRNA for either the kappa or lambda chains results in formation of the Ig Œ∫ or Ig Œª light chain protein. Assembly of the Ig Œº heavy chain and one of the light chains results in the formation of membrane bound form of the immunoglobulin IgM that is expressed on the surface of the immature B cell. T cell receptors During thymocyte development, the T cell receptor (TCR) chains undergo essentially the same sequence of ordered recombination events as that described for immunoglobulins. D-to-J recombination occurs first in the Œ≤-chain of the TCR. This process can involve either the joining of the DŒ≤1 gene segment to one of six JŒ≤1 segments or the joining of the DŒ≤2 gene segment to one of six JŒ≤2 segments. DJ recombination is followed (as above) with VŒ≤-to-DŒ≤JŒ≤ rearrangements. All gene segments between the VŒ≤-DŒ≤-JŒ≤ gene segments in the newly formed complex are deleted and the primary transcript is synthesized that incorporates the constant domain gene (VŒ≤-DŒ≤-JŒ≤-CŒ≤). mRNA transcription splices out any intervening sequence and allows translation of the full length protein for the TCR Œ≤-chain. The rearrangement of the alpha (Œ±) chain of the TCR follows Œ≤ chain rearrangement, and resembles V-to-J rearrangement described for Ig light chains (see above). The assembly of the Œ≤- and Œ±- chains results in formation of the Œ±Œ≤-TCR that is expressed on a majority of T cells. Mechanism =Key enzymes and components= The process of V(D)J recombination is mediated by VDJ recombinase, which is a diverse collection of enzymes. The key enzymes involved are recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and Artemis nuclease, a member of the ubiquitous non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA repair. Several other enzymes are known to be involved in the process and include DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), X-ray repair cross- complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), DNA ligase IV, non-homologous end-joining factor 1 (NHEJ1; also known as Cernunnos or XRCC4-like factor [XLF]), the recently discovered Paralog of XRCC4 and XLF (PAXX), and DNA polymerases Œª and Œº. Some enzymes involved are specific to lymphocytes (e.g., RAG, TdT), while others are found in other cell types and even ubiquitously (e.g., NHEJ components). To maintain the specificity of recombination, V(D)J recombinase recognizes and binds to recombination signal sequences (RSSs) flanking the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes segments. RSSs are composed of three elements: a heptamer of seven conserved nucleotides, a spacer region of 12 or 23 basepairs in length, and a nonamer of nine conserved nucleotides. While the majority of RSSs vary in sequence, the consensus heptamer and nonamer sequences are CACAGTG and ACAAAAACC, respectively; and although the sequence of the spacer region is poorly conserved, the length is highly conserved. The length of the spacer region corresponds to approximately one (12 basepairs) or two turns (23 basepairs) of the DNA helix. Following what is known as the 12/23 Rule, gene segments to be recombined are usually adjacent to RSSs of different spacer lengths (i.e., one has a \\"12RSS\\" and one has a \\"23RSS\\"). This is an important feature in the regulation of V(D)J recombination. = Process = V(D)J recombination begins when V(D)J recombinase (through the activity of RAG1) binds a RSS flanking a coding gene segment (V, D, or J) and creates a single-strand nick in the DNA between the first base of the RSS (just before the heptamer) and the coding segment. This is essentially energetically neutral (no need for ATP hydrolysis) and results in the formation of a free 3' hydroxyl group and a 5' phosphate group on the same strand. The reactive hydroxyl group is positioned by the recombinase to attack the phosphodiester bond of opposite strand, forming two DNA ends: a hairpin (stem-loop) on the coding segment and a blunt end on the signal segment. The current model is that DNA nicking and hairpin formation occurs on both strands simultaneously (or nearly so) in a complex known as a recombination center. The blunt signal ends are flush ligated together to form a circular piece of DNA containing all of the intervening sequences between the coding segments known as a signal joint (although circular in nature, this is not to be confused with a plasmid). While originally thought to be lost during successive cell divisions, there is evidence that signal joints may re- enter the genome and lead to pathologies by activating oncogenes or interrupting tumor suppressor gene function(s)[Ref]. The coding ends are processed further prior to their ligation by several events that ultimately lead to junctional diversity. Processing begins when DNA-PK binds to each broken DNA end and recruits several other proteins including Artemis, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, Cernunnos, and several DNA polymerases. DNA-PK forms a complex that leads to its autophosphorylation, resulting in activation of Artemis. The coding end hairpins are opened by the activity of Artemis. If they are opened at the center, a blunt DNA end will result; however in many cases, the opening is \\"off-center\\" and results in extra bases remaining on one strand (an overhang). These are known as palindromic (P) nucleotides due to the palindromic nature of the sequence produced when DNA repair enzymes resolve the overhang. The process of hairpin opening by Artemis is a crucial step of V(D)J recombination and is defective in the severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse model. Next, XRCC4, Cernunnos, and DNA-PK align the DNA ends and recruit terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a template-independent DNA polymerase that adds non-templated (N) nucleotides to the coding end. The addition is mostly random, but TdT does exhibit a preference for G/C nucleotides. As with all known DNA polymerases, the TdT adds nucleotides to one strand in a 5' to 3' direction. Lastly, exonucleases can remove bases from the coding ends (including any P or N nucleotides that may have formed). DNA polymerases Œª and Œº then insert additional nucleotides as needed to make the two ends compatible for joining. This is a stochastic process, therefore any combination of the addition of P and N nucleotides and exonucleolytic removal can occur (or none at all). Finally, the processed coding ends are ligated together by DNA ligase IV. All of these processing events result in an antigen-binding region that is highly variable, even when the same gene segments are recombined. V(D)J recombination allows for the generation of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors to antigens that neither the organism nor its ancestor(s) need to have previously encountered, allowing for an adaptive immune response to novel pathogens that develop or to those that frequently change (e.g., seasonal influenza). However, a major caveat to this process is that the DNA sequence must remain in-frame in order to maintain the correct amino acid sequence in the final protein product. If the resulting sequence is out-of-frame, the development of the cell will be arrested, and the cell will not survive to maturity. V(D)J recombination is therefore a very costly process that must be (and is) strictly regulated and controlled.

The ZX8301 is IC22 on the QL motherboard. The Sinclair Research business model had always been to work toward a maximum performance to price ratio (as was evidenced by the keyboard mechanisms in the QL and earlier Sinclair models). Unfortunately this focus on price and performance often resulted in cost cutting in the design and build of Sinclair's machines. One such cost driven decision (failing to use a hardware buffer integrated circuit (IC) between the IC pins and the external RGB monitor connection) caused the ZX8301 to quickly develop a reputation for being fragile and easy to damage, particularly if the monitor plug was inserted or removed while the QL was powered up. Such an action resulted in damage to the video circuitry and almost always required replacement of the ZX8301. The ZX8301, when subsequently used in the International Computers Limited (ICL) One Per Desk featured hardware buffering, and the chip proved to be much more reliable in this configuration.

He served as U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador (1926‚Äì1928), Colombia (1928‚Äì1933), Cuba (1934‚Äì1937), Brazil (1937‚Äì1944), France (1944‚Äì1949), and Egypt (1949‚Äì1955). Early life Caffery was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, to Charles Duval Caffery and Mary Catherine (n√©e Parkerson) Caffery. He was privately educated in primary and secondary school. He was a member of the first graduating class of Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute, which later became the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He also graduated with a bachelor's degree from Tulane University in 1906. He was admitted to the Louisiana bar in 1909. Caffery was the cousin of U.S. Senator Donelson Caffery and U.S. Representative Patrick T. Caffery. Career Caffery launched his career of international diplomacy in 1911 when he entered the Foreign Service as second secretary of the legation in Caracas in 1911 during the William Howard Taft administration. He traveled to Iran (then named Persia) in 1916, to Paris after World War I with President Wilson‚Äôs peacemakers, then to Washington, D.C., to arrange details for visits by the King of Belgium and the Prince of Wales. In 1920, he was named second-in-command at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid. In 1933, Caffery briefly served as assistant secretary of state under Cordell Hull. Throughout his career he also had worked in lower-ranking diplomatic posts in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Japan, Persia, Sweden, and Venezuela. =Service in Colombia= As the U.S. ambassador to Colombia, Jefferson was heavily involved in the Banana Massacre that occurred in 1928 in the small, coastal town of Ci√©naga. Tired of terrible working conditions and very little wages (workers were paid in United Fruit Company store credit), banana farmers went on strike in protest. In order to protect the interests of the United Fruit Company, Caffery reported to U.S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg that leaders of the strike would be immediately arrested and sent to prison in nearby Cartagena. Martial law was declared soon after and an unknown number of workers and their families were shot by a firing squad in the town square.Koeppel, D. (n.d.). Banana : The fate of the fruit that changed the world. New York: Hudson Street Press. After the banana massacre he wrote, a dispatch from U.S. Bogot√° Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated December 29, 1928, \\"I have the honor to report that the legal advisor of the United Fruit Company here in Bogot√° stated yesterday that the total number of strikers killed by the Colombian military authorities during the recent disturbance reached between five and six hundred; while the number of soldiers killed was one.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20020726204104/http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/caffery29dec1928.htm =Service in Cuba= In 1934, while ambassador to Cuba, four assailants attempted to assassinate Caffery in front of his home in Havana. The assailants waited outside of his residence for his daily departure to his yacht club. One assailant was killed by a bodyguard, the others escaped. Caffery was not hurt. The event was reported on the front page of the New Orleans Times Picayune, dated May 28, 1934. =Service in Egypt= After his appointment to Cairo in 1949, there was a coup d'etat headed by a junta of Egyptian army officers that led to the abdication of King Farouk on July 23, 1952. The junta was headed by Mohammed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, who demanded the departure of the British from the Suez Canal zone. Caffery served as intermediary between the Egyptian and British Governments in the negotiations, and his \\"long experience in diplomacy, together with the respect in which he was held by the Egyptian Government, enabled him to arrange for the gradual departure of the British.\\" In 1954, the British agreed to evacuate their military bases in the Canal Zone until the summer of 1956, but were given the right to return in case of an attack by an outside power against an Arab League member state or Turkey. In total, he worked 43 years in foreign service under eight U.S. presidents: Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, F. D. Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower. Personal life On November 20, 1937, Caffery, then 41 years old, married Gertrude McCarthy of Evansville, Indiana, while in Rio de Janeiro. They had no children. He retired with his wife in 1955 to reside in Rome, where he was the honorary private chamberlain to Popes Pius XII, Pope John XXIII, and Paul VI. He returned to Lafayette in 1973, shortly before Mrs. Caffery's death on July 13, 1973. Caffery himself died on April 14, 1974. The Cafferys are buried behind St. John‚Äôs Cathedral in Lafayette. Honors and awards He was awarded the Foreign Service Cup in 1971 by his fellow Foreign Service officers. He held several honorary degrees and decorations, including the Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, in 1954. He received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour from the president of France in 1949 and the Order of the Cordon of the Republic from the president of Egypt in 1955. Ambassador Caffery was also bestowed a knighthood in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM) by the Grand Master of that Order, for his outstanding service to the Catholic Church. A portion of Louisiana Highway 3073 in Lafayette is named the \\"Ambassador Caffery Parkway\\" in his memory. In 2000, Caffery was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

Together with his friend and business partner, Caspar Voght, he led one of the largest trading firms in the Hanseatic League during the second half of the 18th century. On 14 July 1790, the first anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, a freedom celebration organized by Sieveking occurred in Harvestehude, a neighborhood of Hamburg, which received attention far beyond the city. In 1796, a few years before his death, Sieveking succeeded in abolishing the 1793 Hamburg-imposed Embargoes against Paris. Family and early life His father's side of the family came from Westphalia, and his grandfather was Ahasver Hinrich (1668‚Äì1729) the First, who entered the merchant's trade by founding a business that specialised in trading linen in Versmold. His son Peter Niclaes (1718‚Äì1763) followed him in the cloth trade, but went to Hamburg, where he became a citizen in 1747. Only two years later he married Catharina Margaretha B√ºsch, the daughter of a wine merchant who had come to Hamburg from L√ºneburg, whose brother Georg Heinrich B√ºsch had risen to become a Senator of Hamburg. Her first son, born in 1751, was named after him. In accordance with family tradition, he was designated to enter the merchant business, which actually also suited him due to his mathematical talent. Together with his brother Heinrich Christian Sieveking, who was a year younger, he was taught by a private tutor, until both were sent to hear the mathematics lectures of Johann Georg B√ºsch at the Hamburg commercial academy in 1764. He married Johanna Margaretha Sieveking, the daughter of the physician, natural historian and economist Johann Albert Heinrich Reimarus. Their son, Karl Sieveking, was a Syndicus of Hamburg from 1820-1847.Joist Grolle: Sieveking, Karl. In: Hamburgische Biografie. Bd. 3, G√∂ttingen 2006, S. 361‚Äì363, hier: S. 361. The firm Voght & Sieveking Round letter from 1 July 1793 with Voght's announcement that he would retire from the firm. On 1 August 1766 Sieveking joined the firm of the Hamburg Senator Voght as an apprentice. During his apprentice period he proved himself so diligent that Voght granted him a stake in the firm in 1771, alongside his own son, Caspar. After the Senator's death in 1781, they both continued the business of the firm together, at first under the name \\"Caspar Voght & Co.\\", then, after 1788, as \\"Voght und Sieveking\\". By Sieveking's 40th birthday on 28 January 1791, Voght had granted him a third of all profits, later he granted him one half. On 1 July 1793, Caspar Voght transferred all activities to Sieveking, apart from the trade with America, and dedicated himself to other pursuits. Instead of concentrating on a specific sector of trade, Voght und Sieveking traded a wide range of goods, on the basis of a broad spectrum of clients. The focus of their import business was initially on the ports of the French Atlantic coast and of England, but already with the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, ships of the firm from the ports of the American East Coast laden with tobacco, rice and indigo arrived in the Hanseatic city. Voght stated of himself: \\"Ich war der erste Hamburger Kaufmann, der aus Mocca Kaffee, aus Baltimore Toback, aus Surinam Kaffee, aus Afrika Gummi holte\\" (\\"I was the first Hamburg businessman to bring coffee from Mocha, tobacco from Baltimore, coffee from Suriname, rubber from Africa\\"). It was Georg Heinrich Sieveking, however, who was the real driving force behind the business, which was run jointly until 1793. Whilst Voght crossed all of Europe on his extensive travels, his partner Sieveking took care of running the business in Hamburg mostly on his own. Voght himself underlined this fact, when he wrote in a letter to all business partners in July 1793 that his friend had been the sole decision-maker of the firm for some years (\\"le seul g√©rant de notre commerce\\"). Sieveking and the French Revolution =Friends and Freemasonry= From an early age, Sieveking had shown a great interest in literature. Alongside his childhood friends Johann Michael Hudtwalcker (born 1747) and Caspar Voght (born 1752) he composed poetry and prose, and performed plays with Hudtwalcker's sisters. Sieveking's wife Johanna Magdalena Sieveking (n√©e Reimarus) maintained a literary salon in Hamburg, which represented similar ideas. Some of the greatest role models of this circle around Sieveking were Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, whom they gushingly admired as the composer of the Messias. Sieveking further developed his Enlightenment ideas as a Freemason in the Hamburg Lodge \\"St. Georg zur gr√ºnenden Fichte\\" (\\"St George of the verdant spruce\\"), and became its Worshipful Master in 1789. In a speech at the Lodge on freedom he already in 1777 advanced a moderated concept of freedom: > \\"Lawlessness is precisely what freedom is not: Even the noble Architect of > the great Universe, the most free of all Beings, is governed in all His > actions by the eternal and immutable laws of beauty, wisdom and strength, of > order and harmony. He is free who is guided by sensible reasons and not by > outside force. Freedom in the state does not mean independence from the > laws, but safety from unreasonable laws and arbitrary interference in our > rights by the authorities.\\" > \\"Freiheit ist eben nicht Gesetzlosigkeit: Selbst der erhabene Baumeister des > gro√üen Weltalls, der das freieste aller Wesen ist, wird in jeder seiner > Handlungen durch die ewigen, unver√§nderlichen Gesetze der Sch√∂nheit, > Weisheit und St√§rke, der Ordnung und Harmonie regiert. Frei ist der, welcher > in seiner Wahl durch vern√ºnftige Gr√ºnde und nicht durch fremde Gewalt > bestimmt ist. Freiheit im Staate hei√üt nicht Unabh√§ngigkeit von den > Gesetzen, sondern Sicherheit vor unvern√ºnftigen Gesetzen und eigenm√§chtigen > Eingriffen der Obrigkeit in unsere Rechte\\". Sieveking and his friends saw their ideals put into practice when the French Revolution started in 1789, at least until the revolutionary idea of freedom was taken to absurd lengths by the Terreur of Robespierre. =Freedom celebration in Harvestehude= Whilst the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille was celebrated in Paris on the Champ de Mars, in Harvestehude in front of the gates of Hamburg a freedom festival took place, organized by Georg Heinrich Sieveking. The most prominent amongst the 80 guests were Adolph Freiherr Knigge and Sieveking's idol Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. :Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, painting by M. E. Vogel =Reactions= The celebration caused a furore far beyond the borders of Hamburg ‚Äì even the leader of the Girondists, Jacques Pierre Brissot, praised it in his \\"Patriot Fran√ßais\\" ‚Äì but remained without consequence for the political culture of Hamburg. The Senate of Hamburg did not take account of it, and Sauveur Joseph Gandolphe, the French charg√© d'affaires in Hamburg, declined to attend, claiming that \\"the celebration in Harvestehude could have led to the excitement of a population that was at this point the calmest in all of Europe\\". He even suspected merely commercial motives in Sieveking's and Voght's activities. The firm had greatly profited from grain exports to France, and Gandolphe suspected that the celebration of Harvestehude had merely been staged to please the French and pave the way for further exchanges. =An meine Mitb√ºrger= Execution of Louis XVI (engraving from 1793) After the Revolution in France had grown increasingly radicalised and the French King Louis XVI had been executed in January 1793, Sieveking came under increasing pressure in Hamburg. He finally countered the accusation that he was a Jacobin with an open letter with the title An meine Mitb√ºrger (\\"To my fellow citizens\\"), in which he strongly denied having been pleased at the King's death. At the same time he condemned the excesses of the Revolution as \\"anarchy, intrigues, disobedience of the law, irreligiosity, cruelty and murder\\", but did not declare himself fundamentally opposed to the principles of the Revolution, based on the ideas of the Enlightenment. His business partner Voght, on the other hand, went further: he later accepted the title of \\"Baron\\" and argued for a restriction of the freedom of the press. In a letter to Magdalene Pauli, Voght wrote soberly in 1794: \\"Wie ein entz√ºckender Traum schweben die Jahre 89 und 90 vor meiner Seele. Ich bin schrecklich erwacht.\\" (\\"The years 89 and 90 hover before my soul like a delightful dream. I have awakened terribly.\\") Special envoy in Paris =Imperial war, Le Hoc's expulsion and the embargo= When the War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797) against France was officially declared an imperial war (Reichskrieg), restrictions came into force for the trade between Hamburg and France. Specifically the export of grain and meat, which were vital for the war, was prohibited. A number of merchants ‚Äì including Sieveking ‚Äì attempted to circumvent this rule by transporting their goods to the Danish port of Altona, and shipping them to France from there. The relations between the Hamburgers and France, until then the city's most important trading partner by far, were still strong despite the prohibitions: this provoked the ire of Austria and its ally, Prussia. In February 1793 the Lower Saxonian circle, led by Prussia, and supported by the imperial envoy Binder von Kriegelstein, demanded the expulsion of the French envoy in Hamburg, Fran√ßois Le Hoc. At the end of 1792, he had founded a reading society in Hamburg with the journalist Friedrich Wilhelm von Sch√ºtz on the model of the Jacobin club of Mainz, of which Sieveking had been elected president, and for this reason alone was suspected of incitement. When the Hamburg Senate finally submitted to the pressure and expelled Le Hoc, he cancelled the trade treaty concluded between Hamburg and Paris in 1789 in his letter of protest. Furthermore, the National Convention ordered the confiscation of all Hamburg ships in French ports and imposed a trade embargo on the Hanseatic city. Although the embargo was subsequently imposed quite mildly by the French, and the Hamburg merchants continued to do everything they could to circumvent the German prohibition via Altona, the volume of trade between Hamburg and France declined drastically. =Sieveking in Paris= Sieveking Already in March 1795, the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce had therefore raised the idea of a special envoy to Paris, in order to reverse the embargo. Due to his high standing in Paris, Sieveking was the obvious choice, and he arrived in Paris as special envoy on the night of 31 March 1796 with his delegation, which included the President of the Hamburg Cathedral chapter Friedrich Johann Lorenz Meyer. There, a period of relative political stability had returned, after the crushing of the anti-revolutionary uprising of 13 Vend√©maire (5 October 1795) by Napoleon and Paul de Barras. On 12 April 1796 Sieveking was granted an audience with the French Directory, where a solution to the conflict could not be reached, however. His plan to support France's finances by raising the exchange rate for the mostly devalued assignats was rejected by the French as insufficient, and by the Hamburg Senate as impossible. On 27 April, Sieveking received 300,000 Marks from the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce to be used at his own discretion, and he did not hesitate in using it to bribe Barras and other powerful figures of the Republic. In May 1796, after a meeting with the French finance minister Dominique-Vincent Ramel-Nogaret, a fortunate turn of events occurred. The Directory ratified a treaty on 14 June 1796 which provided for the payment of 13 million livres, which Sieveking guaranteed personally. That same evening, Barras met with Sieveking, and told him: \\"Votre affaire est finie\\" (\\"Your business here is finished\\"). The official signing took place ten days later, and a worried Sieveking wrote to Hamburg the same day: \\"ob ich das Opfer meines Patriotismus sein werde, das werden meine Mitb√ºrger entscheiden\\" (\\"whether I shall be the victim of my own patriotism, that will be for my fellow citizens to decide\\"). But his fears proved unfounded. On his return in July 1796, Sieveking was received with honours. In his report before the assembled members of the chamber of commerce he said that this moment was one of the finest and most important of his life and claimed: \\"Ich schw√∂re es bei Ihrer Achtung, bei meiner Ehre, ich habe Hamburg gerettet\\" (I swear by your esteem, by my honour, I have saved Hamburg\\"). Death On 25 January 1799, Georg Heinrich Sieveking died suddenly and unexpectedly. Wilhelm von Humboldt wrote in a letter: \\"The memory of the deceased will surely remain unforgettable amongst all his friends, and surely few have had the good luck to be so generally and sincerely pitied and missed\\". The firm of Sieveking was only able to survive the great Hamburg trade depression of 1799 with difficulty, but then went bankrupt in the course of the Continental System and was dissolved in April 1811.

In partnership with a number of local NGOs and international development and financial institutions, as well as the governments of Kenya and Tanzania, Honey Care undertakes village-level demonstrations and provides microfinance, training, and community-based extension services. Honey Care also provides a guaranteed market for the honey produced by small-holder farmers at fair trade prices. It collects the honey at the farm gate and pays for it on the spot, then processes, packs and sells the honey for a profit through supermarket chains and other industrial clients. Its \\"Honey Care Africa\\" and \\"Beekeeper's Delight\\" brands are well known in the East Africa region and have captured a significant market share. Area of operation In 2004, with support from the Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation and a patient capital loan from the International Finance Corporation, Honey Care expanded its operations beyond the borders of Kenya and successfully replicated its model in Tanzania. It has been working since 2013 in South Sudan. Today Honey Care Africa employs close to 50 staff and has helped over 9,000 small-scale beekeepers (representing over 38,000 direct beneficiaries) earn a supplementary income of $180‚Äì250 per annum. For many, the income earned from honey production often makes the difference between living below or above the poverty line. Honey Care Africa is the largest producer of high quality honey in East Africa and among the largest exporters of beeswax in the Region. Mission and agenda From its inception, Honey Care Africa had an explicit triple bottom-line agenda, with an emphasis on generating economic, social, and environmental value simultaneously through its activities. In many ways, Honey Care was set up as an experiment in trying to challenge and redefine the traditional role of the private sector in development and to radically reconfigure the dynamics between the private sector, the development sector, and rural communities. This led to the evolution of Honey Care‚Äôs \\"Tripartite Model,\\" which seeks to develop a synergistic \\"win-win-win\\" partnership between these three key actors by drawing on the core competencies of each. Awards and recognition Honey Care Africa and its founders have received numerous international awards for their work, including: *the Equator Initiative Prize at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002) *the International Development Marketplace Innovation Award in partnership with Africa Now from the World Bank & Soros Open Societies Institute (2002) *the World Business Award from the Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum and United Nations Development Programme (2004) Honey Care also received the coveted \\"Kenya Quality Award\\" in the Small and Medium Enterprise Category from the Kenya Bureau of Standards (2004) and was named the \\"Top Small to Medium Sized Business in Africa\\" for 2005-06 at the SMME Awards in South Africa. It also received \\"First Prize in the Renewable Energy and Environment Category\\" at the same event. Honey Care Africa has been featured on numerous occasions in the press and media including in the BBC, the Chicago Tribune, The Globe and Mail, Financial Times, CNBC Europe, CBC, UN Radio, Daily Nation, and East African Standard. It has been discussed in a number of academic journals, including the Stanford Social Innovation Review and the MIT Sloan Management Review, and has been featured in several books and other published academic works.

Introduction Famous Japanese cellist Hisako Onoda boards a supertanker en route to her concert in Rotterdam, as she is afraid to fly. The ship is trapped in the Panama Canal as a result of an international crisis and anchors in Gatun Lake. Hisako is Banks' first female lead character (he uses others in Whit and The Business). Banks himself did not rate the book very highly: > \\"I always worry, with all these things. Canal Dreams was my first attempt at > a political thriller - an action book. As a political thriller it's not very > good and a sign that it's not so good at what it's supposed to be doing is > that it would be so easy to take the politics out and make a pro-CIA > propaganda movie. If it's that easy to strip out, the political element, I > haven't done my job properly. When asked about possible film rights in an interview, Banks replied: > \\"Och yeah. At the moment there's some interest in Canal Dreams although I > think I could only sell it to Oliver Stone, anybody else doesn't have the > clout not to get shoved off the picture and they'd just make it and turn it > into American CIA propaganda. ...

Make a film > like Die Hard and cut out most of the first half of the book.\\" Plot summary The plot is fairly simple. In the first half, when the ship is stranded but unharmed, the mood is bucolic and philosophical, and the main challenge Hisako has is to pass the time in a tropical lake. She has an affair with one of the ship's officers and they go scuba diving together. She practises the cello. She is worried about the future, and has violent nightmares and flashbacks to her early life in Japan. She also spends time with the other passengers, among them a South African engineer and an erudite Egyptian. In the much darker second half, the book becomes an almost Die Hard- like thriller. Guerrillas (who turn out to be agents provocateur) take over the ship. The rebels kill everybody aboard except Hisako and rape her. She avenges herself, killing the pirates. The violence of the rebel takeover and of Hisako's revenge is described very graphically.

It was subdivided into 16 kharub (caroub), each of 13 fals (burbe). The fals was further subdivided into 6 qafsi (burben). The nasri (asper) was worth 2 fals. The denomination was often either not given on coins or only indicated by a numeral. Some rial denominated coins have a numeral over the Arabic letter r, ÿ±. History The rial was issued by the Ottoman rulers of Tunis. Although known as the piastre by Europeans, it was not equal to the Turkish kuru≈ü, also known as the piastre. From 1855, the rial was on a bimetallic standard of 1 rial = 0.17716 grams pure gold or 2.7873 grams pure silver. In 1887, the gold content of the 25 rial coin was slightly reduced to make it equivalent to 15 French francs. In 1891, this conversion rate (more conveniently expressed as 1 rial = 60 centimes) was used when the Tunisian franc replaced the rial. Coins In the early 19th century, copper 1 fals coins were issued, together with billon 1 nasri, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kharub, 1 and 2 rial, and gold sultani. A new coinage was introduced in 1847, consisting of copper 1 fals, 1 nasri, ¬Ω and 1 kharub and silver 2 and 5 rial denominations. Between 1856 and 1858, copper coins for 3, 6 and 13 nasri were issued along with silver 2, 4 and 8 kharub, 1, 3 and 4 rial, and gold 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80 and 100 rial. The gold coins were initially struck in pure gold, later reduced to .900 fineness, with the 20, 40 and 80 rial denominations short-lived. The 6 and 13 nasri coins were later overstamped with the Arabic numerals \\"1\\" and \\"2\\" (\\"Ÿ°\\" and \\"Ÿ¢\\") to indicate that they were to circulate as 1 and 2 kharub coins, an increase in value of ¬Ω nasri for the 6 nasri coin. In 1864, a new copper coinage was introduced in denominations of ¬º, ¬Ω, 1, 2, 4, 8 kharub. Silver 8 kharub and gold 5 rial were also introduced. In 1887, the slightly smaller 25 rial coins were introduced (see above), with the additional inscription \\"15 F\\" to indicate the equivalence to the French franc.

It is located on Highway 561, approximately east of Calgary and south of Drumheller.  History  Hussar was unofficially founded in 1913 when the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) established a station and named it Hussar. A community grew up around the station and was incorporated as a village in 1928. The name Hussar for the station was used in honour of a group of German soldiers who belonged to a German Hussar (cavalry) regiment who earlier had established a large farm near Hussar. With the start of World War I most of the soldiers returned to Germany and those who remained were interned for the duration of the war. The land, which was part of this German Canadian Farming Co. Ltd., was purchased after the war. Following the war, the community, both the village and the surrounding area, began to grow with an influx of settlers from around the world. English, Irish, Scots and Danes made up the bulk of the settlers. Many of those settlers' descendants still reside in or around the community.The Hussar Heritage, , by The Hussar Historical Society Book Committee - 1994, Page 19 - 25  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Hussar recorded a population of 190 living in 78 of its 87 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 176.

He was mostly active near Forl√¨. Biography Palmezzano was born and died in Forl√¨, Romagna. After his initial training with the painter Melozzo da Forl√¨ ‚Äî who had collaborated with Piero della Francesca and was widely esteemed as a master of perspective and foreshortening techniques‚Äî Palmezzano went to Rome in the early 1490s. It is rumored that Palmezzano may have then traveled to Jerusalem to join the team painting frescoes at the Holy Cross church there, but no documentary evidence exists. He is, however, noted in property records as residing in Venice in 1495. Shortly thereafter, Palmezzano returned to Forl√¨, where he spent the rest of his long life‚Äîapparently with only brief excursions connected with commissions in other places in the region‚Äîuntil his death in 1539.

Work Palmezzano's studio was prolific in producing altarpieces, most commonly featuring the iconic arrangement of an enthroned Virgin with child on her lap, while below, symmetrically sited in the foreground are flanking saints. Venetian painting, in general, and the work of Giovanni Bellini and Cima da Conegliano, in particular, were to remain the most powerful influences on Palmezzano's output. Moreover, he remained faithful to the Venetian style of the later 15th and early 16th century. Mannerism entirely passed him by, and he seemed immune to subsequent developments in Venetian painting. One of the most attractive facets of Palmezzano's oeuvre are the distinctive and suggestive landscapes that form the backdrops of many of his altarpieces. These are a blend of the ideal and lyrical, and of the observed reality of the Apennine foothills and mountains to the south of Forli for which Palmezzano clearly had a real affection. These landscapes are also employed to subtle and imaginative effect to convey the symbolic religious messages of the works.

It houses the Deaconess's Institute of Kaiserswerth where Florence Nightingale worked Kaiserswerth has about 7,000 inhabitants and an area of 4.71 km2.  History  Ruin of the Kaiserpfalz in Kaiserswerth. left About the year 700 the monk Saint Suitbert founded a Benedictine abbey at Werth, a river island that formed an important crossing point of the Rhine. The abbey was destroyed 88 years later. On that area there is now the \\"Erzbisch√∂fliches Suitbertus-Gymnasium\\", an archiepiscopal secondary school with the old chapel and parts of the abbey. The former monastery garden is a meeting point for the upper school between lesson times. The Kaiserpfalz which is a general term for a temporary seat of the Holy Roman Emperor was built at an unknown date but before the year 1016. In 1062, the archbishop of Cologne, Anno II, kidnapped the underage German King Heinrich IV from here and in this way obtained the unofficial regency of the Holy Roman Empire. At this time the island's name changed from Werth to Kaiserswerth. In 1174, Friederick I Barbarossa moved the Rhine customs collection to Kaiserswerth. The eastern branch of the Rhine around the island silted up connecting Kaiserswerth to the east bank of the river. In 1273, the emperor pledged Kaiserswerth to the Archbishop of Cologne forming a de facto enclave within the Duchy of J√ºlich-Berg. In 1591, Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld was born in Kaiserswerth. left Due to its strategic position the town changed regularly. The town was captured in 1586 during the Cologne War, and then occupied by the Spanish from 1589 to 1592. In 1636 the town was captured again by the forces of Hesse. When in 1688 the Elector of Cologne made an alliance with Louis XIV during the War of the Grand Alliance he gave the French access to the Rhine crossing at Kaiserswerth. This caused the Dutch and Brandenburg to lay siege to the town in the June 1689. The French garrison surrendered at the end of the month when their supplies were destroyed by fire. The French reoccupied Kaiserswerth in 1701 during the War of the Spanish Succession and the Allies laid siege to it again in 1702. After a long and hard struggle the town surrendered and the Alliance decided to demolish the fortifications.http://www.fortified-places.com/kaiserswerth In the 19th century Kaiserswerth was chiefly noted for its deaconess clinic, founded by local pastor Theodor Fliedner. Florence Nightingale worked there for some months meeting Paulina Irby. Another noted student was the Swedish Maria Cederschi√∂ld, a pioneer of nursing in her country.A Maria Cederschi√∂ld, urn:sbl:14717, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av O.

He is chair of Toll NZ, New Zealand's largest transport company. From its creation until February 2011 he was CEO of one of Australia's largest transport companies, Asciano Limited, and he is now CEO of the transport firm McAleese.  Biography  His father, Peter Rowsthorn, was formerly chairman of Toll Holdings. Along with Paul Little, Peter Rowsthorn bought the company in 1986. Because he holds nearly 10% of the company's shares, Mark Rowsthorn has an estimated net worth of over A$700 million, and Forbes magazine named him as the 36th-richest person in Australia and New Zealand in 2006. Forbes.com (2006). Australia & New Zealand's 40 Richest. Retrieved 2 June 2006. When Asciano Limited was separated from Toll in June 2007, Rowsthorn became CEO and managing director of Asciano. He had to relinquish his interests in Toll Group as part of the break-up. In February 2011 Asciano's chairman announced the surprise replacement of Rowsthorn by John Mullen, saying that the company needed a different leader for its next phase of growth. In March 2014 it was announced that Rowsthorn would replace Paul Garaty as CEO of the transport firm McAleese. Rowsthorn was reported to own almost 30 per cent of McAleese, which had been the subject of criticism about its poor safety record. Rowsthorn is passionate about horse racing and was a part-owner of the thoroughbred \\"Baughaust\\". His brother is the actor and comedian Peter Rowsthorn.  Savoy Tavern reopening  Rowsthorn owns the Savoy Tavern on the corner of Spencer and Bourke streets in Melbourne. It was closed for twenty years and becoming increasingly derelict, at one time being described by Melbourne Lord Mayor Robert Doyle as a \\"scab\\" on the city. Rowsthorn originally refused to do anything to improve the property, so Doyle said he would resort to a personal appeal to Rowsthorn to allow Melbourne City Council to demolish the building and install a park. However, it was reported in May 2013 that the tavern would be renovated and reopened as a bar, with a caf√© attached. The reopening took place in March 2014.

Hillside Engineering Group is a trading division of the rail operator KiwiRail in Dunedin, New Zealand. Most of its work is related to KiwiRail, but it also does work for the marine industry in Dunedin. On 19 April 2012 KiwiRail announced it was putting Hillside on the market for sale. In November 2012 KiwiRail announced it had sold part of the business to Australian firm Bradken, and the rest would be closed. The workshops continued to be used for some maintenance work by Kiwirail with a skeleton staff. In October 2019, the New Zealand Government announced that it would be investing NZ$20 million into revitalising Hillside Engineering as a major mechanical hub and engineering facility to service Kiwi Rail's locomotives and rollingstock. History Scotch marine-type steel boiler for the steamship , built by Hillside Railway Workshops in 1933 Hillside was founded as the Hillside Workshops of the New Zealand Railways Department in 1901, though workshops had existed close to the current site in South Dunedin since 1875. The workshops were extensively enlarged in the late 1920s, and by 1935 employed 800 workers, compared with 365 workers in 1925. At that stage they were the largest railway workshops in the South Island, covering . By 1945 staff numbers had been reduced to 550. The workshops, in Hillside Road, were one of South Dunedin's biggest employers and most imposing structures. One of the ends of the nearby Carisbrook sports ground is known as \\"The Hillside End\\" or \\"The Workshops End\\" due to the presence of the stadium's larger neighbour. =Passenger Car Projects= During 2003 Hillside won the contract to refurbish several old retired Queensland Rail SX cars, that were purchased from the Zig Zag Railway in Australia. The project lasted 14 weeks, after which the refurbished cars were sent to Auckland, where they are used on commuter trains, with a DBR diesel locomotive at each end. In 2004, Hillside started work on rebuilding imported British Rail Mark 2 passenger cars for use in Auckland on commuter trains. The cars were stripped and rebuilt, for use in a push-pull consist, with a cab control car at one end (classed SD), with several standard cars (classed SA) in between and a diesel locomotive providing motive power at the other end (either a DC or DFT). A diesel generator which provides on board electrical power is fitted into a noise insulated compartment in each SD car. The SA/SD rebuilding project ended in 2010. In 2009 KiwiRail announced that Hillside Engineering had won the contract to build 17 new passenger cars for its two South Island long distance passenger trains, the TranzAlpine and the Coastal Pacific, classed AK. Part of the project also includes converting 6 existing AG vans into 2 open-air viewing vans and 4 luggage vans. In November 2011, the new cars entered service on the Coastal Pacific. =Sale and closure= In November 2012 KiwiRail announced it had sold part of the business to Australian firm Bradken, and the rest would be closed. Ninety jobs were lost. The opposition Labour Party said the sale was a \\"political decision\\", but KiwiRail said there wasn't enough work to keep the workshop operating. Hillside had earlier lost a contract to build new wagons for KiwiRail after it was revealed that it was not competitive and would not be able to deliver the wagons within the time frame specified. KiwiRail said they intended to allocate some work to the new owners, while other work was to be done at the company's Hutt workshops near Wellington. =2019 Upgrade and Re-opening= In the intervening years, Hillside Engineering's workshops continued to be used for some locomotive and wagon maintenance work by KiwiRail with a skeleton staff for overflow work from the KiwiRail Hutt Railway Workshops and maintenance and conversion work on South Island rolling stock. On 30 October 2019, Regional Development Minister Shane Jones announced that the Government would be investing $20 million into re-establishing Hillside workshop as a mechanical hub and heavy engineering facility to service KiwiRail's locomotives and rolling stock. This investment involves upgrading the two main workshop buildings and overhauling the mechanical plant.

Early life Mayer Hillman was born in northwest London in 1931, the third son of David Hillman, a portrait painter and stained glass artist, and Dr Annie Hillman, a general practice physician (GP). He and his brothers were raised in West Hampstead, by their Scottish Jewish parents, and in Rickmansworth during the WWII bombing raids. He studied at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London and practiced as an architect for several years, before seeking a change in direction. He completed a PhD on transport, planning and environmental issues in 1970 at the University of Edinburgh, without a scholarship and supporting a young family with his wife Heidi Krott. Career Established at the PSI, a policy thinktank, Hillman became eclectic contributor to debates on transport, the environment and health. Several of his contrarian arguments and studies have been proven accurate with the passage of time. For example, he co-authored a 1990 study, One False Move, which equated the reduction in child casualties on British roads in recent decades with the loss of freedom that they have experienced because of the increase in traffic, with repercussions for child health.One False Move ... a study of children's independent mobility, Policy Studies Institute, Hillman et al, Several of his innovations, like raised-level intersections to slow traffic, have later been adopted in policy and planning. He believes public policy should be more socially and environmentally conscious, and has been an animated speaker on a variety of topics, in his later years completing two books and promoting action on climate change. A strong proponent of personal carbon trading, he specifically helped develop the concept of personal carbon allowances. Hillman has been a lifelong cyclist, arguing against compulsory helmet laws in 1992, and in favour of cycling's health promotion possibilities in a British Medical Association report in 1992. Hillman has not flown for more than 20 years as part of his commitment to reducing carbon emissions. But he is now scornful of individual action which he describes as \\"as good as futile\\", rhetorically asking \\"can you see everyone in a democracy volunteering to give up flying? Can you see the majority of the population becoming vegan? Can you see the majority agreeing to restrict the size of their families?\\" He believes that, \\"Even if the world went zero-carbon today that would not save us because we've gone past the point of no return.\\" He announced his withdrawal from speaking and writing on climate change and other topics in late 2017, with these statements. Personal life He married Heidi Krott in 1964, and they have two sons, Josh (born 1968) and Saul (born 1970). Works * Hillman, M, T. Fawcett and S.C. Rajan. 2007.

Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he ranked among the Negro Leagues' career leaders in batting average, home runs, RBI and slugging percentage (.587). Standing 6-foot-3, and weighing upwards of 220 pounds, John Beckwith was one of the mightiest sluggers to ever take the field. Over a 16-year career (1918-34), the big righty, swinging his signature 38-inch bat, routinely batted over .400 against official Negro League competition. In 1927, he unofficially bashed 72 home runs against all-comers (he hit 54 HRs in 1928). Pitcher Scrip Lee, who faced both men, declared that \\"Babe Ruth and Beckwith were about equal in power.\\" The legendary Ted \\"Double Duty\\" Radcliffe claimed that \\"nobody hit the ball any farther than [Beckwith]‚ÄîJosh Gibson or nobody else.\\" Babe Ruth himself said that ‚Äúnot only can Beckwith hit harder than any Negro ballplayer, but any man in the world.‚Äù Beckwith, who played with such noted teams as the Chicago Giants, Baltimore Black Sox, Homestead Grays, and Lincoln Giants, was often overshadowed by Oscar Charleston, who twice topped him by a single longball for the league home run crown. Though he played nearly every position on the diamond, including pitcher, the rifle-armed Beckwith was best known as a third baseman. According to Baseball-Reference.com, three of his best offensive seasons in league play were 1925 (.407 with 16 HRs and 42 RBI in 46 games), 1930 (.471 with 20 RBI in 22 games), and 1931 (.364 with 11 HRs and 30 RBI in 30 games). If you breakdown Beckwith's league stats into modern 162 game intervals, he would average .347 with 205 hits‚Äîincluding 37 doubles, 10 triples, and 27 homers‚Äî107 RBI, and 118 runs scored per season. A dead-pull hitter, Beckwith had one of the quickest bats around. In fact, opposing defenses sometimes employed an over-shift on the infield‚Äîa rare occurrence versus a righty. In 1921, the 19-year-old became the first basher to hit a ball over the laundry roof behind Crosley Field. Years later, he hit a 460-foot blast in Griffith Stadium; the ball would've gone farther had it not been stopped by a 40-foot high sign. Beckwith, who Turkey Stearnes called \\"one of my favorite ballplayers,\\" made his last known Negro League appearance in 1938. Beckwith died in New York City, six days before his 56th birthday.

Together with his business partner and friend Georg Heinrich Sieveking he led one of the largest trading firms in Hamburg during the second half of the 18th Century. On numerous trade trips, he completely crossed the European continent. One of his greatest achievements was reforming the welfare system of Hamburg. From 1785 he dedicated himself to strengthening agricultural and horticultural projects and built a model agricultural community in Flottbek, close to the gates of Hamburg. Life and work =Background, youth and 'Grand Tour' of Europe= Caspar Voght was born in Hamburg, the first of three children of the family of the merchant and senator Caspar Voght (the elder, *1707 in Beverstedt close to Bremen, ‚Ä† 1781 in Hamburg) and Elisabeth Jencquel (* 26 September 1723), the daughter of a Hamburg senator. Voght's father was apprenticed around 1721 in the merchant house J√ºrgen Jencquel which specialized in Hamburg's trade with Portugal. For 16 years starting in 1732 he represented the merchant house in Lisbon. After he returned, Voght's father founded his own silk and linen trading company in Hamburg and later rose to the rank of senator in Hamburg. At the age of 12, Caspar Voght fell seriously ill of smallpox which left permanent facial scarring. Other than making friends with Georg Heinrich Sieveking, whom he met as an adolescent in the Kontor of his father's firm, Voght was more inclined at this point in his life to dedicating himself to studying literature, politics, and science, and found little pleasure in his vocation as a merchant. When his father wanted to send him to Lisbon at the age of twenty for his education, Voght used his mother's fears of Lisbon to avoid going. She had lost two brothers in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Voght instead embarked in 1772 on a Grand Tour of Europe. His journey took him, among other locations, to Amsterdam, London, Paris and C√°diz. He reached Madrid, where he concluded a trade agreement for his father's business. After traveling through the south of France, Voght went to Switzerland, where he met Lavater and Haller. In Geneva he made contact with Voltaire. Passing through Turin, Milan, Parma and Bologna, he arrived in Rome where he was presented to Pope Pius VI. After a side trip to Pompeii, Naples, and a short stop in Venice, Voght traveled to Bergamo, where he made contact with the local silk weavers for his father's business. He then went to Vienna, Dresden, Berlin and Potsdam, finally returning to his hometown of Hamburg in 1775. =Trading Activity and Establishment of the Model Estate in Flottbek= Voght's country house in Klein-Flottbek, steel engraving by L. Wolf (1805) After the death of his father in 1781, Voght continued his father's company under the name \\"Caspar Voght & Co.\\" in partnership with Georg Heinrich Sieveking. Together, they made use of the newly independent English colonies to build up strong mercantile ties with traders in ports along the North American coast. A good will missive dated March 29, 1783 was presented to Congress in Philadelphia on behalf of the Hamburg Senate by Johann Abraham de Boor. De Boor was a citizen of Hamburg who had traveled overseas under commission to the trading firm of Caspar Voght & Co. Georg Heinrich Sieveking, Coloured copper engraving by P. M. Alix, Paris Voght's interests lay more with agriculture than with trading. Even as a youth, he was delighted being in a garden, designed on a French model, which his father owned in Hamm, at the outskirts of Hamburg. As Voght became older, he became aware that his inclination for landscape architecture and horticulture would be more than a hobby, and life in business repelled him increasingly. Not long before his death, Voght acknowledged in a letter: \\"When trade could no longer strike my fancy, I became nauseous\\". He handed the direction of the firm over to his partner Sieveking in a large measure. From 1785, Voght began to purchase lots of land in Klein Flottbek outside the gates of the then independent city of Altona. After a trip to England in the winter of 1785-6, where he tried to familiarize himself with the local landscape architecture and modern methods of husbandry, he began work on his Hamburg estates on a model farm and arboretum (the present day Jenisch Park was his parc du midi). Voght recruited two landscape gardeners for Flottbek renowned in Europe: the Scotsman James Booth and Frenchman Joseph Ram√©e. In 1787, Voght introduced the potato for cultivation. Up until then, it had been primarily an import product from the Netherlands. In 1797 he helped his stewart Lukas Andreas Staudinger found an institute for education in agriculture in Gro√ü Flottbek. It was the first agricultural school in the German-speaking world. The most prominent student of this academy was Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen, who would later correspond with Voght primarily about questions of crops yields of soils. =Voght as poor house reformer= B√ºsch, Voght, G√ºnther, Sieveking (Stahlstich von L. Wolf, 1805) As early as 1770 Voght had come in contact with prisons, when, representing his father, he had shown the English prison reformer John Howard around Hamburg's penitentiary. From that time he maintained a great interest in matters related to poorhouses and prisons. Together with the head of the trade academy (Handelsakademie) Johann Georg B√ºsch and the lawyer Johann Arnold G√ºnther, Voght initiated in 1788 the establishment of a 'common institution for the poor' (Allgemeinen Armenanstalt) with which he reformed Hamburg's poor provision. The foundation of this reform was the division of the city into care zones whose approximately 200 inhabitants were entrusted with finding voluntary means of caring for the poor in that zone. The institute guaranteed medical attention for the poor, support during pregnancy and childbirth, and education and work for poor children. In contrast to the prevailing mode of providing for the poor, which was usually ecclesiastical and focused on moral and spiritual aspects of the situation, the reform was directed towards the economic needs of those affected. The cost of the effort was met by tithes collected in churches and weekly collections for the poor. As a result of this effort, the number of occupants in Hamburg's penitentiaries sank drastically. Voght's success in the fight against poverty had effects throughout Hamburg and beyond. In 1801, the Emperor summoned him to Vienna, in order to suggest remedies and help prepare plans for a reform of the poor provisions in that city. For this service, he granted the title of baron (Reichsfreiherr) and was thereby ennobled. During a stay in Berlin in the winter of 1802-03, Voght authored a review about poor provision in Berlin at the request of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III. During a many-month stay in Paris in 1807, he prepared a report commissioned by the French interior ministry on the situation of the Parisian poorhouses, orphanages, maternity houses, and prisons. Beyond these, he reformed poor provision in Marseille and Lyon, and communicated his understanding of reform to Lisbon and Porto. In 1838 at the age of 86, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Hamburger poor institute, he wrote a book entitled Reflections on the 50 Year History of the Poor Institute (Gesammeltes aus der Geschichte der Armenanstalt w√§hrend ihrer 50j√§hrigen Dauer). =The later years= Caspar Voght. Lithograph by Johann Joachim Faber By 1793 Voght had handed over all business affairs with the exception of trade with the US to his Partner Sieveking. The trade crisis which hit Hamburg in 1799 struck his firm heavily, so that he finally had to dissolve the trade house. During the period of the Continental System he undertook another multi- year trip through Switzerland, France, and Italy, during which he got to know the Emperor Napoleon and his first wife Josephine in Paris. After his return to Flottbek he lived mainly from income earned from agriculture. Upon the sale of his model estate to the banker and senator Martin Johann Jenisch in 1828, Voght lived with Bonaparte. He later dwelt with the widow of his partner Georg Heinrich Sieveking, who had died in 1799. Voght died in Hamburg on 20 March 1839 at the age of 86. He was buried in the Nienstedtener cemetery. In celebration of Caspar Voght Two streets in Hamburg are named after Caspar Voght: Baron-Voght-Stra√üe in Klein-Flottbek and Caspar-Voght-Stra√üe in Hamm. There was also a secondary school named after him, the coeducational Caspar- Voght-Gymnasium (formerly an Oberrealschule for girls only) at Caspar-Voght- Stra√üe. The school has been converted and today is the home of the ballet school of Hamburg run by John Neumeier. References =Primary sources= * Caspar Voght: Lebensgeschichte.

Edward died two years later, leaving a widow and infant daughter. Holding the position of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent, among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of rules for the upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak-willed and utterly dependent upon them in the hope of allowing them one day to wield power through her. Princess Victoria grew to hate Conroy, thanks to the oppressive system, and he was also unpopular among the rest of the British royal family. His efforts to place the Duchess in the role of regent were ultimately unsuccessful, as Victoria ascended the throne after reaching her majority in 1837. Conroy was immediately expelled from Victoria's household, though he remained in the Duchess of Kent's service for several more years. Given a pension and a baronetcy, Conroy retired to his estate near Reading, Berkshire, in 1842 and died heavily in debt twelve years later. Historians have often referred to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, with varying degrees of positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it. Early life Conroy was born on 21 October 1786 in Maes-y-castell, Caerhun, Caernarvonshire, Wales. He was one of six children born to John Ponsonby Conroy, Esq., and Margaret Wilson, both native to Ireland. His father was a barrister and the younger Conroy was privately educated in Dublin. On 8 September 1803, he was commissioned in the Royal Artillery as a Second Lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 September. In 1805, Conroy enrolled in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He made his career during the Napoleonic Wars, though his ability to avoid battle attracted disdain from other officers. Conroy did not participate in the Peninsular War or the Waterloo Campaign. Further advancement of rank was facilitated with Conroy's marriage to Elizabeth Fisher on 26 December 1808 in Dublin, though not as far as Conroy felt he deserved. Elizabeth was the daughter of Colonel (later Major-General) Benjamin Fisher and Conroy served under him in Ireland and England while performing various administrative duties. Conroy was promoted to Second Captain on 13 March 1811 and appointed adjutant in the Corps of Artillery Drivers on 11 March 1817. Conroy and Elizabeth had six children together: * Sir Edward Conroy, 2nd Baronet (6 December 1809 ‚Äì 3 November 1869), married Lady Alice Parsons, daughter of Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse. They were the parents of the analytical chemist Sir John Conroy, 3rd Baronet. * Elizabeth Jane Conroy (1811‚Äì1855). * Arthur Benjamin Conroy (1813‚Äì1817). * Stephen Rowley Conroy (15 August 1815 ‚Äì 1841), served with the Coldstream Guards. * Henry George Conroy (4 June 1817 ‚Äì 5 October 1890), served with the Grenadier Guards, aide-de-camp to the commander of the forces in Ireland. * Victoria Maria Louisa Conroy (12 August 1819 ‚Äì 9 February 1866), married Sir Wyndham Edward Hanmer, 4th Baronet. Employment with the Kents Conroy's relationship with the Duchess of Kent (pictured) was subject to rumours that they were lovers. Through the connection of his wife's uncle, Conroy came to the attention of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Conroy was appointed as an equerry in 1817, shortly before the Duke's marriage to Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. An efficient organiser, Conroy's planning ensured the Duke and Duchess' speedy return to England in time for the birth of their first child. The child was Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, later Queen Victoria. While Kent had promised Conroy military advancement, he was still a captain by the time of the Duke's death in 1820. Conroy was named an executor of the Duke's will, though he was unsuccessful in persuading the dying man to name him Victoria's guardian. Aware that he needed to find another source of revenue quickly, Conroy offered his services as comptroller to the now-widowed Duchess of Kent and her infant daughter. He retired from military service on half-pay in 1822. =Kensington system= Together in a hostile environment, Conroy's relationship with the Duchess was very close, with him serving as her comptroller and private secretary for the next nineteen years, as well as holding the unofficial roles of public relations officer, counsellor, confidant and political agent. While it is not clear which of the two was more responsible for devising the Kensington System, it was created to govern young Victoria's upbringing. An elaborate and oppressive system of rules regulating every facet of Victoria's life, it kept her in reclusive isolation most of the time, with the goal of making her weak, compliant and utterly dependent upon her mother and Conroy. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage. Aware of the reasons behind King George IV's unpopularity, Conroy promoted a public image of the Duchess that was pure, modest and decorous, while at the same time increasing her paranoia against the British royal family, particularly the Duke of Cumberland. Princess Victoria soon came to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her economical habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have stemmed from a personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition may also have been influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society. Conroy effectively barred Victoria from anyone other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently came into contact with were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria does not appear to have been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals. The young princess depended on her devoted governess Louise Lehzen, who defended her against Conroy's machinations. As Victoria grew older, attempts were made by Conroy and the Duchess to secure Lehzen's removal, or at least the lessening of her influence. Such tactics proved unsuccessful, as the princess became more devoted to Lehzen than before, as evident in her journals. Early in his stay at Kensington Palace, Conroy made an effort to become close to Princess Sophia, an elderly sister of George IV who also resided at the palace. Sophia is described by Christopher Hibbert as an \\"impressionable and mentally unstable woman\\", and Conroy had little difficulty in persuading her to let him take control of her finances. In return for making Sophia a member of the Duchess's social circle, the princess reported back to Conroy on activities at St. James's Palace and Kensington when he was absent. =Victoria as heir presumptive= Princess Victoria, 1833. She grew up in the controlling Kensington System devised by her mother and Conroy. In 1827, the Duke of York died, making the Duke of Clarence heir presumptive and Victoria second-in-line to the throne. Conroy complained that the princess should not be surrounded by commoners, leading King George IV to appoint Conroy a Knight Commander of the Hanoverian Order and a Knight Bachelor that year. The Duchess and Conroy continued to be unpopular with the royal family and, in 1829, the Duke of Cumberland spread rumours that they were lovers in an attempt to discredit them. The Duke of Clarence referred to Conroy as \\"King John\\", while the Duchess of Clarence wrote to the Duchess of Kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from the royal family and that she must not grant Conroy too much power. The Duke of Clarence became King William IV in 1830, by which point Conroy felt very confident of his position; his control of the household was secure. The Duchess prevented her daughter from attending William's coronation out of a disagreement of precedence, a decision attributed by the Duke of Wellington to Conroy. By then, it had become clear to Victoria that she would succeed to the throne. The new king and queen attempted to gain custody of their niece, but Conroy quickly replied that Victoria could not be \\"tainted\\" by the moral atmosphere at court. Conroy solidified the stance that mother and daughter could not be separated, and continued to promote the Duchess' virtue as a fit regent. As King William intensely disliked the Duchess and Conroy, he vowed to wait until Victoria came of age to die simply to keep them from a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess and her daughter. Aware that a regency was becoming increasingly unlikely, Conroy and the Duchess began promoting the view of Victoria as a \\"weak-minded, frivolous and foolish\\" girl in need of guidance. While increasing their bullying of the princess, they implied that Victoria desired a regency even if she succeeded later than her majority at eighteen. Victoria was forbidden to be alone with her beloved Lehzen; either the Duchess's ally Lady Flora Hastings or a Conroy sister (now appointed as companions) were required to accompany her. In 1835, Victoria became seriously ill of typhoid fever on the last of the royal tours. Exploiting her weakened state, the Duchess and Conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document; this document would have appointed Conroy her personal secretary upon her accession. Victoria emerged from the incident more determined than ever to become self-reliant. Her increased intransigence alarmed the Duchess. At her behest, family adviser Baron Stockmar investigated, recommending to the Duchess that she dismiss Conroy and make peace with her daughter. But Conroy easily convinced the Duchess to ignore Stockmar's advice. Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty-one. =Victoria in power= Victoria's ascension to the throne in 1837 led to Conroy's banishment from her household. The king died just weeks after Victoria's eighteenth birthday and she succeeded him as sovereign. Conroy was the subject of numerous discussions Victoria had with Stockmar on the first day of her reign. At the same time, Conroy created a list of demands to give to Stockmar with the intent that he pass them on to Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. Conroy demanded \\"a pension of ¬£3,000 a year, the Grand Cross of the Bath, a peerage and a seat on the Privy Council.\\" Victoria left the negotiating to Melbourne, who agreed to most of Conroy's demands, most likely to avoid a scandal. On the advice of Melbourne, Conroy was granted a baronetcy and a pension of ¬£3,000 per annum. This did not satisfy Conroy, who continued in the following years to petition Victoria for an Irish peerage. Each request was refused, as the peerage would have enabled him to attend court. One of Victoria's first acts as queen was to dismiss Conroy from her own household, though she could not dismiss him from her mother's. Queen Victoria, as an unmarried young woman, was still expected to live with her mother, but she relegated the Duchess and Conroy to remote apartments at Buckingham Palace, cutting off personal contact with them. The Duchess unsuccessfully insisted that Conroy and his family be allowed at court; Victoria disagreed, saying: \\"I thought you would not expect me to invite Sir John Conroy after his conduct towards me for some years past.\\" In 1839, the Duke of Wellington convinced Conroy to leave the Duchess's household and take his family to the Continent in effective exile. The Times reported that he no longer had official duties, though they were unsure if he had resigned or been dismissed. That year rumours abounded that Lady Flora Hastings, whose abdomen had grown large, was pregnant by Conroy. A subsequent medical investigation concluded that Lady Flora was a virgin and she died from liver cancer several months later. This scandal, in tandem with the Bedchamber Crisis, damaged Victoria's reputation. In 1842, Conroy settled at his family home in Arborfield Hall near Reading, Berkshire and became a gentleman farmer, winning prizes for his pig breeding. He founded the Montgomery Regiment of Militia in 1849. Despite his pensions and ownership of properties and lead mines in Wales, Conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 March 1854 at Arborfield. His eldest son Edward succeeded him to the baronetcy. After his death, the Duchess of Kent finally agreed to open her financial accounts and acknowledged that significant funds were missing. She was moved to admit that Conroy had swindled her while at the same time hurting her relationship with Victoria for his own benefit. A rapprochement followed between mother and daughter. Finances of Princess Sophia Princess Sophia's substantial income, provided from the civil list, had allowed Conroy to enjoy a wealthy lifestyle. The princess died in 1848, leaving only ¬£1,607 19s 7d in her bank accounts despite a lifestyle of savings and low expenses. The Duke of Cambridge and the Duchess of Gloucester had a lawyer write to Conroy demanding that he account for the rest of their sister Sophia's funds, but Conroy simply ignored it. According to Flora Fraser, the most recent biographer of George III's daughters, Princess Sophia had in fact personally spent huge sums on Conroy, including heavy contributions to the purchase prices of his residences and supporting his family in a style he judged appropriate to their position. Conroy ultimately received ¬£148,000 in gifts and money from Sophia. In 1850, the Duchess of Kent's new comptroller, Sir George Couper, studied the old accounts. He found huge discrepancies. No records for her household or personal expenses had been kept after 1829. There was also no record of nearly ¬£50,000 the Duchess had received from her brother, Leopold, nor of an additional ¬£10,000 from William IV. Historiography After Conroy's departure from Victoria's service in 1837, a popular song read: Following his death in 1854, The Times published a positive obituary that declared \\"the name, person and character of Sir John Conroy are so well and, in many respects, so favourably known in British society that we have no doubt the announcement of his death will be received with feelings of general regret\\". The article briefly summarised his lifetime and praised Conroy for \\"considerable shrewdness, no small knowledge of human nature and a very winning address\\" as well as \\"devoting himself with great zeal and assiduity\\" to members of the royal family. Described in his own lifetime as a \\"ridiculous fellow\\", Conroy has not been the recipient of much recent positive historical opinion. Twentieth-century historian Christopher Hibbert writes that Conroy was a \\"good-looking man of insinuating charm, tall, imposing, vain, clever, unscrupulous, plausible and of limitless ambition.\\" For her part, 21st-century historian Gillian Gill describes Conroy as \\"a career adventurer, expert manipulator and domestic martinet\\" who came to England with \\"small means, some ability and mighty ambition.\\" In 2004, Elizabeth Longford wrote that Conroy \\"was not the arch-villain Victoria painted, but the victim of his own inordinate ambition.\\" =Suspected lover of the Duchess= Conroy's relationship with the Duchess was the subject of much speculation both before and after his death in 1854. When the Duke of Wellington was asked if the Duchess and Conroy were lovers, he replied that he \\"supposed so\\". In August 1829, Wellington reported to court diarist Charles Greville that Victoria, then ten years old, had caught Conroy and her mother engaged in \\"some familiarities\\". Victoria told her governess, Baroness Lehzen, who in turn told Madame de Spaeth, one of the Duchess's ladies-in-waiting. De Spaeth confronted the Duchess about the relationship and was immediately dismissed. All of this was recorded by Greville; his subsequent diary entry has led to the persistent belief that the Duchess and Conroy were lovers. Later, as an aged Queen, Victoria was aghast to discover that many people did indeed believe that her mother and Conroy were intimate and stated that the Duchess' piety would have prevented this. =Rumour that Conroy was Queen Victoria's father= The subject of Victoria's paternity has been a matter of debate, with candidates ranging from the Duke of Kent (pictured) to John Conroy. During Victoria's lifetime and after her death in 1901, there have been rumours that Conroy or someone else, and not the Duke of Kent, was her biological father. Historians have continued to debate the accuracy and validity of these claims. In his 2003 work The Victorians, biographer A. N. Wilson suggests that Victoria was not actually descended from George III because several of her descendants had haemophilia, which was unknown among her recognised ancestors. Haemophilia is a genetic disease that impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting, which is used to stop bleeding when a blood vessel is broken; it is carried in the female line but the symptoms manifest mostly in males. Wilson proposes that the Duchess of Kent took a lover (not necessarily Conroy) to ensure that a Coburg would sit on the British throne. Likewise, medical historian W. T. W. Potts considers it a possibility that the Duchess took a lover under pressure from her brother Leopold. He cites the rarity of genetic mutations as evidence, as well as the \\"remarkable\\" circumstances surrounding Victoria's conception. Potts makes no mention of Conroy specifically, only that the father would have been a haemophiliac himself or would have had a mutated gene. Haemophilia B has been known to arise spontaneously in the children of older fathers, and the Duke of Kent was fifty-one when Victoria was born. Nicholas Wright Gillham proposes that the haemophilia mutation could have first occurred with either Victoria or the Duke of Kent. Gillian Gill and her son Christopher, an infectious disease specialist, also view a genetic mutation as the most likely possibility; Gillian Gill writes that \\"a few historians in recent years have found it seductive\\" to doubt Victoria's stated paternity because a random mutation is \\"an unexciting solution\\". Helen Rappaport concurs, remarking that \\"the best and most logical\\" explanation is that haemophilia first appeared in Victoria as a mutation. Alan Rushton adds that no one in the household of the newly married Duchess of Kent, including Conroy, is known to have had haemophilia, and that her probable awareness of the scandals surrounding the behaviour of Caroline of Brunswick and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain would have deterred her from seeking an affair elsewhere. Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III. There is evidence that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think it could have been bi-polar disorder),http://www.medicaldiscoverynews.com/shows/292-george.html most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease probably affected her grandfather, George III and this could give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation that one of her great-great- grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family. In popular culture Conroy has been portrayed numerous times in film and television. Herbert Wilcox's Victoria the Great (1937) depicted Conroy as a \\"smarmy character\\" who is not well developed in the film. The baronet was played by Stefan Skodler in 1954's The Story of Vickie, and Herbert H√ºbner in M√§dchenjahre einer K√∂nigin (1936). Patrick Malahide played Conroy in Victoria & Albert, a 2001 TV miniseries that depicted Victoria's early influences. English actor Mark Strong played him in the 2009 film The Young Victoria. The film depicts Conroy as a maniacal controlling pseudo-father to the young Victoria during the year preceding her accession even going so far as depicting him assaulting the princess twice. The film goes on to depict Conroy's expulsion from Queen Victoria's household. Conroy also appears in numerous historical fiction novels about Queen Victoria. Writing under the pen names Jean Plaidy and Eleanor Burford, author Eleanor Hibbert published a series of novels in the 1970s and 1980s, which included The Captive of Kensington Palace (1972), The Queen and Lord M (1973) and Victoria Victorious: The Story of Queen Victoria (1985). A. E. Moorat released the parody novel Queen Victoria: Demon Hunter in 2009. Patrilineal descent Conroy was descended from the √ì Maolconaire family of Elphin, County Roscommon.

He attended Agua Fria Union High School in Avondale, Arizona. After high school, he attended Fresno State and Arizona State University. Gilbert was drafted four times by three different teams-the Dodgers, Reds and Twins, however it was not until their second try the Twins were able to finally sign him in 1987. The 5'9\\", 185 pound Gilbert was not too imposing (some sources say he was as small as 170 pounds), but he held his own in the minors by using his small stature to swipe 40 or more bases in 3 out of 4 seasons between 1988 and 1991. He also hit .372 in 43 at- bats with Visalia in 1988. Gilbert, who batted and threw right-handed, made his major league debut on June 2, 1997. Over the next few years, he bounced between the majors and minors but ended up swiping only 2 bases in 51 total major league games while hitting just .149. An interesting fact about Gilbert's MLB career is in 51 games he only had 47 at-bats and scored more runs than he had actual hits. Rarely for someone to appear in 50 or more career games does anyone have more runs than hits and more games than at-bats. Two other examples of this are Charles Gipson and Glen Barker. His last major league game was July 2, 2000, with the Dodgers. He ended up retiring from professional baseball in 2003 at the age of 38 after playing for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes in , then in the Dodgers and Pirates farm systems in 2001, 2002, and 2003.

It is one of Sofia's symbols and primary tourist attractions. \\"Sofia, Bulgaria\\", Mihail Dyuzev, Hitotoki.org, 2010, web: Hito-4 . The St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia occupies an area of and can hold 5,000 people inside. It is believed to be among the 10 largest Eastern Orthodox church buildings. It is the third largest Orthodox Cathedral located in Southeast Europe, being surpassed only by two new and not yet fully completed Cathedrals - the Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest, and the Church of Saint Sava in Belgrade. It is believed that until year 2000 it was the largest finished Orthodox Cathedral. Architecture 200px The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is a cross-domed basilica featuring an emphasized central dome.

The construction of the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral started in 1882 (having been planned since 19 February 1879), when the foundation stone was laid, but most of it was built between 1904 and 1912. Saint Alexander Nevsky was a Russian prince. The cathedral was created in honour to the Russian soldiers who died during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, as a result of which Bulgaria was liberated from Ottoman rule. The cathedral was designed by Alexander Pomerantsev, aided by Alexander Smirnov and Alexander Yakovlev, as the initial 1884-1885 project of Ivan Bogomolov was radically changed by Pomerantsev. The final design was finished in 1898, and the construction and decoration were done by a team of Bulgarian, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and other European artists, architects and workers, including the aforementioned architects, as well as Petko Momchilov, Yordan Milanov, Haralampi Tachev, Ivan Mrkviƒçka, Vasily Bolotnov, Nikolay Bruni, Alexander Kiselyov, Anton Mitov and many others. Interior The marble parts and the lighting fixtures were created in Munich, the metal elements for the gates in Berlin, while the gates themselves were manufactured in Karl Bamberg's factory in Vienna, and the mosaics were shipped from Venice. Name changes The name of the cathedral was briefly changed to the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral between 1916 and 1920 (since Bulgaria and Russia belonged to opposing alliances in World War I), but then the initial name was restored. The St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was consecrated on 12 September 1924 and in 1955 was declared a cultural monument. Relics To the left of the altar is a case displaying relics of Alexander Nevsky, given by the Russian Orthodox Church. Although the accompanying Bulgarian-language plaque refers simply to \\"relics\\" (–º–æ—â–∏), the item on display appears to be a piece of a rib. Museum and market parliament behind. There is a museum of Bulgarian icons inside the cathedral crypt, part of the National Art Gallery. The church claims that the museum contains the largest collection of Orthodox icons in Europe. Nearby locations The cathedral is adjacent to St. Sofia Church, the church for which the city of Sofia is named. Other notable landmarks in the immediate vicinity of the cathedral are the Monument to the Unknown Soldier, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the National Gallery of Foreign Art, the National Art Academy, the Bulgarian Parliament, a park honoring Ivan Vazov with his monument and gravestone, the Sofia Opera and Ballet, and a park where one can buy handmade textiles, icons, and antiques in a small flea market.

Prehistory Archaeological investigations have discovered that the fort location was a site of the Pre-Columbian Marksville culture dating back to circa 300 CE, with continued occupation afterwards. A large shell midden was used as the base under the early Colonial fort. The fort The Colonial era fort protected the Lake Pontchartrain entrance of Bayou St. John. The first small fort here was erected by the French in 1701, before the founding of the city of New Orleans, to protect the important trade route along Bayou St. John. After Louisiana passed to Spanish control, a larger brick fort was constructed at the site of the neglected old French fortification; this was known as San Juan del Bayou. Louisiana passed back to France and then to the hands of the United States. The fort was decommissioned in 1823. From fort to amusement park The land was bought by private developers, and became a popular amusement park, known as \\"Spanish Fort\\" or \\"Old Spanish Fort\\". It featured restaurants, a casino, a resort hotel, dancing pavilions, an alligator pond, and in its later decades amusement rides such as the \\"Scenic railway\\", a roller coaster. A steam railway, and later an electric streetcar system, connected the lakeside resort with the center of the city. It was especially popular during the summer for the cooling breezes of the Lake. It was billed as the \\"Coney Island of the South\\". From about 1880 to 1908 the small iron submarine now in the collection of the Louisiana State Museum was on display here, identified as the Confederate war submarine \\"Pioneer\\". (Recent investigations have called the traditional identification into question, making the curious early submarine even more of a mystery; see: Bayou St. John submarine.) A 1919 newspaper advertisement brags \\"14,880 people visited the Spanish Fort last Sunday ‚Äì there was no congestion ‚Äì and everybody wore a smile.\\" \\"Over the Rhine\\", a German restaurant and beer garden was a popular attraction, as were dances by Paoletti's Orchestra. Tranchina's Restaurant and Brown's Ice Cream Parlor often featured live bands. The park had two cabarets, \\"Tokyo Gardens\\" and \\"The Frolics\\". In the park's later decades, a number of early jazz bands played here. Armand J. Piron's New Orleans Orchestra was a regular; Papa Celestin's band filled in while Piron was in New York. Pianist Steve Lewis performed not only with Piron's band, but also did solos and duets with singer New Orleans Willie Jackson. Johnny Bayersdorffer's Jazzola Novelty Orchestra and Johnny Miller's New Orleans Frolicers were also regulars. End of the amusement park Starting in the late 1920s, a project reclaimed land from Lake Pontchartrain, extending the shoreline out away from the old fort. The city's main amusement park became Pontchartrain Beach. In 1938, the location was converted into a public park. The name ‚Ä≥Spanish Fort‚Ä≥ was used because the only thing known about its history at the time was that it had been built by the Spanish. The site of Spanish Fort, mostly a brick ruin, can still be seen along the upper side of the Bayou just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, adjacent to what is now the \\"Floral Park\\" section of the Lake Vista neighborhood.

His great uncle, the tenor Carlo Negrini, created the role of Gabriele Adorno for Giuseppe Verdi, in the premiere of Simon Boccanegra in Venice in 1857. Throughout his youth, Negrini used to say that he had been born in Milano as a tribute to his father who had always lamented that none of his four sons had been born in Italy. Although he spent time there as a child and in subsequent years, he was actually born at the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in California, and considers himself a proud Angeleno. He attended St Casimir's Elementary School, Daniel Murphy High School, and USC Opera Workshop, all in Los Angeles. Gualtiero Negrini conducting Jerry Hadley with the Opera Orchestra of Los Angeles in 1994 Conducting Gualtiero Negrini began his studies at a very early age as a pianist and conductor under former Berlin Philharmonic conductor Fritz Zweig, and Dr. George Dawson of California State University, Long Beach. He conducted his first performances at the age of 13, a two-piano performance of Madama Butterfly with a small local amateur opera company. In his subsequent teen years, he continued conducting productions with full orchestra of Don Pasquale, Faust, and Lucia di Lammermoor. In the early 1990s, he co-founded the Opera Orchestra of Los Angeles,Cariaga, Daniel, \\"Marketing the Opera Orchestra Music: Founder Gualtiero Negrini leads the ensemble's first season of concert opera\\", Los Angeles Times, June 7, 1993 conducting critically acclaimed performances of Puccini's Turandot with Metropolitan Opera stars Ghena Dimitrova and Giuliano Ciannella. With the same orchestra, Negrini also conducted Verdi's Attila, and An Evening with Jerry Hadley ‚Äì a gala concert featuring the Metropolitan Opera tenor Jerry Hadley. He would go on to conduct Los Angeles productions of Tosca, La Boh√®me, Madama Butterfly, and Carmen. In 2000, Negrini conducted and produced the popular recording, Broadway Classic, featuring the renowned musical theater soprano, Lisa Vroman.Wiegand, David, \\"Phantom's Vroman Takes Center Stage\\", San Francisco Chronicle, August 22, 1999 In 2010, he was approached to be the resident conductor of the Opera Arts Festival in Palm Desert, California, a post he held for six seasons. Vocal Coach Negrini is also an internationally respected vocal coach. He began with the USC Opera Workshop, after being offered a position as a repertoire coach there at the tender age of 16, and has maintained private teaching studios in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Through the years, he has coached Metropolitan Opera singers Thomas Hampson, Suzanna Guzman, tenor Raul Hernandez, and many others. He also coached actress and Jazz singer Bettina Devin of the movie Rent, Franc D'Ambrosio of The Godfather Part III fame, TV and stage star Nancy Dussault, Broadway singing actresses Lisa Vroman, Aneka Noni Rose, Rachel Eskenazi-Gold, Karen Morrow, and the Tony Award-winning Dame Edna. A 20-year-old Gualtiero Negrini with Sharon Graham rehearsing Il Barbiere di Siviglia at Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1980 Singing Negrini made his singing debut at age 15, as Dr. Malatesta in a production of Don Pasquale mounted by a small company known as L'Opera Comique of Los Angeles that was founded by his father. At the age of 17, he made his tenor debut as Paolino in USC Opera's production of Il Matrimonio Segreto. Soon afterward, at age 19, he became a finalist in the 1980 Lyric Opera of Chicago auditions. There, he was mentored by Walter Baracchi, the noted pianist-conductor who had been with Lyric Opera of Chicago for a decade, and previously with Milan's La Scala since the late 1950s. This launched a professional singing career for Negrini. In Chicago, he would go on to share the stage, and learn from Luciano Pavarotti, Mirella Freni, Alfredo Kraus, Jon Vickers, and scores of other notables. Among his most successful performances were his portrayal of the \\"rock star\\" Nanki-Poo in Peter Sellars's updated production of The Mikado, and his rendition of Don Ramiro in the Gian-Carlo Menotti production of La Cenerentola at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. ‚Äì a role he would eventually perform over 100 times with many different opera companies. During this period he also performed the role of David in Die Meistersinger with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Erich Leinsdorf. He made history at Lyric Opera of Chicago when in 1982, at the age of 21, he replaced G√∂sta Winbergh as Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte, making him the youngest tenor ever to sing a leading role there.[1] Negrini has also been a finalist in the 1984 San Francisco Opera Auditions, where he was a member of the Merola Opera Program. In the late 1980s, while continuing to sing throughout the United States, in such roles as Hoffman in The Tales of Hoffman, Lord Percy in Anna Bolena and Dick Johnson in La fanciulla del West, he was approached by Hal Prince to re-create the role of Ubaldo Piangi in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera for its Los Angeles premiere.Marill, Alvin H. and Leonard, William T., More Theatre: M-Z, Scarecrow Press, 1993, p. 934 This would take Negrini through 8 years and over 3,000 performances of that role, in both Los Angeles and San Francisco. With noted soprano Lisa Vroman he sang the role of Martin in Aaron Copland's The Tender Land for the Cabrillo Music Festival in 1999,Cabrillo Music Festival, Biography:Gualtiero Negrini and in 2000 they both sang in A Gala Vienna New Year's Eve with the San Francisco Symphony under conductor Yves Abel. In March 2010 he played Tony in Frank Loesser's The Most Happy Fella to great acclaim with the Silicon Valley Symphony (formerly San Jose Symphony), once again with Lisa Vroman as his Rosabella.

It was built to a design by Mikhail Preobrazhensky in a typical Russian Revival style between 1894 and 1900, during the period when the country was part of the Russian Empire. The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is Tallinn's largest and grandest orthodox cupola cathedral. It is dedicated to Saint Alexander Nevsky who in 1242 won the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus, in the territorial waters of present-day Estonia. The late Russian patriarch, Alexis II, started his priestly ministry in the church. Interior of the Cathedral. The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral crowns the hill of Toompea which is one of several places where according to legend the Estonian folk hero Kalevipoeg's father Kalev is said to have been buried. As the USSR was officially non-religious, many churches including this cathedral were left to decline. The church has been meticulously restored since Estonia regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Construction and Interior Landscape view of the Cathedral, as seen from the top viewing platform of St. Olaf's Church, Tallinn. Detail on exterior depicting Nevsky The cathedral domes Religious mosaics The cathedral is richly decorated and has eleven bells cast in Saint Petersburg, the largest of which weighs about 16 tons, more than the other ten combined. It has three altars, with the northern altar dedicated to Vladimir I and the southern to St. Sergius of Radonezh. The base of the building is Finnish granite. In the five onion domes, gilded iron crosses are seen. Inside are three gilded, carved wooden iconostases, along with four icon boxes. The icons of the iconostasis and icon boxes were painted in St. Petersburg on copper and zinc plates. The windows are decorated with stained glass. Demolition plans The cathedral was built during the period of late 19th century Russification and was so disliked by many Estonians as a symbol of oppression that the Estonian authorities scheduled the cathedral for demolition in 1924, but the decision was never implemented due to lack of funds and the building's massive construction.

It is named after Wilhelm Sinning (1792‚Äì1874), a gardener of the Botanische G√§rten der Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universit√§t Bonn.Genaust, Helmut (1976). Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen There are about 65 species of tuberous herbaceous perennials, all occurring in Central and South America, with the greatest concentration of species occurring in southern Brazil. Sinningia incarnata The best-known species, Sinningia speciosa, was originally introduced in cultivation as Gloxinia speciosa and is still commonly known to gardeners and in the horticultural trade as \\"gloxinia\\", although this is now considered incorrect. The true genus Gloxinia is distinguished by having scaly rhizomes rather than tubers. Sinningia species often grow on rocks or cliffs and most are pollinated by hummingbirds or bees but Sinningia brasiliensis is bat- pollinated, and Sinningia tubiflora, with large, powerfully fragrant tubular white flowers, is apparently pollinated by sphinx moths. Most of the species have large, brightly colored flowers. Because of this, numerous species and numerous hybrids and cultivars are grown as houseplants. A cultivar worth knowing is Sinningia x 'Lovely.' This beautifully gentle plant is a cross between Sinningia sellovii and Sinningia tubiflora. Its tall spikes and tubular flowers attract butterflies, and delight gardeners. Some species with particularly large tubers are cultivated by cactus and succulent enthusiasts as caudiciforms. One such example is Sinningia leucotricha, often listed under the older name Rechsteineria leucotricha and dubbed \\"Brazilian edelweiss\\" for its covering of silvery, silky hairs. Other species with large tubers are Sinningia iarae, Sinningia lineata, and Sinningia macropoda. Sinningia speciosa, flower about 5 cm across The Brazilian genera Paliavana and Vanhouttea, consisting of shrubby plants without tubers, are closely related to Sinningia and recent morphological and molecular analyses (Boggan 1991, Perret et al. 2003) suggest that these genera are, in fact, nontuberous Sinningia species. All three genera were included in tribe Gloxinieae in the classification system of Hans Wiehler but are now recognized in their own tribe, Sinningieae. Numerous genera, including Corytholoma, Rechsteineria and Lietzia, have been synonymized under Sinningia. Garden uses and cultivation Sinningias are attractive greenhouse plants and houseplants that appeal strongly to gardeners who like to specialize in particular plant groups. The chief environmental needs are warmth, high humidity, suitable soil and good light with shade from strong sun. The soil should be well drained.

Varna was held by the Ottoman army. An approach to Varna by Russian forces was first attempted on June 28, but the Russian avantgarde was met by significant Turkish forces, and the siege was postponed. Painting by Alexander Sauerweid (1836) By the end of July, the Black Sea Fleet under the command of Aleksey Greig approached Varna and delivered the landing forces. In mid-August the Guards Corps arrived at Varna, with Emperor Nicholas I. The siege was put under the command of Adjutant General Menshikov, with total forces of 23,000 personnel and 170 artillery pieces against the 20,000 garrison of Varna. When Menshikov was wounded the siege was entrusted to General Field Marshal Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov. In an attempt to relieve the siege of Varna, Omer Vryonis Pasha brought an army of 20,000 but was successfully held off. At the battle of Kurtepe the Russians under Prince Eugene attacked but they were defeated and retreated. However the Turks did not follow up this victory and waited 11 days at the place. In the meantime Varna capitulated. Eventually Varna was taken with 6,900 prisoners and 140 artillery pieces. The town was surrendered by Yusuf Pasha. However, the Russians suffered big losses during the summer-autumn campaign and withdrew from Varna and the Danube to resume the campaign in the following spring. The Russians had lost 6,000 men in the siege from battles and disease. References * Kersnovsky, Anton, History of the Russian Army, Belgrade, 1933‚Äì1936, reprinted by Golos, 1992-1994 .

The brand is best known for pioneering a new category of bodybuilding supplements known as meal replacement powders or MRPs. It was also involved in the androstenedione controversy in the late 1990s. Company Created by Scott Connelly, an anesthesiologist, the original MET- Rx product was intended to help prevent critically ill patients from losing muscle mass. Connelly's product was marketed in cooperation with Bill Phillips and the two began marketing to the bodybuilding and athletic communities, launching sales from the low hundreds of thousands to over $100 million annually.Epstein, David; Dohrmann, George. \\"What You Don't Know Might Kill You\\", Sports Illustrated, May 18, 2009. Connelly sold all interest in the company to Rexall Sundown for $108 million in 2000. MET-Rx is currently owned by NBTY. Products =Original MET-Rx MRP= The original MET-Rx meal replacement product came in two canisters‚Äîone labeled MET-Rx \\"base\\" and the other MET-Rx \\"plus\\". The instructions were to take two scoops of the plus and one scoop of the base and mix them in milk or water. As the product grew more popular, it was released as one formula combining the \\"base\\" and \\"plus\\" while removing the micellar casein component. As a result, the original METAMYOSYN blend is no longer used in MET-Rx products, as the current ingredients does not contain micellar casein. MET-Rx's meal replacements and protein powders contain a proprietary blend (known as METAMYOSYN) which consists of ingredients such as whey protein, calcium caseinate, egg albumen and milk protein isolate, combined with maltodextrin, vitamins, minerals and added amino acids. An NBC DateLine broadcast on October 6, 1996, entitled \\"Hype in a Bottle\\" investigated MET-Rx USA, Inc. The report revealed that MET-Rx had failed to provide published peer-reviewed documentation to substantiate its advertising claims. In October 1993 the \\"MET-Rx Substantiation Report\\" was provided to David Lightsey of the National Council Against Health Fraud. The report claimed association with Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas. The report noted that several Dallas Cowboys players had gained an average of 2.5 to 3 pounds of lean body mass weekly for six weeks when using a MET-Rx product -- an obvious red flag. Cooper Clinic was contacted of possible misrepresentation. Cooper Clinic issued a cease and desist letter to Met-Rx from the Cooper Clinic president and medical director. In February 1995, the Penn State Sports Medicine Newsletter (3;6) published a report titled \\"Is It Real or Is It Met-Rx?\\" that concluded, \\"MET-Rx ... claims of fat loss and increased muscle mass have not been proven by scientifically accepted methods.\\" The National Council Against Health Fraud discussed Met-Rx in several issues of their newsletter, pointing out that the scientific claims of the manufacturer were not based on scientific studies but on the endorsement on celebrities. Marketing MET-Rx currently features a wide variety of television sponsorships such as the MET-Rx World's Strongest Man competition and as of 2004 the company claimed the brand was endorsed by 50 top athletes. MET-Rx also sponsors dozens of athletes, bodybuilders, and celebrities, as well as being the primary sponsor of the World's Strongest Man competition. In early interviews and promotional materials, Connelly marketed himself as a 1973 Harvard Medical School graduate, and claimed he was on the faculty of Stanford Medical School between 1979 and 1986. However, Connelly was only at Harvard as a post-grad \\"special student\\" in the 1973-74 academic year. He then got his Doctor of Medicine in anesthesia from Boston University School of Medicine in 1978 and did a one-year Stanford fellowship in 1981.

Describing the land around the author's home in Sauk County, Wisconsin, the collection of essays advocate Leopold's idea of a \\"land ethic\\", or a responsible relationship existing between people and the land they inhabit. Edited and published by his son, Luna, a year after Leopold's death, the book is considered a landmark in the American conservation movement. The book has had over two million copies printed and has been translated into at least fourteen languages.The Aldo Leopold Foundation's site on the Almanac It has informed and changed the environmental movement and stimulated a widespread interest in ecology as a science. Overview A Sand County Almanac is a combination of natural history, scene painting with words, and philosophy. It is perhaps best known for the following quote, which defines his land ethic: \\"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\\" The original publication format was issued by Oxford University Press in 1949. It incorporated a number of previously published essays that Leopold had been contributing to popular hunting and conservation magazines, along with a set of longer, more philosophical essays. The final format was assembled by Luna Leopold shortly after his father's death, but based closely on notes that presumably reflected Aldo Leopold's intentions. Subsequent editions have changed both the format and the content of the essays included in the original. In the original publishing, the book begins with a set of essays under the heading \\"Sand County Almanac,\\" which is divided into twelve segments, one for each month. These essays mostly follow the changes in the ecology on Leopold's farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin. (There is, in fact, no \\"Sand County\\" in Wisconsin. The term \\"sand counties\\" refers to a section of the state marked by sandy soils). There are anecdotes and observations about flora and fauna reactions to the seasons as well as mentions of conservation topics. The second section of the book, \\"Sketches Here and There,\\" shifts the rhetorical focus from time to place. The essays are thematically organized around farms and wildernesses in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Some of these essays are autobiographical. \\"Red Legs Kicking,\\" for example, recounts Leopold's boyhood experience of hunting in Iowa. The seminal essay \\"Thinking Like a Mountain\\" recalls another hunting experience later in life that was formative for Leopold's later views. Here Leopold describes the death of a she-wolf killed by his party during a time when conservationists were operating under the assumption that elimination of top predators would make game plentiful. The essay provides a non-technical characterization of the trophic cascade where the removal of single species carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem.Leopold, Aldo Thinking Like a Mountain The book ends with a section of philosophical essays grouped together under the heading \\"The Upshot\\". Here Leopold explores ironies of conservation: in order to promote wider appreciation of wild nature and engender necessary political support, one encourages recreational usage of wilderness that ultimately destroys it. Musings on \\"trophies\\" contrasts the way that some need a physical specimen to prove their conquest into the wilderness, though photographs may be less damaging than a trophy head to be mounted on the wall. He suggests that the best trophy is the experience of wilderness itself, along with its character- building aspects. Leopold also rails against the way that policy makers need to find an economic motive for conservation. In the concluding essay, \\"A Land Ethic\\", Leopold delves into a more appropriate rationale for conservation. In \\"The Ecological Conscience\\" section, he wrote: \\"Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land.\\" Leopold felt it was generally agreed that more conservation education was needed; however quantity and content were up for debate. He believed that land is not a commodity to be possessed; rather, humans must have mutual respect for Earth in order not to destroy it. He philosophizes that humans will cease to be free if they have no wild spaces in which to roam. Leopold's home, Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Importance and influence In a 1990 poll of the membership by the American Nature Study Society, A Sand County Almanac and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring stand alone as the two most venerated and significant environmental books of the 20th century.\\"'Silent Spring' and 'A Sand County Almanac': The Two Most Significant Environmental Books of the 20th Century\\", Nature Study, v44 n2-3 p6-8 Feb 1991 The book was little noticed when published but, during the environmental awakening of the 1970s, a paperback edition turned into a surprise bestseller. It still sells about 40,000 copies a year.Book review by Donella Meadows, director of the Sustainability Institute and an adjunct professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College The book has had immense popular influence and has been described as: \\"one of the benchmark titles of the ecological movement\\", \\"a major influence on American attitudes toward our natural environment\\",Nature Writing: The Tradition in English, Finch, Elder, p.376 \\"recognized as a classic piece of outdoor literature, rivaling Thoreau's Walden\\".Reflections on A Sand County Almanac by Don H. Meredith The book has also had great influence on environmental thinkers: \\"along with Walden and Rachel Carson‚Äôs Silent Spring, one of the main intellectual underpinnings of environmentalism in America\\".StoryLines Midwest, David Long, Leopold, through his book, is citedRachel Carson, Aldo Leopold, and Deep Ecology as one of the founders of Deep Ecology. The book has \\"attracted such overwhelming attention from environmental philosophers as a source of inspiration and ideas\\".

The international works together on points of agreement to co- ordinate activity. Political internationals have increased in popularity and influence since their beginnings in the political left of 19th-century Europe as political activists have paid more attention to developments for or against their own ideological favor in other countries and continents. After World War II, other ideological movements formed their own political internationals in order to communicate among aligned parliamentarians and legislative candidates as well as to communicate with intergovernmental and supranational organisations such as the United Nations and later the European Union. Internationals also form supranational and regional branches (e.g. a European branch or an African branch) and maintain fraternal or governing relationships with sector-specific wings (e.g. youth or women's wings). Internationals usually do not have a significant role. Internationals provide the parties an opportunity for sharing of experience. The parties belonging to internationals have various obligations and can be expelled for not meeting those obligations. For example, during the 2011 Arab spring the Socialist International expelled the governing parties of Tunisia and Egypt for performing actions incompatible with values of this international.

It is located in the eastern part of the municipality. Gerresheim is much older than D√ºsseldorf itself, having been an independent city with a rich history for over 1,000 years. Gerresheim merged voluntarily with D√ºsseldorf in 1909. The borough had 28,209 inhabitants and covered 6.47 square kilometersWebsite of the City of D√ºsseldorf: Short overview on the borough of Gerresheim (German) as of December 31, 2007. History In 870, a frankish nobleman named Gerricus founded the church of the women's collegiate foundation (Stift) of St. Margaret's (Gerresheim Abbey). In 1368, the Count of Berg made the village of Gerresheim surrounding the religious house a city with city rights. In the 17th century, many of the convent's aristocratic ladies moved away and the city of Gerresheim became increasingly impoverished. Soldiers raided Gerresheim during the Cologne War and later during the Thirty Years' War. The city's reputation suffered in consequence. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss abolished the abbey in 1803 and the Kingdom of Prussia took over Gerresheim in 1815. Ferdinand Heye founded the Gerresheimer Glash√ºtte 1864.

Although the film is short (26 minutes), it uses two radically different interpretations of the same events, a technique not unlike that used by Akira Kurosawa in Rashomon (1950), Errol Morris in The Thin Blue Line (1988), and Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus (2002). Hitchcock had offered his services to the British government after his former producer in the UK, Michael Balcon, made a statement about overweight British directors who had left the country for Hollywood \\"while we who are left behind short-handed are trying to harness the films to our great national effort.\\" Later, Hitchcock told Fran√ßois Truffaut \\"I felt the need to make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and overage for military service. I knew that if I did nothing, I'd regret it for the rest of my life; it was important to me to do something and also to get right into the atmosphere of war.\\" Hitchcock soon began development of Bon Voyage, which he described as \\"a little story about an RAF man who is being escorted out of France through the Resistance channels. His escort was a Polish officer. When he arrives in London, the RAF man is interrogated by an officer of the Free French Forces, who informs him that his Polish escort was really a Gestapo man. Upon that startling revelation, we go through the journey across France all over again, but this time we show all sorts of details that the young RAF man hadn't noticed at first, various indications of the Pole's complicity with the Gestapo detail. At the end of the story there was a twist showing how the Polish officer had been trapped. At the same time, the RAF man learned that the young French girl who'd helped them, and had spotted the Pole as a spy, had been killed by him.\\"LoBianco, Lorraine \\"Bon Voyage (1944)\\" (article) TCM.com Hitchcock cast John Blythe in the lead role, and the remaining members of the case came from the Moli√®re Players, who had escaped from France after the German invasion, and whose names were not revealed so as to protect their relatives still in France. Bon Voyage was filmed from 20 January to 25 February at Associated British Studios. Hitchcock was paid ¬£10 a week. It is uncertain whether Bon Voyage - which was a disappointment as a propaganda film to the Ministry of Information - was ever shown in Britain or in France. It and Aventure malgache were shelved by the Ministry and were not seen again until the 1990s,Mankiewicz, Ben (March 20, 2016) Outro to the Turner Classic Movies presentation of Bon Voyage when they were restored by the British Film Institute. Plot The story is told in flashback, once from the perspective of the protagonist, and then a second time with a deeper understanding that is provided by the intelligence officer in London. A Scotsman, RAF Sgt. John Dougall (John Blythe), a downed Royal Air Force air gunner who was previously a prisoner of war, explains how he travelled with great difficulty through German-occupied France. He was accompanied most of the way by a companion who was another escaped prisoner of war, and they were both aided by various courageous Resistance workers. His companion gave him a letter to deliver once he reached London, supposedly a very personal and private letter. However, when we see the Intelligence officer's explanation of the same events, it becomes clear that the gunner's companion, who was supposedly helping him along, was in fact a Gestapo spy, who murdered several of the Resistance fighters and reported the rest to the authorities, and that the \\"personal letter\\" the gunner was going to deliver in London contains secret information that would have helped the enemy.

Comic books Maurer's lifelong association with the Three Stooges began about the time of his marriage to Joan Howard, the daughter of the comedy team's Moe Howard on June 29, 1947. In 1949, he produced two Three Stooges comic book issues for Jubilee, based on the short films the team was making for Columbia Pictures. In 1953, Maurer created the first 3-D comics, Three- Dimension Comics featuring Mighty Mouse, with his brother, Leonard Maurer, and Joe Kubert. Two three-dimensional Stooge comics were also issued in 1953. He returned to the Stooges in comic form in 1972 with Gold Key Comics' The Little Stooges, which ran for seven issues over the next two years. Films Maurer was associate producer of Space Master X-7 (1958), in which his father-in-law, Moe, had a minor role, and is credited with the creation of the CineMagic process used in the 1960 film The Angry Red Planet. Along with Moe, Maurer co- managed the Three Stooges after Columbia terminated their employment in 1957, and has credits in most of their later feature films. He produced The Three Stooges Scrapbook (1960), and wrote the screen stories and produced The Three Stooges Meet Hercules (1962), The Three Stooges in Orbit (1962), The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze (1963) and The Outlaws Is Coming! (1965), the last two of which he also directed. Maurer's son, Jeffrey Scott (Moe's grandson), can be seen in The Outlaws IS Coming!, credited as Jeffrey Alan, and The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze in the role of Timmy, credited as Geoffrey A. Maurer. Maurer himself can also be seen on camera as a TV cameraman in The Three Stooges Scrapbook and as a camper in 1970's Kook's Tour, which he also directed. Kook's Tour was intended to be a comedy-travelogue television series featuring the Stooges, but Larry Fine suffered a stroke during production of the pilot episode and the series was cancelled; several years later, Maurer edited together a 50-minute version of Kook's Tour using available footage from the pilot and released it to the then-booming Super 8 home movie market. Animation Maurer was executive producer of the 39 live-action segments used to introduce and follow Cambria Studios' syndicated The New Three Stooges cartoons (1965‚Äì1966). He later became associated with Hanna-Barbera, working as a writer on their The New Scooby-Doo Movies (1972), Speed Buggy (1973), The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour (1976), and season one of The Richie Rich Show. In 1977 he was working on the Hanna-Barbera cartoon \\"The All New Super Friends Hour\\", and he is credited as being the creator of the characters The Wonder Twins. He also created and was the executive producer of their 1978 series, The Three Robonic Stooges. Maurer's sons, Jeffrey Scott and Michael Maurer also have prolific careers as TV cartoon writers. Death Busy until the end, Maurer died of cancer on November 23, 1986, in Los Angeles. His entombment was at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

His mother came from a well known shipping dynasty in Drag√∏r and his maternal grandfather Hans Nielsen Jeppesen was known as \\"the King of Drag√∏r\\". The M√∏ller family moved to Svendborg on Funen after having lost a power struggle against Anna's sisters and their husbands. In 1904, A. P.

M√∏ller married American Chastine Mc-Kinney, with whom he had two sons, Arnold and Hans, and two daughters, Jane and Sally. Arnold, also known under his middle names as M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller, would become the long-term successor to A. P. M√∏ller. The First World War was a very lucrative period for the shipping business, and A. P. M√∏ller managed to take full advantage of the opportunities. After the war his company was the fourth biggest shipping company in Denmark. The company grew steadily in the interwar years and was the biggest in Denmark at the outbreak of the Second World War. Before the German invasion of Denmark in April 1940, A.P. M√∏ller telegraphed his ships not to obey orders from the occupied Denmark. During the Occupation of Denmark from 1940 to 1945, M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller ran a substantial part of the company from the United States. But the family lost a great deal of money because the US government would not pay full compensation for the use of their ships during the war. A. P.

Environmental issues in Afghanistan predate the political turmoil of the past few decades. Forests and wetlands have been depleted by centuries of grazing and farming, practices which have only increased with modern population growth. In Afghanistan, environmental conservation and economic concerns are not at odds; with 80% of the population dependent on herding or farming, the welfare of the environment is critical to the economic welfare of the people. In 2007, the World Health Organization released a report ranking Afghanistan as the lowest among non-African nations in deaths from environmental hazards. Deforestation U.S. Army soldiers intercept illegal timber as it is smuggled through the Narang Valley the Kunar Province into neighboring Pakistan. Much of the population depends on forests for firewood and the revenue generated by export of pistachios and almonds, which grow in natural woodlands in the central and northern regions. The Badghis and Takhar provinces have lost more than 50% of pistachio woodland. During the conflicts of the past few decades, residents and the militias such as the Northern Alliance have used wood for fuel, and these militia forces have cleared trees which could have provided hiding places for ambushes from their opponents. Further, the use of the woodlands for grazing ground and the collection of nuts for export apparently prevent new pistachio trees from growing. Denser forests in the eastern Nangarhar, Kunar, Nuristan, and other provinces are at risk from timber harvesting by timber mafia. Although the logging is illegal, profits from exporting the timber to neighboring Pakistan are very high. The reason for this is that Pakistani government has its forests tightly protected so the timber mafia are busy cutting down trees in Afghanistan instead. The timber makes its way not only to Peshawar but also to Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore, where most of it is used to make expensive furnitures. As forest cover decrease, the land becomes less and less productive, threatening the livelihood of the rural population and the floods are washing the agricultural lands and destroying the houses. Loss of vegetation also creates a higher risk of floods, which not only endanger the people, but cause soil erosion and decrease the amount of land available for agriculture. To tackle this problem, the Afghan government and agencies from a number of NATO states have teamed up over the past several years to turn Afghanistan green again by planting new trees. Wildlife With very little government infrastructure to discourage hunting, and habitat disappearing because of conflict and drought, much of the country's wildlife is at risk. In 2006, Afghanistan and the Wildlife Conservation Society began a three-year project to protect wildlife and habitats along the Wakhan Corridor and Central Plateau regions.

Water management A recently built irrigation system for better water management The primary threat to Afghanistan's water supply is the droughts, which created food shortages for millions in the recent past. The resulting agricultural crises between 1995 and 2001 have driven major migrations from rural to urban areas. In response to drought, deep wells for irrigation have been drilled which decreased the under ground water level, further draining groundwater resources, which rely on rain for replenishment. By 2003, about 99% of the Sistan wetlands were dry, another result of continued drought and lack of water management. The wetlands, an important habitat for breeding and migrant waterfowl including the dalmatian pelican and the marbled teal, have provided water for agricultural irrigation for at least 5,000 years. They are fed by the Helmand River, which ran at 98% below average in drought years 2001-2003. As in other areas of the country, the loss of natural vegetation resulted in soil erosion; here, sandstorms submerged as many as 100 villages by 2003. Some of the major water reservoirs and dams include the following: *Dahla Dam *Naghlu Dam *Darunta Dam *Kajaki Dam *Lake Qargha Pollution Urban populations have swelled in the past several years. Since 2002, over 5 million former refugees living in Pakistan and Iran have returned home to Afghanistan. Many of these settled in the capital Kabul, which also include migrants that have come from drought-ravaged rural areas. =Nuclear waste by Pakistan= In 2008, the Afghan government alleged that Pakistan had dumped nuclear waste in southern Afghanistan during the Taliban rule (1994-2001). Farooq Wardak, Afghan Parliamentary affairs minister, said the government was setting up a commission to investigate the matter. Afghan President Hamid Karzai recently announced that his administration will investigate the matter. =Domestic and industrial waste= Kabul City, the capital of Afghanistan In 2002, the United Nations Environment Programme found that a lack of waste management systems was creating dangerous conditions in several urban areas. In Kabul's districts 5 and 6, household and medical waste was discarded on streets. Human waste was contained in open sewers, which flowed into the Kabul River and contaminated the city‚Äôs drinking water. Urban dumpsites are used in lieu of managed landfills in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat, often without protection of nearby rivers and groundwater supplies. Medical waste from hospitals is disposed in the dumpsites with the rest of the cities‚Äô waste, contaminating water and air with bacteria and viruses. Lack of sewage management is not unique to Kabul. In urban areas, open sewers are common while wastewater treatment is not. Much of the urban water supply is contaminated by Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Oil refineries are another source of water contamination. In Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif, crude oil spills and leaks are uncontained and unsafe levels of hydrocarbons reach residential water supplies. =Air pollution= Air pollution does not constitute a major problem in Afghanistan, but its reliance on inexpensive energy has created some issues. Most vehicles run on diesel fuel, and household energy often rely on burning wood and other materials. As a result, air pollution in urban areas is visible and may pose health issues.

Its current line-up includes Selim √ñzt√ºrk on electric guitar, Burak Karata≈ü on drums and Ozan Anla≈ü on vocals. History The band was formed in the early years of the 1990s by Selim √ñzt√ºrk (guitar) and Mehmet ≈ûenol ≈ûi≈üli (bass guitar). Although the Turkish music industry was dominated by pop music, Kargo was able to break through with their first album Sil Ba≈ütan (Start Over). The first line-up soon broke up and the two founders had to find new members. The first member to join Kargo was Serkan √áelik√∂z, who is the brother of one of Mehmet's university schoolmates. Being a music student and able to play wide range of instruments as keyboard, guitar, violin, bassoon and contrabass made Serkan a perfect choice. Later Burak Karata≈ü joined Kargo as the drummer and the only thing left was the long search of the lead singer. Koray Candemir, who impressed the other members by his performance in a local bar, was offered the position. With his acceptance Kargo began to record their album Yarƒ±na Ne Kaldƒ± (What is left for tomorrow?) which became a smash hit in 1996. Y√ºzle≈üme, the first single from the album Yarƒ±na Ne Kaldƒ±, rise to the top of the charts even though it was a pure rock song. Kargo proved that a rock group can be successful in the Turkish music industry. In 1997, Kargo released their second album Sevmek Zor (Love is Hard). Sevmek Zor was dedicated to different kind of emotions that can occur in a romantic relationship. Every song had a theme such as pureness, cheating, sadness, guilt, distance, hope, acceptance, pain, etc. Problems that occurred because of unsuccessful tour organization made Kargo bitter. They decided to tell their anger in their next album Yalnƒ±zlƒ±k Mevsimi (Season of Loneliness). In Yalnƒ±zlƒ±k Mevsimi all songs were written and arranged in an order to tell a one big story about being alone. It easily became the favorite album of many Kargo fans. In 2000, Kargo released Sen Bir Meleksin(You are an angel) as their fifth album. Sen Bir Meleksin was soft and acoustic when compared to the previous album Yalnƒ±zlƒ±k Mevsimi. With this album Kargo was able to reach many new listeners from older age groups. After Sen Bir Meleksin, Kargo decided to take a break to go on with their personal projects. They released a Best of Kargo album before this break. Kargo's lead singer Koray Candemir released his first solo album Sade while Selim and Serkan Celikoz successfully produced many albums for many different artists. In 2003, Kargo decided that it was once again time to release an album together. Kargo's bass player M≈û≈û (Mehmet ≈ûenol ≈ûi≈üli) decided not to participate in this new album. Rest of the Kargo started working on their seventh album early in 2004 and Ate≈ü ve Su (Fire and Water) was released in May 2004. In 2005, they released Yƒ±ldƒ±zlarƒ±n Altƒ±nda (Under the Stars) containing cover songs of other artists, as well as remixes of older Kargo songs. The first single, which the album was named after, became a smash hit both on radio and television. With the success of Yƒ±ldƒ±zlarƒ±n Altƒ±nda Kargo toured Turkey, giving more than 100 concerts in a year which made them earn the second position in number of concerts given by a Turkish Rock Artist . In December 2008, Koray Candemir and Serkan √áelik√∂z announced that they quit Kargo after 14 years. Only a few weeks after the announcement, Mehmet ≈ûenol ≈ûi≈üli ended his hiatus and joined the band again as Kargo's main bass player.

His most famous accomplishments were playing with the Ramsey Lewis Trio and the Count Basie Orchestra. His 1975 recording Plenty Good Eaton is considered a classic in the funk music genre. He has been inducted into both the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame and the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Biography Eaton at a rehearsal before performing at the 2008 Taste of 4th Avenue Jazz Festival in Birmingham, Alabama Eaton began studying music at the age of five, and by the time he was fifteen, he had mastered the piano, trumpet, and saxophone. He began playing bass when a teacher allowed him to take one home, spending nearly every waking hour learning the instrument. This led him to become what many called one of the best and most versatile jazz bassists in the business. Eaton came from a music-loving family, including an elder sister who studied at both Fisk University and the Juilliard School of Music in New York. He was a student of John T. \\"Fess\\" Whatley, one of the most influential and well-known educators in American jazz music during the 1920s and 1930s. who also mentored Sun Ra and Erskine Hawkins. Eaton played in a jazz group in college at Tennessee A & I State University, where he earned his bachelor's degree in music. He lent his talents to over 100 albums, and composed about three times as many songs. After spending years on the road as a musician and arranger with a list of artists who form a virtual Who's Who of jazz, Eaton returned to Birmingham, Alabama, to join UAB's music department in 1996. Eaton played on notable recording sessions with John Klemmer, Ike Cole, Bunky Green, The Dells, Bobby Rush, Minnie Riperton, Jerry Butler and Rotary Connection, George Benson, Henry Mancini, Frank Sinatra, Joe Williams, Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald. Eaton was dubbed \\"the Count's Bassist\\" during his seventeen- year stint and over ten recordings with the Count Basie Orchestra. He has also performed with Nancy Wilson, Peggy Lee, Mimi Hines, Sammy Davis Jr., Julie London, Bobby Troup, Brook Benton, Lou Rawls, Nipsey Russell, Morgana King, Gloria Lynne, Herbie Hancock, Magic City Jazz Orchestra, The Platters, Temptations, and The Miracles. In 1974, he began performing and touring with his group Cleve Eaton and Co. In September, 1978 Eaton released a disco-themed track on Gull Records GULS63 called \\"Bama Boogie Woogie\\" which reached number 35 in the BBC Top 75 chart in the UK and proved very popular on the UK club scene at the time. In 2004 his group became Cleve Eaton and the Alabama All Stars. Eaton died on July 5, 2020, in Birmingham, Alabama. He was 80, and had been hospitalized during the last four months of his life.

It used to be a big gold producer during the colonial times, but today Cavalcante is more known by its natural beauties, rivers and waterfalls. It is home to a big number of Quilombos, communities of descendants of African-Brazilians who managed to escape from slavery. Geography It is located just north of the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park and is connected by tarmacked road with Teresina de Goi√°s. It is part of the Chapada dos Veadeiros micro-region. The distance to the state capital of Goi√¢nia is 510 km and most residents have greater contact with Bras√≠lia than with the state capital. Highway connections from Goi√¢nia are made by BR-153 / An√°polis / Alex√¢nia / BR-060 / Planaltina / GO-430 / GO-118 / BR-010 / S√£o Jo√£o da Alian√ßa / Alto Para√≠so de Goi√°s / Teresina de Goi√°s / GO-241. Neighboring municipalities and states are: *north: Tocantins *south: Alto Para√≠so de Goi√°s *west: Colinas do Sul and Mina√ßu *east: Teresina de Goi√°s History The first settlers arrived in the region in 1736 looking for gold. Soon gold was discovered near the stream called Lava P√©s and the village began to grow taking the name of Cavalcante, after Juli√£o Cavalcante its founder. By 1806 the gold had run out and the population declined accordingly. In 1831 the town was elevated to the status of \\"vila\\". In 1953 it became a municipality. In 1957 the district of Colinas do Sul broke off to form its own municipality. Likewise, in 1988 the district of Teresina de Goi√°s was dismembered. Economy The economy is based on cattle raising (60,777 head in 2006) and agriculture. The main crops cultivated are rice and corn, although in modest production. There was one bank‚ÄîBanco do Brasil S.A.

Located 330 km. from Bras√≠lia it has waterfalls, streams and trails. Crossing the low mountains one can reach the springs of hot mineral water that gave the name to a now extinct mining town‚Äî√Ågua Quente. Cavalcante was once considered in the golden age of mining to be a great producer of gold and other minerals. Now livestock raising is the strong point of the local economy. The town also gets some tourism, which enters the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park in Alto Para√≠so de Goi√°s, 100 km to the south. Many tourists come to visit the more than 150 cataloged waterfalls, most of which can only be visited on foot. On a dirt road that borders the national park there are connections with Colinas do Sul and the Serra da Mesa artificial lake. Kalunga Nearby there is a community, called the Kalunga, who are black descendants of the slaves who escaped into the interior to form communities called quilombos. These runaway slaves lived in isolation, building their own identity and their own culture, with African elements added to European elements, mainly the traditional Catholicism of the rural milieu, and intermingling with the indigenous population. Today the Kalunga (approximately 4,500 people) occupy a territory that takes in part of the municipalities of Cavalcante, Monte Alegre and Teresina de Goi√°s. In these territories there are four main population centers: the region of Contenda and V√£o do Calunga, V√£o de Almas, V√£o do Moleque and the former Ribeir√£o dos Negros, later renamed Ribeir√£o dos Bois.

Overview MCG first established its website in 2000 to educate Muslims throughout the world about the Halal status of food ingredients, E-numbers and food products. MCG has written a book, titled A Comprehensive List of Halal Food Products in U.S. and Canadian Supermarkets that lists food products and ingredients that are certified as Halal. MCG also visits mosques and religious centers in the United States to give educational presentations about food products, medicine, cosmetics, and personal care products. A major breakthrough in R&D; was the discovery of the source of L-Cysteine, which was being derived from human hair. Muslim dietary laws do not allow the ingestion of anything that is derived from the human body. It was found that there were several companies that were using this in their baked goods that varied from Naan, which was being supplied to Muslim stores in major U.S. cities, to donuts made by Dunkin' Donuts. A well known Halal food company, AlSafa, uses L-Cysteine in its chicken nuggets, chicken patties, and chicken strips. After MCG's publication of these findings, the source for the L-Cysteine was changed in a large part to chicken or duck feathers. It has not been confirmed that AlSafa uses chicken or duck feathers.

These abnormalities, known as 'primary lesions', give rise to osteoarthritic processes.Quoted from: Elbow dysplasia is a common condition of certain breeds of dogs. Most primary lesions are related to osteochondrosis, a disease of the joint cartilage, and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), the separation of a flap of cartilage on the joint surface. Other common causes of elbow dysplasia include an ununited anconeal process (UAP) and fragmented or ununited medial coronoid process (FCP or FMCP). Osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia. The problem develops in puppyhood, although often is subclinical, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame; otherwise, non-surgical control is usually used.  The disease  Elbow dysplasia is a significant genetically determined problem in many breeds of dog, often manifesting from puppyhood and continuing for life. In elbow dysplasia, the complex elbow joint suffers from a structural defect, often related to its cartilage. This initial condition, known as a \\"primary lesion\\", causes an abnormal level of wear and tear and gradual degradation of the joint, at times disabling or with chronic pain. Secondary processes such as inflammation and osteoarthritis can arise from this damage which increase the problem and add further problems of their own.  Causes  Human femur head showing a flap of cartilage (osteochondritis dissecans) due to avascular necrosis. Similar cartilage damage in dogs causes wear in the joint leading to osteoarthritic processes and is a common cause of elbow dysplasia. The most common cause is osteochondrosis, which is a disease of the joint cartilage, and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD), the separation of a flap of cartilage from the joint surface as a result of avascular necrosis, which in turn arises from failed blood flow in the subchondral bone. In OCD, the normal change of cartilage to bone in the development of the joint fails or is delayed. The cartilage continues to grow and may split or become necrotic. The cause is uncertain, but possibly includes genetics, trauma, and nutrition (including excessive calcium and decreased vitamin C intake). OCD lesions found in the elbow at the medial epicondyle of the humerus are caused by disturbed endochondral fusion of the epiphysis of the medial epicondyle with the distal end of the humerus, which may in turn be caused by avulsion of the epiphysis. Specific conditions related to OCD include fragmentation of the medial coronoid process of the ulna (FMCP) and an ununited anconeal process of the ulna (UAP). All types of OCD of the elbow are most typically found in large breed dogs, with symptoms starting between the ages of 4 to 8 months. Males are affected twice as often as females. The disease often affects both elbows (30 to 70 percent of the time), and symptoms include intermittent lameness, joint swelling, and external rotation and abduction of the paw. Osteoarthritis will develop later in most cases. UAP is caused by a separation from the ulna of the ossification center of the anconeal process. FMCP is caused by a failure of the coronoid process to unite with the ulna.  Diagnosis and treatment  Diagnosis is through x-rays, arthroscopy or CT (computed tomography). In cases with significant lameness, surgery is the best option, especially with UAP. However, conservative treatment is often enough for cases of FMCP and OCD of the medial humeral epicondyle. The dogs are exercised regularly and given pain medication, and between the ages of 12 to 18 months the lameness will often improve or disappear. Control of body weight is important in all cases of elbow dysplasia, and prevention of quick growth spurts in puppies may help to prevent the disease. Surgery for FMCP consists of removal of cartilage and bone fragments and correction of any incongruity of the joint. Reattachment of UAP with a screw is usually attempted before the age of 24 weeks, and after that age the typical treatment is removal of the UAP. Without surgery, UAP rapidly progresses to osteoarthritis, but with FMCP osteoarthritis typically occurs with or without surgery. Osteoarthritis is also a common sequela of OCD of the humerus despite medical or surgical treatment. Elbow replacement surgery has been developed and can be an option for treatment.Total Elbow Replacement, canine and feline (cat and dog) veterinary factsheets Fragmentation of the medial coronoid process = Non- surgical treatment = Conservative therapies include NSAIDs, pain medication, weight management and exercise restrictions.http://www.asgvets.com/rdvms/innovations/ =Total elbow replacement= The elbow is a complex joint, bears 60% of body load, and tolerates problems less well than the hips. As a result, elbow replacement is more complex than hip replacement, rehabilitation can take significantly longer, and some degree of lameness will remain. The surgery is classified as of 2010 as a \\"salvage\\" operation - that is, a last resort for an otherwise viable animal. Success rates of around 80 - 85% (approximately 5 in 6) were being discussed by sources in 2005 and again in 2008. There are also fewer options if the replacement fails; arthrodesis (surgical fusion of the joint) can result in a pain-free but lame gait. However, arthrodesis is itself a complex surgery with a long recovery time, and if arthrodesis is required, additional strain will be borne by other nearby joints, so other leg and shoulder conditions such as osteoarthritis may become more significant. Grading for breeding purposes The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals in the United States will grade elbow X-rays of dogs intended for breeding.

The bar was acquired by former American star jockey Tod Sloan in 1911, who converted it from a bistro and renamed it the \\"New York Bar.\\" Sloan had gone partners with a New Yorker named Clancy (no one seems to know his first name) who owned a bar in Manhattan. That bar was dismantled and shipped to Paris. Sloan then hired Harry MacElhone, a barman from Dundee, Scotland, to run the place.Sturges, Preston. - p. 195, Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges: His Life in His Words. (1990). Simon & Schuster. . History At the time, American tourists and members of the artistic and literary communities were beginning to show up in Paris in ever-increasing numbers and Sloan hoped to capitalize on his fame and make the place a spot where expatriates would feel at home. His bar did become a popular spot for members of the American Field Service Ambulance Corps during World War I. However, financial problems from Sloan's overspending on a lavish personal lifestyle forced him to sell the bar. In 1923, MacElhone, its former barman, bought the bar and added his name to it. He would be responsible for making it into a legendary Parisian landmark. When Harry died, in 1958, his son Andrew took over the bar and ran it until 1989. His son, Duncan, took over the bar and ran it until his death in 1998, when his widow, Isabelle MacElhone, took it over.

Brassey was the only son of Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey, by his first wife Anna, daughter of John Allnutt. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford.thepeerage.com Thomas Allnutt Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey Brassey was an honorary Lieutenant in the London Brigade of Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers from 1888 to 1892. He acted as Assistant Private Secretary to Earl Spencer during the time the latter was First Lord of the Admiralty (1892‚Äì95), and in 1894 was Assistant Secretary of the Royal Commission on Opium that his father chaired. He fought in the Second Boer War as Captain of 69 (Sussex) Company of the Imperial Yeomanry, and was acting Civil Commissioner for the British government at Pretoria following its surrender by the Boers in 1901. He later joined the Queen's Own West Kent Yeomanry, becoming Lieutenant-Colonel in command in 1910, retiring in May 1914. He was awarded the TD in 1909. After the outbreak of the First World War he raised a second battalion to this regiment for home service, which he commanded until 1916, remaining on the Territorial Force Reserve. He was also attached to the Royal Engineers Transport Staff and his service entitled him to two campaign medals, but the location of the qualifying service is not given.AncestryLibrary.com - Army Medal Rolls Index Cards 1914-20 (subscription needed). Appendix F - Peers and Sons of Peers who served in the Great War. He is simply noted as having done \\"Special Service\\" with no details armed force or campaign medals awarded. He was editor of The Naval Annual from 1892 to 1899 and then either alone or jointly with John Leyland editor from 1902 to 1914, and finally in 1919.Ranft, Ironclad to Trident, pp. v‚Äìvi. He stood unsuccessfully for election to Parliament as Liberal candidate for Epsom in 1892, and for Christchurch in 1895 and 1900. In the latter year's general election, he fought against Kenneth Robert Balfour, and after a close and disputed result, the two men gave their names to adjoining roads in the constituency.Bournemouth Echo, 5 February 1901. He made a further unsuccessful attempt to stand for election at Devonport in 1902. He was Mayor of Bexhill- on-Sea in 1909 and served as a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Sussex. He was active in promoting a renewed Imperial Federation League. Brassey was managing director of lead mining and smelting companies in mainland Italy and Sardinia. He was Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem and Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy. Lord Brassey married Lady Idina Mary Nevill, daughter of William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny, on 28 February 1889. They had no children. He succeeded to his father's title in 1918, enabling him to sit in the House of Lords. He died childless in November the following year, aged 56 after being hit by a taxi,The Scotsman, 15 November 1919. when the titles became extinct. He was buried in Catsfield, Sussex. The Countess Brassey died in February 1951, aged 85.

It has a black body, broken yellow or orange irregular striping along its spine, and a tail fin well evolved for swimming. Like other mole salamanders, it is found near pools or slow-moving streams and has a very secretive lifestyle, making it difficult to find. Comparison with the long-toed salamander The Santa Cruz long-toed salamander range is geographically separate from other subspecies of the long-toed salamander (A. macrodactylum) by over 240 kilometers (150 mi). Whereas the nearest subspecies, A. m. sigillatum (\\"Southern long-toed salamander\\") ranges from Tuolumne County north, the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander is found only near a few isolated ponds in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. Like other long-toed salamanders, its belly is sooty to dark brown, and it has tubercles on its feet. The Santa Cruz long- toed salamander has an irregular broken yellow stripe on its back, whereas the common long-toed salamander has a more regular yellow, vertical stripe. Both species have 12 or 13 costal grooves visible from the side. The Santa Cruz long-toed salamander has a measurable degree of mitochondrial DNA genetic distance from the 'coastal' or 'western' subspecies of long-toed salamander. The genetic relationship, however, is still unclear, as more evidence is needed from additional genes and individuals . The results are based on one individual from Monterey County linking to the nearest sampling neighbor, which came from southern Oregon. In both species, eggs are laid singly near the water surface on rush-like spikes, but sometimes in small clusters at the base of logs or sticking to vegetation in the deeper parts of a pond. Hatching larvae are about 10 mm long, and in their first summer, they grow to 50 to 100 mm, but the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander is generally considered the smaller species. The precise times of migration for both species, to and from the breeding ponds, occur during periods of sustained nighttime rainfall. Valencia Lagoon, the modern discovery site On December 2, 1954, the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander was discovered in Valencia Lagoon by R.W. Russell and James Anderson. This small, seasonal lagoon clogged with cattails in Aptos, California, measured only about 30 m by 150 m (100 ft by 500 ft) at that time. Caltrans filled half of the lagoon with a widening of State Route 1 in 1968. The next study of Valencia Lagoon occurred in 1974 by Earth Metrics, whose staff examined the lagoon to develop further migration strategies to allow the creature to better breed and migrate; that study also called for the permanent protection of Valencia Lagoon, which was later effected when the State of California purchased the lagoon.C. Michael Hogan et al., Environmental Impact Report for Stern Medical Office Complex, Aptos, prepared for Santa Cruz County by Earth Metrics Inc., Palo Alto, California. October 15, 1974. Hogan's study also noted the adverse effects of siltation occurring in Valencia Lagoon from the highway embankment erosion created by widening of Route 1; it was reasoned that the siltation should decrease once the vegetation became re-established on these slopes and allow the habitat to improve; moreover, the Earth Metrics study derived additional mitigation for the County of Santa Cruz to follow in considering any further discretionary actions around Valencia Lagoon. Life cycle Most of this salamander's adult life is spent in upland coast live oak forest in small animal burrows during the long dry season (May to October) in coastal California. Once winter rains have soaked the soil and filled ephemeral streams, both males and females migrate up to 2 km to breeding ponds that exist only in winter. In January, the males arrive at the ponds first, in time to prepare for a nighttime courtship. When the male and female have completed their courtship, the male deposits a packet of sperm, the spermatophore, in the water, which the female retrieves and uses to fertilize her eggs. She may lay the eggs singly or in loose clusters of six to eight eggs in shallow water 5‚Äì8 cm deep. Neither parent tends the eggs, which hatch into tadpoles in March and metamorphose into adult salamanders when the pond begins to dry out. The tadpoles commonly eat small copepods. Predators that eat long-toed salamander larvae include aquatic invertebrates, garter snakes, and other vertebrates.California Wildlife, Volume I, Amphibians and Reptiles, ed, by David C. Zeiner, William F. Laudenslayer and Kenneth E. Meyer, published by the California Department of Fish and Game, May 2, 1988. Other species of salamander tadpoles (larvae) compete with those of the long-toed salamander. The breeding ponds of most species of long-toed salamanders completely dry up during the dry season. The year-round ponds likely harbor frogs, fish, and other aquatic predators that eat young salamanders, so these salamanders prefer ephemeral ponds. Most species of long-toed salamanders migrate up into nearby forests and do not spend any time near the breeding pond once they have metamorphosed and the pond is dry. A. m. croceum juveniles, though, often spend their first summer close to the breeding pond in a rodent burrow or rock fissure, only later migrating uphill into the forest. This may be because A. m. croceum breeding ponds retain water all summer. Conservation status Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum was designated as federally endangered in 1967 under the Endangered Species Preservation Act (a precursor to the Endangered Species Act of 1973),Federal Register, 32, 4001, March 10, 1967 and endangered by the State of California in 1971;. It has also been designated as Critically imperiled at the global and state level by NatureServe. Its limited range and fragile specialized habitat place severe restrictions to the viability of this species. There is no definitive population estimate for the Santa Cruz long- toed salamander, but the numbers are deemed to be quite small. Further disturbance of its limited habitat could lead to this species' extinction.Bury RB, Ruth SB (1972) \\"Santa Cruz long-toed salamander: survival in doubt\\",Herpetological Review 4:20-22 References Further reading * J.D.

His siblings were Sarah Lincoln Grigsby and Thomas Lincoln, Jr. After a land title dispute forced the family to leave in 1811, they relocated to Knob Creek farm, eight miles to the north. By 1814, Thomas Lincoln, Abraham's father, had lost most of his land in Kentucky in legal disputes over land titles. In 1816, Thomas and Nancy Lincoln, their nine-year-old daughter Sarah, and seven-year-old Abraham moved to what became Indiana, where they settled in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana. (Their land became part of Spencer County, Indiana, when it was formed in 1818.) Lincoln spent his formative years, from the age of 7 to 21, on the family farm in Southern Indiana. As was common on the frontier, Lincoln received a meager formal education, the aggregate of which may have been less than twelve months. However, Lincoln continued to learn on his own from life experiences and through reading and reciting what he had read or heard from others. In October 1818, two years after their arrival in Indiana, nine-year-old Lincoln lost his birth mother, Nancy, who died after a brief illness known as milk sickness. Thomas Lincoln returned to Elizabethtown, Kentucky late the following year and married Sarah Bush Johnston on December 2, 1819. Lincoln's new stepmother and her three children joined the Lincoln family in Indiana in late 1819. A second tragedy befell the family in January 1828, when Sarah Lincoln Grigsby, Abraham's sister, died in childbirth. In March 1830, 21-year-old Lincoln joined his extended family in a move to Illinois. After helping his father establish a farm in Macon County, Illinois, Lincoln set out on his own in the spring of 1831. Lincoln settled in the village of New Salem where he worked as a boatman, store clerk, surveyor, militia soldier during the Black Hawk War and became a lawyer in Illinois. He was elected to the Illinois Legislature in 1834, and was reelected in 1836, 1838, 1840 and 1844. In November 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd; the couple had four sons. In addition to his law career, Lincoln continued his involvement in politics, serving in the United States House of Representatives from Illinois in 1846. He was elected president of the United States on November 6, 1860. Ancestry Lincoln's first known ancestor in America was Samuel Lincoln, who migrated from Hingham, England to Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1637. Samuel's son, Mordecai, remained in Massachusetts, but Samuel's grandson, who was also named Mordecai, began the family's western migration. John Lincoln, Samuel's great-grandson, continued the westward journey. Born in New Jersey, John moved to Pennsylvania, then brought his family to Virginia. John's son, Captain Abraham Lincoln, who earned that rank for his service in the Virginia militia, was the future president's paternal grandfather and namesake. Born in Berks County, Pennsylvania, he moved with his father and other family members to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley around 1766. The family settled near Linville Creek, in Augusta County, now Rockingham County, Virginia. Captain Lincoln bought the Virginia property from his father in 1773. Thomas Lincoln, the future president's father, was Captain Lincoln's son. Thomas was born in Virginia in January 1778 and moved west to Jefferson County, Kentucky, with his father, mother and siblings around 1782, when he was about five years old.Warren, p. 4. In May 1786, at the age of forty-two, Captain Abraham Lincoln was killed in an Indian ambush while working his fields in Kentucky. Eight-year-old Thomas witnessed his father's murder and might have ended up a victim if his brother, Mordecai, had not shot the attacker. After Captain Lincoln's death, Thomas's mother, Bathsheba Lincoln, moved to Washington County, Kentucky, while Thomas worked at odd jobs in several Kentucky locations. Thomas also spent a year working in Tennessee, before settling with members of his family in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.Warren, p. 5. The identity of Lincoln's maternal grandfather is unclear. In a conversation with William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner and one of his biographers, the president implied that his grandfather was \\"a Virginia planter or large farmer\\", but did not identify him. Lincoln felt that it was from this aristocratic grandfather that he had inherited \\"his power of analysis, his logic, his mental activity, his ambition, and all the qualities that distinguished him from the other members and descendants of the Hanks family.\\"Burlingame, v. I, pp. 2‚Äì3. Lincoln's maternal grandmother, Lucy Shipley Hanks, migrated to Kentucky, with her daughter, Nancy. The debate continues over whether Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was born out of wedlock. Lucy and Nancy resided with Lucy's older sister, Rachael Shipley Berry, and her husband, Richard Berry Sr., in Washington County, Kentucky. Nancy is believed to have remained with the Berry family after her mother's marriage to Henry Sparrow, which took place several years after the women arrived in Kentucky.Warren, p. 6. The Berry home was about a mile and a half from the home of Thomas Lincoln's mother; the families were neighbors for seventeen years. It was during this time when Thomas met Nancy.Warren, pp. 6 and 8. Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks were married on June 12, 1806, at the Beech Fork settlement in Washington County, Kentucky. The Lincolns moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky, following their marriage.Warren, p. 9. =Unproven rumors= Biographers have rejected numerous rumors about Lincoln's paternity. According to historian William E. Barton, one of these rumors began circulating in 1861 \\"in various forms in several sections of the South\\" that Lincoln's biological father was Abraham Enloe, a resident of Rutherford County, North Carolina, who died in that same year. However, Barton dismissed the rumors as \\"false from beginning to end.\\" Enloe publicly denied his connection to Lincoln, but is reported to have privately confirmed it. The Bostic Lincoln Center in Bostic, North Carolina, also claims that Abraham Lincoln was born in Rutherford County, North Carolina, and argues the case that Nancy Hanks had an illegitimate child while she was working for the Enlow family. Rumors of Lincoln's ethnic and racial heritage were also circulated, especially after he entered national politics. Citing Chauncey Burr's Catechism, which references a \\"pamphlet by a western author adducing evidence\\", David J. Jacobson has suggested Lincoln was \\"part Negro\\", but the claim is unproven. Lincoln also received mail that called him \\"a negro\\" and a \\"mulatto\\". Lincoln's appearance Lincoln was described as \\"ungainly\\" and \\"gawky\\" as a youth.Warren, p. 210. Tall for his age, Lincoln was strong and athletic as a teenager. He was a good wrestler, participated in jumping, throwing, and local footraces, and \\"was almost always victorious.\\"Warren, pp. 134‚Äì35. His stepmother remarked that he cared little for clothing.Bartelt, pp. 67‚Äì68. Lincoln dressed as an ordinary boy from a poor, backwoods family, with a gap between his shoes, socks, and pants that often exposed six or more inches of his shin. His lack of interest in his personal attire continued as an adult. When Lincoln lived in New Salem, Illinois, he frequently appeared with a single suspender, and no vest or coat. In 1831, the year after he left Indiana, Lincoln was described as six feet three or four inches tall, weighing 210 pounds, and had a ruddy complexion. Later descriptions included Lincoln's dark hair and dark complexion, which were also evident in photographs taken during his tenure as president of the United States. William H. Herndon described Lincoln as having \\"very dark skin\\"; his cheeks as \\"leathery and saffron-colored\\"; a \\"sallow\\" complexion; and \\"his hair was dark, almost black\\". Lincoln described himself around 1838‚Äì39 as \\"black\\"\\"Lincoln, Abraham, personal description of (To Josephus Hewett), Feb. 13, 1848\\", in References \\"nearly ten years ago\\"‚Äîmeaning 1838‚Äì39. and his complexion in 1859 as \\"dark\\"\\"To F. W. Fell, Dec. 20, 1859\\", in Shaw, The Lincoln Encyclopedia, p. 288. Lincoln's detractors also remarked on his appearance. For example, during the American Civil War the Charleston, South Carolina Mercury described him as having \\"the dirtiest complexion\\" and asked \\"Faugh! After him what white man would be President?\\" Early years (1809‚Äì1831) During his later years, Lincoln was reluctant to discuss his origins. He viewed himself as a self-made man, and may have also found it difficult to confront the untimely deaths of his mother and his sister. However, around the time of his nomination as a candidate for president of the United States, Lincoln provided two brief biographical sketches in response to two inquiries that provide a glimpse of youth in Kentucky and Indiana. One request for a campaign biography came from his friend and fellow Illinois Republican, Jesse W. Fell, in 1859; the other request came from John Locke Scripps, a journalist for the Chicago Press and Tribune.Bartelt, pp. 1 and 9. Both of the Lincoln biographical sketches appeared in the newspapers, while Lincoln's response to Scripps also appeared as part of the reporter's biography of Lincoln, which was published in July 1860. In Lincoln's response Scripps, he summed up his early life in a quote from Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, as \\"the short and simple annals of the poor.\\"Miller, p. 17. Additional details of Lincoln's early life appeared after his death in 1865, when William Herndon began collecting letters and interviews from Lincoln's friends, family and acquaintances. Herndon published his collected materials in Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life (1889). Although Herndon's work is often challenged, historian David Herbert Donald argues that they \\"have largely shaped current beliefs\\" about Lincoln's early life in Kentucky, Indiana and his early days in Illinois.Bartelt, pp. 60 and 61. =Early life in Kentucky (1809‚Äì1816)= Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln became the parents of three children during their years in Kentucky. Sarah was born on February 10, 1807 and Abraham, on February 12, 1809. Another son, Thomas Lincoln, Jr. or \\"Tommy\\", was born in either 1812 or 1813 and died three days later.Warren, pp. 9‚Äì10. In December 1808, Thomas, Nancy and their daughter, Sarah, moved from Elizabethtown to the Sinking Spring farm, on Nolin Creek, near Hodgen's Mill, in Hardin County, Kentucky. (The farm is part of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park in present-day LaRue County, Kentucky.) Abraham was born at the farm two months later, in early February. Due to a land title dispute, the family lived at the farm only two more years before being forced to move. Thomas continued legal action in court, but lost the case in August 1816. Kentucky's survey methods, which used a system of metes and bounds to identify and describe land descriptions, proved to be unreliable when the natural features of the land changed. This issue, compounded by confusion over previous land grants and purchase agreements, caused continual legal disputes over land ownership in Kentucky.Bartelt, p. 14.Warren, p. 12. In the summer of 1811, the family relocated to Knob Creek farm, now a part of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park, eight miles to the north.Warren, p. 10. Situated in a valley of the Rolling Fork River, it had some of the best farmland in the area. Lincoln's earliest recollections of his boyhood are from this farm.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 22 and 24. In 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the Lincoln family from the Knob Creek farm. Years later, after Lincoln became a national political figure, reporters and storytellers often exaggerated his family's poverty and the obscurity of his birth. Lincoln's family circumstances were not unusual for pioneer families at that time. Thomas Lincoln was a farmer, carpenter and landowner in the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm, which comprised 348.5 acres, in December 1808 for $200, but lost his cash investment and the improvements he had made on the farm in a legal dispute over the land title. Thomas Lincoln leased 30 acres of the 230 acre Knob Creek farm owned by George Lindsey but the family was forced to leave it after others claimed a prior title to the land. Of the 816.5 acres that Thomas held in Kentucky, he lost all but 200 acres in land title disputes. By 1816 Thomas was frustrated over the lack of security provided by Kentucky courts. He sold the remaining land he held in Kentucky in 1814, and began planning a move to Indiana, where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure.Warren, p. 13. In 1860 Lincoln stated that the family's move to Indiana in 1816 was \\"partly on account of slavery; but chiefly on account of the difficulty in land titles in Kentucky.\\"Donald, Lincoln, pp. 23‚Äì24. Historians support Lincoln's assertion that the two major reasons for the family's migration to Indiana were most likely due to the problem with securing land titles in Kentucky and the issue of slavery. In the Indiana Territory, once a part of the Old Northwest Territory, the federal government owned the territorial land, which had been surveyed into sections to make it easier to describe in land claims. As a result, the survey method used in Indiana caused fewer ownership problems and helped Indiana attract new settlers. In addition, when Indiana became a state in December 1816, the state constitution prohibited slavery as well as involuntary servitude. Although slaves with earlier indentures still resided within the state, illegal slavery ended within the first decade of statehood.Bartelt, pp. 12 and 14. =Early religious beliefs= Lincoln never joined a religious congregation;Bartelt, p. 109. however, his father, mother, sister and stepmother were all Baptists. Abraham's parents, Thomas and Nancy Lincoln, belonged to Little Mount Baptist Church, a Baptist congregation in Kentucky that had split from a larger church in 1808 because its members refused to support slavery.Bartelt, p. 12. Through their membership in this anti-slavery church, Thomas and Nancy exposed Abraham and Sarah to anti-slavery sentiment at a very young age. After settling in Indiana, Lincoln's parents continued their Baptist church membership, joining the Big Pigeon Baptist Church in 1823. When the Lincoln family left Indiana for Illinois in March 1830, Thomas and his second wife, Sally, were members in good standing at the Little Pigeon Creek Baptist Church.Bartelt, pp. 41 and 135. Sally Lincoln recalled in September 1865 that her stepson Abraham \\"had no particular religion\\"Bartelt, p. 66. and did not talk about it much. She also remembered that he often read the Bible and occasionally attended church services. Matilda Johnston Hall Moore, Lincoln's stepsister, explained in an 1865 interview how Lincoln would read the Bible to his siblings and join them in singing hymns after his parents had gone to church. Other family members and friends who knew Lincoln during his a youth in Indiana recalled that he would often get up on a stump, gather children, friends, and coworkers around him, and repeat a sermon he had heard the previous week to the amusement of the locals, especially the children.Bartelt, pp. 68, 73‚Äì74, and 136. =Indiana years (1816‚Äì1830)= Lincoln spent 14 of his formative years, or roughly one-quarter of his life, from the age of 7 to 21 in Indiana.Warren, pp. xvii and xx. In December 1816, Thomas and Nancy Lincoln, their 9-year-old daughter, Sarah, and 7-year-old Abraham moved to Indiana. They settled on land in an \\"unbroken forest\\"Warren, p. 26. in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana. The Lincoln property lay on land ceded to the United States government as part of treaties with the Piankeshaw and Delaware people in 1804. In 1818 the Indiana General Assembly created Spencer County, Indiana, from portions of Warrick and Perry counties, which included the Lincoln farm.Warren, pp. 16 and 43.Bartelt, pp. 3, 5, and 16. The move to Indiana had been planned for at least several months. Thomas visited Indiana Territory in mid-1816 to select a site and mark his claim, then returned to Kentucky and brought his family to Indiana sometime between November 11 and December 20, 1816, about the same time that Indiana became a state.Warren, pp. 16 and 19.Bartelt, p. 11. However, Thomas Lincoln did not begin the formal process to purchase 160 acres of land until October 15, 1817, when he filed a claim at the land office in Vincennes, Indiana, for property identified as \\"the southwest quarter of Section 32, Township 4 South, Range 5 West\\".Bartelt, p. 24.Warren, p. 41. More recent scholarship on Thomas Lincoln has revised previous characterizations of him as a \\"shiftless drifter\\".Bartelt, p. 69. Documentary evidence suggests he was a typical pioneer farmer of his time. The move to Indiana established his family in a state that prohibited slavery, and they lived in an area that yielded timber to construct a cabin, adequate soil to grow crops that fed the family and water access to markets along the Ohio River.Bartelt, p. 34.Warren, p. 42. Thomas owned horses and livestock, paid taxes, acquired farmland, served the county when necessary and maintained his standing in the local Baptist church. Despite some financial challenges, which involved relinquishing some acreage to pay for debts or to purchase other land, he obtained clear title to 80 acres of land in Spencer County, on June 5, 1827. By 1830, before the family moved to Illinois, Thomas had acquired twenty acres of land adjacent to his property.Bartelt, pp. 25 and 71. Lincoln, who became skilled with an axe, helped his father clear their Indiana land. Recalling his boyhood in Indiana, Lincoln remarked that from the time of his arrival in 1816, he \\"was almost constantly handling that most useful instrument.\\" Once the land had been cleared, the family raised hogs and corn on their farm, which was typical for Indiana settlers at that time. Thomas Lincoln also continued to work as a cabinetmaker and carpenter.Bartelt, pp. 34 and 156. Within a year of the family's arrival in Indiana, Thomas had claimed title to 160 acres of Indiana land and paid $80, a quarter of its total purchase price of $320. The Lincolns and others, many of whom came from Kentucky, settled in what became known the Little Pigeon Creek Community,Bartelt, pp. 24 and 104. about one hundred miles from the Lincoln farm at Knob Creek in Kentucky. By the time, Lincoln had reached age thirteen, nine families with forty-nine children under the age of seventeen were living within a mile of the Lincoln homestead.Warren, pp. xxi and 16. Tragedy struck the family on October 5, 1818, when Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness, an illness caused by drinking contaminated milk from cows who fed on Ageratina altissima (white snakeroot).Bartelt, pp. 18 and 20. Abraham was nine years old; his sister, Sarah, was eleven. After Nancy's death the household consisted of Thomas, aged 40; Sarah, Abraham, and Dennis Friend Hanks, an orphaned nineteen-year-old cousin of Nancy Lincoln.Bartelt, pp. 22‚Äì23, and 77.Dennis Hanks was the ward and nephew of Nancy's aunt, Elizabeth Sparrow and her husband Thomas. He arrived in Indiana with the Sparrows in 1817 and lived with the Sparrows on the Lincoln farm. Hanks moved into the Lincoln home after both the Sparrows died of milk sickness the week before Nancy's death. In 1821 Dennis married Lincoln's stepsister, Elizabeth Johnston. See Bartelt, pp. 77 and 97, and Warren, pp. 51, 53, and 58. In 1819 Thomas left Sarah, Abraham, and Dennis Hanks at the farm in Indiana and returned to Kentucky. On December 2, 1819, Lincoln's father married Sarah \\"Sally\\" Bush Johnston. a widow with three children from Elizabethtown, Kentucky.Bartelt, pp. 23 and 83.Sally was the daughter of Christopher Bush, a successful landowner in Hardin County, Kentucky, and the widow of Daniel Johnston, whom she married on March 13, 1806. After Daniel died in 1816, Sally and her children remained in Elizabethtown until her marriage to Thomas Lincoln on December 2, 1819. Thomas brought Sally and her children to his home in Indiana. See Bartelt, p. 63. Ten-year-old Abe quickly bonded with his new stepmother, who raised her two young stepchildren as her own. Describing her in 1860, Lincoln remarked that she was \\"a good and kind mother\\" to him.Bartelt, p. 10. Sally encouraged Lincoln's eagerness to learn and desire to read, and shared her own collection of books with him. Years later she compared Lincoln to her own son, John D. Johnston: \\"Both were good boys, but I must say‚Äîboth now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see.\\" In an interview with William Herndon following Lincoln's death in 1865, Sally Lincoln described her stepson as dutiful and kind, especially to animals and children and cooperative and uncomplaining. She also remembered him as a \\"moderate\\" eater, who was not picky about what he ate and enjoyed good health.Bartelt, pp. 66‚Äì67. In pioneer-era Indiana, where hunting and fishing were typical pursuits, Thomas and Abraham did not appear to have enjoyed them. Lincoln later admitted that he had shot and killed only a single wild turkey. Apparently, he opposed killing animals, even for food, but occasionally participated in bear hunts, when the bears threatened settlers' farms and communities.Warren, pp. 36‚Äì39. In 1828 another tragedy struck the Lincoln family. Lincoln's older sister, Sarah, who had married Aaron Grigsby on August 2, 1826, died in childbirth on January 20, 1828,Bartelt, p. 37. when she was almost 21 years old. Little is known about Nancy Hanks Lincoln or Abraham's sister. Neighbors who were interviewed by William Herndon agreed that they were intelligent, but gave contradictory descriptions of their physical appearances.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 22‚Äì23. Lincoln spoke very little about either woman. Herndon had to rely on testimony from a cousin, Dennis Hanks, to get an adequate description of Sarah. Those who knew Lincoln as a teenager later recalled his being deeply distraught by his sister's death, and an active participant in a feud with the Grigsby family that erupted afterwards.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 34‚Äì35. See also William Herndon, The History of Abraham Lincoln. Springfield, IL: The Lincoln Printing Co., 1888, p. 12. =First trip to New Orleans (1828)= Possibly looking for a diversion from the sorrow of his sister's death, 19-year-old Lincoln made a flatboat trip to New Orleans in the spring of 1828.Bartelt, pp. 35 and 37. Lincoln and Allen Gentry, the son of James Gentry, owner of a local store near the Lincoln family's homestead, began their trip along the Ohio River at Gentry's Landing, near Rockport, Indiana. En route to Louisiana, Lincoln and Gentry were attacked by several African American men who attempted to take their cargo, but the two successfully defended their boat and repelled their attackers.Bartelt, pp. 10, 178‚Äì79.Prokopowicz (2008), pp. 25‚Äì28. Upon their arrival in New Orleans, they sold their cargo, which was owned by Gentry's father, then explored the city. With its considerable slave presence and active slave market, it is probable that Lincoln witnessed a slave auction, and it may have left an indelible impression on him. (Congress outlawed the importation of slaves in 1808, but the slave trade continued to flourish within the United States.) How much of New Orleans Lincoln saw or experienced is open to speculation. Whether he actually witnessed a slave auction at that time, or on a later trip to New Orleans, his first visit to the Deep South exposed him to new experiences, including the cultural diversity of New Orleans and a return trip to Indiana aboard a steamboat.Bartelt, pp. 37‚Äì38. =Education= Lincoln as a boy, reading by firelight In 1858, when responding to a questionnaire sent to former members of Congress, Lincoln described his education as \\"defective\\".Bartelt, p. 7. In 1860, shortly after his nomination for U.S. president, Lincoln apologized for and regretted his limited formal education. Lincoln was self-educated. His formal schooling was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than twelve months. He never attended college, but Lincoln retained a lifelong interest in learning.Bartelt, pp. 10 and 33.Madison, p. 110. In a September 1865 interview with William Herndon, Lincoln's stepmother described Abraham as a studious boy who read constantly, listened intently to others and had a deep interest in learning. Lincoln continued reading as a means of self improvement as an adult, studying English grammar in his early twenties and mastering Euclid after he became a member of Congress.Bartelt, pp. 12, 65‚Äì67. Dennis Hanks, a cousin of Lincoln's mother, Nancy, claimed he gave Lincoln \\"his first lesson in spelling‚Äîreading and writing\\" and boasted, \\"I taught Abe to write with a buzzards quill which I killed with a rifle and having made a pen‚Äîput Abes hand in mind [sic] and moving his fingers by my hand to give him the idea of how to write.\\"Donald, Lincoln, p. 29. Hanks, who was ten years older than Lincoln and \\"only marginally literate\\", may have helped Lincoln with his studies when he was very young, but Lincoln soon advanced beyond Hanks's abilities as a teacher.Bartelt, p. 80. Abraham, aged six, and his sister Sarah began their education in Kentucky, where they attended a subscription school about two miles north of their home on Knob Creek. Classes were held only a few months during the year.Warren, pp. 11 and 24.Bartelt, p. 26. In December 1816, when they arrived in Indiana, there were no schools in the area, so Abraham and his sister continued their studies at home until the first school at Little Pigeon Creek was established around 1819, \\"about a mile and a quarter south of the Lincoln farm.\\"Bartelt, p. 27. In the 1820s, educational opportunities for pioneer children, including Lincoln, were meager. The parents of school-aged children paid for the community's schools and its instructors. During Indiana's pioneer era, Lincoln's limited formal schooling was not unusual.Madison, p. 111. Lincoln was taught by itinerant teachers at blab schools, which were schools for younger students, and paid by the students' parents.Warren, p. xx. Because school resources were scarce, much of a child's education was informal and took place outside the confines of a classroom.Bartelt, p. 8. Family, neighbors and schoolmates of Lincoln's youth recalled that he was an avid reader. Lincoln read Aesop's Fables, the Bible, The Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson Crusoe, and Parson Weems's The Life of Washington, as well as newspapers, hymnals, songbooks, math and spelling books, among others.Bartelt, pp. 118, 143, 148.Warren, pp. xix, 30, 46, and 48. Later studies included Shakespeare's works, poetry, and British and American history. Although Lincoln was unusually tall () and strong, he spent so much time reading that some neighbors thought he was lazy for all his \\"reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.\\"Miller, p. 31. and must have done it to avoid strenuous manual labor. His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy \\"physical labor\\", but loved to read. \\"He (Lincoln) read so much‚Äîwas so studious‚Äîtoo[k] so little physical exercise‚Äîwas so laborious in his studies,\\" that years later, when Lincoln lived in Illinois, Henry McHenry remembered, \\"that he became emaciated and his best friends were afraid that he would craze himself.\\"Donald, Lincoln, p. 55. In addition to reading, Lincoln cultivated other skills and interests during his youth in Kentucky and Indiana. He developed a plain, backwoods style of speaking, which he practiced during his youth by telling stories and sermons to his family, schoolmates and members of the local community. By the time he was twenty-one, Lincoln had become \\"an able and eloquent orator\\";Warren, p. 211. however, some historians have argued his speaking style, figures of speech, and vocabulary remained unrefined, even as he entered national politics.Miller, p. 5. =Move to Illinois (1830)= Statue of 21-year-old Abraham Lincoln in downtown Decatur, Illinois, on the site of his first political speech. In 1830, when Lincoln was twenty-one years of age, thirteen members of the extended Lincoln family moved to Illinois. Thomas, Sally, Abraham, and Sally's son, John D. Johnston, went as one family. Dennis Hanks and his wife Elizabeth, who was also Abraham's stepsister, and their four children joined the party. Hanks's half-brother, Squire Hall, along with his wife, Matilda Johnston, another of Lincoln's stepsisters, and their son formed the third family group. Historians disagree on who initiated the move, but it may have been Dennis Hanks rather than Thomas Lincoln.Bartelt, pp. 38‚Äì40. Thomas had no obvious reason to leave Indiana. He owned land and was a respected member of his community, but Hanks had not fared as well. In addition, John Hanks, one of Dennis' cousins, lived in Macon County, Illinois. Dennis later remarked that Sally refused to part with her daughter, Elizabeth, so Sally may have persuaded Thomas to move to Illinois.Bartelt, p. 40.Warren, p. 204. The Lincoln-Hanks-Hall families departed Indiana in early March 1830. It is generally agreed they crossed the Wabash River at Vincennes, Indiana, into Illinois, and the family settled on a site selected in Macon County, Illinois,Bartelt, pp. 41 and 63. west of Decatur. Lincoln, who was twenty-one years old at the time, helped his father build a log cabin and fences, clear of land and put in a crop of corn. That autumn the entire family fell ill with a fever, but all survived. The early winter of 1831 was especially brutal, with many locals calling it the worst they had ever experienced. (In Illinois it was known as the \\"Winter of Deep Snow\\".) In the spring, as the Lincoln family prepared to move to a homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Lincoln was ready to strike out on his own. Thomas and Sally moved to Coles County, and remained in Illinois for the rest of their lives.Bartelt, p. 65. Although Sally Lincoln and his cousin, Dennis Hanks, maintained that Thomas loved and supported his son, the father-son relationship became strained after the family moved to Illinois.Bartelt, p. 71. Perhaps Thomas did not fully appreciate his son's ambition, while Abraham never knew of Thomas's early struggles. In 1851, after the move to Illinois, Abraham refused to visit his dying father, and failed to take his own sons to visit their grandparents. Historian Rodney O. Davis has argued that the reason for the strain in their relationship was due to Lincoln's success as a lawyer and his marriage to Mary Todd Lincoln, who came from a wealthy, aristocratic family, and the two men no longer related to each other's circumstances in life. =Another trip to New Orleans (1831)= Lincoln, along with John Johnson and John Hanks, accepted an offer from Denton Offutt to meet in Springfield, Illinois, and take a load of cargo to New Orleans in 1831. Departing from Springfield in late April or early May along the Sangamon River, their boat had difficulty getting past a mill dam northwest of Springfield, near the village of New Salem. Offutt, who was impressed by New Salem's location and believed that steamboats could navigate the river to the village, made arrangements to rent the mill and open a general store. Offutt hired Lincoln as his clerk and the two men returned to New Salem after they discharged their cargo in New Orleans.Oates, pp. 15‚Äì17. New Salem (1831‚Äì1837) =Lincoln settles in New Salem, Illinois= When Lincoln returned to New Salem in late July 1831, he found a promising community, but it probably never had a population that exceed a hundred residents. New Salem was a small commercial settlement that served several local communities. The village had a sawmill, grist mill, blacksmith shop, cooper's shop, wool carding shop, a hat maker, general store, and a tavern spread out over more than a dozen buildings. Offutt did not open his store until September, so Lincoln found temporary work in the interim and was quickly accepted by the townspeople as a hardworking and cooperative young man.Oates, pp. 17‚Äì18; Donald, Lincoln, p. 39. Once Lincoln began working in the store, he met a rougher crowd of settlers and workers from the surrounding communities, who came into New Salem to purchase supplies or have their corn ground. Lincoln's humor, storytelling abilities, and physical strength fit the young, raucous element that included the so-called Clary's Grove boys, and his place among them was cemented after a wrestling match with a local champion, Jack Armstrong. Although Lincoln lost the fight with Armstrong, he earned the respect of the locals.Oates, pp. 18‚Äì20; Donald, Lincoln, p. 40. During his first winter in New Salem, Lincoln attended a meeting of the New Salem debating club. His performance in the club, along with his efficiency in managing the store, sawmill, and gristmill, in addition to his other efforts at self-improvement soon gained the attention of the town's leaders, such as Dr. John Allen, Mentor Graham, and James Rutledge.Oates, pp. 18‚Äì20; Donald, Lincoln, p. 41. The men encouraged Lincoln to enter politics, feeling that he was capable of supporting the interests of their community. In March 1832 Lincoln announced his candidacy in a written article that appeared in the Sangamo Journal, which was published in Springfield. While Lincoln admired Henry Clay and his American System, the national political climate was undergoing a change and local Illinois issues were the primary political concerns of the election. Lincoln opposed the development of a local railroad project, but supported improvements in the Sangamon River that would increase its navigability. Although the two-party political system that pitted Democrats against Whigs had not yet formed, Lincoln would become one of the leading Whigs in the state legislature within the next few years.Oates, pp. 18‚Äì20; Donald, Lincoln, pp. 41‚Äì43. Daguerreotype portrait of Henry Clay ‚Äì Clay was a major political influence on Lincoln throughout his career By the spring of 1832, Offutt's business had failed and Lincoln was out of work. Around this time, the Black Hawk War erupted and Lincoln joined a group of volunteers from New Salem to repel Black Hawk, who was leading a group of 450 warriors along with 1,500 women and children to reclaim traditional tribal lands in Illinois. Lincoln was elected as captain of his unit, but he and his men never saw combat. Lincoln later commented In the late 1850s that the selection by his peers was \\"a success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since.\\" Lincoln returned to central Illinois after a few months of militia service to campaign in Sangamon County before the August 6 legislative election. When the votes were tallied, Lincoln finished eighth out of thirteen candidates. Only the top four candidates were elected, but Lincoln managed to secure 277 out of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 44‚Äì46. Without a job, Lincoln and William F. Berry, a member of Lincoln's militia company during the Black Hawk War, purchased one of the three general stores in New Salem. The two men signed personal notes to purchase the business and a later acquisition of another store's inventory, but their enterprise failed. By 1833 New Salem was no longer a growing community; the Sangamon River proved to be inadequate for commercial transportation and no roads or railroads allowed easy access to other markets. In January, Berry applied for a liquor license, but the added revenue was not enough to save the business.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 47‚Äì50. With the closure of the Lincoln-Berry store, Lincoln was again unemployed and would soon have to leave New Salem. However, in May 1833, with the assistance of friends interested in keeping him in New Salem, Lincoln secured an appointment from President Andrew Jackson as the postmaster of New Salem, a position he kept for three years. During this time, Lincoln earned between $150 and $175 as postmaster, hardly enough to be considered a full- time source of income. Another friend helped Lincoln obtain an appointment as an assistant to county surveyor John Calhoun, a Democratic political appointee. Lincoln had no experience at surveying, but he relied on borrowed copies of two works and was able to teach himself the practical application of surveying techniques as well as the trigonometric basis of the process. His income proved sufficient to meet his day-to-day expenses, but the notes from his partnership with Berry were coming due.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 50‚Äì54. While Lincoln was attending his first legislative session in January 1835, the sheriff sold Lincoln's horse, saddle, bridle, and surveying equipment in partial satisfaction of the debt. Berry died soon after this, leaving Lincoln responsible for the remaining debt. =Politics and the law= In 1834 Lincoln's decision to run for the state legislature for a second time was strongly influenced by his need to satisfy his debts, what he jokingly referred to as his \\"national debt\\", and the additional income that would come from a legislative salary. By this time Lincoln was a member of the Whig party. His campaign strategy excluded a discussion of the national issues and concentrated on traveling throughout the district and greeting voters. The district's leading Whig candidate was Springfield attorney John Todd Stuart, whom Lincoln knew from his militia service during the Black Hawk War. Local Democrats, who feared Stuart more than Lincoln, offered to withdraw two of their candidates from the field of thirteen, where only the top four vote- getters would be elected, to support Lincoln. Stuart, who was confident of his own victory, told Lincoln to go ahead and accept the Democrats' endorsement. On August 4 Lincoln polled 1,376 votes, the second highest number of votes in the race, and won one of the four seats in the election, as did Stuart.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 52‚Äì53. Lincoln was reelected to the state legislature in 1836, 1838, and 1840. John T. Stuart as a major during the Black Hawk War Stuart, a cousin of Lincoln's future wife, Mary Todd, was impressed with Lincoln and encouraged him to study law.Oates, p. 26; Donald, Lincoln, p. 53; Harris, p. 16. Lincoln was probably familiar with courtrooms from an early age. While the family was still in Kentucky, his father was frequently involved with filing land deeds, serving on juries, and attending sheriff's sales, and later, Lincoln may have been aware of his father's legal issues. When the family moved to Indiana, Lincoln lived within of three county courthouses. Attracted by the opportunity of hearing a good oral presentation, Lincoln, as did many others on the frontier, attended court sessions as a spectator. The practice continued when he moved to New Salem. Noticing how often lawyers referred to them, Lincoln made a point of reading and studying the Revised Statutes of Indiana, the Declaration of Independence, and the United States Constitution.Oates, p. 15. Oates explained Lincoln's interest in the court proceedings: \\"A sort of legal buff, he watched transfixed as young country lawyers wooed juries, cross-examined witnesses, delivered impassioned summations. He listened, too, as old-timers sat on the steps of the courthouses, spitting tobacco juice and discussing the latest trials and the capricious workings of the law ‚Äì the verdict a jury might reach, the sentence a judge might hand down.\\" Using books borrowed from the law firm of Stuart and Judge Thomas Drummond, Lincoln began to study law in earnest during the first half of 1835.Oates, p. 28; Donald, Lincoln, p. 54. Lincoln did not attend law school, and stated: \\"I studied with nobody.\\" As part of his training, he read copies of Blackstone's Commentaries, Chitty's Pleadings, Greenleaf's Evidence, and Joseph Story's Equity Jurisprudence.Donald, Lincoln, p. 53. In February 1836 Lincoln stopped working as a surveyor,Donald, Lincoln, p. 58. and in March 1836, took the first step to becoming a practicing attorney when he applied to the clerk of the Sangamon County Court to register as a man of good and moral character. After passing an oral examination by a panel of practicing attorneys, Lincoln received his law license on September 9, 1836. In April 1837 he was enrolled to practice before the Supreme Court of Illinois, and moved to Springfield, where he went into partnership with Stuart.Oates, pp. 32‚Äì39. Illinois Legislature (1834‚Äì1842) Lincoln's first session in the Illinois legislature ran from December 1, 1834, to February 13, 1835. In preparation for the session Lincoln borrowed $200 from Coleman Smoot, one of the richest men in Sangamon County, and spent $60 of it on his first suit of clothes. As the second youngest legislator in this term, and one of thirty-six first-time attendees, Lincoln was primarily an observer, but his colleagues soon recognized his mastery of \\"the technical language of the law\\" and asked him to draft bills for them.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 53‚Äì54. When Lincoln announced his bid for reelection in June 1836, he addressed the controversial issue of expanded suffrage. Democrats advocated universal suffrage for white males residing in the state for at least six months. They hoped to bring Irish immigrants, who were attracted to the state because of its canal projects, onto the voting rolls as Democrats. Lincoln supported the traditional Whig position that voting should be limited to property owners.Donald, Lincoln, p. 59. Lincoln was reelected on August 1, 1836, as the top vote getter in the Sangamon delegation. This delegation of two senators and seven representatives was nicknamed the \\"Long Nine\\" because all of them were above average height. Despite being the second youngest of the group, Lincoln was viewed as the group's leader and the floor leader of the Whig minority. The Long Nine's primary agenda was the relocation of the state capital from Vandalia to Springfield and a vigorous program of internal improvements for the state.; Donald, Lincoln, pp. 59‚Äì60; Lincoln's influence within the legislature and within his party continued to grow with his reelection for two subsequent terms in 1838 and 1840. By the 1838‚Äì1839 legislative session, Lincoln served on at least fourteen committees and worked behind the scenes to manage the program of the Whig minority.Donald, Lincoln, p. 75. While serving as a state legislator, Illinois Auditor James Shields challenged Lincoln to a duel. Lincoln had published an inflammatory letter in the Sangamon Journal, a Springfield newspaper, that poked fun at Shields. Lincoln's future wife, Mary Todd, and her close friend, continued writing letters about Shields without Lincoln's knowledge. Shields took offense to the articles and demanded \\"satisfaction\\". The incident escalated to the two parties meeting on Missouri's Sunflower Island, near Alton, Illinois, to participate in a duel, which was illegal in Illinois. Lincoln took responsibility for the articles and accepted. Lincoln choose cavalry broadswords as the duel's weapons because Shields was known as an excellent marksman. Just prior to engaging in combat, Lincoln demonstrated his physical advantage (his long arm reach) by easily cutting a branch above Shields's head. Their seconds intervened and convinced the men to cease hostilities on the grounds that Lincoln had not written the letters. (originally published by Civil War Times magazine.) =Internal improvements= The Illinois governor called for a special legislative session during the winter of 1835‚Äì1836 in order to finance what became known as the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which connected the Illinois and Chicago rivers and linked Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. The proposal would allow the state government to finance the construction with a $500,000 loan. Lincoln voted in favor of the commitment, which passed 28‚Äì27.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 58‚Äì59. Lincoln had always supported Henry Clay's vision of the American System, which saw a prosperous America supported by a well-developed network of roads, canals, and, later, railroads. Lincoln favored raising the funds for these projects through the federal government's sale of public lands to eliminate interest expenses; otherwise, private capital should bear the cost alone. Fearing that Illinois would fall behind other states in economic development, Lincoln shifted his position to allow the state to provide the necessary support for private developers. Stephen A. Douglas ‚Äì Douglas and Lincoln would spend much of their public careers as rivals. In the next session a newly elected legislator, Stephen A. Douglas, went even further and proposed a comprehensive $10 million state loan program, which Lincoln supported. However, the Panic of 1837 effectively destroyed the possibility of more internal improvements in Illinois. The state became \\"littered with unfinished roads and partially dug canals\\"; the value of state bonds fell; and interest on the state's debts was eight times its total revenue. The state government took forty years to pay off this debt.; Donald, Lincoln, pp. 61‚Äì62. Carwardine and Donald both emphasize that Douglas, not Lincoln, was the \\"prime mover\\" for this program. Lincoln had a couple of ideas to salvage the internal improvements program. First, he proposed that the state buy public lands at a discount from the federal government and then sell them to new settlers at a profit, but the federal government rejected the idea. Next, he proposed a graduated land tax that would have passed more of the tax burden to the owners of the most valuable land, but the majority of the legislators were unwilling to commit any further state funds to internal improvement projects. The state's financial depression continued through 1839.Carwardine, p. 16. =Selection of Springfield as the state capital= In the 1830s Illinois welcomed more immigrants, many from New York and New England, who tended to move into the northern and central parts of the state. Vandalia, which was located in the more stagnant southern section, seemed unsuitable as the state's seat of government. On the other hand, Springfield, in Sangamon County, was \\"strategically located in central Illinois\\" and was already growing \\"in population and refinement\\".Oates, pp. 34‚Äì35. Those who opposed the relocation of the state government to Springfield first attempted to weaken the Sangamon County delegation's influence by dividing the county into two new counties, but Lincoln was instrumental in first amending and then killing this proposal in his own committee. Throughout the lengthy debate \\"Lincoln's political skills were repeatedly tested\\". He finally succeeded when the legislature accepted his proposal that the chosen city would be required to contribute $50,000 and of land for construction of a new state capitol building‚Äîonly Springfield could comfortably meet this financial demand. The final action was tabled twice, but Lincoln resurrected it by finding acceptable amendments to draw additional support, including one that would have allowed reconsideration in the next session. As other locations were voted down, Springfield was selected by a 46 to 37 vote margin on February 28, 1837. Under Lincoln's leadership reconsideration efforts were defeated in the 1838‚Äì1839 sessions.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 62‚Äì64 and 75. Orville Browning, who would later become a close Lincoln friend and confidant, guided the legislation through the Illinois Senate, and the move became effective in 1839.Oates, p. 35. The Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois ‚Äì Lincoln was instrumental in bringing the state capitol to Springfield and served his final term in the Illinois legislature in this building. =Illinois State Bank= Lincoln, like Henry Clay, favored federal control over the nation's banking system, but President Jackson had effectively killed the Bank of the United States by 1835. That same year Lincoln crossed party lines to vote with pro-bank Democrats in chartering the Illinois State Bank. As he did in the internal improvements debates, Lincoln searched for the best available alternative.Carwardine, p. 16; Donald, Lincoln, p. 76. According to historian and Lincoln biographer Richard Carwardine, Lincoln felt: Opponents of the state bank initiated an investigation designed to close the bank in the 1836‚Äì1837 legislative session. On January 11, 1837, Lincoln made his first major legislative speech supporting the bank and attacking its opponents. He condemned \\"that lawless and mobocratic spirit ... which is already abroad in the land, and is spreading with rapid and fearful impetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every institution, or even moral principle, in which persons and property have hitherto found security.\\"Donald, Lincoln, pp. 62‚Äì63. Blaming the opposition entirely on the political class, Lincoln called politicians \\"at least one long step removed from honest men,\\"Carwardine, pp. 16‚Äì17. Lincoln further states, \\"I say this with the greater freedom because, being a politician myself, none can regard it as personal.\\" Lincoln commented: Westerners in the Jacksonian Era were generally skeptical of all banks, and this was aggravated after the Panic of 1837, when the Illinois Bank suspended specie payments. Lincoln still defended the bank, but it was too strongly linked to a failing credit system that lead to devalued currency and loan foreclosures to generate much political support.Carwardine, p. 17. In 1839 Democrats led another investigation of the state bank, with Lincoln as a Whig representative on the investigating committee. Lincoln was instrumental in the committee's conclusion that the suspension of specie payment was related to uncontrollable economic conditions rather than \\"any organic defects of the institutions themselves.\\"Donald, Lincoln, p. 77. However, the legislation allowing the suspension of specie payments was set to expire at the end of December 1840, and Democrats wanted to adjourn without further extensions. In an attempt to avoid a quorum on adjournment, Lincoln and several others jumped out of a first story window, but the Speaker counted them as present and \\"the bank was killed.\\"Carwardine, p. 17. Referring to Nicolay and Hay's Abraham Lincoln: A History (v. I, pp. 158‚Äì62), Carwardine notes, \\"Adjournment, credit resumption, and Democratic ridicule followed. Lincoln, the respecter of law and constitutional order, who 'deprecated everything that savored of the revolutionary,' always regretted the action.\\" By 1841 Lincoln was less supportive of the state bank, although he would continue to make speeches around the state supporting it. He concluded, \\"If there was to be this continual warfare against the Institutions of the State ... the sooner it was brought to an end the better.\\"Donald, Lincoln, p. 78; Carwardine, p. 17. =Abolitionism= In the 1830s the slaveholding states began to take notice of the growth of antislavery rhetoric in the North. Their anger focused on abolitionists, whom they accused of fomenting slave revolts by distributing \\"incendiary pamphlets\\" of the slaves. When southern legislatures passed resolutions calling for suppression of abolitionist societies, they often received a favorable response from their northern counterparts. In January 1837 the Illinois legislature passed a resolution declaring that they \\"highly disapprove of the formation of abolition societies\\", that \\"the right of property in slaves is sacred to the slave-holding States by the Federal Government, and that they cannot be deprived of that right without their consent\\", and that \\"the General Government cannot abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, against the will of the citizens of said District.\\" The vote in the Illinois Senate was 18 to 0, and 77 to 6 in the House, with Lincoln and Dan Stone, who was also from Sangamon County, voting in opposition. Because relocation of the state capital was still the number one issue on the two men's agendas, they made no comment on their votes until the relocation was approved.Donald, Lincoln, p. 63; Burlingame, v. I, p. 122. On March 3, with his other legislative priorities behind him, Lincoln filed a formal written protest with the legislature that stated \\"the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy.\\"Burlingame, v. I, p. 122. Lincoln criticized abolitionists on practical grounds, arguing that \\"the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than to abate its [slavery's] evils.\\"Burlingame, v. I, p. 124. He also addressed the issue of slavery in the nation's capital in a different manner from the resolutions, writing that \\"the Congress of the United States has the power, under the constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; but that power ought not to be exercised unless at the request of the people of said District.\\"Burlingame, v. I, p. 126. Lincoln biographer Benjamin P. Thomas commented on the significance of Lincoln's action: =Lincoln's Lyceum Address= Lincoln's address to the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois on January 27, 1838, was titled \\"The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions\\". In this speech Lincoln described the dangers of slavery in the United States, an institution he believed would corrupt the federal government. Prairie lawyer =Partnerships with Stuart and Logan= In 1837, from the start of the law partnership with Stuart, Lincoln handled most of the firms clients, while Stuart was primarily concerned with politics and election to the United States House of Representatives. The law practice had as many clients as it could handle. Most fees were five dollars, with the common fee ranging between two and a half dollars and ten dollars. Lincoln quickly realized that he was equal in ability and effectiveness to most other attorneys, whether they were self-taught like Lincoln or had studied with a more experienced lawyer. Following Stuart's elected to Congress in November 1839, Lincoln ran the practice on his own. Lincoln, like Stuart, considered his legal career as simply a catalyst to his political ambitions.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 70‚Äì74. By 1840 Lincoln was drawing $1,000 annually from the law practice, along with his salary as a legislator. However, when Stuart was reelected to Congress, Lincoln was no longer content to carry the entire load. In April 1841 he entered into a new partnership with Stephen T. Logan. Logan was nine years older than Lincoln, the leading attorney in Sangamon County, and a former attorney in Kentucky before he moved to Illinois. Logan saw Lincoln as a complement to his practice, recognizing that Lincoln's effectiveness with juries was superior to his own in that area. Once again, clients were plentiful for the firm, although Lincoln received one-third of the firm's proceeds rather than the even split he had enjoyed with Stuart.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 86‚Äì98. Lincoln's association with Logan was a learning experience. He absorbed from Logan some of the finer points of law and the importance of proper and detailed case research and preparation. Logan's written pleadings were precise and on point, and Lincoln used them as his model. However, much of Lincoln's development was still self-taught. Historian David Herbert Donald wrote that Logan taught him that \\"there was more to law than common sense and simple equity\\" and Lincoln's study began to focus on \\"procedures and precedents.\\"Donald. Lincoln, p. 99. During this time Lincoln did not study law books, but he did spend \\"night after night in the Supreme Court Library, searching out precedents that applied to the cases he was working on.\\" Lincoln stated, \\"I love to dig up the question by the roots and hold it up and dry it before the fires of the mind.\\" His written briefs, especially important in Illinois Supreme Court cases, were prepared in great detail with precedents noted that often went back to the origins of English common law. Lincoln's growing skills became evident as his appearances before the Supreme Court increased and would serve him well in his political career. By the time he went to Washington in 1861 Lincoln had appeared over three hundred times before this court.Harris, p. 21; Donald, Lincoln, pp. 99‚Äì100. Lincoln biographer Stephen B. Oates wrote, \\"It was here that he earned his reputation as a lawyer's lawyer, adept at meticulous preparation and cogent argument.\\"Oates, p. 104. =Lincoln and Herndon= Lincoln's partnership with Logan was dissolved in the fall of 1844, when Logan entered into a partnership with his son. Lincoln, who probably could have had his choice of more established attorneys, was tired of being the junior partner and entered into partnership with William Herndon, who had been reading law in the offices of Logan and Lincoln. Herndon, like Lincoln, was an active Whig, but the party in Illinois at that time was split into two factions. Lincoln was connected to the older, \\"silk stocking\\" element of the party through his marriage to Mary Todd; Herndon was one of the leaders of the younger, more populist portion of the party. The Lincoln-Herndon partnership continued through Lincoln's presidential election, and Lincoln remained a partner of record until his death.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 100‚Äì103; Harris, p. 31; Oates, pp. 71‚Äì72. Prior to his partnership with Herndon, Lincoln had not regularly attended court in neighboring communities. This changed as Lincoln became one of the most active regulars on the circuit through 1854, interrupted only by his two-year stint in Congress. The Eighth Circuit covered . Each spring and fall Lincoln traveled the district for nine to ten weeks at a time, netting around $150 for each ten-week circuit. On the road, lawyers and judges lived in cheap hotels, with two lawyers to a bed; six or eight men to a room.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 104‚Äì106; Thomas, pp. 142‚Äì153. David Davis ‚Äì Davis, a judge on Lincoln's circuit in 1848, would be placed on the United States Supreme Court by Lincoln in 1862 Lincoln's reputation for integrity and fairness on the circuit led to him being in high demand both from clients and local attorneys who needed assistance. It was during his time riding the circuit that he picked up one of his lasting nicknames, \\"Honest Abe\\". The clients he represented, the men he rode the circuit with, and the lawyers he met along the way became some of Lincoln's most loyal political supporters.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 105‚Äì106 and 149; Harris, p. 65. One of these was David Davis, a fellow Whig who, like Lincoln, promoted nationalist economic programs and opposed slavery without actually becoming an abolitionist. Davis joined the circuit in 1848 as a judge and would occasionally appoint Lincoln to fill in for him. They traveled the circuit for eleven years, and Lincoln would eventually appoint him to the United States Supreme Court.Donald, Lincoln, p. 146. Another close associate was Ward Hill Lamon, an attorney in Danville, Illinois. Lamon, the only local attorney with whom Lincoln had a formal working agreement, accompanied Lincoln to Washington in 1861.Donald, LIncoln, p. 148; Thomas, p. 156. =Case load and income= Unlike other attorneys on the circuit, Lincoln did not supplement his income by engaging in real estate speculation or operating a business or a farm. His income was generally what he earned practicing law. In the 1840s this amounted to $1,500 to $2,500 a year, increasing to $3,000 in the early 1850s, and was $5,000 by the mid-1850s.Harris, p. 35; Donald, Lincoln, p. 151; Oates, p. 98. Criminal law made up the smallest portion of Lincoln and Herndon's case work. In 1850 the firm was involved in eighteen percent of the cases on the Sangamon County Circuit; by 1853 it had grown to thirty-three percent. On his return from his single term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Lincoln turned down an offer of a partnership in a Chicago law firm.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 142‚Äì145. Based strictly on the volume of cases, Lincoln was \\"undoubtedly one of the outstanding lawyers of central Illinois.\\" Lincoln was also in demand on the federal courts. He received important retainers from cases in the United States Northern District Court in Chicago.Thomas, pp. 178‚Äì179. Lincoln was involved in at least two cases involving slavery. In an 1841 Illinois Supreme Court case, Bailey v. Cromwell, Lincoln successfully prevented the sale of a woman who was alleged to be a slave, making the argument that in Illinois \\"the presumption of law was ... that every person was free, without regard to color.\\" In 1847 Abraham Lincoln defended Robert Matson, a slave owner who was trying to retrieve his runaway slaves. Matson brought slaves from his Kentucky plantation to work on land he owned in Illinois. The slaves were represented by Orlando Ficklin, Usher Linder, and Charles H. Constable.McKirdy, pp. 44‚Äì56. The slaves ran away because they believed that once they were in Illinois they were free, since the Northwest Ordinance forbade slavery in the territory that included Illinois. In this case, Lincoln invoked the right of transit, which allowed slaveholders to take their slaves temporarily into free territory. Lincoln also stressed that Matson did not intend to have the slaves remain permanently in Illinois. Even with these arguments, judges in Coles County ruled against Lincoln and the slaves were set free.McKirdy, pp. 74‚Äì86. Donald notes, \\"Neither the Matson case nor the Cromwell case should be taken as an indication of Lincoln's views on slavery; his business was law, not morality.\\"Donald, LIncoln, pp. 103‚Äì104. The right of transit was a legal theory recognized by some of the free states that a slaveowner could take slaves into a free state and retain ownership as long as the intent was not to permanently settle in the free state. Railroads became an important economic force in Illinois in the 1850s. As they expanded they created myriad legal issues regarding \\"charters and franchises; problems relating to right-of-way; problems concerning evaluation and taxation; problems relating to the duties of common carriers and the rights of passengers; problems concerning merger, consolidation, and receivership.\\" Lincoln and other attorneys would soon find that railroad litigation was a major source of income. Like the slave cases, sometimes Lincoln would represent the railroads and sometimes he would represent their adversaries. He had no legal or political agenda that was reflected in his choice of clients. Herndon referred to Lincoln as \\"purely and entirely a case lawyer.\\"Donald, Lincoln, pp. 154‚Äì157. Piatt and DeWitt counties. In one notable 1851 case, Lincoln represented the Alton and Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with James A. Barret, a shareholder. Barret refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest. Lincoln also argued that the newer route proposed by Alton and Sangamon was superior and less expensive, and accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue Barret for his delinquent payment. Lincoln won this case and the Illinois Supreme Court decision was eventually cited by other U.S. courts.Donald, Lincoln, p. 6. The most important civil case for Lincoln was the landmark Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company, also known as the Effie Afton case. America's expansion west, which Lincoln strongly supported, was seen as an economic threat to the river trade, which ran north-to-south, primarily along the Mississippi River. In 1856 a steamboat collided with a bridge built by the Rock Island Railroad between Rock Island, Illinois, and Davenport, Iowa. It was the first railroad bridge to span the Mississippi River. The steamboat owner sued for damages, claiming the bridge was a hazard to navigation, but Lincoln argued in court for the railroad and won, removing a costly impediment to western expansion by establishing the right of land routes to bridge waterways.Burlingame, v. I, pp. 337‚Äì338. Possibly the most notable criminal trial of Lincoln's career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended the son of Lincoln's friend, Jack Armstrong. William \\"Duff\\" Armstrong had been charged with murder. The case became famous for Lincoln's use of judicial notice‚Äîa rare tactic at that time‚Äîto show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 150‚Äì151. Lincoln was involved in more than 5,100 cases in Illinois alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. Lincoln and his partners appeared before the Illinois State Supreme Court more than 400 times. Lincoln the inventor Abraham Lincoln is the only U.S. president to have been awarded a patent for an invention. As a young man, Lincoln took a boatload of merchandise down the Mississippi River from New Salem to New Orleans. At one point the boat slid onto a dam and was set free only after heroic efforts. In later years, while traveling on the Great Lakes, Lincoln's ship ran afoul of a sandbar. The resulting invention consists of a set of bellows attached to the hull of a ship just below the water line. On reaching a shallow place, the bellows are filled with air and the vessel, thus buoyed, is expected to float clear. The invention was never marketed, probably because the extra weight would have increased the probability of running onto sandbars more frequently. Lincoln whittled the model for his patent application with his own hands. It is on display at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History. Patent #6469 for \\"A Device for Buoying Vessels Over Shoals\\" was issued May 22, 1849. In 1858 Lincoln called the introduction of patent laws one of the three most important developments \\"in the world's history.\\" His words, \\"The patent system added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius,\\" are inscribed over the US Commerce Department's north entrance. Courtships, marriage, and family Soon after he moved to New Salem, Lincoln met Ann Rutledge. Historians do not agree on the significance or nature of their relationship, but according to many she was his first and perhaps most passionate love. At first they were probably just close friends, but soon they had reached an understanding that they would be married as soon as Ann had completed her studies at the Female Academy in Jacksonville. Their plans were cut short in the summer of 1835, when what was probably typhoid fever hit New Salem. Ann died on August 25, 1835, and Lincoln went through a period of extreme melancholy that lasted for months.Goodwin, pp. 55‚Äì56. The major basis for the Lincoln-Rutledge relationship comes from oral and written surveys directed by Lincoln's law partner, William Herndon, after Lincoln's death. For documentation on the historiography of this debate, see the two journal articles by Barry Schwartz, \\"Ann Rutledge in American Memory: Social Change and the Erosion of a Romantic Drama\\", at , and John Y. Simon, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Ann Rutledge\\", at .Donald, Lincoln, p. 55. Donald has suggested that Lincoln's decision to study law may also have been tied to his interest in attracting Ann Rutledge. Mary Owens In either 1833 or 1834, Lincoln had met Mary Owens, the sister of his friend Elizabeth Abell, when she was visiting from her home in Kentucky. In 1836, in a conversation with Elizabeth, Lincoln agreed to court Mary if she ever returned to New Salem. Mary returned in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time, but they had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter from Springfield suggesting an end to the relationship. She never replied and the courtship was over.Donald, Lincoln, pp. 67‚Äì69; Thomas, pp. 56‚Äì57 and 69‚Äì70. Donald quotes a key phrase from the letter, \\"I now say, that you can now drop the subject [of marriage], dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me forever, and leave this letter unanswered, without calling forth one accusing murmur from me.\\" Mary Todd Lincoln around 1846 ‚Äì She is described by one Lincoln biographer when she moved to Springfield as \\"a small, pretty young woman of twenty-two years, with beautiful pale, white skin, brown hair, and remarkably vivid blue eyes.\\"Donald, Lincoln, p. 84. In 1839 Mary Todd moved from her family's home in Lexington, Kentucky, to Springfield and the home of her eldest sister, Elizabeth Porter (n√©e Todd) Edwards, and Elizabeth's husband, Ninian W. Edwards, son of Ninian Edwards. Mary was popular in the Springfield social scene, but soon was attracted to Lincoln. Sometime in 1840 the two became engaged. They initially set a January 1, 1841, wedding date, but mutually called it off.Thomas, pp. 85‚Äì87. During the break in their courtship, Lincoln briefly courted Sarah Rickard, whom he had known since 1837. Lincoln proposed marriage to Sarah in 1841 but was rejected. Sarah later said that \\"his peculiar manner and his General deportment would not be likely to fascinate a young girl just entering the society world\\".Burlingame, p. 187. Lincoln still had conflicted feelings concerning Mary Todd. In August 1841 he visited Joshua Speed, his close friend and former roommate, who had moved to Louisville, Kentucky. Lincoln met Speed's fiancee while there, and after his return to Springfield. Speed and Lincoln corresponded over Speed's own doubts about marriage. Lincoln advised Speed and helped convince him to proceed with the marriage. In turn, Speed urged Lincoln to do the same. Lincoln resumed his courtship of Mary, and on November 4, 1842, they were married at the Edwards's home. In a letter written a few days after the wedding, Lincoln wrote, \\"Nothing new here except my marrying, which to me, is matter of profound wonder.\\"Thomas (1952) pp. 88‚Äì89 The couple had four sons. Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, on August 1, 1843. He was their only child to survive into adulthood. Young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont. The other Lincoln sons were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. Edward Baker Lincoln was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield. William Wallace Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862, in Washington, D.C., during President Lincoln's first term. Thomas \\"Tad\\" Lincoln was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871, in Chicago, Illinois. During the American Civil War, four of Mary Todd Lincoln's brothers fought for the Confederacy, with one wounded and another killed in action. Lieutenant David H. Todd, Mary's half-brother, served as commandant of the Libby Prison camp during the war. State and national politics =Campaigning for Congress (1843)= In the winter of 1842‚Äì1843, with the strong encouragement of his wife, Lincoln decided to pursue election to the United States House of Representatives from the newly created Seventh Congressional District. His main rivals were his friends, Edward D. Baker and John J. Hardin. On February 14 Lincoln told a local Whig political leader, \\"if you should hear any one say that Lincoln don't want to go to Congress, I wish you as a personal friend of mine, would tell him you have reason to believe he is mistaken. The truth is, I would like to go very much.\\"Burlingame, pp. 213‚Äì215. Since this was a new district, the term was not for the usual two years. At the end of February the Whigs met in Springfield, where Lincoln wrote the party platform \\"opposing direct federal taxes and endorsing a protective tariff, a national bank, distribution to the states of proceeds from federal land sales, and the convention system of choosing candidates.\\"Burlingame, p. 215. Baker and Lincoln campaigned vigorously throughout March, but Lincoln, believing that Baker had an insurmountable lead, withdrew when the Sangamon County convention was held on March 20. Lincoln was selected as a delegate to the district convention which met on May 1 in Pekin. Although Lincoln worked hard for Baker, Hardin was selected as the Whig candidate, winning by a single vote. Lincoln then initiated a resolution that endorsed Baker for the nomination in two years. The resolution passed, which seemed to set a precedent for a single term with rotation among the party's leaders, and suggested that Lincoln would be next in line after Baker.Burlingame, pp. 215‚Äì218. =Campaigning for Henry Clay (1844)= In 1844 Lincoln campaigned enthusiastically for Henry Clay, the Whig nominee for president and a personal hero of Lincoln. On the campaign trail Lincoln and the other Illinois Whigs emphasized tariff issues, while touting the economic success of the Tariff of 1842 that had been passed in Congress under Whig leadership. Part of the campaign pitted Lincoln in a series of debates against Democrat John Calhoun, a candidate for Congress. Campaigning in Illinois for most of 1844, Lincoln spoke out against the annexation of Texas (a potential slave territory), promoted national and state banks, and opposed a wave of nativism that would become a major political issue a decade later. On the last issue Lincoln declared that \\"the guarantee of the rights of conscience, as found in our Constitution, is most sacred and inviolable, and one that belongs no less to the Catholic, than to the Protestant; and that all attempts to abridge or interfere with these rights, either of Catholic or Protestant, directly or indirectly, have our decided disapprobation, and shall ever have our most effective opposition.\\"Burlingame, pp. 224‚Äì227. Clay's opponent, James K. Polk, carried Illinois and also won the presidency. In Illinois and elsewhere Polk's support for the acquisition of Texas and Oregon seemed to carry the day. Lincoln and many other Whigs blamed the free soil Liberty Party for dividing the vote in New York, which allowed Polk to carry that state and achieve the majority in the electoral college. In responding to an antislavery Whig, who equated voting for Clay, a slaveholder, as \\"do[ing] evil\\", Lincoln asked, \\"If the fruit of electing Mr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension of slavery, could the act of electing him have been evil?\\"Burlingame, pp. 228‚Äì229. =Campaigning for Congress (1846)= Hardin did not run for reelection in 1844; the Whig nomination, as previously agreed, went to Baker, who won election to the seat. Baker agreed not to run for reelection in 1846, but Hardin considered a run for his old seat. Much of the Seventh District was included within the judicial circuit that Lincoln rode, so beginning in September 1845, he began soliciting the support of Whig leaders and editors as he moved through the circuit. Lincoln emphasized that Hardin should be bound by the understanding reached at Pekin in 1843. The debate over what had actually been agreed on in 1843 became public and bitter. In the end Hardin withdrew and Lincoln secured the Whig nomination. The Democrats nominated Peter Cartwright, a circuit-riding Methodist preacher.Burlingame, pp. 231‚Äì235. Lincoln campaigned throughout the district, where he was already well known. Although he was presented with campaign funds $200, Lincoln returned most of the money after the election. Speaking of his actual campaign expenses, Lincoln noted, \\"I made the canvass on my own horse; my entertainment, being at the houses of friends, cost me nothing; and my only outlay was seventy-five cents for a barrel of cider which some farm-hands insisted I should treat them to.\\" There were few newspaper accounts of the election, but the major political issues were the annexation of Texas, which Lincoln opposed as an expansion of slavery; the Mexican War, on which Lincoln was noncommittal; and the Oregon border dispute with Great Britain, which Lincoln avoided.Burlingame, pp. 235‚Äì237. Cartwright avoided joint appearances with Lincoln and initiated a \\"whispering campaign\\" that accused Lincoln of being an infidel and a religious skeptic. Lincoln responded by pointing out that the Illinois constitution had no religious qualifications for office. On July 31 he published a handbill that admitted he was not a member of a specific Christian church, but denied that he was an \\"open scoffer at Christianity\\" or had ever \\"denied the truth of the Scriptures.\\" Cartwright's campaign was effective only in counties where Lincoln was not personally known. Lincoln won the election with 56 percent of the vote, topping the numbers of Hardin (53 percent) and Baker (52 percent) in their elections. Due to the timing of the elections, the Thirtieth Congress did not convene until December 1847.Burlingame, pp. 237‚Äì241. Lincoln in 1846 or 1847 =U.S. House of Representatives (1847‚Äì1849)= A Whig and an admirer of party leader Henry Clay, Lincoln was elected to a term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846, representing the 7th congressional district of Illinois. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. He spoke out against the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, which he attributed to President Polk's desire for \\"military glory‚Äîthat attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.\\" He also challenged the President's claims regarding the Texas boundary and offered Spot Resolutions demanding to know the \\"spot\\" on U.S. soil where blood was first spilt.Congressional Globe, 30th Session (1848) pp. 93‚Äì95 In January 1848 Lincoln was among the eighty-two Whigs who defeated eighty-one Democrats in a procedural vote on an amendment to send a routine resolution back to committee with instructions to add the words \\"a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.\\" The amendment passed, but the bill never reemerged from committee and was never finally voted upon.House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp. 183‚Äì184. Lincoln later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, \\"God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.\\" Two weeks later, President Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress. While no one in Washington paid attention to Lincoln, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered. In Morgan County, Illinois, resolutions were adopted in fervent support of the war and in wrathful denunciation of the \\"treasonable assaults of guerrillas at home; party demagogues; slanderers of the President; defenders of the butchery at the Alamo; traducers of the heroism at San Jacinto\\".Abe Lincoln resource page Warned by his law partner, William Herndon, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, Lincoln decided not to run for reelection. =Campaigning for Zachary Taylor (1848)= In the 1848 presidential election, Lincoln supported war hero Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination and for president in the general election. In abandoning Clay, Lincoln argued that Taylor was the only Whig that was electable. Lincoln attended the Whig National Convention in Philadelphia as a Taylor delegate. Following Taylor's successful nomination, Lincoln urged Taylor to run a campaign emphasizing his personal traits, while leaving the controversial issues to be resolved by Congress. While Congress was in session Lincoln spoke in favor of Taylor on the House floor, and when it adjourned in August, he remained in Washington to assist Whig Executive Committee of Congress in the campaign. In September Lincoln made campaign speeches in Boston and other New England locations. Remembering the election of 1844, Lincoln addressed potential Free Soil voters by saying that the Whigs were equally opposed to slavery and the only issue was how they could most effectively vote against the expansion of slavery. Lincoln argued that a vote for the Free Soil candidate, former President Martin Van Buren, would divide the antislavery vote and give the election to the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass.Donald. Lincoln, pp. 126‚Äì131. With Taylor's victory, the incoming administration, perhaps remembering Lincoln's criticism of Taylor during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, offered Lincoln only the governorship of remote Oregon Territory. Acceptance would end his career in the fast-growing state of Illinois, so he declined., and returned to Springfield, Illinois, where he turned most of his energies to his law practice.Beveridge, (1928) 1: 428‚Äì33; Donald, Lincoln, pp. 140‚Äì143.

Landing of ships In a military invasion conducted by sea, the landing and establishment of a beachhead is a critical phase.

She also campaigned for educational opportunities for the working class, including cheap tickets to Shakespearean drama at the Old Vic Theatre, which she opened in 1880, later managed by her niece Lilian Baylis. Early life Born in St. Pancras, London,Census, England and Wales, 1861 she trained as an artist and joined the Ladies' Co-operative Art Guild in London, run by Caroline Hill, mother of the future housing reformer and founder of the National Trust, Octavia Hill. As Cons's father Frederick Cons was suffering from ill health, she needed to work and the Guild helped her get work as an illuminator as well as restoring manuscripts for John Ruskin. Cons also tried working as a watch engraver, and as a stained glass designer but experienced harassment from men who resented a woman working amongst them. From 1864, Cons worked for Octavia Hill as a rent collector, starting work at Barrett's Court, Oxford Street. Later Cons moved to South London, and in 1879 she established the South London Dwellings Company around Surrey Lodge, Lambeth, near to Waterloo station. Political career In 1889, Cons became the first female alderman on the London County Council (LCC), working alongside the first elected women members Jane Cobden (elected for Bow and Bromley) and Lady Sandhurst (elected for Brixton). The elections were challenged by anti-suffragists, but as Cons had not been elected, she had been asked by the LCC Progressives to become an alderman, and it was difficult to challenge her position. When she voted, however, she became liable for a fine: De Souza v. Cobden, which reached the Court of Appeal in 1891, ruled Cobden and Cons could legally be members of the council but could not vote. After this, Cons' commitment to the cause of women's suffrage was energetic, and she served on the Committee for the Return of Women as Councillors, became Vice-President of the Women's Local Government Society, and Vice President of the Women's Liberal Federation. Educationalist Cons also helped found Swanley Horticultural College (which amalgamated with Wye College later part of Imperial College London, a part of University of London before closure in 2009), in 1892, the first such college for women, and she founded Morley College for working men and women, aided by money donated by Bristol based millionaire manufacturer and philanthropist, Samuel Morley. Cons also founded the Working Girls Home, a hostel in Drury Lane, London, and she established various cr√®ches and clinics for women including what was described as 'the Home for Feeble-Minded girls' at Bodmin. Cultural heritage The Old Vic Theatre In 1880, Emma Cons, re-opened what is now the Old Vic TheatreHamilton, Cecily and Baylis, Lilian.(1926). The Old Vic. Cape, London. in Lambeth, south London, as the Royal Victoria Coffee and Music Hall. It was \\"a cheap and decent place of amusement on strict temperance lines\\". Through this initiative, she brought the plays of William Shakespeare and also opera to working class people. In 1882, Samuel Morley began to take an interest in the affairs of the theatre, and in 1884 he joined the executive committee. He contributed a large amount of money to the scheme, and his business advice was of value. Morley College developed from the lectures given at the Old Vic. In 1896, Cons devoted her autumn holiday in Cyprus to trying to help refugee Armenians, who had fled from persecution in Turkey. In 1908, Cons became the first woman to speak at the Institute of Directors, on behalf of the South London Dwellings Company. Personal life Emma Cons died on 24 July 1912, of a cerebral haemorrhage, at Chippen's Bank, Hever, Kent, home of her friend, Ethel Everest. Her niece, Lilian Baylis (1874‚Äì1937),Schafer, Elizabeth.(2006) Lilian Baylis: A Biography. University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield. assisted in running the Old Vic. Her sister, Ellen Cons (1840‚Äì1920), was also closely associated with many philanthropic schemes, and was one of the governors of the Old Vic. Plaques to Emma Cons Plaques honouring Emma Cons are displayed outside the Old Vic on the corner with Waterloo Road and in the basement area bar.

He took an active role in the fight against the Regime of the Colonels (1967-1974) in Greece. He became famous for his attempt to assassinate dictator Georgios Papadopoulos on 13 August 1968, but also for the torture to which he was subjected during his detention. After the restoration of democracy, he was elected to the Greek parliament as a member of the Centre Union (E.K.).  Biography  = Family, childhood and education = Alexandros Panagoulis was born in the Glyfada neighbourhood of Athens. He was the second son of Vassilios Panagoulis, an officer in the Greek Army, and his wife Athena, and the brother of Georgios Panagoulis, also a Greek Army officer and victim of the Colonels' regime, and Efstathios, who became a politician. His father was from Divri (Lampeia) in Elis (Western Peloponnese) while his mother was from the Ionian island of Lefkada. Panagoulis spent part of his childhood during the Axis occupation of Greece in the Second World War on this island. He studied at the National Technical University of Athens in the School of Electrical Engineering. = Politics = From his teenage years, Alexandros Panagoulis was inspired by democratic values. He joined the youth organisation of the Centre Union party (E.K.), known as O.N.E.K., under the leadership of Georgios Papandreou. The organisation later became known as Hellenic Democratic Youth (E.DI.N.). After the fall of the Colonels' regime and the restoration of parliamentary rule, Panagoulis became the Secretary- General of E.DI.N., on 3 September 1974. = Resistance to the dictatorship = Alexandros Panagoulis participated actively in the fight against the Regime of the Colonels. He deserted from the Greek military because of his democratic convictions and founded the organization National Resistance. He went into self-exile in Cyprus in order to develop a plan of action. He returned to Greece where, with the help of his collaborators, he organized the 13 August 1968 assassination attempt against Papadopoulos, close to Varkiza. The attempt failed and Panagoulis was arrested. In an interview held after his liberation, Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci quoted Panagoulis as saying: I didn‚Äôt want to kill a man. I‚Äôm not capable of killing a man. I wanted to kill a tyrant.Fallaci, Oriana. (1976), Interview with History, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, p. 342. He also stated that he had no regrets about his attempt to kill Papadopoulos as \\"he destroyed the legal government - he abolished the liberties of the people\\".Bernard Nossiter, \\"Papagoulis ordeal of torture\\", The Guardian, 22 August 1973, p. 1. Panagoulis was put on trial by the Military Court on 3 November 1968, condemned to death with other members of National Resistance on 17 November 1968, and subsequently transported to the island of Aegina for the sentence to be carried out. As a result of political pressure from the international community, the junta refrained from executing him and instead incarcerated him at the Bogiati (Boyati) Military Prison near Athens on 25 November 1968. Alexandros Panagoulis refused to cooperate with the junta, and was subjected to physical and psychological torture.Athens news on Panagoulis' interrogation at the ESA torture chambers He escaped from prison on 5 June 1969. He was soon re-arrested and sent temporarily to the camp of Goudi. He was eventually placed in solitary confinement at Bogiati, from which he unsuccessfully attempted to escape on several occasions. He reportedly refused amnesty offers from the junta. In August 1973, after four and a half years in jail, he benefited from a general amnesty that the military regime granted to all political prisoners\\"Greece Completes the Release Of 350 Imprisoned Opponents\\", The New York Times, 23 August 1973. Retrieved 7 April 2020. during a failed attempt by Papadopoulos to liberalize his regime. Panagoulis went into self- exile in Florence, Italy, in order to continue the resistance. There he was hosted by Oriana Fallaci, his companion who was to become his biographer. = Restoration of democracy = After the restoration of democracy during the Metapolitefsi, Alexandros Panagoulis was elected as Member of Parliament for the Center Union - New Forces party in the November 1974 elections. He made also a series of allegations against mainstream politicians who he said had openly or secretly collaborated with the junta. He eventually resigned from his party, after disputes with the leadership, but remained in the parliament as an independent deputy. He stood by his allegations, which he made openly against the then Minister of National Defence, Evangelos Averoff, and others. He reportedly received political pressure and threats against his life in order to persuade him to tone down his allegations. = Death = Grave of Alexandros (Alekos) Panagoulis; First Cemetery of Athens. Panagoulis was killed on 1 May 1976 at the age of 36 in a car accident on Vouliagmenis Avenue in Athens. More precisely, a frantically speeding car with a Corinthian named Stefas behind the wheel diverted Panagoulis' car and forced it to crash.Kostas Chardavelas \\"Atheatos Kosmos\\" broadcast, 20 November 2007, Alter Channel The crash killed Panagoulis almost instantaneously. Cimitero degli Allori, Oriana Fallaci and memorial to Panagoulis A memorial to Panagoulis is near Oriana Fallaci's tomb at Cimitero degli Allori, Florence.  Poetic work  Alexandros Panagoulis was brutally tortured during his incarceration by the junta. Many believe that he maintained his faculties thanks to his will, determination to defend his beliefs, as well as his keen sense of humour. While imprisoned at Bogiati, Panagoulis is said to have written his poetry on the walls of his cell or on small papers, often using his own blood as ink (as told in the poem \\"The Paint\\"). Many of his poems have not survived. However, he managed to smuggle some to friends while in prison, or to recall and rewrite them later. While in prison his first collection in Italian titled Altri seguiranno: poesie e documenti dal carcere di Boyati (Others will Follow: Poetry and Documents of the Prison of Boyati) was published in Palermo in 1972 with an introduction of the Italian politician Ferruccio Parri and the Italian film director and intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini. For this collection Panagoulis was awarded the Viareggio International Prize of Poetry (Premio Viareggio Internazionale) the following year. After his liberation he published his second collection in Milan under the title Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia (I write you from a prison in Greece) with an introduction by Pasolini. He had previously published several collections in Greek, including The Paint (I Bogia). = Poems = :Promise : The teardrops which you will see : flowing from our eyes : you should never believe : signs of despair. : They are only promise : promise for Fight. (Military Prisons of Bogiati, February 1972) Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia, 1974 :My Address : A match as a pen : Blood on the floor as ink : The forgotten gauze cover as paper : But what should I write? : I might just manage my address : This ink is strange; it clots : I write you from a prison : in Greece (Military Prisons of Bogiati, 5 June 1971 ‚Äì After beating) Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia, 1974. :The Paint : I gave life to the walls : a voice I gave them : more friendly so that would become my company : and the guards asked : to know where they could find the paint : The walls of the cell : kept the secret : and the mercenaries searched everywhere : but paint they could not find : Because they did not think for one moment : that they should search into my veins Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia, 1974  Legacy  Alexandros Panagoulis on trial by the junta. To most Greeks, Alexandros Panagoulis's attempted \\"tyrannicide\\" rendered him a symbol of freedom, democracy, human rights, and civil and political freedoms. He constitutes a rare instance of an attempted assassin being elevated to the status of hero of democracy due to his political ethos. Greece issued a postage stamp in his honour (1996) and a prepaid telephone card (1996). However, the Greek state after the fall of the Colonels did not honor him for a long time. For instance, his actions are not mentioned in school textbooks, with very few exceptions. There is still growing suspicion regarding this, given that a minority of active current politicians in Greece are allegedly linked to the Colonels' regime and do not wish to promote Panagoulis' deeds. The Greek Ministry of Culture (under the minister Evangelos Venizelos) refused to contribute ‚Ç¨1,500 in order to facilitate the translated publication of Panagoulis' poems. This has changed during the last years: by 2008, 22 streets in Athens and its suburbs are named after him and a metro station in Athens (Agios Dimitrios, which is close to the place of his death) was renamed to carry his name (Metro Station in Greek). = Film, music, and literature = The life and work of Alexandros Panagoulis attracted the interest of a number of artists. Renowned composer Mikis Theodorakis, also persecuted by the junta, set some of his poems to music. Panagoulis collaborated with composer Ennio Morricone on the 1974 album Non Devi Dimenticare, which featured Panagoulis' poetry and was partly narrated by him (LP RCA PL31238, 1979). Panagoulis was the subject of Panagulis Vive (Panagoulis Lives), a 1980 220-minute, four-part Italian RAI mini-series directed and co-written by Giuseppe Ferrara (IMDB entry). He also participated in a 45-minute 1973 documentary Altri Seguiranno (Others will follow), with photography-montage by Silvano Agosti. The German filmmaker Ebbo Demant broadcast a 1976 documentary \\"Eine Rose ist eine Rose ist eine Rose. Ein Mord ist ein Mord ist ein Mord.\\" There is also Der Fall Panagoulis, a film by German Public TV channel ARD. Panagoulis became the object of study of several researchers. One of the results was Un Uomo (A Man), by Oriana Fallaci.

Rodriguez was born in St Clair, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. After three first-class matches for Trinidad over five seasons, which included a century against the touring Pakistanis in 1957‚Äì58, Rodriguez was selected to tour India and Pakistan with the West Indian team in 1958‚Äì59. Apart from figures of 7 for 90 against Indian Universities he had little success with bat or ball, and did not play in any of the Tests. He played in the Second and Fourth Tests against India in 1961‚Äì62, scoring 50 and taking 3 for 51 with his leg-spin in the Fourth Test at Port of Spain. His tour of England in 1963 was hampered by a cartilage injury,Wisden 1964, p. 272. but after making 93 in over four hours as an opener against Yorkshire he was selected to replace Joey Carew as an opener in the Fifth Test, and made 5 and 28. He played in the Fifth Test against Australia in 1964‚Äì65, but without success. From this point in his first-class career his batting fell away while his bowling improved: from 1965‚Äì66 to 1969‚Äì70 he made 507 runs at 18.10 with only one fifty, but took 69 wickets at 22.21, taking five or more wickets in an innings seven times. For Trinidad against the touring MCC in 1967‚Äì68 he took 6 for 51, and he replaced David Holford for the Fourth Test. He took four wickets, but England won, and he was replaced by Holford. He took 5 for 42 against Windward Islands and 6 for 30 against Barbados in 1968‚Äì69, and in 1969‚Äì70, his last season, 5 for 12 against Guyana and 5 for 76 against Jamaica. All four performances were at Trinidad's home ground of Port of Spain. In all first-class matches at Port of Spain he took 67 wickets at 22.86.Willie Rodriguez bowling by ground Rodriguez also played football and represented the British Caribbean Football Association touring side in 1959. Crystal Palace F.C. described him as \\"a very versatile player specialising at Back and Centre Half (Stopper). Balanced, cultured, and an artist in the use of the ball, he is a model of constructive full back play.\\"http://www.ttfootballhistory.com/node/2166 He managed the West Indies cricket team that toured Australasia in 1979‚Äì80. The Australian leg of the tour was a success, but the New Zealand series, which New Zealand won 1‚Äì0, was marred by poor on-field behaviour by some West Indian players and poor decisions by the New Zealand umpires. Rodriguez complained publicly about the umpiring, claiming that it was heavily biased towards the New Zealanders.R.T.

Plot summary Abel and Morgan, an aristocratic couple, live in a small castle in an indeterminate place and time of civil war. They decide to abandon their home and join a trek of refugees seeking safety. A group of irregulars, led by a woman called \\"The Lieutenant\\" (or \\"Loot\\"), stops them and takes them back to the castle, which the irregulars fortify as a base. They loot the castle, and Morgan is seduced by the Lieutenant. A rival faction attacks the castle with artillery and Abel is taken along with the fighters on a counter- attack. When they return, Abel almost shoots the Lieutenant and there is a violent and nihilistic ending. A Song of Stone tells the frightening story of what happens when the normal rules of society break down. Themes of decadence, violence and war are intertwined with the lives of the rather pompous but lyrical disgraced aristocrat Abel, his partner Morgan, the ruthless Lieutenant and her soldiers with names like \\"Psycho\\", \\"Karma\\" and \\"Deathwish\\". The story is told by Abel, an unreliable narrator. Abel describes Morgan's actions in the second person, mostly when she is in his direct view. As the invaders systematically loot and destroy Abel's family's ancestral home, Abel seems ambivalent to what is happening. Later, when the Lieutenant suggests a memorial for Abel's lifelong family retainer, who has just been killed, Abel and the reader realise that he does not know the servant's surname. The violence of war is described graphically. Literary significance & criticism Stylistically, in its use of an unlikeable unreliable narrator, the book resembles John Banville's The Book of Evidence (1989) and John Fowles' The Collector (1963). As in these books, the idea is that the reader comes to like the narrator a little in spite of their badness. Banks has acknowledged his admiration for J. G. BallardBanks FAQ and this also shows in this book. The geographical and historical background is deliberately vague in the book. There is some stylistic similarity with Banks' novel Inversions (1998). Banks incorporated some previous work about the four medieval elements, and associated them with the four major characters in the book: fire with the Lieutenant, water with the noble, air with the noble's sister, earth with the castle.Richard Puchalsky The book was originally to have been called Feu de Joie, a reference to the custom of firing live rounds into the air as a celebration.

She was born in Chernigov, Russian Empire to Jewish parents, Avram and Reva Aissen. She was the second of three girls. The family emigrated to England in 1912, then Boston in 1922, where the young Seema Aissen found her first job working in a photofinishing lab. She pursued this craft in Boston, New Jersey, New Mexico, California and Tahiti, but she was 95 when she first exhibited her own photographs to the public. In Los Angeles in the 1930s she joined the Film and Photo League, began her lifelong work for racial justice, and formed enduring friendships with artists and political activists including Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham and Woody Guthrie. She assisted Ansel Adams in Yosemite, becoming a close friend of the Adams family. She left Yosemite to marry Jack Weatherwax in 1942, working as a photo technician to support his writing while joining in his left activism in Los Angeles. In 1984 they moved to Santa Cruz, California, where her husband died three weeks after their arrival. After a year of grieving and contemplation, Seema Weatherwax stepped into public life in her own right. Wanting to share her personal collection of art and photographs, she held benefit shows, joined the NAACP and WILPF, was elected to the boards of those two organizations, and was soon well known in Santa Cruz. On the eve of her 94th birthday, she decided that she wanted to do two things before she died; print some of her old negatives and have a new love. Having reflected on the reasons for having put her own creative work in the background, she revised her life story, using work created on the margins of the great photography of the mid-twentieth century to step from a conventional women‚Äôs role into center stage. In 2005, Seema Weatherwax had her fifth public show of her photographs, at Special Collections at the University of California at Santa Cruz, then celebrated her 100th birthday and the release of her biography, Seema‚Äôs Show: A Life on the Left, by Sara Halprin, published by the University of New Mexico Press.

Each record contained the stories from two complete books, one book on each side. The sleeve notes included the same quote from Rev. W. Awdry (see Delys√© recordings, above). The sleeve illustrations were taken directly from the artwork of the original books. The first eight books were again narrated by Johnny Morris. The original Delys√© recordings were re-used. Decca was also the owner of the Argo label, renowned for its audiobooks and other non-music recordings. It was therefore a natural progression to extend the series on this label. New recordings were made for six further books from The Railway Series, starting with Edward the Blue Engine. These stories were narrated by Willie Rushton and the gaps between the tracks included atmospheric (if not always accurate) steam or diesel sound effects. The albums were later released on audio cassette under the same labels. Recordings were produced by Peter Johnson ('Peter John Productions'); with Kaye & Ward Ltd and Third Man Music being identified as owners of the works. Subsequently, Willie Rushton also recorded the remaining books (up to no. 26 Tramway Engines) on the Argo label. These recordings were never released on vinyl, only on audio cassette. =List of recordings= Individual books The Johnny Morris albums were identified as 'Volume 1' to 'Volume 4'; while the Willie Rushton recordings omitted any 'Volume' identity on the front cover.

By comparison, the label on cassette KCSP 559 identifies the sides conventionally ('1' and '2'). Compilations In addition to the individual releases, the recordings were re-released together as compilations on the Argo label. The first compilations were released on two pairs of individually cased cassettes: one pair for the Johnny Morris stories, one pair for Willie Rushton's. The Willie Rushton compilation was released again after Decca's acquisition by PolyGram in 1980, this time as a twin boxed set. The recordings were distributed exclusively by EMI, which was somewhat ironic as EMI was Decca's main competitor for several decades. In addition to the 'new' Argo logo, the EMI logo was displayed on the spine of the case sleeve. The sleeve artwork was a heavily cropped portion of the illustration from the earlier compilation. The picture was based on one from the original books, the artist being credited as \\"Quick on the Draw\\". Decca was shown as copyright holder; Kaye & Ward Ltd and Third Man Music were no longer mentioned in the sleeve notes _First release:_ The Railway Stories - ARGO - SAY 87/1 - two mono cassettes - (date unknown) * Narrator: Johnny Morris *Side 1 - The Three Railway Engines *Side 2 - Thomas the Tank Engine *Side 3 - James the Red Engine: *Side 4 - Tank Engine Thomas Again These tapes were marked as 'a Deles√© Production.'

There were two cassettes released, both using the same Ken Stott-style illustration, the second being labelled 'Volume 2'. Michael Angelis recordings The first new Railway Stories recording in over 10 years was released on CD by BBC Audiobooks in March 2006. It contained adaptations of the first three Railway Series books, and was narrated by Michael Angelis. So far, six such CDs have been released, each containing three volumes from the Railway Series. The CDs are more reflective of the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends TV series than the Railway Series books. This is evident through the cover art, which uses promotional images from the recent series', the storytelling style, and the splicing of several of the songs from the TV series within the stories. The first volume of The Railway Stories that Angelis narrated (consisting of The Three Railway Engines, Thomas the Tank Engine, and James the Red Engine) is available for download at the iTunes Store as well. Angelis has also recorded a number of stories for the \\"Thomas & Friends Audio Range\\". Each book, which is of a similar form to those in the My Thomas Story Library range, is accompanied by a CD containing the story narrated by Angelis, with sound effects and music. Known subjects include: Thomas, Gordon, Henry, James, Toby, Bertie and Terence. Other recordings There have been other audiobooks containing stories from The Railway Series, although most of these are based on stories re-written for the Thomas and Friends TV series. Translations At least one set of stories has been released in Welsh (Tomos A'r Goeden Nadolig). Published by Cyhoeddiadau Mei in September 1988, it is , but no more is known about this recording.

The Bayou as a natural feature drained the swampy land of a good portion of what was to become New Orleans, into Lake Pontchartrain. In its natural state, it extended much farther than today; 18th- and early 19th-century maps show it had tributaries or branches (at least seasonally) reaching into what are now the Broadmoor neighborhood, the New Orleans Central Business District just back from St. Charles Avenue above Lee Circle, the Carrollton neighborhood, the Treme neighborhood, and a branch connecting to Bayou Gentilly. Egrets along Bayou St. John, October, 2005 The portion still in existence today was navigable by canoes and similar small vessels, used by Native Americans since pre-Columbian times. The natives knew the waterway as Bayouk Choupic. There was a portage between the Bayou and the Mississippi River due to the difference in water level between the bayou and the level of the sea, which attracted early French explorers, traders, and trappers, some of whom established a small community there by the late 17th century. In 1701 a small fort was established by the French beside the Lake Pontchartrain end of the Bayou to protect this important route; Fort St. Jean would be known to future generations of New Orleanians as \\"Old Spanish Fort\\". The Bayou and portage were key factors in the selection of the site where the city was founded in 1718, at the River end of the portage route. The portage trail along the bayou became the \\"Grand Route St. John\\" which eventually was replaced by the wide, straight Esplanade Avenue. After the destructive hurricanes of 1778 and 1779, the charitable Bayou plantation owner, Don Andres Almonester, rebuilt the Charity Hospital. Earlier Almonester had founded a leper's hospital near the portage road prior to the construction of the important Carondelet waterway.Freiberg, Edna B. (1980). Bayou St. John in Colonial Louisiana 1699-1803. New Orleans: Harvey Press. pp. 277-9 After the Louisiana purchase in 1803, the Carondelet Canal was dug to connect the back of the city (when it was limited to the strip of land along the Mississippi River) with the Bayou, and the Bayou was dredged to accommodate larger vessels. In the 19th century, an area along Bayou St. John was reputedly the location of many voodoo rituals by Marie Laveau. The Magnolia Bridge over the Bayou continues to serve as a site for such rituals every St. John's Eve. During the first half of the 20th century, commercial use of the Bayou declined and the Carondelet Canal was filled in. Some New Orleanians began living in houseboats on the Bayou. Complaints from residents of nearby neighborhoods and sanitation concerns led to this practice being outlawed in the 1930s. A Works Progress Administration project cleaned up and beautified the area. A lock was installed near the Lake Pontchartrain end. In the summer of 1955, the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board temporarily drained the Bayou, to clean out debris and material that was causing foul odors. Since then, the Bayou has been a picturesque body of water with small earthen levees on either side, forming a narrow park space in the city. From the mid-20th century on, the banks of the Bayou across from City Park became a favorite destination for young couples seeking privacy. The banks of Bayou St. John are an important meeting place for the downtown Mardi Gras Indian tribes for their \\"Super Sunday\\" parade after Carnival. Officially opened in 2015, the Lafitte Greenway now runs along the corridor previously occupied by the Carondelet Canal, with a prominent roundabout at the foot of the Bayou. In conjunction with the Lafitte Greenway, the Bayou has been recognized as part of the EPA's Urban Waters Partnership.

The cast includes Ian McKellen and Deborah Kara Unger. The film received 2 Genie Award nominations in 2005 for Best Achievement in Overall Sound and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Ian McKellen. Plot As a young man, Emile went to England on a university scholarship, leaving behind his brutal older brother Carl and his creative younger brother Freddy to run the family farm in Saskatchewan. Despite promising Freddy that he would return, Emile stayed in England and became an academic, turning his back on his Canadian past and even acquiring an English accent, while his brothers died one after the other in tragic circumstances: Freddy gassing himself with exhaust fumes in his pick-up; Carl dying in a crash in the same pick-up. On his brief return (presumably for Carl's funeral) the authorities think he is there to adopt Carl's young daughter Nadia, but he abandons her simply saying \\"single parent families are not allowed on campus\\". All he is there to do is to resolve the family land-holdings. Invited many decades later to receive an honorary degree by a Canadian university, the retired Emile decides to take an extended visit to Victoria, British Columbia to try to get to know Carl's now adult daughter Nadia (Deborah Kara Unger, who also briefly portrays Carl's wife) who has recently separated from her husband, and her ten-year-old daughter Maria (Theo Crane, who also portrays the ten-year-old Nadia) before it is too late. The discovery of his ancient typewriter amongst Nadia's belongings triggers a series of reveries, half memory, half fantasy, in which Emile's unresolved feelings about the past come back to haunt him.

The first, 'Johnny', looked at a teenager with his life ahead of them, the second, 'Lola', portrayed a middle-aged woman trying to escape an abusive relationship, and 'Emile' is a Proustian examination of memory, imagination, regret, lost roots, and the possibility of redemption and reconciliation, all seen through the eyes of an old man whose life is almost over.https://movie- gazette.com/769/emile References External links  Category:2003 films Category:Canadian films Category:2003 drama films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Carl Bessai Category:Canadian drama films ","title":"Emile (film)"},{"id":"3878681","text":"Michael Conrad \\"Joey\\" Carew (15 September 1937 - 8 January 2011WICB pays tribute to Joey Carew ‚Äì ‚Äúa true stalwart of WI cricket‚Äù) was a West Indian cricketer who played in 19 Tests from 1963 to 1972.

In the mid-11th century it was annotated and some pages rewritten at Lorrha Monastery in County Tipperary, Ireland. Also known as the Lorrha Missal, it is known as the \\"Stowe\\" Missal as it once belonged to the Stowe manuscripts collection formed by George Nugent- Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham at Stowe House. When the collection was bought by the nation in 1883, it and the other Irish manuscripts were handed over to the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, where it remains, catalogued as MS D II 3.Warner, vii ‚Äì viii The cumdach or reliquary case which up to this point had survived together with the book was later transferred, with the rest of the Academy's collection of antiquities, to the National Museum of Ireland (museum number 1883, 614a). The old story was that the manuscript and shrine left Ireland after about 1375, as they were collected on the Continent in the 18th century,Warner, lvii ‚Äì lviii but this appears to be incorrect, and they were found inside a stone wall at Lackeen Castle near Lorrha in the 18th century.Wallace, 234 Manuscript Modern replica of the rear face of the Stowe Missal cumdach. There are 67 folios, measuring . Only the last three folios are in Irish. These contain a short treatise on the Mass and, on the last page, folio 67v, three spells \\"against injury to the eye, thorns, and disease of the urine\\".Irish script website, as √ì Floinn, first page The Latin sections contain extracts from the Gospel of John (f 1), which were probably from another manuscript, then the order of Mass and some special Masses (f 12), the Order of Baptism and of Communion for the newly baptised (f 46v), and the Order for the Visitation of the Sick and Last Rites (f 60).Warner, viii ‚Äì ix The version of the mass used is thought to be older than the manuscript, and reflects the early usage of Celtic Christianity. The five original scribes of the Missal wrote in an angular majuscule script. A more cursive hand was used by a scribe signing himself Mo√©l Ca√≠ch (f 37) who revised several pages. A few initials are decorated, notably the one on f 1, and the extracts from John contain a \\"crude\\" full page evangelist portrait of John with his symbol of the eagle, unusually placed at the end (f 11v), with panels of Insular interlace on either side of the standing figure, and the eagle above. Apart from the eagle, it is rather similar to the portrait of John in the Book of Mulling.Warner, xi and Plate IX; image Cumdach Drawing of the older face of the cumdach by Margaret Stokes The manuscript retains its cumdach or book-shrine, a distinctively Irish form of reliquary case for books associated with an important religious figure; this is one of only five early examples. It is a box with metalwork plaques attached with nails to a wooden core of oak. The metalwork is elaborately decorated, with some animal and human figures, and one face and the sides probably date to between 1027 and 1033, on the basis of inscriptions recording its donation and making, while the other face is later, and can be dated to about 1375, again from its inscriptions.√ì Floinn, \\"Description\\"; Warner, xliv ‚Äì lvii, Plates I ‚Äì VI; Stokes, 78; older face from Flickr The older \\"lower\\" face, which is currently detached from the case, is in silver- gilt copper alloy, with a large cross inside a border that carries the inscription in Irish, which also runs along the arms of the cross. The centre of the cross was later replaced (\\"severely embellished\\" as the National Museum put it),Wallace 234 probably at the same time as the later face, by a setting for a large stone (now missing) with four lobed sections, similar to the centre of the lower face. The inscription has missing sections because of this, but can mostly be reconstructed: \\"It asks for a prayer for the abbot of Lorrha, Mathgamain Ua Cathail (+1037) and for Find Ua D√∫ngalaigh, king of M√∫scraige T√≠re (+1033). It also mentions Donnchadh mac Briain, styled 'king of Ireland' and Mac Raith Ua Donnchada, king of the Eoganacht of Cashel (+1052) as well as the name of the maker, Donnchadh Ua Tacc√°in [a monk] 'of the community of Cluain (Clonmacnoise)'.\\"√ì Floinn The four spaces between cross and border have panels of geometric openwork decoration, and there are small panels with knotwork decoration at the corners of the border and inside the curved ends of the cross members.Wallace, 219, 234, 253; Stokes, 74 The sides have unsilvered copper alloy plaques with figures of angels, animals, clergy and warriors, set in decorative backgrounds. The newer \\"upper\\" face, of silver-gilt, is again centred on a cross with a large oval rock crystal stone at the centre and lobed surrounds, and other gems. The inscription, engraved on plain silver plaques, runs round the border and the spaces between cross and border have four engraved figures of the crucified Christ, Virgin and Child, a bishop making a blessing gesture, and a cleric holding a book (possibly St John). The inscription \\"invokes a prayer for Pilib √ì Ceinn√©idigh, 'king of Ormond' and his wife √Åine, both of whom died in 1381. It also refers to Giolla Ruadh√°n √ì Mac√°in, abbot of the Augustinian priory of Lorrha and the maker, Domhnall √ì Tolairi\\".√ì Floinn; Wallace, 271, 294 Black niello is used to bring out the engraved lines of the inscription and figures, and the technique is very similar to that of the later work on the Shrine of Saint Patrick's Tooth (also in the NMI), which was also given a makeover in the 1370s, for a patron some 50 km from Lorrha. They were probably added to by the same artist, something that can only rarely be seen in the few survivals of medieval goldsmith's work.Wallace, 262‚Äì263 File:Stowe Missal fol 11 v.jpgEvangelist portrait fol 11 v File:Stowe Missal fol. 12 r.jpgFol. 12 r File:Book or Shrine, Cumdach of the Stowe Missal MET tem12412s1 (cropped).jpgModern replica of the older face of the cumdach Notes References *√ì Floinn, Raghnall, \\"Description\\" of the \\"Book-shrine\\" on The Stowe Missal, from \\"Irish Script on Screen\\", with good images and catalogue information ‚Äì select \\"Royal Irish Academy\\" from drop-down \\"collections\\" menu at bottom left, then select \\"Stowe Missal\\" from the next menu. *Stokes, Margaret, Early Christian Art in Ireland, 1887, 2004 photo-reprint, Kessinger Publishing, , , google books *Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds.

Moldovenism is a political term used to refer to the support and promotion of the Moldovan identity and Moldovan culture primarily by the opponents of such ideas. Some of its supporters ascribe this identity to the medieval Principality of Moldavia. Others, in order to explain the current differences between Romanian-speaking inhabitants of the two banks of the Prut river, ascribe it to the long incorporation of Bessarabia in the Russian Empire and the USSR. The opponents, on the contrary, claim that Moldovans and Romanians are a single ethnic group and that the Moldovan identity was artificially created by the Soviet Union. Supporters of Moldovan identity contend that the people of Moldavia historically self-identified as \\"Moldavian\\" before the notion of \\"Romanian\\" became widespread. The belief that Romanians and Moldovans in Bessarabia and the Moldavian ASSR (MASSR) formed two separate ethnonational groups, speaking different languages and possessing separate historical and cultural traits was also endorsed by the Soviet Union.Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 62 Historical development =Creation of Moldavian ASSR= In 1812 the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Bucharest (1812), by which Russia annexed the eastern part of the medieval Principality of Moldavia. This territory became known as Bessarabia. Between 1859 and 1866, Principality of Moldavia and the neighbouring Principality of Wallachia united into a single country called Romania. Histoire du congr√®s de Paris, Edouard Gourdon (1857) In 1917, when the Russian Empire was disintegrating, a Moldavian Democratic Republic was formed in Bessarabia. In 1918, after the Romanian army gained control of the region, Sfatul »öƒÉrii proclaimed the independence of the Moldavian Republic and, later, voted for the union with Romania. The Soviet Russia contested the outcome of these events and, in May 1919, proclaimed the Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic as a government in exile. After the Soviet-organized Tatarbunary Uprising failed, in 1924 a Moldavian ASSR (MASSR) was created within the Ukrainian SSR, just east of the river Dniester that then marked the boundary between Romania and the Soviet Union. For the purpose of giving MASSR its own identity separate from Romania, Soviet authorities declared the variety spoken by the majority of Moldavians to be \\"Moldavian language\\".Grenoble 2003, pp 89-93Ana Core≈£chi, Ana Pascaru, Cynthia Stevens, The Republic of Moldova: dimensions of the Gagauz socio- linguistic model , Linguapax Institute.Elizabeth Blackwell, The Sovietization of Moldova , College of Political Science, James Madison UniversityA Country Study: Moldova (Language section), Library of the US Congress. The intellectual elites of the MASSR were asked to standardise a Moldovan literary language based on the local dialects of MASSR, which are similar to Romanian. Until the 1920s the Russians did not argue that Moldovans and their neighbors in the Romanian Principalities somehow formed nations.Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 26 One observer wrote in 1846 in the journal of the Russian foreign ministry that ‚Äúthe inhabitants of upper Bessarabia are essentially Romanians, that is, a mixture of Slavs and Romans, and sons of the Greek Orthodox Church\\". In May 1917, at a congress of Bessarabian teachers, a group protested against being called \\"Romanians\\", affirming they were \\"Moldovans\\".Stuart J. Kaufman, Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War, Cornell University Press, 2001, , pg. 134 Representatives of the Romanian-speaking population living in Podolia, and Kherson participated in the Bessarabian national movement in 1917 and early 1918, agitating for incorporation of the territory across Dniester into the Greater Romanian Kingdom. The Romanian government never took significant interest in these demands, which would have implied large-scale military operations, and settled in the end to leave behind those areas, which became part of Soviet Ukraine after the Russian Civil War.Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 180 The calls from Transnistrian emigres continued into the 1920s asking for Romania to fund schools in the region as there were schools and cultural organizations in regions inhabited by speakers of cognate Latin languages in the Balkans. Refugees flooded across the Dniester and special funds were put aside for housing and education. Nichita SmochinƒÉ, an educator settled in Paris, founded the Associations of Transnistrian Romanians in order to assist 20,000 refugees from across the Dniester, and welcomed the creation of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Republic.Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 181 Pavel Chior, the MASSR People's Commissar of Education, argued that literary Romanian borrowed too many French language words during its standardization in the 19th century. According to Chior, this made it incomprehensible to the peasants both in the MASSR and Romania, demonstrating the division between the \\"ruling class\\" and the \\"exploited class\\".King, p.64 Soviet linguist M. V. Sergievsky studied linguistic variation in the MASSR and identified two dialects. One, similar to the spoken variety in Bessarabia, was chosen as the standard, to pave the way for the \\"liberation of the Bessarabians\\". Gabriel Buciu≈ücanu, a Socialist Revolutionary member of Sfatul »öƒÉrii who opposed the union with Romania, wrote a new grammar compendium in 1925, but it was considered too similar to standard Romanian grammar, and was quickly pulled out of circulation. =Romanizators and autochthonists= The 1920 map of Romania (includes Bessarabia). East of it, within the Soviet Union, the Moldavian ASSR (1924‚Äì1940) was created. In the 1920s, there was a dispute among the Soviet linguists between supporters (\\"Romanizators\\" or \\"Romanists\\") and opponents (\\"autochthonists\\", Russian: —Å–∞–º–æ–±—ã—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏) of the convergence of the Moldavian and Romanian. The \\"autochthonists\\" strove to base the literary Moldovan on local dialects from the left bank of the Dniester. Neologisms, mostly from Russian, were created to cover technical areas that had no native equivalent.Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 69 Then in February 1932, communists in the MASSR received a directive from the Communist Party of Ukraine to switch Moldovan writing to the Latin alphabet. This was part of the massive Latinization campaign of minority languages in the USSR, based on the theory of Soviet linguist Nikolai Marr postulating the convergence to a single world language, expected to be a means of communication in the future classless society (Communism). This directive was passively sabotaged by the \\"autochthonist\\" majority, until Stanislav Kosior (General Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party) and several MASSR communists visited Joseph Stalin ‚Äî who reportedly insisted on faster Latinization with the ultimate goal of the convergence of Moldavian and Romanian cultures, hinting at the possibility of a future reunion of Moldova and Romania within the Soviet state. Nevertheless, resistance to Romanization among communist activists persisted, and after 1933, a number of prominent \\"autochthonists\\" were repressed, their books destroyed, and their neologisms banned. After the infamous February‚ÄìMarch (1937) Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union plenum, which escalated the Great Purge, both \\"Romanizators\\" and \\"autochthonists\\" were declared \\"imperialist spies\\": \\"autochthonists\\", because they sabotaged the Latinization, and \\"Romanizators\\", because they were \\"agents of boyar Romania\\" (\\"–ë–æ—è—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –†—É–º—ã–Ω–∏—è\\"), i.e. anti-Soviet. In February 1938, Moldovan communists issued a declaration transferring Moldovan writing to the Cyrillic alphabet once again, which in August 1939 was made into a law of the Moldavian ASSR, and after 1940, of the Moldavian SSR. The motivation given was that the Latinization was used by \\"bourgeois-nationalist elements\\" to \\"distance the Moldavian populace from the Ukrainian and Russian ones, with the ultimate goal of the separation of Soviet Moldavia from the USSR\\". =Moldovans in Soviet Moldova= In June 1940 Bessarabia was occupied by the Soviet Union. Most of Bessarabia and about half of the MASSR were merged into a newly created Moldavian SSR, which became the fifteenth union republic of the USSR. A year later, in 1941, Romania attacked the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa and retook Bessarabia. Between 1941 and 1944, Romania also occupied the territory between the Dniester and Bug rivers (historic Transnistria). By 1944 the Soviets had taken back all the territories they lost in 1941, which remained in the Soviet Union on until the latter's dissolution in 1991. During the first years of Soviet occupation, the term \\"Romanian language\\" was forbidden. The official language for use in Moldovan schools throughout the entire MSSR (both in Bessarabia and Transnistria) during Stalinist period was based on a local variety spoken in some areas of the former MASSR. The Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Moldova is assessing this period. In 1956, during the Nikita Khrushchev's rehabilitation of the victims of Stalinist repressions, a special report was issued about the state of the Moldavian language. The report stated, in part, that the discussions of 1920-30s between the two tendencies had been mostly non-scientific, since there were very few linguists in the republic; and that the grammar and the basic lexicon of the literary Romanian and Moldovan languages are identical, while differences are secondary and nonessential. Because the political situation in the People's Republic of Romania was now pro-Soviet, the planned convergence of the Romanian and Moldovan languages was once again approved. During the entire period of Soviet rule, Moldovan speakers were encouraged to learn the Russian language as a prerequisite for access to higher education, social status and political power. Transfers of territory and population movements, including deportations of locals and state-encouraged immigration from the rest of the USSR, shifted the ethnic and linguistic makeup of the republic. By the late 1970s, the number of Russian speakers in the Moldavian SSR had greatly increased. These changes contributed to the proliferation of Russian loanwords in the spoken Moldovan. While some Soviet linguists continued to deny the existence of a distinct Moldovan language,Ziua, 22 noiembrie 2007: Acum o jumatate de secol, doi renumiti profesori ai Universitatii din Moscova, romanistul R.A. Budagov si slavistul S.B. Bernstein, au trimis revistei Voprosi jazakoznanija (Probleme de lingvistica) articolul cu privire la unitatea de limba romano-moldoveneasca, articol ce a fost publicat abia in 1988, in revista Nistru. Cei doi savanti aratau in mod clar ca s-au irosit multe forte si mult timp pentru a demonstra teza eronata cum ca moldovenii si romanii vorbesc limbi romanice inrudite, dar diferite. Dovezi in favoarea acestei teze n-au existat si nu pot exista\\", se arata in comunicat. a new generation of Soviet linguists revived the debate in the 1970s. For example, one linguist, Iliasenco, compared the Romanian and Moldovan translations of a Leonid Brezhnev speech from Russian and used them as a proof for the existence of two different languages. Mikhail Bruchis analysed this claim, and noticed that all the words of both translations are found in both dictionaries. Also, Iliasenco implied that \\"Moldovan\\" preferred synthetic syntagms, while \\"Romanian\\" preferred analytic ones. However, this claim was also proven wrong, as a book of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu (the political leader of Romania at the time) uses mostly \\"Moldovan\\" synthetic syntagms, while a book by Ivan Bodiul (the secretary of the Moldavian SSR) uses mostly \\"Romanian\\" analytic syntagms. Bruchis' conclusion was that both translations were within the limits of the Romanian language.Michael Bruchis. The Language Policy of the CPSU and the Linguistic Situation in Soviet Moldavia, in Soviet Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1. (Jan., 1984), pp. 118-119. Debates in independent Moldova The debate surrounding the ethnicity of Moldovans has resurfaced after the collapse of the USSR. One side, rallying many prominent Moldovan intellectuals, such as Grigore Vieru, Eugen Doga or Constantin Tanase, argues that Moldovans have always been Romanians, even if the modern history separated them from the rest of Romanians. Moldovanism is thus regarded as a Soviet attempt to create an artificial nationality with the goal of ethnic assimilation of Romanians living in the Soviet Union.Dennis Deletant, ‚ÄúLanguage Policy and Linguistic Trends in the Republic of Moldavia, 1924-1992‚Äù in Studies in Moldovan: the History, Culture, Language and Contemporary Politics of the People of Moldova, p. 53-54. The other side emphasizes the distinctiveness of Moldovans such as Moldovan historian and politician Victor Stepaniuc states that Moldovans have always been different from Romanians. Some claim that, for Bessarabian Moldovans, the long isolation from the rest of Romanians (between 1812‚Äì1918, after 1940) was \\"more than ample time [...] to develop [their] own separate national identity\\". After collaborating for several years with the Pan-Romanian Popular Front of Moldova, acting president Mircea Snegur moved close to the Agrarian Party of Moldova, a strong supporter of the Moldovan identity. During his visit to Bucharest in February 1991, he talked about \\"Romanians on both banks of the Prut river\\",Problems, Progress and Prospects in a Post-Soviet Borderland: The Republic of Moldova Trevor Waters. \\"In an address to the Romanian parliament in February 1991 (on the first official visit to Romania by any leader from Soviet Moldova since its annexation), the then President Snegur strongly affirmed the common Moldovan- Romanian identity, noting that ‚ÄúWe have the same history and speak the same language‚Äù, and referred to ‚ÄúRomanians on both sides of the River Prut.‚Äù\\" however, during the presidential campaign in 1994, Snegur stressed in the speech Our Home the existence of a distinct Moldovan nation as the foundation of the state. The speech was immediately condemned by the intellectuals. Representatives of The Writers' Union, the Institute of Linguistics, the Institute of History, Chisinau State University, and other institutions declared the speech an affront to the true identity of the republic's ethnic majority and an attempt to further ‚Äúan invention of the Communist regime‚Äù by erecting a ‚Äúbarrier to authentic Romanian culture‚Äù. Nevertheless, Snegur's stance helped the Agrarian Party of Moldova win an absolute majority in the Parliament.Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 157 =Moldovan self-consciousness= A poll conducted in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chisinau in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents were asked to rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different. The results varied significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, while 33% of the young respondents (ages 18‚Äì29) chose the same or very similar and 44% different or very different, among the senior respondents (aged over 60) the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. The proportion of those who chose the same or very similar identity was higher than the average among the native speakers of Romanian/Moldovan (30%), among the urban dwellers (30%), among those with higher education (36%), and among the residents of the capital city (42%). Biometrul Socio Politic, October 2009 According to a study conducted in the Republic of Moldova in May 1998, when the self-declared Moldovans were asked to relate the Romanian and Moldovan identities, 55% considered them somewhat different, 26% very different and less than 5% identical.Pal Kolsto, Hans Olav Melberg, National Integration and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Societies: The Cases of Estonia and Moldova, pg. 31-34, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2002, A survey carried out in the Republic of Moldova by William Crowther in 1992 showed that 87% of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose to identify themselves as \\"Moldovans\\", rather than \\"Romanians\\".Charles King, \\"The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture\\", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 159 The 2004 census results reported that out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova (without Transnistria), 75.81% declared themselves Moldovans and only 2.17% Romanians.National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: 2004 Census results in Moldova A group of international observers considered the census was generally conducted in a professional manner, although they reported several cases when enumerators encouraged respondents to declare themselves Moldovans rather than Romanians.Experts Offering to Consult the National Statistics Bureau in Evaluation of the Census Data, Moldova Azi, May 19, 2005, story attributed to AP Flux.

Retrieved January 21, 2009. The 2014 census results reported that out of the 2,998,235 people living in Moldova (without Transnistria), 75.1% declared themselves Moldovans and 7.0% Romanians. The information about the language they usually speak indicate that 54.6% consider the language to be Moldovan and 24.0% consider it to be Romanian. =Political implications= On 19 December 2003, the Moldovan Parliament, dominated by the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, adopted a non-judicial political documentDecizia Curtii Constitutionale nr.10/25.07.2013 called \\"The Concept of National Policy of the Republic of Moldova\\". The document claims that: * there are two different peoples (Romanians and Moldovans) that share a common literary language. \\"Sharing their source, having a common basic lexical foundation, the national Moldovan language and the national Romanian language each preserve their language name as an identifier of every nation: Moldovan and Romanian.\\" * Romanians are an ethnic minority in Moldova. * the Republic of Moldova is the rightful successor of the medieval Principality of Moldova. This document faced criticism in Moldova as being \\"anti-European\\" and contradicting the Constitution which states that \\"no ideology may be adopted as official state ideology\\".Gribincea A., Grecu, M. The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova, UNHCR. Moldovan historian Gheorghe E. Cojocaru, in his book Cominternul si originile Moldovenismului, claims that \\"Moldovanism\\" and its dissemination among the Romance speakers living east of the Prut are of Soviet origin. On the occasion, Moldovan politician and historian Alexandru Mo≈üanu claimed that \\"The Moldovanist ideology appeared as a policy of ethnic assimilation of the Romanians from Transnistria, then from the entire space of the former Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. And now from the Republic of Moldova.\\" On January 22, 2010, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the book in Bucharest.

A growth cone is a large actin-supported extension of a developing or regenerating neurite seeking its synaptic target. Their existence was originally proposed by Spanish histologist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal based upon stationary images he observed under the microscope. He first described the growth cone based on fixed cells as \\"a concentration of protoplasm of conical form, endowed with amoeboid movements\\" (Cajal, 1890). Growth cones are situated on the tips of neurites, either dendrites or axons, of the nerve cell. The sensory, motor, integrative, and adaptive functions of growing axons and dendrites are all contained within this specialized structure. Structure Two fluorescently-labeled growth cones. The growth cone (green) on the left is an example of a ‚Äúfilopodial‚Äù growth cone, while the one on the right is a ‚Äúlamellipodial‚Äù growth cone. Typically, growth cones have both structures, but with varying sizes and numbers of each. The morphology of the growth cone can be easily described by using the hand as an analogy. The fine extensions of the growth cone are pointed filopodia known as microspikes. The filopodia are like the \\"fingers\\" of the growth cone; they contain bundles of actin filaments (F-actin) that give them shape and support. Filopodia are the dominant structures in growth cones, and they appear as narrow cylindrical extensions which can extend several micrometres beyond the edge of the growth cone. The filopodia are bound by a membrane which contains receptors, and cell adhesion molecules that are important for axon growth and guidance. In between filopodia‚Äîmuch like the webbing of the hands‚Äîare the \\"lamellipodia\\". These are flat regions of dense actin meshwork instead of bundled F-actin as in filopodia. They often appear adjacent to the leading edge of the growth cone and are positioned between two filopodia, giving them a \\"veil-like\\" appearance. In growth cones, new filopodia usually emerge from these inter-filopodial veils. The growth cone is described in terms of three regions: the peripheral (P) domain, the transitional (T) domain, and the central (C) domain. The peripheral domain is the thin region surrounding the outer edge of the growth cone. It is composed primarily of an actin-based cytoskeleton, and contains the lamellipodia and filopodia which are highly dynamic. Microtubules, however, are known to transiently enter the peripheral region via a process called dynamic instability. The central domain is located in the center of the growth cone nearest to the axon. This region is composed primarily of a microtubule-based cytoskeleton, is generally thicker, and contains many organelles and vesicles of various sizes. The transitional domain is the region located in the thin band between the central and peripheral domains. Growth cones are molecularly specialized, with transcriptomes and proteomes that are distinct from those of their parent cell bodies. There are many cytoskeletal-associated proteins, which perform a variety of duties within the growth cone, such as anchoring actin and microtubules to each other, to the membrane, and to other cytoskeletal components. Some of these components include molecular motors that generate force within the growth cone and membrane-bound vesicles which are transported in and out of the growth cone via microtubules. Some examples of cytoskeletal- associated proteins are fascin and filamins (actin bundling), talin (actin anchoring), myosin (vesicle transport), and mDia (microtubule-actin linking). Axon branching and outgrowth The highly dynamic nature of growth cones allows them to respond to the surrounding environment by rapidly changing direction and branching in response to various stimuli. There are three stages of axon outgrowth, which are termed: protrusion, engorgement, and consolidation. During protrusion, there is a rapid extension of filopodia and lamellar extensions along the leading edge of the growth cone. Engorgement follows when the filopodia move to the lateral edges of the growth cone, and microtubules invade further into the growth cone, bringing vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, consolidation occurs when the F-actin at the neck of the growth cone depolymerizes and the filopodia retract. The membrane then shrinks to form a cylindrical axon shaft around the bundle of microtubules. One form of axon branching also occurs via the same process, except that the growth cone ‚Äúsplits‚Äù during the engorgement phase. This results in the bifurcation of the main axon. An additional form of axon branching is termed collateral (or interstitial) branching;. Collateral branching, unlike axon bifurcations, involves the formation of a new branch from the established axon shaft and is independent of the growth cone at the tip of the growing axon. In this mechanism, the axon initially generates a filopodium or lamellipodium which following invasion by axonal microtubules can then develop further into a branch extending perpendicular from the axon shaft. Established collateral branches, like the main axon, exhibit a growth cone and develop independently of the main axon tip. Overall, axon elongation is the product of a process known as tip growth. In this process, new material is added at the growth cone while the remainder of the axonal cytoskeleton remains stationary. This occurs via two processes: cytoskeletal-based dynamics and mechanical tension. With cytoskeletal dynamics, microtubules polymerize into the growth cone and deliver vital components. Mechanical tension occurs when the membrane is stretched due to force generation by molecular motors in the growth cone and strong adhesions to the substrate along the axon. In general, rapidly growing growth cones are small and have a large degree of stretching, while slow moving or paused growth cones are very large and have a low degree of stretching. The growth cones are continually being built up through construction of the actin microfilaments and extension of the plasma membrane via vesicle fusion. The actin filaments depolymerize and disassemble on the proximal end to allow free monomers to migrate to the leading edge (distal end) of the actin filament where it can polymerize and thus reattach. Actin filaments are also constantly being transported away from the leading edge by a myosin-motor driven process known as retrograde F-actin flow. The actin filaments are polymerized in the peripheral region and then transported backward to the transitional region, where the filaments are depolymerized; thus freeing the monomers to repeat the cycle. This is different from actin treadmilling since the entire protein moves. If the protein were to simply treadmill, the monomers would depolymerize from one end and polymerize onto the other while the protein itself does not move. The growth capacity of the axons lies in the microtubules which are located just beyond the actin filaments. Microtubules can rapidly polymerize into and thus ‚Äúprobe‚Äù the actin-rich peripheral region of the growth cone. When this happens, the polymerizing ends of microtubules come into contact with F-actin adhesion sites, where microtubule tip-associated proteins act as \\"ligands\\". Laminins of the basal membrane interact with the integrins of the growth cone to promote the forward movement of the growth cone. Additionally, axon outgrowth is also supported by the stabilization of the proximal ends of microtubules, which provide the structural support for the axon. Axon guidance Model of growth cone-mediated axon guidance. From left to right, this model describes how the cytoskeleton responds and reorganizes to grow towards a positive stimulus (+) detected by receptors in the growth cone or away from a negative stimulus (-). Movement of the axons is controlled by an integration of its sensory and motor function (described above) which is established through second messengers such as calcium and cyclic nucleotides. The sensory function of axons is dependent on cues from the extracellular matrix which can be either attractive or repulsive, thus helping to guide the axon away from certain paths and attracting them to their proper target destinations. Attractive cues inhibit retrograde flow of the actin filaments and promote their assembly whereas repulsive cues have the exact opposite effect. Actin stabilizing proteins are also involved and are essential for continued protrusion of filopodia and lamellipodia in the presence of attractive cues, while actin destabilizing proteins are involved in the presence of a repulsive cue. A similar process is involved with microtubules. In the presence of an attractive cue on one side of the growth cone, specific microtubules are targeted on that side by microtubule stabilizing proteins, resulting in growth cone turning in the direction of the positive stimulus. With repulsive cues, the opposite is true: microtubule stabilization is favored on the opposite side of the growth cone as the negative stimulus resulting in the growth cone turning away from the repellent. This process coupled with actin-associated processes result in the overall directed growth of an axon. Growth cone receptors detect the presence of axon guidance molecules such as Netrin, Slit, Ephrins, and Semaphorins. It has more recently been shown that cell fate determinants such as Wnt or Shh can also act as guidance cues. The same guidance cue can act as an attractant or a repellent, depending on context. A prime example of this is Netrin-1, which signals attraction through the DCC receptor and repulsion through the Unc-5 receptor. Furthermore, it has been discovered that these same molecules are involved in guiding vessel growth. Axon guidance directs the initial wiring of the nervous system and is also important in axonal regeneration following an injury.

It revolved around the afterlives of some of the world's most famous dead rock stars, including Freddie Mercury, John Denver, The Notorious B.I.G., Kurt Cobain and Marc Bolan. Bolan was replaced in the second series by John Lennon. Forced to share a house in limbo, they try to cope with isolation, clashing personalities and relentless boredom. The show aired as part of Channel 4's late-night 4 Music. Often, segments of the episode would appear as links between videos, reminiscent of Beavis and Butthead. On average, each episode from the first series was 5 minutes long, while each episode from the second series was 10 minutes long. The characters occupy a huge rundown house in a bleak, depressing landscape with nothing around seemingly for miles. Much of the comedy comes from each character's frustrations with their surroundings, associates and inability to do anything further now they're dead. Characters =Freddie Mercury= Extremely theatrical and flamboyant, Freddie is highly strung and quick to anger. He openly despises all of his housemates, especially the Notorious B.I.G. He keeps a cat called Galileo. =John Denver= The group's only optimist, John is sweet and na√Øve, convinced there is some hope of emerging from limbo. As such he is constantly abused and berated by other more cynical housemates. His love of peace has led him to severely suppress his anger. John can often be heard using phrases used in Scooby-Doo, such as \\"jinkies!\\" =Kurt Cobain= Paranoid and depressed, Kurt is so tired of life he owns a pad of pre-printed suicide notes that he can stick anywhere like Post-it notes. Nevertheless, he is quite friendly, especially with Biggie and John. Kurt's dream is to be series champion on the UK gameshow Fifteen to One. =The Notorious B.I.G.= Known as \\"Biggie\\" within the house, Notorious is especially depressed with limbo, since he has had to leave all the trappings of his hip-hop lifestyle behind. Sometimes his sexual frustration is so great he has to take it out on the house's postman, a constantly shuddering Sid Vicious. He cannot stand Freddie Mercury, and would have shot him long ago if his gun was capable of doing anything. =Marc Bolan= The house's resident hippie, elfin Marc is only capable of talking in twee rhyming couplets in the style of his lyrics. Frustrated with his hippie sensibilities and feyness, when Satan Davina McCall demands one of their number join her in hell Big Brother style, the group agree on Marc. They are then horrified to discover his replacement is the peace-and-love obsessed John Lennon. =John Lennon= John pompous and pretentious, with a droning Scouse voice.

It was purported to have been the furthest west outpost of New France. The fort was named after the Governor General of New France at the time, Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonqui√®re, Marquis de la Jonqui√®re, by Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, western commander of the French (1750-1753). There is no surviving record of its exact location, nor physical evidence, but it was most likely located near Nipawin, Saskatchewan. Construction Fort La Jonqui√®re and Fort de la Corne were the two forts established by the French along the Saskatchewan in the 20 years between the end of La V√©rendrye's push west from Lake Superior in 1743 and the fall of New France in 1763. Saint-Pierre was the second of the four western commanders who followed La V√©rendrye. According to his memoir he ordered fur trader and explorer Joseph-Claude Boucher, Chevalier de Niverville, to travel 300 lieues (leagues) up the Saskatchewan from Fort Paskoya, thought to be near the sources of the Missouri and streams running west to the Pacific, and build a fort there. Ten Frenchmen in two canoes‚ÄîNiverville himself was too ill to travel‚Äîset out from Fort Paskoya on 29 May 1751. Saint-Pierre's memoirs are the only reference to the fort being named \\"La Jonqui√®re\\": Saint-Pierre wrote that he left Fort La Reine on November 14, 1751 to visit Fort La Jonqui√®re, but never reached it. He was stopped along the way by a pair of Frenchmen and four Indians who informed him that Niverville was still ill, and that the \\"Yhach√©Illini/Jhatcheouilini\\" Indians who were to have been his guides through \\"Kinongeouilini\\" (Ojibwe) territory were attacked by a band of \\"Assinibouels\\" (Assiniboine). Saint-Pierre returned to Fort La Reine to overwinter, in the spring of 1752 was recalled to Canada by the new Governor General the Marquis Duquesne, and died in combat in 1755. Historical record No other period sources substantiate Fort La Jonqui√®re's location. In a 1757 address Louis Antoine de Bougainville, Montcalm's aide-de-camp during the Seven Years' War, listed all of the French \\"Western Sea\\" outposts at the time: Saint-Pierre, Saint-Charles, La Reine, Dauphin, Bourbon, Paskoya and des Prairies. Fort La Jonqui√®re was conspicuously absent from his list. After the war Guy Carleton, Governor of Quebec, wrote a letter to Lord Shelburne on 2 March 1768 describing the reach of French fur trade commerce as of 1754. Of the westernmost of the French forts, Carleton wrote, \\"A fort was erected one hundred leagues beyond Paskoyat, but I have not information enough to put either the fort or the full extent of the river on the map...\\" The reports and maps of the Hudson's Bay Company surveyors who explored along the Saskatchewan River in the latter half of the 18th Century‚ÄîAnthony Henday in 1755, Matthew Cocking in 1772, Peter Fidler in 1792‚Äînever mentioned any French forts west of Fort de la Corne. The map created by the North West Company's Peter Pond in 1785 marked a spot below the forks of the Saskatchewan with the note \\"This is the highest point the French Traders possessed\\". British free trader Thomas Curry, determined to find the extent of the territory explored by the French, ventured from Michilimackinac to Fort Bourbon in 1767 and returned the following spring with four canoes full of the finest pelts. James Finlay followed Curry's example and according to Alexander Mackenzie travelled as far as \\"Nipawee, the last of the French settlements on the bank of the Saskatchiwine river\\". Location hypotheses Saint-Pierre's reference to \\"the Rock mountains\\" and a distance of 300 French leagues up the river from Fort Paskoya (near the modern town of The Pas) led subsequent historians to hypothesize that Niverville's men had travelled as far west as the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, which would have made them the first Europeans to have reached what is now Alberta and to have seen the Canadian Rockies (preceding Henday by three years). Over a century later, taking Saint-Pierre's written account to be accurate, historian Benjamin Sulte wrote that Fort Calgary was situated on the site of the former Fort La Jonqui√®re. NWMP Inspector √âphrem Brisebois alleged that he found the remains of an old fort, which he presumed was La Jonqui√®re, when the detachment arrived there in 1875. On the other hand geologist Joseph Tyrrell speculated in his 1886 report on the natural history of Alberta to Alfred R. C. Selwyn, director of the Geological Survey of Canada, that it was more likely that Niverville's men would have ascended the North Saskwatchewan instead of the south because the Cree that inhabited the territory along the northern branch had been known to the French prior and were on friendly terms, whereas the Blackfoot to the south \\"were always understood to be very fierce and hostile\\". Historian Arthur S. Morton's research concluded that it was \\"... beyond reason that Saint-Pierre should leave Fort La Reine, at Portage la Prairie, on 14th November, with the blizzards of winter ready to break upon the treeless plains, to travel on foot across unknown territory and among tribes till recently bitterly hostile to one another, a distance of some five hundred and fifty miles. Then, too, his narrative shows that in spite of his mention of the Rockies, the fort could not have been so far west.\\" He dismissed the inference that Fort La Jonqui√®re was located near Calgary and attributed the remains Inspector Brisebois found to an American fur-trading fort built in 1833. Instead, Morton believed the fort couldn't have been any further west than the elbow of the South Saskatchewan, and may have been located only 200 yards west of Fort de la Corne, near the Saskatchewan River Forks. In his work on the La V√©rendryes, Fr. Antoine Champagne analyzed Saint-Pierre's writings and given the written accounts of Bougainville, Carleton, Henday, Cocking, Pond, Mackenzie and others that followed made no mention of Fort La Jonqui√®re, like Morton he expressed that it was unlikely Fort La Jonqui√®re was anywhere near the Rockies. Given how inaccurate the distances on scaled maps of the period were, Champagne calculated the fort would have been located only about 100 miles as the crow flies west of Fort Paskoya, about 160 to 180 miles along the river, which would place it near Nipawin.

Career Meechan was born in Plymouth, England and attended St Boniface's Catholic College. He was an Associate Schoolboy at Norwich City in the 1994‚Äì95 season. He moved to Swindon Town in 1997. He was signed by Bristol City in 1998. During this spell he spent time on loan with Yeovil Town, who were in the Football Conference at the time. Meechan was signed by Forest Green Rovers in 2001. he played for the club in the 2001 FA Trophy final at Villa Park. He was signed by Dagenham & Redbridge on a two-year deal in 2003. Dagenham had come within a whisker of promotion to The Football League in the previous two seasons but this spell was not to provide the dream ticket for Meechan, as the Daggers languished in mid-table in the 2003‚Äì04 season. Meechan re-joined Forest Green on a three- month loan in November 2003, after which he was released by the club. Meechan was re-signed by Forest Green Rovers following his release by Dagenham. He was signed by Leigh RMI in 2004. Meechan was signed by Halifax Town in November 2004. After his release by Halifax, Meechan returned for his third spell with Forest Green Rovers in 2005. He was released by Forest Green and joined Chester City on 30 January 2007 until the end of the season. This provided Meechan with a surprise return to Football League circles, although he was to rarely be in the starting line-up. He was moved from striker to the wing, a position he struggled in. He was released in May 2007 after failing to establish himself in the Chester side. Meechan was signed by Conference Premier club York City on 10 July 2007 on a short-term contract.

For its entire history the station has broadcast at 1520 kHz during daytime hours only. The station is known as \\"Joy 1520,\\" and features an Urban Gospel format. History WINW established a solid reputation as a Top 40 station in the 1960s and 1970s, using the slogan \\"WIN-Wonderful.\\" Even as a daytime station with a highly directional 1,000-watt signal, it was successful in Canton for over a decade, sometimes approaching double digits in the ratings, despite its obvious signal limitations. WINW had shared its frequency with WJMP located in nearby Kent, which made the Canton station difficult to hear in Northern Stark County. The station was originally built and run by Joseph Patterson \\"Patt\\" Wardlaw, Jr., who owned Radio KIST 1340 in Santa Barbara, CA, and who had previously owned and operated WLEU in Erie, PA. New AM Top 40 competition in the form of WQIO (Q-10) (now WILB) in late 1976, as well as the increasing popularity of FM radio stations, eventually brought an end to the glory years of \\"WIN-Wonderful.\\" WINW purchased FM station WHLQ (106.9) from Susquehanna Radio Corporation in 1978, changing its call sign to WOOS-FM, and installed an automated Top 40 format there, while WINW changed to a Big Band/Adult Standards format in 1981 and then went through a string of format and call letter changes for the next 15 years. WINW evolved into an adult contemporary station by the mid-1980s, became an automated oldies station in 1987, changed to WRQK (AM) on February 14, 1989 when it was coupled with WRQK-FM, changed back to WINW on August 16, 1989, then changed once again to WPGY on April 5, 1996 (by that time owned by Sabre Communications, who was \\"parking\\" the WPGY call letters for use on its new FM in Elmira, New York), and finally changed back to WINW on March 27, 1997. The 1997 version of WINW was originally a Contemporary Christian station, but leased an increasing amount of its air time to preachers and Urban Gospel music, which eventually became its final format. After many years at its transmitter site on Martindale Road, N.E., WINW moved into new studios at 237 West Tuscarawas Street in downtown Canton not long after the format change to Gospel. The \\"WIN-Wonderful\\" sign from the station's Top 40 heyday remained standing outside the Martindale studio building until the mid-1990s. Off the air On September 23, 2010, WINW's transmitter site was heavily vandalized - the victim of copper theft during the station's off-hours in the nighttime. Due to that and severed tower support cables, WINW was forced off the air for an extended period.http://www.cantonrep.com/news/x802540245/Crime-report-for-Sept-25 Pinebrook Corp. also realized that a 2004 license renewal was dismissed and the station no longer had authority to operate. It returned to the air with a temporary wire antenna, but would eventually fall silent again on February 23, 2011. The FCC deleted WINW's license from their records on March 3, 2011. However, on September 15, 2011, the FCC granted special temporary authority for WINW to resume operations, following a request by Pinebrook Corp., which claimed that repairs to the station's facilities were completed.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=28165 The station returned to the air in December.

It has , and displacement variants, which utilize the names L12A, L13A and L15A. Depending on the region, these engines are sold throughout the world in the 5-door Honda Brio Fit/Jazz hatchback Honda Civic and the 4-door Fit Aria/City sedan (also known as Fit Saloon). They are also sold in the Japanese-only Airwave wagon and Mobilio MPV. Two different valvetrains are present on this engine series. The L12A, L13A and L15A use (), or ‚Äúintelligent Dual & Sequential Ignition‚Äù. i-DSI utilizes two spark plugs per cylinder which fire at different intervals during the combustion process to achieve a more complete burn of the gasoline. This process allows the engine to have more power while keeping fuel consumption low, thanks to the better gasoline utilization. Emissions are also reduced. The i-DSI engines have two to five valves per cylinder and a modest redline of only 6,000 rpm, but reach maximum torque at mid-range rpm, allowing for better performance without having to rev the engine at high speeds. The i-DSI is also known for not using Turbochargers in the performance category, as it uses a high compression, long stroke with a lightweight and compact engine. The other valvetrain in use is the VTEC on one of the two varieties of the L15A. This engine is aimed more at performance than efficiency with a slightly higher redline with 4 valves per cylinder, which reaches peak torque at higher rpm. However, it still offers a good combination of both performance and fuel efficiency. Both the i-DSI and VTEC have relatively high compression ratios at 10.8:1 and 10.4:1, respectively. Before April 2006, the L-series were exclusively available with a 5-speed manual transmission and continuously variable transmission (CVT). With the introduction of the Fit in Canada and the United States, an L-series engine was mated to a traditional automatic transmission with a torque converter for the first time. The L12A i-DSI is available exclusively in the European domestic market Jazz and is sold with only a 5-speed manual transmission.

Life Almost all of what is known about Felton's background comes from the narrative of his daughter, Frances Salisbury. The manuscript that holds her story has a blank where his age should be, but it does say that he was a wealthy man of Norfolk ancestry, who lived at Bermondsey Abbey near Southwark. Bermondsey was a mansion built the generation before on the site of and out of the materials of a great Cluniac monastery.A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 2, Malden, H.E. (ed.), 1967. British History Online. Retrieved on May 14, 2008. He \\"was a man of stature little and of complexion black\\". His wife had been a playmate of Elizabeth I, a maid-of-honour to Queen Mary and the widow of one of Mary's auditors (a legal official of the papal court).Wainewright, John. \\"Blessed John Felton.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 28 May 2013 John Felton was a well-known Catholic, and the father of Thomas Felton. Felton was arrested for fixing a copy of Pope Pius V's Bull Regnans in Excelsis (\\"reigning on high\\"), excommunicating Queen Elizabeth, to the gates of the Bishop of London's palace near St. Paul's. Elizabeth and her ministers were by no means indifferent to the potential political effects of the papal bull. In the Europe of the sixteenth century there were still Catholic powers who might be ready to execute the sentence of deposition that was in those days the corollary of excommunication.Camm O.S.B.,Dom Bede. \\"Blessed John Forest\\". Lives of the English Martyrs Declared Blessed by Pope Leo XIII, Vol. I, p. 2, Longmans, Green and Co., London 1914 Posting the copy of the bull was a significant act of treason as the document, which released Elizabeth's subjects from their allegiance, needed to be promulgated in England before it could take legal effect. The deed brought about the end of the previous policy of tolerance towards those Catholics who were content occasionally to attend their parish church while keeping their true beliefs to themselves. The reaction seemed soon to be justified: it was the publication in England of Pius's exhortation that gave the impetus to the Ridolfi plot, in which the Duke of Norfolk was to kidnap or murder Queen Elizabeth, install Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne and then become king by marrying her. The law records say that the act was committed around eleven at night on 24 May 1570, but Salisbury claims it happened between two and three in the morning of the following day, the Feast of Corpus Christi. Felton had received the bulls in Calais and given one to a friend, William Mellowes of Lincoln's Inn. A general search of known Catholic houses in and near London was undertaken and the copy was soon discovered. After being racked, Mellowes implicated Felton, who was arrested on 26 May. Felton immediately confessed and glorified in his deed, \\"treasonably declar[ing] that the queen ‚Ä¶ ought not to be the queen of England\\",Lock, 2004 but he was still racked as the authorities were seeking, through his testimony, to implicate Guerau de Spes, the Ambassador of Spain, in the action. Felton was condemned on 4 August and executed by hanging four days later in St. Paul's Churchyard, London. He was cut down alive for quartering, and his daughter says that he uttered the holy name of Jesus once or twice when the hangman had his heart in his hand. He was beatified in 1886 by Pope Leo XIII. Records of the trial from Elizabeth's state papers, and the deliberations of the Privy Council regarding the effect on relations with Spain, are retained in the Public Record Office.

He has a degree in Sports Science and Leisure Management from the University of Bedfordshire. His younger brother, Nathan, was also a professional footballer. He also owns a Luton-based company that sell footwear. Playing career Born in Luton to parents from St. Vincent, Abbey began his career with Arlesey Town, before spending a season each at both Baldock Town and Hitchin Town, before joining Cambridge United in February 2000. He soon established himself in the Cambridge side, earning a ¬£350,000 move to Norwich City in December 2000. However his time at Carrow Road was marred by two career threatening knee injuries, causing him to miss most of the 2003‚Äì04 promotion season, though he was given a championship medal at the end of the season. He was given a three-month contract to prove his fitness at the start of the following season. He spent September 2004 on loan at Boston United, playing alongside Paul Gascoigne and scoring once against Chester City. He then moved to Wycombe Wanderers on a free transfer the following month. In November 2004 he moved to Bradford City on a short-term deal. He made his debut for Bradford on 20 November against Brentford when he scored after just two minutes but received the first red card of his career for violent conduct after a clash with Deon Burton. His second game did not come for nearly a month because of suspension and he played a total of only six games before he was released by manager Colin Todd. Abbey joined Stoke City on a month trial in January 2005 playing in the club's reserve side. Despite scoring against Sheffield United Reserves Abbey was not offered a contract.

From 1994 to 2002, the European Union (EU) committed ‚Ç¨130 million. European aid is focusing on technical and financial cooperation projects in the areas of education, health, prison conditions, regional development, environment, and the fight against narcotics. A total of ‚Ç¨63.8 million has been earmarked for Venezuela for the period 2000‚Äì2006 for technical and financial co-operation and rehabilitation and reconstruction. Venezuela currently is not receiving any major foreign aid from the United States. In response to heavy rains, landslides and persistent flooding in the north-central region of Venezuela that began on February 7, 2005, the U.S. Agency for International Development‚Äôs Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 through the U.S. Embassy in Caracas to the Venezuelan Red Cross for the purchase and distribution of emergency relief items.  Aid background  A UNESCO diagram demonstrating the amount Education focused aid provided to Venezuela in 2015 As the wealthiest country in Latin America and an OPEC member, Venezuela has been more frequently a donor than a recipient of foreign assistance. The United States stopped providing aid to Venezuela in the mid-1960s; nor did any bilateral development agency give Venezuela assistance. Instead, Venezuela's bilateral economic relations were characterized by technical cooperation agreements, student exchange programs, or commercial accords similar to those signed by the major industrial nations. Its oil wealth in the 1970s, however, did allow the country to become a major provider of bilateral and multilateral financing. From 1974 to 1981, the nation contributed US$7.3 billion to international development, 64 percent of which went to multilateral sources, such as the United Nations Special Fund, the Andean Reserve Fund, the OPEC Fund, the Coffee Stabilization Fund, the Caribbean Development Bank, and the Central American Bank for Integration, among others. In addition, Caracas was the headquarters of the affiliates or institutes of many regional and international organizations. Total annual contributions in the late 1970s averaged 1.88 percent of GDP, above the 1 percent level suggested by the United Nations for developed countries. Most bilateral assistance, funneled through the FIV, went to Andean nations, Central America, and the Caribbean. Venezuela used this oil wealth to enlarge its profile in regional and international affairs, a prestige it aggressively sought. As its prosperity eroded in the 1980s, Venezuela saw its role as a donor, particularly as a bilateral one, wane. The country's most prominent economic assistance during the decade was dispensed through the joint San Jos√© Accord that it administered along with Mexico in order to provide subsidized oil to the Caribbean Basin region. Throughout the decade, Venezuela remained disposed to intervene in Central America. After supporting the Sandinista National Liberation Front (Frente Sandinista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional‚ÄîFSLN) against the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979, the Venezuelan government also provided financial assistance to the Sandinistas' opposition, the National Opposition Union (Uni√≥n Nacional Oppositora‚ÄîUNO), in its successful bid for power in 1990. Some minimal bilateral funding through the FIV continued in the early 1990s, mainly to promote the country's commercial interests. In the 1980s, however, Venezuela sought funds from the major multilaterals, such as the World Bank and the IMF, after more than a decade of detachment. The World Bank was active in Venezuela from 1961 to 1974, disbursing thirteen loans worth US$340 million. Because of its high per capita income, however, Venezuela did not become eligible for World Bank financing until 1986. In 1989 it received over US$700 million in the form of a structural adjustment loan and a trade reform loan. Venezuela also used its large and previously untapped reserves at the IMF in 1989, when the IMF disbursed the first installment of a threeyear Extended Fund Facility in the amount of US$4.8 billion. These new funds helped ease the country's painful transition to a more open economy, a transition undertaken largely on the advice of the IMF and the World Bank. Another multilateral agency, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), also continued to fund Venezuela's development in highway construction, forestry programs, water and sanitation projects, mining, and other infrastructure projects. In cumulative terms, the IDB provided approximately US$1.3 billion from 1961 to 1990. The economic reforms begun by the P√©rez administration in 1989 tracked with the prevailing liberal orthodoxy of international economics, but flew in the face of traditional Venezuelan state intervention.  During the presidential crisis  = 23 February attempt = During the presidential crisis between the Venezuelan governments of Nicol√°s Maduro and Juan Guaid√≥, a coalition of Colombia, Brazil, the United States and the Netherlands attempted to bring essential goods as a response to shortages in Venezuela. On 23 February, trucks with humanitarian aid attempted to enter Venezuela; the attempts mostly failed. At the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border, the caravans were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets by Venezuelan personnel. The National Guard repressed demonstrations on the Brazilian border and colectivos attacked protesters near the Colombian border, leaving at least four dead, and more than 285 injured. = During coronavirus pandemic = During the COVID-19 pandemic, the first two patients with the novel coronavirus disease were confirmed in Venezuela on 13 March 2020.

After leaving Worksop College, Buckner attended Loughborough University, where he read geography. He later completed an MBA degree. During his first year at university Buckner won the University Athletic Union (UAU) 800m title in 1:51.30. This title would prove to be his only real success during his university years, apart from setting a UK under 23 2000m record of 5:01.90 in 1983. It was when Buckner left university that he was able to concentrate fully on his running and by 1986 his 1500 m personal best had been reduced to 3:35.38. Although by today's standards this time would rank him very highly, in the 1980s standards were far higher, so much so that he was ranked 2 seconds outside the top three performers of Sebastian Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett respectively. Deciding that the 1500m was a difficult event to crack and due to his relative lack of 800m pace, Buckner decided to try his luck at the longer 5000m event. Representing England, the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland, was his first major race and he performed brilliantly finishing with a silver medal in 13:25.87 behind fellow countryman Steve Ovett. Hot on the heels of the Commonwealth Games in 1986 were the European Athletics Championships, which would prove to be a far tougher test. Following a 56-second last lap (see \\"1986 European Championships 5000m,\\" a YouTube video uploaded by tommytempo1), \\"the ill fancied Buckner\\" went on to claim the gold medal in a championship best time of 13:10.15, a record which still stands to this day. Buckner claimed a bronze medal at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics (13:27.74) and in 1988 he finished a brave 6th in the 5.000 metres in Seoul (13:23.85) after an injury ravaged season. This was how it would end for Buckner and despite making an appearance at the 1992 Summer Olympics after he came to within half a second of his best time from 1986, he progressed no further than the heats after a fall. This spelled the end of Buckner's short career as a distance athlete. Shortly after his running career ended, Buckner worked for the sports giant Adidas before he and his family upped sticks and moved to New Zealand to concentrate on apple farming. In his own words this venture was \\"a disaster\\" and when they returned he was appointed project director of the athletics board. Jack's younger brother Tom Buckner was also an international distance runner and gained recognition when he finished 5th at the 1994 Commonwealth Games 3000m steeplechase (8:29.84). Both Tom and Jack have run sub 4 minute miles (Tom 3:58.90 at Portsmouth, UK in 1993) and Jack (3:51.57 at Koblenz, Germany in 1984). Tom and Jack Buckner were the first brothers since the 1950s to compete at the Olympics (in the 1992 Barcelona Olympic games).

It is a product consumers create to disseminate online product or the firm that markets it. User-generated content is used for a wide range of applications, including problem processing, news, entertainment, advertising, gossip and research. It is an example of the democratization of content production and the flattening of traditional media hierarchies. The BBC adopted a user- generated content platform for its websites in 2005, and TIME Magazine named \\"You\\" as the Person of the Year in 2006, referring to the rise in the production of UGC on Web 2.0 platforms. CNN also developed a similar user- generated content platform, known as iReport.iReport There are other examples of news channels implementing similar protocols, especially in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophe or terrorist attack. Social media users are able to provide key eyewitness content and information that may otherwise have been inaccessible. Due to new media and technology affordances, such as low cost and low barriers to entry, the Internet is an easy platform to create and dispense user-generated content, allowing the dissemination of information at a rapid pace in the wake of an event. Definition The advent of user- generated content marked a shift among media organizations from creating online content to providing facilities for amateurs to publish their own content. User-generated content has also been characterized as citizen media as opposed to the 'packaged goods media' of the past century. Citizen Media is audience-generated feedback and news coverage. People give their reviews and share stories in the form of user-generated and user-uploaded audio and user- generated video. The former is a two-way process in contrast to the one-way distribution of the latter. Conversational or two-way media is a key characteristic of so-called Web 2.0 which encourages the publishing of one's own content and commenting on other people's content. The role of the passive audience therefore has shifted since the birth of New Media, and an ever- growing number of participatory users are taking advantage of the interactive opportunities, especially on the Internet to create independent content. Grassroots experimentation then generated an innovation in sounds, artists, techniques and associations with audiences which then are being used in mainstream media.Jenkins, Henry (SODA), \\"Convergence Culture\\", New York University Press, New York The active, participatory and creative audience is prevailing today with relatively accessible media, tools and applications, and its culture is in turn affecting mass media corporations and global audiences. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has defined three central schools for UGC: # Publication requirement: While UGC could be made by a user and never published online or elsewhere, we focus here on the work that is published in some context, be it on a publicly accessible website or on a page on a social networking site only accessible to a select group of people (e.g., fellow university students). This is a useful way to exclude email, two-way instant messages and the like. # Creative effort: Creative effort was put into creating the work or adapting existing works to construct a new one; i.e. users must add their own value to the work. UGC often also has a collaborative element to it, as is the case with websites which users can edit collaboratively. For example, merely copying a portion of a television show and posting it to an online video website (an activity frequently seen on the UGC sites) would not be considered UGC. If a user uploads his/her photographs, however, expresses his/her thoughts in a blog, or creates a new music video, this could be considered UGC. Yet the minimum amount of creative effort is hard to define and depends on the context. # Creation outside of professional routines and practices: User-generated content is generally created outside of professional routines and practices. It often does not have an institutional or a commercial market context. In extreme cases, UGC may be produced by non-professionals without the expectation of profit or remuneration. Motivating factors include connecting with peers, achieving a certain level of fame, notoriety, or prestige, and the desire to express oneself. It is important to have an objective before attempting to become part of the UGC/social networking environment. For example, companies may ask users to post their reviews directly to their Facebook page. This could end up disastrous if a user makes a comment that steers people away from the product. Mere copy & paste or hyperlinking could also be seen as user-generated self- expression. The action of linking to a work or copying a work could in itself motivate the creator, express the taste of the person linking or copying. Digg.com, StumbleUpon.com, and leaptag.com are good examples of where such linkage to work happens. The culmination of such linkages could very well identify the tastes of a person in the community and make that person unique. User-generated content occurs when a product's customers create and disseminate online ideas about a product or the firm that markets it. These ideas are often in the form of text but also come in other forms such as music, photos, or videos. UGC has three key characteristics: (1) The contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm that sells this product; (2) it is creative in nature and the user adds something new; (3) it is posted online and generally accessible.  Media pluralism  According to Cisco Systems, in 2016 an average of 96,000 petabytes was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.Cisco Systems. 201. The Zettabyte Era: Trends and Analysis. In 2016, the number of active websites surpassed 1 billion, up from approximately 700 million in 2012.Internet Live Stats. 2017. Total number of websites. This means the content we currently have access to is more diverse than ever before. Reaching 1.66 billion daily active users in Q4 2019, Facebook has emerged as the most popular social media platform globally.TechCrunch. 2020. Facebook hits 2.5B users in Q4 but shares sink from slow profits. TechCrunch. Available at https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/facebook-earnings-q4-2019/. Accessed 18 February 2020. Other social media platforms are also dominant at the regional level such as: Twitter in Japan, Naver in the Republic of Korea, Instagram (owned by Facebook) and LinkedIn (owned by Microsoft) in Africa, VKontakte (VK) and Odnoklassniki in Russia and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, WeChat and QQ in China. However, a concentration phenomenon is occurring globally giving the dominance to a few online platforms that become popular for some unique features they provide, most commonly for the added privacy they offer users through disappearing messages or end-to-end encryption (e.g. WhatsApp, Snapchat, Signal, and Telegram), but they have tended to occupy niches and to facilitate the exchanges of information that remain rather invisible to larger audiences. Production of freely accessible information has been increasing since 2012. In January 2017, Wikipedia had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012. This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English. In 2017, less than 12 percent of Wikipedia content was in English, down from 18 percent in 2012.Wikimedia Foundation. 2017. Wikipedia Statistics. Available at https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm. Graham, Straumann, and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge. For example, while content on Africa has dramatically increased, a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe, rather than from Africa itself. History The massive, multi-volume Oxford English Dictionary was exclusively composed of user-generated content. In 1857, Richard Chenevix Trench of the London Philological Society sought public contributions from throughout the English-speaking world for the creation of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. As Simon Winchester recounts: > So what we're going to do, if I have your agreement that we're going to > produce such a dictionary, is that we're going to send out invitations, were > going to send these invitations to every library, every school, every > university, every book shop that we can identify throughout the English- > speaking world... everywhere where English is spoken or read with any degree > of enthusiasm, people will be invited to contribute words. And the point is, > the way they do it, the way they will be asked and instructed to do it, is > to read voraciously and whenever they see a word, whether it's a preposition > or a sesquipedalian monster, they are to... if it interests them and if > where they read it, they see it in a sentence that illustrates the way that > that word is used, offers the meaning of the day to that word, then they are > to write it on a slip of paper... the top left-hand side you write the word, > the chosen word, the catch word, which in this case is 'twilight'. Then the > quotation, the quotation illustrates the meaning of the word. And underneath > it, the citation, were it came from, whether it was printed or whether it > was in manuscript... and then the reference, the volume, the page and so > on... and send these slips of paper, these slips are the key to the making > of this dictionary, in to the headquarters of the dictionary. In the following decades, hundreds of thousands of contributions were sent to the editors. In the 1990s several electronic bulletin board systems were based on user-generated content. Some of these systems have been converted into websites, including the film information site IMDb which started as rec.arts.movies in 1990. With the growth of the World Wide Web the focus moved to websites, several of which were based on user-generated content, including Wikipedia (2001) and Flickr (2004). User-generated Internet video was popularized by YouTube, an online video platform founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim and Steve Chen in April 2005. It enabled the video streaming of MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) user-generated content from anywhere on the World Wide Web. The BBC set up a pilot user-generated content team in April 2005 with 3 staff. In the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings and the Buncefield oil depot fire, the team was made permanent and was expanded, reflecting the arrival in the mainstream of the citizen journalist. After the Buncefield disaster the BBC received over 5,000 photos from viewers. The BBC does not normally pay for content generated by its viewers. In 2006 CNN launched CNN iReport, a project designed to bring user-generated news content to CNN. Its rival Fox News Channel launched its project to bring in user-generated news, similarly titled \\"uReport\\". This was typical of major television news organisations in 2005‚Äì2006, who realised, particularly in the wake of the London 7 July bombings, that citizen journalism could now become a significant part of broadcast news. Sky News, for example, regularly solicits for photographs and video from its viewers. User-generated content was featured in Time magazine's 2006 Person of the Year, in which the person of the year was \\"you\\", meaning all of the people who contribute to user-generated media, including YouTube, Wikipedia and MySpace. A precursor to user-generated content uploaded on YouTube was America's Funniest Home Videos. Motivation for creating UGC The benefits derived from user-generated content for the content host are clear, these include low cost promotion, positively impact on product sales and fresh content. However the benefit to the contributor is less direct. There are various theories behind the motivation for contributing user- generated content, ranging from altruistic, to social, to materialistic. Due to the high value of user-generated content, many sites use incentives to encourage their generation. These incentives can be generally categorized into implicit incentives and explicit incentives.Toluna: # Implicit incentives: These incentives are not based on anything tangible. Social incentives are the most common form of implicit incentives. These incentives allow the user to feel good as an active member of the community. These can include the relationship between users, such as Facebook's friends, or Twitter's followers. Social incentives also include the ability to connect users with others, as seen on the sites already mentioned as well as sites like YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter, which allow users to share media from their lives with others. Users also share the experiences that they have while using a particular product/service. This will improve the customer experience as they can make informed decisions in buying a product, which makes them smart buyers. Other common social incentives are status, badges, or levels within the site, something a user earns when they reach a certain level of participation which may or may not come with additional privileges. Yahoo! Answers is an example of this type of social incentive. Another social incentive is social comparison. Being aware of the user's own ranking or level among the whole community could affect the behavior as well. Social incentives cost the host site very little and can catalyze vital growth; however, their very nature requires a sizable existing community before it can function. Social incentive can also be split into identification and integration. The identification motivation has strong external standardization and internalization of behavioral goals, such as social identity, that is, users will follow some subjective norms and images to constrain and practice their behaviors. The integration has the strongest external standardization and goal internalization, and the agent often integrates its actual actions with the subjective norms of the environment, so it has the effect of self-restraint and self-realization, such as the sense of belonging. Naver Knowledge-iN is another example of this type of social incentive. It uses a point system to encourage users to answer more questions by receiving points. # Explicit incentives: These incentives refer to tangible rewards. Explicit incentives can be split into externality and projection. External motivation is more inclined to economic and material incentives, such as the reward for engaging in a task, which has little internalization and lacks relevant external norms and constraints. Examples include financial payment, entry into a contest, a voucher, a coupon, or frequent traveler miles. Direct explicit incentives are easily understandable by most and have immediate value regardless of the community size; sites such as the Canadian shopping platform Wishabi and Amazon Mechanical Turk both use this type of financial incentive in slightly different ways to encourage user participation. The projective agent has some external norms, but the degree of internalization is not enough, that is, it has not been fully recognized by the actor. The drawback to explicit incentives is that they may cause the user to be subject to the over justification effect, eventually believing the only reason for the participating is for the explicit incentive. This reduces the influence of the other form of social or altruistic motivation, making it increasingly costly for the content host to retain long-term contributors.HOPLA Online: Ranking and assessment The distribution of UGC across the Web provides a high volume data source that is accessible for analysis, and offers utility in enhancing the experiences of end users. Social science research can benefit from having access to the opinions of a population of users, and use this data to make inferences about their traits. Applications in information technology seek to mine end user data to support and improve machine-based processes, such as information retrieval and recommendation. However, processing the high volumes of data offered by UGC necessitate the ability to automatically sort and filter these data points according to their value. Determining the value of user contributions for assessment and ranking can be difficult due to the variation in the quality and structure of this data. The quality and structure of the data provided by UGC is application-dependent, and can include items such as tags, reviews, or comments that may or may not be accompanied by useful metadata. Additionally, the value of this data depends on the specific task for which it will be utilized and the available features of the application domain. Value can ultimately be defined and assessed according to whether the application will provide service to a crowd of humans, a single end user, or a platform designer. The variation of data and specificity of value has resulted in various approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC. The performance of each method essentially depends on the features and metrics that are available for analysis. Consequently, it is critical to have an understanding of the task objective and its relation to how the data is collected, structured, and represented in order to choose the most appropriate approach to utilizing it. The methods of assessment and ranking can be categorized into two classes: human-centered and machine-centered. Methods emphasizing human-centered utility consider the ranking and assessment problem in terms of the users and their interactions with the system, whereas the machine-centered method considers the problem in terms of machine learning and computation. The various methods of assessment and ranking can be classified into one of four approaches: community-based, user-based, designer-based, and hybrid. * Community-based approaches rely on establishing ground truth based on the wisdom of the crowd regarding the content of interest. The assessments provided by the community of end users is utilized to directly rank content within the system in human-centered methods. The machine-centered method applies these community judgments in training algorithms to automatically assess and rank UGC. * User-based approaches emphasize the differences between individual users so that ranking and assessment can interactively adapt or be personalized given the particular requirements of each user. The human- centered approach accentuates interactive interfaces where the user can define and redefine their preferences as their interests shift. On the other hand, machine-centered approaches model the individual user according to explicit and implicit knowledge that is gathered through system interactions. * Designer-based approaches primarily use machine-centered methods to essentially maximize the diversity of content presented to users in order to avoid constraining the space of topic selections or perspectives. The diversity of content can be assessed with respect to various dimensions, such as authorship, topics, sentiments, and named entities. * Hybrid approaches seek to combine methods from the various frameworks in order to develop a more robust approach for assessing and ranking UGC. Approaches are most often combined in one of two ways: the crowd-based approach is often used to identify hyperlocal content for a user-based approach, or a user-based approach is used to maintain the intent of a designer-based approach. ;Key concepts: # contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm # creative in nature and adds something new # posted online and generally accessible. Types There are many types of user-generated content: Internet forums, where people talk about different topics; blogs are services where users can post about many topics, product reviews on a supplier website or in social media; wikis such as Wikipedia and Wikia allow users, sometimes including anonymous users, to edit the content. Another type of user-generated content are social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter,Snapchat, TikTok or VK, where users interact with other people via chatting, writing messages, posting images or links, and sharing content. Media hosting sites such as YouTube allow users to post content. Some forms of user-generated content, such as a social commentary blog, can be considered as a form of citizen journalism. = Blogs = Blogs are websites created by individuals, groups, and associations. They mostly consist of journal-style text and enable interaction between a blogger and reader in the form of online comments. Self-hosted blogs can be created by professional entities such as entrepreneurs and small businesses. Blog hosting platforms include WordPress, Blogger, and Medium; Typepad is often used by media companies; Weebly is geared for online shopping. Social networking blogging platforms include Tumblr, LiveJournal, and Sina Weibo. Among the many blogs on the web, Boing Boing is a group blog with themes including technology and science fiction; HuffPost blogs include opinions on subjects such as politics, entertainment, and technology. There are also travel blogs such as Head for Points, Adventurous Kate, and an early form of The Points Guy. = Websites = Entertainment social media and information sharing websites include Reddit, 9Gag, 4chan, Upworthy, Newgrounds, Inbound.org, and Distractify. Sites like 9Gag allow users to create memes and quick video clips. Sites like Tech in Asia and Buzzfeed engage readers with professional communities by posting articles with user-generated comment sections. Other websites include fanfiction sites such as FanFiction.Net; imageboards; artwork communities like DeviantArt; mobile photos and video sharing sites such as Picasa and Flickr; audio social networks such as SoundCloud; crowd funding or crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and ArtistShare; and customer review sites such as Yelp. The travel industry, in particular, has begun utilizing user- generated content to show authentic traveler experiences. Travel-related companies such as The Millennial, Gen Z, and Busabout relaunched their websites featuring UGC images and social content by their customers posted in real time. TripAdvisor includes reviews and recommendations by travelers about hotels, restaurants, and activities. The restaurant industry has also been altered by a review system the places more emphasis on online reviews and content from peers than traditional media reviews. In 2011 Yelp contained 70% of reviews for restaurants in the Seattle area compared to Food & Wine Magazine containing less than 5 percent. =Video games= Video games can have fan-made content in the form of mods, fan patches, fan translations or server emulators.You're in charge! - From vital patches to game cancellations, players are often intimately involved. by Christian Donlan on Eurogamer \\"Supreme Commander fans released Forged Alliance Forever and gave the game the online client it could otherwise only dream of. I haven't played it much, but I still got a tear in my eye when I read about the extents these coders had gone to. There's nothing quite so wonderful to witness as love, and this is surely love of the very purest order. [...] SupCom guys resurrect a series whose publisher had just gone under.\\" (2013-11-02) Some games come with level editor programs to aid in their creation. A few massively multiplayer online games including Star Trek Online, Dota 2, and EverQuest 2 have UGC systems integrated into the game itself. A metaverse can be a user-generated world, such as Second Life. =Advertising= A popular use of UGC involves collaboration between a brand and a user. An example is the \\"Elf Yourself\\" videos by Jib Jab that come back every year around Christmas. The Jib Jab website lets people use their photos of friends and family that they have uploaded to make a holiday video to share across the internet. You cut and paste the faces of the people in the pictures to animated dancing elves. Some brands are also using UGC images to boost the performance of their paid social ads. For example, Toyota leveraged UGC for their \\"Feeling the Streets\\" Facebook ad campaign and were able to increase their total ad engagement by 440%. =Retailers= Some bargain hunting websites feature user-generated content, such as eBay, Dealsplus, and FatWallet which allow users to post, discuss, and control which bargains get promoted within the community. Because of the dependency of social interaction, these sites fall into the category of social commerce. =Educational= Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia, is one of the largest user-generated content databases in the world. Platforms such as YouTube have frequently been used as an instructional aide. Organizations such as the Khan Academy and the Green brothers have used the platform to upload series of videos on topics such as math, science, and history to help aid viewers master or better understand the basics. Educational podcasts have also helped in teaching through an audio platform. Personal websites and messaging systems like Yahoo Messenger have also been used to transmit user-generated educational content. There have also been web forums where users give advice to each other. Students can also manipulate digital images or video clips to their advantage and tag them with easy to find keywords then share them to friends and family worldwide. The category of \\"student performance content\\" has risen in the form of discussion boards and chat logs. Students could write reflective journals and diaries that may help others. The websites SparkNotes and Shmoop are used to summarize and analyze books so that they are more accessible to the reader. =Photo sharing= Photo sharing websites are another popular form of UGC. Flickr is a site in which users are able to upload personal photos they have taken and label them in regards to their \\"motivation\\". Flickr not only hosts images but makes them publicly available for reuse and reuse with modification. Instagram is a social media platform that allows users to edit, upload and include location information with photos they post. = Video sharing = Video sharing websites are another popular form of UGC. YouTube allows users to create and upload videos. Effect on journalism The incorporation of user-generated content into mainstream journalism outlets is considered to have begun in 2005 with the BBC's creation of a user-generated content team, which was expanded and made permanent in the wake of the July 7, 2005 London bombings. The incorporation of Web 2.0 technologies into news websites allowed user-generated content online to move from more social platforms such as MySpace, LiveJournal, and personal blogs, into the mainstream of online journalism, in the form of comments on news articles written by professional journalists, but also through surveys, content sharing, and other forms of citizen journalism. Since the mid-2000s, journalists and publishers have had to consider the effects that user- generated content has had on how news gets published, read, and shared. A 2016 study on publisher business models suggests that readers of online news sources value articles written both by professional journalists, as well as users‚Äîprovided that those users are experts in a field relevant to the content that they create. In response to this, it is suggested that online news sites must consider themselves not only a source for articles and other types of journalism, but also a platform for engagement and feedback from their communities. The ongoing engagement with a news site that is possible due to the interactive nature of user-generated content is considered a source of sustainable revenue for publishers of online journalism going forward. Journalists are increasingly sourcing UGC from platforms, such as Facebook and TikTok, as news shifts to a digital space. This form of crowdsourcing can include using user content to support claims, using social media platforms to contact witnesses and obtain relevant images and videos for articles. Use in marketing The use of user-generated content has been prominent in the efforts of marketing online, especially among millennials. A good reason for this may be that 86% of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands they support, and 60% believe user-generated content is not only the most authentic form of content, but also the most influential when making purchasing decisions. An increasing number of companies have been employing UGC techniques into their marketing efforts, such as Starbucks with their \\"White Cup Contest\\" campaign where customers competed to create the best doodle on their cups and GoPro as they encourage their UGC strategy by hosting their popular Million Dollar Challenge where users contribute video contents for an opportunity to win a share of the million dollar prize. The effectiveness of UGC in marketing has been shown to be significant as well. For instance, the \\"Share a Coke\\" by Coca-Cola campaign in which customers uploaded images of themselves with bottles to social media attributed to a two percent increase in revenue. Of millennials, UGC can influence purchase decisions up to fifty-nine percent of the time, and eighty-four percent say that UGC on company websites has at least some influence on what they buy, typically in a positive way. As a whole, consumers place peer recommendations and reviews above those of professionals. User-generated content used in a marketing context has been known to help brands in numerous ways. * It encourages more engagement with its users, and doubles the likeliness that the content will be shared. * It builds trust with consumers. With a majority of consumers trusting UGC over brand provided information,\\"a person like me\\" as their most trusted source: UGC can allow for better brand-consumer relationships. * It provides SEO Value for brands. This in turn means more traffic is driven to the brands websites and that more content is linked back to the website. * It reassures purchase decisions which will keep customers shopping. With UGC, the conversion rate increases by as much as 4.6%. * It increases follower count on various social media platforms. * It helps integration with traditional marketing/promotional techniques which in turn drives more conversions for the companies. * It helps in increasing profit with significant reduction in costs for the company. * It typically low cost promotion since content given by free for firm's customers. Opportunities There are many opportunities in user-generated content. The advantage of UGC is that it is a quick, easy way to reach the masses. Here are some examples: * The companies could use social media for branding, and set up contests for the audience to submit their own creations. * The consumers and general audience members like to engage. Some have used a storytelling platform to both share and converse with others. * To raise awareness, whether it be for an organization, company, or event. * Gain perspectives from members that one wouldn't otherwise get to engage with. * Personalization of the content put out; 71% of consumers like personalized ads. * Encouraging participation can be weakened by company claims to owning this content. Criticism The term \\"user-generated content\\" has received some criticism. The criticism to date has addressed issues of fairness, quality, privacy, the sustainable availability of creative work and effort among legal issues namely related to intellectual property rights such as copyrights etc. Some commentators assert that the term \\"user\\" implies an illusory or unproductive distinction between different kinds of \\"publishers\\", with the term \\"users\\" exclusively used to characterize publishers who operate on a much smaller scale than traditional mass-media outlets or who operate for free. Such classification is said to perpetuate an unfair distinction that some argue is diminishing because of the prevalence and affordability of the means of production and publication. A better response might be to offer optional expressions that better capture the spirit and nature of such work, such as EGC, Entrepreneurial Generated Content (see external reference below). Sometimes creative works made by individuals are lost because there are limited or no ways to precisely preserve creations when a UGC Web site service closes down. One example of such loss is the closing of the Disney massively multiplayer online game \\"VMK\\". VMK, like most games, has items that are traded from user to user. Many of these items are rare within the game. Users are able to use these items to create their own rooms, avatars and pin lanyard. This site shut down at 10 pm CDT on 21 May 2008. There are ways to preserve the essence, if not the entirety of such work through the users copying text and media to applications on their personal computers or recording live action or animated scenes using screen capture software, and then uploading elsewhere. Long before the Web, creative works were simply lost or went out of publication and disappeared from history unless individuals found ways to keep them in personal collections. Another criticized aspect is the vast array of user-generated product and service reviews that can at times be misleading for consumer on the web. A study conducted at Cornell University found that an estimated 1 to 6 percent of positive user-generated online hotel reviews are fake. Another concern of platforms that rely heavily on user-generated content, such as Twitter and Facebook, is how easy it is to find people who holds the same opinions and interests in addition to how well they facilitate the creation of networks or closed groups. While the strength of these services are that users can broaden their horizon by sharing their knowledge and connect with other people from around the world, these platforms also make it very easy to connect with only a restricted sample of people who holds similar opinions (see Filter bubble). There is also criticism regarding whether or not those who contribute to a platform should be paid for their content. In 2015, A group of 18 famous content creators on Vine attempted to negotiate a deal with Vine representatives to secure a $1.2 million contract for a guaranteed 12 videos a month. This negotiation was not successful. Legal problems The ability for services to accept user-generated content opens up a number of legal concerns, from the broader sense to specific local laws. In general, knowing who committed the online crime is difficult because many use pseudonyms or remain anonymous. Sometimes it can be traced back. But in the case of a public coffee shop, they have no way of pinpointing the exact user. There is also a problem with the issues surrounding extremely harmful but not legal acts. For example, the posting of content that instigates a person's suicide. It is a criminal offense if there is proof of \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\" but different situations may produce different outcomes. Depending on the country, there is certain laws that come with the Web 2.0. In the United States, the \\"Section 230\\" exemptions of the Communications Decency Act state that \\"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\\" This clause effectively provides a general immunity for websites that host user-generated content that is defamatory, deceptive or otherwise harmful, even if the operator knows that the third-party content is harmful and refuses to take it down. An exception to this general rule may exist if a website promises to take down the content and then fails to do so. =Copyright laws= Copyright laws also play a factor in relation to user-generated content, as users may use such services to upload works‚Äîparticularly videos‚Äîthat they do not have the sufficient rights to distribute. In many cases, the use of these materials may be covered by local \\"fair use\\" laws, especially if the use of the material submitted is transformative. Local laws also vary on who is liable for any resulting copyright infringements caused by user-generated content; in the United States, the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA)‚Äîa portion of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), dictates safe harbor provisions for \\"online service providers\\" as defined under the act, which grants immunity from secondary liability for the copyright-infringing actions of their users, as long as they promptly remove access to allegedly infringing materials upon the receipt of a notice from a copyright holder or registered agent, and they do not have actual knowledge that their service is being used for infringing activities. In the UK, the Defamation Act of 1996 says that if a person is not the author, editor or publisher and did not know about the situation, they are not convicted. Furthermore, ISPs are not considered authors, editors, or publishers and they cannot have responsibility for people they have no \\"effective control\\" over. Just like the DMCA, once the ISP learns about the content, they must delete it immediately. The European Union's approach is horizontal by nature, which means that civil and criminal liability issues are addressed under the Electronic Commerce Directive. Section 4 deals with liability of the ISP while conducting \\"mere conduit\\" services, caching and web hosting services. Research A study on YouTube analyzing one of the Video On Demand systems was conducted in 2007. The length of the video had decreased by two-fold from the non-UGC content but they saw a fast production rate. The user behavior is what perpetuates the UGC. The act of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) was studied and saw a great benefit to the system. They also studied the impact of content aliasing, sharing of multiple copies, and illegal uploads.Cha Meeyoung et al. \\"I tube, you tube, we tube, everybody tubes: analyzing the world's largest user generated content video system.\\" Internet Measurement Conference (2007). A study from York University in Ontario in 2012 conducted research that resulted in a proposed framework for comparing brand-related UGC and to understand how the strategy used by a company could influence the brand sentiment across different social media channels including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. The three scholars of this study examined two clothing brands, Lulu Lemon and American Apparel. The difference between these two brands is that Lulu Lemon had a social media following while American Apparel was the complete opposite with no social media following. Unsurprisingly, Lulu Lemon had much more positive contributions compared to American Apparel which had less positive contributions. Lulu Lemon has three times the number of positive contributions, 64 percent vs 22 percent for American Apparel on Twitter while on Facebook and YouTube, they had roughly an equal number of contributions. This proves that social media can influence how a brand is perceived, usually in a more positive light. A study by Dhar and Chang, published in 2007, found that the volume of blogs posted on a music album was positively correlated with future sales of that album.

It is a right tributary of the Main. Its source is in the Spessart hills at Sterbfritz, near Schl√ºchtern. The Kinzig flows into the Main in Hanau. The Main-Kinzig-Kreis (district) was named after the river. The towns along the Kinzig are Schl√ºchtern, Steinau an der Stra√üe, Bad Soden-Salm√ºnster, Gelnhausen, and Hanau. The Kinzig is first recorded in 815 A.D. as Chinzicha. This river played a part in the Battle of Hanau in October 1813, as Napoleon retreated back to the Rhine, after his defeat at the Battle of Leipzig.  Geography  = Sources = The source of the Kinzig in Sterbfritz The source of the Kinzig (Kinzigquelle) is located at a height of about , in the vicinity of an Aussiedlerhof, a recently established farmstead outside a village, south of Sterbfritz in the municipality of Sinntal. It is a small spring, enclosed in sandstone, that has an outflow pipe. The headstream that rises here flows for a few metres towards the northwest where it unites with a longer headstream. = Course = The river and its main tributaries From its source, the Kinzig runs northwest and forms the boundary between the Hessian Rh√∂n Nature Park and the Hessian Spessart Nature Park as far as Schl√ºchtern. West of Schl√ºchtern the Kinzig flows in a southwesterly direction and separates the Vogelsberg hills to the north from the Spessart to the south. Between Steinau and Ahl is the Kinzig Dam. In its lower reaches the Kinzig is used by canoeists. Shortly before Hanau the Kinzig flows through the so-called Bulau. This woodland area was formerly used by the US Army as an exercise area and is therefore still very natural. During high water, water flows rapidly through many ditches in the water meadows so that, in spring, extensive bear garlic meadows appear. After about 82 kilometres, the river empties into the Main in Hanau at a height of about . Here, there are balcony-like views of the castle of Philippsruhe or the Main river port.

It was the first album released after Reed had left Arista Records and returned to RCA Records. The album was released around Reed's 40th birthday, and covers topics of marriage and settling down, alongside themes of violence, paranoia, and alcoholism. Production and recording Reed and Robert Quine's guitars were mixed separately in the right and left stereo channels respectively. To differentiate his guitar's sound from Reed's, Quine used D tuning, playing each song as if it was one major second higher. For example, \\"Heavenly Arms\\" is in G major, so Quine used fingerings for A major to play the song. Quine, who years earlier followed the Velvet Underground across the country and taped several of their early shows (they were later released as Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes), made for a suitable complement to Reed. Quine also toured in support of the album and can be seen on the recorded The Bottom Line show titled A Night with Lou Reed. Quine later described the album as, \\"a record that I'm particularly proud of. We had never played together before going into the studio. There were no rehearsals and most of it was done in one or two takes. I like all the things that I've done with Lou but that will always be special for me.\\" Quine and Reed share the distinction of being named to Rolling Stone's Top 100 Guitarists of All-Time List. Fernando Saunders, who subsequently became a longtime Reed collaborator, plays the bass and adds backing vocals (most noticeably, a falsetto refrain in the outro to \\"Heavenly Arms\\") to this album and can also be seen in A Night with Lou Reed. Saunders later said, \\"it was like a dream come true. Lou wanted me to play the things no one would ever let me play, the things I would sit in my bedroom and play. Suddenly I was glad I hadn't quit music for my uncle's insurance company.\\" The album contains no instrumental overdubs with the exception of Reed's guitar on \\"My House\\", but all vocals were overdubbed with the exception of \\"The Heroine\\". The drummer for the album was studio musician Doane Perry, who later joined Jethro Tull. The album cover was designed by Reed's then wife, Sylvia, and features a blue version of a photograph by Mick Rock from the cover art of 1972's Transformer. In 2000, a remastered version of The Blue Mask was released. Critical reception In 2010, Jess Harvell off Pitchfork wrote: \\"1982's The Blue Mask, featuring guitarist Robert Quine's virtuoso blend of post-Reed skronk and speed-folkie melodicism, is still the one to slot alongside Transformer and Street Hassle. The album realigned Reed with the punk and new/no wave movements he helped sire, and it was helped into the canon by Reed's strongest (and most heart-wrenching) batch of songs in years.\\" NME said, \\"What made The Blue Mask Lou Reed‚Äôs watershed album was his choice of musicians, a new wave super-set of them ‚Äì Fernando Saunders on bass, Doane Perry on drums, and the legendary Robert Quine on guitar.

He is commonly viewed as one of the greatest generals since Jin's loss of northern China, as he led the campaign that destroyed Cheng Han and annexed its lands to Jin, and had some successes against the northern states Former Qin and Former Yan (although both campaigns ultimately ended in failure, perhaps due to his overcautiousness). After his death, the Huan clan would be entrenched in the Jin power struction for decades, after his son Huan Xuan temporarily usurped the Jin throne in 403 as the emperor of Chu (Ê•ö), he was posthumously honored as Emperor Xuanwu of Chu with the temple name of Taizu (Â§™Á•ñ).  Early life and career  Huan Wen was born in 313. His father Huan Yi (Ê°ìÂΩù) was a commandery governor. When he was young, his father once received a visit from Wen Jiao, who saw the boy and thought that the child was special. Huan Yi, because Wen had a high opinion of the child, thus named his son Wen, after Wen Jiao's family name. In 328, during the rebellion of Su Jun, Huan Yi tried to resist Su's forces, but was defeated and killed by Su's general Han Huang, who received help from Huan Yi's subordinate Jiang Bo (Ê±üÊí≠). In 330, after Jiang had already died, Huan Wen killed Jiang's sons to avenge his father, and this was an act that brought him great fame. As he was considered capable, and his father had died for the imperial cause, he was selected as the husband for Emperor Cheng's sister Sima Xingnan (Âè∏È¶¨ËààÁî∑) the Princess Nankang. He inherited his father's title of the Baron of Wanning, and he gradually rose in rank, eventually becoming the governor of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, then modern central Jiangsu). Emperor Cheng's uncle Yu Yi (Â∫æÁøº) was impressed with his talent, and often endorsed him for even greater responsibilities. During Emperor Kang's brief reign, Huan was one of the few officials who supported Yu's plan for a northern campaign against Later Zhao in 343, although Yu's plan was never actually carried out. After Yu's death in 345 (during the reign of Emperor Mu, then a toddler), the prime minister He Chong (‰ΩïÂÖÖ) commissioned Huan to succeed Yu, as the commander of the military forces in the western provinces (roughly modern Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan), even though some other imperial officials had misgivings about Huan's ambitions and independence.  Campaign against Cheng Han  Soon after taking over for Yu, the ambitious Huan turned his attention west, wanting to destroy Cheng Han, whose emperor Li Shi had mismanaged his state and lost the trust of his people. Most generals had concerns about the geographic barriers that isolated Cheng Han (which occupied modern Sichuan and Chongqing) from Jin, and that Later Zhao might make a surprise attack if it realized that Jin's forces were attacking Cheng Han. Late in 346, he launched the campaign. Li Shi sent his uncle Li Fu (ÊùéÁ¶è), cousin Li Quan (ÊùéÊ¨ä), and Zan Jian (ÊòùÂ†Ö) to lead his forces to resist Huan, but Huan defeated Li Fu and then, abandoning most of his supplies and traveling light, quickly arrived in the vicinity of Cheng Han's capital Chengdu. Zan Jian's forces, in fear, collapsed, instead of being able to regroup to try to save Chengdu. However, Li Shi gathered the remaining troops and mounted a counterattack that was initially successful. Huan, in fear, ordered retreat‚Äîbut his signal officer, in panic, beat his drums (signifying attack) rather than his gong (signifying retreat). The Jin forces attacked harder and defeated Cheng Han forces, allowing Huan to march upon Chengdu's gates. Li Shi fled, but soon had a messenger submit a humble surrender petition to Huan. He then surrendered in person after binding himself and bringing a coffin‚Äîsignifying readiness to be executed. Huan released him and escorted him to the Jin capital Jiankang, where Emperor Mu pardoned him and created him a marquess. To reward Huan, Emperor Mu created him the Duke of Linhe.  Mutual suspicion with imperial officials  The victory over Cheng Han, however, brought fear in imperial officials that the ambitious Huan intended to control the government. Emperor Mu's granduncle Sima Yu, Prince of Kuaiji, in order to counter Huan, invited a renowned official, Yin Hao, to join in major decision- making with him and Cai Mo. This brought a rivalry that Huan and Yin had since their youth (when both were viewed as up-and-coming talent) into the open. The rivalry intensified after Yin seized more power late in 350 after accusing Cai of being disrespectful to the emperor (by repeatedly declining an honor that was being bestowed on him) and demoting Cai to commoner status. Over the next few years, as Later Zhao collapsed in the midst of internecine wars between the emperor Shi Hu's sons and adoptive grandson Shi Min after Shi Hu's death in 349, Huan repeatedly requested the imperial government to authorize him to advance north to try to recover northern China for Jin, but he was repeatedly rebuffed, even after a campaign by Emperor Mu's maternal grandfather Chu Pou (Ë§öË£í) ended badly. Around the new year 352, Huan, upset that his requests were being repeatedly denied, mobilized his troops and gestured as if he were about to attack the capital. Yin was shocked, and initially considered either resigning or send the imperial banner of peace (Zouyu Fan, È®∂ËôûÂπ°) to order Huan to stop. After advice from Wang Biaozhi (ÁéãÂΩ™‰πã), however, he instead asked Sima Yu to write a carefully worded letter to Huan, persuading Huan to stop. Yin, meanwhile, was preparing his own campaigns, and he launched one campaign in the middle of 352 and one late in 352‚Äîthe second one being thoroughly disastrous, as he offended and intimidated the general Yao Xiang (ÂßöË•Ñ) into rebellion, and was ambushed by Yao at great loss of life and materials. The people despised Yin for his military losses, and Huan submitted a petition demanding Yin's ouster. The imperial government was compelled to demote Yin to commoner status and exile him. From that point on, the imperial government largely no longer dared to deny Huan's requests.  Northern campaigns  = Against Former Qin = With Yin out of the picture, Huan launched a major attack against one of Later Zhao's successor states, Former Qin, in 354. His army defeated much of Former Qin's resistance, reaching all the way to the vicinity of Former Qin's capital Chang'an‚Äîbut Huan hesitated at making one final assault against Chang'an. It was at this time that Huan met Wang Meng, who came to see him. Huan was impressed at Wang's knowledge and tactics, and he asked Wang why the people of the Qin lands were not shifting their allegiance to Jin, and Wang pointed out that the people were not sure what Huan's intentions were, given that he hesitated at crossing the Ba River (ÁÅûÊ∞¥), just east of Chang'an. As the situation stalemated, Huan began to run out of food supplies was forced to withdraw. He invited Wang to withdraw with him, but Wang declined, apparently believing that Huan was not the right person to follow. (Wang would eventually become the prime minister of the Former Qin emperor Fu JiƒÅn a decade later.) = Against Yao Xiang = In 356, Huan submitted a petition requesting that the capital be moved back to Luoyang‚Äîthe capital until its fall in 311 to Han Zhao - but the imperial government declined, instead ordering him to first attack Yao Xiang, who had taken many cities in the Luoyang region after rebelling against Yin Hao earlier. Huan advanced his troops to Luoyang and faced Yao in battle, and he eluded a trap Yao laid for him and dealt Yao a major defeat, forcing Yao to head west. (Yao would eventually be captured and killed by Former Qin in 357.) Huan secured the Luoyang region for Jin. He, in 362, reproposed the idea of moving the capital back to Luoyang, but the imperial government again declined. = Against Former Yan = For the next few years, Huan largely spent his effort in securing his power, as he invited many capable people to join his staff, including Xie An, Wang Tanzhi, Chi Chao, Wang Xun, and Xie Xuan. He did not carry out another northern campaign, apparently not willing to face the capable Former Yan general Murong Ke in battle. (Indeed, when Murong Ke's brother, the Former Yan emperor Murong Jun died in 360 and was succeeded by his young son Murong Wei, contrary to the optimism that many Jin officials had that with Murong Jun out of the way that Former Yan would be weakened, Huan commented, \\"Murong Ke is still alive, and I am afraid that we have an even greater problem.\\") In 364, Emperor Ai, who succeeded Emperor Mu in 361, suffered a poisoning after taking pills given to him by magicians in search of immortality, and Huan was initially summoned to the capital to serve as regent, but a second order was then issued him cancelling that summon. Instead, he set up his base at Zheqi (Ëµ≠Âúª, in modern Wuhu, Anhui) and monitored the situation at Jiankang remotely. In 365, Murong Ke attacked Luoyang, and initially, Huan and Sima Yu were planning a counterattack to relieve Luoyang, but the plan was cancelled after Emperor Ai died in spring 365. Soon, Luoyang fell. Late in 365, the Jin general Sima Xun, the governor of Liang Province (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, modern southern Shaanxi), who had participated in many campaigns, rebelled, and Huan commissioned one of his generals, Zhu Xu, to attack Sima. Sima was soon captured and killed. After Murong Ke died in 367, Huan began to plan to attack Former Yan, whose regime was now largely in the hands of Murong Wei's granduncle Murong Ping the Prince of Shangyong, regarded as incompetent and corrupt, and Murong Wei's mother Empress Dowager Kezuhun. In 369, he launched the campaign, in conjunction with Chi Chao's father Chi Yin (ÈÉóÊÑî), his brother Huan Chong, and Yuan Zhen, although he soon seized Chi Yin's troops and put them under his own command. Despite Chi Chao's advice that he head directly for Former Yan's capital Yecheng, Huan proceeded slowly, defeating Former Yan's troops repeatedly but taking three months to reach the Yellow River, stoppinging Fangtou (ÊûãÈ†≠, in modern Hebi, Henan) -- and again hesitated there at crossing the Yellow River and attacking Yecheng, not far away. Murong Wei and Empress Dowager Kezuhun were panicking and planning to flee back to the old capital Helong (ÂíåÈæç, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), but Murong Wei's uncle Murong Chui the Prince of Wu offered to make one last attempt to resist Huan. Murong Chui and his brother Murong De engaged Huan, dealing him minor losses. Meanwhile, the Jin army's food supply was running out (as a supply plan that Huan put Yuan in charge of was failing in light of the failure to build a canal quickly). Huan began to withdraw, and Murong Chui and Murong De set up a trap for Huan's army, nearly annihilating it. Soon, Former Qin forces, from which Former Yan had sought assistance from, also arrived, and Huan was dealt another major defeat. Huan, humiliated at the greatest defeat in his career, deflected blame by accusing Yuan of being unable to supply food and ordered that Yuan be demoted to commoner status. Yuan, instead of submitting, occupied Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) and rebelled, seeking assistance from both Former Yan and Former Qin. = Against Yuan Zhen's clan = With Huan's forces having been severely defeated, Yuan was able to hold Shouchun. He died in spring 370, and was succeeded by his son Yuan Qin. Huan's forces, under his generals Zhu Yao (Á´∫Áë§) and Huan Shiqian were able to defeat Former Yan and Former Qin forces sent in aid of Yuan Qin. In fall 370, Huan himself arrived at Shouchun and surrounded it. At that time, Former Yan was under a major attack by Former Qin's prime minister Wang Meng, and Former Yan forces withdrew. After Former Yan fell to Former Qin later that year, Shouchun was in even greater distress. Former Qin relief forces, sent in spring 371, were defeated by Huan. Huan then captured Shouchun and slaughtered Yuan's clan, along with the clan of his supporter Zhu Fu (Êú±Ëºî).  Removal of Emperor Fei  Huan had long considered seizing the Jin throne, and his original plan had been that if he had been able to destroy Former Yan, he would then return to Jiankang and force the imperial government to confer the nine bestowments on him, and then he could take the throne. Once, he had asked the fortuneteller Du Jiong (ÊùúÁÇÖ), who had a reputation for accurate prophecies, to see what he could achieve. Du's response was, \\"Your achievements are as great as the universe, and you will reach the highest rank among imperial subjects.\\" This made Huan rather unhappy, as he hoped to be more than an imperial subject. After recovering Shouchun, he asked Chi Chao whether the humiliation at the Battle of Fangtou had been removed‚Äîand Chi honestly told him that it had not. Instead, they planned an alternate strategy to try to showcase Huan's power‚Äîdeposing Emperor Fei. Because Emperor Fei had been cautious in his behavior and lacked faults, they decided to spread rumors that Emperor Fei was impotent and unable to bear children‚Äîand that his sons, by his concubines Consort Tian and Consort Meng, had in fact been biological sons of men whom he favored, Xiang Long (Áõ∏Èæç), Ji Hao (Ë®àÂ•Ω), and Zhu Lingbao (Êú±ÈùàÂØ∂). (The rumors also implied a homosexual relationship between Emperor Fei and Xiang, Ji, and Zhu.) He then went to the capital and intimidated Emperor Kang's wife, Empress Dowager Chu, to issue an edict that he had drafted deposing Emperor Fei. Emperor Fei was reduced to the rank of Prince of Donghai, and then further to Duke of Haixi, and put under heavy guard. Huan made his granduncle, Sima Yu, Prince of Kuaiji, emperor (as Jianwen), apparently believing that the easy-going Sima Yu would be easy to control. Meanwhile, he carried out several acts intended to both terrorize imperial officials and to affirm his power‚Äîhe deposed Emperor Jianwen's brother Sima Xi (Âè∏È¶¨Âîè) the Prince of Wuling, and killed many members of the honored Yin and Yu clans under false accusations of treason. (He wanted to kill Sima Xi as well, but Emperor Jianwen wrote humble letters to him begging for Sima Xi's life, and Huan was unable to insist on Sima Xi's death.)  Hesitation at taking the throne and death  In 372, Emperor Jianwen grew ill, and he issued four successive edits summoning Huan to the capital‚Äîa strong indicator that he was willing to yield the throne to Huan‚Äîbut Huan declined each time, apparently believing that the edicts were a trap. Indeed, Emperor Jianwen initially drafted a will that stated, \\"The Grand Marshal Huan Wen shall be regent under the precedent of the Duke of Zhou,\\" and \\"If the child can be assisted, assist him; otherwise, take the throne yourself,\\" mirroring language that Liu Bei, the founding emperor of Shu Han, used when entrusting his son Liu Shan to Zhuge Liang. With Huan not in the capital to affirm it, however, Wang Tanzhi persuaded Emperor Jianwen to tear up the will and rewrite the instructions as, \\"All major affairs shall be submitted to the Grand Marshal, under the precedents of Zhuge Liang and Wang Dao,\\" greatly reducing any legitimacy Huan might have if he should try to take the throne. Emperor Jianwen soon died, and was succeeded by his son Sima Yao the Crown Prince (as Emperor Xiaowu). With Huan not in the capital, actual power at the capital soon slipped into the hands of Xie An and Wang Tanzhi, a situation that greatly displeased Huan, who, however, when again summoned by Emperor Xiaowu and Empress Dowager Chu to serve as regent, declined. He did visit the capital in 373, and there was a rumor that he would execute Wang and Xie and then seize the throne. As Wang and Xie greeted him, however, he did not carry out the rumored actions, and after visiting the young emperor, returned to his base at Gushu (ÂßëÂ≠∞, in modern Ma'anshan, Anhui). He grew ill in fall 373, and, after entrusting matters to his brother Huan Chong, died. His domain was divided into three parts, governed by Huan Chong, another brother Huan Huo, and his nephew Huan Shixiu (Ê°ìÁü≥ÁßÄ). As Huan Chong was loyal to the imperial government, the threats of a Huan usurpation dissipated. (When, on his deathbed, Huan Wen was asked by Huan Chong what to do with Wang and Xie, his response was, \\"They will not let you handle them,\\" meaning that while Wang and Xie were not daring to disobey him while alive, they would not obey Huan Chong after his death, and that killing them would not be helpful to Huan Chong either.) Despite imperial officials' secret happiness that Huan was dead, he was formally buried with great honors.  References  * Book of Jin, vol. 98. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103.

The reserve covers significant portions of the Nimba Range, a geographically unique area with unusually rich flora and fauna, including exceptional numbers of single-site endemic species, such as viviparous toads, and horseshoe bats. Its highest peak is Mount Richard-Molard at 1,752 m (5,750 ft), which is the highest peak of both countries. History The strict nature reserve was established in 1943 by Order No. 4190 SE/F in C√¥te d'Ivoire and in 1944 by decree in Guinea. The Guinean part was accepted as a biosphere reserve in 1980. Both reserves were combined to form one World Heritage Site in 1981 (Guinea) and 1982 (C√¥te d'Ivoire). Iron-ore exploration for mining in the most vulnerable montane zone started in 1982, the reserve was listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site in danger since then. For the sake of an improved protection, a conservation management centre is being built by Guinean Parks Foundation. The project was approved by the Guinean Government and CEGENS in 2016.  Geography  The Nimba Range is a narrow ridge extending approximately 40 km long, with an orientation of northeast‚Äìsouthwest; it forms a part of the southern extent of the Guinea Highlands. Its highest peak is Mount Richard-Molard at 1,752 m (5,750 ft). Other peaks include Grand Rochers at 1694 m (5558 ft), Mont Semp√©r√© at 1682 m (5518 ft), Mont Pi√©rr√© Richaud at 1670 m (5479 ft), Mont T√¥ at 1675 m (5495 ft), and Mont LeClerc 1577 m (5174 ft). All of them are located in the Guinean part of the reserve. There are about fifty springs, including the origins of the Cavally, Cestos, and Sassandra Rivers. Mining of top-quality iron-ore poses the major threat to the unique geomorphology and wildlife.  Climate  The Nimba Range has a sub- equatorial montane climate. Temperature changes extremely with altitude, with a daytime maximum ranging between 24 ¬∞C and 33 ¬∞C, and the nightly minimum can fall below 10 ¬∞C. Some parts of the reserve receive significantly less precipitation, due to rain-shadow effect of the high ridge. In general, southern slopes are moister than the leeward northern ones which are affected by dry Harmattan wind from the Sahara. The Nimba Range, as well as the reserve has exceptional microclimatic diversity.  Ecology  Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve lies within Guinean Forests of West Africa Biodiversity Hotspot. It harbours an especially rich flora and fauna, and it is the home of more than 2000 vascular plant species, 317 vertebrate species, 107 of which are mammals, and to more than 2,500 invertebrate species. The reserve is a subject of biological surveys, because there are still large numbers of unknown species. Notably endemic vertebrates are Nimba viviparous toad (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), Lamotte's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros lamottei), and Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei). Other rare and endangered animals are West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis), pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), zebra duiker (Cephalophus zebra), and western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) that uses stones as tools. Terrestrial ecoregions include Western Guinean lowland forest, Guinean montane forest, Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, and West Sudanian savanna. The Nimba Range is a part of a distinct freshwater ecoregion with a high portion of endemic aquatic species. Terrestrial vegetation varies with altitude and cardinal orientation. * The mountain is isolated from other sky islands of Forest Guinea by the lowland West Sudanian savanna and Guinean forest-savannah mosaic. Savanna habitats are broken by gallery forests and closed canopy forest islands. * The lowland foothills are covered by the Western Guinean Lowland Forest up to 600 meters. The characteristic forest type is semi-deciduous high forest with a main canopy and an emergent layer. There are 40-70 tree species found in a single hectare, and up to 500 forest tree species recorded in the area. * Guinean Montane Forests are located between 600 and 1200‚Äì1400 meters. At lower levels, semi-deciduous high forests extend up to 900 meters; they are poorer in species compared to lowlands. Short dry forests can be found in the eastern end of the ridge. From 900 meters altitude, where the mountain is covered by clouds almost most of the year, mossy forests are present, which can be divided into three types: Parinari exclesa forests (1), summit forests (2), and tree fern forests in the valleys where ground water is abundant (3). Above the tree zone, there is a transition of Protea bushland to grassland. * Isolated high-altitude grassland extends from 1200‚Äì1400 meters to the highest peaks. There is the most famous endemic vertebrates are the Nimba viviparous toad (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), and the Lamotte's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros lamottei), the latter recorded from only one mining site. Endemic plants include among others Asplenium schnellii, Osbeckia porteresii and Blaeria nimbana.  Tourism  The Mount Nimba lies along the trination border of Guinea, C√¥te d'Ivoire, and Liberia, far away from the capital of each countries. To reach the mountain, a tiring multi-day driving is required with a 4√ó4 car in all three countries on unpaved roads across the rainforest. This isolation is the main reason for the low number of annual visitors, despite its extraordinary landscapes and wildlife, that is considered to be unique on African level. The best country to start climbing the Nimba is Guinea, because the Guinean Park Foundation organizes one-day guided hikings with aircraft transfer from Conakry. Trivia One of the four honey buzzards of Kempen-Broek that are equipped with GPS trackers passed this national park on 13 November 2013.

The wing also is responsible for the Melrose Range, an air training range near the neighboring town of Melrose, New Mexico. The commander of the 27th Special Operations Wing is Colonel Robert Masaitis.

The operational squadrons of the 27th were the 522d, 523d and 524th Fighter Squadrons. The 27th was initially equipped with the North American P-51D Mustang, and in 1948 was upgraded to the new North American F-82E Twin Mustang. In June 1948 the designation \\"P\\" for pursuit was changed to \\"F\\" for fighter. Subsequently, all P-51s were redesignated F-51s. The mission of the 27th Fighter Wing was to fly long-range escort missions for SAC Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. With the arrival of the F-82s, the older F-51s were sent to Air National Guard units. F-82Es 46-294 and 46-296 about 1948 with external tanks The first production F-82Es reached the 27th in early 1948, and almost immediately the group was deployed to McChord Air Force Base, Washington, in June where its squadrons stood on alert on a secondary air defense mission due to heightened tensions over the Berlin Airlift. It was also believed that the 27th would launch an escort mission, presumably to the Soviet Union, if conflict broke out in Europe. From McChord, the group flew its Twin Mustangs on weather reconnaissance missions over the northwest Pacific, but problems were encountered with their fuel tanks. Decommissioned F-61 Black Widow external tanks were found at Hamilton AFB, California that could be modified for the F-82 which were fitted on the pylons of the Twin Mustang that solved the problem. With a reduction in tensions, the 27th returned to its home base in Nebraska during September where the unit settled down to transition flying with their aircraft.Pape 1977, pp. 48‚Äì63. Four F-82s were deployed to Alaska from McChord where the pilots provided transition training to the 449th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron which used Twin Mustangs in the air defense mission. They remained in Alaska for about 45 days, returning to rejoin the rest of the group at the beginning of November 1948. In January 1949, Eighth Air Force planned a large celebration at Carswell Air Force Base. All of its assigned units were to participate in a coordinated flyover. Most of SAC's bombers were to participate, along with SAC's only \\"long range\\" fighter group, the 27th. The weather in Nebraska in January that year was especially horrible, with most airports in the Midwest weathered in the day of the display. At Kearney, the base was socked-in with a blizzard. Nevertheless, the crews had an early morning mission briefing, the aircraft in the hangars were preflighted and prepared for the flyover mission. Paths were cut though the snow for the aircraft to taxi and somehow the F-82s got airborne, with the 27th's Twin Mustangs joining up with SAC bombers over Oklahoma on schedule. The flyover by the Twin Mustangs was a tremendous success, with SAC leadership being amazed that the F-82 was truly an \\"all weather\\" aircraft and the 27th being able to carry out their mission despite the weather. In early 1949, the 27th began carrying out long-range escort profile missions. Flights to Puerto Rico, Mexico, the Bahamas and nonstop to Washington D.C were carried out. For President Truman's 1949 inauguration, the 27th FEW launched 48 aircraft to fly in review, along with several other fighter units, in formation down Pennsylvania Avenue. Another flyover over the newly -dedicated Idlewild Airport in New York City soon followed, with the aircraft flying non-stop from Kearney. With the tight defense budgets in the late 1940s, the decision was made by Strategic Air Command decided to close Kearney in 1949. The 27th Fighter Wing was transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base Texas on 16 March. At Bergstrom, the 27th transitioned to jet aircraft with Republic F-84E Thunderjet in 1950, and was redesignated the 27th Fighter- Escort Wing on 1 February. The wing won the Mackay Trophy for successful deployment of 90 F-84s from Bergstrom to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base West Germany, in September 1950, via Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, and England. This was the second (the first being the 20th Fighter Group flying 64 F-84Ds on 20 July 1950 during Operation Ready from Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina to RAF Manston, United Kingdom) long-range mass flight of jet aircraft in aviation history. =Korean War= : See 27th Fighter-Escort Group for more information about the wing's combat duties during the Korean War : 27th Fighter-Escort Wing F-84Gs at Hickam AFB, October 1952. The Korean War began in June 1950 and by November the wing was transferred with the advance echelon landing at Taegu AB, South Korea on 5 December and the rear echelon at Itazuke AB, Japan on 1 December. Combat operations in support of the UN ground forces began immediately and continued after the advance echelon was transferred to Itazuke in late January 1951. The 27th Fighter Escort Wing was one of the first F-84 units to see combat action in Korea and earned numerous honors and awards for their combat record during the Korean War. The 27th flew missions in support of ground forces, earning another DUC for missions between 26 January and 21 April 1951. Among these missions was close support of the largest paratroop landing in the Korean War and escort for Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers on raids over North Korea, including air-to-air combat with enemy MiG-15 fighters. For its Korean War service, the 27th Fighter- Escort Wing received the Distinguished Unit Citation, covering the period of 26 January through 21 April 1951, for their actions in Korea. The 27th was relieved of its duties supporting U.N. forces in Korea and returned to Bergstrom on 31 July 1951. Re-equipped with F-84G Thunderjets, the wing redeployed to Misawa Air Base, Japan, for a tour in providing air defense of the Japanese home islands. This mission made stops at Travis Air Force Base, California; Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and Midway Island. At Misawa, the 27th relieved the 31st Fighter-Escort Wing which had been performing the air defense mission. The 27th was itself relieved at Misawa on 13 February 1953 by the 508th Strategic Fighter Wing and returned to Bergstrom where they were re- equipped with new Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks. =Cold War= On 20 January 1953 the wing was redesignated as the 27th Strategic Fighter Wing. From June 1953 ‚Äì June 1957 the 27th had air refueling as an additional mission, with the 27th Air Refueling Squadron flying the Boeing KB-29 Superfortress tanker. Wing pilot Capt Forrest W. Wilson, in an F-84G, won the Allison Trophy jet aircraft race of the National Aircraft Show at Dayton, Ohio, on 6 September 1953, flying the 110.3-mile course at an average speed of 537.802 mph in 12:17.2 minutes. Due to the phasing out of the B-50 and B-36 and the arrival of the B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress into the SAC inventory, SAC began to phase out its strategic fighter program in 1956. It was felt that the long- range fighter escorts were no longer necessary for the new fast jet bombers. On 1 July 1957, the 27th was redesignated the 27th Fighter-Bomber Wing and was assigned to Tactical Air Command along with Bergstrom. Under TAC, the Wing was assigned to the Twelfth Air Force was re-equipped with the new McDonnell F-101A Voodoo. Consisting of the 481st, 522d, and 523d Fighter-Bomber squadrons, the mission of the 27th FBW was to deliver a centerline nuclear bomb to a target. The F-101A was capable of little else and although designated as a fighter aircraft, it had poor aerial combat capabilities and would not have fared well in any air-to-air combat against enemy aircraft. Maj Adrian E. Drew, wing F-101 project officer, broke the world speed record on 12 December 1957 when he flew an F-101A over a Mojave Desert course at 1,212.8 mph in one direction and 1,207.5 mph in the opposite direction. HQ USAF redesignated the wing the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing on 1 July 1958 as part of a worldwide naming change. On 18 February 1959, the 27th was inactivated, as SAC reacquired Bergstrom as a B-52/KC-135 base. The 27th was immediately transferred and reactivated at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, being equipped with the North American F-100 Super Sabre, replacing the 312th Tactical Fighter Wing. =Vietnam War= North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre Serial 56-3867 of the 524th TFS in Vietnam-Era camouflage. During the Vietnam War, the 27th TFW deployed individual F-100 squadrons to Southeast Asia, which included Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. Units from Cannon deployed the first F-100 squadron to Thailand in 1962‚Äì1963, and South Vietnam in 1964. Beginning in 1964 and throughout the Vietnam War years squadrons from the 27th TFW were deployed and detached to Air Force units and bases around the world. The 27th did not recombine as a cohesive wing until 1973. In December 1965, with most of its operational squadrons deployed, the mission of the 27th changed from a Tactical Fighter Wing to a replacement training unit. The 27th Tactical Fighter Wing became the largest such unit in TAC. The 4585th Student Squadron was initially activated on 1 January 1966 to perform this mission. Later, the 4429th Combat Crew Training Squadron was organized on 15 May 1968 as a second training squadron, replacing the deployed 523d TFS. Many F-100 pilots that flew in the Vietnam War trained at Cannon. From Cannon, the aircrews were transferred to the F-100 bases in South Vietnam ‚Äì Ph√π C√°t Air Base (37th TFW); Phan Rang Air Base (35th TFW) and Tuy Hoa Air Base (31st TFW). The 27th also trained forward air controllers (FACs) and air liaison officers (ALOs) in Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars from 1969 to 1976. The 4468 Tac Control Squadron initially performed this mission. In 1969, the 4468th was replaced by the '609th Tactical Control Squadron. The 609th operated the Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long-range, air surveillance radar as its primary mission equipment. The AN/TPS-43 is a transportable 3-dimensional air search radar produced in the United States originally by Westinghouse Defense and Electronic Division, which was later purchased by Northrop-Grumman. The 609th was inactivated on 15 June 1976. =Post-Vietnam era= 429th ECS General Dynamics EF-111A Ravens being retired at Davis-Monthan AFB Arizona upon arrival at AMARC, 1 April 1988. Serials 67-052 and 66-050 identifiable. With the withdrawal of the F-100 from Vietnam in 1970, and the phaseout of the aircraft from the active Air Force inventory, the 27th TFW began conversion to the General Dynamics F-111D \\"Aardvark\\". In July 1969, on loan from Nellis AFB Nevada, 10 F-111As facilitated training while the wing waited for its own planes. F-111Es began arriving in October 1969, but their stay was short. In the summer of 1971 wing aircrews ferried the last of them to RAF Upper Heyford England. In 1971, the 27th TFW received the first of its F-111Ds, and in July 1972, the last operational active duty Air Force F-100s were transferred from the 27th TFW to the Air National Guard. The mission of the 27th TFW expanded in 1988 as a result of decisions made by the Defense Department Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) when the 27th was equipped with the F-111G. (The \\"G\\" model was a conversion of the SAC FB-111A all-weather strategic bombing version of the F-111, which was originally intended as an interim successor to the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and Convair B-58 Hustler.) These aircraft, less their nuclear delivery capability, were transferred to Cannon following the disbandment of SAC's 509th Bomb Wing at Pease AFB New Hampshire and the 380th Bomb Wing at Plattsburgh AFB, New York. The F-111Gs were used primarily for training, but was scheduled to be supplanted in the training role by the F-111E. This made the F-111G surplus to USAF requirements, and the F-111G began to be transferred to AMARC for storage in 1991 with the arrival of the \\"E\\" models with the 428th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron. The last G model was sent to AMARC in 1993. Personnel of the 27th TFW played a role during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Aircrews and aircraft of the 27th did not deploy to the region, but support personnel and a combat support group element of the wing's 27th Combat Support Group, commanded by Colonel David Benson, deployed to Taif. On 16 January 1991, when the U.S. led coalition force initiated the Desert Storm air campaign against Iraq, the 27th TFW had 325 personnel serving in the Persian Gulf region in combat support roles. =1990s to today= Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, 2 June 2017. On 1 November 1991, the 27 TFW was re-designated the 27th Fighter Wing as part of an Air Force-wide reorganization. As part of the implementation of the \\"Objective Wing\\" concept adapted by the Air Force The 27th Operations Group was bestowed the lineage, honors and history of its predecessor history and honors of the 27 Tactical Fighter Group and its predecessor units. The 27 OG took control of the wing's fighter squadrons upon activation. In June 1992, the 27 FW became part of a new major command ‚Äì Air Combat Command. ACC was created when SAC, TAC, and the Military Airlift Command merged to form two commands, ACC and the Air Mobility Command. Following the enemy attacks on New York and Washington in 2001, the wing deployed personnel and aircraft globally in operations associated with the War on Terror; on 11 September 2001, aircraft from 522d FS, 523d FS and 524th FS entered alert status. Less than two weeks after the 9/11 attacks, the 27 Civil Engineer Squadron deployed members to build a bare base in direct support of Operation Infinite Justice (later changed to Operation Enduring Freedom) as one of the first units deployed to the area of operations. In December 2002, the 524 FS deployed to Kuwait and participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, dropping nearly a million pounds of precision guided munitions, more than any other F-16 Block 40 squadron in history. On 13 May 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission recommended that Cannon Air Force Base be closed. However, on 25 August 2005, the BRAC Commission overturned the recommendation that Cannon AFB be closed, but upheld the withdrawal of the base's F-16 fighter aircraft. The Air Force had until 31 December 2009 to come up with a new use for Cannon AFB, otherwise the base would be closed in 2010. Cannon AFB attempted to reopen a rejected EIS alternative, by substituting an Environmental Assessment. Comments were accepted through 4 October 2010. On 20 June 2006, it was announced that Cannon would transfer from Air Combat Command to Air Force Special Operations Command. Initial word was that the 16th Special Operations Wing would transfer from Hurlburt Field, Florida. However, it was later decided that the 27th Fighter Wing would transfer from ACC to AFSOC and become the 27th Special Operations Wing. This action entailed expanding and realigning aspects of both the 16th Special Operations Wing and Air Force Special Operations Command, also headquartered at Hurlburt Field. This designation meant that the base would receive new aircraft to replace the F-16s lost in the BRAC realignment. Jurisdiction was formally transferred to AFSOC on 1 October 2007. New airframes, including the CV-22A Osprey, were assigned to the 27 SOW at Cannon. Other aircraft included the AC-130H Spectre gunship, the MC-130J Commando II, the PC-12, the C-146A and various remotely piloted aircraft (RPA).

After his playing career, he became a professor and curator at Emory University. Early life McDaniels was born the first child of Pellom and Mary McDaniels. However, he was raised by his maternal grandparents and later went on to attend Silver Creek High School in San Jose. Collegiate career McDaniels began his undergraduate studies in Fine Arts at Oregon State University where he experienced success as a student-athlete. He played defensive end for the Oregon State Beavers. In his junior season, he had 42 tackles and a team-high 6.5 sacks. McDaniels earned 2nd team All-Pac-10 honors his senior year after finishing the season with 46 tackles and 4.5 sacks. Professional career Following his collegiate career, McDaniels worked for Procter & Gamble as a Health and Beauty Care representative in the Portland, Oregon area before pursuing a professional football career in the World League of American Football with the Birmingham Fire. In 1991, McDaniels signed his first contract in the National Football League with the Philadelphia Eagles. After having hip surgery, he spent his recovery time coaching football defensive lineman at Sunset High School in Beaverton, Oregon. Pellom spent his evenings after practice working on his own reconditioning and strength building. He was considered one of the best coaches to have worked at Sunset High according to his students. In 1992, the Kansas City Chiefs asked McDaniels to join the team‚Äôs practice roster, and from 1993 to 1998, he was a part of the heralded defense that countered NFL offenses throughout the '90s. While a member of the Kansas City Chiefs Football organization, McDaniels became a voice for Kansas City‚Äôs children and contributed the resources needed to begin the Arts for Smarts foundation. Programs like \\"Pellom and I Like Art\\", Wee Art, the \\"Fish Out Water\\" Writing program, and Smart Starts were designed to help children and young adults recognize and realize the possibilities for their futures. After spending two seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, McDaniels retired from the NFL and began his pursuit of a graduate degree at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia where he received both a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. in American Studies. He was an assistant professor in history at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City. He was an assistant professor of African American studies and faculty curator of the African American collection in the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University. Pellom McDaniels faculty page In February 2009, McDaniels was a key factor in the creation of an exhibit at the William T. Kemper Foundation Art Gallery commemorating African Americans who had fought in the First World War. UMKC professor, former NFL player to give lecture on art exhibit His publications included: \\"The Prince of Jockeys: The Life of Isaac Burns Murphy\\" (2013); So, You Want to be Pro (2000), My Own Harlem (1998); \\"We're American Too: The Negro Leagues and the Philosophy of Resistance\\" in Baseball and Philosophy: Thinking Outside the Batter's Box (2004); reviews in Hampton University's International Review of African American Art related to the work of artists Kadir Nelson and Hale Woodruff.

Life John Hambley was a native of the parish of St. Mabyn, near Bodmin, Cornwall. Hambley was converted to Catholicism by reading one of Robert Persons' books in 1582. Around Christmas that year he ceased to attend the worship established by law, and fearing the penalty entailed by absence from church decided to leave the county where he was known. He journeyed to London, where he took up abode at the \\"Sun and Seven Stars\\" in Smithfield until May 1583. During that time he was reconciled to the Catholic faith in a chamber over the gate at the \\"Red Lion\\" in Holborn by Mr. Fortescue, a seminary priest staying there.Whitfield, Joseph L., \\"Venerable John Hambley\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin H. Burton and J. H. Pollen eds.), London. Longmans, Green and Co., 1914 In early May 1583 he sailed from Rye in Sussex for Dieppe, arriving at Rheims by way of Rouen by the end of the month. He studied at Rheims and was ordained a priest 22 September 1584. Disguised as a serving man he left with Maurice Williams for the English Mission on 6 April 1585. Landing near Ipswich, they made his way to London taking up residence in the \\"Blue Boar\\". A fortnight later Hambley relocated to the \\"Red Lion\\", placing himself under the direction of the Catholic priest John Cornelius. During this time, he ministered to some of the clandestine Catholics at the Inns of Court. After about five weeks he then went to Dorsetshire and worked in the Western Counties for about a year. Around Easter 1586, he was denounced by a gentleman's servant who had once been his fellow- lodger. He was captured, then tried and condemned at Taunton; however, he denied his faith for a reprieve and then broke prison. Having fled to Salisbury, he continued his labours there until the next August. Then, on the eve of the Assumption, the Protestant Bishop of Salisbury decided to search the houses of local Catholics, suspecting that he might catch a priest saying mass. During the raids Hambley was recaptured. Now worse off than ever, he became even more afraid than before and gave up the names of most of his Catholic friends, as well as denied his faith. However, the judges did not trust his statements and he was held over for the next assizes. Then, on the next Easter, he was tried again. This third time though, he did not break, and was executed near Salisbury, \\"standing to it manfully, and inveighing much against his former fault\\".Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Ven. John Hambley.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 February 2013 No one is sure what caused him to stand firm during his final arrest. One contemporary, Father Warford, believed it was due to his guardian angel, but another, Father Gerard, with great probability, states that his strength came from a fellow prisoner, Thomas Pilchard, who later became a martyr himself.

Its last assignment was with the 27th Operations Group stationed at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. During World War II, its predecessor unit, the 17th Bombardment Squadron (Light) fought in the Philippines Campaign (1941‚Äì1942). Its ground personnel fought as infantry in the Battle of Bataan with the survivors being forced to march as prisoners in the Bataan Death March. The squadron reformed with its present numerical designation, and by the end of World War II, the Airmen of the 523d were among the most decorated USAAF units of the war, having fought in the North African, Sicilian, Italian and Southern France campaigns in the European Theater. Until its inactivation in 2007, the 523d had been engaged in every major combat action the United States had engaged in since its activation in 1940 (World War II, both Pacific and European Theaters; Korean War; Vietnam War; Operation Desert Storm; Global War on Terrorism). Operations The 523d Fighter Squadron was known as the \\"Crusaders\\". Its primary mission was to maintain a continuous ability to rapidly deploy and support American combatant commanders worldwide with day or night General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon combat operations. They were committed to employing the F-16C throughout the entire spectrum of offensive and defensive missions, including air interdiction, close air support, forward air control, strategic attack and counter-air, through employing a wide variety of conventional, precision-guided and nuclear weapons. It was inactivated in 2007 when Cannon Air Force Base and its host 27th Special Operations Wing realigned from an Air Combat Command fighter base to an Air Force Special Operations Command base with a new mission.

The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the Surrealist and Dadaist movements. In Catalan Dau al Set means \\"the seventh face of the dice\\", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.  History  Dau al Set first began as an avant-garde artistic collective led by Joan Brossa, a Catalan poet, in September 1948. Joan Brossa established the group in response to the period‚Äôs conservative reigning government, which gained power after the Spanish Civil War known as the \\"Guerra Civil\\". Under the new Spanish State, Francisco Franco radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in art and culture in Francoist Spain. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt. Such artistic groups were replaced with Nationalist Francoist Art, which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed. In 1949, with help from Joan-Josep Tharrats's private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in Catalan, a language prohibited in Francoist Spain. Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies, consisting of four to twelve pages. The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5 cm x 18.7 cm in the broadsheet style and never bound. These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve. In 1952, Dau al Set founding member Antoni T√†pies left the group to promote his own independent work in the Surrealist and Informal art styles. The following year Joan Pon√ß left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later Modest Cuixcart left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats. During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.  Style  Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of Surrealism, but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from Joan Brossa's personalized style. The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration. While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from Joan Pon√ß. Pon√ß's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work. In contrast, Modest Cuixart's work often contained images of fantasy influenced by German expressionism and Joan Mir√≥. Finally, Antoni T√°pies often emulated the style of Paul Klee with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.  Influences  Dau al Set was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being Dadaism and Surrealism. Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant- garde. This style was meant to fight against the upper class in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti- reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of cubism, collages, cut-up technique, photomontages, and assemblage which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are Francis Picabia and Max Ernst. Another influence on Dau al Set was Surrealism, a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were Joan Mir√≥, Paul Klee, Josep Vicen√ß Foix, and Salvador Dal√≠. Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.  Members  There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet Joan Brossa, a philosopher Arnau Puig, three artists Joan Pon√ß, Antoni T√†pies, and Modest Cuixart, as well as a dual painter and editor Joan-Josep Tharrats. Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as Juan Eduardo Cirlot, Antonio Saura, Enrique T√°bara, and Manolo Millares. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.

Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the Informalist movement seen in Spain during the fifties. Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties. This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the Grup d‚ÄôElx and El Paso, with important artists such as Joan Castej√≥n, Eusebio Sempere or Manolo Millares. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is Antoni T√†pies who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

Elizabeth Farm was the family home of wool pioneer, John and his wife Elizabeth Macarthur. The estate was commenced in 1793 on a slight hill overlooking the upper reaches of Parramatta River, west of Sydney Cove. This area belonged to the Burramattagal clan of the Dharug people, whose presence is recalled in the name Parramatta. The small, solid three-roomed brick cottage in the Australian Old Colonial style was transformed, by the late 1820s, into a smart country house, surrounded by 'pleasure grounds', orchards and almost of semi-cleared land. Enveloped within later extensions, the early cottage remains intact, making it Australia's oldest surviving European dwelling. The estate is managed by Sydney Living Museums as a museum that is open to the public for a modest fee. On 2 April 1999 the estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register, the first property entered on the register.  History  Romanticised painting of Elizabeth Farm viewed from the northern riverbank of Parramatta River. Joseph Lycett based this on sketches and his memories and painted it on his return to England. Elizabeth and John Macarthur arrived in 1790 with the Second Fleet. They brought with them contemporary ideas which formed the basis of their house and garden. In 1793 Governor Grose granted Macarthur near Parramatta on the west side of \\"Tipperary Farm\\". This area would increase to through grants and purchases by 1818 and proved to be almost when surveyed in 1881. The building of Elizabeth Farm commenced in 1793. It was a brick single-storey building with four rooms, a hall, closets, and cellar with an adjoining kitchen, servants apartments and other necessary offices. It remained the Macarthur family residence and Elizabeth's home until her death in 1850. The Macarthurs occupied and continually extended the house grant as their family increased to nine children and their financial position grew. Around 1805 a bedroom behind the drawing room and verandahs was added. The second kitchen was built in 1830. From 1794 Macarthur became interested in raising sheep and began to selectively crossbreed his flock at Elizabeth Farm. The house was the scene of political and social activity including visits from many governors and their wives. Elizabeth managed the farm and their other properties during the years John was in England. In his last twelve years Macarthur consulted pattern books and various architects and builders such as Henry Cooper and James Smith to prepare building plans.Bravery 1997:5-8, 27-28 John Macarthur brought olive trees (Olea europaea cv.) to Sydney in 1805 and again in 1817. Although George Suttor had introduced olives to Australia earlier, in 1800 among a collection of plants from Sir Joseph Banks, these appear not to have survived. Macarthur's olives did. John, in exile in London over his involvement with the overthrow of Governor William Bligh, sensed the mood of the British administration - who were encouraged by Suttor's reports that New South Wales had potential for horticulture due to the local climate. Macarthur set off in 1815 on a tour of France and Switzerland to study \\"the whole practice of the culture of the vine and the olive, and the making of the wine and the oil.\\" By May 1816 he was back in London with a collection of vines and olives for shipment to Australia. He was certain that these would impress Lord Bathurst, secretary of state for the colonies, and assist his return to Australia, but it took a year to get the go-ahead. He arrived in September 1817 with a cargo of \\"useful plants\\" including two olives from Provence. Five years later Macarthur made an equally favourable impression on Commissioner John Bigge who was in NSW to investigate all aspects of colonial administration, including the development of agriculture and trade. Bigge observed that Macarthur's olive trees had assimilated well to the climate and that olive oil from NSW could prove a successful export product. The settlement's British cultural background and lack of experience growing olives (commercially) and competition from the wool production industry kept olive production in the shade. Two olive trees remain at Elizabeth Farm on the front (northern) lawn. It is unclear whether these date from 1805 or 1817 introductions. However they appear to be the earliest olive trees surviving in Australia and thus, despite Suttor's introduction in 1800, Macarthur could be credited with introducing or at least successfully establishing olives in Australia, leading (at least in the late 20th century) to a growing agricultural industry.Crockett & Martin, 2009, abridged by Stuart Read, 18/8/09 In the 1820s Macarthur added a separate two storey section to the rear, and built stables. The house additions used open planning with French doors leading to the verandahs and gardens. A few years later the verandahs may have been remodelled. A Doric columned north verandah in contrast to the treillage of the eastern verandah was added during 1826. Further extensions were made during 1826 and 1827, designed by Henry Cooper. Refacing of the servants quarters, possibly by John Verge, took place sometime around 1833. In this year John Macarthur moved to their property at Camden and died there in 1834. In 1872 Edward Macarthur died leaving Elizabeth Farm to his niece Elizabeth Onslow, the daughter of his brother James, but allowing his wife Sarah a lifetime interest in it. The Macarthur family sold Elizabeth Farm Estate in 1881. From 1852 Elizabeth Farm was occupied by various tenants and agents, including William Billyard, Crown Solicitor of NSW from 1875 until 1883. The new owner, Septimus Stephen, subdivided the land and put the house block up for auction. There were further subdivisions in 1884. The house was leased variously as a boarding house and glue factory. It was purchased as a house and six acres by William and Elizabeth Swann and family in 1904 for the land value only. The house was in a state of dilapidation. They immediately proceeded to have it cleansed, disinfected and repaired. The family became an institution in Parramatta, their house based activities including music, education, a secretarial school and dental surgery. The Swann family owned and occupied the house until 1968 when it was purchased by the Elizabeth Farm Management Trust. A Friends of Elizabeth Farm group formed well before the formation of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.Watts, 2014 In 1973 the State Planning Authority assumed control of Elizabeth Farm. Between 1978 and 1983 the Public Works Department and the Heritage Council of NSW restored the buildings, which were considered important as a record of the oldest surviving examples of colonial construction techniques in Australia.Bravery, 1997, 5-8, 27-28 Architectural documentation and conservation works on the buildings were supervised by project architect Ian Sansom, Government Architect's Branch. Conservation policy and landscape proposals for the garden and grounds were developed by the Landscape Section, Government Architect's Branch, in consultation with the Historic Houses Trust (HHT) and Heritage and Conservation Branch. A. W. Edwards P/L was engaged to carry out restoration of lath and plaster work. A detailed property title search was carried out. Anne Bickford, archaeologist was engaged to continue research, particularly in regard to the carriage way and former outbuildings. Discussions continued with the HHT regarding its likely requirements for ancillary facilities on the site. Consultation continued with Parramatta City Council re future management of the reserve surrounding Elizabeth Farm. A draft conservation plan was prepared by the HHT in 1982. The HC SR Committee formed a sub-committee with representatives of the Heritage & Conservation Branch, HHT and co-opted members to increase involvement of the HHT in works being carried out with a view to eventual transfer of the property to the Trust for management as a house museum.HC, 1982 The site was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust of NSW in 1983 and opened to the public as a house museum in 1984. Since then the Friends of the Historic Houses Trust has raised funds to allow entry display refurbishment, lighting and iPad interpretation ($38,000), soft-furnishings ($33,000) and reproduction of Elizabeth Macarthur's ivory workbox ($8000) as well as organising and supporting the successful annual Festival of the Olive event, which attracts a wide range of visitors to the property.  Description  Elizabeth Farm House is a single-storey late 18th century English vernacular cottage with a pair of sash windows either side of the front door and four box-like rooms. Extensions since the initial building phase have increased the number of rooms The walls are hand pressed clay bricks rendered and coursed to simulate stone. Ironbark floors and cedar joinery complement the plaster walls.Bravery 1997:5 The original shingled hipped roof is continuous over the front verandah which is now clad with corrugated iron and supported by cast iron columns. The garden contains many trees planted by Elizabeth Macarthur, araucarias, kurrajongs, a Chinese elm and a pair of olive trees.Parramatta River REP 22 Inventory No: 123 Elizabeth Farm comprises three connecting buildings - the main house, a rendered brick verandahed bungalow with shingled roof under painted galvanised iron, single storeyed kitchen wing, two cellars and a two storeyed servants quarters with dairy and laundry on almost one hectare of land. It is bounded by Alice Street and the Elizabeth Farm Reserve adjoining Alice, Alfred and Arthur Streets, Parramatta near the Parramatta River. A timber shed (the remains of outbuildings) purpose built tearooms and amenities block are subsidiary structures.Bravery 1997:3 test It was reported to be in good physical condition, with medium archaeological potential, as at 24 March 2016.

Impressive cedar joinery has been restored while carefully reproduced paint schemes, fabrics and floor coverings provide an authentic impression of this early 19th-century household. The Macarthur's garden of native and exotic ornamentals, fruit trees and vegetables has been recreated around original plantings and archaeological features dating to the early 19th century. Avoiding the use of rope barriers and screens, an innovative 'hands on' approach encourages visitors to explore and interact with this evocative historical environment: sitting in chairs, leafing through letters, playing the piano or pulling up beside an open fire. Elizabeth Farm is open to the general public.  Heritage listing  Elizabeth Farm is associated with major figures who were prominent in the 19th century development of the colony, including John and Elizabeth Macarthur, and the Swann family in the 20th century. There is a large surviving collection of documentary evidence connected to the house, which contains part of the oldest surviving European construction in Australia. The garden contains some of the earliest European plantings in Australia including a Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia), 1805-planted olive (Olea europaea), kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus), Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii). It is an example of early colonial architecture and early agricultural experiments.Bravery 1997:13-14, 24, modified Read, S., 11/2006 The property forms the core of a major historic farm estate which was highly influential in the development of the wool industry in Australia, the introduction and acclimatisation of plants and economic crops such as olives and vines. By its size, location and history of subdivision the property was influential on the development of the town of Parramatta. The property is also significant in the history of conservation in NSW, being the first to be preserved by direct acquisition by the State Government, and the second property to have a permanent conservation order placed over it under the Heritage Act 1977.Read, S., pers. comm. 2003 Elizabeth Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Elizabeth Farm is significant because of its association with major figures, in particular Elizabeth and John Macarthur, who were prominent in the early 19th century agricultural, political, cultural and architectural development of the colony. It was the centre of an estate on which some of the first experiments in pastoral and agricultural land use in Australia took place, particularly in the early development of the wool industry. It is associated with the Swann family for over sixty years, including their preservation of the buildings. The farm house is part of a group of early colonial buildings (including Old Government House, Hambledon Cottage and Experiment Farm) which reflect Parramatta's importance as an early agricultural area and as the second most important settlement in the colony. The house's range of building styles reflect the adaption of traditional European architecture to the prevailing Australian climate. The house is a record of the architectural ideas and ambitions of the colony's first fifty years. The house shows growth from a vernacular cottage to a comfortable family home with some sophisticated detailing, all reflecting the development of colonial life. The house is representative of the work of architects Henry Cooper and John Verge. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house is one of the most evocative houses relating to the earliest period of Australian European history and is one of the most aesthetically pleasing of colonial bungalows. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The farm has strong links with the Parramatta community.Bravery 1997: 13-14 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The garden contains remnants of some of the earliest European plantings in Australia, including the European Olive. Older indigenous species include kurrajong and bunya bunya and hoop pines. The farm has a large surviving collection of original documentary evidence relating to the house and its occupants, and the existence of some of the earliest provenanced furniture. The house is an example of the development of Australian building methods in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Elizabeth Farm house is part of the oldest surviving construction in Australia and a rare survival of the earliest period of colonial architecture.

Biography He began painting and writing in 1947 in Madrid while suffering from tuberculosis, having already been confined to his bed for five years. In his beginnings he created numerous drawings and paintings with a dreamlike surrealist character that most often represented imaginary landscapes, employing a flat smooth treatment that offers a rich palette of colors. He claimed Hans Arp and Yves Tanguy as his artistic influences. He stayed in Paris in 1952 and in 1954‚Äì1955 during which he met Benjamin P√©ret and associated with the Surrealists, although he soon parted with the group, joining instead the company of his friend the painter Simon Hanta√Ø. Using the technique of scraping, he adopted a gestural style and created an abstract type of painting, still very colorful with an organic, aleatory design. The first appearances in his work of forms that will soon become archetypes of the female body or the human figure occur in the mid-1950s. Starting in 1956 Saura tackled the register of what will prove to be his greatest works: women, nudes, self-portraits, shrouds and crucifixions, which he painted on both canvas and paper. In 1957 in Madrid he founded the El Paso Group and served as its director until it broke up in 1960. During this period Saura met Michel Tapi√©.https://issuu.com/iqunvitalis1973/docs/brochure_michel_tapi__/4 During the 1950s he had his first solo exhibition at the Rodolphe Stadler Gallery in Paris, where he regularly exhibited throughout his life. Stadler introduced him to Otto van de Loo in Munich and Pierre Matisse in New York City, both of whom exhibited his work and represented him, and eventually his paintings were collected by major museums. Limiting his palette to blacks, grays and browns, Saura asserted a personal style that was independent of the movements and trends of his generation. His work followed in the tradition of Velasquez and Goya. Starting in 1959 he began creating a prolific body of works in print, illustrating numerous books including Cervantes's Don Quijote, Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, N√∂stlinger's adaptation of Pinocchio, Kafka‚Äôs Tageb√ºcher, Quevedo‚Äôs Three Visions, and many others. In 1960 Saura began creating sculptures made of welded metal elements which represented the human figure, characters and crucifixions. In 1967 he settled permanently in Paris, and joined the opposition to Francoist Spain. In France he participated in numerous debates and controversies in the fields of politics, aesthetics and artistic creation. He also broadened his thematic and pictorial register. Along with his Femmefauteuil (literally \\"Womanarmchair\\"), he also worked on the series \\"Imaginary Portraits\\",and Goya‚Äôs Dog and Imaginary Portraits of Goya begin to take shape. In 1971 he temporarily abandoned painting on canvas to devote himself to writing, drawing and painting on paper. In 1977, Rolf Lauter and Antonio Saura met for the first time in the Rodolphe Stadler gallery Paris and started a dialogue and a long-standing friendship.

He was one of the most prominent leaders of that country's Christian Democratic Party. Born in Antofagasta, Tomic received his law degree from the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (UC), where he first became involved in political activity, in the Social Christian Party. One of the co-founders in 1938 of the Falange Nacional (later the Christian Democrat Party of Chile or PDC), he became president of the party 1946‚Äì1947 and 1952‚Äì1953. He was married to Olaya Err√°zuriz Echenique, and together they had 9 children. Among other activities Tomic was director of the newspaper El Tarapac√° of Iquique (1937‚Äì1941) and later of the Editorial del Pac√≠fico. Tomic served as deputy for Arica, Pisagua and Iquique (1941‚Äì1949). When senator and poet Pablo Neruda was banned by the Ley de Defensa Permanente de la Democracia (Law for the Permanent Defense of Democracy)‚Äîwhich banned the Communist Party of Chile and removed numerous voters from the rolls)‚ÄîTomiƒá won the vacated seat in a by-election.

In 1965 he resigned his senatorial seat to become Chile's ambassador to the United States (4 March 1965 ‚Äì April 1968). As leader of the progressive wing of the Christian Democrats, he was the party's presidential candidate in the 1970 election in which Salvador Allende won a plurality and, with Tomic's support, was ratified by parliament as president. Allende died three years later in the Chilean coup of 1973, which put an end to democracy in Chile for over 15 years. As a parliamentarian and politician Tomic was a defender of Chilean sovereignty over the country's copper deposits and in the nationalization of that industry. In 1997, CODELCO named a mine in his honor. Tomic died in 1992 in Santiago. References * This article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the Spanish Wikipedia.

A shoemaker by trade, he commanded the Warsaw Uprising of 1794, an uprising against the Russian garrison in Warsaw. He also became a member of Polish provisional government. Biography Statue of Kili≈Ñski in Warsaw by Stanis≈Çaw Jackowski Jan Kili≈Ñski was born in Trzemeszno, a minor town in the historical region of Greater Poland. In 1780 he settled in Warsaw, where he became a shoemaking master in 1788. One of the most prominent burghers of the time, he was elected member of the city council three times in a row between 1791 and 1793. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1794, Kili≈Ñski formed a unit of National Militia and led his forces, along with the forces of the regular army, against the Russian occupation forces. On April 19 of that year, following the Russian withdrawal, he signed the Access of the city of Warsaw to the Ko≈õciuszko's Uprising and entered the Provisional Temporary Council, a temporary ruling body of the city. The council was soon disbanded and passed its powers to Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, and Kili≈Ñski focused on strengthening his militias. His forces grew to over 20,000 men at arms and on 28 June 1794 were dispatched to the front to link up with the regular Polish Army. On 2 July the same year Ko≈õciuszko promoted Kili≈Ñski to the rank of Colonel. After the failure of the uprising, Kili≈Ñski was arrested by the Prussian authorities and handed over to the Russians, who then imprisoned him in the Peter and Paul Fortress, in St. Petersburg. Upon his release in 1796, he lived in Vilna for a short time. However, he was yet again arrested for conspiracy against the tsarist authorities and forcibly resettled in Russia.

History The first 400 GT, commonly referred to as simply the 400 GT or 400 GT Interim, was essentially the older 350 GT featuring an enlarged, 3,929 cc V12 engine, with a power output of . Twenty- three of these cars were built, with three featuring aluminium bodywork. alt= The second 400 GT, commonly known as the 400 GT 2+2, had a different roofline, and minor sheetmetal changes compared to the 350 GT and first 400 GT. It was first presented at the 1966 Geneva Auto Show. The larger body shape enabled the +2 seating to be installed in the rear, where the 350 GT only had room for luggage or +1 seating. The bodywork was designed by Carrozzeria Touring. The 400 GT 2+2 also had a Lamborghini designed gearbox, with Porsche style synchromesh on all gears, which greatly improved the drivetrain. When leaving the factory the 400 GT originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72). A total of 23 units of the 400 GT Interim and 224 units of the 400 GT 2+2 were built from 1966 to 1968, when it was replaced with the Islero. The 400 GT 2+2, 400 GT Interim and the 350 GT all shared the same wheelbase. 400 GT Monza The Lamborghini 400 GT Monza was a one-off two-seater sports car based on the 400 GT \\"Interim\\", featuring unique bodywork by the shop of Neri and Bonacini, who were already previously known for their work on the \\"Nembo\\" series of Ferraris. Giorgio Neri and Luciano Bonacini were initially hired by Ferruccio Lamborghini in 1963 to construct the chassis of and assemble the first prototype Lamborghini, the 350 GTV. Following this, they supplied some early production chassis, before turning that job over to Marchesi once series production of the 350 GT was well underway. Through this pre-existing relationship with Lamborghini, Neri and Bonacini were commissioned to create a one-off two-seater sports car based on a 350 GT chassis (number 01030) and a 400 GT V-12 engine. Possibly built for an unknown American client to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the car was completed in 1966 and named the 400 GT Monza. The original name was the \\"400GT Neri and Bonacini,\\" but the final name Monza was eventually chosen due to its brevity and evocation of racing history. The aluminum body was hand built in the Neri and Bonacini shop and went through many revisions during the fabrication process. The final result was a distinctive fastback, with a long hood and Kamm tail. The designers integrated a roll bar into the extremely thick C-pillar, possibly increasing roll-over safety but compromising rearward visibility. Other details included a very low and raked windshield, prominent but non-functional air vent grilles behind the front wheels and stylized \\"400 Monza\\" badging. Overall, the design shows visual similarities to other contemporary Italian sports cars such as the Bizzarrini 5300 GT and the Lamborghini Miura. Homologation problems prevented the car from ever racing and the American customer who commissioned it apparently never received the car. It was instead displayed at the 1967 Barcelona Motor Show on the Lamborghini importer Amato's stand. A wealthy Spaniard purchased it at the show and the 400GT Monza remained in his family after his death in the early 1990s. In 1996, auction house Brooks (now Bonhams) discovered the car in storage when they were contacted by the family of the now deceased owner to appraise some other cars. After nine years of negotiations, the car was finally sold at Bonhams' December 2005 auction in London for ¬£177,500 GBP.

Local stations also featured their own coverage during time local breaks, which varied from traditional breaks for local news and weather to full-scale coverage of local countdowns and possible Y2K bug effects (which in ABC and local coverage, eventually became minimal as little to any issues came out of that). ABC had a total of more than 1,000 members of their news division part of the broadcast. They were all under the direction of ABC's Roger Goodman. Guests included famed Australian comedian Dame Edna, David Blane, comedian Al Franken, and longtime ABC anchor Howard K. Smith. Musical performances included the Bee Gees, Neil Diamond, Faith Hill, Enrique Iglesias, Kenny G, Charlotte Church, Billy Joel, Barry Manilow, Bonnie Raitt, *NSYNC, James Taylor, Christina Aguilera (who performed at the MTV studios across the street), Aerosmith, and Phish. Phish's appearance was live via satellite from their Big Cypress festival. Broadcast highlights right Originally, the name of the broadcast was ABC 2000, but it was officially retitled as ABC 2000 Today because ABC joined 60 other nations, all celebrating the dawn of the new millennium. The network was part of the 2000 Today consortium that included PBS, WGBH, the BBC in the United Kingdom, STAR TV, ATV, TVB, Phoenix Television, and CETV in Hong Kong, RCTI, SCTV, TPI, Anteve, Indosiar and MetroTV (test of transmission) in Indonesia, RTM, STMB, Mega TV and Astro in Malaysia, CCTV in China, TCS, CNA, TV12 and Singapore Cable Vision in Singapore, ABC in Australia, TV Asahi in Japan, MBC in South Korea, SABC in South Africa, TVE in Spain, Globo in Brazil, GMA Network in the Philippines, RTL in Germany, RTP in Portugal, TV3 in New Zealand, Televisa in Mexico, TVN in Chile, and the CBC in Canada. (The program was nonetheless consistently promoted under the ABC 2000 name, possibly to avoid confusion with the U.S. morning show Today, which airs on rival network NBC.) This was by far the most comprehensive coverage of any of the broadcast networks. By contrast, CBS had hourly updates throughout the day with Dan Rather, a special 8 pm edition of the Late Show with David Letterman and from 10pm-1am ET, Rather and actor and rapper Will Smith hosted America's Millennium live from Times Square and Washington D.C. respectively. It was the only time since 1996 that CBS offered live New Year coverage. NBC had an extended edition of The Today Show, Dateline NBC at 8 pm and from 9pm-3am ET, Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric anchored NBC's millennium coverage, which included a special edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which took part in the millennium celebrations in Los Angeles. Peter Jennings stayed on the air for the entire duration without a break using only commercial breaks and correspondent pieces to rest, eat, or change suits. He changed his wardrobe four times, including wearing a tuxedo when the ball was dropping at Times Square, and a sweater at the end of the ABC 2000 Today broadcast. At least 175 million Americans tuned into some portion of ABC 2000 Today. The broadcast won a Peabody Award. The theme music for ABC 2000 Today (which was also used for ABC News' election coverage that year) was from Epcot's IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth live show. The music was composed by Gavin Greenaway, who won an Emmy award for the work. Footage of IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth were shown in the opening and closing sequences. Follow-up ABC News also used Times Square Studios for ABC News's 2000 election coverage ABC 2000: The Vote, with the studio set up very similar to the ABC 2000 Today studio set up, except the large screen was used to show the map of the United States with all the red and blue states. For 2002, ABC preceded the primetime hour of New Year's Rockin' Eve with a follow-up special, ABC 2002. The two-hour special featured a \\"meaningful and reflective\\" view on New Year's celebrations from around the world (especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks), and performances by Arlo Guthrie, Sting, and U2. It was hosted by Jennings from the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City.

It consists of a well- preserved palm forest, flagship species made up of the island endemic coco de mer, as well as five other endemic palms. The coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica), a monocot tree in the Arecaceae (palm family), has the largest seeds (double nut seed) of any plant in the world. Also unique to the park is its wildlife, including birds such as the rare Seychelles black parrot, mammals, crustaceans, snails, and reptiles. There has been a determined effort to eliminate all the introduced exotic species of plants from the area but this has not been successful in eliminating coffee, pineapple, and ornamental palms thus far. This forest, with its peculiar plant and animal species, is a relict from the time when the supercontinent of Gondwana was divided into smaller parts, leaving the Seychelles islands between the present day Madagascar and India. Geography The reserve is in the middle of the Praslin Island which is the second largest island in Seychelles, where the highest mountain, Fond Azore, rises to a height of . Praslin is in area . It is located to northeast of Mahe, about away It is the lower region of a valley near the head of a stream. It covers an area of a 19.5 ha and is in a virgin state, and is traced to the prehistoric times. The geological formation is of granite as is the entire island; called as a \\"microcontinent\\", its evolution is not of volcanic or coraline origin as is the other islands in the Indian Ocean. Legend The double nut of coco de mer The British General Charles George Gordon propagated a myth in the 19th century after he visited the island on a military mission in 1881. Based on a Kabbalistic review of the Book of Genesis, he visioned Vall√©e de Mai as the Garden of Eden. He had said that he had corroborative proof to support this. His theory was that the palm tree was the tree of knowledge representing both good and evil, and that the breadfruit tree introduced into the island, was the tree of life. He even went to the extent of marking the exact location of the Garden of Eden on the island as the ‚Äò'Coco-de-mer\\" valley. Only in this reserve, apart from the endemic coco de mer (which he considered as the forbidden fruit due to its reputed aphrodisiac quality), are all of Seychelles' endemic palm species found together. His observation was that the peculiar suggestive shape of its fruits was to have \\"caused the plague of our forefathers in the Garden of Eden\\". His observation was contested by another writer H. Watley Estridge who pointed out to Gordon that the thick husk of the fruit was impossible to have been bitten through by Eve, to which Gordon had no plausible answer. The endemic black parrot almost exclusively nests in the dead standing trunks of this palm. History The park was an undisturbed virgin forest till the 1930s. The locale got the status of Nature Reserve under the Wild Birds Protection (Nature Reserves) Regulation S. I. 27/1696, on 18 April 1966. This was followed by changing the status to a National Park for better conservation and preservation actions under the National Parks and Nature Conservancy Act (Cap. 159) S.I. No. 57 of 1979, Praslin National Park (Designation) Order of 1979, and the Cocooode- Management Decree 1978. Inscribed by UNESCO in 1983 under Criterion (vii), (viii),(ix), and (x), Vall√©e de Mai is one of the organization's smallest natural World Heritage Sites. Flora The park is the habitat for endemic coco-de-mer, which is reported as the \\"flagship species of global significance\\" growing to a height of . It is fan-shaped with leaves long and wide, and its petioles (stems) are long. The tree bears the largest double nut with the largest seed, among the species of the plant biodiversity found in the world; the weight of its largest fruit was . This tree is made up of stilt roots and has its canopy formed by leaves. The roots and the trunk are not easily distinguishable and they bear fruits of round and oval shape. There are five other endemic palm species; millionaire's salad (Deckenia nobilis), thief palm (Phoenicophorium borsigianum), Seychelles stilt palm (Verschaffeltia splendida) latanier millepattes (Nephrosperma vanhoutteanum) and latanier palm (Roscheria melanochaetes). These six species of palms are not only unique to this reserve but also to the Seychelles, and are not found anywhere else in the Indian Ocean in its pristine ancient state of evolution. The forest is dense with Pandanus screw palms and broad leaf trees. Chrysobalanus icaco Cocoplum is also reported. The aesthetic beauty of this natural palm forest is a grand display of an array of green, red and brown palm fronds. Some amount of supplementation has occurred in the plantation of these species of palms with the only intent of maintaining the ecosystem. There are some 4000 palm trees in the park (5,000 is also mentioned of equal number of male and female species). Two other endemic trees in the park are Dillena furruginea also known as bwa rouz and Northea hornei or the Kapisen. Takamaka trees are the entrance to the park and when they flower Seychelles sun birds feed on the nectar of the flowers. Shy tenrec have been introduced into the park from Madagascar. Fauna The prominent avifauna, both endemic and global species, with the palm trees as their habitat, are: the Seychelles black parrot (Coracopsis barklyi) (called an \\"enigmatic bird\\" that feeds on the fruits of the palm trees and they are akin to the vasa parrots of Madagascar), Alectroenas pulcherrimus (Seychelles blue pigeon); Hypsipetes crassirostris (Seychelles bulbul); Nectarinia dussumieri (Seychelles sunbird); Collocalia francica (Mascarene swiftlet); and Falco araea (Seychelles kestrel). Other animals are Archaius tigris (tiger chameleon); Trachylepis seychellensis (Seychelles skink); Mabuya wrightii (Wright's skink); Scelotes braueri; Pamelaescincus gardineri (Gardiner's burrowing skink) (skinks are seen on the floor of the park); tiger chameleons; Ailuronyx seychellensis (Seychelles bronze gecko); caecilians and tree frogs. Phelsuma astriata (Seychelles small day gecko); and Phelsuma sundbergi (Seychelles giant day gecko). Reptile species are; Boaedon geometricus (Seychelles house snake); Lycognathophis seychellensis (Seychelles wolf snake); and Ramphotyphlops braminus (blind snake). Six species of caecilians, a group of worm-like amphibians, are reported from the deep moist soil layers of the park. Seychelles treefrogs (Tachycnemis seychellensis) are seen hugging the tree leaves. Mollusca found in the park are Praslin snail (Pachnodus paslinus) which has a twirled and pointed shell, and the large Stylodonta studeriana. They are found to feed on the palm coco de mer; the male feeds on the flowers on the catkin of the male coco de mer. The endemic golden panchax (Pachypanchax playfairi) is the only freshwater fish endemic to the Seychelles. There are also several freshwater crustaceans and other invertebrates in the park.

Life Ingram was probably the son of Anthony Ingram of Wolford, Warwickshire, by Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Hungerford. He began his education in Worcestershire and attended New College, Oxford. He then converted to Catholicism and studied at the English College, Rheims, at the Jesuit College, Pont-a-Mousson, and at the English College, Rome. He was ordained at Rome in 1589; and then, early in 1592, he went to Scotland. There he befriended many powerful people. He acted as chaplain to Walter Lindsay of Balgavie for 18 months. Captured at Wark in Northumberland having crossed into England over the River Tweed on 25 November 1593, he was first imprisoned at Berwick, then at Durham, York, and in the Tower of London, where he was severely tortured and wrote twenty Latin epigrams, which survive. One of Ingram's epigrams gives us a glimpse of his long ride from York to London: > My lesser jade often changed his whiteness, > and made be black too with the mud of his splashing. And another on his arrival: > The day, on which the unquenched love of the Faith > made me behold the grim prison of the Tower. He arrived at the Tower of London on Holy Saturday, 17 April 1593. He was hung by the joints of his fingers and arms, and was in extreme pain for so long that the feeling of his senses was taken completely from him. He was often put on the rack, and the Queen's torturer, Richard Topcliffe, remarked that he remained utterly silent and gave no information about persons and places. He was taken from London on 13 July to return to York prison with another Catholic priest, John Boste. The two prisoners' feet were tied under their horse's belly, for fear of them trying to escape. Care was also taken that the horses were kept far enough apart to prevent the prisoners having any communication with each other throughout the journey. When they arrived in York, Ingram was in solitary confinement in a stinking vault of a locked jakehouse for four days, without either bed to lie on or stool to sit on. From York he was transported to Newcastle and imprisoned in the Newgate prison there for four nights, probably from 19 to 22 July. A woman visitor to the prison was struck by the serenity and joy of the priest, who said that he had good cause to be merry, because his wedding-day being at hand, the bridegroom must be glad, for within ten days he hoped to enjoy his Spouse. She remarked that it was true his hope was good, but his banquet was deadly; but he answered that the reward was sweet. The serenity and courage of John Ingram is reflected in two letters he wrote from prison to his friends or fellow prisoners in the same prison: \\"I look for my trial on Thursday and consequently for my death in God's honour ( ...) in my pained body; my spirit is not pained, nor in any disaster, distress or durance.\\" Death and beatification At Durham Assizes he was tried with John Boste and George Swallowell, a converted Protestant minister. There on 23 July 1594 Ingram and Boste were convicted under a law which made the mere presence in England of a priest ordained abroad high treason, even though there was no evidence that he had ever acted as a priest while in England.\\"Act against Jesuits, Seminary priests and other such like disobedient persons\\" (27 Eliz. c. 2) Matthew Hutton (1529-1606), the Bishop of Durham, acting for the Crown, preached a sermon before the judges, incensing them to prosecute with all vigour the justice, or rather cruelty, of the law against seminary priests, their aiders and abettors. There is evidence that someone in Scotland offered the English Government a thousand crowns to spare Ingram's life, all in vain. After the intervention of the Bishop of Durham before the court, the trial was a foregone conclusion and John Ingram, John Boste and a layman George Swallowell, a converted Protestant minister, were sentenced to death on Wednesday 24 July. When John Ingram was asked according to the usual formula, what he had to say that he should not receive judgement, he made this answer, \\"I say that I am a priest, and that my exercise and practice of priesthood cannot be made treason by any Christian law; and I beseech God to forgive both you and them that make it otherways. And I do with all my heart forgive you, and all my accusers and persecutors, and so I beseech God to have mercy upon me, and to strengthen me with patience and constancy in mine agony.\\" As the authorities in Newcastle were responsible for executions on Tyneside, John was transferred to Newgate Prison in Newcastle and on the day of execution, Friday 26 July, he was taken from the prison across the bridge (now where the Swing Bridge is located) to the scaffold in Gateshead High Street which was directly opposite what was known at the time as the Papist Chapel, the Chapel of St Edmund Bishop and Confessor. Immediately prior to his execution he was held for a short while in the Toolboth in Gateshead, a small local gaol very close to the place of execution. The costs of the execution were as follows in Newcastle City Accounts Book: \\"Paide for charges att the execution of the semynarie priete in Gateside John Ingram ‚Äì 2 shillings and 6 pence. Paide for hinginge his quarters of the gibbettes: 18 pence and for panyer which brought his quarters to towne 4 pence ‚Äì 22 pence. Paide for a locke for towlboothe dore in Gateside ‚Äì 3 shillings 4 pence.\\" His severed head was placed on a spike and displayed on the bridge across the Tyne. Holtby gives an account of Ingram's preparations, the prayers he said, his words to the bystanders, and of the execution itself: \\"I take God and his holy angels to the record, that I die only for the holy Catholic faith and religion, and do rejoice and thank God with all my heart that hath made me worthy to testify my faith therein, by the spending of my blood in this manner.\\" He was asked to pray for the Queen and he prayed God that she might long reign to his glory, and that it might please him to procure her to live and die a good Catholic Christian prince. With rope around his neck he said more prayers, ending with the psalm Miserere mei Deus (Have mercy on me, O God, in your kindness), after which, making the sign of the Cross upon himself and saying, \\"In manus tuas ,,.\\" (Into Thy hands I commend my spirit), the ladder was turned; and being dead, he was cut down, bowelled, and quartered. In the Tower of London, John Ingram had written these words of an epigram in Latin, > The expectation of a bloody death is another death, > which grins at me, her grey hairs steeped in gore. Another epigram read: > Rocks are quarried, the entrails of the earth, that Dives may have living > rock for his tomb. > No tomb seek I; and yet shall there be a living tomb for my lifeless body ‚Äì > the carrion-crow. In Rome, at the English College, when the news of his martyrdom reached there, the staff and students sang the Te Deum in the college chapel and wrote against his name \\"Martyro insigni coronatus\\". He was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI and his anniversary is 24 July. His martyrdom is commemorated each year by faithful Catholics who gather at St Andrew's Anglican Church in Newcastle, which is situated where John Ingram was held in the Newgate Prison prior to his execution. After a brief service of prayer, they walk along the route taken by the execution party, from Newcastle to Gateshead High Street, crossing the river Tyne over the Swing Bridge, where the medieval bridge stood. The Annual John Ingram Walk concludes with service of prayer at the Anglican church of St Edmund (Holy Trinity Church) which is situated in the High Street. The Catholic priest who leads this Walk usually delivers a homily at St Edmund's. At the time of Protestant Reformation this church was referred to as \\"the papist chapel\\", and the authorities chose to execute John Ingram directly in front of this chapel, dedicated to St Edmund of Canterbury, as a warning to any Catholics on Tyneside, of which there were many, should they think of refusing to comply with the requirements of the Queen, her Privy Council, and her Protestant bishops. The brothers of the St Vincent de Paul Society Conference at Corpus Christi Catholic Church in the Bensham area of Gateshead initiated the annual walk in his honour, a few years after the Canonization of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales by Pope Paul VI, and after speaking to the elderly Father Starr, a Catholic priest who had had a personal devotion to the Gateshead martyr for many years and had made a walk in his honour. Their motive from the start was to promote the cause for the canonization of John Ingram.

A modern gaming computer is comparable to a mainstream computer with the addition of performance-oriented components, such as high-performance video cards and high core-count central processing units, that sacrifice power efficiency for raw performance. Gaming computers are often associated with enthusiast computing due to an overlap in interests; however, while a gaming computer is built to achieve performance for actual gameplay, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a real application benchmark. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end markets. Video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. Gaming PCs are often also suitable for other intensive tasks, like video editing. Because of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are frequently custom-assembled, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies that specialize in producing custom gaming machines.  History  Historically, gaming computers had several distinct hardware components that set them apart from a typical PC. The push for better graphics began with color fidelity, from display systems such as CGA eventually graduating to VGA, which was adopted for the mass market. Gaming also led the push for the adoption of sound cards, a component that is now commonly integrated onto motherboards. In the 1980s, several non-IBM PC compatible platforms gained a measure of popularity due to advanced graphics and sound capabilities, starting with the Atari 400/800 and the TI 99/4, and then continuing with others such as the Commodore 64 and eventually the Amiga. Video game developers of the time targeted these platforms for their games, though typically they would later port their games to the more common PC and Apple platforms as well. The MSX was also popular in Japan, where it preceded the video game console revolution. Japan also had several other popular gaming computers during the 1980s to early 1990s, including the very popular PC-88 and PC-98 as well as the powerful X68000 and FM Towns. By 1993, PC-compatibles were the standard for gaming in the US. Computer Gaming World stated in January: In September, the magazine replied to a reader asking for \\"the current '486' desktop dream machine for playing computer games\\": Falcon Northwest began advertising in Computer Gaming World in 1993, claiming that the \\"Falcon MACH series are the first personal computers designed especially for the serious gamer in mind\\". Computer Gaming World reiterated in 1994, \\"we have to advise readers who want a machine that will play most of the games to purchase high-end MS-DOS machines\\". The magazine reported in August that the 80486DX at 33 MHz was the \\"minimum machine for the rest of 1994\\". LAN parties helped to promote the use of network cards and routers among consumers. This equipment is now commonly used by non-gamers with broadband Internet access to share the connection with multiple computers in the home. Like sound cards, network adapters are now commonly integrated onto motherboards. In modern times, the primary difference between a gaming computer and a comparable mainstream PC is the inclusion of a performance-oriented video card, which hosts a graphics processor and dedicated memory. These are generally a requirement to play modern games on the market. Forays into physics processing have also been made, though with Nvidia's buyout of PhysX and Intel's buyout of Havok, plans are that this functionality will be combined with existing CPU or GPU technologies. Custom-built gaming computers By 2012, it had become increasingly popular for gamers to custom-build their own PC, allowing for more budget control and easier upgradability. There are several components that must be considered when building a gaming computer, which include CPUs, memory, a motherboard, video cards, solid-state drives, power supplies, and cases. When building a custom-built gaming PC, builders usually turn to independent benchmarks to help make their hardware selection. Organizations such as AnandTech and Tom's Hardware Guide provide such benchmarks and hardware reviews. The benchmarks include ratings for PC components that are necessary to build a gaming computer. It is also crucial to consider computer cooling, as this is required to remove the waste heat produced by a computer's components. =Video cards (GPUs)= A video card (commonly referred to as a GPU) is an essential part to any gaming computer, and connects to a motherboard using the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI Express or PCI-E). There are two major manufacturers of GPUs for a gaming computer, AMD and NVIDIA. These companies provide GPUs which other companies, such as MSI and ASUS, then design circuit boards and cooling shrouds for. Most video cards cost between $200 and $2,000. Modern consumer-grade CPUs often have on- die integrated GPUs; however, these GPUs typically do not provide the adequate performance for playing graphics-intensive games, and are instead aimed primarily for less demanding workloads such as graphical user interface rendering for \\"everyday\\" tasks, video playback, and light gaming. =Processors (CPUs)= A major component of a gaming computer is the CPU (central processing unit), or simply processor. There are two major brands that manufacture CPUs, AMD and Intel. As of 2020, most gaming computers are built with Intel's Comet Lake or AMD's Zen 2 CPUs. While a powerful CPU is important to avoid bottlenecks, after a certain level of CPU power, diminishing returns become evident if the PC is not being used for other, more CPU-intensive purposes. =Motherboards= Motherboards that are designed for gaming computers are differentiated from their normal counterparts by being created with case windows in mind; having more visually appealing designs, sturdier materials, and, in some models, built-in LED lighting. They also have the capability to overclock certain models of CPUs, and an increased number of various connection ports. =Memory= Random-access memory (RAM) is one of the most important components for a gaming computer. Computers designed for playing games often are supplied with a high amount of RAM. Most gaming PCs have at least 8 GB of RAM. While 16 GB of RAM is often considered a sweet spot for gaming, 32 GB of RAM is increasingly used for future-proofing.  DDR memory  DDR (double data rate) memory is essential for any computer system. Adding more memory allows the CPU to address more data for it to quickly access instead of reading off a comparatively slow disk drive or solid-state storage device. DDR SDRAM also has much lower latency than its GDDR counterpart and much lower bandwidth as the CPU relies on being able to change small amounts of data quickly. The latest standard of DDR memory is DDR4L.  GDDR memory  GDDR (graphical double data rate) memory is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card and is built directly onto the card itself. The amount of RAM built onto a graphics card allows the GPU to quickly access data such as textures instead of reading from a much slower storage device. Having more GDDR memory allows the system to handle higher levels of spatial anti-aliasing and more complex textures. GDDR memory has a much higher latency when compared to DDR memory but also has a much larger bandwidth, thus allowing the GPU to deal with larger amounts of data at a slower rate when compared to a CPU. The latest revision of GDDR memory is GDDR6.  High bandwidth memory (HBM)  HBM is a type of memory required for the operation of any PCIe graphics card, and is placed directly beside the GPU itself on the graphics card. This is different from standard GDDR as standard GDDR memory sits on the PCB of the graphics card. The main advantages of having the memory mounted so close to the GPU itself are as follows; reduced latency due to signals traveling a shorter distance, more bandwidth due to more space for data lanes, and decreased power consumption due to inherent differences to GDDR on the microscopic level. The latest revision of HBM is HBM2. =Solid-state drives= Solid-state drives (SSD) are a newer form of data storage that is gaining in popularity. The more common and traditional hard disk drive (HDD) is still the more widely used, but many gaming enthusiasts are turning to SSDs in favor of the advantages they offer over HDDs. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, meaning they are less susceptible to shock and also run silently. SSDs also offer faster access time, as HDDs require time in order for the moving parts to speed up to operating specifications. An SSD can be 4 or 5 times faster than a traditional HDD. For an SSD, files open almost instantly. This means with an SSD, booting up a system and launching programs take less time. SSDs will increase the performance of a system by how often the game accesses the drive in order to load items from the game such as level files and texture images. However, SSDs cost much more than HDDs do per gigabyte, meaning in terms of pure capacity, they are not as cost-effective. They also currently offer a lower common maximum capacity than HDDs. Thus, it is common for a gaming computer to have an SSD for the operating system, applications and frequently used files, and one or more hard disk drives for larger, rarely-used files. =Power supply units= Although occasionally overlooked, the power supply unit (PSU) is still an important component to consider. The wattage needed to run a system is dependent on the hardware, so often a PSU calculator is used to determine the wattage needed. In addition, future upgrades to a gaming rig will possibly require more power, and PSUs lose power as they age, so it is often a good idea to buy a PSU that has the capability of lasting through several years and upgrades. The PSU must also be compatible with the other hardware pieces. There are two types of PSUs, modular PSUs (MPSU) and non-modular PSUs. Non- modular PSUs come with fixed cables, meaning unused ones will be left unconnected. Modular power supplies have cables that are detachable so unused cables do not create excess clutter but are often more expensive than their non-modular counterparts. Both fulfill the same purpose, but often Modular PSUs are preferred because they allow for better cable management, as they remove the issue of unused cable clutter that non-modular PSUs often have. Semi-modular power supplies come with only the necessary cables fixed, while cables that are not necessarily needed are able to be detached. =Cooling systems= Many gamers and computer enthusiasts choose to overclock their CPU(s) and GPU(s) in order to gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, air cooling and water cooling. Air cooling, the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with fans, heat pipes and/or vapor chambers to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation. Watercooling is available as either a ready-to-use system (aio coolers) or as kits that need to be assembled and can be customized for expanding cooling capacity, cooling additional components or for aesthetic reasons. =Case= Choosing a computer case involves several considerations. For one, there is a large range of sizes. A larger gaming tower will allow for future upgrades and more movement. The case must also be compatible with the motherboard's form factor. Because games are oftentimes demanding on a system, one of the most important factors of choosing a case is cooling. In order to avoid the risk of overheating hardware, a computer case with good airflow and a quality fan will go a long way in ensuring proper cooling. Other additional features such as fan speed controllers, filters for dust management, and clear side panels are all useful as well. Custom-building allows a builder to personalize their case if they so desire for aesthetic purposes. There are many designs for computer cases so the builder can choose to their liking. Pre-built computers Pre-built gaming computer showing the case lighting used for the rig While custom-built PCs tend to be more advanced and powerful, some choose to go with pre-built or custom-built gaming PCs. These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service. Different companies offer varying degrees of customization. While established gaming computers such as Alienware or CyberPowerPC offer unique case designs and little customization from the user prior to purchase, other smaller firms allow a greater degree of customization and better value-for-money, often to the same extent as if the user were to build the computer themselves. There are, however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it is in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover the entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufacturers. Due to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufacturers, trying to get support can be a daunting task. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building a PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or maybe as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.Build Your Own PC. PCMech. Retrieved on 2012-06-11. One major drawback of buying a prebuilt gaming PC aside from the extra cost is that they are often built with a very powerful CPU, but with a relatively weak graphics card. This results in a \\"gaming\\" PC that performs poorly in gaming for the price paid. Most games today do not benefit much from having a very powerful CPU with more than 4 CPU cores and hyper-threading,CPU Cores for Gaming: How many do you need? - Q1 2015 Update but benefits greatly with a more powerful graphics card. Gaming laptop computers Gaming laptops such as MSI, Acer, Asus are the mobile equivalent of gaming desktops and are usually more expensive than their desktop counterparts. Currently, most gaming laptops like MSI, Acer, Asus feature more power-efficient versions of high-end desktop graphics cards, which nevertheless still significantly drain the battery, and necessitate more advanced systems. One recent development by Nvidia is SLI for laptops. Generally, gaming laptops are not considered \\"rigs\\" as the term can also refer to the physical size of the system. Modern gaming laptops can achieve respectable game performance, but never quite match desktops in a class to class comparison, and most do not feature upgradeable graphics cards. Due to the relatively small size that the hardware has to fit in, cooling the heat-intensive components is a major problem affecting the performance of such laptops, usually causing degraded value for money performance-wise. Attempts at using the same performance hardware as desktops usually end in a decreased clock frequency of graphics chips to reduce heat, causing the poor value for money. The introduction of the Nvidia GTX 900M series of mobile GPUs in late 2014 represented a significant advancement from the previous 800M series, lessening the gap with desktop systems and making gaming laptops a more viable alternative to desktop PCs. A newer approach in the gaming PC industry is to create small form factor desktops, which are more compact and easier to transport than a normal full-sized system.

A pitch angle of 0 degrees is a particle whose parallel motion is perfectly along the local magnetic field. In the northern hemisphere this particle would be heading down toward the Earth (and the opposite in the southern hemisphere). A pitch angle of 90 degrees is a particle that is locally mirroring (see: Magnetosphere particle motion). Special case: equatorial pitch angle The equatorial pitch angle of a particle is the pitch angle of the particle at the Earth's geomagnetic equator. This angle defines the loss cone of a particle.

Retrieved: May 4, 2012. It is the only all-new light aircraft that was designed and entered series production in the United States in the mid-to-late 1980s. Development Design work by Christen Industries began in 1985. The aircraft is one of the few in its class designed with the benefit of CAD software. The prototype first flew in 1986, and certification was awarded the following year. With more than 650 aircraft sold between its introduction and 2008, the Husky was one of the best-selling light aircraft designs of the period. Design The Husky features a braced high wing, tandem seating and dual controls. The structure is steel tube frames and Dacron covering over all but the rear of the fuselage, plus metal leading edges on the wings. The high wing was selected for good all-around visibility, making the Husky ideal for observation and patrol roles. Power is supplied by a relatively powerful (for the Husky's weight) Textron Lycoming O-360 flat- four piston engine turning a constant speed propeller. In 2015 a reversible MT Propeller was approved under a Supplementary Type Certificate for better control during floatplane water operations. The Husky's high power-to-weight ratio and low wing loading result in good short-field performance. Options include floats, skis and banner and glider tow hooks. Operational history The Husky has been used for observation duties, fisheries patrol, pipeline inspection, glider towing, border patrol and other utility missions. Notable users include the US Department of the Interior and Agriculture and the Kenya Wildlife Service, which flies seven on aerial patrols of elephant herds as part of the fight against illegal ivory poaching.

There are no winners or losers in the Portland event Chicago, Illinois Chicago's Urban Iditarod, called the Chiditarod, has been held annually on the first Saturday in March since 2006. Historically the race has occurred in and around the Chicago neighborhood of West Town. Much like other Urban Iditarods, a Chiditarod team includes 5 participants: 4 dawgs and a musher. Teams are required to use a regular shopping cart and are not allowed to modify the cart's original caster wheels. Beyond this limitation, teams are encouraged to take artistic liberties with their carts and participants often decorate their carts in highly creative ways and dress in costume to match their team's theme. Like a traditional race, teams compete to finish the course in as little time as possible, while making designated stops at checkpoints along the course. Participating teams are allowed and even encouraged to sabotage each other in order to gain advantage but most teams engage in sabotage merely for bragging rights. In the spirit of radical inclusion, the Chiditarod organizers hand out a number of awards in a variety of categories giving participants the freedom to compete in the fields they are best suited for. The landmark of the Chiditarod is the event's charitable aspect. Billing itself as \\"Probably the world's largest mobile food drive,\\" the Chiditarod plays an important role in helping raise foods for Chicago's food depositories, where in teams were asked to donate a minimum amount of high protein, non perishable food items. Racers also raise funds to help solve hunger issues with all funds directed to community grants programs that are finding new ways to solve food insecurities. Another notable innovation is the organization's approach to self-policing. In an effort to keep all participants safe throughout the course, the Chiditarod deploys bike marshals who act as roaming course deputies: resolving disputes between teams, mitigating destructive sabotage, safeguarding participant conduct, and lending a helping hand when necessary. Trademark claim In 2014, the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race sent a cease-and-desist order to Idiotarod NYC, asserting that the name \\"Idiotarod\\" infringed its trademark in \\"Iditarod.\\" Idiotarod NYC characterized the letter as \\"frivolous threats of legal action\\", but renamed the event to \\"Idiotarodorama NYC (aka 'The Desistarod')\\".

Such was the popular acclaim that the BBC repeated it on Radio 4 the following Saturday afternoon. It began life as the fourth and final play in the God's Country series of linked radio dramas broadcast in 1997 on BBC Radio 4. However, due to its success (it went on to sell thousands of copies on cassette) it has come to overshadow the other plays in the sequence somewhat, and is commonly thought of as a standalone piece. Spoken by a 7 year old autistic girl who is dying from cancer, the original recording was performed by Becky Simpson who won two awards for her performance http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/report1998/highligh/awards/award.htm The play was subsequently published as part of the anthology Spoonface Steinberg and Other Plays in October 1997. On 30 March 1998 the play was rebroadcast, this time on BBC TV and with images (including that of Ella Jones as Spoonface) added to the original. A stage version, adapted by Hall himself as well the play's directors Marcello Magni and Annie Castledine, was first performed in 2000. The play featured Kathryn Hunter, at the time 42 years of age, in the title role. The Scottish professional premiere was produced by Nomad at the Tron Theatre in 2002. Kirstin McLean played Spoonface and Mark Westbrook directed. The play has also been produced by the Nuffield Theatre Southampton, directed by Russ Tunney, starring Julie Rose Smith as Spoonface. Beggars and Kings' production directed by Michael Fentiman was performed at Theatre Clwyd 26 March 2009, starring Zoe Thorne and toured until 30 April 2009. A production by the Freerange Theatre Company, directed by Hugo Chandor and starring Rebecca Fenwick, toured the north of England and Scotland in 2013, gaining nominations for best production and best actress at the Buxton Festival fringe.http://www.buxtonfringe.org.uk/awards2013.html together with a nomination for Best Fringe Performance at the Manchester Theatre Awards.

In the world  = Japan = Ebi furai is a deep fried dish popular in Japan as well as Japanese restaurants worldwide. It is a speciality of the city of Nagoya. A popular ingredient of Japanese bento, is a common menu item at bent≈ç shops. Traditionally Kuruma Ebi was used, but since a decline in its cultivation, many stores have started using black tiger shrimp and Ise Ebi. It is thought that ebi furai was created around 1900 in response to the growing popularity of similar dishes such as Tonkatsu and minced meat cutlets in the Western food restaurants of Ginza and Tokyo. Each prawn is straightened out flat, and a small incision made along its back. The gritty tasting digestive tract is then pulled out of this incision. The prawn is then coated with flour, beaten egg and Japanese breadcrumbs Panko in that order, and deep-fried in hot cooking oil. The head is usually removed before cooking. However, if the prawn is fresh enough, it may be cooked and served whole. Some people prefer to eat the head, which becomes crispy. Fried prawns are often eaten with a choice of thick Worcester sauce, Hoisin sauce, lemon juice or tartare sauce. * Ebi-don (Êµ∑ËÄÅ‰∏º or „Ç®„Éì‰∏º, fried prawn and egg over rice) - the prawns are brushed with egg only, and placed on top of a bowl of hot rice. Ebi furai is acknowledged as one of Nagoya's specialty foods mainly due to a joke made by the popular Japanese tarento (celebrity) Tamori about ebi furai being called ebi furyaa in the Nagoya dialect. Whilst this term did not exist in the Nagoya dialect prior to his joke, as foreign loan words generally do not change in Japanese dialects, it led a large portion of his audiences to believe that this was an extant variant used in the Nagoya area.„Å°„Çá„Å£„Å®„Åª„ÇçËã¶„ÅÑ!?Êµ∑ËÄÅ„Åµ„Çä„ÇÉ„ÅÇ = Korea = Saeu-twigim (fried shrimps) on a sokuri In Korean cuisine, fried shrimp is known as saeu-twigim ().

It is also a common anju (food accompanying alcoholic drinks) for beer. = Philippines = Okoy made from small unshelled shrimp Fried shrimp dishes in Philippine cuisine include camaron rebosado (battered shrimp), okoy (battered shrimp pancakes), halabos na hipon (fried or boiled shrimp cooked in its own juices or carbonated soda), and nilasing na hipon (battered shrimp marinated in alcohol), among others. Camaron rebosado is a deep-fried battered shrimp typically served with sweet and sour sauce. It is made by peeling large shrimp and marinating it in a mixture of calamansi juice, salt, and black pepper. It is then coated with a batter made from egg, flour, and corn starch before deep frying. Okoy is another native Filipino deep-fried dish that typically use small unshelled shrimp. The batter is uniquely traditionally made from galapong (ground soaked glutinous rice), mixed with calabaza, sweet potatoes, or cassava and various vegetables like carrots, onions, and green papaya. It is deep-fried into flat crispy pancakes and traditionally served with a vinegar-based dipping sauce.

Some of his major league career highlights include the 369 bases he stole over 14 years in the Major Leagues with the Dodgers, Kansas City Royals, Texas Rangers, Colorado Rockies, San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs, a career high 66 stolen bases with the Royals in , and a .290 batting average with the Rangers in . Tom had an interesting year when it came to home runs in ‚Äînot because he hit so many, but because of what kind of home runs they were. One of his six home runs occurred on April 5, was an inside-the-parker against the Braves. On April 30 against the Mets, he hit a grand slam, and on July 17 against the Athletics, he hit another grand slam. His career statistics draw comparisons to those of Billy North, a former Oakland Athletic. He last played major league baseball in , but he played in the independent Atlantic League in for the Atlantic City Surf. In a 14 year major league career covering 1288 games, Goodwin posted a .268 batting average (1029-for-3846) with 636 runs, 125 doubles, 39 triples, 24 home runs, 284 RBI, 369 stolen bases, 365 bases on balls, .332 on-base percentage and .339 slugging percentage. He recorded a .991 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In 21 postseason games, he hit .160 (4-for-25) with 1 run and 2 RBI. Post playing career After retiring as a player, Goodwin managed the Lewisville Lizards, coached for the Lowell Spinners, a minor league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, and served as a roving outfield and base running coach in the Red Sox minor league system. On October 29, 2011 Goodwin was named the first base coach for the Mets replacing former coach Mookie Wilson. On November 2, 2017, Goodwin returned to the Red Sox' organization as MLB first base coach on the staff of new manager Alex Cora. He effectively switched jobs with Rub√©n Amaro Jr., who moved from the Red Sox to the Mets. Goodwin with the Mets in 2012.

The album was released in June 1976 by Sire Records. The title Shake Some Action originates from a line in the 1965 film None but the Brave. Background and recording Shake Some Action was the first album by the newly reconstituted version of the Flamin' Groovies, who had returned from a five-year hiatus during which lead singer Roy Loney departed the band, leaving guitarist Cyril Jordan as its de facto leader. During that period, the Groovies had released three singles, all recorded in 1972 while the band was living in the UK, under contract to United Artists Records, and being produced by Dave Edmunds.Jordan, Cyril. Liner notes to Slow Death (2002). Retrieved 5 December 2017. Two of the songs from those sessions (the title track and \\"You Tore Me Down\\") eventually ended up on this album. The band drastically reshaped their musical style, stripping down the blues and rockabilly influences of their previous work in favor of a more retro, guitar-oriented power pop style emulating that of the 1960s British Invasion scene. The new band took to wearing velvet-collared three-piece suits and Cuban heels in an attempt to recreate the fashion sense of the era. In an interview with ZigZag magazine, Jordan stated that the band \\"just wanted to get back to the flash of that era, which were the best years, as far as I'm concerned.\\" Release and reception In a contemporary review of Shake Some Action, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that the Flamin' Groovies, without Roy Loney and having remodelled themselves as \\"an English pop-revival band\\", now \\"get their kicks playing dumb\\", and that while the album contained good songs, \\"only cultists will ever hear them.\\" In the United States, Shake Some Action reached number 142 on the Billboard albums chart. The album was released to a much greater reception in the United Kingdom, then in the early stages of the punk era. Newly based in England, the reformed Flamin' Groovies found itself aligned with the burgeoning punk scene, along with the likes of bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. Retrospectively, Ian S. Port of San Francisco Weekly states that Shake Some Action \\"influenced the rise of power pop and punk in America, and remains a vital document of that era.\\" In a retrospective review of the album, Mark Deming of AllMusic opined that \\"if Shake Some Action was the first salvo from the new and improved Flamin' Groovies, it also demonstrated that this edition of the band had as much promise as the Loney- fronted group,\\" calling the title track \\"a brilliant evocation of the adventurous side of British rock circa 1966 ... [which] by its lonesome served as a superb justification for The Groovies' new creative direction.\\" Joe Tangari of Pitchfork wrote that Shake Some Action \\"is in every sense both a comeback and a re-invention, and it's been rightly championed by collectors and critics extolling its effortless pop perfection.\\" In 2014, the title track was one of the ten selected by Greil Marcus for his book The History of Rock 'n' Roll in Ten Songs: Track listing Personnel * Cyril Jordan - guitar, vocals * Chris Wilson - vocals, guitar * James Ferrell - guitar * George Alexander - bass * David Wright - drums * Danny Mihm - drums on 1, 5 Cover versions The title song was covered by David Lowery for the soundtrack to the 1995 film Clueless.

Development Polarity was invented in 1985 by Canadian artist and designer Douglas Seaton. It was first published in 1986. The game has had a tumultuous past, with its rights changing hands several times over the past two decades. The game has been published by Telemotion Technologies, Irwin Toy, briefly with Mattel and most recently by Temple Games. The game ships in a canvas sleeve and include the magnets, the board, and a paper rulebook. An unrelated game of the same name is published by a company called Mindwalk (Company). Gameplay The purpose of the game is to gain points by forming towers of discs. The playing pieces are magnetic discs, with one side white and the other black, north and south respectively. They are identical with the exception of a neutral central disc which is coloured red. Play starts with one player tossing the central red disc in order to determine which player plays with which colour/magnetic polarity. Each player then lays 5 'foundation discs' of their colour starting with the white player. Each disc can be placed on the playing area with no limitation other than to be inside the external circle and not touching the red disc. Two leaners that have been played off a tower Play then proceeds by placing further discs within the playing area, balanced, leaning, on the magnetic fields of preceding pieces. These pieces are known as 'leaners'. Moves which disrupt the pieces currently in play by making them fall or stick together are known as 'faults', and end a player's turn. If a fault results in two or more pieces touching each other, the opposing player then has an opportunity to capture those pieces by forming them into towers, which at the end of the game score points. Occasionally a player will intentionally fault, causing one of their own pieces to fall flat onto the play surface, thus making it easier to play further pieces. The play ends when one player has exhausted their supply of pieces or if a piece touches the center red disc. The winner of the game is determined by points scored, which are based on the number of pieces in towers of a player's color, and the pieces remaining in the opponent's hand. Reception Polarity won the 2005 Origins Award for one of the Vanguard Innovative Game Awards.

He is currently the lead singer of Manfred Mann's Earth Band and the band Diesel. He has performed as a solo artist, and with The Distance and also with former Whitesnake members in the band called Company of Snakes and with Bad Company. He also fronted The Jones Gang, a rock group formed by Hart, Rick Wills and Kenney Jones. He now performs as a solo artist as well as touring with his own band XBad Company, with Dave \\"Bucket\\" Colwell and Garry \\"Harry\\" James (ex-members of Bad Company). He was the first English writer to be signed to Disney owned Hollywood Records. He has also written several Number 1 hits, and written a number of songs for film soundtracks, whilst being signed to Roy Orbison's Still Working Music, Disney's Hollywood Records, and Island Records. Career Chris Blackwell signed Hart to his Island Records label in the 1980s and teamed him with Bernard Edwards. The two men produced collaborated on several projects, including the soundtrack for the Whoopi Goldberg film, The Burglar. The Distance was commercially successful in Japan. After leaving the band Hart moved to Atlantic Records as a solo artist, with Stewart Levine producing his first album, Cries and Whispers. He then became the first English artist to be signed by Disney-owned Hollywood Records, and worked with Russ Ballard on Hart's self-titled album, Robert Hart, which charted in more than 18 countries. While touring following the release of the album in 1992, Hart was approached by Mick Ralphs of Bad Company and asked whether he would be interested in fronting the band. For the next seven years Hart toured with them. He also co-wrote two of the band's albums, Company of Strangers and Stories Told & Untold, three live albums. Over the years Hart has also been involved in projects with Andy Taylor of Duran Duran, Peter Maffay, members of Chic and Go West. His association with Kenney Jones came via Boz Burrell, who played with Hart in Bad Company. =Bad Company= During 1992, Hart was approached by Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirke and asked if he would like to join them as the third lead vocalist for Bad Company, following Paul Rodgers and Brian Howe. Hart performed with Bad Company, including in the USA and Canada. In July 1994 a contract was drawn up by Alliance Artists and Legend Management and signed by the then Bad Company line up, Mick Ralphs, Simon Kirke, Hart, Dave Colwell and Rick Wills, giving Hart the right to perform, write and record songs and albums and receive royalty payments as a full Bad Company member. In 1995 a self-produced Bad Company album was released, Company of Strangers, with Hart, who bore a vocal similarity to Paul Rodgers. It contained five tracks self-penned or co-written by Hart and Ralphs. The band made a promotional tour of the USA with Bon Jovi. Griffin Music of America also re-issued Take This! on compact disc. In 1996 another Bad Co album, Stories Told & Untold featured Hart. Stories Told & Untold, contained seven new compositions and seven acoustic versions including 'Can't Get Enough' and 'Ready For Love'. Hart was also lead vocalist on three live albums between 1994 and 2001. In March he will be on tour in Germany with ‚ÄúRock meets classic‚Äú featuring Alice Cooper. =The Jones Gang= After Bad Company, Hart became the frontman with the Jones Gang. Hart formed the trio with Kenney Jones in 2001. Hart wrote a charity song titled \\"It's All About The Children\\" for which Hart and Jones and other artists played on the record. They included: Paul Young, Gary Granger, Ronnie Wood, and Rick Wills. The band recorded an album titled Any Day Now which Hart co-wrote all of the tracks and sole wrote most of the tracks. The album was released in the U.S on 9 August 2005. The debut single \\"Angel\\" written by Hart, and Russ Ballard went to number 1 on the ACQB Top 40 charts, staying there for a further 11 weeks. The album overall was commercially successful and another two songs by Hart reached the top ten of Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Sales Chart . The airline company USA 3000 commissioned 14 planes to have The Jones Gang album cover art work on as drawn by Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones. These planes were the first sent in the rescue operation of people affected by Hurricane Wilma. =Manfred Mann's Earth Band= On 13 March 2011, Manfred Mann announced Hart as the new singer for his formation Manfred Mann's Earth Band. =XBad Company= Hart had played with Dave \\"Bucket\\" Colwell and Gary \\"Harry\\" James over many years with Bad Company and, in Colwell's case, also the Jones Gang. They have all worked together on various albums, co-written songs and have toured the world together, and in 2009 they formed the band XBad Company. They recorded a FIFA World Cup song called \\"We Ain't Going Home Empty Handed\\". =Help for Heroes= Hart gave permission for his song \\"We Will Remember Them\\" to be recorded by various artists for the charity Help for Heroes. On 1 November 2009, Robin Gibb, Michael Bolton, Mica Paris, Paul Rodgers and Lee Mead, who won TV's Any Dream Will Do and others recorded it at Abbey Road Studios in London.

It operates Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports from RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for service during World War II, operating Short Empire flying boats and a variety of smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with Douglas C-47 Dakota transports, which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946. The unit was re-established in February 1981 as a flight, equipped with two Boeing 707s for VIP and other long-range transport duties out of RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. No. 33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No. 33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011, and achieved initial operating capability with the type in February 2013. One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. Role and equipment Crew member giving a safety brief aboard a No. 33 Squadron Airbus KC-30, February 2013 No. 33 Squadron is responsible for aerial refuelling and long-range transport. It is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No. 86 Wing, which is part of Air Mobility Group. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular aircraft service. Heavier maintenance is conducted by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defence Services (formerly Qantas Defence Services). The squadron operates six Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, the first of which entered service in June 2011. A seventh, for VIP passenger transport as well as aerial refuelling, is due for delivery in 2019. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise. The KC-30 can carry up to 100 tonnes of fuel. Its dual delivery systems‚Äîprobe-and-drogue in the wings and boom under the tail‚Äîare designed to refuel the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet multi-role fighters, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III heavy airlifters, Boeing E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft, or other KC-30s. The tanker is also capable of refuelling future acquisitions including the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter, the Boeing EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, and the Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. In its transport configuration, the KC-30 can carry 270 passengers or 40 tonnes of cargo. As well as its aircraft, No. 33 Squadron operates a simulator at Amberley. History =World War II= No. 33 Squadron de Havilland Dragon at alt=Military personnel and a jeep in front of a twin-engined biplane, with jungle and a mountain range in the background During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos. 33, 34, 35 and 36 Squadrons. No. 33 Squadron was established on 16 February at Townsville, Queensland, under the control of North-Eastern Area Command. Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 481 RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 35‚Äì38 It was equipped with four ex-Qantas Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron, along with several smaller types including de Havilland Dragons and Tiger Moths, Avro Ansons, and Vultee Vigilants.Eather, Flying Squadrons, pp. 68‚Äì69 The squadron suffered its first loss on 27 February, when one of the Empires crashed on landing at Townsville; the six crew members were killed. A second Empire was destroyed at its mooring during a Japanese air attack on Broome, Western Australia, on 3 March; another Empire was impressed from Qantas to replace the lost aircraft. Two months later the commanding officer, Squadron Leader Charles Gurney, was killed while co-piloting a Martin B-26 Marauder of the 19th Bomb Squadron USAAFHickey \\"Revenge of the Red Raiders\\" pp. 495, 600 that crashed after attacking Rabaul.Gamble, Fortress Rabaul, pp. 157‚Äì158Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 605n One of No. 33 Squadron's tasks was search-and- rescue; it lost another Empire on 8 August 1942, when it sank in heavy seas off the coast of New Guinea while trying to rescue survivors of a torpedoed ship. No. 33 Squadron transferred to Port Moresby in January 1943, providing air transport to Australian forces involved in the New Guinea campaign. Transport needs were so desperate in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were employed, delivering a total of per trip. In September‚ÄìOctober 1943, the squadron began taking delivery of fifteen Douglas C-47 Dakotas to replace its assortment of aircraft. By the time it transferred to Milne Bay on 1 January 1944, it was operating Dakotas exclusively, and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The squadron relocated to Lae on 15 January 1945. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, it was tasked with repatriating service personnel and former prisoners of war. No. 33 Squadron returned to Townsville on 11 March 1946, and disbanded there on 13 May. =Post-war re- establishment= In 1978, the Australian government decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it saw as the risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 38‚Äì40 Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, pp. 107‚Äì108 The first was transferred to the RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22 April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No. 37 Squadron. They were formed into No. 33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2 February 1981. The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter. US Navy Hornet during the war in Afghanistan, April 2002alt=Air-to-air view of four-engined jet transport refuelling fighter plane On 1 July 1983, after the government procured two more 707s for $7.5 million from Worldways Canada, No. 33 Flight was reorganised as No. 33 Squadron under Grierson's command. Responsible for transporting VIPs such as members of the British Royal Family, the Governor- General, the Prime Minister, and the Pope, the 707 also became the first RAAF aircraft to land in the Soviet Union, the occasion being the funeral of Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. Along with Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons, operating Lockheed C-130 Hercules, No. 33 Squadron came under the control of No. 86 Wing, part of the newly established Air Lift Group (later Air Mobility Group), in February 1987. Routine servicing of the 707s and Hercules was the responsibility of No. 486 Squadron, another component of No. 86 Wing.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 70‚Äì71 Qantas undertook heavier maintenance of the 707s at its jet base in Mascot. The RAAF acquired three more 707s on 25 February 1988, following a $25 million purchase from Boeing Military. One of the airframes was non-flying, for spares only, and was nicknamed \\"Hulksbury\\". A consortium of Israel Aerospace Industries and Hawker de Havilland converted four of No. 33 Squadron's six serviceable aircraft to in-flight refuelling tankers between December 1988 and May 1992. Their probe- and-drogue configuration allowed them to refuel the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets and the Royal New Zealand Air Force's Douglas A-4K Skyhawks, but not the RAAF's General Dynamics F-111 bombers, which required a boom system; the other two 707s continued to be used purely for long-range transport. The RAAF had argued for an air-to-air refuelling capability for both the and the , but the Australian government refused to fund the latter, considering the F-111's existing range sufficient for deterrent purposes. Observers such as journalist Frank Cranston speculated that aside from any cost issues, the government was concerned that extending the bombers' range would signal to the region that Australia was adopting a more aggressive defence posture.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 178‚Äì180Stephens, Power Plus Attitude, p. 178 RIAT, 2006 In April 1989, one of the 707s transported 300 Australian Army personnel in two flights to Namibia as part of the Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines. On 29 October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time.State Coroner Victoria Report Case Nos. 3587, 3589, 3612, 3601, 3732/91 No. 33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993. In January 1998, still based at Richmond, No. 33 Squadron joined Nos. 32 and 34 Squadrons under No. 84 Wing.Odgers, Air Force Australia, p. 206 Two of No. 33 Squadron's aircraft were soon employed to form No. 84 Wing Detachment A in Kuwait, as part of Operation Southern Watch. On 5 March, one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron's re-formation in 1983, when it refuelled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force (RAF) over Saudi Arabia. The detachment subsequently refuelled US F/A-18 Hornets, Northrop Grumman EA-6 Prowlers and McDonnell Douglas AV-8 Harriers, and RAF British Aerospace Harriers, as well as the Tornados. From March to September 2002, two 707s formed No. 84 Wing Detachment as part of Australia's contribution to the war in Afghanistan. Located at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre, their efforts earning No. 84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation. =Re-equipment= No. 33 Squadron Airbus KC-30 on a exercise in Guam, February 2013 By the mid-1990s, the ageing 707s carrying Australian VIPs overseas were no longer compliant with foreign noise and emission regulations. No. 33 Squadron relinquished its VIP transport role in 2002, following the entry into service of No. 34 Squadron's Boeing 737 Business Jets and Bombardier Challenger 604s. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in May 2007, \\"in recognition of its high levels of proficiency demonstrated over the year\\" in spite of the challenges of operating the obsolescent 707s, and for having \\"performed superbly on a number of high-profile missions\\". The 707s were retired in 2008, bringing to an end the 29-year operational history of the type in the RAAF. The last one in service, an ex-Qantas jet named \\"Richmond Town\\", made a low-level farewell flight over Sydney on 30 June in the company of smaller aircraft filming the occasion, which gave rise to fear in some quarters that a 9/11-style terrorist attack was in progress. Three 707s remained at Richmond until 2011, when they were flown out by their new operator, the US-based Omega Air Services; Omega also procured the RAAF's Boeing simulator, which had been operated by No. 285 Squadron. Following the retirement of the Boeing 707, No. 33 Squadron relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1 July 2008. It was presented with a Squadron Standard by Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley on 2 June 2010, to commemorate \\"25 years of faithful and outstanding service\\". Having been without aircraft for three years, the squadron began re-equipping with the first of five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports on 1 June 2011. The KC-30 could carry one-and-a- half times as much fuel as the 707 and was configured with both probe-and- drogue and boom delivery systems. These aircraft had originally been scheduled to enter service late in 2008, and the RAAF had to lease tankers from the United States Air Force and Omega Air to meet its aerial refuelling needs while Airbus rectified problems with the boom system and completed essential technical documentation. In March 2012, one of the KC-30s set a record for the number of passengers carried on an RAAF aircraft, 220 cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy. No. 33 Squadron KC-30 prior to a joint operation over the Middle East with a USAF McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender, 2016 The squadron received its fifth KC-30 on 3 December 2012, and achieved initial operating capability in February 2013. It expected to reach final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14 September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as part of a coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1 October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13 May 2015.

The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No. 33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy. The unit's sixth KC-30 was delivered to Amberley in September 2017 and the seventh in 2019. This aircraft has a VIP passenger-carrying capability augmenting its aerial refuelling role. The VIP aircraft is fitted with first class and business class seats as well as a conference room. In December 2018 Wing Commander Sarah Stalker assumed command of No. 33 Squadron, becoming the first woman appointed to lead a RAAF flying squadron in over a decade.

Tension could be the opposite of compression. At the atomic level, when atoms or molecules are pulled apart from each other and gain potential energy with a restoring force still existing, the restoring force might create what is also called tension. Each end of a string or rod under such tension could pull on the object it is attached to, in order to restore the string/rod to its relaxed length. In physics, tension, as a transmitted force, as an action-reaction pair of forces, or as a restoring force, may be a force and has the units of force measured in newtons (or sometimes pounds-force). The ends of a string or other object transmitting tension will exert forces on the objects to which the string or rod is connected, in the direction of the string at the point of attachment. These forces due to tension are also called \\"passive forces\\". There are two basic possibilities for systems of objects held by strings:Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, Section 5.7. Seventh Edition, Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning, 2008. either acceleration is zero and the system is therefore in equilibrium, or there is acceleration, and therefore a net force is present in the system. 9 men at the Irish champion tug of war team pull on a rope. The rope in the photo extends into a drawn illustration showing adjacent segments of the rope. One segment is duplicated in a free body diagram showing a pair of action-reaction forces of magnitude T pulling the segment in opposite directions, where T is transmitted axially and is called the tension force. This end of the rope is pulling the tug of war team to the right. Each segment of the rope is pulled apart by the two neighboring segments, stressing the segment in what is also called tension, which can change along the too football fields members. Tension in one dimension The tension in a tetherball rope. Tension in a string is a scalar quantity (i.e. non-negative). Zero tension is slack. A string or rope is often idealized as one dimension, having length but being massless with zero cross section. If there are no bends in the string, as occur with vibrations or pulleys, then tension is a constant along the string, equal to the magnitude of the forces applied by the ends of the string. By Newton's third law, these are the same forces exerted on the ends of the string by the objects to which the ends are attached. If the string curves around one or more pulleys, it will still have constant tension along its length in the idealized situation that the pulleys are massless and frictionless. A vibrating string vibrates with a set of frequencies that depend on the string's tension. These frequencies can be derived from Newton's laws of motion. Each microscopic segment of the string pulls on and is pulled upon by its neighboring segments, with a force equal to the tension at that position along the string. If the string has curvature, then the two pulls on a segment by its two neighbors will not add to zero, and there will be a net force on that segment of the string, causing an acceleration. This net force is a restoring force, and the motion of the string can include transverse waves that solve the equation central to Sturm‚ÄìLiouville theory: :\\\\- \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\bigg[ \\\\tau(x) \\\\frac{d\\\\rho(x)}{dx} \\\\bigg]+v(x)\\\\rho(x) = \\\\omega^2\\\\sigma(x)\\\\rho(x) where v(x) is the force constant per unit length [units force per area] and \\\\omega^2 are the eigenvalues for resonances of transverse displacement \\\\rho(x) on the string,A. Fetter and J. Walecka. (1980). Theoretical Mechanics of Particles and Continua. New York: McGraw-Hill. with solutions that include the various harmonics on a stringed instrument. Tension in three dimensions Tension is also used to describe the force exerted by the ends of a three-dimensional, continuous material such as a rod or truss member. Such a rod elongates under tension. The amount of elongation and the load that will cause failure both depend on the force per cross-sectional area rather than the force alone, so stress = axial force / cross sectional area is more useful for engineering purposes than tension. Stress is a 3x3 matrix called a tensor, and the \\\\sigma_{11} element of the stress tensor is tensile force per area, or compression force per area, denoted as a negative number for this element, if the rod is being compressed rather than elongated. Thus, one can obtain a scalar analogous to tension by taking the trace of the stress tensor. System in equilibrium A system is in equilibrium when the sum of all forces is zero. :\\\\sum_ {} \\\\vec{F} = 0 For example, consider a system consisting of an object that is being lowered vertically by a string with tension, T, at a constant velocity. The system has a constant velocity and is therefore in equilibrium because the tension in the string, which is pulling up on the object, is equal to the weight force, mg (\\"m\\" is mass, \\"g\\" is the acceleration caused by the gravity of Earth), which is pulling down on the object. :\\\\sum_ {} \\\\vec{F} = \\\\vec{T} + m\\\\vec{g} = 0 System under net force A system has a net force when an unbalanced force is exerted on it, in other words the sum of all forces is not zero. Acceleration and net force always exist together. :\\\\sum_ {} \\\\vec{F} e 0 For example, consider the same system as above but suppose the object is now being lowered with an increasing velocity downwards (positive acceleration) therefore there exists a net force somewhere in the system. In this case, negative acceleration would indicate that mg > T. :\\\\sum \\\\vec{F} = \\\\vec{T} - m\\\\vec{g} e 0 In another example, suppose that two bodies A and B having masses m_1 and m_2, respectively, are connected with each other by an inextensible string over a frictionless pulley. There are two forces acting on the body A: its weight (w_1=m_1g) pulling down, and the tension T in the string pulling up. Therefore, the net force F_1 on body A is w_1-T, so m_1a=m_1g-T. In an extensible string, Hooke's law applies. Strings in modern physics String-like objects in relativistic theories, such as the strings used in some models of interactions between quarks, or those used in the modern string theory, also possess tension. These strings are analyzed in terms of their world sheet, and the energy is then typically proportional to the length of the string. As a result, the tension in such strings is independent of the amount of stretching.

He played college football at UCF and was also the head coach for the Jacksonville Sharks of the National Arena League (NAL) from 2017 to 2019. High school years Burley attended Westwood High School in Mesa and was a letterman in football, basketball, and track. In football, as a senior, he was an All-City and an All-State selection as a wide receiver and as a defensive back. College career Before Burley transferred from Mesa Community College to the University of Central Florida where he played football, he played in the Arizona Football League. While at UCF, he led the team in receiving for two straight years. He also led the team in punt returns. His college quarterback was National Football League quarterback Daunte Culpepper. Professional career In 2001 and 2002, Burley spent his first two AFL seasons with the Orlando Predators. Following the 2001 season, he was named to the AFL All-Rookie team. In 2003, Burley played just one season for the Los Angeles Avengers recording nine touchdowns. In 2004 and 2005, Burley played for the Arizona Rattlers for two seasons. In 2005, the Arena Football League‚Äôs Writers Association named Burley the Offensive Player of the Year. He set a franchise record with 45 touchdown receptions for the season and was named to the All-Arena Second Team. In 2006, Burley played for the Utah Blaze where he started all 16 games. He ended the season ranked first in the league with an average of 120.9 receiving yards per game and second in the league for touchdown catches (44) and average receptions per game (8.5). He set expansion team records in total receiving yards (1,934), receptions (136) and receiving touchdowns (44). He was also named to the All-Arena Second Team for the second consecutive year. In 2007, Burley had a record-setting year with the Blaze, breaking league records for receptions (166) and receiving yards (2,129) and was named Offensive Player of the Year for the second time in his career. He also finished second in the league with 49 touchdown receptions and averaged 12.8 yards per catch. He averaged 24.6 yards on kickoff returns.

Buckham is a former chief of staff of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, and the firm openly promoted its access to DeLay. Its chief lobbyist was Paul Behrends, who became Dana Rohrabacher's aide. In January 2006 the firm was shut down. Buckham said that it was fatally damaged by publicity about the ongoing federal investigation into the actions of convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff.  Clients  In 2004 the firm had US$8.8 million in revenues, with prominent clients such as Amgen, BellSouth, Eli Lilly and Company, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, R.J. Reynolds, Koch Industries, Microsoft, Time Warner, Enron, and the United Parcel Service. Other notable clients included Blackwater Security Services, the employer of the contractors killed in Fallujah, Iraq in 2004, and PerfectWave, the defense contracting firm owned by Brent R. Wilkes, under investigation for bribing Duke Cunningham. = Connections to Abramoff= The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians were clients of the firm at the same time that they employed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. ASG was paid more than $1 million by the U.S. Family Network, a nonprofit organization that Buckham helped create in 1996 while he was still working for DeLay. The non-profit's total revenue during its existence (it closed in 2001) was $3.02 million, most of which came from clients of Jack Abramoff. = Connections to the Heritage Foundation and the Government of Malaysia = From August 30 to September 4, 2001, Buckham joined (at his own expense) a trip funded by the Heritage Foundation to Malaysia. Also on the trip were U.S. Representatives Tom DeLay, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fl.) and Ander Crenshaw (R-Fl.) and their spouses, as well as Edwin Feulner and his wife Linda Feulner, and Ken Sheffer. The Feulners and Sheffer were principals of both the Heritage Foundation and the lobbying firm Belle Haven Consultants. On September 27, 2001, Belle Haven hired ASG to represent Malaysian interests. According to U.S. Senate lobbying records, Belle Haven paid ASG $620,000 over two years \\"on behalf of unspecified Malaysian business interests seeking to present a positive image of their country in the United States\\". ASG did not register as a foreign agent, as the contract was not explicitly on behalf of the Malaysian government. At the end of 2004, Belle Haven, representing the government of Malaysia, signed a contract with ASG for $840,000 over ten months. ASG filed as a foreign agent. Virtually all of the money ASG reported receiving from Belle Haven related to the Malaysian advocacy. In addition, the US-Malaysia Exchange Association also hired ASG for support \\"enhancing the bilateral relationship between Malaysia and the US.\\" Malaysia Exchange directly paid Alexander Strategy less than $20,000 a year, according to Senate records. Heritage, Belle Haven, and ASG shared the same office in Hong Kong.  Partners and employees The firm employed several former Tom DeLay aides, including Karl Gallant and former DeLay deputy chief of staff Tony Rudy, who has since pleaded guilty for conspiracy involving Jack Abramoff. It also employed Brian Darling, the former legal counsel to Republican Senator Mel Martinez of Florida (Darling resigned after admitting he was the author of the \\"Schiavo memo\\". ASG paid Christine DeLay, Tom DeLay's wife, $115,000 during the period from 1998 to 2002, as a consultant; paid Linda Feulner (see Belle Haven, above) as a consultant; and hired Julie Doolittle, wife of Congressman John Doolittle, to do bookkeeping for a nonprofit group that Buckham created called the Korea-U.S. Exchange Council. Julie Doolittle has received a subpoena from the grand jury investigating Jack Abramoff, according to her lawyer.

It operates Boeing 737 Business Jets and Bombardier Challenger 604s from Defence Establishment Fairbairn in Canberra. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for standard transport duties during World War II, initially flying de Havilland DH.84 Dragons in Northern Australia. In 1943 it re- equipped with Douglas C-47 Dakotas, which it operated in New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies prior to disbanding in June 1946. The unit was re- established in March 1948 as No. 34 (Communications) Squadron at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, where it supported activities at the Woomera Rocket Range before disbanding in October 1955. It was re-raised as No. 34 (VIP) Flight in March 1956 at RAAF Base Canberra (later Fairbairn). No. 34 Flight was redesignated No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron in July 1959, and No. 34 Squadron in June 1963. During the 1960s it operated Dakotas, Convair Metropolitans, Vickers Viscounts, Dassault Falcon-Mysteres, Hawker Siddeley HS 748s, and BAC 1-11s, the last three types continuing in service until the late 1980s. The squadron's fleet consisted solely of Dassault Falcon 900s from 1989 until 2002, when it began operating the 737 and Challenger. The Challengers were replaced with Dassault Falcon 7Xs in 2019. Role and equipment alt=A twin-tailjet, high-tailplane passenger aircraft painted white above and grey below in front of an aircraft hangar and other buildings. A similar aircraft is visible in the background. No. 34 Squadron is the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) unit responsible for the transport of VIPs, including members of the Australian government, the Governor-General, and visiting dignitaries. It is based at Defence Establishment Fairbairn in Canberra, and administered by No. 84 Wing, which is part of Air Mobility Group. The squadron has a secondary role providing emergency transport during humanitarian operations. Its motto is Eo et redeo (\\"I Go and I Return\\"). As of 2011, No. 34 Squadron's strength included around thirty pilots and thirty flight attendants. Captains are generally senior pilots who have previously flown the RAAF's Boeing C-17 Globemaster, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, or Lockheed AP-3C Orion. Their co-pilots are new RAAF personnel who have recently graduated from No. 2 Flying Training School, and the crew attendants are posted to the squadron after completing training and a period of service with No. 33 Squadron. The squadron's VIP Operations Cell (VIPOPS) is responsible for managing requests for VIP air transport as well as dedicated security staff. Most logistical support, including meal preparation, is provided under commercial arrangements rather than by RAAF personnel. No. 34 Squadron operates two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s. The aircraft are leased from, and maintained by, the Special Purpose Aircraft Business Unit of Qantas Defence Services in Fairbairn. The lease commenced in 2002 and is due to expire in 2014. The twin-engined Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) is crewed by two pilots and up to four flight attendants, and can carry thirty passengers. The twinjet Challenger has a crew of two pilots and one flight attendant, and carries up to nine passengers. The BBJ, which has a range of over , is generally used for long-range transport, and the Challenger on shorter routes. The jets are classified as \\"Special Purpose Aircraft\\", meaning that their tasking is governed by Federal guidelines for carrying \\"entitled persons\\" on official business. To minimise government outlay, the jets may not be employed when available commercial flights satisfy the timing, location and security requirements of a given task. No. 34 Squadron conducts between 1,200 and 1,800 flights each year. A Schedule of Special Purpose Flights is tabled twice annually in Federal Parliament. VIPOPS usually assigns one of No. 34 Squadron's aircraft to approved tasks, but other Australian Defence Force aircraft are occasionally used for tasks not suited to the BBJ or Challenger; for instance, Prime Minister Julia Gillard travelled to China on board a No. 33 Squadron Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport in April 2013. History =World War II and aftermath= alt=Five twin-engined cargo planes in flight During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four transport units: Nos. 33, 34, 35 and 36 Squadrons.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 481 . No. 34 (Transport) Squadron was established on 23 February at RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, four days after the city was bombed for the first time. Coming under the control of North-Western Area Command, the squadron's initial strength was six personnel and two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons. They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia. As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese prisoner of war to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2 March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at Wyndham, Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft unserviceable, and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to Daly Waters Airfield on 5 March. On 14 March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1 July, a few days after the plane crashlanded south of Katherine. The squadron relocated again on 15 July, this time to Hughes Airfield. It remained at Hughes until 27 August, when it transferred to Manbulloo Airfield; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13 December and its aircraft transferred to No. 6 Communications Flight. No. 34 Squadron was re-formed on 3 January 1943 at Parafield Airport, South Australia, from elements of No. 36 Squadron formerly based at Essendon, Victoria. Initially comprising ninety-six personnel and eight aircraft, by the end of the month the squadron's strength had been reduced to seventy personnel and three Dragons operating in South Australia and the Northern Territory. On 11 March one of the Dragons was destroyed on takeoff at Parafield, causing two deaths‚ÄîNo. 34 Squadron's first fatalities. Another Dragon was lost in a fire after it crashlanded near Tennant Creek in April. Beginning in May 1943, the Dragons were augmented by Douglas C-47 Dakotas, giving the squadron a total strength of three Dakotas and two Dragons by the following month. By July, No. 34 Squadron was operating five Dakotas, which had fully replaced the Dragons, and in August its strength stood at seven Dakotas and 153 personnel, including forty-seven officers. It subsequently received an Airspeed Oxford and a Douglas DC-2, and began making supply drops and medical evacuations as far north as Port Moresby, New Guinea. The squadron had its busiest month in May 1944, transporting almost 1,900 passengers and over of cargo. On 1 June it became the first operational RAAF squadron to have personnel of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) in its ranks, a contingent made up of an officer and twenty airwomen. The WAAAF had been formed in 1941 and eventually made up thirty-one per cent of RAAF ground staff; its members were primarily employed in technical trades and were not permitted to serve in combat theatres.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 492 . Former No. 34 Squadron Bristol Freighter preserved at alt=Twin-engined cargo plane painted white and grey with orange extremities, parked on tarmac October 1944 saw a detachment of the squadron operating from Cape York in Far North Queensland to bases in the Dutch East Indies. Additional detachments were located at Townsville, Queensland, and Coomalie Creek, Northern Territory. In February 1945, No. 34 Squadron commenced a relocation to Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, under the control of the Australian First Tactical Air Force, and was fully established at its new base by mid-April.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 481 . The squadron supported the invasion of Borneo, and its Dakotas were the first Allied aircraft to land at Labuan and Tarakan after the islands were captured. It remained at Morotai until the end of the war, at which time it became involved in repatriating Australian former prisoners of war from Singapore, and then in courier flights supporting the formation of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. No. 34 Squadron returned to Australia between January and March 1946 and disbanded at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 6 June. The squadron was re-established at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, on 1 March 1948, when No. 2 (Communications) Squadron was renamed No. 34 (Communications) Squadron.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 45‚Äì46 It operated as a VIP transport, courier and reconnaissance unit, primarily in support of the Woomera rocket range, focal point of the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Project during the Cold War. No. 34 (Communications) Squadron flew the only Vickers Viking to be taken on strength by the RAAF, and was also the only RAAF squadron to operate the Bristol Freighter. Three Freighters were taken on strength in April and May 1949, and a fourth in September 1951; one was lost with all three crew members in a crash near Mallala on 25 November 1953 after its wing failed in flight. The squadron also operated Percival Prince, Auster, Dakota and Anson aircraft, undertaking regular transport duties and disaster relief along with its Woomera support work before disbanding at Mallala on 28 October 1955. =VIP operations= alt=Four-engined turboprop passenger plane parked on airstrip No. 34 (VIP) Flight was established at RAAF Base Canberra on 12 March 1956, and charged with the safe carriage of the Governor-General, senior Australian politicians and military officers, and visiting foreign dignitaries. It was formed from the VIP Flight of No. 36 Squadron, under No. 86 (Transport) Wing. The VIP Flight had absorbed the RAAF's Governor-General's Flight in October 1950. In its first year of operation, No. 34 Flight carried the Duke of Edinburgh on his tour of Australia. It was equipped with two Convair 440 Metropolitans, as well as Dakotas. The flight remained in Canberra when No. 86 Wing relocated to Richmond in 1958. On 1 July 1959, it was re- formed as No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron, leaving the control of No. 86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by Home Command and tasked by RAAF Base Canberra. \\"Possibly because of the rank of its clients\\", contended the official history of the post-war Air Force, the squadron maintained higher standards than other transport units, adopting some procedures from the civil aviation world. It also benefitted from the personal interest of senior officials when it came to upgrading its equipment, though this had some negative aspects. The acquisition of the Metropolitans, the first pressurised aircraft in the VIP fleet, was organised by Minister for Air Athol Townley without any advance discussion with the RAAF. Although the Air Force raised performance and safety concerns, the type's entry into service was a fait accompli, and it remained on strength for twelve years. Until the early 1960s, the VIP unit also operated two de Havilland Vampire jets and two CAC Winjeel trainers to allow staff officers at Canberra's Department of Air to maintain their flying proficiency. No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron's home in Canberra was renamed RAAF Base Fairbairn in March 1962, and the unit was redesignated No. 34 Squadron on 13 June 1963. That year, the squadron carried Queen Elizabeth II for the first time. In October 1964, two second- hand Vickers Viscount turboprop transports were obtained to supplement the Dakotas and Convairs; the two piston-engine types were withdrawn after the delivery of two Hawker Siddeley HS 748s beginning in April 1967 and three Dassault Falcon 20 jets (known as Mystere in RAAF service) in June. Two BAC 1-11 jets joined the squadron on 19 January 1968, and the two Viscounts were retired in March the following year. The wholesale re-equipment of the VIP fleet in the late 1960s was controversial, and questions were raised in Parliament regarding its cost and operations. The so-called \\"VIP affair\\" led to more stringent guidelines governing No. 34 Squadron's tasking, requiring approval for flights to be made by the British Royal Family, the Governor- General, the Prime Minister, or the Minister for Air. Eligibility criteria were also codified, and potential passengers included Federal ministers, opposition leaders, \\"individuals of similar status and importance visiting Australia\\", two-star officers and above, and other dignitaries of similar status. During the 1970s one of No. 34 Squadron's BAC 1-11s experienced an engine failure over the Tasman Sea while carrying Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to New Zealand. The aircraft made a safe landing in Australia, but the incident led the RAAF to investigate using three- or four-engined aircraft for future VIP flights involving long over-water legs. The government eventually purchased two Boeing 707s from Qantas to perform long-range VIP flights and to improve the RAAF's strategic transport capabilities. Entering service in 1979, they joined the newly established No. 33 Flight (later No. 33 Squadron) in 1981. More 707s were acquired between 1983 and 1988, and four were converted for air-to-air refuelling in the early 1990s. In 1984, No. 34 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency. alt=Trijet passenger plane on runway, with nose of another aircraft in background The squadron again became part of No. 86 Wing in June 1988, though its tasking continued to be controlled by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the Minister for Defence. Commencing in September 1989, the twinjet Mysteres and BAC 1-11s were replaced by five trijet Dassault Falcon 900s leased from Hawker Pacific, the first time the RAAF had leased aircraft from a commercial company. The two HS 748s were transferred to the newly formed No. 32 Squadron at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. Responsibility for servicing the Falcon 900s was shared by No. 34 Squadron and Hawker Pacific, the latter performing heavy maintenance. In an unusual operation for the squadron, one of the Falcons was dispatched to Jordan in September 1990 to evacuate thirteen Australian citizens who had been held hostage in Iraq. On 21 December 1992, a Falcon 900 became the first RAAF aircraft to take part in United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, when it departed RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with a team of Australian Army personnel to reconnoitre the theatre of operations. The unit received a commendation from the Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, shortly before his retirement in 1993. In January 1998, No. 84 Wing was organised as a special transport wing under Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). The term \\"special transport\\" referred to activities not directly related to army support, such as carrying VIPs. Headquartered at Richmond, No. 84 Wing took control of Nos. 32, 33 and 34 Squadrons. A flight by one of No. 34 Squadron's Falcons preceded INTERFET operations in East Timor in 1999, carrying senior Australian military and diplomatic staff to Dili on a goodwill mission. alt=Twin-jet passenger plane in flight, wheels down The Falcon 900s were replaced by two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s in July 2002. The new aircraft also replaced the two Boeing 707s operated by No. 33 Squadron in the VIP transport role. The 707s had permitted journalists to travel with the Prime Minister on international flights, and in replacing the bigger jets with 737s the Liberal government of the time determined that media contingents covering VIP trips should travel on civil aircraft. This decision led to controversy in 2007, after the crash of a Garuda airliner killed four Australian government officials and a journalist travelling in connection with a visit to Indonesia by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who had flown on a Challenger. No. 34 Squadron and Qantas Defence Services marked 20,000 incident-free flying hours with the 737s and Challengers on 21 October 2008. The following year saw further controversy when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had to apologise for remarks to a cabin attendant over the meal he was served on one of the jets. In 2011, the squadron provided VIP transport during tours of Australia by Queen Elizabeth, Prince William, and Frederik and Mary of Denmark, as well as support for US President Barack Obama's visit to Canberra. It also flew senior government and military personnel in support of relief efforts during the Queensland floods, and was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency. No. 34 Squadron celebrated its 70th anniversary at Parliament House, Canberra, on 18 February 2012; the following day, a memorial to its first fatalities in March 1942 was unveiled at Fairbairn. The lease on its aircraft is due to expire in 2014, and they may be replaced with new types. On 13 October 2017, No. 34 Squadron was transferred from No. 84 Wing to No. 86 Wing. This change was made to place the unit under the same headquarters as No. 33 Squadron, whose Airbus KC-30A aircraft are gaining a VIP role. No. 34 Squadron's Challengers were replaced with three Dassault Falcon 7Xs in 2019. These aircraft are also leased, and are larger and longer-ranged than the Challengers and have better communications equipment.

The town is built around an oasis of date palms, called Tazdayt, meaning \\"palm tree\\" in the Berber language, surrounded by rugged, mountainous wilderness. Modernization has somewhat raised the standard of living, and drawn much of the town's population away, so that it is now struggling to reach stability. Its population in 2014 was 10,872, down from a peak of 14,571 in 1982. The Ksour Range is a mountainous area extending between Figuig and El Bayadh.Montagnes des Ksour - G√©ographie militaire  Population  The majority population of Figuig speaks the Berber language. The Fenazza, a fraction of the Sliman u Muhammad, constitute the oldest group. The Sanhaja have left their traces in the toponymy (the mountain, the pass and the village which bear the name of Zenaga are witnesses). The whole population speaks a Berber dialect, the Figig Berber, mixed with Zenati and Arabic elements. Women speak only in this language, while men also speak Moroccan Arabic. The Figig Berber is understood from the area of A√Øn Sefra in the east to the Atlas in the west. According to the French linguist Ren√© Basset, this dialect is the only one that survives from the Algerian-Moroccan highlands and southern Moroccan languages that preceded the invasion of the Banu Hilal. In addition to the Berber-speaking sedentary, the population of the oases includes many \\"marabouts\\" who call themselves sharifs and have played an important role in social cohesion over the past centuries, softening feuds and quarrels between villages or within villages. A third element of the population is the Harratins gathered in Zenaga where they live in a particular neighborhood: Al- Hahda. They are workers of inferior status, responsible for the maintenance of the foggaras and, in general, the main agricultural works in the palm plantation. The descendants of slaves are often confused with the Harratins. The small Jewish Berber population, formerly gathered in the two mellahs of Zenaga and Udaghir, has practically disappeared. There were 5,000 subjects at the beginning of the twentieth century.  Aghrem  Figuig consists of seven different communities (Ighermawen in South Oran Berber dialect) which are: At- Wadday, At-Amar, At-Lamiz, At-Sliman, At-Annaj, At-Addi, Iznayen. A community territory is called an Agram, which is the word some local Berbers use to describe themselves in their tongue; plural Igramawan. The communities are usually made up of a fortified group of houses. Many Agrams are designed with defensive measures like watch-towers and heavy doors on the main entrances, which are closed at night, as well as a mazelike layout, called an Abrid (meaning \\"pathway\\" in Berber), which makes navigation for unwanted intruders extremely difficult. Homes, or Tidriwin, are extended by building rooms over the alleyways; these extensions are referred to as Askif. Houses are built mainly with soil, though palm trunks (tizidin) and leaf-heads (tikachba, taratta) are used in roof construction. The arrival of electricity, plumbing, and concrete construction has not essentially altered the nature of Aghram building. However, modern age buildings are being built more and more in the newly appointed area's at the edge of each \\"Agram\\". Culture Figuig mosque in January 1913. Aghrams are often centered on a plaza once used for communal gatherings and shopping. Arab nomads would exhibit merchandise like cooked butter (Udi), dried milk (Ibrassa), and sheep wool (Douft). However, due to lack of demand and western-influenced tastes, the plaza-markets have waned in both their variety and importance. The akharbish education, often held near a mosque, had already been replaced by modern French schools since the establishment of the French colonisation. This trend has only been strengthened by the advantages a Western French education is perceived to confer, and as a result, knowledge of the Berber language has suffered. The original mainly spoken language is Amazigh (a Berber language). Figuig's population are referred to as At-Ufyyey in that language. Amazigh is spoken but not written in Figuig. Agriculture Cistern in Figuig, January 1913 The town was established next to an oasis of date palms, and dates, or tiyni, are by far its most important resource. Some hundreds of thousands of date palms are cultivated in the area, and their fruit has become Figuig's primary crop. In the 1960s and 1970s however, Figuig had lost countless date palms because of the Bayud disease. Wheat, or tasharza, is also an important product of the town. Its cultivation near the town assured a steady supply of the crucial grain which allowed for a higher quality of life. In order to increase arable land, many private farmers have constructed soil-filled stone terraces along the Jorf, a salt mountain nearby. The Jorf is a sort of salt mountain about 1 kilometre long and 50 metres high. It is a nesting site of wild pigeons and bees, as well as scorpions and snakes, and is divided between several private landowners . The Jorf also serves to divide between the upper and lower portions of the town, and several thoroughfares connecting them run across it. The town's water-supply (aman) is drawn from its northern end, near the pass which serves as the main entrance to Figuig, and water can generally be found there at the shallow depth of 10 metres. The water is conducted from its source via underground channels (lakbawat) to lime and stone or cement cisterns (sharij), from which farmers can utilise it at their convenience. The cisterns sometimes double as swimming holes to provide recreation for the local children. Modernisation New technologies such as cement and steel construction, as well as electricity, gas, telegraphs, cellular networks, digital satellite programming, and even Broadband Internet access, have made their way to Figuig. These developments have begun to bring the residents remaining in the town into close-contact with local culture, and the town has even seen the opening of several cafes. Figuig is however lacking medical facilities equipped to serve a town of this size. Many patients are therefore forced to seek medical aid elsewhere. A central bureaucracy, held-over from the French control, has supplanted the tribal structure as a center of Figuigs' administration. Most people who are originally from Figuig and who live abroad visit Figuig every summer. The city becomes very crowded and teenagers enjoy meeting there. They go to swimming pools and biking as well as sightseeing.

The mechanisms for these reactions, and the rate equations are of extreme importance for heterogeneous catalysis. Via scanning tunneling microscopy, it is possible to observe reactions at the solidgas interface in real space, if the time scale of the reaction is in the correct range. Reactions at the solidgas interface are in some cases related to catalysis. Simple decomposition If a reaction occurs through these steps: : A + S ‚áå AS ‚Üí Products where A is the reactant and S is an adsorption site on the surface and the respective rate constants for the adsorption, desorption and reaction are k1, k‚àí1 and k2, then the global reaction rate is: :r=k_2 C_\\\\mathrm{AS}=k_2 \\\\theta C_\\\\mathrm{S} where: * r is the rate, mol¬∑m‚àí2¬∑s‚àí1 *C_Ais the concentration of adsorbate, mol¬∑m‚àí3 *C_\\\\mathrm{AS} is the surface concentration of occupied sites, mol¬∑m‚àí2 *C_\\\\mathrm{S} is the concentration of all sites (occupied or not), mol¬∑m‚àí2 *\\\\theta is the surface coverage, (i.e. C_{AS}/C_{S}) defined as the fraction of sites which are occupied, which is dimensionless *t is time, s *k_2 is the rate constant for the surface reaction, s‚àí1. *k_1is the rate constant for surface adsorption, m3¬∑mol‚àí1¬∑s‚àí1 *k_{-1}is the rate constant for surface desorption, s‚àí1 C_\\\\mathrm{S} is highly related to the total surface area of the adsorbent: the greater the surface area, the more sites and the faster the reaction. This is the reason why heterogeneous catalysts are usually chosen to have great surface areas (in the order of a hundred m2/gram) If we apply the steady state approximation to AS, then: : \\\\frac {dC_\\\\mathrm{AS}}{dt}= 0 = k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A} C_\\\\mathrm{S} (1-\\\\theta)- k_2 \\\\theta C_\\\\mathrm{S} -k_{-1}\\\\theta C_\\\\mathrm{S} so \\\\theta =\\\\frac {k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A}}{k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A} + k_{-1}+k_2} and :r=\\\\frac {k_1 k_2 C_\\\\mathrm{A} C_\\\\mathrm{S}}{k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A} + k_{-1}+k_2}. The result is equivalent to the Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics of reactions catalyzed at a site on an enzyme. The rate equation is complex, and the reaction order is not clear. In experimental work, usually two extreme cases are looked for in order to prove the mechanism. In them, the rate- determining step can be: *Limiting step: adsorption/desorption :k_2 \\\\gg \\\\ k_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}, k_{-1},\\\\text{ so }r \\\\approx k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A} C_\\\\mathrm{S}. The order respect to A is 1. Examples of this mechanism are N2O on gold and HI on platinum *Limiting step: reaction of adsorbed species :k_2 \\\\ll \\\\ k_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}, k_{-1}\\\\text{ so }\\\\theta =\\\\frac {k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A}}{k_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A} + k_{-1}} =\\\\frac {K_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A}}{K_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A} + 1} The last expression is the Langmuir isotherm for the surface coverage. The adsorption equilibrium constant K_1=\\\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}, and the numerator and denominator have each been divided by k_{-1}. The overall reaction rate becomes r= \\\\frac {K_1 k_2 C_\\\\mathrm{A} C_\\\\mathrm{S}}{K_1 C_\\\\mathrm{A}+1}. Depending on the concentration of the reactant the rate changes: :* Low concentrations, then r= K_1 k_2 C_\\\\mathrm{A} C_\\\\mathrm{S}, that is to say a first order reaction in component A. :* High concentration, then r= k_2 C_\\\\mathrm{S}. It is a zeroth order reaction in component A. Bimolecular reaction =Langmuir‚ÄìHinshelwood mechanism= In this mechanism, suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1921 and further developed by Cyril Hinshelwood in 1926, two molecules adsorb on neighboring sites and the adsorbed molecules undergo a bimolecular reaction:Keith J. Laidler and John H. Meiser Physical Chemistry (Benjamin/Cummings 1982) p.780 : A + S ‚áå AS : B + S ‚áå BS : AS + BS ‚Üí Products The rate constants are now k_1,k_{-1},k_2,k_{-2} and k for adsorption/desorption of A, adsorption/desorption of B, and reaction. The rate law is: r=k \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{A} \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{B} C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 Proceeding as before we get \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{A}=\\\\frac{k_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}\\\\theta_E}{k_{-1}+kC_\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{B}}, where \\\\theta_E is the fraction of empty sites, so \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{A}+\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{B}+\\\\theta_E=1. Let us assume now that the rate limiting step is the reaction of the adsorbed molecules, which is easily understood: the probability of two adsorbed molecules colliding is low. Then \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{A}=K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}\\\\theta_E, with K_i=k_i/k_{-i}, which is nothing but Langmuir isotherm for two adsorbed gases, with adsorption constants K_1 and K_2. Calculating \\\\theta_E from \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{A} and \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{B} we finally get ::r=k C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 \\\\frac{K_1K_2C_\\\\mathrm{A}C_\\\\mathrm{B}}{(1+K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}+K_2C_\\\\mathrm{B})^2}. The rate law is complex and there is no clear order with respect to either reactant, but we can consider different values of the constants, for which it is easy to measure integer orders: *Both molecules have low adsorption That means that 1 \\\\gg K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}, K_2C_\\\\mathrm{B}, so r=k C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 K_1K_2C_\\\\mathrm{A}C_\\\\mathrm{B}. The order is one with respect to each reactant, and the overall order is two. *One molecule has very low adsorption In this case K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}, 1 \\\\gg K_2C_\\\\mathrm{B}, so r=k C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 \\\\frac{K_1K_2C_\\\\mathrm{A}C_\\\\mathrm{B}}{(1+K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A})^2}. The reaction order is 1 with respect to B. There are two extreme possibilities for the order with respect to A: :# At low concentrations of A, r=k C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 K_1K_2C_\\\\mathrm{A}C_\\\\mathrm{B}, and the order is one with respect to A. :# At high concentrations, r=k C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 \\\\frac{K_2C_\\\\mathrm{B}}{K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}}. The order is minus one with respect to A. The higher the concentration of A, the slower the reaction goes, in this case we say that A inhibits the reaction. *One molecule has very high adsorption One of the reactants has very high adsorption and the other one doesn't adsorb strongly. K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A} \\\\gg 1, K_2C_\\\\mathrm{B}, so r=k C_\\\\mathrm{S}^2 \\\\frac{K_2C_\\\\mathrm{B}}{K_1C_\\\\mathrm{A}}. The reaction order is 1 with respect to B and ‚àí1 with respect to A. Reactant A inhibits the reaction at all concentrations.

He was the eldest son of Prince Katsuakira and the grandson of Emperor Daigo. His mother was the daughter of Fujiwara no Tokihira. Because the highest rank he achieved was Provisional Master of the Palace of the Empress as a lower-third rank non- councillor, he was known as , which is the Chinese reading of the characters for 'Hiromasa' and those for 'third rank'. He was an expert in , orchestral gagaku which does not accompany dance. He was also called or Lord Autumn after the Autumn Palace, the poetic name for the empress and her dwelling. When he was removed from the imperial succession, he was granted the surname Minamoto. In 934, the lower fourth rank was conferred upon him. In 947, he became the Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs. In 959, he became Captain of the Right Watch. In 965, he became the Middle Captain of the Left Palace Guards. In 974, he was promoted to the lower third rank and became Provisional Master of the Palace of the Queen Mother. He attained his mastery of gagaku, music lore has it, by studying vocal music with Prince Atsumi, koto with Emperor Daigo, biwa with Minamoto no Osamu, flute from Ooishi no Minekichi, and hichiriki from Yoshimine no Yukimusa. Bass hichiriki was his strong point, but he disliked song and dance. In 951, he played biwa at the Emperor's New Year's banquet. In 966, by the order of Emperor Murakami, he compiled an imperial music anthology, the . The system of notation he developed is still used today. There is a story that he was called upon to participate in the so-called \\"Forth Year of Tentoku Poetry Contest\\" in 960, but that he froze in front of the emperor and accidentally gave the title of one poem but recited another. He received the famous flute from the demon at the Suzakumon Gate. He retrieved the famous biwa from the Rashomon Gate. After three years of visiting Semimaru in Osaka, he was taught the secret tunes \\"Flowing Spring\\" and \\"Woodpecker\\". He appears in many tales of this kind in sources like the Konjaku Monogatarishu. Also, it is said that he held his liquor well and was a heavy drinker. About his personality, Fujiwara no Sanesuke made the following comment in his diary: \\"As for Hiromasa, he's a poet and a writer, but he neglects his duties.\\" In fiction In the novel \\"Onmyoji\\" (novel: Baku Yumemakura, manga: Reiko Okano), Hiromasa appears as the partner of the protagonist, Abe no Seimei.

After being reopened in 1977, the exchange was under the management of the newly created Capital Market Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal, or Bapepam), which answered to the Ministry of Finance. Trading activity and market capitalisation grew alongside the development of Indonesia's financial markets and private sector - highlighted by a major bull run in 1990. On 13 July 1992, the exchange was privatised under the ownership of Jakarta Exchange Inc. As a result, the functions of Bapepam changed to become the Capital Market Supervisory Agency.

It was formed on 15 September 1943 and saw service during World War II transporting supplies and personnel between Australia and the combat zones in New Guinea and Borneo, using Douglas Dakota aircraft. Following the war, the squadron conducted regular courier flights between Australia and Japan in 1947 and 1948. No. 38 Squadron was deployed to Singapore from 1950 to 1952, supplying Commonwealth forces engaged in the Malayan Emergency and undertaking courier flights across Asia. In 1954 it became responsible for training RAAF personnel to operate Dakotas. After being re-equipped with de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou in 1964, No. 38 Squadron served as the RAAF's operational conversion unit for the type and also conducted transport tasks within Australia and its territories. Throughout Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, it prepared aircrew for operational service with No. 35 Squadron, and maintained a detachment in Papua and New Guinea to provide pilots with experience flying in tropical conditions. A Caribou was deployed to Pakistan from 1975 to 1978 to support United Nations peacekeepers, and detachments were established within Australia during the 1980s to provide search and rescue capabilities and work with Australian Army units. From 1999 until 2001, a detachment was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led peacekeeping force in the newly independent nation. No. 38 Squadron continued to operate Caribou after No. 35 Squadron was disbanded in 2000, though the age of the aircraft increasingly affected its operations. Following the retirement of the Caribou from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft. The squadron was stationed at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, and was responsible for training RAAF pilots to operate King Airs, and performing light transport and tasks. It was also believed to have a ground surveillance capability. The squadron disbanded on 29 November 2018, its aircraft and roles being transferred to No. 32 Squadron. History =World War II= No. 38 Squadron was formed as a transport unit at RAAF Base Richmond near Sydney on 15 September 1943. Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron conducted its first operation on 17 December, when one of its aircraft flew from Richmond to RAAF Base Darwin. During the period No. 38 Squadron was equipped with Hudsons, it operated only within Australia.Eather (1995), p. 76 The squadron's activities expanded in early 1944, when its obsolescent Hudsons were replaced with more capable Douglas Dakota transports. It received its first Dakota on 3 March 1944, and was completely equipped with the type by the end of May. While the squadron continued to fly to locations within Australia after receiving Dakotas, it also began transporting supplies to Allied forces fighting the Japanese in western New Guinea. During return flights from New Guinea, the Dakotas typically carried wounded personnel to Australia for treatment.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 68 In October 1944, No. 38 Squadron was given the additional task of supporting the RAAF's Paratroop Training Unit at Richmond. The squadron moved to RAAF Station Archerfield near Brisbane in early December 1944, but continued to maintain a detachment at Richmond. By this time No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with transporting supplies to the battle zone in New Guinea, which included making supply drops to Australian Army units in the field and evacuating casualties to the mainland. From 17 July 1945, the squadron maintained a detachment at Morotai Island, dropping supplies to Army units fighting in Borneo. No. 38 Squadron's only loss during World War II was a Dakota that crashed on a mountain in western New Guinea while flying between Biak and Morotai; the wreckage of this aircraft was not located until 1970. After the war, No. 38 Squadron flew into Singapore, Bangkok and locations in Borneo to evacuate released Australian prisoners of war. The squadron also transported other service personnel back to Australia until 1946 as part of the demobilisation of the Australian military. During May 1946, three of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were assigned the unusual task of flying 25 tonnes of pig bristles from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia. This mission, which was designated \\"Operation Pig Bristle\\", took two weeks and sought to rectify a shortage of paint brushes that was hindering the Australian construction industry.Stephens (1995), pp. 414‚Äì415 =Asian deployments= No. 38 Squadron relocated to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney on 15 August 1946. It became part of No. 86 Wing, along with Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons, which also operated Dakotas, and No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron, which serviced the wing's flying units.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 68‚Äì69Roylance (1991), pp. 92‚Äì93 Commencing on 22 January 1947, one of No. 38 Squadron's main responsibilities was to conduct thrice-weekly courier flights to Japan to support the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. These flights were the longest regular air route serviced by twin-engined aircraft at the time, and took several days. The courier flights continued until 13 January 1948, after which chartered Qantas aircraft were used to support the force in Japan. In August 1948, five of No. 38 Squadron's air crews were dispatched to Europe where, as members of the RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift, they participated in the international efforts to fly supplies into Berlin during the Soviet blockade of the city. These personnel remained in Europe for 12 months, and their absence greatly disrupted No. 38 Squadron's operations.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 69 Overall, twenty members of No. 86 Wing were sent to Europe; the resulting shortage of personnel forced Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons to operate for a period as a single unit, all flying hours being attributed to No. 38 Squadron in official records.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 57‚Äì58 No. 86 Wing moved to Richmond between 22 June and 1 July 1949.Roylance (1991), pp. 114‚Äì118 No. 38 Squadron Dakotas at RAF Changi in 1950 In 1950, No. 38 Squadron was selected to form part of the Australian force assigned to the Commonwealth Far East Air Force. As an element of this force, the Australian Government agreed for the unit to be tasked with courier flights across Asia and providing support for the British-led counterinsurgency operations in Malaya.Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 23‚Äì25 The squadron's advance party arrived at RAF Changi in Singapore on 19 June 1950, and all of its personnel and eight Dakotas were operational there by 6 July. While in Malaya the squadron came under the command of No. 90 (Composite) Wing, along with the Avro Lincoln-equipped No. 1 Squadron. Half the squadron's aircrew were veterans of the Berlin Airlift, but none had any direct experience of tropical environments. No. 38 Squadron began flying transport missions in Malaya in early July, with British and New Zealand pilots accompanying its aircrews during the first two weeks of operations to help them become familiar with local conditions.Dennis and Grey (1996), p. 25 From July 1950 until February 1951, No. 38 Squadron's main task was to conduct courier flights to Borneo, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, and these remained an important responsibility throughout the period it was based at Singapore.Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 25‚Äì26 Following the outbreak of the Korean War, the squadron flew British troops and supplies from Singapore to Japan and Korea, and four of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were transferred to No. 30 Communication Unit in Japan during November 1950.Dennis and Grey (1996), p. 26 After losing half its strength, No. 38 Squadron remained at Changi and conducted supply and aeromedical evacuation flights throughout Malaya to support the British-led forces there. The squadron's aircraft were also occasionally used to mark targets ahead of bombing raids and to drop propaganda leaflets. From April to July 1951, No. 38 Squadron and an attached flight from No. 41 Squadron RNZAF was stationed at RAF Kuala Lumpur, and was the main unit tasked with dropping supplies to Commonwealth forces in the field. The squadron made another deployment to Kuala Lumpur between November 1951 and February 1952. In February 1952, No. 38 Squadron successfully parachuted 54 personnel from the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment into a remote area near the Malaya-Thailand border.Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 31‚Äì32 Supporting the Australian units in Korea placed heavy demands on the RAAF's transport force, which was too small to fully meet its domestic and international responsibilities, and it became increasingly difficult to sustain the four Dakotas in Malaya during 1952. As a result, the Australian Government decided in September that year to return the squadron to Australia.Dennis and Grey (1996), pp. 32‚Äì33 No. 38 Squadron left Changi for Richmond on 8 December. The squadron's only fatality during the deployment was an airman who was killed when the No. 110 Squadron RAF Dakota he was co- piloting crashed during a flight between Changi and Saigon on 31 August 1950.Dennis and Grey (1996), p. 27 =Operational conversion unit= After returning to Richmond, No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with routine transport duties. The squadron also occasionally provided aircraft for CSIRO rainmaking experiments.Eather (1995), p. 77 During the 1950s and early 1960s, No. 38 Squadron developed a reputation as a \\"cowboy\\" unit with lax flying standards. The squadron did not conduct proper conversion courses, and new Dakota pilots received only ad-hoc instruction on the type while serving as the co-pilot during operational tasks.Stephens (1995), p. 415 On 8 March 1953, No. 38 Squadron absorbed No. 36 Squadron's Dakotas, after which No. 30 Transport Unit (previously No. 30 Communication Unit) in Japan was renamed No. 36 Squadron. From late March until September 1954, No. 38 Squadron conducted VIP flights out of RAAF Station Canberra. In November that year, it was renamed the Transport Training Squadron and became responsible for instructing new Dakota crews and RAAF air movements personnel. It resumed its previous name on 13 June 1963. No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with new de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou tactical transport aircraft during 1964. In January 1964 the unit's commanding officer, five other pilots and three navigators undertook conversion training on the type in Canada. At the completion of this course the personnel flew the RAAF's first three Caribous from Toronto to RAAF Base Richmond between 17 March and 22 April.Wilson (1990), p. 280 The process of fully converting No. 38 Squadron to Caribous was delayed by the government's decision to deploy several of the aircraft to Vietnam; at the time this decision was made, in June 1964, the squadron had received six of its planned allocation of nine aircraft, and the next batch of three aircraft was sent directly to Vietnam.Coulthard-Clark (1995), pp. 35, 38 No. 38 Squadron was the last operational RAAF squadron to fly Dakotas, though several other units did so until the 1990s.Wilson (1990), p. 45 After receiving its Caribous, No. 38 Squadron's main role was to train aircrews for operational service with the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (later redesignated No. 35 Squadron). On 1 July 1964, one of the squadron's Caribous suffered severe damage when it made a crash landing at HMAS Albatross; this aircraft was subsequently written off and its fuselage used for training purposes by the Army's 1st Commando Regiment.Wilson (1990), p. 184 The squadron became an independent unit under Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond in August that year, following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing.Stephens (1995), pp. 424‚Äì425 On 13 October 1965, Detachment A of No. 38 Squadron began operations from Port Moresby in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, equipped with two Caribous.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 70Wilson (1990), p. 201 One of the detachment's tasks was to give Caribou pilots experience in tropical and mountainous conditions, and all aircraft captains were required to complete at least one two-month deployment to Port Moresby before serving with No. 35 Squadron in Vietnam.Coulthard-Clark (1995), p. 109 In addition to its training role, No. 38 Squadron undertook transport flights in and around Australia, taking part when required in relief efforts following natural disasters. =Peacekeeping deployments= Exercise Talisman Sabre 2009 The squadron undertook two operational deployments during the mid-1970s. From March 1975 until November 1978 Detachment B, comprising a single Caribou and support staff, was stationed at Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and transported personnel and supplies for the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.Wilson (1990), p. 209 From August to October 1975, a No. 38 Squadron Caribou was assigned to transport Red Cross supplies and personnel from Darwin to East Timor after a civil war broke out in that country. On 4 September that year this aircraft was hijacked by East Timorese soldiers, who forced the pilot to fly 54 refugees to Darwin; it remains the only RAAF aircraft ever to have been hijacked. Detachment A was no longer required after Papua New Guinea achieved independence from Australia and established its own defence force, and the unit was disbanded on 17 January 1976.Wilson (1990), p. 204 Three Caribous were lost while operating with the detachment; A4-202 crashed near Porgera on 3 June 1965, A4-147 was written off after it landed short of the runway at Tapini Airport on 6 October 1968 and A4-233 was destroyed when it crashed at Kudjeru Gap on 28 August 1972.Wilson (1990), pp. 204‚Äì208 The last of these crashes caused the deaths of 25 aircrew and passengers, making it the RAAF's worst peacetime disaster; 21 of the people killed were high school students returning from an army cadet camp. Following the end of its permanent presence at Port Moresby, No. 38 Squadron continued to fly periodic training sorties in Papua New Guinea. During the 1980s, detachments of No. 38 Squadron were established at RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Pearce near Perth to provide these regions with a search-and-rescue capability and to exercise with Army units. The Pearce detachment was nicknamed \\"Blackduck Airlines\\". No. 38 Squadron moved from Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At this time the squadron continued to be responsible for all Caribou conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips.Wilson (2003), pp. 25‚Äì30 Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate.Wilson (2003), p. 25 In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004.O'Brien (2009), pp. 203‚Äì205 All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008. =Light transport and surveillance= By the late 2000s the Caribous were becoming difficult to maintain, and were no longer capable of operating in war zones as they lacked electronic warfare systems and other forms of self-protection. As a result, it was decided in late 2008 to retire the aircraft and replace them with Beechcraft King Air 350s on an interim basis until another tactical transport entered service.McLaughlin (2010), p. 40 The Caribous were gradually retired from May 2009, the last leaving service on 27 November that year when A4-140 was flown to Canberra and handed over to the Australian War Memorial for preservation.McLaughlin (2010), p. 41 By the time the aircraft were retired, No. 38 Squadron had been operating Caribous for 45 years. Three King Air 350s were transferred to No. 38 Squadron from the Army's 173rd Surveillance Squadron on 20 November 2009, and deliveries of a further five newly built aircraft were completed in July 2010. At least one of the Army aircraft is believed to have been fitted with ground surveillance sensors, and this capacity was retained after it was transferred to the Air Force.Pittaway (October‚ÄìDecember 2016), pp. 47‚Äì49 No. 38 Squadron's King Airs were initially operated by Army personnel, who were given the choice of transferring to the RAAF or converting to helicopters at the end of their posting. The other No. 38 pilots were converted to the type at the Army's Oakey Army Aviation Centre, but the squadron began conducting its own conversion courses after the second batch of five aircraft were delivered.Pittaway (October‚ÄìDecember 2016), p. 49 No. 38 Squadron marked its 70th anniversary in 2013. In March 2015 two No. 38 Squadron King Airs were deployed to Vanuatu as part of Australia's aid effort following Cyclone Pam. The aircraft were used to conduct flights over the affected areas to assess the extent of the damage, and also evacuated Australian and New Zealand citizens. All of the RAAF's King Airs were grounded from 30 June 2016 after the hazardous chemical strontium chromate was detected in the aircraft; in the period immediately before the grounding No. 38 Squadron had been involved in flying politicians during the 2016 federal election. The King Airs began to return to service on 4 August that year after being cleaned. As part of its budget for the 2016‚Äì17 financial year, the Australian Government announced that Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare equipment would be acquired for three of No. 38 Squadron's King Airs. This equipment comprised roll- on/roll-off kits, and was scheduled to be delivered during the financial year. In February 2016 it was reported that the RAAF was considering consolidating its two squadrons equipped with King Airs into a single squadron located at RAAF Base East Sale.Pittaway (February 2016), p. 28 No. 38 Squadron began to be reduced in size during that year.Serenc (2018), p. 77 In February 2018 the Department of Defence announced that No. 38 Squadron would relocate to RAAF Base East Sale later that year. The September 2018 edition of Australian Aviation reported that No. 38 Squadron was to be disbanded in November 2018.Serenc (2018), p. 72 No. 38 Squadron was disbanded at a ceremony at RAAF Base Townsville on 29 November 2018. This marked the end of 75 years continuous service, the longest period for any RAAF squadron. Its aircraft and role, including the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare function, was transferred to No. 32 Squadron.Serenc (2018), p. 74 Role prior to disbandment A No. 38 Squadron King Air in 2013 In its final role, No. 38 Squadron was responsible for providing conversion training on the King Air and conducting light transport operations. As of 2014, the unit had a strength of 60 RAAF personnel as well as 25 aircraft maintenance contractors from Hawker Pacific. It was organised into two flights; A Flight undertook transport operations, and B Flight was responsible for delivering training courses.McLaughlin (2010), p. 42 As of 2018, the squadron's Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare capabilities were classified, but were reported to include a communications relay function. The aircraft had also been used as a platform for aerial photography after being transferred to the RAAF; this has included taking photographs to be used in map making. Along with Nos. 33 and 36 Squadrons, No. 38 Squadron formed part of No. 86 Wing. The RAAF was satisfied with the King Air's performance in the light transport role, though the aircraft could not be deployed into combat areas. No. 38 Squadron often operated with the Army's Townsville-based 3rd Brigade, as well as the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, which conducts operational patrols across Far North Queensland during peacetime. The unit was also frequently tasked with transporting senior politicians and other VIPs. The King Airs often operated in Papua New Guinea, as well as other parts of the Asia-Pacific region.

First broadcast on August 27, 2000, the film was the first of two film-length installments for MTV's animated series Daria. The film chronicles the characters' summer break between seasons four and five. The film was released on both VHS and DVD formats on April 15, 2002, and was included on the DVD release of Daria: The Complete Animated Series on May 11, 2010. Plot Though Daria and Jane are still on speaking terms, Jane is cold toward Daria, and their relationship is tense. Daria and Tom are seeing each other romantically, but due to Daria's personality and the gravity of the situation, they are taking things slowly. Jane has signed up for a summer art camp, seemingly to avoid Daria. At the camp, Jane meets Alison, an older artist, and the two bond over mutual contempt for their pretentious mentor and equally pretentious peers. However, Alison repeatedly tries to come onto Jane, dismissing Jane's protests that she is straight. The next time they meet, Jane signals uncertainty about her own sexuality. But this turns to anger when she realizes that, after previously putting down their pompous instructor to ingratiate herself with Jane, Alison is now sleeping with him to further her career. This causes Jane to become disillusioned with the art world. Daria intends to do nothing but read, sleep, and hang out with her friends and boyfriend, but her mother Helen forces her to work as a counselor at English teacher Timothy O'Neill's summer day camp for pre-pubescent children. There, Daria meets a nihilistic camper named Link, who constantly voices his disillusionment. It is loosely implied that he is neglected by his mother and his stepfather. Recognizing herself in Link, Daria attempts to reach out to him. However, he rejects her overtures, causing Daria to feel worse. Paralleling these emotions is her relationship with Tom, which she effectively ends for the discomfort it brings. After getting a poor score on a pre-college admissions exam, Quinn desperately wants to prove her intelligence without ruining her image in the fashion club. Helen hires David, a no-nonsense tutor who gets Quinn to take learning more seriously. As the tutoring gets results, Quinn realizes that she is interested in David romantically. At their final session, she confesses her feelings to him, but David says she is not his type due to her low academic aspirations, noting that the college Quinn wants to attend is a party school. In a heart-to-heart talk with Daria, Quinn shows how much the rejection hurt her, but Daria convinces her that it is worthwhile to \\"give people a chance\\" even though things might not work out. The talk makes Daria consider whether she broke up with Tom prematurely. Daria comes to visit Jane, and, due to some meddling from Jane's brother Trent, the two reconcile. Daria later tells Jane that she was always impressed by Jane's strong sense of identity, which resolves Jane's identity crisis. Daria receives a letter from Link that invites her to email him, assuaging her fears that she is incapable of connecting with another human being. Jane affirms that she is no longer upset that Daria dated Tom and encourages her to get back together with him.

He was Secretary at War during the Harley administration from 1710 to 1712. He was also a noted poet and made a name for himself with verses composed on the visit of Mary of Modena, then Duchess of York, while he was at Cambridge in 1677. He was also playwright, following in the style of John Dryden. Origins Granville was the son of Bernard Granville, the fourth son of Sir Bevil Grenville (1596-1643) of Bideford in Devon and Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall, a heroic Royalist commander in the Civil War. (The family changed the spelling of its name in 1661 from \\"Grenville\\" to \\"Granville\\", following the grant of the titles Baron Granville and Earl of Bath).J. Horace Round, Family Origins and Other Studies, ed. Page, William, 1930, p.164, The Granvilles and the Monks, p.130 His uncle was John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628-1701) whose half-first-cousin was George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, who both played leading roles in the restoration of the monarchy to King Charles II in 1660. He was heir male of William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692-1711),J. Horace Round, Family Origins and Other Studies, ed. Page, William, 1930, p.164, The Granvilles and the Monks, p.141 the 19-year-old son of his first cousin Charles Granville, 2nd Earl of Bath (1661‚Äì1701), lord of the manors of Bideford in Devon and of Stowe, Kilkhampton, Cornwall. These connections guaranteed that Granville began life as a staunch Tory and Jacobite. Career Granville as depicted in Walpole's A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble Authors, 1806. Granville was sent to France at the age of ten, with his tutor, William Ellis, who was a proponent of passive resistance and later a servant of James II at St Germain. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1677. Among his productions while there were poems welcoming Mary of Modena when she visited the university. In 1682, he went to Paris with his brother Sir Bevill Granville, where they studied fencing, riding, dancing, mathematics and military science. He stayed in France until 1687, accumulating a ¬£500 debt. He then lived in England at his mother's house at Marr, near Doncaster. His early interests were literary and by the mid-1690s he had befriended John Dryden and begun to write plays. He wrote an undistinguished comedy of manners entitled The She Gallants, which was staged unsuccessfully in 1695. His adult plays bear the marks of Dryden's influence. The Heroick Love is taken from the first book of Homer's Iliad. Granville also followed Dryden in adapting Shakespeare and Granville's The Jew of Venice (1701) was a successful updating of The Merchant of Venice. Perhaps his greatest success was The British Enchanters (1705), a pseudo-operatic extravaganza staged by Thomas Betterton's company. In the opinion of Samuel Johnson, Granville's non-dramatic poetry is slavishly imitative of Edmund Waller. However some of his poetry was popular in its day. Perhaps Granville's most useful act as regards poetry was the encouragement he gave to Alexander Pope, which Pope remembered with gratitude in his Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot. Political life achievement of George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne, detail from parapet of Queen Anne's Walk, Barnstaple, Devon, completed circa 1713. Motto of Granville, Baron Lansdowne: Deo, Patriae, Amicis (\\"For God, my Country and Friends\\"). The motto of his uncle John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath was: Futurum invisibile (\\"The future is unseen\\")As seen on his heraldic achievement in the Church of St James the Great, Kilkhampton, Cornwall The death of Granville's parents and of his uncle the 1st Earl of Bath in 1701 placed Granville in a position of power which the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 allowed him to employ. With the help of his cousin, Hon. John Granville, an influential Tory leader, he was elected Member of Parliament for Fowey at the 1702 English general election. When his elder brother, Sir Bevill Granville, was appointed Governor of Barbados, Granville inherited his office as constable of Pendennis Castle in 1703. In Parliament, he operated in the sphere of Harley, who was an indifferent patron at first. He was absent from the division on the Tack, becoming labelled a ‚ÄòSneaker‚Äô. He was returned unopposed for Fowey at the 1705 English general election and with the help of Harley fended of an attempt to remove him from his post at Pendennis Castle. His aspiration to obtain a post led him to support the Court in voting for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705, and he again supported the Court on the ‚Äòplace clause‚Äô of the regency bill in February 1706. At the 1708 general election, he was returned again for Fowey. The height of his fame during the Godolphin-Marlborough administration came from his spirited defence of Henry Sacheverell in 1710. After the fall of the Godolphin government, Granville became MP for Cornwall at the 1710 British general election, and on 28 September 1710 he was made Secretary at War.Haydn, Joseph, Book of Dignities (London: Longman, Brown, Green & Longman, 1851), p. 190. In this capacity, he oversaw the passage of important bills on munitions and recruitment. However, his experience in the Tory government was marked by family and legal strife. He was the heir male to the senior line of the Granville family following the death without progeny in 1711 of his cousin William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath. He was not in succession to the earldom and was in recognition raised to the peerage on 1 January 1712 as Baron Lansdown of BidefordRound, p.141 in the Peerage of Great Britain and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. He was one of Harley's Dozen created at once to change the political balance in the Whig-dominated Lord. He expended time and money in an ultimately futile effort to secure the title of Earl of Bath. Despite some success, his tenure in the War Office was marred by accusations of corruption and expensive contested elections. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1712. In 1714 Queen Anne was succeeded by the Hanoverian King George I, who favoured the Whigs. Almost all the Tories who held office under Anne were dismissed, including Lord Lansdown. Embittered, he began a secret correspondence with the Jacobite Old Pretender \\"James III\\". On 6 October 1721 James, who refused to recognise his peerage \\"Baron Lansdown\\" bestowed by Queen Anne,The new patent referred to him as \\"George Granvill, commonly called Lord Lansdown...\\" (Round, p.141) created him \\"Lord of Lansdown\\",\\" Viscount [ ]\\" and \\"Earl of Bath\\" in the Jacobite Peerage of England, with remainder to his heirs male. On 3 November 1721 James created him \\"Duke of Albemarle\\", \\"Marquis Monck and Fitzhemmon\\", \\"Earl of Bath\\", \\"Viscount Bevel\\", and \\"Baron Lansdown of Bideford\\" in the Jacobite Peerage of England, which supposed titles had no legal validity in the Kingdom of Great Britain. One of these titles referred to his family's supposed descent (officially confirmed to the 1st Earl of Bath by warrant of King Charles II in 1661Round, p.140) from Richard I de Grenville (d.post 1142) of Neath Castle, one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan and a brother and follower of Robert FitzHamon the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. The titles Monck and Albemarle referred to the fact that the 1st Earl of Bath had been granted reversion of his cousin Monck's Dukedom of Albemarle, should the Duke have died without male progeny.Round, p.140 The title \\"Lansdown\\" referred to Lansdown Hill near Bath in Somerset where his grandfather Sir Bevil Grenville had met his heroic death at the Battle of Lansdown in 1643. The titles created on 3 November 1721 were with remainder to the heirs male of his body, whom failing to his brother, Bernard Granville, and the heirs male of his body. Marriage On 15 December 1711 in the church of St Martin-in- the-Fields in Westminster, London, he married (as her 2nd husband) Mary Villiers, the daughter of Edward Villiers, 1st Earl of Jersey (1656‚Äì1711) and the widow of Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth. Death and burial He died in London on 29 January 1735, his wife having predeceased him by a few days, and was buried with her in the Church of St Clement Danes on 3 February 1735. He left no male progeny, and thus at his death the Barony of Lansdowne became extinct. His Jacobite titles, such as they were, were inherited by his nephew Bernard Granville, son of his brother Bernard. The younger Bernard died in 1776, when the Jacobite peerages created on 3 November 1721 became extinct, while those created on 6 October 1721 passed to his heir male.Melville de Massue de Ruvigny, The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage & Grants of Honour (Edinburgh: T.C. & E.C.

History It is amongst the oldest of Stirling settlements originating in Pre-Roman times and servicing the ford marked by the Causewayhead Road. The area that is now the Cornton and on the opposite bank, the Raploch, were the only available patches of agricultural land prior to draining programs of later eras. Wallace¬¥s Battle of Stirling Bridge took place on and around the site of the present housing estate and although there is no clear marker anywhere to inform the adventurous visitor, the dominant position of the Abbey Craig indicates the natural route to the battle scene. The original bridge was anecdotally regarded as being positioned at least fifty metres up stream from the present location of the medieval bridge and archaeological dives in the last century provided evidence of the original piers of a previous bridge. Cornton is home to the only all woman's prison in Scotland, Cornton Vale. The prison, built in 1975, is located north of the housing area, close to the River Forth.

The Thundercat has since been replaced by the ZR900 in 2003 and in 2007 was replaced by the F1000 as the companies top performing model. The Arctic Cat Thundercat is a two stroke three-cylinder snowmobile which shares similar engine and performance characteristics with the Arctic Cat ZRT 800, Polaris XCR 800, and the Skidoo Mach Z 800 of the 1990s to early 2000s era. To this day, there are very few snowmobiles from any brand that can come close to the speed and performance of the Thundercat in stock form. The Thundercat set the NSSR 1000' stock class speed run record every year it was in production, a record that is still held to this day, 120.1mph.

Life Sculpture from Hildebrand's Wittelsbacher Brunnen Hildebrand was born at Marburg, the son of Marburg economics professor Bruno Hildebrand. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg, with Kaspar von Zumbusch at the Munich Academy and with Rudolf Siemering in Berlin. From 1873 he lived in Florence in the St Francesco Monastery, a secularized sixteenth-century monastery. A friend of Hans von Mar√©es, he designed the architectural setting for the painter's murals in the library of the German Marine Zoological Institute at Naples (1873). Free download available. He spent a significant amount of time in Munich after 1889, executing a monumental fountain there, the Wittelsbacher Brunnen. He is known for five monumental urban fountains and for the Bismarck monument in Bremen, unveiled in 1910. Hildebrand worked in a Neo-classical tradition, and set out his artistic theories in his book Das Problem der Form in der Bildenden Kunst (\\"The Problem of Form in Painting and Sculpture\\"), published in 1893. He was ennobled by the King of Bavaria in 1904. He died in Munich in 1921. Family In 1877 he married Irene Sch√§uffelen. They were parents of the painter Eva, Elizabeth, sculptor Irene Georgii-Hildebrand, Sylvie, Bertele, and Catholic theologian Dietrich von Hildebrand. Critical opinion In 1917, the American sculptor, conservative critic and author Lorado Taft, while bemoaning the direction the German sculpture was moving in, described Hildebrand as: > a master of the old school and Florentine tradition, whose example has been > a constant gospel of good taste and sanity. Even today, when the whole world > has gone after false gods, his influence continues to be felt and I wonder > if the fact that in the midst of this revolution German sculpture, however > fantastic, remains essentially sculpture, is not due largely to the life > long precept and practice of this admirable representative of the > craft.Taft, Lorado, ‚Äò‚ÄôModern Tendencies in Sculpture: The Scammon Lectures > at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1917‚Äô‚Äô University of Chicago Press, > Chicago, Illinois, 1922 p. 53-54 See also * Girl Playing the Lute * Girl Playing the Lyre References * World Wide Art Resources * Dietrich von Hildebrand: the Soul of a Lion, by Alice von Hildebrand (Ignatius, 2000) * Adolph von Hildebrand page * Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Vol. 11, pp 491‚Äì492 (1971) External links * Problem of Form 1901/1918 * Double Portrait of the Artist's Daughters in the collection of the J.

He was convicted of a common law misdemeanor- misconduct in office and served a 30-day sentence in county jail and received a fine. He resigned on February 1, 2013 and was succeeded by Laura Neuman, after a vote by the Anne Arundel County Council. Life John Robinson Leopold was born on February 4, 1943 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1964 he graduated from Hamilton College with a Bachelor's degree in English. Before moving to Maryland, Leopold was the first Republican elected to the Board of Education in Hawaii, where he served two years. He was also the State Director for Planned Parenthood while in Hawaii. On June 29, 1967 he was elected as Republican chairman of the 16th Representative District. In 1970 he was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives and was reelected in 1972. On January 10, 1977, Mr. Leopold was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the National Title I Advisory Committee for the Education of Disadvantaged Children. On February 25, 1991, Mr. Leopold was appointed by President George Bush to the National Council on Disability and confirmed by the United States Senate. Leopold was elected Anne Arundel County Executive on December 4, 2006, after serving 20 years in the Maryland House of Delegates. =Misconduct in office= On March 2, 2012, Leopold was indicted on multiple counts of misconduct in office for using his county-provided police security to investigate political opponents, to remove campaign signs, and to transport him to public places to engage in sexual liaisons with women. On March 7, 2012, David Holway, President of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers held a press conference in Annapolis to demand the immediate resignation of Leopold and the Chief of Police, James Teare. On January 29, 2013, Leopold was suspended from office after being found guilty on two counts of misconduct in office.

He voluntarily resigned from the office of the County Executive. In April 2019, Anne Arundel County Circuit Court denied Leopold's request to vacate his criminal conviction. Leopold based the request on the grounds that his defense attorneys represented him ineffectively, which the judge disputed in her ruling. =2018 campaign= In 2018 Leopold ran for a seat in the House of Delegates in District 31B, a two-delegate district which includes the area he previously served as a delegate.

His father Karlo Aliev conducted an orchestra that was often heard on radio Sofia. Boris Karlov (1924-1964) 'Legend of the Bulgarian Accordion' The Magic of Accordion At an early age Boris was already passionate about folk music, played first on the ocarina and later on the tambura in his father's orchestra. Here he acquired a feeling for the harmonic structure of Bulgarian music. At the age of twelve, Karlov began to play the accordion, beginning with a simple 48-bass Hohner instrument, and progressing to a 120-bass. Eventually he had an Italian Scandalli accordion custom-made for him. From 1950 to 1960, Karlov was in demand not only in Bulgaria, but also in Yugoslavia and Austria. He had a busy concert schedule and favourable reviews. Karlov developed a style of playing which was new on the accordion. Based on generally short, simple, but fast musical phrases, frequently in the irregular rhythms that were originally played on traditional Bulgarian instruments such as the gaida (bagpipe) and kaval (end-blown flute), he innovated a rondo form where the special character of Bulgarian music nevertheless remained. He died, still on tour, in Kraljevo, of a kidney infection.

The film's theme was influenced by the popularity of Disney's 1982 film Tron and the roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. Principal photography began in 1983 but the film was not completed until 1984. The film features an appearance by the heavy metal band W.A.S.P.. The film is known for the line of dialogue \\"I reject your reality and substitute my own!\\" A sequel to the movie was shot and edited in 1988, but never completed. Plot Paul Bradford (Jeffrey Byron) is a skilled computer programmer who lives with his girlfriend, Gwen (Leslie Wing), and \\"X-CaliBR8,\\" a quasi-sentient personal computer that Paul programmed and which he interacts with via a neural interface. Gwen is jealous of Paul's unusually close relationship with X-CaliBR8, to whom Paul has given a female voice, and fears that their relationship will be destroyed by Paul's reliance on X-CaliBR8 for his various day-to-day activities. One night, Paul and Gwen are both transported to a Hellish realm presided over by Mestema (Richard Moll), an ancient, demonic sorcerer who has spent millennia seeking a worthy opponent with whom to do battle. Having long defeated his enemies with magic, Mestema has become intrigued with technology, and wishes to pit his skills against Paul's, with the winner claiming Gwen. Arming Paul with a portable version of X-CaliBR8 (which takes the form of a computerized wrist band), Mestema begins transporting Paul into a variety of scenarios in which he must defeat various opponents. Most of the challenges involve Paul using his X-CaliBR8 wristband to shoot people, monsters, and objects with laser beams. After Paul completes Mestema's various challenges, the two engage in a final battle, which takes the form of a fist fight in which Paul kills Mestema by throwing him into a pit of lava. After Mestema dies, Paul and Gwen are transported back to their house, where Gwen expresses her acceptance of X-CaliBR8 and suggests that she and Paul get married.

It is owned by Variant Equity Advisors. History Coach USA traces its history back to 1922 as Lackawanna Bus and later Consolidated Bus Lines, a small outfit operating local service in Bergen County, New Jersey and later along the Jersey Shore and throughout the New York metropolitan area founded by Jim and Denis Gallagher. Community Coach, today the headquarters of Coach USA, began operations in 1958 under Denis's brother, John. The latter took over the operations of Consolidated Bus Lines, using the operating authority of another company that the Gallagher family had purchased in Paramus, New Jersey three years prior; through other acquisitions by the Gallagher family, six of these companies would become subsidiaries of Coach USA at its inception in 1995, when Frank Gallagher sold the firms to Notre Capital Ventures. At its inception, Coach USA consisted of six companies: Suburban Trails, Community Coach, Leisure Line, and Adventure Trails in New Jersey, Gray Line of San Francisco and Arrow Stage Line in Arizona (not to be confused with unaffiliated Arrow Stage Lines). Listing on the NASDAQ in 1996 under ticker TOUR, and later switching to the New York Stock Exchange under stock ticker CUI, Coach USA, under the leadership of Richard Kristinik, would expand quickly, acquiring Progressive Transportation Services Inc. a contractor of municipal transit systems in Upstate New York. Coach USA acquired additional companies throughout the United States in the next three years to expand to over 5,000 buses and many more taxicabs, as its acquisitions also included yellow cab firms throughout the United States. During this time, the Gallagher family would start another company, Student Transportation of America, based in the area of its Coast Cities operation. In 1998, Kristinik retired, and Larry King succeeded him. Stagecoach Group would purchase Coach USA in mid-1999 for $1.88 billion. Under Stagecoach ownership and the helm of Frank Gallagher, the owner of its predecessors, Coach USA sought to continue expansion, but the company, hit hard by the loss of charter business after the September 11, 2001 attacks, caused Stagecoach to crash to a loss of over ¬£524 million, at which point Stagecoach, having lost over 70 percent of its investment and now under the leadership of its founder, Brian Souter, after the downturn cost the previous CEO of Stagecoach his job, announced that all of the taxicab operations and most of Coach USA's subsidiaries were for sale, as Stagecoach sought to focus mostly on operations in the northeast, where Coach USA today maintains subsidized transit operations and scheduled service.

The contract transit division (Progressive Transportation) was sold to competitor First Transit. As a result of the sale of most of Coach USA's operations, the company's headquarters were relocated from Texas to the Community Coach garage in Paramus, New Jersey. Eight of the sold companies would be reacquired when Coach America declared bankruptcy in 2012, along with Lakefront/Hopkins in Ohio, with the intent of expanding (and in the case of California, reintroducing) the Megabus brand. Coach USA's operations today consist primarily of scheduled services in the New York and Chicago metropolitan areas, with a number of charter operations near Pittsburgh and scheduled operations in the Southern Tier of New York and southern Wisconsin, along with its Megabus operations throughout the eastern and central United States.

Early life O'Dell was born in Detroit, Michigan, in August 1923. He was raised there by his grandfather, a janitor at a public library, and his grandmother. O'Dell attended an all-black college, Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, from 1941 until 1943. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Merchant Marines, which functioned as a branch of the military forces for the duration of the conflict. During this time, he joined the National Maritime Union, one of the few racially integrated labor unions in the U.S. Communist Party During the 1950s, O'Dell was a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA).Des Griffin, The Man Behind the Myth, p. 20. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement He worked with Martin Luther King Jr. O'Dell was a director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Because of O'Dell's past involvement with the Communist Party, King received pressure from many liberal leaders‚Äîincluding the Kennedy brothers, John and Robert‚Äîto distance himself from O'Dell. Taylor Branch, historian of the civil rights era, has remarked that it was ultimately the Kennedy administration that influenced King's decision, and it wasn't a reflection of King's own feelings towards O'Dell. After conferring with King, O'Dell decided to accept a less prominent post within the movement in order not to alienate important allies of the Civil Rights struggle; nevertheless, he continued to play a decisive role in the SCLC, as well as in King's move towards the political left towards the end of his life.

Biography  Self-taught as an artist, Millares was introduced to Surrealism in 1948. In 1953, he moved to Madrid and became an abstract painter. In 1957, Millares along with other artists founded the avant-garde group El Paso (The Step) in Madrid. The members of El Paso at the time of signing the manifesto and in their first exhibitions as a group were the painters Rafael Canogar, Luis Feito, Juana Franc√©s, Manolo Millares, Manuel Rivera, Antonio Su√°rez, Antonio Saura and the sculptor Pablo Serrano. After showing his work in San Pablo in 1957, Millares' work was introduced to the United States in 1958. He attained an international reputation by the early 1960s, and had a solo show at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York in 1961.  Work  Millares, one of the most important Spanish painters of the postwar period 1945, is renowned for his spectacular collages created using a burlap sack. The burlap, sometimes colorless, was stretched, the pieces roughly sewn together to create tears and voids. His vital and body painting, in dark tones, black, white and red, splashed and flowed on the surface. Made for the first time in 1953, the jute fabrics are deeply rooted in the prehistory of the Canary Islands, in particular that of the natives, the Guanches. The embalmed corpses of this pre-Hispanic people were known to him thanks to the vast exhibitions housed at the Museo Canario de Las Palmas. Millares is associated with the informal movement, which has emphasized gestural experimentation and political engagement, and is seen as largely responsible for the revival of modern Spanish art. He developed his own visual language inspired by the pre-Hispanic people, whose organic forms painted on the walls of the caves he reconciled with the automatism of the surrealists. Millares therefore combined tradition and direct expression, prehistory and contemporary symbolism in an extremely individual way.  Career  The 1957 Ateneo de Madrid exhibition of his jute canvases and his registration for the Venice Biennale the same year earned him international recognition and the galleries Pierre Matisse and Daniel Cordier signed agreements with him in 1959. In 1960, Millares presented his first solo exhibition at the Pierre Matisse Galerie, New York. He participated in the exhibition European Art Today: 35 Painters and Sculptors at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, in 1959, and in Before Picasso: After Mir√≥ at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1960). Millares' work has been included in group exhibitions in the United States throughout his life. In 1970 he produced a film about his life and work, filmed by his wife Elvireta Escobio, which showed paintings interspersed with images of war, fascism and desolate landscapes. In Spain his work was represented since 1964 by the Galeri√° Juana Mord√≥.For more information see the Galer√≠a Juana Mord√≥ archive  Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a: One of the last exhibitions before his death in 1972 and with over 40 paintings and gouaches a comprehensive overview took place from September 24th to November 4th 1971 in the Gallery of Margarete Lauter in Mannheim in collaboration with Juana Mord√≥.Manolo Millares, Galerie Lauter, Mannheim 1971, OCLC 997464744. The paintings from Millares's last creative years were finally on view in his last exhibition during his lifetime from November 23, 1971 to January 9, 1972 in the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Posthumous exhibitions have taken place at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York (1974), at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid (1992) and at the Sen-oku Hakuko Kan Museum, Tokyo (2003).

The Klerksdorp spheres typically range in diameter from 0.5 to 10 cm. As illustrated by geologist Paul Heinrich, they vary widely in shape from either approximate or flattened spheres to well-defined discs and often are intergrown. Petrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses of specimens of these objects found that they consist either of hematite (Fe2O3) or wollastonite (CaSiO3) mixed with minor amounts of hematite and goethite (FeOOH). Observations by Cairncross and Nel and othersNel, LT., H. Jacobs, J.T. Allen and G.R. Bozzoli 1937. Wonderstone. Geological Survey of South Africa Bulletin no. 8. indicated that many of the Klerksdorp spheres found in unaltered pyrophyllite consist of pyrite (FeS2). The color of the specimens studied by Heinrich ranged from dark reddish brown, red, to dusky red. The color of those objects composed of pyrite is not known. All of the specimens of these objects, which were cut open by Heinrich, exhibited an extremely well-defined radial structure terminating on either the center or centers of a Klerksdorp sphere. Some of these objects exhibit well- defined and parallel latitudinal grooves or ridges. Even specimens consisting of intergrown flattened spheres exhibit such grooves. Geological explanation of their origin Various professional geologists agree that the Klerksdorp spheres originated as concretions, which formed in volcanic sediments, ash, or both, after they accumulated 3.0 billion years ago. Heinrich argues that the wollastonite nodules formed by the metamorphism of carbonate concretions in the presence of silica-rich fluids generated during the metamorphism of the volcanic deposits containing them into pyrophyllite. It was also argued that the hematite nodules represent pyrite concretions oxidized by weathering of near surface pyrophyllite deposits. Below the near-surface zone of weathering, which has developed in the pyrophyllite, pyrite concretions are unaffected by weathering and, thus, have not been altered to hematite. The radial internal structure of these objects is a pseudomorph after the original crystalline structure of the original carbonate or pyrite concretion. Side view of typical calcareous concretions, which exhibit equatorial grooves, found in Schoharie County, New York. The cube, for scale, is one centimeter cubed.Both Cairncross and Heinrich argue that the grooves exhibited by these concretions are natural in origin. As proposed by Cairncross, the grooves represent fine-grained laminations within which the concretions grew. The growth of the concretions within the plane of the finer-grained laminations was inhibited because of the lesser permeability and porosity of finer-grained sediments relative to the surrounding sediments. Faint internal lamina, which corresponds to exterior groove, can be seen in cut specimens. A similar process in coarser-grained sediments created the latitudinal ridges and grooves exhibited by innumerable iron oxide concretions found within the Navajo Sandstone of southern Utah called \\"Moqui marbles\\". Latitudinal grooves are also found on carbonate concretions found in Schoharie County, New York. The latitudinal ridges and grooves of the Moqui marbles are more pronounced and irregular than seen in the Klerksdorp (Ottosdal) concretions because they formed in sand that was more permeable than the fine-grained volcanic material in which the Klerksdorp (Ottosdal) concretions grew. Very similar concretions have been found within strata, as old as 2.7 to 2.8 billion years, comprising part of the Hamersley Group of Australia. The Australian concretions and the Klerksdorp spheres are among the oldest known examples of concretions created by microbial activity during the diagenesis of sedimentsLindsay, J. F., 2007, Was There a Late Archean Biospheric Explosion? Astrobiology. vol. 8, pp. 823-839. Criticism of \\"out of place\\" claims Various claims have been made that these objects are either \\"perfectly round\\" or perfect spheres. These claims are now known to be incorrect as directly observed by Heinrich. The specimens vary widely in shape, from noticeably flattened spheres to distinct disks. As illustrated by Heinrich, some of the Klerksdorp spheres are interlocked with each other, like a mass of soap bubbles. The observations and figure refute claims that these objects are either always spherical or isolated in their occurrence. Heinrich argues that even grooved spheres are not perfect spheres and some consist of interlocked spheres. Similarly, the claims that these objects consist of metal, e.g. \\"a nickel-steel alloy which does not occur naturally\\" according to Jochmans, are contradicted by Cairncross and Heinrich. The fact that many of the web pages that make this claim also incorrectly identify the pyrophyllite quarries, from which these objects came, as the \\"Wonderstone Silver Mine\\" is evidence that these authors have not verified the validity of, in this case, misinformation taken from other sources since these quarries are neither known as silver mines nor has silver ever been mined in them in the decades in which they have been in operation.Lanham, A., 2004, archive.org: New horizons for Wonderstone, Mining Weekly, December 3, 2004. Heinrich notes that one of Michael Cremo's sources regarding the allegedly anomalous spheres was the Weekly World News, a satirical tabloid, which he described as an \\"unreliable source of data for discussing the origins of the South African spheres described as used by Forbidden Archeology\\".Heinrich, P.V. 1996. The Mysterious Origins of Man: The South African Grooved Sphere Controversy: Talk.Origins Archive. According to Cairncross, it appears that the source of the Weekly World News article is an earlier article by Barritt. This article appeared in a 1982 issue of Scope magazine about these objects. Additionally, Roelf Marx, as quoted in Cairncross and Pope and Cairncross,Pope C. and B. Cairncross 1988. Cosmic Cannonballs': a geologic explanation\\". ARIP View. no. 1., pp. 5-6. (ARIP = Association for the Rational Investigation of the Paranormal) former curator of the Klerksdorp Museum, reports that he was misquoted regarding these objects. Marx was quoted in popular articles as saying that the objects rotated by themselves in vibration-free display cases in the Klerksdorp Museum. Instead, Marx stated that they rotated because of the numerous earth tremors generated by underground blasting in local gold mining. Similarly, inquiries of scientists, who studied these objects, have found that the claims that NASA found these objects to be either perfectly balanced, unnatural, or puzzling are unsubstantiated. Published descriptions of these spheres being harder than steel are meaningless in terms of Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Steel can vary from 4 to 8 on the Mohs scale, depending on the type of alloy, heat treatment, and whether it is case-hardened or not. An examination of several Klerksdorp spheres found none to be harder than 5.0 on the Mohs scale. For comparison, common glass has a Mohs hardness of 5.5.

He was a shepherd but strove to overcome his meagre education. He would often go with his father to Qom and listen to religious discourses, and he learned to read the Qur ºan. In 1847, Nab√≠l, while in the village of Rubat- Karim, overheard a conversation about the B√°b and was immediately interested. Later, when he was more fully informed of the religion of the B√°b through Siyyid Husayn-i-Zavari'i, he became a believer in the new movement. He tried to join the B√°b√≠s at Shaykh Tabarsi but the siege began before he could get there. He took up residence in Tehran in the same madrisih as the transcriber of the B√°b's writings; there he also met many B√°b√≠s who lived in or were travelling through the town, including Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In 1852 there was an attempt on the life of the Shah, which was followed by the persecution of the B√°b√≠ community. During this time, Nab√≠l put forward a claim to leadership of the B√°b√≠ community stating that he had received divine inspiration. Later, when he visited Baghdad and instead recognized Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claim, he withdrew his own. Travels From Baghdad and Adrianople, Bah√° ºu'll√°h sent Nab√≠l on numerous journeys to the B√°b√≠s of Iran. During 1867/8 his major task was to inform the B√°b√≠s of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claim to be He whom God shall make manifest. On one journey, he performed the pilgrimage to the house of the B√°b in Shiraz and the house of Bah√° ºu'll√°h in Baghdad, making him the first to perform the pilgrimage according to Bah√° ºu'll√°h's laws. In 1868 Nab√≠l was sent by Bah√° ºu'll√°h to Egypt where he was imprisoned. When he was freed, Nab√≠l journeyed to  ªAkk√°, but after being recognized by the followers of Azal who had stationed themselves near the gate of the city, he was removed from the city. He travelled around the area including living on Mount Carmel and in Nazareth until he was able to enter  ªAkk√°. On his second attempt to enter the prison city he was able to stay 81 days, meeting M√≠rz√° √Åq√° J√°n and then Bah√° ºu'll√°h. After this, he was sent by Bah√° ºu'll√°h again to Iran to confirm the belief of many of the Bah√° º√≠s. In 1888 he began writing The Dawn-Breakers with the personal assistance of M√≠rz√° M√∫s√°, the brother of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. It was finished in about a year and a half, and parts of the manuscript were reviewed and approved, some by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and others by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Death After his return from Iran, he lived in  ªAkk√° until Bah√° ºu'll√°h's death in 1892. Overwhelmed with Bah√° ºu'll√°h's death, he drowned himself in the sea and his dead body was found washed ashore near the city of  ªAkk√°. Besides writing a lengthy history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, he wrote poetry about the historical events of the religion, which he would send to the Bah√° º√≠s of Iran. His poetry, however, has not been published. A tablet by Bah√° ºu'll√°h addresses him by name, describing him as \\"numbered with My favoured ones whose names the Finger of God hath inscribed.\\" Notes References  * External links * Category:Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h Category:Iranian Bah√°'√≠s Category:Bah√°'√≠ poets Category:Suicides by drowning Category:1831 births Category:1892 deaths Category:19th-century Bah√°'√≠s ","title":"Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam"},{"id":"3880087","title":"9th Street‚ÄìCongress Street station"},{"id":"3880122","title":"2nd Street station (Hudson‚ÄìBergen Light Rail)"},{"id":"3880124","text":"Chelfham Viaduct is a railway viaduct built in 1896‚Äì97 to carry the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway (L&B;) across the Stoke Rivers valley.

The viaduct, however, was not sold. In 1943, it featured as a location in the war-time film The Flemish Farm, representing a Franco-Spanish border crossing. It is probable that such a redundant structure would normally have been dismantled, either then, or shortly afterwards during the Second World War, as happened to the smaller viaduct at Lancey Brook, which was destroyed as a demolition training exercise by the Army. However, a school and other buildings at its base made it uneconomical to dismantle, so it remained in Southern Railway ownership, passing to British Railways on the nationalisation of the railways in Britain in 1948, and in 2001, to BRB (Residuary) Ltd, formally a wholly owned subsidiary of the Strategic Rail Authority (now Network Rail).

These assets, together with any related contingent liabilities, are included in the Department for Transport‚Äôs accounts.\\" Restoration In 2000, the viaduct was extensively restored, including the fitting of a waterproof membrane to the deck, improvements to rainwater drainage, and restoration of the parapets, leaving the structure once again ready to carry rail transport. The project was funded by BRB and the Railway Heritage Trust. The Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Trust- which owns the nearby railway station - helped fund the restoration of the parapets and the upgrading of the waterproof membrane as part of long-term plans to reopen the line.

Terje Vigen is a poem written by Henrik Ibsen, published in 1862. Much of the story and setting is from the area around the town of Grimstad in southern Norway where Ibsen lived for a few years in his youth. It describes the dramatic saga of Terje who, in 1809, tried to run the British blockade of Norway's southern coast in a small rowboat in a desperate attempt to smuggle food from Denmark back to his starving wife and daughter. He was captured and imprisoned on a British prison hulk and released in 1814 after the Napoleonic Wars were over, only to find that his family had died. He became a pilot, and years later rescued an English lord who turned out to be the commander of the ship that had captured him. The denouement, as in most Ibsen works, should be understood by reading the original (links provided below). Inspiration In Grimstad Ibsen was inspired by the stories of the Norse maritime pilots. He became a close friend to one of the oldest and most experienced pilots, who had lived a remarkable life and had exciting stories to tell the young writer. His name was Svend Hanssen Haa√∏, from the island of Haa√∏ (in modern Norwegian H√•√∏ya). The story of his life is often thought to be an important source for Ibsen when he wrote his famous poem Terje Vigen. See article \\"Who was Terje Vigen?\\"http://www.oftebro.com/Terje_Vigen_english.pdf Svend Hanssen Haa√∏'s life contains many of the essential elements of the story of Terje Vigen. Haa√∏ made several trips by rowboat to Denmark through the British blockade, in the years 1807-14, to smuggle food back to his family and friends in Grimstad. The British captured him as many as four times, and some of his crew were put to prison in England as in the poem. It is well documented that Henrik Ibsen and Svend Hanssen Haa√∏ became close friends. They made a lot of visits to each other, both at Svend‚Äôs house at the Haa√∏ Island, and in Ibsen‚Äôs department at Grimstad Pharmacy. Henrik Ibsen never revealed if he had a model when he wrote the story of Terje Vigen. However, the most important specialists on Henrik Ibsen‚Äôs life in Grimstad, were convinced that Ibsen‚Äôs friendship with Svend and Svend‚Äôs remarkable life as a pilot at the coast was the most important inspiration for Ibsen. Ibsen painted Svend sitting at Haa√∏ Island. The painting is called The Pilot from Haa√∏ Island.http://ibsen.nb.no/image/14585/1/14585_1.jpeg This painting is placed in Ibsen's house in Grimstad, and is owned by Grimstad Museum. Reception In his biography of Ibsen, Edmund Gosse indicates: :\\"He was perhaps momentarily saved by the publication of Terje Vigen, which enjoyed a solid popularity. This is the principal and, indeed, almost the only instance in Ibsen's works of what the Northern critics call \\"epic,\\" but what we less ambitiously know as the tale in verse. Terje Vigen will never be translated successfully into English, for it is written, with brilliant lightness and skill, in an adaptation of the Norwegian ballad-measure which it is impossible to reproduce with felicity in our language.\\" :\\"Among Ibsen's writings Terje Vigen is unique as a piece of pure sentimentality carried right through without one divagation into irony or pungency. It is the story of a much- injured and revengeful Norse pilot, who, having the chance to drown his old enemies, Milord and Milady, saves them at the mute appeal of their blue-eyed English baby. Terje Vigen is a masterpiece of what we may define as the \\"dash- away-a-manly- tear\\" class of narrative. It is extremely well written and picturesque, but the wonder is that, of all people in the world, Ibsen should have written it.\\"Biography of Henrik Ibsen by Edmund Gosse on Project Gutenberg. The poem and the character of Terje Vigen has become a core icon of Norwegian coastal culture and a sense of a national identity. Every year the poem is read at festivals and included in dance and music performances. Best known are the wood boat festival at Ris√∏r and the Ibsen festival in Grimstad. Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, NRK, broadcasts on the radio a reading of Terje Vigen on New Year's Eve at midnight. Notable Adaptations In 1917, Victor Sj√∂str√∂m directed an eponymous Swedish film based on the poem, retitled A Man There Was in English-speaking territories. A German remake of 1933, Das Meer ruft aka The Lake Calls, starred Heinrich George and was set on a fictional Baltic island under Russian occupation during the First World War. The Norwegian composer Guttorm Guttormsen wrote his Terje Vigen for bass soloist and orchestra in 1977. In 1994/5, Jon Mostad wrote music for Terje Vigen for recitation, choir (SSA) and symphonic wind band. Film maker Torstein Blixfjord directed a major multimedia adaptation in Yokohama, Japan in November 2006.http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=11140249&subid;=0 The production involved a film projected across five cinema screens set up on Shinko Pier, which was accompanied by dancers. The film featured the poem narrated by Masato Ibu. The project formed the basis of Blixfjord's 2008/9 project Id - Identity of the Soul, which also featured contributions from the great Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish. Also in 2006, composer and producer Kjell- Ole Haune developed Terje Vigen into a multi media musical. This production went on tour in Norway and USA in 2006 and 2007 and was staged in London's West End in 2008.

A Faema Professional espresso machine FAEMA (Italian acronym: Fabbrica Apparecchiature Elettromeccaniche e Affini) primarily engaged in the production of espresso machines, was founded in 1945 by Carlo Ernesto Valente, in Milan, Italy.Faema History, Faema, Italy. Faema was to become synonymous with the post-war production boom in Italy, by actively pursuing technological innovation as the company's driving force.  Company history  In the 1950s, Faema began with horizontal boiler, lever piston machines, which were typical of the time. In 1961, however, Faema released the E61, an espresso machine introducing many 'firsts' which are still commonly found in most espresso machines. The most significant was the delivery of pressurized water through a mechanical pump at approximately 9 bar (130.5 pounds per square inch), replacing the piston-lever designs of the 1950s. Faema circumvented the problem of running heated water through the pump, by running cold water through the pump, through a heat exchange tube through the steam boiler to flash heat the water, before entering the diffusion block and through the ground coffee to create an espresso. Faema also introduced a new grouphead that was kept warm by circulating water from the boiler through the grouphead in a thermosyphon circuit. The grouphead was activated by a lever, which when partially open, allows the release of pressure created from the municipal water line. That pressure soaked the coffee with brew-temperature water, allowing for a smoother extraction. When the lever is fully raised, the pump is activated and the coffee is extracted at full pressure. The implications of the technological innovation of the E61 was revolutionary, and allowed Faema to acquire a significant espresso machine market share within years. Faema recently reintroduced a replica model for commercial use. Another impact of the E61 is in the home espresso machine market. A generic replica version of the E61 grouphead, coupled with the heat exchange boiler has become popularized in Europe, North America, and Australia. While the aesthetic appeal of the E61 group is cited as a reason for its popularity, the grouphead paired with a heat exchange boiler also created a new level of home espresso quality for consumers. Cycling team Faema has a long history of sponsoring cycling teams. They have acted as the main or sole sponsor of numerous cycling teams for many years, but also as co-sponsor. The best-known rider competing for a team sponsored by Faema was 5-time Tour de France champion Eddy Merckx.68's Faema team comprising Eddy Merckx See also  * Bialetti * Cimbali * De'Longhi * Elektra (espresso machines) * FrancisFrancis * Gaggia * La Marzocco * Rancilio * Saeco * List of Italian companies References External links *FAEMA website *The Benefits of an E61 Group Head Category:Coffee appliance vendors Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1945 Category:Cooking appliance brands Category:Home appliance brands Category:Home appliance manufacturers of Italy Category:Manufacturing companies based in Milan Category:Espresso machines Category:1945 establishments in Italy Category:Italian brands Category:Cimbali Category:Coffee in Italy ","title":"Faema"},{"id":"3880193","text":"Imperial Palace of Goslar The term Kaiserpfalz (, \\"imperial palace\\") or K√∂nigspfalz (, \\"royal palace\\", from Middle High German phal[en]ze to Old High German phalanza from Middle Latin palatia [plural] to Latin palatium \\"palace\\"Eintrag Pfalz in Duden online) refers to a number of castles and palaces across the Holy Roman Empire that served as temporary, secondary seats of power for the Holy Roman Emperor in the Early and High Middle Ages. The term was also used more rarely for a bishop who, as a territorial lord (Landesherr), had to provide the king and his entourage with board and lodging, a duty referred to as Gastungspflicht.  Origin of the name  Kaiserpfalz is a German word that is a combination of Kaiser, meaning \\"emperor\\", which is derived from \\"caesar\\"; and Pfalz, meaning \\"palace\\", and itself derived from the Latin palatium, meaning the same (see palace). Likewise K√∂nigspfalz is a combination of K√∂nig, \\"king\\", and Pfalz, meaning \\"royal palace\\".  Description and purpose  Artist's impression of the K√∂nigspfalz at Aachen Like their peers in France and England, the medieval emperors of the Holy Roman Empire did not rule from a capital city, but had to maintain personal contact with their vassals on the ground. This was so-called \\"itinerant kingship\\"; a sort of \\"travelling kingdom\\" (Reisek√∂nigtum). Because pfalzen were built and used by the king as a ruler within the Holy Roman Empire (rex Romanorum (R√∂mischer K√∂nig)), the correct historical term is K√∂nigspfalz or \\"royal palace\\". The term Kaiserpfalz is a 19th-century appellation that overlooks the fact that the king did not bear the title of the Roman Emperor (granted by the Pope) until after his imperial coronation. Unlike a pfalz, where the itinerant ruler enacted his sovereign duties, a royal estate or K√∂nigshof is only an economic estate owned by the king, which was only occasionally used by the king on his itinerary.Michael Gockel: Karolingische K√∂nigsh√∂fe am Mittelrhein. Verlag Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen, 1970. Unlike the common notion of \\"palace\\", a pfalz was not a permanent residence but a place where the emperor stayed for a certain time, usually less than a year; itineraries suggest that the monarch rarely would stay for longer than a few weeks. Moreover, they were not always grand palaces in the accepted sense: some were small castles or fortified hunting lodges, such as Bodfeld in the Harz. But in the main they were large manor houses (Gutsh√∂fe), that offered catering and accommodation for the king and his many retainers, often running to hundreds of staff, as well as numerous guests and their horses. In Latin, such a royal manor was known as a villa regia or curtis regia. They were located either near the bishop's residences, near important abbeys, near towns the king held or in the countryside in the middle of royal estates. Pfalzen were generally built at intervals of 30 kilometres, which represented a day's journey by horse at that time. At a minimum, a pfalz consisted of a palas with its Great Hall or Aula Regia, an imperial chapel (Pfalzkapelle) and an estate (Gutshof). It was here that kings and emperors carried out the business of state, held their imperial court sessions and celebrated important church festivals. Each was administered by a count palatine, who executed jurisdiction in the emperor's stead. One of the most important of them would eventually rise to the title of Prince-elector. The pfalzen that the rulers visited varied depending on their function. Especially important were those palaces in which the kings spent the winter (winter palaces or Winterpfalzen), and the festival palaces (Festtagspfalzen), Easter being the most important and celebrated at Easter palaces (Osterpfalzen). The larger palaces were often in towns that had special rights (e.g. imperial immediacy), but could also be bishop's seats or imperial abbeys. In the Hohenstaufen era of the Roman-German kingdom, important imperial princes began to demonstrate their claims to power by building their own pfalzen. Important examples of these include Henry the Lion's Dankwarderode Castle in Brunswick and the Wartburg above Eisenach in Thuringia. Both buildings followed the basic design of Hohenstaufen pfalzen and also had the same dimensions.

The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest, p. 81 footnote; Pellegrini & Cudahy, New York, 1952 Life Rigby was born circa 1570 at Harrock Hall, Wrightington, Lancashire (near Chorley, Lancashire), the fifth or sixth son of Nicholas Rigby, by his wife Mary (n√©e Breres). In 1600 Rigby was working as a steward for Sir Edmund Huddleston. Sir Edmund sent him to the sessions house of the Old Bailey to plead illness for the absence of his daughter, the widow Mrs. Fortescue, who had been summoned on a charge of recusancy. A commissioner then questioned Rigby about his own religious beliefs. Rigby acknowledged that he was Catholic, and was sent to Newgate. The next day, the feast day of St Valentine, he signed a confession saying that since he had been reconciled to the Roman Catholic faith by Saint John Jones, a Franciscan priest, in the Clink some two or three years previously, he had not attended Anglican services. He was sent back to Newgate and later transferred to the White Lion. Twice he was given the chance to recant, but twice refused. He told the judge that his sentence for treason \\"is the thing which I desire\\". His sentence was carried out. He gave the executioner who helped him up to the cart a piece of gold, saying, \\"Take this in token that I freely forgive thee and others that have been accessory to my death.\\"Stanton, Richard, A Menology of England and Wales, Burns & Oates, ltd., London, 1892 Rigby was hanged, drawn and quartered at St Thomas Waterings on 21 June 1600.

Here is the moment where free media, such as ours must be active. We speak for the ideas of... a United Europe.\\" In the letter, Dekan also raised his concerns that European integration was least supported by the youngest generation of Poles and vowed to take appropriate action, suggesting \\"Let's tell them what to do to stay in the fast lane and not end in the parking lot.\\"  Competitors  Major competitors in the German publishing market include Bauer Media Group, Bertelsmann, Hubert Burda Media, and Holtzbrinck.

Although the Remains never achieved national success, they were very popular in New England, and were one of the opening acts on the Beatles' final US tour in 1966. The Remains broke up in 1966, but their music eventually attracted a strong international cult following. They began performing and recording again in the late 1990s, and have continued to play regularly since then. Career, 1960s The Remains formed in 1964 at Boston University, where all four members were first-year students living in the same dorm in Kenmore Square. Singer-guitarist Barry Tashian and keyboardist Bill Briggs were from Westport, Connecticut, drummer Chip Damiani from Wolcott, Connecticut, and bassist Vern Miller from Livingston, New Jersey. They began playing r&b; and rock'n'roll covers, as well as some Tashian originals, at The Rathskeller, a tavern across the square from their dorm. Soon, fans were lining up from Kenmore Square to Fenway Park to see them, and management had to clear out a disused basement to accommodate the crowds. The band became a popular live act throughout New England and appeared on the CBS TV program The Ed Sullivan Christmas Show of 1965. After signing with Epic Records, they enjoyed local hits with a catchy, swinging Tashian original, \\"Why Do I Cry\\", and their hard- driving version of the Bo Diddley/Willie Dixon classic \\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\". In 1965 the Remains relocated to New York City‚Äîwhere they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show‚Äîand then, after about a year, moved on to California. They recorded an album, The Remains, appeared on NBC TV's 'Hullabaloo', and released the soulful, hard-rocking single \\"Don't Look Back\\". In 1966 came the opportunity which might have broken the band nationally, but proved instead to be their last hurrah: they were offered a three-week stint as an opening act for the Beatles, on what would turn out to be the Fab Four's final tour. Immediately before the tour, drummer Chip Damiani quit the band, to be replaced by future Mountain drummer N.D. Smart. Said Tashian in a 2012 interview: \\"We had always been the four of us and we‚Äôd played hundreds and hundreds of gigs as the four of us and all of a sudden this big tour comes up and boom! We have to play it with a new drummer who didn‚Äôt have the same feel that Chip had. I mean he was a fine drummer but it wasn‚Äôt the same band. I just felt like the flame was burning down without our original drummer.\\" The band broke up in late 1966, and Epic released their self-titled debut album to little fanfare. Resurgence In common with many of their garage rock contemporaries, the Remains gradually acquired cult status, and eventually reformed to play at several garage revival shows, such as Cavestomp in New York City in 1998, Las Vegas Grind in 2000 and a tour of major European cities in 2006. They recorded a new album, Movin' On, in 2002. Although now associated with the garage rock genre, the Remains were highly accomplished professional musicians and their recordings, while hard-edged, were notably well-produced and arranged. The band's last single, \\"Don't Look Back\\", written by Billy Vera, was featured on the 1972 compilation album Nuggets: Original Artyfacts From the First Psychedelic Era, which garnered further attention with its 1976 re-release by Sire Records, concurrent with a surge of interest in punk rock and 60s garage rock. A later box set version of the album also includes the Remains' first single, \\"Why Do I Cry\\" \\"Why Do I Cry\\" is featured briefly in the film Superbad (2007), when the character McLovin is being taken to a party in a police car. In 2007, Epic/Legacy came out with a reissue of the Remains' 1966 album, which received the following review from rock journalist Mark Kemp in Paste magazine (June 2007): \\"Had these Boston bad boys stuck it out beyond their 1966 debut, we might today be calling them‚Äîand not the Stones‚Äîthe World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band. As it is, the Remains most certainly are America's greatest lost band.\\" Kemp's praise echoed the critique written 40 years earlier by rock critic (and subsequent Bruce Springsteen manager) Jon Landau, in Crawdaddy! magazine (January 1967): \\"They were how you told a stranger about rock'n'roll.\\" In 2008 a documentary about the Remains, America's Lost Band, directed by Michael Stich, premiered at the Boston Film Festival. Steve Simels of Boxoffice magazine described the film as \\"a fascinating retelling of one of the great what-might-have-been stories of American music of the '60s.\\" The Remains' story was also the subject of a stage musical at the 2004 New York International Fringe Festival, \\"All Good Things,\\" which received acclaim from a variety of critics. (60sgaragebands.com, News & Nuggets, August 31, 2004). In 2010 the Remains released \\"Monbo Time\\", a tribute to 1960s Boston Red Sox pitcher Bill Monbouquette, with revenues going to cancer research. On February 23, 2014, Rudolph \\"Chip\\" Damiani died of a cerebral haemorrhage.

It is named for Alice Tully, a New York performer and philanthropist whose donations assisted in the construction of the hall. Tully Hall is located within the Juilliard Building, a Brutalist structure, which was designed by renowned architect Pietro Belluschi, and completed and opened in 1969. Since its opening, it has hosted numerous performances and events, including the New York Film Festival. Tully Hall seats 1,086 patrons. As part of the Lincoln Center 65th Street Development Project, the Juilliard School and Tully Hall underwent a major renovation and expansion by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro and FXFOWLE completed in 2009. The building utilizes new interior materials, state-of-the- art technologies, and updated equipment for concerts, film, theater, and dance. The expansion of the Juilliard Building created a three-story all-glass lobby and sunken plaza beneath a new, cantilevered extension, ‚Äúprojecting a newly visible public identity to Broadway.‚Äù History =Context and construction= Before the construction of Alice Tully Hall, most of the chamber music performances in New York City were held at The Town Hall on West 43rd Street, which had been built in 1921. The founders of Lincoln Center wished to have a chamber music hall in the complex, as there was still a need for a dedicated space. Before construction on Lincoln Center began, the architects considered placing a chamber music hall in the basement of Philharmonic Hall (since renamed David Geffen Hall, formerly Avery Fisher Hall). However, as the Juilliard School needed a concert hall that was equal in size to a chamber music hall, Lincoln Center decided to build one in the Juilliard building. Construction on the Juilliard building began in 1965 ‚Äî on a site one block north of the original Lincoln Center complex and part of the parcel designated for improvement through urban renewal. The cost of the chamber music hall was approximately $4.2 million, all of which was covered by donations from Alice Tully, a New York chamber music patron and former singer. Tully Hall was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi, and associate architects Eduardo Catalano and Helge Westermann. Renowned acoustician Heinrich Keilholz designed the hall's acoustics. Alice Tully played an influential role in the design of the hall. \\"She was very, very particular and meticulous about her choices of colors and what she wanted in the hall that would bear her name,\\" said Patrick McGinnis, former director of operations and manager of Alice Tully Hall, in a 1992 interview. Tully also insisted on there being ample space between the rows of seats, allowing concertgoers of all heights to be comfortable. =Opening, use and renovation= Alice Tully Hall and the Juilliard School at night. Tully Hall opened on September 11, 1969. Its opening night showcased the first concert of the new Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society. The New York Times praised the ‚Äúrestrained, elegant interior‚Äù of basswood, deep lavender carpeting, and raspberry seats,‚Äù and Mildred Schmertz of Architectural Record stated that Alice Tully Hall and the other auditoriums in the Juilliard School building ‚Äúprove that it is possible to create elegant halls in contemporary terms without resorting to skimpy evocations of the gilt, plaster, and crystal d√©cor of the great halls of the past.‚Äù Since its opening, Tully Hall has served as a venue for numerous events, including Mostly Mozart, Great Performers, the New York Film Festivals, and Jazz at Lincoln Center. In 1975, a cathedral-sized, 4,192-pipe organ was installed. In April 2004, Lincoln Center unveiled the designs by Diller Scofidio + Renfro (who were selected as the project's design architect in 2003) and FXFOWLE for the first phase of its redevelopment project, which included the expansion of the Juilliard building and the redesign of Alice Tully Hall. The plan received final approval and construction began in March 2006. The plan was praised by many architecture critics, but it also received criticism from preservationists who wished to see the original Belluschi building remain intact. A 2005 proposal for landmark status was declined by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Docomomo International, an organization that works to protect twentieth-century Modernist buildings and sites was a leading organization protesting the renovation. The majority of the controversy has been focused on changes being made to other parts of Lincoln Center, in phase two of the redevelopment project. By June 2006, Lincoln Center, Inc. had raised $339 million, 75% of the $459 million it was responsible for raising for the project. The total goal for the project was $650 million, and the remainder of the money was provided by the federal government and the governments of New York City and State.Lincoln Center: June 12, 2006 Press Release. Lincoln Center also received 20 gifts of $5 million or more, nine of which were at $10 million and above. Donors were represented among individuals, corporations, and foundations, including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and Bank of New York Mellon. Construction was completed and Tully Hall was re-opened in February 2009 with a two-week opening celebration. The Juilliard expansion and renovation was projected to cost around $100 million, but is reported to have cost as much as $360 million, no official numbers have been released. The entire West 65th Street project was projected to cost $325 million. Charles Renfro, a partner at Diller Scofidio + Renfro, stated that the sum was probably twice as high as it would have cost to tear down Belluschi's building and build anew. Architect Alice Tully Hall was designed as part of the Juilliard School building by Pietro Belluschi. Belluschi became involved with the Lincoln Center project in October 1956, when he participated in a two-week conference devoted to discussing the planning of the center.Clausen, Meredith L. Pietro Belluschi: Modern American Architect. 1994. The MIT Press The president of the Juilliard School consulted with Belluschi on which architect to choose for the project, and though Belluschi had submitted a list of architects to be considered, he was ultimately chosen as the building's architect. He associated with Eduardo Catalano and Helge Westermann. Westermann had established an office in New York, which Belluschi and Catalano used as a local liaison for the project. The project had been put on hold, pending decisions on the final site and budget, but went forward in 1963. Tired of battling budget restrictions and changing program requirements, Belluschi and Catalano had difficulty generating new plans when the project restarted. Several of their previously proposed plans were turned over to Robert Burns, Frederick Taylor, and Frederick Preis, three employees at Catalano's office. Burns‚Äô plan was based heavily off Catalano's MIT Student Center (completed in 1965). Catalano was regularly available for guidance and criticism on the project, whereas Belluschi would only stop in occasionally to review the work of Catalano's office. Belluschi played a more public role, communicating with Juilliard and with donors. He also was highly involved in designing spaces like the performance hall lobbies and foyers. Over the course of 12 years, the architectural team had developed approximately 70 sets of preliminary drawings.Robert A. M. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman.

Diller Scofidio + Renfro were chosen in 2003 as the design architects to redevelop Lincoln Center's 65th Street corridor, after defeating Norman Foster, Richard Meier, and Santiago Calatrava in a 2002 design competition. The plan envisioned transforming West 65th Street into a ‚ÄúStreet of the Arts,‚Äù making it a more pedestrian-friendly environment. Elizabeth Diller, partner-in-charge of the project, ‚Äúimagined a Lincoln Center that is more Lincoln Center than Lincoln Center.‚Äù Design =Site= Alice Tully Hall, seen from Broadway The Juilliard School building sits along the west side of Broadway, between 65th and 66th Streets (across the street from Avery Fisher Hall and the Lincoln Center parking garage). Prior to its expansion, it maintained a rectangular footprint of approximately 200 x . Also, prior to the re-development project, the building's primary means of connection to the main Lincoln Center complex was a large pedestrian footbridge (named the Paul Milstein Plaza) that crossed over‚Äîand covered a large portion of‚ÄîWest 65th Street. Despite the original building's shape, its site was rhomboidal in shape, due to the diagonal progression of Broadway through the rigid orthogonal grid of Manhattan. Rejecting Broadway's diagonal, the architects oriented Juilliard to the grid, using the remaining triangular section as a small plaza. Though not located on the complex's superblock between West 62nd and 65th Streets, the architects identified the original Juilliard building with Lincoln Center through the footbridge connection and use of cladding. Gordon Bunshaft originally envisioned the bridge to better integrate Juilliard with the main Lincoln Center campus and hide street traffic. Little to no consideration was given regarding the effects of such a wide bridge on the street below.Ballon, Hillary and Jackson, Kenneth T. Robert Moses and the Modern City: The Transformation of New York. 2007. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. As Juilliard's main public theater, Alice Tully Hall was not given a prominent entrance, despite the fact that it was housed in the only Lincoln Center building on a site directly facing Broadway. The entrance was instead tucked under the second-story outdoor terrace/footbridge and the monumental exterior staircase that led up to it from the plaza. This, the rejection of the diagonal, and the setting back of the building from Broadway, follow a similar logic of detachment from the city street that the main Lincoln Center campus embodied. This original entrance to Tully Hall became fully visible only once the terrace, staircase, and footbridge were removed in 2006. =Architecture= Exterior In keeping with the Brutalist style, Juilliard features rigorous geometries and highly cantilevered forms. Initial studies by Pietro Belluschi and Eduardo Catalano related more toward the white classical temple image adopted for the other Lincoln Center buildings. As the studies progressed and the site moved to the lot between West 65th and 66th Streets, there was an administrative shift at the Juilliard School. The new president expanded the curriculum and altered the program of the school. In response to these changes in both site and program, the design, ultimately constructed, was the Robert Burns scheme fashioned off the MIT Student Center. The scheme is based on the placement of main performance spaces on either side of a central vertical circulation core. At a cost of nearly $30 million in 1969, the building contained: 10 floors (4 above ground, 4 below), 3 Juilliard theaters, the public Alice Tully Hall, 15 large dance, opera, and drama studios, 3 organ studios, 84 practice rooms, 27 classrooms and ensemble studios, 30 private instruction studios, numerous orchestra and choral rehearsal rooms, scenery and costume studios and workshops, a library, lounge, snack bar, and administration offices. The theaters and working floors are tied together by a West 65th Street vestibule-lobby that rises several stories, allowing one to orient oneself upon entering the building. The arrangement and packing of a campus‚Äô worth of spaces into a single building greatly impressed architectural critics, but was not as well received by the students of Juilliard, who were confused by the building's circulation. The Juilliard building, set on a regular structural grid, was designed in steel and concrete with a travertine veneer (for which the material was donated by the Italian government). However, the public entrance to Alice Tully Hall under the second-story terrace and exterior staircase is difficult to find. The removal of the West 65th Street footbridge, in 2006, unveiled this entrance, but it did not attain full prominence until the renovation and expansion of Tully Hall and Juilliard. Interior Most of the building's interior was extremely simple, with walls often left as bare concrete aggregate with wall-to-wall carpeting on the floors in several areas. The theaters, on the other hand, were far more finely detailed. Tully Hall was (in accordance with the desires of Alice Tully herself) designed with wood batten with dampening behind, and lavender carpet ‚Äúcasting 1930s-ish mauve lights in the foyer.‚Äù Though the theater's lobby was large, it was depressed several feet below grade. The theater was designed mainly for recitals and chamber music performances, but because the first three rows of seats could be replaced by an expanded stage, it could also accommodate small orchestras. Tully Hall is located within of the subway tunnel under Broadway, and this required the insertion of a one-inch-thick, cork-lined asbestos pad between the theater's foundation and bedrock, as well as the isolation of the theater's walls from structural columns. Tully Hall's acoustics were praised as being among the best of any performance hall in Lincoln Center, thanks to the work of acoustician Heinrich Keilholz (who consulted on the acoustics of the entire building as well). After its renovation, Tully Hall's lobby doubled in size from , with a patron's salon added on the mezzanine level. A public caf√© named at65 is visible in the lobby along Broadway, backed by blood-red walls of tongue-and-groove muirapiranga wood, which now wrap the new performance hall (renamed the Starr Theater). The lobby's floors are made of Portuguese ataija azul limestone. The east and south elevations are sheathed with a mullionless one-way-cable wall system, allowing for maximum transparency. Narrow passageways lead to the side entrances of the concert hall. The passageway walls are lined with dark gray felt and the floors are covered with gray industrial carpeting. Elisabeth Diller calls this the ‚Äúsensory deprivation space‚Äù, as it is meant to heighten the drama of coming into the auditorium. The theater's new skin consists almost entirely of translucent eco-friendly resin and African moabi wood panels that were developed with 3form (and are between 1 and 1.5 inches thick). The panels form gill-like acoustic baffles along the side walls or become pivoting pyramid shapes that bounce sound. Sections of the balcony and side walls give emit a soft pinkish light as LEDs hidden behind them glow through the superthin moabi veneer. Aesthetics, acoustics, and lighting were all incorporated into these panels to remove visual clutter and create a more inviting space. The stage can now be configured in three different ways, as the front rows are capable of sliding down and underneath it. Renovation The new outdoor plaza and entry to Alice Tully Hall. As part of the Lincoln Center Redevelopment Project, the Juilliard School needed another of space and wanted Alice Tully Hall's interiors and public spaces to be more welcoming. The expansion by Diller Scofidio + Renfro and FXFOWLE extended the travertine cladding of the original building along the West 65th Street facade, and also created an adapted extension of the Brutalist geometries on the upper stories. The fourth-story row of recesses housing windows is extended, but with the glass displaced and extending beyond the recesses, differentiating the extension from the original building and subtly beginning to break the original Brutalist box. The Juilliard extension cantilevers over a sunken public plaza and a new 38-foot-6-inch-high glazed lobby. The underside of the extension tilts up at a 16-degree angle. A dance studio punches through the curtain wall, overlooking Broadway. The transparency of the entry makes it feel like an extension of the Broadway sidewalk. A grandstand of bleacher-style seating on the far corner of the plaza rises at a similar angle to the canopy. Structural glazed walls bring daylight into three stories of rehearsal space and classrooms in the extension, and the protruding dance studio is suspended beneath its soffit. East-west running trusses were installed between the third and sixth levels to carry the load for the four floors of the expansion, the longest of which has a back span with a cantilever. Some of the trusses‚Äô diagonals needed to be offset to accommodate doors, passageways, and other obstructions. Steel diagonal brace frames extend from the ground to the roof to support the lateral load. Acoustician Mark Holden and his team measured every surface of the old performance hall to determine which were re-radiating the noise of the subway, and found that the stage and seating floors, and proscenium stage's vertical panels were the responsible members. The new floors sit on a floating concrete slab with a rubber pad, and the spin walls are mounted on giant rubber isolators, which work to mitigate the sounds of the subway. =Significance= Elizabeth Diller called Lincoln Center the ‚Äúplace that architects love to hate,‚Äù but said that DS+R wanted to give it a ‚Äúsecond chance.‚Äù It had long been criticized by the architectural community, due to the general dissatisfaction with the complex's overall feeling of detachment from its urban environment (the consequence of an antiquated architectural and planning ideology), the unsavory forms of the main theatre buildings, and the inadequacies of the actual performance spaces. The Juilliard Building, by comparison, received far more favorable reviews, especially with regard to its performance spaces. Despite its improvements over the superblock buildings, it was not without its problems: no clear, distinct public entrance for Tully Hall, the massive exterior stair and footbridge, lack of engagement with Broadway (either its social vitality and unique diagonal shape). The expansion of Juilliard and the comprehensive renovation of Alice Tully Hall resolve many of the original building's issues, meeting the program requirements of the Juilliard School while actively engaging the once-reclusive Juilliard building with Broadway and Lincoln Square, making it an integral part of the area's vibrant street life. Furthermore, the expansion and renovation successfully merge the Brutalist/Modernist language of the original building with the contemporary Post-Modernist language of the addition. It is this Post-Modern language that interacts most with the streetscape, reflecting contemporary ideas regarding the creation of public space and the relationship/transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. The new Tully Hall and Juilliard building has received rave reviews, with critics who liked the original building praising the architects for ‚Äúpulling off the near-impossible feat of improving a good building without subverting its finer traits.‚Äù See also * List of concert halls References External links Alice Tully Hall Seating Chart Category:Juilliard School Category:1969 establishments in New York (state) Category:Music venues in Manhattan Category:New York City nightlife Category:Lincoln Center Category:Pietro Belluschi buildings ","title":"Alice Tully Hall"},{"id":"3880271","title":"Exchange Place station (Hudson‚ÄìBergen Light Rail)"},{"id":"3880287","text":"Troy Byer (born November 7, 1964) is an American psychologist, author, director, screenwriter and actress.

He was succeeded by Samir Radwan on 31 January 2011. Education Youssef Boutros-Ghali was born in Cairo on 20 August 1952. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in economics at Cairo University in 1974. He then earned a Doctor of Philosophy in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981. He was also a lecturer and research assistant during his stay at MIT. His uncle, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was Secretary- General of the United Nations from 1992 to 1996. Career Upon graduation, Boutros-Ghali joined the International Monetary Fund as an EP (Economist Program). He became Senior Economist. He worked in both area and functional departments: first in the Middle East Department (MED) and later in Policy and Development Review (PDR) on Asian, Latin American and Middle Eastern countries. He gained profound knowledge of the economic problems and policy challenges of countries as diverse as the Sudan, Ivory Coast, the Philippines, China, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico. He also did background work on the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s. After leaving the Fund in 1986, Boutros-Ghali was appointed as Economic Advisor to Egypt's Prime Minister and to the Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (1986‚Äì1993), where he took a prominent role in negotiating the 1987 and 1991 stand-by arrangements with the Fund and the debt rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club. The reform programs initiated then ushered a turnaround in the Egyptian economy and laid the groundwork for economic reforms that are being pursued to this day. Thereafter, Boutros-Ghali was appointed Minister of State for the Council of Ministers and Minister for International Cooperation (1993‚Äì1996), where he continued to be active in overseeing program relationship between Egypt and the Fund. He was subsequently named Minister of State for Economic Affairs (1996‚Äì1997). Thereafter he assumed the position of Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade (1997‚Äì2001), and later Minister of Foreign Trade (2001‚Äì2004). A firm advocate of trade liberalization, as Minister of Foreign Trade, Boutros-Ghali participated in the Seattle, Doha and Cancun ministerial meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and played a prominent role in launching the Doha round. He was also instrumental in concluding the Euro- Mediterranean Partnership Agreement between Egypt and the European Union in 1998. In 1999 he led the n√©gociations with the COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) a free trade agreement of some twenty east and southern African countries, into which Egypt was admitted that year. To this day this has provided the basis for an expanded Egyptian presence in the African continent. Early in the following decade and through the joint body created by the US‚ÄìEgypt Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), Boutros-Ghali was active in advancing the negotiations on the free trade agreement between Egypt and United States. He also headed the negotiations leading to the Qualified Industrial Zone (QIZ) agreement between Egypt, the United States, and Israel, established in 2004. As Minister of Finance, Boutros-Ghali headed the Ministerial Economic Committee in charge of overseeing the design and implementation of Egypt's economic reform programs. He is credited with implementing a series of reforms that helped modernize and reinvigorate the Egyptian economy and deepen its global integration. Chief among these is a major income tax and trade reforms, coupled with deregulation and liberalization in key areas of economic activity. The tax reform program was hailed as one of the most successful reforms among developing countries, which earned Egypt the position of top reformer among developing countries in 2007 by the World Bank. Boutros-Ghali received the Emerging Markets Award for Finance Minister of the Year for the Middle East Region twice (2005 and 2006). Boutros-Ghali also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2008. On 6 October 2008, Boutros-Ghali was elected chair of the IMF's policy-setting committee the IMFC. He beat India's Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram to chair the 24-member International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) the first chairman from an emerging market economy in the 65 year history of the committee ; Boutros-Ghali was well suited to assume the chairmanship of the IMFC. Having served both at the Fund and as a prominent government official, he was well aware of the concerns of the membership and of the reforms needed at the Fund. As IMFC Chairman, at the height of the international financial crisis of 2008, Boutros-Ghali helped create a consensus among national financial authorities for a coordinated approach, with active IMF participation, to address the fallout in international financial markets. Throughout Boutros-Ghali worked to promote consensus on the Fund‚Äôs most pressing reform agenda, particularly on governance reforms to enhance legitimacy and evenhandedness in surveillance, establishing a new and sustainable income model for the Fund, and adapting its instruments to better suit the evolving needs of the membership in a global economy. In 2010 Boutros-Ghali enacted a far-reaching reform of the social security and pension systems in Egypt. He introduced modern concepts of pension systems notional accounting of accumulated benefits and enacted structural changes to account for the erosion of pension benefits and the burden of pension contributions on the national economy. Boutros-Ghali resigned from his position as Minister of Finance on 29 January 2011. He declined President Mubarak's offer to join the next government headed by Ahmed Shafik. Post-revolution exile  On 31 January 2011, as part of Hosni Mubarak's responses to the 2011 Egyptian protests, The government of Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif resigned and Boutros-Ghali was replaced as Minister of Finance by Samir Radwan. Then, on 4 February 2011, the IMF reported that Boutros-Ghali had resigned the Chairmanship of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). On 11 February 2011, just prior to Mubarak's resignation, the VIP lounge at Cairo Airport opened to accommodate Boutros- Ghali and his wife before they flew to Lebanon while other ex-regime officials, including Mubarak himself, were targeted with travel bans, asset freezes, and even arrests. During the chaotic three years that followed Boutros-Ghali along with many other ministers were subjected to legal proceedings. All, including Boutros-Ghali have been rehabilitated under the Sisi administration. With Boutros-Ghali residing abroad, the final steps are taking somewhat longer in winding their way through the legal system.

The movie is the sequel to Father of the Bride (1950). Plot In this sequel to Father of the Bride, newly married Kay Dunstan (Elizabeth Taylor) announces that she and her husband are going to have a baby, leaving her father, Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracy), having to come to grips with becoming a grandfather. Middle-class family man Stanley Banks reminisces on events of the past year: One afternoon, returning from the office feeling happy and energetic, Stanley's routine is interrupted when his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) tells him that they are having dinner with their daughter Kay and her husband, Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor), to hear some important news. Although Stanley is certain that it concerns Buckley's business, the newlyweds reveal that Kay is expecting a baby. Buckley's parents, Doris (Billie Burke) and Herbert (Moroni Olsen), are delighted, as is Ellie, but Stanley broods that he is too young and vibrant to be a grandfather. Soon Ellie, flush with excitement, throws Kay a baby shower, something Stanley thinks is highway robbery not punishable by law. Later, Ellie suggests that they remodel their house to enable Kay, Buckley, and the baby to move in with them, but Stanley puts his foot down. Ellie is near tears when the wealthy Dunstans announce that they are planning to add a wing to their home for the couple, but is overjoyed when Kay and Buckley reveal that they have just bought their own little house, enabling Ellie to have free rein helping Kay decorate. After settling into their new home, Kay, who is very close to her father, expresses her concern that the baby will make a difference in her relationship with Buckley. Stanley comforts her by telling her how much he loved her as a baby. Soon the Bankses and the Dunstans are trying to outdo one another buying gifts and making plans for the baby, up to his enrollment in college. One night, while listening to Ellie, Doris, and Herbert bicker over what the baby should be named, Kay breaks down and runs to her room. Only Stanley, whom Kay feels is the sole parent who understands her, is able to comfort her. The day after pledging to Kay that he will make certain that none of the in-laws will interfere again, Stanley drags Ellie to Kay's physician, Dr. Andrew Nordell, anxious over the \\"modern\\" ideas Nordell has about a more natural method of childbirth and infant care. For the next month or so, things remain calm, until Stanley is awakened by a late night call from Buckley, who says that Kay has left him \\"for good.\\" After sneaking over to Buckley and Kay's place, Stanley learns from a cab driver that Kay took a taxi to his house. The two men then return to the Banks house, where the couple make up after Kay's jealousy is revealed to be a misunderstanding stemming from Buckley's late nights working at the office. Kay, as well as Stanley, realize Buckley's devotion to his family. As the baby's birth approaches, nerves among the parents and grandparents become frayed. The eventual birth of a baby boy delights everyone, except Stanley, a distant and wary observer of the as-yet-unnamed baby, who starts to cry whenever Stanley comes near him. When the baby is six months old, Kay joins Buckley on a brief business trip and leaves the baby with her parents, hoping to give Stanley time to grow closer to his grandson. One afternoon, while Kay is still away, Stanley takes the baby for a walk in the park. When the baby finally falls asleep in his carriage, Stanley joins some friendly neighborhood boys in a game of football and loses track of time. After the game, when Stanley cannot find the carriage, he frantically retraces his steps back to the house. Seeing through the window that Kay has returned early, he panics and takes a taxi to the local police station. There a befuddled Stanley confesses to the grim- faced police sergeant that he has lost the baby. Fearing the wrath of the police squad, who found the sweet-natured baby and have fallen in love with him, Stanley secretly prays that his grandson will not start to scream when he picks him up. To Stanley's relief, the baby is delighted to see him, and from that moment on, the two are devoted to each other. Some time later, at the baby's christening, Stanley beams with pride as his grandson is finally named \\"Stanley Banks Dunstan.\\" Cast Production from the trailer for the film Father of The Bride was such a hit at the box office and with critics, MGM rushed a sequel, Father's Little Dividend into production the following year. The film was remade in 1995 as Father of the Bride Part II, with Steve Martin and Diane Keaton again in Tracy and Bennett's roles. Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett had made films together at Fox two decades earlier, including Me and My Gal (1932), in which their characters marry, and She Wanted a Millionaire (1932). According to film critic Leonard Maltin, this film was one of the first examples of a proper modern movie studio sequel. Reception The sequel was well received by both audiences and critics and was nearly as financially successful as the first film. According to MGM records, the film earned $3,122,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1.5 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,025,000. Copyright status Originally released by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, the film entered the public domain in the United States in 1979 because MGM failed to renew the copyright registration. Despite the fact that Warner Bros. Entertainment (via ownership of Turner Entertainment) owns the distribution rights to the original, they have not yet released an authorized DVD release of the sequel, which is available on DVD through several other DVD distributors.

This school was housed in John Hamilton's old log house at Hamilton Road and Old Woodward Ave. Rev. Lemuel M. Partridge served as the teacher. In 1855, the brick \\"Old Red Schoolhouse\\" was built at Maple and Southfield roads and served as a school until 1869. The Allen House, part of the Birmingham Historical Museum, now stands where the school was. A new school was in 1869 and became the site of Birmingham's first high school. That first high school later became known as Baldwin High School, then in 1951, Birmingham High School, and in 1959, Seaholm High School. The former Baldwin High School later became Birmingham's first middle school. Through the 1930s other districts had their own elementary schools and sent paid tuition students to Baldwin High School in the Birmingham district. Throughout the 1940s, other school districts in the area were encouraged by the state to join Birmingham's school district. Southfield joined in 1943, Bloomfield Village in 1946, Franklin in 1945 and Walnut Lake in 1947.

A coefficient also has a scientific reference which is the reliance on force.  Stoichiometric coefficient of a chemical compound  To find the coefficient of a chemical compound, you must balance the elements involved in it. For example, water: H2O. It just so happens that hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) are both diatomic molecules, thus we have H2 and O2. To form water, one of the O atoms breaks off from the O2 molecule and react with the H2 compound to form H2O. But, there is one oxygen atom left. It reacts with another H2 molecule. Since it took two of each atom to balance the compound, we put the coefficient 2 in front of H2O: 2 H2O. The total reaction is thus 2 H2 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 H2O.

The squadron, known as the \\"Wild Goose\\", is a United States Marine Corps Reserve unit based at Naval Station Norfolk (Chambers Field), Virginia and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 49 (MAG-49) and the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW). With the deactivation of training squadron HMMT-164 and re-designation as VMM-164 on April 9, 2015, HMM-774 was the last dedicated CH-46E squadron in the Marine Corps. Mission Support the MAGTF Commander by providing assault support transport of combat troops, supplies, and equipment, day or night, under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint or combined operations. Maintain combat readiness and provide support to the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. Missions include assault support, CASEVAC, helicopter support team training and SEAL team support. History Marine Medium Helicopter 774 was activated September 5, 1958, at Naval Air Station New York as Marine Transport Helicopter Squadron 774 (HMR-774). The squadron operated the SH-34G/J Sea Bat helicopter. In April 1962 the squadron was redesignated Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 774, but was deactivated on 30 September 1962. HMM-774 was reactivated at Naval Air Station Norfolk (Chambers Field) on July 1, 1969. HMM-774 initially operated UH-34D Sea Horse helicopters. In 1970, the CH-46 replaced the UH-34 and in 1971 the squadron was assigned under the command of the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. In January 1991, HMM-774 was mobilized as an element of Marine Aircraft Group 26, I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) in support of OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM. In July 2004, the squadron was mobilized and deployed to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from August 2004 to March 2005 and from September 2005 to March 2006. The squadron was demobilized during July 2006. On July 12, 2010, HMM-774 embarked aboard in support of Continuing Promise 2010. During this humanitarian mission, HMM-774 provided support to numerous countries in South America, to include Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Guatemala, Suriname and Costa Rica. HMM-774 also played a vital role in the aftermath of Hurricane Thomas while deployed to South America and the Caribbean. Shortly after Hurricane Tomas passed through the Bahamas, HMM-774 pulled out of Suriname in short notice and followed the storm to Haiti. Once Hurricane Tomas made landfall, USS Iwo Jima rushed to the scene. Within hours of Hurricane Tomas' destruction, USS Iwo Jima was on the site and HMM-774 was flying aerial recon to assess the situation and decide if further assistance was required. Following a brief detachment aboard the as a participant in Amphibious Southern Partnership Station 2012, HMM-774 no longer embarked on any further navy vessels. The squadron was present for Integrated Training Exercise (ITX) 4-13, providing a portion of the aviation combat element (ACE), as well as the same exercise, 4-14, the following year at Twentynine Palms, California. Following the return from Twentynine Palms in June 2014, the squadron turned attention to preparing for the upcoming transition to the MV-22B Osprey aircraft. As of April 2015, HMM-774 continues to gradually retire aircraft leading to a complete disposition of the CH-46E by December 2015. Retirement of the final aircraft around that time will bring an end to the last dedicated Marine medium helicopter squadron operated by the Marine Corps. HMM-774 became designated as VMM-774 in January 2016 as the squadron received its first V-22 and later took its first test flight in April 2016. VMM-774 declared Final Operating Capability in April 2018 under command of Lt. Col Eric G. Burns. As of January 2020, VMM-774 no longer maintains any CH-46E aircraft.

It is a component of the Memory Manager that can speed up the Windows boot process and shorten the amount of time it takes to start up programs. It accomplishes this by caching files that are needed by an application to RAM as the application is launched, thus consolidating disk reads and reducing disk seeks. This feature is covered by US patent 6,633,968.US patent 6,633,968 Since Windows Vista, the Prefetcher has been extended by SuperFetch and ReadyBoost. SuperFetch attempts to accelerate application launch times by monitoring and adapting to application usage patterns over periods of time, and caching the majority of the files and data needed by them into memory in advance so that they can be accessed very quickly when needed. ReadyBoost (when enabled) uses external memory like a USB flash drive to extend the system cache beyond the amount of RAM installed in the computer. ReadyBoost also has a component called ReadyBoot that replaces the Prefetcher for the boot process if the system has 700 MB or more of RAM.Inside the Windows Vista kernel  Overview  When a Windows system boots, components of many files need to be read into memory and processed. Often different parts of the same file (e.g. Registry hives) are loaded at different times. As a result, a significant amount of time is spent 'jumping' from file to file and back again multiple times, even though a single access would be more efficient. The prefetcher works by watching what data is accessed during the boot process (including data read from the NTFS Master File Table), and recording a trace file of this activity. The boot prefetcher will continue to watch for such activity until 30 seconds after the user's shell has started, or until 60 seconds after all services have finished initializing, or until 120 seconds after the system has booted, whichever elapses first. Future boots can then use the information recorded in this trace file to load code and data in a more efficient fashion (i.e. by re- ordering disk reads to minimise or eliminate the need to access the same file multiple times thus minimising disk head movements). Application prefetching works in a similar fashion, but is instead localized to a single application's startup. Only the first 10 seconds of activity are monitored. The prefetcher stores its trace files in the \\"Prefetch\\" folder inside the Windows folder (typically \`C:\\\\Windows\\\\Prefetch\`). The name of the boot trace file is always \`NTOSBOOT-B00DFAAD.PF\`, and application trace files are a concatenation of the application's executable name, a hyphen, a hexadecimal representation of the hash of the path the file resides in, and a \\".pf\\" extension. Applications that host other components (i.e. Microsoft Management Console or Dllhost) have the name of the loaded component included in the computed hash as well; this results in different trace files being created for each component. Note that the Task Scheduler is the process responsible for parsing the trace data collected by the prefetcher and writing files to the prefetcher directory. As a result, the prefetcher will not operate correctly if the Task Scheduler service is not started. To further improve access times, the Task Scheduler calls Windows Disk Defragmenter every three days. When the machine is idle, the lists of files and directories that were referenced during the boot process and application startups is processed. The processed result is stored in \`Layout.ini\` in the Prefetch directory, and is subsequently passed to the Disk Defragmenter, instructing it to re-order those files into sequential positions on the physical hard drive. This will further improve performance by minimising the distance that the hard drive's heads have to be moved from one file to the next. It is possible to trigger this re-ordering (by running \\"Defrag.exe %systemdrive% -b\\" from the command line) without running a full defragmentation. If the system is installed on a solid-state drive, Superfetch is disabled but regular prefetching is left enabled.  Configuration  The Prefetcher's configuration is stored in the Windows Registry at \`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Session Manager\\\\Memory Management\\\\PrefetchParameters\`. The EnablePrefetcher value can set to be one of the following:http://home.comcast.net/~SupportCD/XPMyths.html#Optimization * 0 = Disabled * 1 = Application prefetching enabled * 2 = Boot prefetching enabled (default on Windows Server 2003 only).http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/XP_kernel.mspx * 3 = Application and Boot prefetching enabled (default). The recommended value is 3. Values higher than 3 do not increase performance, and changing the value to 2 will not make Windows boot faster.  Incorrect tweaking of the prefetcher  Often found on the Internet is the \\"/prefetch:1\\" application tweak, which is a valid but misunderstood switch. It is used to distinguish between different operating modes of an executable in case those different modes would have significantly different prefetch traces. A second myth is that the user should delete the prefetch folder contents to speed up the computer. If this is done, Windows will need to re-create all the prefetch files again, thereby slowing down Windows during boot and program starts until the prefetch files are created‚Äîunless the prefetcher is disabled. Windows maintains prefetch files in the Prefetch folder for up to the 128 most recently launched programs.

It is a theory of biological evolution that seeks to explain aspects of organisms' anatomy and behavior by reference to the way that their life histories‚Äîincluding their reproductive development and behaviors, post- reproductive behaviors, and lifespan (length of time alive)‚Äîhave been shaped by natural selection. A life history strategy is the \\"age- and stage-specific patterns\\" and timing of events that make up an organism's life, such as birth, weaning, maturation, death, etc.Ahlstr√∂m, T. (2011). Life‚Äêhistory theory, past human populations and climatic perturbations. International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 21(4), 407-419. These events, notably juvenile development, age of sexual maturity, first reproduction, number of offspring and level of parental investment, senescence and death, depend on the physical and ecological environment of the organism. The theory was developed in the 1950sStearns, S. (1992). The Evolution of Life Histories. Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press. and is used to answer questions about topics such as organism size, age of maturation, number of offspring, life span, and many others.Hochberg, Z. (2011). Evo-Devo of Child Growth : Treatise on Child Growth and Human Evolution (1). Hoboken, US: Wiley-Blackwell. In order to study these topics, life history strategies must be identified, and then models are constructed to study their effects. Finally, predictions about the importance and role of the strategies are made,Stearns, S. (1976). Life- History Tactics: A Review of the Ideas. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 51(1), 3-47. and these predictions are used to understand how evolution affects the ordering and length of life history events in an organism's life, particularly the lifespan and period of reproduction.Hill, K., & Kaplan, H. (1999). Life history traits in humans: Theory and empirical studies. Annual Review Of Anthropology, 28(1), 397.

It serves as a method to investigate further the \\"many layers of complexity of organisms and their worlds\\".Morbeck, M., Galloway, A., & Zihlman, A. The Evolving Female : A Life-history Perspective. (1997). Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press Organisms have evolved a great variety of life histories, from Pacific salmon, which produce thousands of eggs at one time and then die, to human beings, who produce a few offspring over the course of decades. The theory depends on principles of evolutionary biology and ecology and is widely used in other areas of science.  Brief history of field  Life history theory is seen as a branch of evolutionary ecology and is used in a variety of different fields. Beginning in the 1950s, mathematical analysis became an important aspect of research regarding LHT.Roff, D. (2002). Life History Evolution. Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer. There are two main focuses that have developed over time: genetic and phenotypic, but there has been a recent movement towards combining these two approaches.  Life cycle  All organisms follow a specific sequence in their development, beginning with gestation and ending with death, which is known as the life cycle. Events in between usually include birth, childhood, maturation, reproduction, and senescence, and together these comprise the life history strategy of that organism. The major events in this life cycle are usually shaped by the demographic qualities of the organism. Some are more obvious shifts than others, and may be marked by physical changes‚Äîfor example, teeth erupting in young children. Some events may have little variation between individuals in a species, such as length of gestation, but other events may show a lot of variation between individuals, such as age at first reproduction. Life cycles can be divided into two major stages: growth and reproduction. These two cannot take place at the same time, so once reproduction has begun, growth usually ends. This shift is important because it can also affect other aspects of an organism's life, such as the organization of its group or its social interactions. Each species has its own pattern and timing for these events, often known as its ontogeny, and the variety produced by this is what LHT studies.Hawkes K., ed. The Evolution of Human Life History. (2006). Santa Fe : Oxford: School of American Research ; James Currey. Gen ed. Evolution then works upon these stages to ensure that an organism adapts to its environment. For example, a human, between being born and reaching adulthood, will pass through an assortment of life stages, which include: birth, infancy, weaning, childhood and growth, adolescence, sexual maturation, and reproduction. All of these are defined in a specific biological way, which is not necessarily the same as the way that they are commonly used.  Darwinian fitness  In the context of evolution, fitness is determined by the number of descendants an organism produces over the course of its life. The main elements are survivorship and reproductive rate. This means that the organism's traits and genes are carried on into future generations, and contribute to evolutionary \\"success\\". The process of adaptation contributes to this \\"success\\" by impacting rates of survival and reproduction, which in turn establishes an organism's level of Darwinian fitness. In life history theory, evolution works on the life stages of organisms and creates adaptation‚Äîthis process establishes fitness.  Life history traits  There are seven traits that are traditionally recognized as important in life history theory. The trait that is seen as the most important for any given organism is the one where a change in that trait creates the most significant difference in that organism's level of fitness. In this sense, an organism's fitness is determined by its changing life history traits. The way in which evolutionary forces act on these life history traits serves to limit the genetic variability and heritability of the life history strategies, although there are still large varieties that exist in the world. = List of traits = # size at birth # growth pattern # age and size at maturity # number, size, and sex ratio of offspring # age- and size-specific reproductive investments # age- and size-specific mortality schedules # length of life  Life history strategies  Combinations of these life history traits and life events create the life history strategies. As an example, Winemiller and Rose, as cited by Lartillot & Delsuc, propose three types of life history strategies in the fish they study: opportunistic, periodic, and equilibrium.Lartillot, N., & Delsuc, F. (2012). \\"Joint reconstruction of divergence times and life-history evolution in placental mammals using a phylogenetic covariance model\\". Evolution, 66(6), 1773-1787. These types of strategies are defined by the body size of the fish, age at maturation, high or low survivorship, and the type of environment they are found in. So, a fish with a large body size, a late age of maturation, and low survivorship, found in a seasonal environment, would be classified as having a periodic life strategy. The type of behaviors taking place during life events can also define life history strategies. For example, an exploitative life history strategy would be one where an organism benefits by using more resources than others, or by taking these resources from other organisms.Reynolds, J., & McCrea, S. (2016). Life history theory and exploitative strategies. Evolutionary Psychology, 14(3),  Life history characteristics  Life history characteristics are traits that affect the life table of an organism, and can be imagined as various investments in growth, reproduction, and survivorship. The goal of life history theory is to understand the variation in such life history strategies. This knowledge can be used to construct models to predict what kinds of traits will be favoured in different environments. Without constraints, the highest fitness would belong to a Darwinian Demon, a hypothetical organism for whom such trade-offs do not exist. The key to life history theory is that there are limited resources available, and focusing on only a few life history characteristics is necessary. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: * Age at first reproductive event * Reproductive lifespan and ageing * Number and size of offspring Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. For example, birds with larger broods are unable to afford more prominent secondary sexual characteristics.Gustafsson, L., Qvarnstr√∂m, A., and Sheldon, B.C. 1995. Trade-offs between life-history traits and a secondary sexual character in male collared flycatchers. Nature 375, 311‚Äî313 Life history characteristics will, in some cases, change according to the population density, since genotypes with the highest fitness at high population densities will not have the highest fitness at low population densities.Mueller, L.D., Guo, P., and Ayala, F.J. 1991. Density dependent natural selection and trade-offs in life history traits. Science, 253: 433-435. Other conditions, such as the stability of the environment, will lead to selection for certain life history traits. Experiments by Michael R. Rose and Brian Charlesworth showed that unstable environments select for flies with both shorter lifespans and higher fecundity‚Äîin unreliable conditions, it is better for an organism to breed early and abundantly than waste resources promoting its own survival.Rose, M. and Charlesworth, B. A Test of Evolutionary Theories of Senescence. 1980. Nature 287, 141-142 Biological tradeoffs also appear to characterize the life histories of viruses, including bacteriophages. = Reproductive value and costs of reproduction = Reproductive value models the tradeoffs between reproduction, growth, and survivorship. An organism's reproductive value (RV) is defined as its expected contribution to the population through both current and future reproduction:Fisher, R. A. 1930. The genetical theory of natural selection. Oxford University Press, Oxford. :RV = Current Reproduction + Residual Reproductive Value (RRV) The residual reproductive value represents an organism's future reproduction through its investment in growth and survivorship. The cost of reproduction hypothesis predicts that higher investment in current reproduction hinders growth and survivorship and reduces future reproduction, while investments in growth will pay off with higher fecundity (number of offspring produced) and reproductive episodes in the future. This cost-of-reproduction tradeoff influences major life history characteristics. For example, a 2009 study by J. Creighton, N. Heflin, and M. Belk on burying beetles provided \\"unconfounded support\\" for the costs of reproduction.J. Curtis Creighton, Nicholas D. Heflin, and Mark C. Belk. 2009. Cost of Reproduction, Resource Quality, and Terminal Investment in a Burying Beetle. The American Naturalist, 174:673‚Äì684. The study found that beetles that had allocated too many resources to current reproduction also had the shortest lifespans. In their lifetimes, they also had the fewest reproductive events and offspring, reflecting how over-investment in current reproduction lowers residual reproductive value. The related terminal investment hypothesis describes a shift to current reproduction with higher age. At early ages, RRV is typically high, and organisms should invest in growth to increase reproduction at a later age. As organisms age, this investment in growth gradually increases current reproduction. However, when an organism grows old and begins losing physiological function, mortality increases while fecundity decreases. This senescence shifts the reproduction tradeoff towards current reproduction: the effects of aging and higher risk of death make current reproduction more favorable. The burying beetle study also supported the terminal investment hypothesis: the authors found beetles that bred later in life also had increased brood sizes, reflecting greater investment in those reproductive events.J. Curtis Creighton, Nicholas D. Heflin, and Mark C. Belk. 2009. Cost of Reproduction, Resource Quality, and Terminal Investment in a Burying Beetle. The American Naturalist, 174:673‚Äì684. = r/K selection theory = The selection pressures that determine the reproductive strategy, and therefore much of the life history, of an organism can be understood in terms of r/K selection theory. The central trade-off to life history theory is the number of offspring vs. the timing of reproduction. Organisms that are r-selected have a high growth rate (r) and tend to produce a high number of offspring with minimal parental care; their lifespans also tend to be shorter. r-selected organisms are suited to life in an unstable environment, because they reproduce early and abundantly and allow for a low survival rate of offspring. K-selected organisms subsist near the carrying capacity of their environment (K), produce a relatively low number of offspring over a longer span of time, and have high parental investment. They are more suited to life in a stable environment in which they can rely on a long lifespan and a low mortality rate that will allow them to reproduce multiple times with a high offspring survival rate.Stearns, S.C. 1977. The Evolution of Life History Traits: A Critique of the Theory and a Review of the Data. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 8: 145-171 Some organisms that are very r-selected are semelparous, only reproducing once before they die. Semelparous organisms may be short-lived, like annual crops. However, some semelparous organisms are relatively long-lived, such as the African flowering plant Lobelia telekii which spends up to several decades growing an inflorescence that blooms only once before the plant dies,Young, Truman P. 1984. The Comparative Demography of Semelparous Lobelia Telekii and Iteroparous Lobelia Keniensis on Mount Kenya. Journal of Ecology, 72: 637‚Äì650 or the periodical cicada which spends 17 years as a larva before emerging as an adult. Organisms with longer lifespans are usually iteroparous, reproducing more than once in a lifetime. However, iteroparous organisms can be more r-selected than K-selected, such as a sparrow, which gives birth to several chicks per year but lives only a few years, as compared to a wandering albatross, which first reproduces at ten years old and breeds every other year during its 40-year lifespan.Ricklefs, Robert E. 1977. On the Evolution of Reproductive Strategies in Birds: Reproductive Effort. The American Naturalist, 111: 453‚Äì478. r-selected organisms usually: * mature rapidly and have an early age of first reproduction * have a relatively short lifespan * have a large number of offspring at a time, and few reproductive events, or are semelparous * have a high mortality rate and a low offspring survival rate * have minimal parental care/investment K-selected organisms usually: * mature more slowly and have a later age of first reproduction * have a longer lifespan * have few offspring at a time and more reproductive events spread out over a longer span of time * have a low mortality rate and a high offspring survival rate * have high parental investment = Variation = Variation is a major part of what LHT studies, because every organism has its own life history strategy. Differences between strategies can be minimal or great. For example, one organism may have a single offspring while another may have hundreds. Some species may live for only a few hours, and some may live for decades. Some may reproduce dozens of times throughout their lifespan, and others may only reproduce one or twice. = Trade-offs = An essential component of studying life history strategies is identifying the trade-offs that take place for any given organism. Energy use in life history strategies is regulated by thermodynamics and the conservation of energy, and the \\"inherent scarcity of resources\\", so not all traits or tasks can be invested in at the same time. Thus, organisms must choose between tasks, such as growth, reproduction, and survival, prioritizing some and not others. For example, there is a trade-off between maximizing body size and maximizing lifespan, and between maximizing offspring size and maximizing offspring number. This is also sometimes seen as a choice between quantity and quality of offspring. These choices are the trade-offs that life history theory studies. One significant trade off is between somatic effort (towards growth and maintenance of the body) and reproductive effort (towards producing offspring). Since an organism can't put energy towards doing these simultaneously, many organisms have a period where energy is put just toward growth, followed by a period where energy is focused on reproduction, creating a separation of the two in the life cycle. Thus, the end of the period of growth marks the beginning of the period of reproduction. Another fundamental trade-off associated with reproduction is between mating effort and parenting effort. If an organism is focused on raising its offspring, it cannot devote that energy to pursuing a mate. An important trade-off in the dedication of resources to breeding has to do with predation risk: organisms that have to deal with an increased risk of predation often invest less in breeding. This is because it is not worth as much to invest a lot in breeding when the benefit of such investment is uncertain. These trade-offs, once identified, can then be put into models that estimate their effects on different life history strategies and answer questions about the selection pressures that exist on different life events. Over time, there has been a shift in how these models are constructed. Instead of focusing on one trait and looking at how it changed, scientists are looking at these trade-offs as part of a larger system, with complex inputs and outcomes. = Constraints = The idea of constraints is closely linked to the idea of trade-offs discussed above. Because organisms have a finite amount of energy, the process of trade-offs acts as a natural limit on the organism's adaptations and potential for fitness. This occurs in populations as well. These limits can be physical, developmental, or historical, and they are imposed by the existing traits of the organism. = Optimal life-history strategies = Populations can adapt and thereby achieve an \\"optimal\\" life history strategy that allows the highest level of fitness possible (fitness maximization). There are several methods from which to approach the study of optimality, including energetic and demographic. Achieving optimal fitness also encompasses multiple generations, because the optimal use of energy includes both the parents and the offspring. For example, \\"optimal investment in offspring is where the decrease in total number of offspring is equaled by the increase of the number who survive\\". Optimality is important for the study of life history theory because it serves as the basis for many of the models used, which work from the assumption that natural selection, as it works on a life history traits, is moving towards the most optimal group of traits and use of energy. This base assumption, that over the course of its life span an organism is aiming for optimal energy use, then allows scientists to test other predictions. However, actually gaining this optimal life history strategy cannot be guaranteed for any organism. = Allocation of resources = An organism's allocation of resources ties into several other important concepts, such as trade-offs and optimality. The best possible allocation of resources is what allows an organism to achieve an optimal life history strategy and obtain the maximum level of fitness, and making the best possible choices about how to allocate energy to various trade-offs contributes to this. Models of resource allocation have been developed and used to study problems such as parental involvement, the length of the learning period for children, and other developmental issues. The allocation of resources also plays a role in variation, because the different resource allocations by different species create the variety of life history strategies. =Capital and income breeding= The division of capital and income breeding focuses on how organisms use resources to finance breeding, and how they time it. In capital breeders, resources collected before breeding are used to pay for it, and they breed once they reach a body-condition threshold, which decreases as the season progresses. Income breeders, on the other hand, breed using resources that are generated concurrently with breeding, and time that using the rate of change in body-condition relative to multiple fixed thresholds. This distinction, though, is not necessarily a dichotomy; instead, it is a spectrum, with pure capital breeding lying on one end, and pure income breeding on the other. Capital breeding is more often seen in organisms that deal with strong seasonality. This is because when offspring value is low, yet food is abundant, building stores to breed from allows these organisms to achieve higher rates of reproduction than they otherwise would have. In less seasonal environments, income breeding is likely to be favoured because waiting to breed would not have fitness benefits. = Phenotypic plasticity = Phenotypic plasticity focuses on the concept that the same genotype can produce different phenotypes in response to different environments. It affects the levels of genetic variability because by serving as a source of variation and integration of fitness traits. Determinants of life history Many factors can determine the evolution of an organism's life history, especially the unpredictability of the environment. A very unpredictable environment‚Äîone in which resources, hazards, and competitors may fluctuate rapidly‚Äîselects for organisms that produce more offspring earlier in their lives, because it is never certain whether they will survive to reproduce again. Mortality rate may be the best indicator of a species' life history: organisms with high mortality rates‚Äîthe usual result of an unpredictable environment‚Äîtypically mature earlier than those species with low mortality rates, and give birth to more offspring at a time.Promislow, D.E.L. and P.H. Harvey. 1990. Living fast and dying young: A comparative analysis of life-history variation among mammals. Journal of Zoology, 220:417-437. A highly unpredictable environment can also lead to plasticity, in which individual organisms can shift along the spectrum of r-selected vs. K-selected life histories to suit the environment.Baird, D. G., L. R. Linton and Ronald W. Davies. 1986. Life-History Evolution and Post-Reproductive Mortality Risk. Journal of Animal Ecology 55: 295-302.  Human life history  In studying humans, life history theory is used in many ways, including in biology, psychology, economics, anthropology, and other fields.Mittal, C., Griskevicius, V., Simpson, J., & Kawakami, K. (2014). Sense of control under uncertainty depends on people's childhood environment: A life history theory approach. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 107(4), 621-637.Schmitt, D., & Rhode, P. (2013). The human polygyny index and its ecological correlates: Testing sexual selection and life history theory at the cross‚Äênational level. Social Science Quarterly, 94(4), 1159-1184. For humans, life history strategies include all the usual factors‚Äîtrade-offs, constraints, reproductive effort, etc.‚Äîbut also includes a culture factor that allows them to solve problems through cultural means in addition to through adaptation. Humans also have unique traits that make them stand out from other organisms, such as a large brain, later maturity and age of first reproduction, a long lifespan,Kaplan, H., Hill, K., Lancaster, J. and Hurtado, A. M. (2000), A theory of human life history evolution: Diet, intelligence, and longevity. Evol. Anthropol., 9: 156‚Äì185. and a high level of reproduction, often supported by fathers and older (post-menopausal) relatives.Barton, R., Capellini, I., & Stevens, C. (2011). Maternal investment life histories, and the costs of brain growth in mammals. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108(15), 6169-6174. Isler, K., & van Schaik, C. (2012). Allomaternal care, life history and brain size evolution in mammals. Journal of Human Evolution, 63(1), 52-63. There are a variety of possible explanations for these unique traits. For example, a long juvenile period may have been adapted to support a period of learning the skills needed for successful hunting and foraging. This period of learning may also explain the longer lifespan, as a longer amount of time over which to use those skills makes the period needed to acquire them worth it. Cooperative breeding and the grandmothering hypothesis have been proposed as the reasons that humans continue to live for many years after they are no longer capable of reproducing. The large brain allows for a greater learning capacity, and the ability to engage in new behaviors and create new things. The change in brain size may have been the result of a dietary shift‚Äîtowards higher quality and difficult to obtain food sources‚Äîor may have been driven by the social requirements of group living, which promoted sharing and provisioning. Recent authors, such as Kaplan, argue that both aspects are probably important. Research has also indicated that humans may pursue different reproductive strategies.Kim, Yuri, and James J. Lee. \\"The genetics of human fertility.\\" Current opinion in psychology 27 (2019): 41-45.Yao, Shuyang, Niklas L√•ngstr√∂m, Hans Temrin, and Hasse Walum. \\"Criminal offending as part of an alternative reproductive strategy: Investigating evolutionary hypotheses using Swedish total population data.\\" Evolution and Human Behavior 35, no. 6 (2014): 481-488.Vall, Gemma, Fernando Guti√©rrez, Josep M.

Tools used  * mathematical modeling * quantitative genetics * artificial selection * demography * optimality modeling * mechanistic approach * Malthusian parameter Perspectives Life history theory has provided new perspectives in understanding many aspects of human reproductive behavior, such as the relationship between poverty and fertility. A number of statistical predictions have been confirmed by social data and there is a large body of scientific literature from studies in experimental animal models, and naturalistic studies among many organisms. Criticism The claim that long periods of helplessness in young would select for more parenting effort in protecting the young at the same time as high levels of predation would select for less parenting effort is criticized for assuming that absolute chronology would determine direction of selection. This criticism argues that the total amount of predation threat faced by the young has the same effective protection need effect no matter if it comes in the form of a long childhood and far between the natural enemies or a short childhood and closely spaced natural enemies, as different life speeds are subjectively the same thing for the animals and only outwardly looks different. One cited example is that small animals that have more natural enemies would face approximately the same amount of threats and need approximately the same amount of protection (at the relative timescale of the animals) as large animals with fewer natural enemies that grow more slowly (e.g. that many small carnivores that could not eat even a very young human child could easily eat multiple very young blind meerkats). This criticism also argues that when a carnivore eats a batch stored together, there is no significant difference in the chance of one surviving depending on the number of young stored together, concluding that humans do not stand out from many small animals such as mice in selection for protecting helpless young.2014\\"The psychometric assessment of human life history strategy: A meta- analytic construct validation\\"2015\\"Race, monogamy, and other lies they told you: Busting myths about human nature\\" There is criticism of the claim that menopause and somewhat earlier age-related declines in female fertility could coevolve with a long term dependency on monogamous male providers who preferred fertile females. This criticism argues that the longer the time the child needed parental investment relative to the lifespans of the species, the higher the percentage of children born would still need parental care when the female was no longer fertile or dramatically reduced in her fertility. These critics argue that unless male preference for fertile females and ability to switch to a new female was annulled, any need for a male provider would have selected against menopause to use her fertility to keep the provider male attracted to her, and that the theory of monogamous fathers providing for their families therefore cannot explain why menopause evolved in humans.2017\\"Reproductive Ecology and Human Evolution\\"2015\\"Evolutionary contributions to the study of human fertility\\" One criticism of the notion of a trade-off between mating effort and parenting effort is that in a species in which it is common to spend much effort on something other than mating, including but not exclusive to parenting, there is less energy and time available for such for the competitors as well, meaning that species-wide reductions in the effort spent at mating does not reduce the ability of an individual to attract other mates. These critics also criticize the dichotomy between parenting effort and mating effort for missing the existence of other efforts that take time from mating, such as survival effort which would have the same species-wide effects.2016\\"Monogamy and nonmonogamy: Evolutionary considerations and treatment challenges\\"2008\\"Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition\\" There are also criticisms of size and organ trade-offs, including criticism of the claim of a trade-off between body size and longevity that cites the observation of longer lifespans in larger species, as well as criticism of the claim that big brains promoted sociality citing primate studies in which monkeys with large portions of their brains surgically removed remained socially functioning though their technical problem solving deteriorated in flexibility, computer simulations of chimpanzee social interaction showing that it requires no complex cognition, and cases of socially functioning humans with microcephalic brain sizes.2016\\"50 Great Myths of Human Evolution: Understanding Misconceptions about Our Origins\\"2013\\"The evolution of human growth\\" See also * Age determination in herbaceous plants * Age determination in woody plants * Behavioral ecology * Biological life cycle * Dynamic energy budget theory for metabolic organisation * Evolutionary developmental psychology * Evolutionary history of life * Evolutionary physiology * Human behavioral ecology * Paternal care * Plant strategies References Further reading * Charnov, E.

These bands often included both Cuban popular music and popular North American jazz, and show tunes in their repertoires. Despite this musical versatility, the movement of blending Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz was not strong in Cuba itself for decades. As Leonardo Acosta observes: \\"Afro-Cuban jazz developed simultaneously in New York and Havana, with the difference that in Cuba it was a silent and almost natural process, practically imperceptible\\" (2003: 59).Acosta (2003: 59). Cubano be, cubano bop: one hundred years of jazz in Cuba. Washington, D.C: Smithsonian Books. Cuba's significant contribution to the genre came relatively late. However, when it did come, the Cubans exhibited a level of Cuban-jazz integration that went far beyond most of what had come before. The first Cuban band of this new wave was Irakere. =Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna= > With Irakere, a new era in Cuban jazz begins in 1973, one that will extend > all the way to the present.

Irakere, which was founded by members of the Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna, has always been an eclectic band. From the beginning, the group showcased the scope of their uniquely Cuban music education: Afro-Cuban folkloric music, Cuban popular dance music, funk, jazz, and even classical music. The early years saw a lot of experimenting, with the mixing these different genres in original ways. From the vantage point of today, some of Irakere's early experiments sound awkward and don't mesh. On the other hand, some early experiments by the group were musical landmarks, that began entirely new traditions. = \\"Cubanized\\" bebop-flavored horn lines= \\"Ch√©kere-son\\" (1976) for example, introduced a style of \\"Cubanized\\" bebop- flavored lines, that departed from the more \\"angular\\" guajeo-based lines typical of Cuban popular music. > \\"Ch√©kere-son\\" is an extremely interesting one.

David Pe√±alosa sees the track as a > pivotal one ‚Äì perhaps the first really satisfying fusion of clave and bebop > horn lines‚ÄîMoore (2011: web). The horn line style introduced in \\"Ch√©kere-son\\" is heard today in Afro-Cuban jazz, and the contemporary popular dance genre known as timba. =Afro-Cuban folkloric/jazz fusion= Another important Irakere contribution is their use of bat√° and other Afro-Cuban folkloric drums. \\"Bacalao con pan\\" is the first song recorded by Irakere to use bat√°. The tune combines the folkloric drums, jazzy dance music, and distorted electric guitar with wah-wah pedal. According to UC Irvine musicologist and Irakere expert Ra√∫l A. Fern√°ndez, the Orquesta Cubana de M√∫sica Moderna members would not have been allowed by the orquesta to record the unconventional song. The musicians travelled to Santiago to record it. \\"somehow the tune made it from Santiago to radio stations in Havana where it became a hit; Irakere was formally organized a little bit later\\" (2011: web). Ironically, several of the founding members did not always appreciate Irakere's fusion of jazz and Afro-Cuban elements. They saw the Cuban folk elements as a type of nationalistic \\"fig leaf,\\" cover for their true love‚Äîjazz. They were obsessed with jazz. The fusing of Afro-Cuban elements with jazz in Irakere is a direct consequence of the poor relations between the Cuban and United States governments. Cuba's Ministry of Culture is said to have viewed jazz as the music of \\"imperialist America.\\" Trumpeter Arturo Sandoval states: \\"We wanted to play bebop, but we were told that our drummer couldn‚Äôt even use cymbals, because they sounded 'too jazzy.' We eventually used congas and cowbells instead, and in the end, it helped us to come up with something new and creative\\" (2007: web).Arturo Sandoval quoted by Bill Meredith (2007). \\"Arturo Sandoval: From Cuba, With Love.\\" Web. JazzTimes.com. Oct. Pablo Men√©ndez, founder of Mezcla, recalls: \\"Irakere were jazz musicians who played stuff like 'Bacalao con pan' with a bit of a tongue in cheek attitude‚Äî'for the masses.' I remember Paquito d'Rivera thought it was pretty funny stuff (as opposed to 'serious' stuff)\\" (2011: web). In spite of the ambivalence by some members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric/jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban popular music, Latin jazz, and salsa. As D'Rivera states: \\"We didn‚Äôt know that we were going to have such an impact in jazz and Latin music around the world. We were just working to do something good\\" (2011: web).Interview with Paquito d'Rivera by Boaz (2011). Addeo Music International. =International acclaim= In 1977 Irakere performed at two jazz festivals held in the \\"Eastern Bloc\\"‚Äîthe Belgrade Jazz Festival and the Warsaw Jazz Jamboree. The group had the opportunity to play along with jazz artists Betty Carter, Mel Lewis and Thad Jones. That same year several jazz legends including Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, and Earl Hines travelled to Cuba on a \\"jazz cruise.\\" This was the first time since the break in relations between Cuba and the United States that a group of jazz musicians from each country were able to play together. In Havana, members of Irakere had the good fortune to jam with Gillespie and Getz. Gillespie later told the press that he had fulfilled a long-standing wish to visit the island, homeland of his close friend and partner Chano Pozo.Acosta (2003: 214). In 1980 Irakere appeared at both the Newport Jazz Festival in New York City and the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. Columbia Records edited an album of five tracks recorded at the two festivals. The LP was titled Irakere, and was released by both CBS Records (JC-35655) and EGREM (Are√≠to LD-3769). The album had two sets of liner notes, one by the North American John Storm Roberts and the other by Cuban Leonardo Acosta. Irakere won a Grammy in 1979 for the best \\"Latin\\" music recording in the United States. Following this success, the band participated in the most important international jazz festivals. At the 1995 Afrocubanismo Festival at the Banff Center in Alberta, Canada, Irakere performed their piece \\"Xiomara\\" live on stage with Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas and Changuito (!Afrocubanismo Live!). =Innovations in popular dance music= In the 1980s Irakere recorded dance music, rhythmically akin to the contemporaneous style known as songo. This body of material can be seen as a type of bridge, connecting the songo era with the timba era which began in the early 1990s. One of the more popular Irakere dance tunes is \\"Rucu rucu a Santa Clara\\" (1985), written by Jos√© Luis Cort√©s \\"El Tosco,\\" who would later found NG La Banda, and launch the timba movement. Trumpeter Jos√© Crego \\"El Greco,\\" and saxophonists Carlos Averhoff and Germ√°n Velazco, are heard playing the bop- like horn lines in this dance music. The three wind players would later go on to become part of NG La Banda's \\"metales de terror\\" horn section, the basic template for timba horns. Irakere continued recording dance pieces into the 1990s. With Babal√∫ Ay√© (1997), the band fully embraced timba, the new genre which had directly resulted in part, from Irakere's innovations two decades earlier. The CD, which was nominated for a Grammy, features singer and timbales player Jos√© Miguel. In contrast to the impeccably executed dance music on the CD, Babal√∫ Ay√© also contains a long \\"bonus track\\"‚Äî\\"Babal√∫ Ay√©',\\" a loose folkloric/jazz experiment featuring the legendary lead vocalist Lazaro Ros. In 1997 Chucho Vald√©s left the group, and Chucho's son Chuchito took over the piano chair and the role of director between 1997 and 1999. =Irakere's jazz legacy= Paquito D'Rivera defected to the United States in 1980. Arturo Sandoval left the group a year later, and then defected to the United States in 1990. Both musicians have commented on the joy they felt, at being able to finally pursue jazz careers in the United States, and the honor of playing alongside their jazz heroes. As time went on, D'Rivera began looking back, and gained a deeper appreciation for the music of his first home. In 1994 he stated that he fell in love with Cuban music again on the shores of the Hudson River.Cachao. Como Su Ritmo No Hay Dos. DVD (1994). Since he left Cuba, D'Rivera has recorded several albums with Cuban themes, including La Habana- Rio Conexi√≥n (1992), 40 Years of Cuban Jam Session (1994), Habanera Absolute Ensemble (1999), and Tropicana Nights (1999). Sandoval, who was once threatened with imprisonment by the Cuban government for listening to American jazz on the radio,Arturo Sandoval quoted by Meredith (2007). JazzTimes.com. has recorded albums of both straight-ahead jazz, and jazz with a strong Cuban influence. Chucho Vald√©s has also pursued a successful jazz career, recording for the prestigious Blue Note jazz label. Discography * 1974: Teatro Amadeo Rold√°n ‚Äì Recital.

Organization  Local police unions join the IUPA to secure collective bargaining rights and afford their members job security. The IUPA negotiates on behalf of Local Unions for better wages, benefits, and working conditions in their contracts. The IUPA offers assistance on such items as equipment recommendation or budget issues and will send a representative to speak for the union. Besides help with legal representation, the IUPA offers financial, insurance and health services, educational opportunities, police products and home services. Apart from police officers, IUPA also represents some corrections officers and medical first responders. The IUPA provides NewsWatch, a weekly publication for the law enforcement community. The organization has been criticized for its status as charity: it received a 'D-' rating from the Better Business Bureau and was listed among America's worst charities by the Tampa Bay Times in 2014 because of their low spending on their mission.Tampa Bay Times, 2014. America's Worst Charities (pdf) IUPA operates under multiple trade names, including 'Police Officers Support Association' and 'National Emergency Responders Coalition'. The majority of their budget is spent on fundraising. In 2017, the IUPA raised about US$13 million through solicitors, of which almost US$12 million went to the solicitors. = Leadership = The union has three compensated 'IUPA officer' positions listed on its website: * Sam Cabral, who has been 'international president' since 1995 and officer of the organization since 1988. Cabral retired in 1991 from the Defiance, Ohio detective bureau. * Mike Crivello is the 'international vice president' and former 'union president' (2010-2018). Crivello retired in 2009 from the USAF Security Police and in 2019 from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin Police Department. * Hugh Cameron is the 'international secretary-treasurer' . Cameron was police officer in Sharon, Massachusetts. Its board further consists of a number of uncompensated vice- presidents and had a total of 16 voting board members in 2016.Form 990, 2016  History  In 1954 the predecessor of the IUPA, the National Conference of Police Associations NCPA was founded in an effort to strengthen bargaining efforts. In 1966 Canadian associations were allowed to join, and the name was changed to International Conference of Police Associations and later to International Union of Police Associations. In IUPA was founded in 1979 as a national union under AFL-CIO, reported to have 51,000 members by 1979/1980, and claimed to represent over 100,000 members in 2018. However, its 2016 form 990 are reported a much lower number: 19,200. Since 2005 it is headquartered in Sarasota, Florida, where it purchased a building in 2018 for its headquarters.  Policy positions and lobbying  The IUPA lobbied successfully in 1986 for the passage of amendments to the FLSA or Fair Labor Standards Act which helped to ensure that officers are paid fair wages, have a voice in the legal system, and have reasonable employment standards. In 2018, the IUPA was one of several organizations who supported the Providing Officers with Electronic Resources (POWER) Act to give various law enforcement access to screening devices suitable for detecting drugs such as fentanyl. In 2017, the IUPA, together with the Ohio State Troopers Association, filed a lawsuit against a Florida company for manufacturing defective bulletproof vests. Also in 2017, a IUPA spokesperson was quoted as warning about law enforcement officers being endangered by carbon monoxide fumes from defective Ford Explorer patrol cars. In 2016, the IUPA was one of several law enforcement organizations who supported federal legislation to renew the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. In 2020, IUPA spoke out about the importance of mental health concerns for law enforcement, describing stress as a bigger threat to police officers' safety and well-being than violence. In September 2019, well over a year before the elections, the union formally endorsed the re-election campaign of Donald Trump, while stating that the Democratic contenders vilified the police. In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the AFL-CIO rejected demands by the Writers Guild of America, East and others to expel IUPA.

Activities Beginning in 1998, woodcut prints from Washington began appearing on eBay and elsewhere; Washington claiming variously that the woodcuts were originals by famous artists, that they had been made by a great- grandfather whom he identified as named ‚ÄúEarl Mack Washington‚Äù and as having lived from 1862 until 1952, or that this alleged great-grandfather had rescued the associated blocks from a fire-bombed Manhattan print shop in the 1880s.Abrams, Alan E.; E.M. Washington is an African American artist and reported his great-grandfather as such, which led to increased interest in the work. It was estimated by September 2004 that as many as 60,000 prints had been sold, at prices ranging from $20 to a $350. (Washington himself has since admitted to ‚Äúcreating over 1700 wood engravings‚Äù.) Discovery In 1999, not long after Washington's work began being sold, a Canadian collector and lawyer, Kenneth Martens, found that Washington had counterfeited work by Eric Gill. Unable to get eBay or other authorities to act, Martens created a website, ‚ÄúWashington Unmasked‚Äù, which began assembling and presenting evidence that Washington's work was counterfeit. The M.C. Escher Co. found that Washington was forging the work of M. C. Escher, pressed eBay into promising that it would forbid listing of these, and filed a complaint of criminal fraud in California, as prints were being handled there by stripper Stacy Ortiz (who would later become Washington's wife). Another collector was unable to find any census record for Earl Mack Washington; others failed to find corresponding Social Security records, or evidence in the records of artists with whom Earl Mack Washington had supposedly associated. An expert in art deco identified one of the images, duplicating work by Rockwell Kent, as necessarily dated more than twenty years after the supposed death of the supposed Earl Mack Washington. A special exhibition of the work, scheduled for October 2004 at the Mid America Council Conference in Lincoln, Nebraska, was cancelled by the Amity Art Foundation after Washington both failed to produce proof that the work was other than his own and was discovered using advertisement for the exhibition to persuade others of the legitimacy of the work. A criminal complaint was filed in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, by the owners of Prairie Home Antiques, who had purchased 82 prints from Washington for $1,640 on 17 June 2004. One of Washington's former girlfriends, hairdresser Terra Zavala, provided Martens with a signed statement that she had witnessed Washington creating some of the woodcuts, and that Earl Marshawn Washington had admitted to her not knowing even the name of his great- grandfather. By 2004, Washington admitted to creating some of the images, but insisted that he had not invented Earl Mack Washington. Some of Washington's more recent listings on eBay, however, declare :African American Artist Earl M. Washington gained worldwide recognition as a wood engraver by faking his death and creating over 1700 wood engravings and offering them to the art buying public at extremely affordable prices. Virtually all of the images appear to be copies of the work of other artists, available from books or other reprints, traced onto blocks. Some images have no significant modifications; in other cases the modifications result in absurdities, such as incongruous reflections and German words turned into nonsense. Many of Washington's M.C. Escher forgeries are strikingly similar to the originals but are the wrong size. These include the works Lute, Man with Cuboid, Six Birds, Thirteen Flying Fish, Letter H, Letter A, Spherical Self Portrait, Retreat, Candle, Frog, Dice, Scales, Anvil, Watering Can, Devil Vignette, and Fish and Frogs.

On 15 March 1889, Nipsic rode at anchor in Apia Harbour with , , , and three German naval vessels, SMS Adler, SMS Olga, and SMS Eber, along with six merchantmen. Gale-force winds arose, and preparations for leaving harbor were begun, but departure was delayed in the hope that conditions next morning would be more favorable for the sortie. However, by early morning on 16 March the harbor was a mass of foam and spray as hurricane-force winds battered the ships in the 1889 Apia cyclone. Only Calliope, larger and more strongly powered than the others, was able to leave the harbor. Vandalia, Trenton, Adler and Eber, and the merchantmen were all sunk; Nipsic's captain, Cmdr. D. W. Mullin, was able by superb seamanship to beach his ship. While severely damaged by the pounding she received on the beach, Nipsic's hull was intact, although much of her topside structure was battered, all of her propeller blades damaged, two boilers spread and useless, and eight of her crew lost. Refloated and her engines repaired, Nipsic cleared Apia on 9 May for Auckland, but was turned back by heavy seas.

Among the many artists represented are John James Audubon, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Remington, Charles Marion Russell, and Georgia O'Keeffe. The Stark Museum of Art presents special changing exhibitions to explore themes in greater depth and with new approaches. The Decorative Arts collection features natural and historical themes in glass and porcelain. Highlights include the only complete set of The United States in Crystal from Steuben Glass, as well as the entire series of porcelain birds by Dorothy Doughty. The American Indian collection consists of art created by members of the tribes of the Great Plains, Southwest, Eastern Woodlands, and Northwest Coast. It includes examples of Plains clothing, body ornaments, beadwork, baskets, pottery, kachina carvings, and Navajo rugs and blankets. The Rare Books and Manuscripts collection enhances the Museum‚Äôs holdings in Western American art and in natural history subjects. Treasures include letters and manuscript journals by artists such as John James Audubon, Paul Kane, and Charles Marion Russell. The collection also holds first-edition publications on natural history, such as Audubon‚Äôs personal copy of The Birds of America. The Stark Museum of Art provides educational resources and programs for the general public and for students, teachers, and researchers.

Some are merely to provide some recreational land, and perhaps a few horses for the family's children. Others are managed as working farms for sideline income, or are even run at an ongoing loss as a lifestyle choice by people with the means to do so, functioning more like a country home than a business. By country = Australia = Rural residential living in Australian consists of very large home sites usually on the outskirts of an urban area. Often subdivisions of former farms, these blocks of land are primarily used for residential purposes by those people who enjoy the countryside or have hobbies and interests (e.g. gardening, horses, collecting and restoring old vehicles) which require more land than a normal suburban block or simply prefer the privacy of very low-density living. Farming may occur on the blocks but is usually conducted on a small scale, more as a hobby than for serious commercial gain. Occupiers of rural residential properties generally accept that there will be a lower level of amenities available to them locally (e.g. shopping centres, public transport) and are prepared to travel further to access such amenities. =United Kingdom= In the UK, country living is becoming a pastime rather than an occupation. The number of farms in England with ‚Äúno economic output‚Äù in recent surveys jumped in one year from 90,000 to 115,000, while the number of large farms fell to only 15,000. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors says that nearly half of all farms sold in a recent year were bought by non-farmers. This was said to be ‚Äúconsistent with the new trend of buying houses in the country with 20-60 acres of land -- more than a garden, not quite a fully-fledged farm.‚Äù A house with a large garden can be a mini-hobby farm, with vegetables, poultry, rabbits and a few hives of bees. An acre of land will support a couple of milking goats or some pigs, and once the hobby farmer is operating on a hectare (about 2.5 acres) he/she can think of poultry free-ranging in an orchard or a mini-flock of sheep. Doubling the area makes it possible to keep a cow and calf, and increasing it again to finds space for some cropping in support of the livestock (hay and forage crops) and a worthwhile mixed orchard with apples, plums and other fruit. Even though each type of pleasure farm may be clearly seen by its owner as a non- profit enterprise, lifestyle farmers claim great satisfaction in making the land productive enough to cover the cost of feeding the livestock and giving some high-quality additions to the household menu, from fruit and vegetables to meat and eggs. Willy Newlands, author of Hobby Farm (Souvenir Press, London, 2006), says: ‚ÄúHobby agriculture covers a wide spectrum, from backyard eggs-and-jam to large areas of grazing land. The main planks on which a definition can be made are money and labour: the hobby farmer‚Äôs income is largely made from off-farm work and the holding does not employ full-time labour. ‚ÄúThere is a blurred line between the smallholder/crofter and the hobby farmer, although my own definition would be ‚Äòa smallholder tries to make money on his land, a hobby farmer spends money on his land.‚Äô Mainly, it‚Äôs a matter of attitude. The nouveau farmer is, above all, enjoying himself.‚Äù =United States= An old dairy farm has become a hobby farm near Leicester, New York In the U.S., a high proportion of farms might be classed as hobby farms. In 2007, over 40% of farms reported less than $2500 in income and over 10% of farms had less than of land. Over 50% of primary farm operators reported that their main income was a job outside of their farm; although, this figure includes some farm operators who do not personally participate in farming and some quite large and productive farms.2007 CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE - UNITED STATES DATA, USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Table 1. Historical Highlights: 2007 and Earlier Census Years In the US, as farms grow in size, older farms become less economically viable. Some are purchased and most of the land combined with larger nearby farms, however the large farm has little use for the buildings. These can be sold off with only a building lot of real estate, but are much more saleable if a modest area, 5 to 15 acres (20,000 to 60,000 m¬≤) is sold along with them. These are usually snapped up quickly by people with well-paying city jobs who wish to live in the country, or to retirees, who wish to be active as part-time farmers. Some, especially in developed areas, are used as truck gardens, with their own produce stands, or a regular stall in a local farmer's market.

Although Arar√° people have historically staunchly retained a separate identity and religion, overtime this identity has become more blurred and harder to retain, but still exists. History =Origins= The Arar√° were originally enslaved as prisoners-of-war in the invasions of Dahomey by the Oyo Empire. Years after enslavement and transport to Cuba, Yoruba slaves descendant from the Oyo Empire began to arrive in Cuba. Due to the pre-existing tensions in West Africa these two groups remained socially distant and developed separate cultures and identities. Despite close similarities in their religious practices both groups retained separate priesthoods. It would not be until around the early 1900s that Arar√° and Yoruba Cubans would begin to comfortably culturally mix. =Evolution= Currently many Arar√° traditions have mixed with other Afro-Cuban traditions and retention of a solid Arar√° identity in heritage and things cultural has become difficult as over time various differing traditions and peoples have melded in a growing sense of Afro-Cuban cultural exchange, especially in religious practices. Religion Arar√° religion is a religion indigenous to Cuba. Its origins can be traced to the Ewe-Fon of Dahomey. Many gods known as \\"luases\\" are worshiped, similar to the Loa in Vodou, many of which are borrowed from Yoruba gods. Some minor Kongo based rituals are also practiced. Originally the religion had popularity in Matanzas and Santiago de Cuba. Even though Vodou gods are venerated rather than Yoruba gods, Santeria practices and linguistics have merged into Arar√° practices. However, the music and dance of Arar√° ceremonies continues to be quite different from that of Santeria ceremonies, thus separating the two religions. It has been estimated that around the 1890s or the early 1900s Santeria and Arar√° religions began mixing, resulting in the Arar√° adoption of Santeria customs in guidance of ceremonies. Today many practitioners use Yoruba terminology to explain their practices but still continue to use unique ceremonial dances. Some of these dances are noted for their similarity to dances in Haitian Vodou because of both religion's shared heritage but the dances still remain different.

The character was primarily featured in the Marvel 2099 series Doom 2099. The character is based on Doctor Doom, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The series was written by John Francis Moore for its first two years, and by Warren Ellis for its third. Publication history Doom first appeared in Marvel Comics Presents #118, in a preview of Doom 2099 #1. Doom 2099 would run for 44 issues (January 1993 ‚Äì August 1996), with Doom making notable appearances in 2099 Unlimited, 2099: World of Tomorrow, Ghost Rider 2099, Hulk 2099, Punisher 2099, Ravage 2099, Spider-Man 2099, and X-Men 2099. Doom also received his own special one-shot after conquering the United States, titled 2099 A.D. Fictional character biography In the year 2099, Doctor Doom abruptly materializes via an energy sphere in the ruins of Castle Doom in Latveria, after disappearing 50‚Äì100 years before. Latveria is now in the hands of a cyborg mercenary robber-baron, Tyger Wylde. Doom confronts the new dictator of the nation, but is quickly defeated by Wylde's superior technology ‚Äî his armor depleted of energy and destroyed, and his face is scarred. Left for dead, Doom finds refuge with the last remnants of his gypsy tribe, the Zefiro, via the seeress Fortune. With the aid of a brilliant Pixel employee he liberates from corporate enslavement named Dr. Celia Quinones, Doom creates, using 2099 technology, a new, far more advanced and powerful suit of silver, blue cloaked armor capable of competing with Wylde's futuristic technology, in addition to performing neurocybersurgery on him.Doom 2099 #1. Marvel Comics. Doom becomes a freedom fighter, and successfully strikes back against an increasingly more frustrated Tiger Wylde. Doom stole Wylde's shipment of tritonium, an unstable radioactive mineral, useful both as a regenerating explosive and as a power source (so powerful that a large handful could power Latveria for fifty years), thereby prompting Wylde to attack.Doom 2099 #2. Marvel Comics. Alongside his few Zefiro allies, and with the use of the tritonium he has seized, Doom is able to defeat and destroy Wylde and regain control of his homeland to once again become Monarch of Latveria, ruling once more from a rebuilt Castle Doom, built \\"as a bridge between the village of Antikva and the metropolis of Gojradia\\" (apparently an expanded and advanced Doomstadt) once again.Doom 2099 #4. Marvel Comics. Doom then decides that the world has become chaotic and corrupt, and to save it, he must conquer it. Doom is assisted by several Zefiro Gypsies: * Fortune, a Zefiro fortune teller and former advisor of Wylde. * Wire, a \\"Cybersavant\\", capable of finding information on the worldwide Cyberweb. * Xandra, Wire's girlfriend and a Wakandan soldier. Adopted into the Zefiro. * Vox, the Zefiro's magical adept. A mute boy who has one of the Eyes of Agamotto. * Poet, Fortune's former lover and capable martial artist, not a Zefiro. Doom secretly observes this era's Spider- Man.Spider-Man 2099 #4. Marvel Comics.

Several weeks later, Doom conquers the country Myridia.Doom 2099 #23. Marvel Comics. =The real Doom= Throughout the first half of the series there was speculation that Doom may not be the real Victor Von Doom. Doom was younger than the real Victor would be, his face was unscarred (when he first materialized), and his memory was fragmented; he had no recollection of how he came to 2099, and only a few memories of conflict with the Fantastic Four. Doom would later in the series recall the end of the \\"Age of Heroes\\", killing Reed Richards, growing old, and some vague memories of a war. His confusion increased when another man showed up garbed in a silver variation of his armor bearing a blazing energy port in the mid-section, similar to the arc reactor port in Iron Man's (Tony Stark) armor and a non-hooded variation of his royal green cloak, claiming to be the real Doctor Doom. This man was accompanied by Margaretta Von Geisterstadt aka the Neon Angel, a woman Doom remembered he once loved. Myridia's ruler, General Czerny, told Doom that he was in fact Erik Czerny, his son, kidnapped by the real Doom and Margaretta as a pawn in one of their lethal games. Doom faced his duplicate and in the battle, he learned that the duplicate was a false Doom, in truth an aged Erik Czerny, and, apparently, he was the true Victor von Doom. Several years ago, in the year 2089 his body had been nearly destroyed after an accident during a jaunt into the timestream and the treacherous Maragaretta had placed him within a regenerating bath (similar to the Bacta tanks featured in the Star Wars universe) which would repair his heavily damaged body and apparently retard or reverse his physical aging to some degree and rejuvenate him. Margaretta had brainwashed Erik Czerny into believing that he was Doctor Doom to amuse herself during Doom's regeneration in apparent accordance to some manipulative game that she and Victor had been engaging in to pass the time. At this time it was also revealed that Victor and Margaretta were two of the powerful \\"Shadows\\" who ruled the world in chess-like fashion and mentioned earlier in the series by the insane former Alchemax agent and Black Lotus addict Christian D'Argent during the Savage Land story arc previously played out in the pages of Doom 2099. To make their \\"game\\" even more interesting, Margaretta decided to implant some of Czerny's memories into Doom's psyche to see who would win in their inevitable battle of wills. Doom, recalling the full events of his past at last despite Margaretta's machinations defeated Czerny, reclaimed a red cloaked, black and silver set of armor he had been wearing in 2089 during the accident which set all of these events in motion and left Margaretta and a now catatonic Czerny to die in their base; the cloaked Black Fortress in the South Pacific, which was consumed by temporal ruptures unleashed by the faulty time travel technology utilized by Erik Czerny/ \\"Doom\\" during the temporal battle between himself and the true Doom. Ultimately, despite much speculation the truth behind Doom 2099's identity was finally, definitively established as being the true, albeit alternate future version of Earth 616 Victor von Doom on the final page of Doom 2099 Issue #25.Doom 2099 #25. Marvel Comics. =One Nation Under Doom= With his mind restored, Doom set out to conquer the United States, but by now he had lost several of his allies: Wire's body had died, though his mind lived on in Cyberspace; Poet died battling drug-traders; and Xandra had left to train in Wakanda. Doom conquered the US in issue #29 and left behind Fortune as regent in Latveria. As president, Doom fought against Alchemax, the Pixel Corporation, and the other corporations who controlled all aspects of everyday life in 2099. Doom recreates S.H.I.E.L.D., assigning Junkpile to take down the Red Market (illegal trade in humans for experimentation). He also made the X-Men 2099 the law enforcers of Halo City, a place where mutants and humans could live in peace. After Doom conquered the US, all 2099 titles added the letters A.D. (Anno Doom) to their titles.Doom 2099 #26-30. Marvel Comics. In response, his enemies, the corporate barons who had formerly controlled the former United States banded together and under the leadership of one John Anthony Herod, the megalomaniacal and ruthless overseer of the Chicago Reserve, a seeming repository for all manner of hideous alien tech amassed in secret by the corporate government, they successfully deposed Doom and replaced him with an apparent clone or genetic construct of the original Steve Rogers masquerading as the original Captain America. Herod then ordered the death of every inhabitant of Latveria, flooding the country with Necrotoxins which turned all organic life into a protein-rich sludge. Doom, now believed to be dead, but very much alive escapes to Halo City, where he teams up with Billy Zedd, a techno-savant featured in the X-Men storyline. Zedd rebuilds and redesigns Doom's armor, designing a distinctively masked variation of his original green hooded and cloaked silver armor and creates a vat of nanomachines, which Doom sends to Washington, using the Driver, another character from the pages of X-Men. The nanomachines are released on Herod's \\"Red House\\", which he built to replace the White House. His buildings collapse, his Captain is killed and Herod himself is cruelly left by Doom, alive but brutally disabled and in constant pain for the rest of his natural life.Doom 2099 #33-38. Marvel Comics. =Rage Against Time= Doom returned to Myridia, the world's source of information, hoping to find a way to save Latveria. He traveled back to the 20th century, battling his own present day self, as well as the 20th century Daredevil and Namor. Despite this he successfully introduces an addictive crab venom to his country, leading the populace to develop an immunity to the necrotoxin in an effort to save his people in the future. He returned to 2099, to find Fortune and about 50% of the population of Latveria alive, due to the genetic immunity, though many Latverians had been mutated into humanoid creatures dubbed \\"mutalocos\\".Doom 2099 #39-43. Marvel Comics. Immediately upon his return, Doom is greeted by the Phalanx, returned to Earth to attempt assimilation of the human race again. Against the advice of Fortune's brother, Kaz, Doom agrees to aid the Phalanx in finding sleeper agents they had left on the planet to have a better chance at assimilation, though it would seem that Doom is merely lying to further his own goals. This storyline ends the Doom 2099 book and continues in the 2099: World of Tomorrow book, which combined all running 2099 titles into one.Doom 2099 #43-44. Marvel Comics. =2099: World of Tomorrow= The Doom 2099 character was one of many to appear in the new title 2099: World of Tomorrow. Castle Doom had survived the ice caps melting, being one of the few places still above water. Doom is seemingly in league with Magus, the emissary of the Phalanx, assisting him in finding the scout which contains a code that will begin the Phalanx assimilation. In reality Doom has been experimenting on humans, with the help of Xena Kwan, former lover of Miguel O'Hara, to find a way of purging the Techno Organic Virus. Spider-Man eventually arrives and Doom blackmails him into assisting their experiments, claiming to be in possession of Miguel's brother. Magus reveals he has known all along where the scout, Nostromo of X-Nation, has been and that contact is at hand. Miguel and Xena successfully introduce and purge the virus from Doom's neurotech armor. He claims that he had always intended to allow the Phalanx to find Nostromo, as the techno organic growth has purged his country of outside influences and the ravages of the past century. Just as Spider-Man is about to destroy Nostromo, Doom activates a code he had implanted in the scout years prior, allowing Nostromo to purge the Phalanx from the Earth. Doom is destroyed along with Magnus and with his final will names Nostromo heir to the throne of Latveria.2099: World of Tomorrow #1-8. Marvel Comics. =Ragnarok Now= Doom is shown searching for a way to prevent the Timestream from collapsing after it is damaged by the efforts of the Earth-616 version of the Red Skull. As reality begins to unravel around him, Doom is rescued by Kang the Conqueror, who recruits him as part of a larger plot against the Apocalypse Twins.Uncanny Avengers #14. Marvel Comics. The Black Cabinet When Doom conquered the United States, he gathered his Black Cabinet, a group of talented and unique individuals: * Minister of Signal - Indigo Eshun, a brilliant British \\"Netglider\\" and head of an elite Cadre of Netgliders. Wire's body was rebuilt and he was Doom's instant link to the Indigo and her Netgliders, though he had become insane and would commit suicide shortly afterwards. Indigo was killed during Herod's coup. * Minister of Enemy Relations - Nkrumah, a Wakandan mercenary and head of Panther's Rage, a group of elite warriors. Xandra was one of his Panthers. * Minister of Humanity - Morphine Somers, a mutant activist with the power to age anything he touched thousands of years in mere seconds. * Minister of Order - Sharp Blue, head of the Guild of Elite mercenaries. * Minister of Punishment - Jacob Gallows, Punisher 2099, also made head of S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099. Doom also attempted to recruit the 2099-era Spider-Man to be his Minister of Superhuman Affairs.Spider-Man 2099 #32. Marvel Comics. Doom had less of an impact on the Spider-Man 2099 title, but the 2099 World of Doom special indicated that Spider-Man had indeed accepted the post.World of Doom: 2099. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities After his defeat by Tyger Wylde, Doom underwent special surgery: nanotechnology was neurocybersurgically added to his nervous system, speeding up his neural and motor responses, allowing him to interface directly with technology and heal himself from serious injuries. Due to his fragmented memory, Doom's mystical abilities were drastically decreased. For mystical matters, Doom therefore had to rely on Vox. When his memory was restored, he had full access to his mystical abilities. Doom has extensive knowledge of all sciences, and is an expert in robotics, trans-Einsteinian physics, genetic engineering, weapons technology, time travel, bio-chemistry, and other fields. Doom wears an adamantium-lanxide laced armor over cybermesh circuitry enabling tactile interface with nanoids in his brain and bloodstream, that he designed with the help of Celia Quinones. The armor allows him such abilities as flight via rocket pack, phasing (thanks to the phase shifter linked with his armor system, enabling temporary intangibility), protective forcefields, increased strength, invisibility and gauntlet energy blasts. His armor also possesses a wide array of sensors and scanners.

Sarah is a college student from San Francisco who debuted in the original Virtua Fighter. She has made several guest and cameo appearances in other games, notably in Tecmo Koei's Dead or Alive 5 as a playable character. Appearances Sarah Bryant was inspired by the Terminator character Sara Connor. Creator Yu Suzuki said that was his favorite character, \\"because it is really easy to fight with her. Sarah is a character who fights aggressively: she does not stand still waiting for the opponent's move, but moves ahead. It fully reflects my personality.\\" =Virtua Fighter games= According to the story of the original Virtua Fighter, Sarah is the youngest daughter of the Bryant family, born in 1973. She becomes suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her brother Jacky's horrible accident in the 1990 Indianapolis 500. While she investigated this accident, a mysterious group called Judgment 6 kidnapped and brainwashed her. Her innate fighting sense aroused by the brainwashing, Sarah was sent into World Martial Arts Tournament to deliver the knock-out blow to her brother Jacky. In Virtua Fighter 2, as the second tournament unfolds, Sarah is still brainwashed. However, J6 could not control her completely during the last tournament, and she failed to carry out her orders. She is further trained over the next year by the Organization to become the strongest fighting machine in the hopes that she will eliminate Jacky. In Virtua Fighter 3, although Sarah was rescued at the tournament by Jacky, who claimed to be her brother, all of her memories had been wiped clean. Although occasional fragments of her memories began to return as she lived her daily life, she found that they returned far more often during her training. With the hope that prolonged combat will advance her memory recollection, she decided to enter the third tournament. In Virtua Fighter 4, since the end of the third tournament, Sarah has fully regained her memories. Life went back to normal for all the Bryants, but Sarah still felt a twinge of uncertainty. Even though she has recovered, she remembered all the bad things she had done while under the Organization's control. Worst of all, she remembers trying to kill Jacky. She is also unable to remember clearly enough if the desire to do it was a result of J6's brainwashing, or if it was part of her own wishes all along. When she finds out that Jacky intends to join the fourth tournament, she decides to do so as well, so that she can beat Jacky and resolve matters once and for all. In Virtua Fighter 5, during the Fourth World Fighting Tournament, it was revealed that J6 had sinister motives for Sarah and she was in great danger. Vanessa offered to protect her and infiltrate the organization when suddenly, in the middle of the tournament, Vanessa disappeared. When Sarah finds out that her brother, Jacky, aims to destroy the criminal organization and has been secretly training for the Fifth World Fighting Tournament, she decides to enter in the hopes she can surpass him and bring peace to her past. Sarah doesn't realize that her efforts play neatly into J6's hands and put her in more danger than ever before. In Virtua Fighter Kids, Sarah is depicted as a young girl. Like her grown-up self, she is still brainwashed, but it is less serious; it is implied in her ending that Dural just brainwashes Sarah to get Jacky in trouble and to pick on him. =Other appearances= The anime series Virtua Fighter portrays Sarah and Jacky as children of rich parents. She has a flying squirrel named Alexander for a pet and travels with Jacky in their RV. Whenever Jacky participates in any Formula One contest, Sarah helps out by doing grid girl duties. She is later kidnapped and brainwashed by Eva Durix to be used as a basis for creating a \\"Perfect Soldier\\", Dural. In the series, she first has a crush on Akira but later has feelings for Kage-Maru. Sarah appeared as a playable character in the fighting game Fighters Megamix (optionally with her VF Kids character model) and a non-playable character in the action role-playing game Virtua Quest. She made a guest appearance as a playable character in Tecmo Keoi's Dead or Alive 5 (and its updates Dead or Alive 5 Plus, Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate and Dead or Alive 5 Last Round), joining with Akira Yuki and Pai Chan. An audio-video CD Virtua Fighter CG Portrait Series Vol.1: Sarah Bryant was released for the Sega Saturn in 1995. Sarah has made cameo appearances in several Sega games. In the shooting game Virtua Cop, a statue of her can be seen before the boss battle takes place in stage 3. In the racing game Daytona USA 2, there is a curve on the Expert course (Virtua City/New Joke City) named after her. Her signature outfit called \\"VF Suit\\" appears in the rhythm game Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA 2nd as module for Vocaloid Megurine Luka. Several figures of the character were released by various manufacturers, including Duck Tail, Moore Creations, Takara, Yujin and Sega itself. Reception The character was well received, especially for her good looks. Dreamcast Magazine ranked her as the third top \\"girl on the Dreamcast\\" in 2000.Dreamcast Magazine issue 5 page 102. Maxim included her among the nine top \\"video game vixens\\" in 2009, and GamesRadar elected her as having one of the best breasts in video games in 2012. GameSpy editors have also noted Sarah for her sex appeal and skin-tight outfits, as did others such as IGN who described her as a \\"notable\\" character and a favorite and as one of \\"Virtua Fighter legends\\". According to Justine Cassell's and Henry Jenkins's book From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games (featuring her on the cover), \\"Sarah Bryant represents Sega's new breed.\\" Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi said she and Akira \\"carry with them the history of the series\\" and for this reason specifically asked for those two to appear in DOA5. GameSpy included her in their 2009 list of \\"extremely rough brawlers\\" as Sarah \\"her devastating piston punches tenderize bodies, but it's her absolutely lethal legs that destroys the competition.\\" In a review of Dead or Alive 5 by Eurogamer, Matt Edwards opined that she \\"fits in\\" the game \\"with her sleeveless leather jacket and devastating kicks.\\" Sarah was listed in GamesRadar's article about attractive video game characters from older games whose low rate graphical in-game models belied their good looks as one of the \\"ugly polygon 'babes' of yesteryear\\" for her in-game model in the first Virtua Fighter, describing her original appearance as a \\"complete with a dead-eyed stare and no upper lip.\\" Sharing the sentiment, UGO stated that \\"thanks to the magic of 3D imaging, we've come to see Sarah not as the stack of polygons we first encountered back in 1993, but as the voluptuous dime piece seen here today, as she more than fills out that jumpsuit,\\" ranking her tenth in their 2011 list of fighting games' \\"finest female fighters\\". She was ranked as the 76th best-looking game woman by Brazilian GameHall's Portal PlayGame in 2014.

Timba.com. > http://www.timba.com/artists/ng-la-banda?lang=en-US The birth of timba The first timba album was NG's En la calle (1989). This was followed by No se puede tapar el sol (1990), and En la calle otra vez (1991). None of these phonorecords were released on CD in their entirety, but Ned Sublette's QBADisc label released a nine-track compilation in 1992.En la calle Qbadisc CD 9002 (1992). NG La Banda's horn section is affectionately known as ‚Äúlos metales del terror‚Äù or metals of terror. So important is the work of the horn section inside the timba format that this naming of the horn section itself has become common.Vaughan, Umi (2012: Kindle 621). Rebel Dance, Renegade Stance: Timba Music and Black Identity in Cuba. The University of Michigan Press. Kindle Edition. =\\"La expresiva\\"= The track \\"La expresiva,\\" featuring the lead vocals of Issac Delgado, is emblematic of the early timba innovations by NG La Banda. Departing from the rumba-inspired percussion parts of the previous songo era, \\"La expresiva\\" uses typical salsa bell patterns creatively incorporated into a Cuban-style timbales/drum kit hybrid. The tumbadora ('conga') plays elaborate variations on the son montuno- based tumbao, rather than in the songo style. The bass tumbaos of Feliciano Arango are busier than typically heard in salsa and Cuba dance music. Break- down Segundo (mid drum) accent in early rumba break-down, \\"La polemica.\\" Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas (1988). Accent in early timba break-down, \\"La expresiva.\\" NG La Banda (1989). \\"La expresiva\\" introduced the phenomenon of timba break-downs, where the bass momentarily stops playing tumbao, and changes to glissandos ('slides') and accented percussive \\"punches,\\" that resemble drum strokes more than bass notes. These break-downs share similarities with the rumba break-downs (where the lowest pitched drum drops out) of that era. For example, the \\"punches\\" heard in \\"La expresiva's\\" break- down (3:31) are essentially the same pattern heard on the rumba \\"La polemica\\" by Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas, during that song's break-down (3:38).\\"La polemica\\" (Israel Berriel). Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas. Rumba Caliente 88/77. \\"La expresiva\\" brought the clave-based, be-bop flavored horn lines pioneered by Irakere into mainstream Cuban popular dance music. This marked a significant departure from the more \\"angular\\" guajeo-based horn lines typical of the son montuno, mambo, and salsa. Timba researcher Kevin Moore offers a clave analysis of \\"La expresiva\\": > After the first mambo at 1:15, the clave changes from 2-3 [clave] to 3-2 > [clave]. The last two beats of the mambo are omitted and the next section > begins on the other side of the clave with only piano and g√ºiro. At first it > sounds like the piano is finishing the 2-3 phrase but it‚Äôs actually starting > a new one in 3-2 as confirmed by the later entrance of the coro.

A macho sound for black sex. In Deborah Thomas and Kamari Clarke, eds. Globalization and Race. Transformations in the cultural production of blackness. Duke University Press. Cortes became known as \\"El Tosco\\" or \\"Rude Boy\\" because of his sexual lyrics and unabashed stage and street presence. As a result of NG La Banda's success, many more timba bands sprung up throughout the 1990s. \\"The intellectuals say that timba is crap,\\" Cort√©s says.\\"But this is a racist concept. Cuban popular music has always been the music of the people, of the poor barrios, where there are very few whites. This is the music that comes from below, that makes people want to dance. But just because people dance to it doesn't mean it's not as serious as any other serious music. Timba is not your father's, or your grandfather's, Cuban music; not the sweet traditional sounds of the international hit Buena Vista Social Club. Timba is the sound of Cuba now, a rhythmically dense, relentlessly energetic music played by highly skilled musicians for a demanding dance-floor audience, with lyrics that draw from and become part of the language of the streets.\\" > As a music style, timba crystallized in the late 1980s largely thanks to the > experimentations of NG La Banda, a band led by black flute player and > composer Jos√© Lu√≠s Cort√©s, who made his music into the voice of the marginal > black barrios of the capital city . . . in the early 1990s the novel style > moved to the centre of the popular musical scene of Havana.

Background Little is known of his life, but he was probably French. His sole attributable work is Architrenius (The Prince of Lamentations), a Latin poem in eight cantos. The poem was written in imitation of classical Latin poets, sometimes borrowing whole verses from chosen authors. He dedicated his work to Walter de Coutances, just after Walter had become Archbishop of Rouen (1184). Of John of Hauville's later life nothing is known, except that his pupil, Gervase of Melkley, wrote of him in the past tense in his Ars poetica, written around 1210: John of Hauville was therefore probably dead by then. Architrenius was a great success and was frequently copied and commented on before its first printing in 1517, at Paris, by Jodocus Badius Ascencius.

History  In the Middle Ages, the region came under the control of the Magyars who absorbed the Slavic and the remnant Avar population. There was archaeological evidence found in various small villages in the Middle Ages. The area was under the ownership of J√°nos Hunyadi in the 15th century. With the arrival of the Turks, the population disappeared and was at first replaced by Bunjevci who came from Bosnia and the Croatian Littoral. The first mention the village comes from 1543 in the records of the Archbishopric of Kalocsa. In the 17th century, there was a steady influx of Bunjevci under the leadership of the Franciscans from Bosnia. The last major group came under the leadership of captains Markoviƒá and Vidakoviƒá. With the Turkish defeat at the Battle of Zenta, B√°csalm√°s came under the control of the Habsburgs where it became a part of the Military Frontier. In 1772, the village received an Urbarium form in the Bunjevac language, which reflected the majority of the population. The Urbarium was for the landowners of the village consisting of 72 Bunjevci , 11 Hungarians, 3 Slovaks and 2 Romani. In the 1780s, 195 German families were settled by the Habsburgs in B√°csalm√°s who continued to be the overwhelming majority until 1945. Most of these settlers came from Swabia, Alsace and Mainz. In the following decade, land grants were given to newly ennobled men from the immediate region to the Hungarian family of N√©metszeghy, Koronay, and Bunjevac families of Antunoviƒá, Rudiƒá, Kovaƒçiƒá, and ≈†i≈°koviƒá. In the 19th century the town became a centre for wine and grain production which was exported mainly to Austria and Bohemia. It also became an important railroad junction. In effect it became a prosperous community. However, it retained its rural character the whole time with a strong artisan class which served the surrounding region. In 1941, the town had a population of 13,000, two-thirds of whom were Germans (Danube Swabians). In 1945‚Äì46, the majority of Germans were expelled and Hungarians were brought from Slovakia to replace them. In 1986, B√°csalm√°s became a town with a population of over 8,000. With the closure of some industries and the reforms in agriculture, the town is losing its population. B√°csalm√°s is struggling to replace the declining agricultural sector, but alternatives are hard to find. The farming cooperative privatized in the early 1990s and the local state farm accumulated large debts.

Marmora was built at Monongahela, Pennsylvania, in 1862, was purchased by the Navy at St. Louis, Missouri, on 17 September 1862 from Messrs. Brenan, Nelson, and McDonnell; and commissioned at Carondelet, Missouri, on 21 October 1862, Captain Robert Getty in command. Vicksburg campaign Early the next morning she stood downriver to join the Mississippi Squadron in operations against the Confederate river stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Marmora's first action occurred when she attacked and destroyed several barges at Lake Providence, captured two skiffs and demolished a flatboat further down stream. On 29 November Marmora discovered heavy enemy fortifications 20 miles from the mouth of the Yazoo River; taking special care to avoid any encounter with them until in company with the fleet. On 5 December, Marmora helped to refloat the ram , aground on Paw Paw Island. On 11 December she ran 20 miles up the Yazoo River and discovered several suspicious looking objects floating on the river. When she fired into one of them, a tremendous explosion occurred which shook the ship from stem to stern, though at a distance of 50 feet or more. She carefully avoided the others and left final destruction of the remaining mines to riflemen ashore. The next day, Marmora led , , and up the Yazoo until the Union ships sighted several torpedoes. Cairo commenced shelling the right bank and sent out a boat to investigate the nearest torpedo. As the boat towed the torpedo alongside, another exploded under Cairo, ripping the bottom entirely out. As she rapidly sank, Marmora and the other Union ships sent boats to the rescue and saved everyone. Marmora and her sister ships continued to remove torpedoes and to cooperate with the Army during probing actions seeking to find a weakness in Vicksburg's defenses. On 27 December the squadron heatedly engaged Confederate batteries at Drumgould's Bluff. That day, Admiral David Dixon Porter reported the Yazoo clear of torpedoes within one-half mile of the southern guns. The next day, his gunboats' mobile fire kept Confederate troops off balance while General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops landed to attempt to capture strong southern works at Chickasaw Bluff, a vantage point upstream from Vicksburg. Two days later, despite excellent support from naval guns. Sherman's troops, hindered by heavy rains and opposed by strongly reinforced Confederate units, withdrew. Battle of Fort Hindman Marmora participated in the attack on Fort Hindman, Arkansas, 4 to 11 January 1863, when it was taken; the post was 80 miles above the mouth of the Arkansas River and was consequently important in Union efforts to control the flow of supplies from the west across the Mississippi River at Vicksburg and to southern armies in the east. Yazoo River operations  In February 1863, Marmora joined four other ships in preparations for the Yazoo River Expedition, departing Helena on 27 March. The joint Army-Navy Expedition captured and destroyed newly constructed Confederate batteries 20 miles up the Yazoo. For the next few months, Marmora concentrated on patrol duty and supply runs. Guerrilla activities caused Marmora to stop at Gaines' Landing on 13 through 15 June to burn houses. Steaming up the White and Little Red Rivers on 8 August, the ships sought information on the location of General Sterling Price's army, the ships found St. Charles, Arkansas, deserted as Union forces had taken it on 16 June and had control of White River. Cavalry from the ships did encounter Confederate resistance on landing at Devall's Bluff on 17 August. In November Marmora worked at the mouth of the Yazoo to prevent Confederate blockade of the river. Although Union forces had taken Yazoo City, their position was not secure. Confederates attacked the city en masse on 8 March 1864, causing Marmora and other rams to steam to the rescue. Marmora remained off this point with the other ships for several months, as Union forces mounted the campaign in Red River. Three of her sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for going ashore with a howitzer and assisting in the fight at Yazoo City on 5 March. These men were Seaman William J. Franks, Seaman Bartlett Laffey, and Seaman James Stoddard. Marmora next returned to Mound City and was placed in reserve while still in commission. After fighting stopped, she decommissioned on 7 July 1865 and was sold at Mound City, Illinois to D. D. Barr on 17 August 1865.

In the film, he is the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the mock rock band Spinal Tap. David is played by actor Michael McKean, who improvised the role through the whole film. McKean writes in his introduction to This Is Spinal Tap: The Official Guide, \\"When I am called upon to generate copy about the mostly fictional entity called Spinal Tap, I usually do so in the mostly fictional character of David St. Hubbins.\\" St. Hubbins's name was inspired by Derek St. Holmes, who is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for Ted Nugent. Character biography St. Hubbins, whose namesake is the \\"Patron Saint of Quality Footwear\\", was born August 13, 1947, in Squatney, London, England. He grew up in Squatney in flat #45. Fellow Spinal Tap band member Nigel Tufnel lived next door in flat #47. They did not know each other at first. At age 7 and 8, the new friends Nigel and David began their musical adventure together. David says: \\"We left school and started playing Tube station skiffle. It was like the filings feel about a magnet. We were the filings, Spinal Tap became the magnet\\". They have recorded the first song they wrote together in 1955: \\"(Cry) All the Way Home\\". After his first divorce, St. Hubbins was married to his long-time girlfriend, Jeanine Pettibone (June Chadwick). They moved to Pomona, California, where they opened two \\"boutiquerias\\". They were divorced in early 2000 and remained on friendly terms. David credits Jeanine, and her love of astrology, with getting his cosmically challenged life back in order. In an interview with David and Jeanine, David said, \\"Before I met Jeanine my life was cosmically a shambles. I was using bits and pieces of whatever eastern philosophy would drift through my transom\\". His relationship with Jeanine caused some turbulence in the band, especially when she became the band's manager toward the end of the tour documented in This Is Spinal Tap. According to the movie, David has a son named Misha. The fictional character of David St. Hubbins took part in the non-fictional musical advocacy group Hear 'n Aid.

The episode broke with the standalone story format of earlier seasons, making a major change in the series status quo by having regular cast member George Costanza become engaged to Susan Ross. Susan was a recurring character during season 4 of the series but had not been seen since. The episode aired on September 21, 1995. Plot George breaks up with a woman after she beats him in a game of chess. When he tells Jerry about it at Monk's, they both realize that they have done nothing with their lives and decide to make some changes. However, Kramer warns Jerry against marriage, so he decides to remain with his singles lifestyle. George, meanwhile, proposes to his old girlfriend Susan Ross. George is irritated when Jerry tells him that he broke up with his girlfriend Melanie because she eats peas one at a time, arguing that they had a pact to change their lives. He begins to regret his engagement as he has to pass up opportunities to see action films and baseball games with Jerry in order to watch sentimental films and Mad About You with Susan. A barking dog is keeping Elaine from getting sleep. Kramer refers her to Newman, who agrees to kidnap the dog and relocate it. Later that night, Elaine, Kramer and Newman rent a van and steal the dog, a Yorkshire Terrier. Kramer leaves the dog at a random doorstep in Monticello, but it rips off a piece of his shirt with a tag from Rudy's vintage shop. The dog finds its way back to its owner's apartment, carrying the piece of Kramer's shirt. With the shirt scrap as evidence, police officers arrest Kramer, Newman and Elaine for dognapping. Elaine decides she needs to make some changes with her life. Production Writer/co-creator Larry David came up with the idea of George becoming engaged with the intent that it be a season-long story arc, but at the time had no plan for how the arc would be resolved. He wrote the first three episodes of the series in order to set the tone for the season. The expression \\"Happy, Pappy?\\" was used by actress Heidi Swedberg in off-camera conversations with David. All the clips in the flashback montage of George and Susan's relationship were filmed specifically for this episode. Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus lost her voice overnight from doing the scene where Elaine shouts at the dog, so the writers worked her hoarseness into the episode's script.  Critical reception  David Sims of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"The two-part (sorta) season opener to Seinfeld really feels like Larry David throwing down a marker. You know how last year was just generally a lot of fun, and had a little more broad, goofy comedy? ... For his last season on the show (he would return for the finale and continue to voice Steinbrenner) David goes back to the model he employed in seasons prior of having a loose arc for the year, and this time it's George getting married. The news is abrupt, shocking, and hilariously welcome. ... George is such a wreck by the end of that spectacle, it's hard not to pity him, stupid and impulsive as he may be.\\" Joanna L. Di Mattia, author of the essay \\"The Show About Something: Anxious Manhood and the Homosocial Order on Seinfeld,\\" argues that \\"Susan Ross ... ultimately embodies the restrictions of marriage for George, and therefore a real threat to the male friendships on the show.\\" This episode \\"illustrates how to approach marriage with the most inappropriate partner, solely for the purpose of personal reinforcement.\\" Vanity Fair put \\"The Engagement\\" at #106 in a ranking of all 180 episodes.

Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of the Jewish religion. In its modern form, the Jewish feminist movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to Judith Plaskow, the main grievances of early Jewish feminists were women's exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, women's exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot (mitzvot meaning the 613 commandments given in the Torah at Mount Sinai and the seven rabbinic commandments instituted later, for a total of 620), and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce in Jewish religious courts.Plaskow, Judith. \\"Jewish Feminist Thought\\" in Frank, Daniel H. & Leaman, Oliver. History of Jewish Philosophy, Routledge, first published 1997; this edition 2003. According to historian Paula Hyman, two articles published in the 1970s were trailblazers in analyzing the status of Jewish women using feminism: \\"The Unfreedom of Jewish Women\\", published in 1970 in the Jewish Spectator by its editor, Trude Weiss- Rosmarin, and an article by Rachel Adler, then an Orthodox Jew and currently a professor at the Reform seminary Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, called \\" The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman\\", published in 1971 in Davka. Also, in 1973, the first [American] National Jewish Women's Conference was held, in New York City; Blu Greenberg gave its opening address.  Jewish feminist theology  Various versions of feminist theology exist within the Jewish community. Some of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterization of God, and/or more feminist language in general, within the siddur (Jewish prayerbook) and service. In 1946, the new Silverman siddur of Conservative Judaism changed the traditional words of thanking God for \\"not making me a woman\\", instead using words thanking God for \\"making me a free person.\\" In 1976, Rita Gross published the article \\"Female God Language in a Jewish Context\\" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist Judith Plaskow considers \\"probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context\\". Gross was Jewish herself at this time. Reconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert (Reform Judaism, Winter 1991) comments: In 1990 Rabbi Margaret Wenig wrote the sermon, \\"God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older,\\" which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California. Rabbi Paula Reimers (\\"Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother\\", Conservative Judaism 46 (1993)) comments: Ahuva Zaches affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God's gender?, in the Union for Reform Judaism's iTorah, ): These views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements.\\"This genderless God also represents a profound betrayal of the Torah narrative.\\" Matthew Berke, \\"God and Gender in Judaism\\", in Copyright (c) 1996 First Things 64 (June/July 1996): 33‚Äì38 Orthodox Jews and many Conservative Jews hold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern feminist ideology into Jewish tradition.{} Liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement's Siddur Lev Chadash (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement's Forms of Prayer (2008).Siddur Lev Chadash In Mishkan T'filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as \\"He\\" have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah). In 2015 the Reform Jewish High Holy Days prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah. It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer Avinu Malkeinu that refers to God as both \\"Loving Father\\" and \\"Compassionate Mother.\\" Other notable changes are replacing a line from the Reform movement's earlier prayerbook, \\"Gates of Repentance,\\" that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line \\"rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]\\", and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering \\"mibeit\\", Hebrew for \\"from the house of\\", in addition to the traditional \\"son of\\" or \\"daughter of\\". In 2003 The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust, the first full-length feminist theology of the Holocaust, written by Melissa Raphael, was published. Judith Plaskow's Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective (1991), and Rachel Adler's Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics (1999) are the only two full-length Jewish feminist works to focus entirely on theology in general (rather than specific aspects such as Holocaust theology). Thus, Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective (1991) is the first book of Jewish feminist theology ever written. There is a growing subfield in the study of gender and Judaism, which sees the binaries of male and female as crucial constructs in Jewish thought.Kosman, Miriam, Circle, Arrow, Spiral, Exploring Gender in Judaism, Menucha Publishers, 2014. ^Steven F. Friedell, \\"The 'Different Voice' in Jewish Law: Some Parallels to a Feminist Jurisprudence,\\" Indiana Law Journal, October 1992Neusner, Jacob, 'Androgynous Judaism: Masculine and Feminine in the Dual Torah,' Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1993. ^ While the male/female dialectic first makes its appearance in the story of creation, the Talmud insists that the idea of male and female extends way beyond sex roles: \\"Everything that God created, He created as male and female....\\"(Baba Batra 74b) This dialectic takes on even greater theological significance in light of the Biblical book, Song of Songs, which has been traditionally interpreted as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the Nation of Israel, where the Nation of Israel is cast as feminine towards God, who is represented in the story by the male lover. Other examples of topics in which the male/female dynamic is used metaphorically include: the relationship between Shabbat and the days of the week[8], the relationship between the Oral and Written Law, the relationship between This World and the Next, the interplay between the legal and extra- legal aspects of Talmud (Halacha and Aggada)[9], and the Jewish calendar, which makes use of both the sun (traditionally symbolic of the male force) and the moon (traditionally symbolic of the female force).Heshelis, Devorah, The Moon's Lost Light, Targum Press, 2004 Gender polarity is robustly maintained in both the Bible and in the Oral Law, (Deuteronomy, 22:5, even forbids cross- dressing) and upholding this polarity is seen as critical in achieving synthesis between the masculine and feminine. This exploration of gender- constructs in primary sources reveals surprising valuation of the feminine prototype in Kabbala-based sources which invites inquiry into the social, ethical, ecological, moral and philosophical ramifications of a feminine perspective within Jewish thought. Rinder Sarah, \\"A New, Sophisticated, Haredi View on Gender\\" The Forward, 24 November 2015  Orthodox Judaism =Haredi positions on feminism= The leaders of Haredi Judaism regularly pronounce all forms of feminism as \\"Reform,\\" as non-Jewish, or as a threat to Jewish tradition. An article in Cross-currents criticizing advancing women's leadership writes that: \\"The entirety of traditional Jewish religious life, including its age-old ritual norms and societal norms, even if they lack formal codification, reflects Torah values, be they halachic or hashkafic; every aspect of our multi-millenia traditional religious communal modality is embedded in or predicated upon halachic or hashkafic axioms. These axioms may not be apparent to the uninitiated, yet failure to perceive them does not grant license to negate, dismiss or reform.\\" The haredi claim is that feminism is changing Torah. Haredi Judaism also espouses strict essentialist differences between men and women, rooted in ideas about God's will and creation. The haredi worldview espouses the idea of womanhood as expressed in King Solomon's poem \\"A Woman of Valor,\\" which praises a woman for maintaining the home, care for the family, and food preparation, practices which the poem admires in women as part of their wisdom, courage, creativity, dedication, selflessness, and perhaps business acumen. The most important thrust of haredi education for girls and young women is to educate, train and encourage them to become wives and mothers within large families devoted to the strictest Torah Judaism way of life. While most haredi women receive schooling in Beis Yaakov schools designed for them exclusively, the curriculum of these schools does not teach Talmud and neither encourages nor teaches its female students to study the same subjects as young haredi men in the haredi yeshivas. In some haredi communities, the education of girls in secular subjects (such as mathematics) is superior to that of boys. This is partly because of the greater time devoted to sacred subjects in the case of boys, and partly because many haredi women work in paid jobs to enable their husbands to engage in full-time Torah study or to bring in a second income. There is currently no movement within haredi Judaism to train women as rabbis, and there is no visible movement to advance women's Talmudic knowledge. In the fall of 2015, the Agudath Israel of America, which is part of haredi Judaism, denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. Nevertheless, most haredi women are exposed to modern ideas and secular education, unlike most haredi men. Prof. Tamar El- or explored changes in women's lives and the impact of mixed educational cultures on women's empowerment in her seminal book, Educated and Ignorant about the education of women in the Gur Hassidic community. However, in 2016 it was learned that the Satmar sect issued a decree warning that university education for women was \\"dangerous\\". Written in Yiddish, the decree warned: \\"It has lately become the new trend that girls and married women are pursuing degrees in special education. Some attend classes and others online. And so we'd like to let their parents know that it is against the Torah. We will be very strict about this. No girls attending our school are allowed to study and get a degree. It is dangerous. Girls who will not abide will be forced to leave our school. Also, we will not give any jobs or teaching position in the school to girls who've been to college or have a degree. We have to keep our school safe and we can't allow any secular influences in our holy environment. It is against the base upon which our Mosed was built.\\" There are some signs of a feminist movement beginning to sprout in the haredi world, especially in Israel. During the 2013 Israeli elections, Esti Shushan led a feminist drive to force haredi political parties to allow women to run on their lists (the parties currently forbid women from running). The campaign, called on haredi women to refuse to vote for parties that exclude women. In addition, during the 2013 municipal elections in Israel, three haredi women took an unprecedented step and ran for their local municipalities‚ÄîShira Gergi in Safed, Ruth Colian in Petach Tikva, and Racheli Ibenboim in Jerusalem. Gergi is the only one who was elected, becoming the first haredi woman to sit on a municipal council, and becoming the first woman on the Safed council in twenty years. One of the most interesting voices of haredi feminism is that of Adina Bar-Shalom, daughter of the late Israeli Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Bar Shalom established the Haredi College of Jerusalem, regularly speaks out about the importance of women's education and work, and in 2013 established a women's-only political party in the haredi town of Elad. In addition, in early 2014 she considered a bid to become the president of Israel. In March 2014, Bar-Shalom wrote that the haredi feminist revolution is already here. \\"The train has left the station,\\" she wrote. Another emerging haredi voice is that of Esty Reider-Indorsky. She \\"came out\\" in March 2014 as a popular haredi columnist who had been writing under a man's name‚Äî\\"Ari Solomon\\"‚Äîand has a large following under her pseudonym. In an article in YNet, Reider-Indorsky claimed that there is a strong feminist movement brewing in the haredi community, and asked non-haredi women to stay out of their own internal revolution. \\"Don't patronize us,\\" she writes to non-haredi feminists. \\"Don't make revolutions for us, or try to clean out our backyard. We are doing it in our own way and we are doing it better: There is an abundance of haredi women lawyers and women in start-up.... There are haredi women who choose an academic career, and there are haredi women leading change in every area imaginable... The change will happen. it's already happening.\\" These are signs of the beginnings of feminist movement in the haredi community in Israel. =Non-haredi Orthodox Jewish feminism= Orthodox Jewish feminism, unlike its Reform/Reconstructionist counterparts, seeks to change the position of women from within Jewish law (halakha). Orthodox feminism works within the halakhic system and works with rabbis and rabbinical institutions to create more inclusive practices within Orthodox communal life and leadership. Orthodox feminism tends to focus on issues, such as the problems of agunah, fostering women's education, leadership, and ritual participation, women's leadership and making synagogue more women-friendly. Unlike other denominations, Orthodox feminists retain the partition in synagogue and do not count women in a minyan. The all-women's prayer group‚ÄîWomen's Tefilla Group, is an Orthodox practice that began in the 1970s and continues today. New educational programs have enabled Modern Orthodox women to study Talmud and other rabbinic literature, at levels intended to be comparable to a yeshivah or kollel for men, including Drisha Institute (founded in 1979), Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies, and Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies. In 1997, Blu Greenberg founded the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA) to advocate for women's increased participation and leadership in Modern Orthodox Jewish life and to create a community for women and men dedicated to such change.Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance. Jofa.org (14 April 2011). Retrieved on 18 October 2011. JOFA has focused on issues including: agunah, bat mitzvah, women's scholarship, women's prayer, ritual, women's synagogue leadership, and women's religious leadership. Also in 1997, Gail Billig became the first female president of a major Orthodox synagogue, at Congregation Ahavath Torah in Englewood, N.J.Klein, Abigail. (13 July 2007) Leaders Lift Spirit in Orthodox Women's Section. Women's eNews. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. In 2002, the first partnership minyans were established‚ÄîShira Hadasha in Jerusalem, and Darkhei Noam in New York City. These are Orthodox communities that maximize women's participation in the prayer to the full extent possible within halakha. Although critics of partnership minyan argue that these are not \\"Orthodox\\", the communities themselves vehemently insist that they are Orthodox. The fact that the synagogues have partitions and do not count women as part of the minyan (and thus do not allow women to lead any parts of services that require a quorum) demonstrate the loyalty to Orthodox practice. Dr. Elana Sztokman, former Executive Director of JOFA, wrote extensively about this phenomenon in her book The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish Men in an Egalitarian World, and examined this dynamic in which the partnership minyan considers itself Orthodox but is often rejected as Orthodox by other members of the community. Today there are over 35 partnership minyans around the world. Another major historical event of Orthodox feminism occurred in 2009, when Rabba Sara Hurwitz became the first publicly ordained Orthodox woman rabbi. Avi Weiss then launched a training school for Orthodox women in rabbinic positions, Yeshivat Maharat (acronym for \\"Morah hilkhatit rabbanit toranit\\"‚Äîa rabbinic, halakhic Torah teacher.) Rabbi Weiss had originally announced that graduates would be called \\"rabba\\", but when the Rabbinical Council of America threatened to oust him, he recanted and created the term maharat. The first cohort of maharats graduated in June 2013: Maharats Ruth Balinsky-Friedman, Rachel Kohl Finegold and Abby Brown Scheier. In 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat. Also that year Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by the Yeshivat Maharat, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi. In January 2013 Tamar Frankiel became the president of the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, making her the first Orthodox woman to lead an American rabbinical school.Dr. Tamar Frankiel  Academy for Jewish Religion, California The school itself is transdenominational, not Orthodox. In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the Kaddish prayer in memory of their deceased parents. Also in 2013, the first class of female halachic advisers trained to practice in the US graduated; they graduated from the North American branch of Nishmat's yoetzet halacha program in a ceremony at Congregation Sheartith Israel, Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan. However, this event was met with only faint enthusiasm among Orthodox feminists for several reasons. One is that Nishmat consistently distances itself from feminism, as its founder Chana Henkin often pronounces that she is not a feminist and that the women who graduate from Nishmat do not adjudicate halakha but always ask male rabbis. Another reason is that against the backdrop of the graduation of women from Yeshivat Maharat, in which women are full leaders with complete authority to adjudicate and function as communal rabbis this event does not necessarily represent the greatest advancement for Orthodox women and is arguably a step backward. That is, women counseling women only on \\"women's issues\\" without any real halakhic authority of their own keeps women in a somewhat more official version of traditional gender roles. In 2014, the first women were elected as national officers of the Orthodox Union; specifically, three female national vice presidents and two female associate vice presidents were elected. In June 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as \\"Rabbi\\".Canadian Jewish News Why Orthodoxy Needs Female Rabbis, 25 November 2015 In 2015, Rabbi Kagedan completed a residency at Shira Hadasha in Australia. However, in the fall of 2015, the Rabbinical Council of America, representing over a thousand Orthodox rabbis across the United States, formally adopted a policy prohibiting the ordination or hiring of women rabbis by synagogues that operate within the boundaries of their figurative jurisdiction, regardless of title.Times of Israel First Yeshivat Maharat Female Rabbi Hired by Orthodox Synagogue, 3 January 2016 Also in 2015, the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a ruling which allows women to give instruction on Jewish law and to issue halachic decisions. Beit Hillel claimed that this ruling was the first time women issuing halachic rulings was formally affirmed in a written responsa of Jewish law. Also in 2015, Jennie Rosenfeld became the first female Orthodox spiritual advisor in Israel (specifically, she became the spiritual advisor, also called manhiga ruchanit, for the community of Efrat.) Also in 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to Haredi women was unveiled, called \\"B'Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\\" In 2016 it was announced that Ephraim Mirvis created the job of ma'ayan by which women would be advisers on Jewish law in the area of family purity and as adult educators in Orthodox synagogues. This requires a part-time training course for 18 months, which is the first such course in the United Kingdom. In 2017, the Orthodox Union adopted a policy banning women from serving as clergy, from holding titles such as \\"rabbi\\", or from doing common clergy functions even without a title, in its congregations in the United States.  Women in Jewish religious law, clergy, schools, groups, and rituals  In 1845, rabbis attending the Frankfort Synod of the emerging Reform Judaism declared women count in a minyan, a formalization of a customary Reform practice dating back to 1811. In 1854, Fanny Neuda wrote the first Jewish prayer book known to have been written by a woman for women, called Hours of Devotion; it was translated into English and published in the United States 12 years later. In 2015 a plaque honoring her was unveiled in Lo≈°tice, where she lived while her husband was a rabbi there. In 1884, Julie Rosewald became America's first female cantor (though she was born in Germany); she served San Francisco's Temple Emanu-El, although she was not ordained. She served as a cantor there until 1893. Ray Frank became the first Jewish woman to formally preach in a synagogue in 1890 On 14 September 1890, Ray Frank gave the Rosh Hashanah sermon for a community in Spokane, Washington, thus becoming the first woman to preach from a synagogue pulpit, although she was not a rabbi. On 18 March 1922, the American rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan held the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah in the United States, for his daughter Judith, at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, his synagogue in New York City.Waskow, Arthur Ocean and Phyllis Ocean Berman. Excerpt from A Time for Every Purpose Under Heaven Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC at Judith Kaplan recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing. Kaplan, who at that time claimed to be an Orthodox rabbi, joined Conservative Judaism and then became the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, and influenced Jews from all branches of non-Orthodox Judaism through his position at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Also in 1922, Martha Neumark and her father attended the Central Conference of American Rabbis Conference, where she succeeded in convincing the CCAR to ordain women rabbis. The CCAR declared in a responsa in 1922, \\"...woman cannot justly be denied the privilege of ordination,\\" having voted 56 to 11 in favor of that statement. Yet the board of the college still refused to consider women for ordination, voting (as Neumark recalled) six laymen to two rabbis against it. Neumark thus earned a qualification as a religious school principal instead of ordination, though she had spent 7 and a half years in rabbinical school. Also in 1922 Irma Lindheim entered the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City, though she eventually left for the \\"greater cause of Zionism.\\" While there, in 1923, she petitioned the faculty to change her status from that of special student to a regular student in the rabbinic program; in response, in May of that year they unanimously recommended the admission of women to the institute on the same basis as men. Regina Jonas, the first formally ordained female rabbi In 1935, Regina Jonas became the first formally ordained female rabbi; she was ordained by the liberal Rabbi Max Dienemann, who was the head of the Liberal Rabbis' Association, in Offenbach am Main, Germany. In 1939, Helen Levinthal became the first American woman to complete the entire course of study in a rabbinical school, which she did at the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. Her thesis was on women's suffrage from the point of view of Jewish law. However, she only received a Master of Hebrew Letters (and a certificate recognizing her accomplishment) upon graduation, rather than a Master of Hebrew Letters and ordination as the men received, since the faculty felt it was not yet time for women's ordination as rabbis. In 1955, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism declared that women were eligible to chant the blessings before and after the reading of the Torah, a privilege called \\"Aliyah\\". However, in 1962, a study found that only eight conservative congregations had fully embraced the ruling while fifty implemented it with conditions and 196 congregations still had not adopted this newfound right of Jewish women. In the late 1960s, the first Orthodox Jewish women's tefillah (prayer) group was created, on the holiday of Simhat Torah at Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan. This development came by the judgement of the synagogue's rabbi, Shlomo Riskin. Further, the late 1960s saw Bat Mitzvahs, a public coming of age ritual for Jewish girls, become widespread after Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative Jews allowed women to partake in and lead a congregation in prayer. In 1973, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards passed a takkanah (ruling) allowing women to count in a minyan equally with men. Also in 1973, the United Synagogue of America, Conservative Judaism's congregational association (now called the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism) resolved to allow women to participate in synagogue rituals and to promote equal opportunity for women for positions of leadership, authority, and responsibility in congregational life. In 1974, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted a series of proposals that equalized men and women in all areas of ritual, including serving as prayer leaders. In the early 1970s, new rituals began popularizing. Jewish women staged public ceremonies for the birth of their daughters, sharing the ritual of \\"brit millah\\" which was historically reserved for newborn sons. They started forming special groups for prayer and study on Rosh Hodesh, the beginning of the new month, with their newfound freedoms to congregate. Women also contributed to the observance of Passover by placing a goblet of water, called \\"Miriam's cup\\", on the Seder table to include her, as Moses' sister, in the narrative of his exodus from Egypt with the Jewish people. In 1972 Sally Priesand became America's first female rabbi ordained by a rabbinical seminary, and the second formally ordained female rabbi, after Regina Jonas. Priesand was ordained by the Reform Jewish Seminary Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion on 3 June 1972, at the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati. Also in 1972, a group of ten New York Jewish feminists calling themselves Ezrat Nashim (the women's section in a synagogue, but also \\"women's help\\"), took the issue of equality for women to the 1972 convention of the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly, presenting a document on 14 March that they named the \\"Call for Change.\\" The rabbis received the document in their convention packets, but Ezrat Nashim presented it during a meeting with the rabbis' wives. The Call for Change demanded that women be accepted as witnesses before Jewish law, held obligated to perform all mitzvot, allowed full participation in religious observances, have equal rights in marriage and be allowed to initiate divorce, be counted in the minyan, and be permitted to assume positions of leadership in the synagogue and within the Jewish community. Paula Hyman, a member of Ezrat Nashim, wrote: \\"We recognized that the subordinate status of women was linked to their exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot (commandments), and we therefore accepted increased obligation as the corollary of equality.\\"Paula Hyman, Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution, Jewish Women's Archive. (2006) With supportive persuasion from Gerson Cohen, the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Rabbinical Assembly accepted their proposal in 1973 and the JTS in 1983. In 1973, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism voted to count men and women equally as members of a minyan. In 1974 Sandy Eisenberg Sasso became the first female rabbi ordained in Reconstructionist Judaism. In 1975, Barbara Ostfeld-Horowitz became the first female cantor ordained in Reform Judaism. Gloria Steinem, a prominent Jewish feminist attended Esther M. Broner's 1976 women-only seder In 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in Esther M.

Miriamscup.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. Miriam's cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Miriam's cup is linked to the midrash of Miriam's well, which \\"is a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt\\". Furthermore, some Jews include an orange on the seder plate. The orange represents the fruitfulness for all Jews when all marginalized peoples are included, particularly women and gay people. An incorrect but common rumor says that this tradition began when a man told Susannah Heschel that a woman belongs on the bimah as an orange on the seder plate; however, it actually began when in the early 1980s, while when speaking at Oberlin College Hillel, Susannah Heschel was introduced to an early feminist Haggadah that suggested adding a crust of bread on the seder plate, as a sign of solidarity with Jewish lesbians (as some would say there's as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a crust of bread on the seder plate).Jewish Rituals for On the Seder Table. Ritualwell.org. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. Heschel felt that to put bread on the seder plate would be to accept that Jewish lesbians and gay men violate Judaism like chametz violates Passover. So, at her next seder, she chose an orange as a symbol of inclusion of gays and lesbians and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community. In addition, each orange segment had a few seeds that had to be spit out‚Äîa gesture of spitting out and repudiating the homophobia of traditional Judaism. In 1978 Linda Rich became the first female cantor to sing in a Conservative synagogue, specifically Temple Beth Zion in Los Angeles, although she was not ordained. In 1979 Linda Joy Holtzman was hired by Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County, which was then located in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. She had graduated in 1979 from the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia, yet was hired by Beth Israel despite their being a Conservative congregation. Holtzman was thus the first woman to serve as a rabbi for a solely Conservative congregation, as the Conservative movement did not then ordain women. However, Sandy Eisenberg Sasso served as rabbi along with her husband at the congregation Beth-El Zedeck in Indianapolis from 1977 until 2013; Beth El Zedeck is identified with both the Reconstructionist and Conservative movements. In 1981 the Jewish feminist group \\"B'not Esh\\", Hebrew for \\"Daughters of Fire\\", was founded. As of 2011, this group meets for five days every year over Memorial Day weekend at the Grail, a Catholic laywomen's retreat center in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York. There they, to quote Merle Feld, one of their members, \\"explore issues of spirituality, social change, and the feminist transformation of Judaism\\". Also in 1981, Lynn Gottlieb became the first female rabbi ordained in Jewish Renewal. In 1983, the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), the main educational institution of the Conservative movement, voted, without accompanying opinion, to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors. Paula Hyman, among others, took part in the vote as a member of the JTS faculty. There had been a special commission appointed by the Conservative movement to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, which met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of 11 men and three women; the women were Marian Siner Gordon, an attorney, Rivkah Harris, an Assyriologist, and Francine Klagsbrun, a writer. Amy Eilberg became the first female rabbi ordained in Conservative Judaism in 1985. In disapproval of such developments, several members of the JTS separated in 1984 and formed the Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism. Later, in 1989, some of the dissidents founded the Institute of Traditional Judaism, an organization committed to \\"Genuine Faith and Intellectual Honesty\\", a direct counter-establishment to the liberation of women in religious practice and Jewish society In 1987 Erica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel became the first female cantors ordained in Conservative Judaism. However, the Cantors Assembly, a professional organization of cantors associated with Conservative Judaism, did not allow women to join until 1990. In 1997 Gail Billig became the first female president of a major Orthodox synagogue, at Congregation Ahavath Torah in Englewood, N.J. In 1999 Tamara Kolton became the very first rabbi (and therefore, since she was female, the first female rabbi) ordained in Humanistic Judaism. In 2001 Deborah Davis became the first cantor of either sex (and therefore, since she was female, the first female cantor) ordained in Humanistic Judaism; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped graduating cantors. In 2002, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism adapted a responsum by Rabbi David Fine, Women and the Minyan, which provides an official religious-law foundation for counting women in a minyan and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer. This responsum holds that although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have, as a collective whole, voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others. The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning. By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the halakhic tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners. Also in 2002, Sharon Hordes became the first cantor of either sex (and therefore, since she was female, the first female cantor) ordained in Reconstructionist Judaism. Also in 2002, Avitall Gerstetter, who lived in Germany, became the first female cantor ordained in Jewish Renewal (and the first female cantor in Germany). In 2005, the Kohenet Institute was founded by Rabbi Jill Hammer and Holly Shere. The Kohenet Institute, based at the Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center in Connecticut, offers a two-year course of study to women who are then ordained as Jewish priestesses.Kohenet: Hebrew Priestess Institute \\"Kohenet\\" is a feminine variation on \\"kohan,\\" meaning priest. The Kohenet Institute's training involves earth-based spiritual practices that they believe harken back to pre‚Äìrabbinic Judaism; a time when, according to Kohenet's founders, women took on many more (and much more powerful) spiritual leadership roles than are commonly taken by women today. A Jewish priestess may, according to Kohenet, act as a rabbi, but the two roles are not the same. In 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism adopted three responsa on the subject of niddah, which reaffirmed an obligation of Conservative women to abstain from sexual relations during and following menstruation and to immerse in a mikvah prior to resumption, while liberalizing observance requirements including shortening the length of the niddah period, lifting restrictions on non-sexual contact during niddah, and reducing the circumstances under which spotting and similar conditions would mandate abstinence.Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, Mikveh and the Sanctity of Family Relations, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006 Rabbi Susan Grossman, MIKVEH AND THE SANCTITY OF BEING CREATED HUMAN, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006 Rabbi Avram Reisner, OBSERVING NIDDAH IN OUR DAY: AN INQUIRY ON THE STATUS OF PURITY AND THE PROHIBITION OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH A MENSTRUANT, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006 Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, RESHAPING THE LAWS OF FAMILY PURITY FOR THE MODERN WORLD, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006 Also in 2006, Susan Wehle became the first American female cantor ordained in Jewish Renewal; however she died in 2009. In June 2009, Avi Weiss ordained Sara Hurwitz with the title \\"maharat\\" (an acronym of manhiga hilkhatit rukhanit Toranit) rather than \\"Rabbi\\". In February 2010, Weiss announced that he was changing maharat to a more familiar-sounding title \\"rabba\\". The goal of this shift was to clarify Hurwitz's position as a full member of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale rabbinic staff. The change was criticised by both Agudath Yisrael and the Rabbinical Council of America, who called the move \\"beyond the pale of Orthodox Judaism\\". Weiss announced amidst criticism that the term \\"Rabba\\" would not be used anymore for his future students. Hurwitz will continue to use the title Rabba and is considered by some to be the first female Orthodox rabbi.https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:KCRr-i6GiWEJ:columbusjudaism.org/wp- content/uploads/2010/08/Bulletin-for-website- May-2012.pdf+%22sally+priesand%22+%22first+reform+woman+rabbi%22&hl;=en‚â∑=us&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEESiSpc6F3OkisK4Sn_iip26YBRs9D0CBa9i6tdy0Tu- VJRDyMnlg84qQL1dLCGZG6YPhXvUm4AjaDkZr86Nk2vaNNsCN2e_PvlILFbeJR0eckiOekxNRor3PReBXOo1SwYH4msFp&sig;=AHIEtbRDDbGrmJUgRyB44ggo5-Ryvj3AAQ However Weiss said other graduates of Yeshivat Maharat, which he founded, would not receive the rabba title, but the maharat smicha. But in 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi. Also in 2009 Tannoz Bahremand Foruzanfar, who was born in Iran, became the first Persian woman to be ordained as a cantor in the United States. Also in 2009, Alysa Stanton became the first African-American woman ordained as a rabbi. In 2010 the first American women to be ordained as cantors in Jewish Renewal after Susan Wehle's ordination, Michal Rubin and Abbe Lyons, were both ordained. In January 2013 Tamar Frankiel became the president of the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, making her the first Orthodox woman to lead an American rabbinical school. The school itself is transdenominational, not Orthodox. In 2013 Malka Schaps became the first female haredi dean at an Israeli university when she was appointed dean of Bar Ilan University's Faculty of Exact Sciences. In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the Kaddish prayer in memory of their deceased parents. In 2013 SAR High School in Riverdale, New York began allowing girls to wrap tefillin during Shacharit-morning prayer; it is probably the first Modern Orthodox high school in the U.S. to do so. On 26 October 2014 Rabbi Deborah Waxman was inaugurated as the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and Jewish Reconstructionist Communities. Waxman is believed to be the first woman rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary. In 2014 the first ever book of halachic decisions written by women who were ordained to serve as poskim (Idit Bartov and Anat Novoselsky) was published. The women were ordained by the municipal chief rabbi of Efrat, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, after completing Midreshet Lindenbaum women's college's five-year ordination course in advanced studies in Jewish law, as well as passing examinations equivalent to the rabbinate's requirement for men. In 2014, Dr. Michelle Friedman became the first woman on the Beth Din of America's board of directors. In 2014, the first women were elected as national officers of the Orthodox Union; specifically, three female national vice presidents and two female associate vice presidents were elected. In June 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as \\"Rabbi\\". However, in the fall of 2015, the Rabbinical Council of America, representing over a thousand Orthodox rabbis across the United States, formally adopted a policy prohibiting the ordination or hiring of women rabbis by synagogues that operate within the boundaries of their figurative jurisdiction, regardless of title. Similarly, in the fall of 2015, the Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. Also in 2015 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a ruling which allows women to give instruction on Jewish law and to issue halachic decisions. Beit Hillel claimed that this ruling was the first time women issuing halachic rulings was formally affirmed in a written responsa of Jewish law. Also in 2015, Jennie Rosenfeld became the first female Orthodox spiritual advisor in Israel (specifically, she became the spiritual advisor, also called manhiga ruchanit, for the community of Efrat.) Also in 2015, Daryl Messinger became the first female chair of the Union for Reform Judaism. In 2016, after four years of deliberation, the Reform seminary HUC- JIR decided to give women a choice of wording on their ordination certificates, including the option to have the same wording as men.Why a small word change is a big deal for Reform women rabbis JTA, 31 May 2016 Up until then, male candidates' certificates identified them by the Reform movement's traditional \\"morenu harav,\\" or \\"our teacher the rabbi,\\" while female candidates' certificates only used the term \\"rav u'morah,\\" or \\"rabbi and teacher.\\" Rabbi Mary Zamore, executive director of the Reform movement's Women's Rabbinic Network, explained that the HUC was uncomfortable with giving women the same title as men. In 2012 she wrote to Rabbi David Ellenson, HUC's then president, requesting that he address the discrepancy, which she said was \\"smacking of gender inequality.\\" In June 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as \\"Rabbi\\". She officially became the first female Modern Orthodox rabbi in the United States of America when the Modern Orthodox Mount Freedom Jewish Center in Randolph, New Jersey hired her as a spiritual leader in January 2016. As of 2019, Kagedan is working as the rabbi at Walnut Street Synagogue. = Women as sofrot (scribes) = A Sofer, Sopher, Sofer SeTaM, or Sofer ST\\"M (Heb: \\"scribe\\", ◊°◊ï◊§◊® ◊°◊™◊¥◊ù) is a Jewish scribe who can transcribe Torah scrolls, tefillin and mezuzot, and other religious writings. (ST\\"M, ◊°◊™◊¥◊ù, is an abbreviation for Sefer Torahs, Tefillin, and Mezuzot. The plural of sofer is \\"soferim\\", ◊°◊ï◊§◊®◊ô◊ù.) Forming the basis for the discussion of women becoming soferim, Talmud Gittin 45b states: \\"Sifrei Torah, tefillin and mezuzot written by a heretic, a star-worshipper, a slave, a woman, a minor, a Cuthean, or an apostate Jew, are unfit for ritual use.\\" The rulings on Mezuzah and Tefillin are virtually undisputed among those who hold to the Talmudic Law. While Arba'ah Turim does not include women in its list of those ineligible to write Sifrei Torah, some see this as proof that women are permitted to write a Torah scroll.Tur, Orah Hayyim 271. However today, virtually all Orthodox (both Modern and Haredi) authorities contest the idea that a woman is permitted to write a Sefer Torah. Yet women are permitted to inscribe Ketubot (marriage contracts), STaM not intended for ritual use, and other writings of Sofrut beyond simple STaM. In 2003 Canadian Aviel Barclay became the world's first known traditionally trained female sofer. In 2007 Jen Taylor Friedman, a British woman, became the first female sofer to scribe a Sefer Torah. In 2010 the first Sefer Torah scribed by a group of women (six female sofers, who were from Brazil, Canada, Israel, and the United States) was completed; this was known as the Women's Torah Project. From October 2010 until spring 2011, Julie Seltzer, one of the female sofrot from the Women's Torah Project, scribed a Sefer Torah as part of an exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. This makes her the first American female sofer to scribe a Sefer Torah; Julie Seltzer was born in Philadelphia and is non-denominationally Jewish. From spring 2011 until August 2012 she scribed another Sefer Torah, this time for the Reform congregation Beth Israel in San Diego. Seltzer was taught mostly by Jen Taylor Friedman. On 22 September 2013, Congregation Beth Elohim of New York dedicated a new Torah, which members of Beth Elohim said was the first Torah in New York City to be completed by a woman. The Torah was scribed by Linda Coppleson. As of 2014, there are an estimated 20 female sofers in the world.  Women in Humanistic Judaism  Humanistic Judaism is a movement in Judaism that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people and encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish holidays and life cycle events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvah) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature. Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, Tamara Kolton, who was ordained in 1999. Its first cantor was also a woman, Deborah Davis, ordained in 2001; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors. The Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, \\"we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications.\\"Society for Humanistic Judaism - Reproductive Choice Abortion They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the then-recent passage of the \\"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\\" by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called \\"a direct attack on a woman's right to choose\\".Society for Humanistic Judaism Condemns Limit on Choice In 2012 they issued a resolution opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from generally applicable requirements mandating reproductive healthcare services to individuals or employees. In 2013 they issued a resolution stating in part, \\"Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of Women's Equality Day on 26 August to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow.\\" Since the mid 19th century, the role of Jewish women in humanistic efforts has also extended to Second-Wave feminism. For instance, Ernestine Rose, an associate of civil rights activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, led the push for women's rights to inherit property. As the daughter of a Polish rabbi, she simultaneously spoke out against anti-Semitism in her efforts. Additionally, Maud Nathan became a prominent voice in the suffrage movement of the early 20th century.  Israel  From 1918 to 1926 women in Palestine fought for representation in the Yishuv movement. This was seen as the first wave of feminism, before the state was established. In 1947 David Ben-Gurion agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed stating that (among other matters), known as the \\"status quo letter\\". In 1953 the Knesset enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 ‚Äì 1953.Bet Din and Judges Section 1 of the Law states, \\"Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts.\\" The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: \\"Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law\\" (din torah). However, a Muslim woman in Israel may petition for and receive a divorce through the Sharia courts without her husband's consent under certain conditions, and a marriage contract may provide for other circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A Muslim man in Israel may divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source. Christians in Israel may seek official separations or divorces, depending on the denomination, through ecclesiastical courts. In 1969, Golda Meir was appointed Israel's first female Prime Minister, during a time when women made up less than seven percent of the Knesset. In 1972 marks the creation of the first radical women's movement in Israel.< This period marks the beginning of second wave feminism in Israel. During the Yom Kippur war in 1973, women were not allowed in Military leadership, the civilian administration, and war production. However, women found other ways to become more actively engaged. Overall, the 1970s were a time of major growth and transition for feminism in Israeli society. In 2006, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that women should be allowed to deliver eulogies and that the burial societies, or chevra kadisha, should not impose gender segregation in the cemetery. The ruling was in response to an incident in Petach Tikvah in which a woman was stopped from eulogizing her father. However, the court's ruling was not backed up by the Religious Services Ministry until 2012, when Israel's Chief Rabbinical Council ruled that women can deliver eulogies at funerals, but that it is up to the community rabbi to decide on a case-by-case basis. In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a couple to marry civilly in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion. On 28 September 2010, the Israeli Supreme Court outlawed public gender segregation in Jerusalem's Mea Shearim neighborhood in response to a petition submitted after extremist Haredi men physically and verbally assaulted women for walking on a designated men's only road. However, in January 2011, a ruling of the Israeli High Court of Justice allowed the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period. In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the Kaddish prayer in memory of their deceased parents. Also in 2013, the minimum marriage age in Israel became 18 for females and males. Also in 2013, the Religious Judges Law in Israel was amended to say that at least four women must be included in the religious judges' nomination committee, including a female advocate in the religious courts, and that the total number of committee members shall be eleven.Israel Hayom  In a first, women to sit on rabbinic judges selection panel Also in 2013, Israel's Chief Rabbinate promised to remove the obstacles preventing women from working as supervisors in the state kosher certification system, and Emunah announced the first supervisor certification course for women in Israel. Also in 2013, the Minister of Religious Affairs and Chief Rabbis issued statements telling ritual bath attendants only to inspect women who want inspection, putting an end to forced inspections of women at mikvehs. Founding members of Women of the Wall in Jerusalem In May 2013, after Women of the Wall, led by Anat Hoffman, had engaged in civil disobedience to exercise freedom of religion, a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls at the Western Wall had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the Western Wall should not be deemed illegal. In October 2014 Women of the Wall smuggled in a Torah scroll to the Western Wall women's section and held their first Torah reading by a woman at the site, which was part of the bat mitzvah of Sasha Lutt. However, Shmuel Rabinowitz, the rabbi of the Western Wall, issued a statement saying in part, \\"In future, efforts will be made to ensure that this does not happen again, and the introduction of Torah scrolls will be banned for everyone - men and women.\\" In December 2014 some of the Women of the Wall became the first women to light menorahs at the Western Wall. Specifically, they lit 28 menorahs in the women's section of the Wall. Sarah Silverman was among those who attended the lighting of the menorahs. However, this event came after the rabbi in charge of the Western Wall had refused a request from Women of the Wall to place a menorah in the women's section. In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to Haredi women was unveiled, called \\"B'Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\\" Also in 2015, Tzohar (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the Israeli Bar Association, introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a get; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation. In 2016 it was announced that the High Court of Justice had given the Justice Ministry 30 days to formulate new regulations to allow women to compete equally with men for the position of director of rabbinical courts. Also in 2016, in a groundbreaking ruling, the Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court ordered a man jailed for thirty days for helping his son refuse to give his daughter-in-law a divorce for eleven years. Also in 2016, Karmit Feintuch became the first woman to be hired as a communal leader at an Orthodox synagogue in Israel (Ramban Synagogue). In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find \\"good cause\\" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Western Wall within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is \\"access to the Western Wall.\\"  Agunah  Agunah (, plural: agunot (◊¢◊í◊ï◊†◊ï◊™); literally 'anchored or chained') is a halachic term for a Jewish woman who is \\"chained\\" to her marriage. The classic case of this is a man who has left on a journey and has not returned, or has gone into battle and is MIA. It also refers to a woman whose husband refuses, or is unable, to grant her an official Jewish bill of divorce, known as a get. The problem of get-refusal became more widespread when Jews lived in countries where civil divorce was available, separate from religious divorce. Outside Israel, an agunah could obtain a civil divorce and remarry via civil marriage, as non-Israeli legal systems generally do not recognize the agunah status, but an agunah would not typically pursue a second marriage, since her first marriage is still valid according to halakha, therefore any other sexual relationships would constitute adultery from her first husband. Furthermore, according to halakha, any children born by an agunah are considered mamzerim (bastards). The earliest prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal was developed and accepted by the Rabbinical Council of Morocco on 16 December 1953.\\"Sefer Hatakanot\\", Vol. 1, The Institute for Moroccan Jewish Tradition, Jerusalem The prenuptial agreement gained further approbation in 1981 from Rabbi Shalom Messas, chief rabbi of Jerusalem.\\"Sefer Tevuot Shemesh\\", Jerusalem 1981 Following Rabbi Messas' involvement, the Rabbinical Council of America actively pursued this issue.\\"The RCA Commission: Solving the Problem of Gittin\\", Hamevaser, Vol. 22 No. 2, 27 October 1983 The latest in a series of RCA resolutions‚Äî\\"that since there is a significant agunah problem in America and throughout the Jewish world, no rabbi should officiate at a wedding where a proper prenuptial agreement on get has not been executed\\"‚Äîwas passed on 18 May 2006. In 2012 the International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF), an international organization of (as of 2012) 150 Modern Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution saying that, \\"IRF Rabbis may not officiate at a wedding unless the couple has signed a halachic prenuptial agreement. IRF Rabbis are further encouraged to participate ritually only in weddings in which the couple has signed a halachic prenuptial agreement. Ritual participation includes but is not limited to reading the ketubah, serving as a witness, and making one of the sheva berachot.\\" This makes the IRF the only Orthodox rabbinical organization in the world to require its members to use a halachic pre-nuptial agreement in any wedding at which they officiate. Beginning in the 1950s, some Conservative rabbis have used the Lieberman clause, named for Talmudic scholar and Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) professor Saul Lieberman, in the ketuba, requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons. In 1968, by a unanimous vote of the law committee, it was decided that the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative movement could annul marriages as a last resort, based on the Talmudic principle of hafka'at kiddushin. According to Rabbi Mayer Rabinowitz, the Chairman of the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative Movement, just the threat of this action was sometimes enough to compel the former husband to grant a get. In 1990 Agunah Day was established by ICAR - The International Coalition for Agunah Rights - to raise public awareness of the plight of the Agunah and galvanize action to solve the problem. It is observed on the Jewish calendar date of the Fast of Esther. In 1995 the Israeli parliament gave the rabbinical court expanded legal power to sanction men who refuse to give their wives a get by suspending their driver's licenses, seizing their bank accounts, preventing travel abroad and even imprisoning those who do not comply with an order to grant a divorce; however, women's groups say the 1995 law is not very effective because the court uses sanctions in less than 2% of cases. In 2004, Justice Menachem HaCohen of the Jerusalem Family Court offered new hope to agunot when he ruled that a man refusing his wife a get must pay her NIS 425,000 in punitive damages, because \\"[R]efusal to grant a get constitutes a severe infringement on her ability to lead a reasonable, normal life, and can be considered emotional abuse lasting several years.\\" He noted that \\"[T]his is not another sanction against someone refusing to give a get, intended to speed up the process of granting a get, and this court is not involving itself in any future arrangements for the granting of a get, but rather, it is a direct response to the consequences that stem from not granting a get, and the right of the woman to receive punitive damages.\\" This ruling stemmed from the Public Litigation Project initiated by the advocacy organization Center for Women's Justice as one of a number of successful lawsuits filed in Israeli civil courts claiming financial damages against recalcitrant husbands. In 2014 the Rabbinate of Uruguay instituted the requirement for all Jewish couples that marry under its auspices to sign a Rabbinic Pre-nuptial Agreement. The agreement states that in the case of the couple divorcing civilly, the husband is obligated to immediately deliver to his wife a get. The initiative was launched by Sara Winkowski, a director of the Kehila, the Comunidad Israelita del Uruguay (Jewish Community of Uruguay), who is also a Vice President of the World Jewish Congress and longtime activist for the rights of women within Jewish law. In 2015 Tzohar (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the Israel Bar Association, introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a get; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation. In 2018 the Knesset passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel's rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.

A native of Montana, he grew up in Missoula and Corvallis, Oregon. He was part of Reebok's \\"Dan & Dave\\" advertising campaign, with fellow decathlete Dan O'Brien, leading up to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, where he won a bronze medal in the decathlon. After retiring from competitive athletics he became a school teacher and administrator, serving as athletic director of Corban University in Salem, Oregon starting in 2009. Johnson accepted a position as Director with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes Oregon in June 2012. On November 14, 2012, Johnson resigned from Corban to devote more time to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He now coaches pole vault & hurdles at South Salem High School. Early life David Johnson was born in Missoula, Montana. As a child he attended C. S. Porter Elementary School and later attended Sentinel and would have graduated from Big Sky High School. Johnson's family moved to Corvallis, Oregon, in 1980, and he attended Crescent Valley High School, graduating in 1981. He was involved in a series of petty thefts as a teenager, primarily stealing soda pop and beer from local distributors with an assortment of childhood friends until one of them was caught and informed on the rest. He later detailed his experiences to reporters prior to the Barcelona Olympic games and used the material for his book and speaking tour as an example on how to turn one's life around. During adolescence Johnson was afflicted with Osgood-Schlatter disease in both knees that kept him from participating in high school sports for the most part. During his junior high years he excelled in track, touch football and was on a Kiwanis basketball team for two years. In elementary school he played organized Little League baseball and had some familiarity with boxing. Athletics Even as a child Johnson was naturally fit and coordinated from neighborhood activities. He first tried football and track his senior year in high school. He played college football at Azusa Pacific University as a safety in 1982 and 1983. At Azusa he started to compete in the decathlon ‚Äì at 6'2-1/2\\" (190 cm), he put his innate abilities and his constant physical training to use and began setting records. He graduated from the school in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, and later earned a master's degree in 2003 from the school in special education. After several years he was generally acknowledged as the best decathlete to date. At this time Dan O'Brien appeared on the scene and began to provide Dave with his first real competition. O'Brien and Johnson became good friends and consistently placed first and second in most events. O'Brien eventually began to be considered the best overall decathlete, but Johnson earned the recognition as the best at 2nd day events. Johnson was a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. For the 1992 Summer Olympics the team of \\"Dan & Dave\\" was promoted as the inevitable winners in the decathlon and the question of who would take first and who would be second was widely debated. Dan failed to qualify for the team when he no-heighted on the pole vault, leaving Dave as the presumed gold medal winner. Unfortunately, Johnson experienced a stress fracture in his left foot on the first day of events. He put on a shoe two sizes larger, laced it up tight, competed anyway and won the bronze medal. Johnson's endorsement career continued for at least a year after the Barcelona Olympic Games and included Oakley sunglasses, Pert shampoo, Ryder trucks, and Reebok shoes. Later life Johnson later retired from competition and became a motivational speaker as he finished a master's degree in Special Education. He also wrote the book \\"Aim High ‚Äì An Olympic Decathlete's Inspiring Story\\" with Verne Becker. Until 2006, Johnson worked at Jefferson High School as a special education instructor and assistant principal in Jefferson, Oregon. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, entering with fellow decathlon competitor Dan O'Brien.A \\"Dan & Dave\\" reunion ‚Äì The Portland Tribune, October 7, 2005. He also has a wife and four children. For a couple years in the early 2000s he taught at West Albany High School in Albany, Oregon. Johnson then became the athletic director at South Salem High School to the north in Salem. In June 2009, he was named as the athletic director of Corban University, a small private college in Salem. He resigned from the position in December 2012 to pursue a ministry position with FCA. Johnson accepted a position with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes Oregon in 2013 and is a volunteer and consultant coach with South Salem High School, Corban, Salem Track Club, and Oregon State University. In June 2017 Johnson and Dan O'Brien were the subjects of (and participants in) the ESPN Radio 30 for 30 podcast \\"The Trials of Dave and Dan\\" about the famous ad campaign and its aftermath.

The images may be automatically combined, for example into one high dynamic range image, or they may be stored separately so the best-looking pictures can be picked later from the batch. When the photographer achieves the same result by changing the camera settings between each shot, this is simply called bracketing. Parameter altered The bracketing is typically for one specific parameter: = Exposure= Exposure autobracketing (often abbreviated to AEB for automatic exposure bracketing or BR for Bracketing) is the most common form. In this, the camera is set to capture the same image several times with different exposure settings, both over-exposed and under- exposed (lighter and darker) compared to the current setting on the camera, which may already include exposure compensation. Depending on the camera, the difference between each of the autobracketed shots could be anywhere from one- quarter up to three full stops in each direction, in full, half, third or quarter stop increments, ranging from two up to nine shots in series. Sometimes it is possible to either define the order, in which the shots will be taken, or to give an offset as a start-point of the bracketing series. More sophisticated equipment allows auto-exposure bracketing to be combined with timer and intervalometer functions as well. Cameras can perform autobracketing by adjusting either the shutter speed (typically in aperture priority mode, sometimes also in manual or program mode) or the aperture setting (typically in shutter priority mode). In programmed exposure mode, many cameras will alter both parameters at the same time. Some cameras allow to swap the parameter used for shifting in manual mode. Digital cameras may also alter the ISO setting if auto-ISO is enabled. Exposure autobracketing is most commonly used with color reversal film (slide film) because of its small exposure latitude compared with print film (which has a wide exposure latitude) and digital cameras (which enable the photographer to review the captured image). In digital photography, autobracketing is convenient to shoot pictures for high dynamic range imaging. = Flash = Automatic flash bracketing (sometimes abbreviated to FBR for flash bracketing or FEB for flash exposure bracketing) is typically performed by altering the flash output of a connected dedicated flash accordingly. Using non-dedicated studio flashes, for example on the PC socket, flash bracketing can be carried out by altering the aperture, however, this will also affect ambient light and the depth of field. If, in manual mode, a camera defaults to alter the shutter speed, it might be necessary to swap the parameters used for shifting in order for the camera to alter the aperture instead. Since the flash may need time to recharge between the shots, some cameras fall back to single-advance drive mode during auto flash bracketing, even if they are otherwise configured for continuous-advance drive. = ISO = Automatic ISO bracketing simulates exposure bracketing by altering the ISO or signal gain prior to conversion of the image to JPEG or other image file format. The actual exposure values (aperture and shutter speed) are usually kept constant. Auto ISO bracketing is not a common feature of digital cameras. = White-balance = Another common form of autobracketing is white balance autobracketing (sometimes abbreviated to WBB for white balance bracketing); this applies only to digital cameras, not to film cameras. This function provides a way of dealing with mixed lighting by having the camera take one shot and process the raw sensor data several times for slightly different white point settings, with both higher and lower color temperatures (bluer and redder) compared to the current setting on the camera. Typically, the amount of offset can be configured. Since shooting in a camera's raw format (if supported) the white balance can be arbitrarily changed in postprocessing as well at a later stage, white balance bracketing is particularly useful for reviewing different white balance settings in the field. = Focus = 10 with the features of the fly closest to the camera. The center image shows the features farthest from the camera. The image on the right shows focus stacking: a sequence of six incrementally focused images of the fly assembled to make a composite image using CombineZM. = Depth of field= The Minolta Maxxum 7's STF function is an automatically calculated and pre-compensated seven-fold multi-exposure with depth-of-field bracketing which emulates the smooth bokeh effect of Smooth Trans Focus.  Dual- bracketing Some cameras which provide bracketing of two parameters at the same time.

On the south bank John Peter also leased the \\"Tubbo\\" run, a property he had formed in the 1850s by the amalgamation of several runs.

The Surveyor Townshend laid out reserves near the crossing-place during the 1850s. =Darlington Point and Waddai= Darlington Point branch office of Murrumbidgee Council In 1864 George Rogers acquired of \\"Cuba\\" station. He built the Darlington Inn about two miles (3 km) west of \\"Cuba\\" homestead at the junction of the Wagga Wagga to Hay road and the track leading to the river-crossing. Rogers soon became discontented; he sold out a year later and left the district. The new publican of the Darlington Inn was Jacob Abrahams. Another hotel (probably the Waddai Hotel) was built on the southern bank at the crossing (eventually leading to the development of the Waddai township).Jervis, James, 'The Western Riverina: A History of Its Development', Royal Australian Historical Society Journal and Proceedings, Vol. XXXVIII 1952, pp. 145-6; ‚ÄòDarlington Point‚Äô, The Age ‚Äì Travel. A report published in August 1865 claimed that Darlington Point, by \\"the growth of free selection\\", was \\"fast assuming the dimensions and appearance of a township\\"; there were two hotels, one on either side of the river, which the writer concluded \\"can hardly be regarded as a favourable sign\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 15 August 1865, p. 5. This report names the town as 'Darlington', but other sources verify that the name 'Darlington Point' was being used by that time by township residents. In 1866 a punt (previously operating at Wagga Wagga) was purchased for use at the Darlington Point-Waddai crossing; the owner of the punt was Jacob Abrahams, previously publican of the Darlington Inn, who had opened a general store at the township. The punt was said to be one of the largest in the colony, with the capacity to carry 1,700 sheep in a single trip. The licence of the Darlington Inn was held by Thomas Linsell from 1866 to 1868. Edward J. Flood held the licence of the Darlington Inn in 1869 (the last year this hotel appears in the annual list of licences granted).Jervis, James, 'The Western Riverina: A History of Its Development', Royal Australian Historical Society Journal and Proceedings, Vol. XXXVIII 1952, pp. 145-6; annual listings of publicans‚Äô licenses, New South Wales Government Gazettes. In about 1870 a second hotel was built on the southern bank at Waddai; for the year commencing 1 July 1870 Edward Grimley held the licence there for the Riverina Hotel. From mid-1871 Alexander Beaumont held the licence of the Waddai Hotel. The licences for the year commencing 1 July 1872 at both settlements were: Coach and Horses Hotel at Darlington Point (Keyran C. H. Cumming); Waddai Hotel (John White) and Riverine Hotel (Edward Grimley), both at Waddai. At Darlington Point by this stage the Coach and Horses Hotel had apparently replaced the Darlington Inn (possibly just a name-change). Keyran C. H. Cumming remained the licensee of the Coach and Horses Hotel at Darlington Point from 1871 to early 1879 (after which John Bowman held the licence). The licences for the two hotels at Waddai were held by a number of different persons over this same period.Annual listings of publicans‚Äô licenses, New South Wales Government Gazettes. In 1876 the steamer company McCulloch and Co. leased on the river where they established a wool receiving store, a general store and erected a small wharf. By 1880 the timber trade was booming with a high demand for railway timber; G. H. Risbey from Narrandera erected a small mill near Darlington Point to cut red-gum. Darlington Point Post Office opened on 1 November 1876. Darlington Point township was half a mile from the punt where, on the opposite bank, the southern township ‚Äì \\"called by the native name ‚ÄòWadai‚Äô\\" ‚Äì was located. In April 1881 it was reported that \\"Darlington and Wadai collectively contain a population of about 120\\". The adjoining townships had three hotels, three stores, \\"and the usual concomitants of a bush town\\".‚ÄòFrom Narrandera to Hay‚Äô by \\"The Raven\\", Town & Country Journal, 23 April 1881, page 792. From 1881 onwards it appears the Punt Hotel replaced the Riverine Hotel at Waddai (possibly a name-change of the existing hotel). The licences at both townships for the year commencing 1 July 1881 were: Coach and Horses Hotel at Darlington Point (John Bowman); Waddai Hotel (William Whyte) and Punt Hotel (James Slattery), both at Waddai. In 1882 a public school was opened with Mrs. J. Carroll in charge. In June 1882 it was reported that a move had been instigated to have the Government buildings removed to the south side of the river. By 1883 a post-office, courthouse, police barracks, school and telegraph service had been established at the township. As the town centre became established in the southern township the name 'Darlington Point' was eventually used for the settlements on both banks of the river. The town's main street is called Punt Road, a reminder of the public transport service that operated to ferry vehicles, stock and passengers across the river. The place-name of ‚ÄòWaddai‚Äô seems to have been transferred; the small cluster of buildings at the junction of Kidman Way and the Sturt Highway became known as Waddi. A lift bridge was built in 1905, joining the communities on either side of the river. The structure was replaced in 1979 by a concrete bridge. Part of the old bridge was reconstructed for the Australian Bicentenary celebrations and can now be found at the entrance to the Darlington Point Riverside Caravan Park which is located on a bend along the Banks of the Murrumbidgee River. =Warangesda Mission= :For more information, see Warangesda Aboriginal Mission St. Paul's Anglican Church where the Warangesda mission bell hangs. In 1880 the Rev. John Brown Gribble, a Congregational, later Anglican, minister, established an Aboriginal mission on \\"Warangesda\\" station, from Waddai township (near the crossing-place on the south bank). The New South Wales Government granted a reserve of for the purpose, which became known as the Camp of Mercy. The annual report of the Aborigines Protection Board for 1911 in regard to the mission reported \\"a quiet and uneventful year, though five convictions had been obtained for the supply of liquor to the Aborigines\\". As of 31 December 1911 there were 151 residents on the station, comprising \\"full- bloods: 26 adults and 5 children\\" and \\"half-castes: 73 adults and 47 children\\". The area of land under cultivation was , mostly of wheat but also including of barley. The yield included a quantity of hay and 40 bags of wheat.Narrandera Argus (newspaper), 6 December 1912. The Warangesda mission was closed by the Aborigines Protection Board in 1924 and the Aboriginal residents were moved to the 'police paddock', a plot of land behind the police station. The remains of an adobe building from this time can be seen in a paddock on \\"Warangesda\\" station (between Darlington Point township and the Sturt Highway). The mission bell now hangs in St Paul's Anglican Church in town. The Town Today Darlington Point today is a quiet little town, with a small shopping precinct, a swimming pool, two churches, a hotel, a club and a school. The town has a population of over 1000, with the majority living on the southern side of the river. Sporting activities include bowling and tennis, as well as being represented by the Darlington Point-Coleambally Roosters in the Group 20 Rugby League competition. The Darlington Point Solar Farm is located approximately 10 km south of the town. It is expected to be completed in 2020 and will be capable of generating 333MW (DC) or 275MW (AC). The Atlina Wildlife Park is located in the town.

With her husband, she co-founded the School of the Jewish Woman in New York City in 1933, and in 1939 founded the Jewish Spectator, a quarterly magazine, which she edited for 50 years. She was the author of 12 books, including Judaism and Christianity: The differences (1943), Toward Jewish-Muslim Dialogue (1967), and Freedom and Jewish Women (1977). Early life Weiss-Rosmarin was born in Frankfurt, Germany, the daughter of Jacob and Celestine (Mullings) Weiss. She attended the University of Berlin from 1927‚Äì28, and the University of Leipzig (1929), before obtaining her PhD in Semitics, philosophy, and archeology in 1931 from the University of W√ºrzburg for a thesis on ancient Arab history. While at university, she became active in Jewish and Zionist organizations. She emigrated in 1931 with her husband, Aaron Rosmarin (born 1904), to the United States, where they settled in New York City. The couple divorced in 1951. Writing and teaching Weiss-Rosmarin and her husband opened the School of the Jewish Woman in Manhattan in October 1933 under the auspices of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America. The school, which closed in 1939, was modeled on the Frankfurt Lehrhaus created by Franz Rosenzweig and Martin Buber, and aimed to combat what Weiss-Rosmarin saw as women's poor access to education. She and her husband offered classes in Torah, Jewish history, Hebrew, and Yiddish. Out of the school's newsletter grew the Jewish Spectator, which described itself as a \\"typical family magazine with a special appeal to women.\\" By means of her often controversial editorials, Weiss-Rosmarin sought to influence the American-Jewish community, arguing for changes in Jewish family law, Jewish‚ÄìArab co-existence in Israel, access to a Jewish education for women, and equality for women in the synagogue and in public life. An article Weiss-Rosmarin wrote for the Jewish Spectator in 1970, \\"The Unfreedom of Jewish Women,\\" was considered by historian Paula Hyman as a trailblazer in analyzing the status of Jewish women using feminism. Weiss-Rosmarin also wrote a regular column, \\"Letters from New York\\", in the London Jewish Chronicle and served as national co-chair of education for the Zionist Organization of America. She taught at New York University and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, and published books on a variety of subjects. She died of cancer in 1989.

The team planned to play in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The team would have played at the Bergen Ballpark, located on the site of the Xanadu Meadowlands project. The name \\"Cliff Hawks\\" refers to the raptors that inhabit the cliffs of the New Jersey Palisades which stretch through Bergen County.  History  East Rutherford, as all of Bergen County, is located adjacent to New York City. Bergen County does not have any professional baseball history of its own. Much of the fanbase for the New York Yankees and the New York Mets comes from the northern New Jersey area, and the city of Newark also has commanded attention for the older and newer inceptions of the Bears. Many of the residents of Bergen County will visit Yogi Berra Stadium and the New Jersey Jackals for minor league baseball. Since 2000 Steve Kalafer, a current investor of the Atlantic League, owner of the Somerset Patriots, and part-owner of the Camden Riversharks, tried to bring a professional baseball team to northern New Jersey. Initially the plan was for a new stadium to be built at one of two sites in Overpeck County Park. Opposition in Leonia, Ridgefield Park, and Fort Lee halted the plan within a few months. Kalafer then turned his attention to a different Ridgefield Park site just east of the New Jersey Turnpike. That proposal stalled as the Bergen freeholders opposed the issuance of $20 million in bonds for the ballpark. Kalafer then worked with the Mills Corporation to build a ballpark in conjunction with its Xanadu Meadowlands project. Over a period of five years, talks had deteriorated between Kalafer and the Mills Corp. After a failed lawsuit by Kalafer, the Cliff Hawks took a backseat to the Xanadu, and when Triple Five took ownership of the mall in 2011, the ballpark was officially cancelled, all but killing the Cliff Hawks.

Therefore the second condition, that be greater (or less) than zero, could equivalently be that or be greater (or less) than zero at that point. =Functions of many variables= For a function f of three or more variables, there is a generalization of the rule above. In this context, instead of examining the determinant of the Hessian matrix, one must look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at the critical point. The following test can be applied at any critical point a for which the Hessian matrix is invertible: # If the Hessian is positive definite (equivalently, has all eigenvalues positive) at a, then f attains a local minimum at a. # If the Hessian is negative definite (equivalently, has all eigenvalues negative) at a, then f attains a local maximum at a. # If the Hessian has both positive and negative eigenvalues then a is a saddle point for f (and in fact this is true even if a is degenerate). In those cases not listed above, the test is inconclusive.Kurt Endl/Wolfgang Luh: Analysis II. Aula-Verlag 1972, 7th edition 1989, , pp. 248-258 (German) For functions of three or more variables, the determinant of the Hessian does not provide enough information to classify the critical point, because the number of jointly sufficient second-order conditions is equal to the number of variables, and the sign condition on the determinant of the Hessian is only one of the conditions. Note that in the one-variable case, the Hessian condition simply gives the usual second derivative test. In the two variable case, D(a, b) and f_{xx}(a,b) are the principal minors of the Hessian. The first two conditions listed above on the signs of these minors are the conditions for the positive or negative definiteness of the Hessian. For the general case of an arbitrary number n of variables, there are n sign conditions on the n principal minors of the Hessian matrix that together are equivalent to positive or negative definiteness of the Hessian (Sylvester's criterion): for a local minimum, all the principal minors need to be positive, while for a local maximum, the minors with an odd number of rows and columns need to be negative and the minors with an even number of rows and columns need to be positive. See Hessian matrix#Bordered Hessian for a discussion that generalizes these rules to the case of equality-constrained optimization. Examples Critical points of f(x, y) = (x+y)(xy + xy^2) maxima (red) and saddle points (blue). To find and classify the critical points of the function : z = f(x, y) = (x+y)(xy + xy^2) , we first set the partial derivatives : \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = y(2x +y)(y+1) and \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y} = x \\\\left( 3y^2 +2y(x+1) + x \\\\right) equal to zero and solve the resulting equations simultaneously to find the four critical points :(0,0), (0, -1), (1,-1) and \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{8}, -\\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\right). In order to classify the critical points, we examine the value of the determinant D(x, y) of the Hessian of f at each of the four critical points. We have : \\\\begin{align} D(a, b) &= f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b) - \\\\left( f_{xy}(a,b) \\\\right)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2b(b+1) \\\\cdot 2a(a + 3b + 1) - (2a + 2b + 4ab + 3b^2)^2. \\\\end{align} Now we plug in all the different critical values we found to label them; we have :D(0, 0) = 0; ~~ D(0, -1) = -1; ~~ D(1, -1) = -1; ~~ D\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{8}, -\\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{27}{128}. Thus, the second partial derivative test indicates that f(x, y) has saddle points at (0, ‚àí1) and (1, ‚àí1) and has a local maximum at \\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{8}, -\\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\right) since f_{xx} = -\\\\frac{3}{8} < 0. At the remaining critical point (0, 0) the second derivative test is insufficient, and one must use higher order tests or other tools to determine the behavior of the function at this point. (In fact, one can show that f takes both positive and negative values in small neighborhoods around (0, 0) and so this point is a saddle point of f.)

The manga was serialised in Dengeki Daioh. A 2006 thirteen episode anime produced by Trinet Entertainment was adapted from the manga. Kagihime is one of many anime works influenced by Alice in Wonderland as the story focuses on the completion of a third Alice book, The Eternal Alice. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson is referred to as L. Takion and not as Lewis Carroll for reasons unexplained. Plot The story revolves around the lead of the story, Kirihara Aruto. It begins one night when Aruto is awake writing his own copy of The Endless Alice. Suddenly he sees a girl leaping through the night sky. Believing her to be the Alice he writes about, he leaves his house and follows her to a library. He sees her fighting with another girl, who is defeated. The former then steals the latter's story and disappears. The next day, she reveals herself as Arisugawa Arisu, the female lead of the story. She then explains that she is an Alice User, capable of transforming into a kemonomimi bunny girl that uses a key in fights against other Alice Users. The keys are used to unlock the stories in other Alice Users's hearts. She explains that if a girl loses her story that she can no longer be an Alice User; the overall goal of an Alice User is to defeat all others and finish the Endless Alice. The one who does so will be granted a wish. Later, Kirihara Kiriha, Aruto's little sister is introduced. Kiriha reveals herself as an Alice User and proceeds to fight Arisu. Aruto breaks up the fight and the two make peace. The trio agrees to help each other finish Endless Alice. The rest of the series follows their adventures together. Characters ; :The author of two Alice books that are in print and somewhat of an antagonist. His main goal is to get Alice Users to bring him stories of the other Alice Users that are defeated to expand his collection of stories to create Eternal Alice, a book that is rumored to grant wishes to whomever puts it together. He invites Arisu Arisugawa and Aruto Kirihara to a tea party; Aruto and Arisu venture to the house where it is rumored that Takion lived and pass through a mirror to the dimension where Takion resides. He passes himself off as Takion's successor and shows an interest in Aruto's abilities. He is accompanied by three servants: the librarian and two girls named \\"Alice.\\" It is suggested in the manga that Takion was used instead of the Alice book's original author Lewis Carroll because of how Takion is portrayed in the series. :The dimension where Takion resides is different from the Wonderland Space that Aruto and Arisu are capable of entering. ; :Arisu's Japanese name is written in hiragana and not in katakana, though her name bears strong similarity to Alice. She is first seen during the night by Aruto when he saw her pursuing a woman. They meet the next day at Aruto Kirihara's school where she admits to being a Seeker of Alice. Arisu quickly becomes friends with Aruto because of their mutual affinity for the Alice stories. Like all Alice Users, she is determined to finish the Endless Alice and be granted a wish. Very little is known about Arisu's past. This becomes more apparent as the series continues. Aruto finds out that Arisu does not have any memories before meeting him because she is a character that was created out of Aruto's imagination to replace his sister, whom he knew he could not love. :Like Aruto's sister Kiriha, they become outfitted in bunny girl costumes when entering the Wonderland Space. :Arisu is an experienced and dedicated Alice User. She has allowed herself to be kept from her mission and willingly become friends with two of her enemies, but she will eventually have to unlock them to finish the Endless Alice and get her wish. Unlike other characters, Arisu seems to share the same type of Key Sword as Kirihara. ; :Aruto, the male protagonist, is an avid fan of the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland novels: He is writing a fan fiction sequel. It is explained in the story that because of his fanaticism with Alice books, he is able to enter Wonderland Space, which is a dimension where Alice Users fight. He first talks to Arisu during a fight that she has with another girl in Wonderland Space. At his school the following day, he discovers that she is a fellow student. Arisu befriends Aruto and wishes to read his fan fiction at his house. However, Aruto's little sister notices them and quickly realizes who Arisu is. She becomes jealous of her as she loves her brother deeply and thinks of him as her boyfriend. Aruto has the power to copy and write the stories in people's hearts. Later in the series he is shown with the power to make characters in a story appear in the real world. He generally returns the written stories back to their owners in the Wonderland Space as he feels it's not his right to keep such a personal account. The girls who have their stories taken are not allowed to re-enter the Wonderland Space. :Throughout the series there is some degree of sexual tension between Arisu, Kirika, Asuka, and Kiraha. After receiving an invitation to a tea party, Arisu and Aruto find themselves trapped in a different Wonderland dimension created by L. Takion. Alice, one of two almost identical girls who are in the same dimension as Takion and both named Alice, creates a cage out of vines in the Alphabet Forest (reflecting what happened in the books) that can only be dispelled by a kiss from the heart. He escapes by kissing Arisu, but when Kiraha finds out, she becomes moody around them. In her jealousy, she almost gets him killed. ; :Kiraha, Aruto's younger sister, is attached to Aruto by a love for him, not as a brother, but as a lover. She claims that she does not like the Alice stories. Once it is revealed that she is an Alice User and when she fights Arisu, she admits that she wants to complete the Eternal Alice to make Aruto happy. She is often seen blushing around her brother, especially when he is kind towards her. Kiriha often competes with Arisu for Aruto's attention. Despite her dislike for Arisu, she agrees to work with her to complete the Endless Alice. She plans to use her wish to get her brother to fall in love with her. ; :Another Alice User. Unlike the others, she only became an Alice User for power. After battling Arisu (despite not seeming to care about the stories before the battle) and being saved by Kiraha, she agrees to help collect the stories to be closer to Kiraha. Kisa has stockpiled items that have been owned or touched by Kiraha in a cupboard at her house that she collects whenever possible. She also tries to get Kiraha to eat her food; she is seen kissing the food beforehand and/or eating the food after Kiraha has taken a bite as to receive an 'indirect kiss' from her. Kiraha is not aware of Kisa's stronger feelings towards her. Her key sword has the power of Water. ; :A researcher whose dream is to be the youngest person to achieve a Nobel Prize. She recruits Aruto, Kiraha, and Arisu to help her research those whose hearts have been seized by Alice (manga: Alice Syndrome), those capable of entering the Wonderland Space. When Kirika enters the Wonderland Space, she reverts to her younger self due to a tragic mishap she experienced while at that age. Her upbringing was solely focused on research and academic performance; until she met Aruto she had only one other known friend. Later in the series she loses her powers but agrees to help Aruto from the outside. Her key sword has the power of Wind. ; :A girl who accidentally wandered into the world of Alice users because of a terrible sense of direction. Akane should be fighting in the Anderson user world. Apparently, Akane hates Alice and wanted to make Alices (Alice Users) \\"pretty\\" by burning them. The reason she hates Alice is because in the past, a young lady taught Akane about Alice. However, that same lady was having a relationship with Akane's father. Akane's father left Akane's birth mother. Her key sword has the power of Fire. ; :Deviating away from the bunny girl costume, Asuka and her Key Sword are decorated in feathers after transforming. She is shown to be stronger than most of the other Alice Users. Kirika was defeated by Asuka and her story taken after having to live through the most traumatic experience of her life. Asuka's specialty attack is incapacitating her opponents by forcing them to relive horrible or powerful memories by using a feather which is shot into their chest. :She is shown for the first time after Kiraha wakes up from an implied erotic dream involving her brother, from the rooftops. Asuka was able to witness the dream as she comments on Kiraha. The next day she introduces herself to the group at school and requests to join them after explaining that she is also an Alice User. :Asuka is the most cunning of the group; her goal was to take all their stories from the beginning. Kirika was the only one to suspect her intentions. Releases * Collecting a story: Door of heart. Door of Secret. Open by this key.

Early life  Xavier Villaurrutia was born in Mexico City in 1903. He studied in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (National Preparatory School) and in the Escuela de Jurisprudencia (Jurisprudence School). During that time, he felt a certain affinity to writing so he decided to dedicate his life to writing literature. In 1928, he joined the grupo de los Contempor√°neos (Contemporaries). In 1935, he received a scholarship to study theatre at Yale University. Returning to Mexico in 1937, he started working for the local newspaper, Letras de Mexico. Along with Salvador Novo, they founded the magazine Ulises in 1927.  Professional achievements  Professionally, Villaurrutia worked for the Mexican literary review, Contempor√°neos (literally \\"Contemporaries\\"), from 1928 to 1931. Villaurrutia would later found the first experimental theater in Mexico. Notable works Villaurrutia's notable works include his poetic writings, beginning with Reflejos in 1926 and Nocturnos in 1933. Villaurrutia's writing becomes darker in his later poetic works: Nostalgia de la muerte (literally meaning \\"Nostalgia of death\\") in 1938, and D√©cima muerte (literally \\"tenth death\\") in 1941. It is unclear if this change was due to the increased turmoil in Europe that would lead to World War II or simply due to Villaurrutia's increasing age. The preoccupation with death in Villaurrutia's work climaxed with his 1941 play, Invitaci√≥n √† la muerte, the title of which can be literally translated to \\"Invitation to the death\\" (see \\"References\\" below regarding Dr. Raymond Marion Watkins's book which chronicles a history and analysis of this play, which Watkins demonstrates was heavily influenced by Villaurrutia's integration of dramatic elements traceable to William Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet.\\") The final published work of Villaurrutia came posthumously in 1953 with the publication of Poes√≠a y teatro completos, a collection of his works which included the short theatrical dramas, Autos profanos. In 1993, Copper Canyon Press published Eliot Weinberger's translation of Nostalgia for Death along with Esther Allen's translation of Octavio Paz's Hieroglyphs of Desire, a book-length study of Villaurrutia's work. Inspiration Xavier Villaurrutia was greatly influenced by the work of Ram√≥n L√≥pez Velarde as well as by several other Mexican poets. He has been a major influence for many poets, including Octavio Paz (who was his student) and Al√≠ Chumacero. Commemoration Since 1955, there has been a Xavier Villaurrutia Award for literary works published in Mexico, selected by a jury of writers. This award has been sponsored by the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes since 1991.El Premio Xavier Villaurrutia - in Spanish  References   Links  * The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.

DeStefano (died April 8, 2008, in Naples, Florida) was an American sculptor, painter and businessman. Born in Avellino, Italy, he immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts with his family at the age of six. DeStefano studied at the North Bennett Street Industrial School and earned a scholarship to attend the School of the Museum of Fine Arts but was forced to drop out after two years due to a lack of funds. In 1933, while still a student, DeStefano created a cast bronze bas-relief profile portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that is located in the Roosevelt Room of the White House and is highlighted by tour guides. Former Boston mayors James Michael Curley and John F. Fitzgerald and two local businessmen provided the funds for the bronze and for DeStefano to travel to Washington D.C. to personally present the work to Roosevelt. Many of DeStefano's future subjects were also of a civic nature. During the Great Depression, DeStefano worked as an art teacher and on projects for the federal Works Projects Administration jobs program. Although his lifelong ambition was to be a professional artist, DeStefano felt that he could not support his family with his artwork. In 1937, DeStefano established a business, DeStefano Studios House of Mannequins, which restored and created mannequins for local department stores. During World War II, DeStefano served in the United States Navy in the South Pacific as a member of the 58th Seabee Battalion. He returned to his business after the war and continued to make mannequins commercially until his retirement in the 1980s. By the late 1970s, DeStefano's factory in Woburn, Massachusetts produced over 3,000 mannequins a day for stores such as Jordan Marsh, Filenes and Lord and Taylor. In a 1979 profile, the Boston Globe referred to DeStefano as \\"the dean of local mannequin makers.\\" As an artist, DeStefano worked in cast bronze, terra cotta and stone. His sculptures are displayed at Plimouth Plantation and at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.

The college serves over 1,800 students with professional undergraduate programs in nursing, business, communication, and education and graduate degree programs in nursing, business, TESOL and education. It is under the care of the Sisters of Charity of New York, one of several Sisters of Charity congregations of Catholic women that trace their lineage back to Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton. History 1861 in Central Park The college was founded in 1847 as the Academy of Mount Saint Vincent, a school for women. It took its name from Saint Vincent de Paul, the 17th-century French priest who worked with the poor and founded the original Sisters of Charity, and from the geographic high point along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan known as McGowan's Pass. When New York City began acquiring land for Central Park in 1855, the sisters, under the leadership of Mother Angela Hughes, sister of Archbishop John Hughes, purchased the \\"Fonthill\\", the estate of famed Shakespearean actor Edwin Forrest, in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx. On April 25, 1865, the funeral train carrying Abraham Lincoln back to Springfield, Illinois passed by the College. In 1911, the academy became a degree-granting institution, and changed its name to the College of Mount Saint Vincent. The Campus Record, the original college newspaper (named the Alembic in 1970), published its first issue in 1922. Just five years later, the first issue of the college's literary magazine, the Fonthill Dial, was published. The end of the decade saw the first issue of the college yearbook, the Parapet. In 1943, the college began working in conjunction with St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City to provide a nursing education program for its students. In 1964 the Mount joined forces with Manhattan College in a cooperative program that ran until 2006. Also in 1964, the Mount granted its first degrees in Fine Arts. In 1974, the College of Mount Saint Vincent became a co-educational institution, as it began admitting men. In 1976, the College Emeritus program was started to provide courses for mature students. The Mount began offering a new baccalaureate nursing program in 1975. It integrated business as an independent major in 1983. In 1988, almost 80 years after the college first amended its charter to confer Master of Science degrees. At the end of the decade, in 1989, the honors program was established. Campus buildings =Fonthill Castle= The Fonthill Castle, dramatically sited above the Hudson River, was the centerpiece of the estate of actor Edwin Forrest. Forrest built Fonthill in Riverdale, the Bronx, New York, from 1848 to 1852 for his wife, but before they could occupy it, they divorced and Forrest sold the estate to the Sisters of Charity. Fonthill was named after the castle of William Beckford (the younger) in England, Fonthill Abbey. The design of Mr. Forrest's Fonthill Castle has been attributed to Thomas C. Smith of New York City. The castle housed the college library from 1942 to 1968. Fonthill once formed the architectural symbol of the college and housed the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Today, Fonthill is vacated due to damage it has suffered throughout the years. =The Villa= One of the original buildings on site, the Villa (or gardener's cottage) was built of ashlar, sometime prior to 1856 in mid-19th century \\"bracketed\\" style. From 1887 to 1911 the \\"Stone Cottage\\" (originally called \\"Lourdes Villa\\") housed the St. Aloysius Academy for Boys. Many of the boys attending had sisters who were students at Mt. St. Vincent Academy. Actor Lionel Barrymore enrolled at the age of 10. At the turn of the century, American playwright Eugene O'Neill was enrolled in 1895 and received his First Communion in the Chapel in 1900. In 1911 the Villa, which no longer educated boys, was used as a college residence for the ladies. Today the Villa, is the home for several members of Sisters of Charity of New York. =Founders Hall= Founders Hall was built between 1857 and 1859 and subsequently expanded in 1865, 1883, 1906‚Äì1908, and in 1951. The original building is a five-story red brick building on a fieldstone base. It features a six-story square tower topped by a copper lantern and spire. The tower is flanked by five story gabled sections. The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception was enlarged to its present size in 1874. The crucifixion scene over the altar was painted by Constantino Brumidi, who also worked on the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. The stained glass windows were created by Mayer of Munich. The organ was built by Hilborne L. Roosevelt of New York City in 1873.\\"Hilborne L. Roosevelt\\", The New York City Organ Project In 1877, Thomas Edison came to campus to demonstrate inventions for the Academy students in South Hall. In 1978 a former locker room in the Administration Building was converted into Cahill Lounge. The Administration Building was listed on National Registrar of Historic Places in 1980. Today, The Administration Building has been renamed to \\"Founders Hall\\" in honor of all those who founded the college. A fire started in half of Founders Hall in the summer of 2014 and the damage was restored later during the school year. =Maryvale= Maryvale was constructed in 1859; it originally served as a laundry. In 1906 the laundry moved to the newly constructed Rosary Hall and Maryvale housed science classes. In 1954, Science classes moved to the new science building and Maryvale became the Library Annex and Studio Annex. Today, it mainly houses the communications and fine arts departments. Maryvale features a radio studio and a TV studio. The radio shows streams live on livestream. The TV studio is where students film the school's news program, Mount Saint Vincent News. =Lourdes Grotto= In 1873 the Lourdes Grotto was built. It is now considered the oldest outdoor grotto still in existence in the United States. The grotto is situated on a little island in a small lake in an area at one time known as \\"Lourdes Park\\".Brown, Mary Josephine. College of Mount Saint Vincent: A Famous Convent School, P.J. Kenedy & Sons, New York, 1917 =Le Gras Hall= In 1875, Le Gras Hall, named after Louise le Gras de Marillac, was built as St. Vincent Free School for the Catholic Children of Riverdale. This brought more young children onto the campus which at that time was filled with orchards and vegetable gardens. In 1911, with the opening of a parochial school in Riverdale, Le Gras was remodeled to house the college gymnasium with an auditorium on the second floor. It also housed the commuter students' cafeteria. In 1931 the library moved from the Administration building to Le Gras, before relocating in 1942 to Fonthill Castle. In 1951, the commuter students' cafeteria moved from Le Gras Hall to the first floor of the Administration Building. Today, Le Gras Hall is the headquarters for the Sisters of Charity of New York. =Rosary Hall= In 1906, Rosary Hall was constructed to house the boiler and laundry. The Sisters made room for the new building by using land in the lower orchard. Today, several sisters from the Sisters of Charity of New York currently resided in Rosary Hall. =Grace Center= In 1930, Hayes Auditorium and Gym were built on the site of the vegetable field. This building was renovated in the early 1990s and is now known as the Grace Center. =Peter Jay Sharp Athletic and Recreation Center= Opened in 2009, the Sharp Center offers 50,000 square feet of recreational space and houses the College's basketball courts, fitness center, and athletic offices. In 2016, the college placed solar panels on top of the roof of the Sharp Center. =Science Hall= In 1954, science classes moved from Maryvale to the new Science Hall on the hill, which had been built on the former sports field. In 2013, the College renovated the building making state of the art. =Elizabeth Seton Library= In 1968, the new Elizabeth Seton Library, or Seton Library, was opened. The College's community spirit was evident as many books were moved from the Castle to Seton Library via a human chain stretching up the hill.The library is named after Saint Elizabeth Seton, the first native-born American to be canonized. Elizabeth Seton founded the Sisters of Charity. =Residence halls= * The corner stone of the Italian Renaissance-style Seton Hall was set by John Cardinal Farley in November 1911. * In 1920 the Sisters purchased the adjacent Randolf estate and renamed the house Marillac Hall after Louise le Gras de Marillac who was declared a saint that year and had been instrumental in the foundation of the Daughters of Charity. In 1922 the north wing was added to the residence hall, and in 1924 the south wing. * In 1962, the cornerstone was laid for Spellman Hall. * The cornerstone was laid for the Alumnae Hall in 1965. * Matronardi Hall was built in 2007 and houses over 190 students.

Types of fiberboard (in order of increasing density) include particle board or low-density fiberboard (LDF), medium-density fiberboard (MDF), and hardboard (high-density fiberboard, HDF). It is sometimes used as a synonym for particle board, but particle board usually refers to low-density fiberboard. Plywood is not a type of fiberboard, as it is made of thin sheets of wood, not wood fibers or particles. Fiberboard, particularly medium-density fiberboard, is heavily used in the furniture industry. For pieces that will be visible, a veneer of wood is often glued onto fiberboard to give it the appearance of conventional wood. In the packaging industry, the term \\"fiberboard\\" is often used to describe a tough kraft-based paperboard or corrugated fiberboard for boxes. \\"Fiberboard\\" is also an intermediate product, an output of a pulp mill used as input for a paper mill. Manufacture Fiberboard manufacture begins with wood chipping: fresh or recycled wood material is cut and sorted to small pieces of similar size. Chips are washed to remove things such as dirt and sand. Metal scraps such as nails can be removed with a magnet placed over a conveyor belt on which the chips move forward. In the case of, for example, MDF (medium density fiberboard) and not particle board, chips are then steamed to soften them for defibration. Small amount of paraffin wax is added to the steamed chips and they are transformed into fluffy fibers in a defibrator and soon afterwards sprayed with adhesives such as urea-formaldehyde (UF) or Phenol formaldehyde resin (PF). Wax prevents fibers from clumping together during storage. Chips in the case of particle board are also sprayed with a suitable adhesive before the next steps. Fibers or chips are arranged into a uniform \\"mat\\" on a conveyor belt. This mat is pre-compressed and then hot-pressed. Hot-pressing activates the adhesive and glues the fibers or chips together. Board is then cooled, trimmed, sanded and maybe veneered or laminated. UF resins are dominantly used in the MDF industry because of their low cost and fast curing characteristics. However, pressures on the use of UF resins are mounting steadily due to potential problems associated with formaldehyde emission. On the other hand, PF resins are more durable and do not emit formaldehyde after cure. The industry has traditionally shied away from using PF resins due primarily to their higher cost and much slower curing rate than UF resins. However, the press times for PF-bonded fiberboard can be substantially reduced by manipulating the fiber mat temperatures, molecular weight distribution of PF resins and pressing parameters. As a result, the press times for PF-bonded fiberboard can be made comparable to those for UF-bonded fiberboard. Also, the resin content required for PF-bonded fiberboard is less than 5% to achieve a good board quickly. This is considerably lower than that required for UF- bonded fiberboard. Certain types of fiberboard can be considered \\"green\\" building products. Consisting of bio-based, secondary raw materials (wood chip or sugarcane fibers) recovered from within of manufacturing facilities, the binding agent used in this type of fiberboard is an all-natural product, consisting of vegetable starch containing no added formaldehydes. Use Fiberboard, classified by ASTM C208, Standard Specification for Cellulosic Fiber Insulating Board,ASTM C208 -95(2001) Standard Specification for Cellulosic Fiber Insulating Board has many benefits and is used in residential and commercial construction. Applications include: * sound proofing/deadening * structural sheathing * low-slope roofing * sound deadening flooring underlayment Fiberboard is also used in the automotive industry to create free-form shapes such as dashboards, rear parcel shelves, and inner door shells. These pieces are usually covered with a skin, foil, or fabric such as cloth, suede, leather, or polyvinyl chloride.

His students are San-Chuu, Yukke, Kuppa, Nam-Uru, Yonfa, Koyuu and Gunte.Tekken Chinmi Legends 38 v10, Page 20, Chinmi's Students : San-Chuu, Yukke, Kuppa, Nam-Uru, Yonfa, Koyuu and Gunte Jin Tan is also often described as Chinmi's student.Tekken Chinmi Legends 38 v10, Page 33, \\"We shouldn't slack off\\" Tekken Chinmi Chinmi is a young Chinese boy who was helping his sister in small restaurant business. He is talented in martial arts, and used to play with his pet monkey named Goku in the forests, giving him great agility. After defeating people who harasses his sister's restaurant, an old master (usually referred as 'Old Man/R≈çshi') witnessed his talent. Believing Chinmi is the one prophesied to become a great master of martial arts, R≈çshi arranged for him to train at Dairin Temple. From there, Chinmi learned Kung Fu, or Dairin Kenpo.

Chinmi tasted true defeat for the first time against Oudow, but later the old Master/Roushi told him the secret of Dairin Temple's forbidden move: the Thunder God Fist (Raijin Ken; Èõ∑Á•ûÊã≥), one that could instantly kill the victim. Despite his best efforts, Chinmi is cornered and used the forbidden move, crippling Oudow. Believing he just violated the sanctity of Dairin by killing his opponent, Chinmi goes on a self-imposed exile. Fortunately for him, he found out that Oudow actually survived and as a result softened his attitude, enabling Chinmi to truly return to the Temple. He is later promoted to teacher. As a teacher, Chinmi garnered a group of students, including the notorious and rebellious Gunte; though he later becomes enchanted with Chinmi's bravery and virtue to actually be more tolerant with his friends. After reacquainting with his students, Chinmi was thrust into the next saga where he fought the Wind Wolves army of horsemen (Fictional race based on the nomadic Mongolian and Manchurian tribes), who set their sights on Gunte's hometown. His deeds were noticed by the general of Chinese army and invited him to meet the Emperor. En route to the capital, Chinmi attended his sister's wedding. The Emperor invites him to participate in the upcoming annual national tournament of martial arts. While boarding with General Ourin's family, he developed a close friendship with the General's daughter, Renka. As the tournament begins, Chinmi was reunited with Xu Fang, but it turns out that he was brainwashed by an assassin who plotted to use him to kill the Emperor. Chinmi also befriended Dan Dan, a youth experts in martial arts solely based on kicking. Chinmi and Xu Fang reached the tournament finals, and Xu Fang's puppet master, Sinsai, kidnapped Renka and blackmailed Chinmi. Dan Dan inadvertently overhears the plot and rescued Renka, allowing Chinmi to restore Xu Fang's mind in the final battle and foiling the assassin's plot to kill the Emperor.

The first and second of four opening stages occurred on October 25, 2019, and on December 5, 2019. The remaining opening stages occurred on October 1, 2020 and afterwards. The project was first proposed in 2003 by the Mills Corporation as the Meadowlands Xanadu, with construction beginning in 2004. After the Mills Corporation's bankruptcy in 2007, the project was taken over by Colony Capital. In May 2009, construction stalled due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Triple Five Group announced intent to take over the mall in May 2011, and on July 31, 2013, officially gained control of the mall and the surrounding site.Nicholaides, Kelly (August 2, 2013). \\"American Dream Meadowlands handed over former Xanadu project in East Rutherford\\". NorthJersey.com After a series of ownership changes, financing issues, construction delays, and legal challenges, construction stopped again in December 2016. In late June 2017, construction had resumed, after new financing had been secured, though the project would suffer a series of \\"chronically delayed\\" opening dates. Among the attractions that opened in 2019 were the Nickelodeon Universe theme park in October and the Big Snow American Dream ski slope in December. The DreamWorks Water Park, which was scheduled to open March 19, 2020, as well as the mall's retail shops and restaurants, were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the mall's temporary closure on March 8. Following Governor Phil Murphy's August 26 announcement that amusements could open with restrictions on September 1, Big Snow American Dream announced it would reopen on that date, while other amusements and the mall's first major retail outlets reopened on October 1. History =Meadowlands Mills (1994‚Äì2002)= The exterior of the indoor ski slope in 2009 The Mills Corporation first began working on plans for a mall in the New Jersey Meadowlands in 1994. Meadowlands Mills, as it was called, would have been constructed on the Empire Tract, an area of of wetlands in Carlstadt, New Jersey. The tract was owned by Empire Ltd., a company which had purchased the land in 1961 and had been planning a major development since 1987.Hendry, Cheryl Ann. \\"Finding Nature in an Industrial Swamp: A Case Study of New Jersey's Hackensack Meadowlands\\", p. 196, Montana State University, 2017. The commercial development would have consisted of of retail space, a hotel, and of office space on of the tract. To mitigate the heavy environmental impact, the remainder of the tract would have been converted into stormwater retention basins. After Empire and Mills announced their proposal in 1996, the project quickly became controversial and faced opposition from a variety of environmental and conservationist groups, as well as the tract's congressman, Steve Rothman. Opponents stated that the mall would have a devastating impact on the ecological health of the area, while the Mills Corporation defended its plans by arguing that the land was already devastated by pesticide usage and invasive common reeds.Jacobs, Andrew (December 18, 2000). \\"Shops vs. Swamps In the Meadowlands; Debate Over a Huge Shopping Mall Marked by Rival Claims and Spin\\". The New York Times.\\"Mall plan forces a look at future of Meadowlands; Developers argue that parts of N.J. wetland are not worth saving\\", The Baltimore Sun, April 15, 1998. The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposed the project after studying its potential environmental impact. However, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted its own study which contradicted the EPA's findings and stated that the project was not a threat to the Meadowlands area. New Jersey governor Donald DiFrancesco announced plans to protect the area in 2001, encouraging the Mills Corporation to look at other potential sites in the region.Jacobs, Andrew (March 21, 2001). \\"DiFrancesco Seeks to Save Meadowlands\\". The New York Times. His successor, Jim McGreevey, informed Mills the following year that the state government would not provide permits for the mall, effectively ending the project as originally proposed.\\"The Facts Regarding the Conservation of the Empire Tract\\", Hackensack Riverkeeper, 2005. The Empire Tract was later permanently protected by the Meadowlands Conservation Trust, which purchased it in 2005 and renamed it the Richard P. Kane Natural Area after a noted New Jersey conservationist. =Meadowlands Xanadu (2002‚Äì2010)= In July 2002, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) issued a request for proposal for a project in the area that was then the parking lot of the Continental Airlines Arena. The request was inspired by the Meadowlands Mills project as well as by plans to move the New Jersey Nets out of the arena, and involved significantly less environmental damage because it would be built on already developed land. The Mills Corporation retooled its earlier proposal for Meadowlands Mills to fit the new site, and partnered with Mack-Cali Realty Corporation to design Meadowlands Xanadu, a major multi-use development which would incorporate a renovated Continental Airlines Arena.\\"Xanadu Project (Continental Airlines Arena Site Redevelopment)\\", Teterboro Online, 2005. The name was taken from Mills Corporation's Madrid Xanad√∫, a shopping mall in Spain which opened in 2003. NJSEA accepted several other proposals for developing the site. Westfield Group proposed Arena Place, an \\"urban village\\" and \\"town square\\" built around the arena. Hartz Mountain Industries and Forest City Realty Trust submitted plans for Expo Park at the Meadowlands, featuring an outlet mall, a convention center, an indoor racetrack, and three hotel buildings. Triple Five Group proposed MeadowFest America, which planned an adaptive reuse of the arena to create a retail and entertainment complex.Smothers, Ronald (September 20, 2002). \\"New Ideas Unveiled for Site of Meadowlands Arena\\". The New York Times.Pries, Allison. \\"American Dream: The 16-year (and counting) journey of a mega-mall that might actually open kind of soon\\". NJ.com. June 19, 2018. Retrieved January 25, 2019. Other proposals focused on the project's location in the Meadowlands Sports Complex. International Speedway Corporation envisioned plans for Sports City America, a development centered around the proposed Garden State International Speedway, a NASCAR racetrack seating 80,000. A consortium that included Paul Newman, Carl Haas, and Mario Andretti proposed Liberty Speedway and Family Theme Park, combining a racetrack with an amusement park and connecting the two with a monorail.\\"Continental Airlines Arena site Redevelopment Proposals\\", Teterboro Online, 2002. In February 2003, the authority's board chose Mills Corporation and Mack-Cali's plan over the other two finalists, Westfield Group and Hartz Mountain Industries. The project was billed by Mills chairman and executive officer Laurence E. Siegel as \\"...a new standard for bringing lifestyle, recreation, sports and family entertainment offerings together in one location.\\" Ground was broken on the complex on September 29, 2004, and, at the time, was expected to open two years later. In November 2006, Colony Capital purchased the project from Mills Corporation for $500 million and pushed the projected opening to 2008. By 2008, the colorfully gaudy exterior of the building, which is visible from the New Jersey Turnpike and New Jersey Route 3, began to draw criticism as an eyesore. Richard Codey, president of the New Jersey State Senate at the time, called the structure \\"yucky-looking\\". In 2011, then-Governor Chris Christie called it \\"an offense to the eyes as you drive up the turnpike\\" and \\"by far the ugliest damn building in New Jersey, and maybe America.\\" After acquiring the project, Triple Five indicated the exterior would be repainted in a different color scheme.Brennan, John (February 21, 2013). \\"Work on American Dream complex set to resume in March, official says\\".

(and whose common areas were about 88% complete), came to a halt after a subsidiary of bankrupt Lehman Brothers missed payments, causing other lenders to withdraw from the project, and lost $500 million worth of construction funding. Developers stated the mall was 70% leased at the time. In March 2009, the retailer Cabela's announced that it did not plan to open its Meadowlands location for another year, and subsequently gave \\"late 2010\\" as an estimated opening date. It would later pull out of the project by November 2010, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a halt to construction.Bagli, Charles V. (November 26, 2010). \\"A New Push to Rescue Xanadu Mall Project\\". The New York Times. Retrieved January 2, 2019. In February 2010, Stephen Ross, owner of The Related Companies in Manhattan, stated that he could finish the project by the end of 2010, possibly with a new name and look. In May 2010, the NJSEA handed the project over to the Related Companies, and the \\"Xanadu\\" name had been dropped, changing the name to \\"The Meadowlands\\". In May 2010, the project's name was shortened from \\"Meadowlands Xanadu\\" to simply \\"Meadowlands.\\"\\"Stalled Meadowlands Xanadu project gets new funding, shortens name to just 'Meadowlands'\\". The Star- Ledger/NJ.com. May 14, 2010. Retrieved January 2, 2019. On August 10, 2010, Colony Capital surrendered control of the development of the mall to five lenders. Four parties were noted to be interested in redeveloping the project. The Wall Street Journal on December 24, 2010, reported that Triple Five Group signed a letter of intent to invest in and finish the stalled mall. Triple Five proposed that the mall be expanded to include indoor amusement and a water park. Developers cut a deal with Deutsche Bank to provide an approximately $700 million loan to finish the project. Sheraton in 2009 On February 1, 2011, after a record-breaking month of snow for the area,\\"Snowstorm Shatters New York City, Philadelphia Records\\" . AccuWeather.com. January 27, 2011. a 50- to 60-foot-long section of the eastern wall had buckled, and a horizontal crease was apparent on the complex's indoor ski slope. Two days later, on February 3, after workers were attempting to melt snow from the ski slope's roof, ice build-up caused the eastern wall to fail and suffer a partial collapse along an approximately length of roof. Michael Beckerman, a spokesman for the project's lending group stated, \\"The Lender Group is aware of the damage to the roof caused by excessive snow and ice, but does not feel the damage affects the integrity of the structure. As such, the group has filed an insurance claim, and once the weather turns warmer, it will assess the damages and fix whatever is necessary.\\" =American Dream (2011‚Äì2016)= On April 29, 2011, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority completed a deal with Triple Five Group, the owners of two of North America's largest malls: West Edmonton Mall and the Mall of America, who had previously proposed \\"MeadowFest America\\" for the New Jersey site in 2002, before the contract was awarded to Mills Corporation. Triple Five assumed ownership of the mall and renamed it \\"American Dream Meadowlands\\", announcing a tentative opening date of early 2014, to coincide with Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium. The deal was officially announced on May 3, 2011. Among the changes to the project would an expansion to 3 million square feet, an 8.5-acre indoor glass-domed amusement park, water parks, and an ice skating rink. In July 2012 DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg announced that a DreamWorks Water Park would open at the mall. In June 2012, the Giants and the Jets sought an injunction against Triple Five from resuming construction after it took over the project from the Mills Corporation, stating that the addition of amusement and water parks at the site would adversely affect traffic at MetLife stadium on days when home games were played there, specifically 16 Sundays out of the year, the day of the week that Bergen County's Blue Law prohibits shopping, though not amusement parks. The teams contended that while the mall would be closed on Sundays, the amusement park would not, which would create traffic jams on game days, when between 20,000 and 25,000 vehicles would park at the complex. Traffic studies conducted by the team estimated that 7,700 spots would be added by the project, while developers stated that it would add only 63 more cars, as local residents would be wise enough to avoid the grounds at that time, and most tourists would take the rail link to the MetLife Stadium site rather than drive.Brennan, John (December 7, 2012). \\"Small step forward for American Dream parks\\". NorthJersey.com. Triple Five objected to the law's restriction because it would infringe upon their business. In July 2012 Triple Five countersued for what it called an improper campaign by the teams to preserve their monopoly at the site, while dissuading potential lenders from investing. On March 12, 2014 the parties reached a tentative settlement, agreeing to drop their lawsuits. Though specific details of the agreement were not made public, the agreement allowed the long-delayed project to move forward. Construction had been ongoing since November 2013, and was expected to pick up in early 2014. Although no timetable for completion was announced, the developer originally said it would take about 24 months to complete the project once construction began. That April, Triple Five released a revised design for the mall's exterior and confirmed a tentative opening date in late 2016, though by December 2014, it was reported that this would only be a partial opening. By May 2013, progress on the project was delayed further by financing, permitting, and a lawsuit filed by the New York Giants and New York Jets over traffic concerns.Sherman, Ted (May 17, 2013). \\"Sports Authority approves expanded American Dream proposal\\". NJ.com. Triple Five officially took ownership of the mall on July 31, 2013, with construction set to start in late August of that year, despite the lawsuit. Construction officially began in November and the developer estimated it would take approximately 24 months to complete the project. In April 2014, Triple Five released a revised design for the mall's exterior and confirmed a tentative opening date in late 2016, though by December 2014, it was reported that this would only be a partial opening. In June 2015, the New Jersey Local Finance Board approved a tax- sharing plan between East Rutherford and Triple Five. In August 2015, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority reauthorized a $390 million potential tax break for the project. These steps were intended to set the stage for a sale of up to $1 billion in government bonds to raise money to complete the project in time for its new projected completion in the second half of 2017. In April 2016, a planned bond issue fell through. In July 2016, construction appeared to have stopped, the developers were trying to obtain $1 billion in additional financing, and the projected completion date had slipped again, to 2018. In August 2016, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority announced an $800 million bond issue intended to finance further construction of the mall. American Dream seen from across the Hackensack River in Secaucus, New Jersey in 2009 In September 2016, Triple Five Group announced that the indoor amusement park space would be occupied by Nickelodeon Universe, which will feature two world record-holding roller coasters. The TMNT Shellraiser, a Euro-Fighter, would hold the record for the steepest roller coaster drop at 97 degrees, and is based on a model seen at two other locations in the United States. The second coaster, a Spinning Coaster called The Shredder, consists of four-passenger cars that spin on a vertical axis as it progresses down the coaster's track, and is the world's tallest and longest free spinning coaster, at 1,600 feet. The water park is DreamWorks Water Park, which will feature attractions such as Shrek's Soggy Swamp, Kung Fu Panda Zone and Madagascar Rain Forest. The park's centerpiece will be the world's largest indoor wave pool, measuring 1.5 acres and holding 1.5 million gallons of water, and the world's second-tallest body slide, starting from a height of 142 feet and featuring a 50-foot free fall. The completed American Dream spans 3 million square feet and consists of 55 percent entertainment facilities and 45 percent retail locations. Entertainment venues will include nightclubs, a 26-screen movie theater and 3,000-seat performing arts theater. The mall would house 450 retail shops, and more than 100 dining options, including approximately 20 full-service restaurants, a first-of-its kind kosher food hall, and a 38,000 square foot gourmet food court with 18 vendors and chef demonstrations operated by the youth-driven food and culture website Munchies. The project would also include a parking lot with 33,000 spaces, an on-site bus hub, and a train station. Triple Five projected 40 million people to visit the mall each year, half of whom would be drawn from the 62 million tourists who visit the tri-state area annually. =Construction halts and resumes again (2016‚Äì2019)= On December 22, 2016, work on the project stopped again. Financing from the 2016 bond issue was delayed until 2017. In May of that year, the developers secured $1.67 billion in construction financing from a syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase, and by the following month, work had resumed. In June 2018, the developer indicated that most of the complex was scheduled to open in early 2019, though the water park would open at the end of 2019. In August 2018, a Triple Five executive, Tony Amrlin, specified that the project was 68% complete and would open in April 2019. That November, it was announced that September 2019 would be the water park's opening date. In August 2018, Triple Five revealed that H&M;, Uniqlo, and Zara would open stores at the mall; the three stores would be those companies' largest mall-based flagship locations. On September 25, 2018, the New Jersey Hall of Fame announced that they would be permanently moving to American Dream. On March 12, 2019, Barneys New York announced that it would open a flagship store at the mall, its only one in New Jersey. However, the firm announced in October 2019 that as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, it would close most of its stores, without specifying whether the one at American Dream would be one of the few to remain open. In 2019 Triple 5 dropped Meadowlands from the name American Dream. On March 8, 2019, Governor Phil Murphy indicated that the mall complex would open that June, but on March 25, Triple 5 Group announced that the project would open in August. On May 20, Triple Five announced that the mall's opening date had again been moved to later in the year, and that some retailers would not open until the 2019 holiday season or early 2020. It revealed that tenants would include Tiffany & Co., Watches of Switzerland, Dolce & Gabbana, Moncler and the experimental retailer Fourpost, which operates a store at Triple Five's other mall property, The Mall of America. Triple Five also revealed more of the complex's attractions and common areas, which were planned to feature rotating art installations and attractions. In June 2019, American Dream announced a 10-year partnership with The Coca-Cola Company and its local bottling partner Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages, which would fully-integrate the Coca-Cola brand throughout the property, and would included a branded eatery. On July 3, 2019, officials from Triple Five announced that the opening date of the mall would be October 25. Later that month, Crain's New York Business reported that the Asian-American supermarket chain H Mart would open a store at American Dream, which in addition to that chain's typical selection of Asian and international food items, would feature the chain‚Äôs \\"Market Eatery\\" venue for top national and international food concepts and chefs, as well as New Jersey's first \\"Let Them Talk Bar and Stage\\" that would feature live music, craft cocktails, entertainment and weekly events. The store will staff a combined 70 to 100 full-time and part- time employees. =Completion, opening, and pandemic closure (2019‚Äìpresent)= On September 20, 2019, Triple Five announced that the mall would open in four stages it refers to as \\"chapters\\". In October 2019, the mall's much-criticized colorful exterior was repainted white. Triple Five also announced that the ski slope would be covered in a mural painted by a Canadian artist collective, set to be completed in 2020. Much of the facade facing the Turnpike would be covered in dynamic LED displays. On October 25, 2019, the mall opened its first chapter, an ice-skating rink and a Nickelodeon amusement park. The theme park contains more than 35 rides and attractions, including three roller coasters that broke world records when they opened. The next chapter, the DreamWorks Water Park, was set to open on November 27, 2019. However, on November 21, 2019, the company announced that they were postponing the water park opening until March 19, 2020. The next chapter, the Big Snow American Dream ski slope, opened on December 5, 2019. The final chapter, consisting of the mall's 350 shops and over 100 restaurants, was branded \\"In Grand Style\\", and planned for a March 2020 opening. However, on February 27, 2020, NJ.com reported that the mall's enclave of luxury stores called The Collections would open in September 2020. On February 19, 2020, Sea Life announced it would open its location at American Dream on April 23, 2020. On March 8, the mall closed, which Triple Five Worldwide announced was a temporary measure resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey, thus again delaying the opening of its retail shops and the DreamWorks Water Park. That same day, it was announced that Forever 21 pulled out of American Dream, due to the company filing for bankruptcy. In April 2020, Triple Five announced that the proportion of the retail tenants at the mall would be smaller, as the mall would consist of approximately 70% entertainment and 30% retail. Among the newly announced entertainment venues would be a trampoline park, eight more rides to Nickelodeon Universe, and interactive museums featuring elaborate props and backdrops. Plans were also in the works for several hotels that would connect to the mall via skybridges, with the area zoned for 3,500 hotel rooms. That same month, the mall partnered with Hackensack Meridian Health and Agile Urgent Care to open a drive-through testing site primarily for local police, first responders, and frontline health care workers. On May 5, 2020, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would no longer be a tenant at American Dream, due to the company's decision to liquidate all of its stores as soon as the company reopened. On June 24, GNC announced that it would also no longer operate a store at the mall. Barneys New York had also withdrawn from American Dream, and several other tenants were considering canceling their leases or reducing their space at the mall. Governor Phil Murphy announced on August 26 that amusements could open with restrictions on September 1, prompting Big Snow American Dream to announce it would reopen on that date. On September 3, 2020, Triple Five announced that on October 1, American Dream would reopen its amusement park, water park, ice rink, and mini-golf arcade, each of which would limit patrons to 25% of capacity. The mall would also unveil its first major retail tenants, 17 of which had been given certificates of occupancy and were ready to open. Among these were H&M;, Primark, Zara, and IT'SUGAR, with indications that others would be announced closer to the date of reopening. On September 29, 2020, it was announced that the Sea Life aquarium and the Legoland Discovery Center would open at some point in the Spring of 2021. On September 9, 2020, American Dream and Hackansack Meridian Health announced a ten-year partnership. The partnership includes opening a urgent care center at the complex, helping the complex reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey, and having pop-up events at American Dream about health and wellness. On October 1, 2020, American Dream officially reopened. That same day, NJ.com reported that Coca-Cola Eats, a Coca-Cola themed restaurant, would open later in the month, and that Munchies, a gourmet food court, would open by the end of the year. It was also announced that the luxury stores, anchored by Saks 5th Avenue, would open in March 2021, with hotels to be added in the near future.

Transportation and parking = Public transport = Public transportation to American Dream Meadowland's on-site bus hub and train station is provided by NJ Transit.

However, that line is not being operated daily for American Dream, but solely during events at the stadium. NJ Transit stated that daily rail service could be added \\"once the rail system is resilient enough that doing so won‚Äôt adversely affect NJ Transit commuters.\\" Multi-modal service is provided by NY Waterway, which provides a package service consisting of ferry service from Manhattan to Weehawken Port Imperial in Weehawken, followed by a bus for the remaining 6.5 miles to the mall. Passengers can also take the bus without a ferry connection. = Private transport = Motorists traveling to the location are accommodated with a 33,000-space parking lot. American Dream initially announced plans to charge for daily parking, but plans to charge for parking were cancelled; American Dream will only charge for parking when events are occurring at MetLife Stadium. The parking garage is set to incorporate a smart IT interface developed by Atos, which would place sensors and Bluetooth- enabled beacons to help customers locate empty parking spots near the stores and attractions that want to visit. American Dream will run a fleet of several helicopters to offer luxury transportation for wealthy international tourists and residents from the roof of the mall's Saks Fifth Avenue store. Criticism The mall under construction, with MetLife Stadium under construction as well, as seen from an airplane on April 19, 2008 Opposition to the idea of building a permanent shopping center within the Meadowlands Sports Complex centered on traffic and environmental concerns. The project is being built on state-owned land, as the NJSEA is a state agency, and $81.3 million was spent on transportation improvements such as new off and on ramps and a train station at the Sports Complex. Some have also called the mall a \\"colossal real estate nightmare\\", and \\"perhaps the worst retail failure ever\\". The project was also criticized by environmentalists who issued a complaint on July 10, 2012 that draft permits approved by the Army Corps of Engineers would allow five more acres of wetlands to be destroyed for the project, which had already filled in more than seven. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, stated, \\"This project will increase traffic and flooding while taking business away from existing stores. This project is the Super Bowl of Sprawl and the American Dream is a commuter‚Äôs nightmare.\\" In May 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it was formally investigating the Mills Corporation, the original developer of the property, after it announced that it was restating four years of earnings due to executive misconduct and accounting errors. Later in the year, an analyst at Bank of America Securities pushed Mills Corporation to drop the project, citing the signs of cost overruns. In 2007 the Federal Aviation Administration expressed concerns about the height of the Ferris wheel, which at the time was planned to be , which the FAA feared would affect local air traffic to and from Teterboro Airport. In June 2012, the New York Giants and the New York Jets filed a lawsuit against Triple Five, seeking to halt construction. The lawsuit claimed that the addition of amusement and water parks at the site would adversely affect traffic at MetLife stadium on days when home games were played there, specifically 16 Sundays out of the year, the day of the week that Bergen County's Blue Law prohibits shopping, though not amusement parks. The teams contended that while the mall would be closed on Sundays, the amusement park would not, which would create traffic jams on game days when up to 25,000 vehicles would park at the complex. Traffic studies conducted by the team estimated that 7,700 spots would be added by the project; the developers countered that the amusement parks would add only 63 more cars, claiming that local residents would be wise enough to avoid visiting on a game day, and most tourists would take the rail link rather than drive.Brennan, John (December 7, 2012). \\"Small step forward for American Dream parks\\". NorthJersey.com. In July 2012 Triple Five countersued for what it called an improper campaign by the teams to preserve their monopoly at the site while dissuading potential lenders from investing. On March 12, 2014 the parties reached a tentative settlement, agreeing to drop their lawsuits, which allowed the project to move forward. In February 2015, U.S. federal prosecutors accused Joe Ferriero, former chairman of the Bergen County Democratic Organization and New Jersey political power broker, of bribery, fraud, and racketeering charges.Sampson, Peter (February 27, 2015) \\"Hard work or abuse of power? Joseph Ferriero corruption trial opens with widely varying portrayals\\". NorthJersey.com The charges included an allegation that Mills Corporation paid Ferriero $1.7 million over the course of several years as a bribe or extortion to maintain Ferriero's political support for their development bid on the Xanadu project against rivals Hartz Mountain Industries. James Dausch, a former Mills Corporation employee testified that the $1.7 million was paid for Ferriero's consulting, not as a bribe. Dausch's testimony detailed much of the development bid process, including paid lobbyists positioning Mills with Governor Jim McGreevey, then Governor Richard Codey, as well as with Senator Robert Menendez.Sampson, Peter (March 10, 2015 \\"Developer testifying in Ferriero trial says $1.7M wasn't a bribe\\".

If the coefficients of are integers and the constant c=\\\\frac{p}{q} is a rational number, the coefficients of may be not integers, but the polynomial has integer coefficients and has the same roots as . A special case is when c=\\\\frac{a_1}{na_0}. The resulting polynomial does not have any term in . =Reciprocals of the roots= Let : P(x) = a_0x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_{n} be a polynomial.

In the special case where c=a_0, all coefficients of are multiple of , and \\\\frac{Q}{c} is a monic polynomial, whose coefficients belong to any integral domain containing and the coefficients of . This polynomial transformation is often used to reduce questions on algebraic numbers to questions on algebraic integers. Combining this with a translation of the roots by \\\\frac{a_1}{na_0}, allows to reduce any question on the roots of a polynomial, such as root-finding, to a similar question on a simpler polynomial, which is monic and does not have a term of degree . For examples of this, see Cubic function ¬ß Reduction to a depressed cubic or Quartic function ¬ß Converting to a depressed quartic. Transformation by a rational function All preceding examples are polynomial transformations by a rational function, also called Tschirnhaus transformations. Let :f(x)=\\\\frac{g(x)}{h(x)} be a rational function, where and are coprime polynomials. The polynomial transformation of a polynomial by is the polynomial (defined up to the product by a non-zero constant) whose roots are the images by of the roots of . Such a polynomial transformation may be computed as a resultant. In fact, the roots of the desired polynomial are exactly the complex numbers such that there is a complex number such that one has simultaneously (if the coefficients of and are not real or complex numbers, \\"complex number\\" has to be replaced by \\"element of an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients of the input polynomials\\") :\\\\begin{align} P(x)&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ y\\\\,h(x)-g(x)&=0\\\\,. \\\\end{align} This is exactly the defining property of the resultant :\\\\operatorname{Res}_x(y\\\\,h(x)-g(x),P(x)) This is generally difficult to compute this through a hand-written computation. However, as most computer algebra systems have a built-in function to compute resultants, it is straightforward to compute it with a computer. =Properties= If the polynomial is irreducible, then either the resulting polynomial is irreducible, or it is a power of an irreducible polynomial. Let \\\\alpha be a root of and consider , the field extension generated by \\\\alpha. The former case means that f(\\\\alpha) is a primitive element of , which has as minimal polynomial. In the latter case, f(\\\\alpha) belongs to a subfield of and its minimal polynomial is the irreducible polynomial that has as power. Transformation for equation-solving Polynomial transformations have been applied to the simplification of polynomial equations for solution, where possible, by radicals. Descartes introduced the transformation of a polynomial of degree which eliminates the term of degree by a translation of the roots. Such a polynomial is termed depressed. This already suffices to solve the quadratic by square roots. In the case of the cubic, Tschirnhaus transformations replace the variable by a quadratic function, thereby making it possible to eliminate two terms, and so can be used to eliminate the linear term in a depressed cubic to achieve the solution of the cubic by a combination of square and cube roots. The Bring‚ÄìJerrard transformation, which is quartic in the variable, brings a quintic into \\"principal\\" or Bring-Jerrard normal form with terms of degree 5,1, and 0.

Early life Charles Francis Walsh was born in Mission Valley, California, on October 27, 1877, to Mr. and Mrs. Walter C. Walsh. When he was a young boy, the family moved to nearby San Diego, California. Growing up, he worked in his father's grocery store. Enterprising even at an early age, he started his own bicycle business as a teenager, but this would be the first of several unsuccessful ventures for Walsh until his early thirties. In 1901, at the age of 24, he hitchhiked to Los Angeles and took a job as a stationary engineer at the California General Hospital in Los Angeles. It was there that he met a young nursing student named Alice Connolly. They were married on September 23, 1903. In January 1904, he and his new wife moved to Winslow, Arizona, where he went to work for the Union Pacific Railroad as a freight train engineer. Charles grew impatient during what turned out to be a long and frustrating apprenticeship, so he moved back to Los Angeles to work in an oil refinery as a field engineer. It was not long, however, before they ventured to Goldfield, Nevada, to seek their share of the gold fortune believed to be there. At first, the Walshes were able to make decent money supporting the blossoming mining industry of the town. The couple did return to Los Angeles in the spring of 1905 to give birth to their son Kenneth, while Charles briefly returned to work in the oil fields. They returned to Goldfield a short time later. Alice gave birth to a daughter (Juanita) there the following year. When Goldfield died a quick death in 1907, however, a financially troubled Walsh was forced to move his family into his father's house at 17th and K streets in San Diego. Charles found work as an elevator operator in a local hotel. Walsh became fascinated with aviation from reading about the subject in the local newspapers. Using only pictures from these newspapers, he sketched his own airplane design in between elevator trips at work and was determined to fly it one day. In 1909, Walsh convinced a small group of local investors to open the first airplane manufacturing company in California.Matt, P. R. (n.d.). Charles Francis Walsh (K. C. Rust, Ed.). Historical Aviation Album, IX. Retrieved from NASM Archives Technical Reference Files Walsh, Charles Frances, CW-103000-02 First airplane The San Diego Aeroplane Manufacturing Company incorporated on August 25, 1909, capitalized at $200,000. The company was located in room 432 of the Keating Building on the corner of Fifth and F Streets in downtown San Diego. Walsh was vice president and general manager. He built his airplane in the old Rogers carriage shop on Third Street (between E and F Streets) near the company headquarters. This location is now a parking garage for the Westfield Horton Plaza. By late November, Walsh had essentially completed his airplane. Built from seasoned spruce and piano wire it measured 40 feet long with a 50-foot wingspan. It was reported to be the largest monoplane in the world at the time. Like the Wright Brothers design, a motor drove twin pusher propellers through a bicycle chain. The propellers were seven feet long and made of Oregon pine with hickory hubs. Like Curtiss, he used a tricycle type landing gear and ailerons vice the Wright's wing warping method for lateral control of his Bleriot-type monoplane. His wings tapered from curved in the middle to flat ends. The reason given for this is that the newspaper picture he used as his template for the design had the ends of the wings cutoff, so that is how he thought they looked. Attached to these was his specially designed device to automatically provide lateral stability to his airplane. This consisted of a fifteen-pound weight suspended from a five-foot rod which was connected to both wingtips. As air flow acted on the wings, the weight would act as to raise on wingtip and lower the other, maintaining lateral stability without pilot input. For control, Walsh designed a dual lever system, closely resembling that of the Wright Brothers. One controlled the engine and one controlled the pitch. It was powered by a 30 H. P. Cameron automobile engine. Walsh tested his airplane at the Coronado Island Country Club racetrack during the last week of December. He was one of three local San Diego aviators, including Waldo Waterman, attempting to enter an airplane in the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field. The airplane was damaged during ground runs at Coronado on December 29. His wife Alice sold her jewelry so that he could attend the event as a spectator. While there, he made the most of the opportunity to learn about airplane design from the most legendary pioneers in aviation. When it was decided that San Diego would host its own air meet immediately following the one in Los Angeles, Walsh hurried home to incorporate what he learned into his own design as he rebuilt his airplane ahead of the event.Morehouse, H. E. (n.d.). Unpublished manuscript, Harold E. Morehouse Flying Pioneers Biographies collection, National Air and Space Museum Archives He shortened his wingspan by approximately five feet, shortened the front elevator support assembly by ten feet, and added a \\"horizontal plane\\" over the rear rudder. He also removed one of his rear rudders and abandoned his problematic chain-drive, dual-propeller configuration for a single-propeller, direct-drive system. Walsh ordered a new six-foot propeller and intended to purchase one from Charles K. Hamilton upon his arrival at Coronado for the 1910 San Diego Aviation Meet. All of this yielded a 100-pound savings in weight and better controllability. His Cameron engine was raised two feet above the lower level of the main frame and produced 2000 rpm. =1910 San Diego Aviation Meet= During the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field, Charles K. Hamilton was invited by some San Diego businessmen to come to Coronado Island and attempt to beat the altitude record that Louis Paulhan set during that meet. For the people of San Diego, the event was about attracting aviation to San Diego and raising money for the Panama-California Exposition the city planned to host in 1915. Glenn Curtiss was in search of a suitable location for a winter headquarters and asked Hamilton to scout out San Diego for him. He loaned Hamilton his Curtiss No. 2 \\"Reims Racer\\" for this purpose. The 1910 San Diego Aviation Meet was scheduled for January 23‚Äì25. Charles F. Walsh was guaranteed the first $500 in profits to demonstrate his airplane on the opening day of the meet.Jackrabbits to jets: the history of Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego, California Elretta Sudsbury - San Diego Pub. Co. - 1992 Walsh destroyed his airplane during his demonstration on the opening day of the meet when he was forced to taxi his airplane into a fence to avoid hitting Hamilton and the Reims Racer. Two days later, Hamilton took Walsh along for a flight as a passenger in the Reims Racer. This was the first flight for Walsh. Amateur aviation career =Imperial Beach, California= Following the San Diego Aviation Meet, Walsh built a new airplane in less than 30 days. He was invited by a San Diego developer named E W Peterson to move his airplane to nearby Imperial Beach, California. Peterson had three 30-foot-wide by 600-foot-long runways graded for this purpose. Around April 1, 1910, Walsh began developing an aviation camp there while testing his new airplane. The plane was a nearly exact copy of the Reims Racer in which he had flown as a passenger with Charles K. Hamilton. Walsh added features of his own design that he hoped would simplify controllability, however. Instead of a shoulder yoke for lateral control, Walsh mounted the steering wheel to a post on a double hinge, allowing for dual-axis control to operate the ailerons in addition to the elevators via a wire connection to the ailerons from the base of the control yoke. The engine-shutoff and starting wheel brake were controlled by a single lever fastened directly over the left side of the foot rest. The same motion of the foot-operated both devices. The engine speed lever was still connected to the frame next to the pilot. A day or two later, Walsh added a thrust bearing to his engine, yielding an additional 25% increase in speed. On April 10, 1910, approximately 100 onlookers witnessed his first flight. Reaching an altitude of 15‚Äì20 feet, he flew for approximately 400 feet over the Imperial Beach runway before executing a reportedly flawless landing. By late May, he had already turned down offers to perform during the Fourth of July celebration of Baker City, Oregon; St. Louis, Missouri; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The personal expense to him for such long distance trips made him concentrate on opportunities closer to San Diego. He also made significant improvements to his airplane by this time, adding steel-rimmed wheels for his landing gear and installing a more advanced propeller. To compensate for the aft center of gravity resulting from the increased weight of his engine relative to the one that powered the Reims Racer that he faithfully modeled his airplane after, he modified his tail to a box design, vice the single elevator. On June 2, Walsh suffered a major setback when his airplane crashed following a steep turn during a practice run on the aviation course. It was quickly determined that his engine could not provide sufficient thrust to maintain altitude at steep angles of bank. While this accident almost convinced Walsh to abandon aviation altogether, fellow Imperial Beach aviator B F Roehrig began an effort to raise money for a better engine. He had made over 40 flights at this point. Most were straight and level below 50 ft covering distances of 100 to 1000 feet as he gained confidence in himself and his airplane. On the Fourth of July, he performed three aerial demonstrations at Imperial Beach before a crowd of 300‚Äì400 curious onlookers. Later that month, Walsh acquired a more powerful 40 hp Elbridge engine, which he rented from another San Diego aviation hopeful. The more powerful engine quickly gave him the confidence to take his aviation to a larger venue. =Los Angeles= By early September, 1910, Walsh was established at the Los Angeles Motordrome, where the Aero Club of California had established an aviation camp. Powered by his three-cylinder Elbridge featherweight, Walsh dominated a small field of fellow amateur Southern California aviators in the novice air meet held at the motordrome from 22‚Äì23 October, winning every event. Prizes included cash and trophies, including the San Diego Cup for highest altitude. The event also earned him notoriety. Soon afterward, Walsh became aligned with Macomber Aeroplane Engine Company, a local rotary engine manufacturer in Los Angeles, and replaced his Elbridge Featherweight with the first Macomber rotary engine ever built. The engine did not perform well and prevented Walsh from participating in the second Los Angeles Air Meet at Dominguez Field in late December 1910. On February 19, 1911, Walsh took his entire family flying, powered by an improved Macomber engine. Charlie, Alice, Kenneth, and Juanita became the first family to every fly together in an airplane. On March 4, 1911, Harry Harkness contracted Walsh to build an airplane for use by his chief mechanic John Kiley to learn to fly at the Harkness camp at North Island in San Diego, California. =Harkness and Walsh Silver Darts= Walsh delivered the plane to John Kiley at the Harkness aviation camp at North Island on April 7, 1911. According to at least one source, Walsh added \\"silver dust\\" to the unbleached muslin of the flying surfaces. This earned the aircraft the name \\"Silver Dart\\". Harkness paid Walsh $5000 for the plane, finally making him solvent. A week later, Walsh crashed his plane at Dominguez Field while attempting to qualify as the Aero Club of California's first licensed aviator. At some point, Walsh built a Silver Dart of his own. There seems to be disagreement as the whether the Walsh Silver Dart was built before or after his crash at Dominguez. Like the Silver Dart he sold to Harry Harkness, his was based on the Curtiss airplane of the day, but with four Farman-type ailerons mounted flush to the end of all four wings replacing the Curtiss-style ailerons normally located between the upper and lower wing. The upper and lower ailerons were connected to each other via a vertical pole and operated in unison. They were moved via wires connected to the pilots steering wheel post. The wings also had about 1/3 more surface area than a Curtiss, spanning 40 feet with a 4.5 foot chord. It measured 37 feet from the tip of the forward elevator to the tail of the rudder. Both the rudder and front elevator were double surfaced, or box-type, with the rudder being enclosed by a pair of two foot square vertical wings on either side of the horizontal surface. There was no elevator function to the tail. The tail and elevator surfaces measured approximately two feet by six feet and were set much farther out from the wings than a normal Curtiss. Unlike the Harkness airplane, however, this Silver Dart was powered by the first production 40 hp, four- cylinder Hall-Scott engine which turned an eight-foot propeller. Exhibition aviator =Pacific Aviation Company= Walsh began his career as a professional exhibition aviator with the Pacific Aviation Company, owned by the Manning Brothers of Portland, Oregon. His first event was May 11‚Äì12, 1911 in Roseburg, Oregon. He kept a very busy schedule throughout the Pacific Northwest and endured some close calls and crashes. At his event at Laramie, Wyoming, on July 31, he set a record for the highest elevation at which airplane flight was ever successfully conducted in the United States (7200 feet). While Alice Walsh would later recall that Charles had his Silver Dart stolen at Kearney, Nebraska, about a week later by the Manning Brothers, this account is disputed by local newspapers. His airplane was reportedly almost completely destroyed when he hit a tree during his exhibition there on August 4. Following that, on August 12, Charles Walsh landed in a cornfield while performing an exhibition at Fremont, Nebraska. The locals were very upset by what they considered a poor showing by Walsh. The farmer who owned the field sued the Pacific Aviation Company a few days later for $100 in damages to his crops and a local judge confiscated the airplane pending a settlement. This was perhaps the first such lawsuit of its kind. On August 24, the Pacific Aviation Company settled a suit brought by the local aviation committee of Fremont for $300. Walsh then sued the Pacific Aviation Company for $56.25 that he felt was owed to him as his share of ticket sales for the event. This resulted in an attachment (law) being executed against the airplane. Walsh and Manning then had an altercation in front of the Terry Hotel in Fremont that night over Manning deducting airplane repair costs from his share of ticket sales. This was something Walsh claimed clearly violated his contract. According to the local newspaper covering the event, Walsh did not own any interest in the plane. =Curtiss Exhibition Company= Following the 1911 Chicago International Aviation Meet, Walsh became a contract demonstration pilot with the Curtiss Exhibition Company. On August 31, 1911, he reportedly flew his newly assigned 75 hp Curtiss pusher for the first time at Sterling, Illinois, without incident, followed by an event in Iowa.Proves That Man Can At Last Fly Sterling Gazette, 31 Aug. 1911, pp. 1‚Äì5. Walsh then returned to Nebraska, performing aerial demonstrations until the first week of October. On October 12, crowds gathered at Traction Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to watch Walsh become the first pilot to fly over the Rio Grande Valley. The Albuquerque International Sunport has a 1914 Curtiss-style pusher representative of the one flown by Walsh on display in the terminal which helps commemorate the event. He continued on a very busy schedule for the rest of the year. For Walsh, 1912 began by making flights over Havana, Cuba, on New Years Day. His demonstration flights in that city included flying the first woman passenger in Cuba. He spent the rest of January on a very busy tour throughout Texas. His flying soon became influenced by Lincoln Beachy. He crashed and died on October 3, 1912, in Trenton, New Jersey, and was buried in Calvary Cemetery, San Diego.

The community is part of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Star was founded in July 1900 as a train stop when the Gulf and Ship Island RR (later becoming the Illinois Central and now the Canadian National RR) passed through. It had a bank, hotel, car dealership, numerous stores, and a school. Its prosperity suffered as people began to leave the rural areas to move to the city. The school was scheduled to open for the 1921‚Äì22 school year but did not open until after Christmas that year. Up until that time the elementary students attended school at Wesleyanna Methodist Church and the high school age students went to Star Baptist Church. Star fielded several sports teams including basketball, baseball, and football. Although only having a football team for the 1937 through the 1941 seasons (a team was not fielded in the 1942 season due to the outbreak of World War II) Star gained some measure of success, defeating Mendenhall and Magee during that period. They also beat rival Florence four out of the five times they played. The 1937 team won the Middle Mississippi Class B Championship with a victory over Camden at Millsaps.

He became the first licensed big game guide in Alaska. Early life and emigration Andrew Berg was born Anders Berg on October 16, 1869, in Nykarleby, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. His father Johan and mother Lovisa owned a small farm. The family also hunted and fished. Because of extreme poverty, Andrew left Finland in 1887 at the age of 16. Along with two other boys from his town, Berg sailed to Hull in England, before travelling to Liverpool by train. He was one of 500 emigrants that were to sail to New York City aboard the St. Andreas. Because of a cholera outbreak, the ship instead sailed to Quebec. The boys travelled to Chicago, then to Michigan City, Indiana, where they obtained work at a sawmill.Cassidy, pg. 2 After working at the mill for a short time, Berg travelled to his uncle Erik's home in San Francisco. Berg travelled to the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, likely with his uncle, and took a job at a salmon cannery. Living in the village of Kenai, Berg spent his winters trapping and fished for the Alaska Packers' Association during the summer.Cassidy, pg. 5 Hunting and guiding In addition to fishing and trapping, Berg became involved in hunting and exploring in the Kenai Peninsula. During the late 19th century, large moose antlers made their way to the Lower 48 and trophy hunting became a popular business on the Peninsula. A picture of a set of antlers measuring taken by Berg and acquired by a dealer in Tacoma, Washington, was published in Field and Stream in March 1897.Cassidy, pg. 9 After seeing the picture and desiring to discover who had collected the antlers, Dall DeWeese, a wealthy entrepreneur from Colorado with an interest in hunting and wildlife, became the first known person to travel to the Peninsula to hunt. In September 1897, DeWeese found Berg at the cannery where he worked and arranged his release to serve as a guide. On their trip, DeWeese killed eight Dall sheep, two bears, and three moose with antler spreads ranging from 58 to 69 inches. DeWeese published articles about his expedition in at least three journals.Cassidy, pg. 11 DeWeese returned in 1898, 1899, and 1901, noticing decreased populations of wildlife as a result of the new interest and lack of hunting regulations in the region. He wrote a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, asking for regulations and conservation in Alaska. Following surveys of the region, regulations were established in 1908 that required game wardens, bag limits, and licensed guides. Berg was issued license \\"No. 1\\", which he held for over twenty years. He later served as a warden from 1920 to 1921, and worked for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service from 1924 until 1936. Later life and death Berg retired from guiding in 1929, as the Great Depression led to fewer hunting trips and decreased fur prices. In February 1939, Berg was found ill in bed at one of his cabins. He was flown to a hospital in Anchorage where he died on March 1, 1939, after suffering from heart and kidney problems for ten years. Cabins Berg built a total of 11 log cabins on the Kenai Peninsula. He built his first, which served as his home, in 1902 on Tustumena Lake. Berg used spruce logs to construct the home cabin, which measures 17 feet wide by 17 feet long. The cabin is located within what is now the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as Andrew Berg Cabin. With Also in the Refuge is Berg's last cabin, built in 1935, also on Tustumena Lake. In 2000 the cabin was disassembled and moved next to the Refuge's visitor center. The 1935 cabin is open to the public.
