With his wide interests, he engages in a wide scope of creativity, touching upon aspects of current affairs, historical, biographical, humorous life and children‚Äôs educational caricatures. Ma Sing Yuen was born in Hong Kong and lives in Hong Kong; his ancestral home is Dongguan, Guangdong. His given name is Yuen Chau Chiu and Malone is his other pen name. He used to work as arts director and art editor for newspapers and magazines and has fully dedicated himself to caricature creations since the 1980s, by publishing his works in several major newspapers of Hong Kong, covering topics such as current affairs, politics and humour. He founded the White Cat Black Cat series with Fong She-mei in 2004. Nowadays, White Cat Black Cat series are well-received by children and parents in Hong Kong. This series is remarkable and has gained many book awards in Hong Kong. Q boy is the main character of White Cat Black Cat series. He is one of the 24 classic local comic characters selected by Create Hong Kong in 2012.The three-dimensional sculpture of Q boy has displayed at Kowloon Park in Tsim Sha Tsui and Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai. In 2015, Ma held his first Chinese brush paintings exhibition at the City Hall High Block, featuring a collection of black-and-white paintings of landscape and portraits in freehand brushwork.He has demonstrated a bold and flowing style with unconventional composition, subtly displaying a touch of Zen. In 2017, Ma's second Ink Painting Exhibition was held at Fo Guang Yuan Changhua Art Gallery (Hong Kong). The ideas of the exhibits in ‚ÄòEveryday Chan Implications: Ma Sing Yuen‚Äôs Ink Painting Exhibition' are drawn from the vast ocean of Chan stories. The artist has translated the wisdom and farsightedness of these stories into a humorous style of Chinese ink painting. It is taking things in a lighthearted way to understand the meaning of life, a way to experience the daily life of sages. In 2018, Ma held his third Chinese Poetry and Ink Painting Exhibition ‚ÄòGlimpse of the Bygone: Ma Sing Yuen's Chinese Poetry and Ink Painting Exhibition‚Äô at the Tsimshatsui Book Centre of the Commercial Press in Hong Kong. He recreated Tang Poetry, Song Ci and Zen thoughts into delicate ink paintings, drawing inspirations from Fun with Classical Chinese jointly produced with Fong She-mei. He was also invited abroad to have a solo exhibition in September at the Nan Tien Temple Fo Guang Yuan Art Gallery in Sydney.

History In the summer of 2012, Ross Bailey and a friend decided to create a brand called Rock and Rule to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. They opened a pop up shop on Marshall Street, Soho to launch it. What surprised Bailey was the number of people asking him how he got hold of the shop. It was at this point he realised there was an opportunity to make it easier for people to find and rent short-term retail space. When Rock and Rule closed, Bailey took his share of the profit and put it into launching Appear Here. Currently, Appear Here lists over 10,000 short-term spaces worldwide, with prime retail properties in global cities including, London, Manchester, New York City and Paris. Over 200,000 brands have signed up to the platform, including Apple, Supreme, Nike, Netflix, Chanel and Tommy Hilfiger. =Expansion= In November 2013, Appear Here closed a ¬£1 million funding round, securing backing from Howzat Partners (backers of Trivago), MMC Ventures (backers of AlexandAlexa) and Forward Investment Partners (existing investors and backers of uSwitch and Hailo).

After failing to break into West Brom's first team, he returned to non-League football with Birmingham League club Stafford Rangers before signing as an outside right for Second Division club Hull City in 1925. =Hull City= He made his first appearance in the Football League against South Shields on 10 October, and in his second game, two days later against Nottingham Forest, scored his first goal as well as setting up another for William Cowan in a 5‚Äì0 win. The Hull Daily Mail's pseudonymous \\"Veritas\\" thought he \\"appear[ed] to be as promising as anyone. Though not exactly a flier, he is not easily put out of step, and capable of giving as much as he received; he also knows when to cross a ball to the benefit of those in the centre\\". He was also tried at inside right, to accommodate George Richardson on the wing, but was to find himself playing as often for the reserves as for the first team. By the 1926‚Äì27 FA Cup draw with Everton, \\"Veritas\\" was suggesting that Horne had \\"clearly showed ... that his time is not yet\\", and outside-left George Martin (a future league-winner with Everton) would be better employed in his place. It was Horne's 26th and last appearance for Hull's first team, though he did help the reserves win the Midland Combination title. =Southend United and Manchester City= Horne left Hull City for Third Division South club Southend United ahead of the 1927‚Äì28 Football League season. He played the first 32 matches of the season, scoring 10 goals, and and then joined Second Division promotion-chasers Manchester City as one of five forwards signed in the two weeks before the 17 March transfer deadline. Horne played in 7 of the remaining 12 matches, scoring twice, as City achieved promotion as Second Division champions. He appeared just four times in the First Division, and and returned to the Second Division with Preston North End in September 1929 for a ¬£2,000 fee. =Preston North End= At the start of the season, Preston were uncertain as to their best forward line; Horne began at inside right, from which position he scored twice against Bradford City to secure an unlikely draw, switched to inside left and back again, and only in November did they field a settled side, with Horne at outside right, and won four games out of five. As at Manchester City, Horne became an infrequent selection, finishing a three-year spell with 40 League appearances. He was transfer-listed in 1932, and signed for Lincoln City, newly promoted to the Second Division. =Lincoln City= Horne was injured early in the 6‚Äì3 win against Grimsby Town in October 1932, \\"completed the game in a very dazed condition, and his first question on reaching the dressing room at the end of the match was 'Have we won?'\\" His \\"return to form\\" in the next game contributed to a 6‚Äì0 defeat of West Ham United. Left out for a month after Phil Cartwright's return to fitness, he came back into the first team when Cartwright again sustained an injury, and played regularly for his remaining four years with the club. He finished the season with seven goals, including the opener in a 2‚Äì1 win against former club Preston, from 34 matches as Lincoln avoided relegation by three points. Select tables for other seasons via dropdown menu. Lincoln had lost top scorer Allan Hall to Tottenham Hotspur in the summer, and early in the new season, the forward line was regularly shuffled in the hope of finding a goalscoring combination. Horne played at outside right and in both inside-forward positions, and was responsible for taking penalties. He was tried at right half for the reserves with the intention of filling the first-team gap left when Bill Dodgin was moved to centre half, but injuries elsewhere meant he continued in the forward line. Lincoln's relegation was confirmed with three matches still to play, and Horne, who had finished the season at right half, began the 1934‚Äì35 Third Division North season as established first-choice in that position. The team was much more settled in general, and Lincoln finished in fourth place; Horne and left-half George Whyte were both ever-present in 42 League and 5 FA Cup matches. He returned to the forward line during the latter part of the season. Against Accrington Stanley in March 1935, he took a ball in the face followed by a tackle which left his face bloodied, but he returned after 13 minutes' treatment and set up the only goal of the game for Tommy Robinson; two weeks later, the Daily Express dubbed him \\"the star of Lincoln attack\\" for creating two first-half goals for Robinson against Stockport County. When he resumed his right-half duties, the Lincolnshire Echo wrote that \\"on the team captain's recent displays one can well imagine that the management wish they could play him in two or three positions at once, but he can be relied upon to continue a dominating figure at right half.\\" Having missed a penalty for the first time in a League match for Lincoln, albeit in a 6‚Äì0 win, in April, he atoned at the start of the 1935‚Äì36 season with a hat-trick of penalties to beat Stockport County 3‚Äì0. He missed a month with ankle ligament damage, but came back to score 14 goals, of which 7 were from the penalty spot, and to enjoy what the Echo's review called =Later career= He played regularly until the end of December 1936, and then joined fellow Northern Section team Mansfield Town, where he linked up again with former Lincoln manager Harry Parkes. He remained with the club as player and captain for 18 months, making 44 League appearances, and then took up the role of assistant trainer, working under manager Jack Poole.

The ancient Turkmen proverb says: \\"Kayi and Bayat tribes shall lead the people\\" (Turkmen: \\"Il ba≈üy - ga√Ωy- ba√Ωat\\").  Etymology and origin  Initially, the ethnonym Bayat was mentioned as an Oguz tribe in the 11th century by the Turkic historian Mahmud Kashgari.Divan√º L√ªgat-it-T√ºrk ve Terc√ºmesi (in Turkish), translated by. B. Atalay. Ankara: T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1985. Vol. I. p. 56; Vol. III. p.171 Bayat - an Oghuz Turkic tribe, who stood together with the Kayi tribe at the head of all 24 Oguz tribes - \\"Il bashi Kayi-Bayat.\\" In the traditions of the Turkic tribes, the origin of this tribe is traced to Bayat - the grandson of Oghuz-Khan. In the book of the Khan and historian of the Khiva Khanate, Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur, ‚ÄúGenealogy of the Turkmens,‚Äù the meaning of the name of the tribe is given as ‚Äúrich‚Äù. Bayat was the second son of Gun-Khan, who was the first son of Oguz-Khan. According to the work of the historian, Rashid-al-Din Fazl-Allah, ‚ÄúOghuz-nameh‚Äù, which is part of his extensive historical work Jami' al-tawarikh (Collection of Chronicles), the name Bayat means ‚Äúrich, full of grace‚Äù. On the territory of Kievan Rus, Bayats are recorded as part of the Oghuz tribes in chronicles of the X-XII centuries by the name of bouts. Clans Bayat is the name of an originally Turkic clan in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran which traces its origin to the 12th century. When Bayat clan started to migrate from the Aral steppes, their first destination was the city of Nishapur in the south of Khorasan, a state in the north-east of Iran. The Bayat clan moved in the 13th century to three different locations after attacks by Mongol forces. The Bayat clan made war with the Mongols, killing Genghis Khan's son-in-law with his army. Then Khan attacked Nishapur with all his forces, killing many Bayat clansmen, and the rest of the Bayat clan escaped to the mountains around Nishapur. From there, one group went east and north-east, so that the surname Bayat is still found in Afghanistan. They moved further south and settled in the Gujarat Province, India. Bayat families are found in Surat, India and surrounding areas including Vorwad, Navsari, India. During the British Raj of India, many prominent businessmen and Islamic Scholars left India and took the opportunity to settle in the Natal and Transvaal Provinces of South Africa. A second group went south-west towards Isfahan, and the surname Bayat is prominent in Arak, Hamedan, Malayer, Isfahan, Zanjan and Shiraz. The third group went north-west, and in Azerbaijan they divided in two; one part of the group took the west to Anatolia, and second part went south into Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.  Bayat in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan  Until 1928, the Gyzyletrek settlement of the Balkan velayat of Turkmenistan was called Bayathaji, while Bayat Turkmens still live in Darganata, Danew, Turkmenabat, Sayat, Farap and Hojambaz etraps (districts) of the Lebap velayat of Turkmenistan. Representatives of the Bayat tribe may also be found in many districts of Bukhara province of Uzbekistan, especially in Olat and Qarako'l. Places with name Bayat Bayats are spread far into western Anatolia, their principal areas of settlement being in the provinces of Konya, Bursa, Afyon, Balƒ±kesir and K√ºtahya. Today the name in forms such as Bayat, Bayatlar, Bayatlƒ± is found in thirty-two mainly western Anatolian toponyms. The name also appears in toponyms in Iran, two near ArƒÅk, one near Zanjan, one near Urmia, one in Khuzestan, one near Bor≈´jerd, and one in Khorasan. In post-Soviet countries, five places in Azerbaijan, four in Turkmenistan, and one in Uzbekistan close to the Turkmenistan border bear the names Bayat. In Gujarat, India, one place can be found about 250 km away from the India-Pakistan border. =List of places bearing the name Bayat= Azerbaijan * Boyat, Aghjabadi * Boyat, Neftchala * Boyat, Shamakhi * Boyat, Ujar India * Bayat, Gujarat Province Iran * Bayat, East Azerbaijan * Bayat-e Sofla, East Azerbaijan * Bayat, Razavi Khorasan * Bayat, West Azerbaijan * Bayat Rural District, Markazi * Qezel Tappeh-ye Bayat, Zanjan Province Turkey * Bayat, Afyonkarahisar Province * Bayat, √áorum Province * :tr:Bayat, Amasya, Amasya Province * :tr:Bayat, Merzifon, Amasya Province * :tr:Bayat, Aya≈ü, Ankara Province * :tr:Bayat, Korkuteli, Antalya Province * :tr:Bayat, Altƒ±eyl√ºl, Balikesir Province * :tr:Bayat, G√∂lpazarƒ±, Bilecik Province * :tr:Bayat, Kargƒ±, √áorum Province * :tr:Bayat, √áivril, Denizli Province * :tr:Bayat, √áermik, Diyarbakir Province * Bayat, Atabey, Isparta Province * :tr:Bayat, Tosya, Kastamonu Province * Bayat, Bey≈üehir, Konya Province * Bayat, Meram, Konya Province * Bayat, Aslanapa, K√ºtahya Province * :tr:Bayat, K√ºtahya, K√ºtahya Province * :tr:Bayat, G√∂rdes, Manisa Province * :tr:Bayat, Soma, Manisa Province * Bayat, Bor, Nigde Province * :tr:Bayat, Geyve, Sakarya Province * :tr:Bayat, Duraƒüan, Sinop Province * Bayat, Sivas, Sivas Province * :tr:Bayat, Yƒ±ldƒ±zeli, Sivas Province * :tr:Bayat, Ereƒüli, Zonguldak Province Notable figures from this clan include * Dede Korkut, legendary figure of the Oghuz * Fuz√ªl√Æ, Azerbaijani Diwan poet of Ottoman era * Yusuf Ali Shah, b.

By 1910, the club moved to a new site near the Victoria Saw Mills on Witton Street. Over the next ten years, the club leased the land for ¬£15 per year, and in July 1920, the club purchased the land outright for ¬£750, and was renamed as the Central Ground. In the 1960s, a small grandstand was constructed at the southern perimeter of the ground. The northern perimeter included a terrace area that ran the length of the pitch. The goal ends featured grass embankments with hooped metal railings. Witton Albion sold the Central Ground to J Sainsbury PLC in 1989, and the football club moved to Wincham Park, a new ground in nearby Wincham later that year. The final match at the Central Ground was a 1‚Äì1 draw against Frickley Athletic on 1 May 1989. A new Sainsbury's store was erected on the site along with a new link road, Venables Road.

Biography Benjamin Rubio was born in Bustarga, in Ancares (Leon) on October 12, 1925. During the Spanish Civil War he saw the repression of the Nationalists and it scarred his life forever. At the age of 16 he began working in the mining industry, with an anarcho- syndicalist influence, and served as liaison between the army of the \\"Maquis\\" and the L√©on-Galicia Guerrilla Group, led by C√©sar R√≠os, between 1942 and 1949. During these years, he suffered persecution and finally was imprisoned. After leaving prison, he moved to the Leonesa Region of Laciana, to return to work in the mines. Leaving behind its anarcho-syndicalist influences, the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) contacted him for the reorganization of its structure in the Spanish interior. Thus, he became the underground communist leader for Le√≥n and Galicia. His participation in the Mining Strike of 1962 (called \\"The Huelgona\\"), sets an important historic precedent, to settle one of the first permanent Workers' Commissions. Since the late 1950s, the trade- union policy of the PCE has marked the over-involvement of the Vertical unions. Various Asturian miners' strikes (1958, 1959, ...), had formed the Workers Commission, which dissolved by the end of the conflict. The difference from the Laciana case is that, during that strike, the workers managed to introduce 12 representatives into the Company Board controlled by the Ponferrada Mining, Iron and Steel Company and close to Francoist Spain. One of those representatives was Benjamin Rubio, settling a Permanent Work Commission, and whose extension will be the birth of the Workers Commission Union (CCOO), of which he became an important leader. In the early years of the 1970s, as part of the Anthracite Strike, and with CCOO outlawed and persecuted, Benjamin Rubio was called on to travel to the UK to seek support for the Workers' Commissions from the European trade unions, support which he obtained. For several years he continued his work as leader of the Spanish Communist Party and the Workers' Commissions, participating in the Spanish Transition. Finally, he left the front line of politics, beginning a collaboration with the War and Exile Association (AGE) in the struggle for the recovery of historical memory and recognition of the rebels as soldiers and not as bandits. Between these activities, in 2000 he collaborated with the Caravan of Memory, which brought together several guerrillas from Galicia and Leon in Villablino, initiating a struggle for the memoirs. Some months before dying, he published his book \\"Memoirs of the Anti-Franco Struggle\\", where important biographical and historical aspects are collected, such as the lyrics of Guerrilla anthems and other information. He also participated in the Documentary \\"La Guerrilla de la Memoria\\" (The Guerrilla of Memory). He died on August 25, 2007.

As of 2014, she is the Met's senior officer responsible for mental health and for domestic violence; she also the leads the Association of Chief Police Officers' (ACPO) National Mental Health Working Group. Career In 2008, Jones was in charge of an operation in which Mark Saunders was shot dead by police firearms officers after repeatedly firing a shotgun out of a window; after the inquest into Saunders' death, Jones said \\"the object of the police was to protect the public and bring Mark Saunders to safety. But we are prepared to take appropriate action to make difficult decisions to protect the public\\". In April 2011, Jones was responsible for the security operation at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Jones was appointed to lead the Met on mental health in 2012 upon the retirement of her predecessor. In this role, she has worked to change the way people with mental health problems are treated when they come into contact with the police. Shortly after her appointment, Jones undertook a review of cases involving mental health including deaths in police custody. She concluded that police officers were too often being used for tasks of which they were not trained, such as transporting people detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 to hospital or detention of people in crisis at police stations‚Äîa practice she wishes to see become a \\"never event\\". Jones oversaw the implementation of an assessment framework for the Met in 2013 which was intended to assist police officers in recognising mental health issues, which showed that a third of individuals who come to police attention have mental health problems. During Jones' tenure, mental health professionals have been stationed at police custody suites in London, and the Met aims to extend the scheme to all of its custody suites by the end of 2014. Jones has also overseen the retraining of police officers to recognise a mental health crisis as a medical emergency, with the result that the number of mentally ill people taken to police custody (rather than another \\"place of safety\\") decreased from 86 in 2013 to 27 in the first half of 2014. Jones praised the assistance she received from NHS England in implementing the changes, but was critical of the lack of mental health provision elsewhere in the United Kingdom, describing it as \\"wholly inadequate and [...] until recently, nonexistent in some areas\\". In an interview for The Guardian newspaper, Jones expressed disinterest in becoming commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, stating that she \\"wouldn't want that sort of personal intrusion. Everything you do is under the spotlight\\". Personal life Jones' sister is a consultant psychiatrist and both her parents worked for the National Health Service (NHS).

The agency works to promote particular artistic and cultural-valuable development in activities related to the performing arts, music, literature, art magazines, public libraries and the fine arts; as well as museums and exhibitions, regional cultural activities and national minorities' culture. History The Swedish Arts Council (p.k.a. The Swedish National Council for Cultural Affairs) was established in 1974, in conjunction with the cultural policy decision of that year, as a public authority with the mission of bringing to fruition the cultural policies adopted by the Riksdag and the government. Since then, the cultural policies of Sweden have been revised by the Riksdag a number of times. In 1996, the special significance of literature was highlighted through the adoption of a separate piece of legislation, the Library Act. In 2009 a decision to amend the principles for disbursement of state subsidies were adopted. Thus, since 2011, the regions disburse a bigger proportion of the state subsidies. Organisation The agency has about 80 people working at their office, located at Filmhuset in Stockholm, and is led by a board of directors appointed by the government. The Board has full operational responsibility, and consists of nine members. The Director-General is the chief operating officer, answering to the board of directors. The Board decides on, inter alia, the budget and some government grants.

According to an old tradition, a battle against an unnamed enemy was once fought on the site of the church. The oldest parts of the church dates from the early Middle Ages, i.e. the 12th or 13th century. The church was enlarged during the 14th century, and during the 15th century the wooden ceiling was replaced with brick vaults. The church was further enlarged during the 18th century, and received larger windows. A renovation was carried out in 1957-59. Among the furnishings, the altarpiece (15th century) merits special attention. It was originally made for Stockholm Cathedral but sold to Bogl√∂sa Church already in 1470.

The traditional owners of the area are the Barngalla, Nauo and Battara peoples who inhabited the Eyre peninsula for thousands of years and often camped at the permanent Mikkira waterhole while travelling along the coastline. Settled in 1842, Mikkira was one of the first properties settled on the lower Eyre Peninsula. The station was placed on the market in 1863, it had some improvements and was stocked with 9,700 sheep.

The property was owned by William James Browne from before 1870 to at least 1881, the property was being managed by Alexander Tolmer from 1864 to 1887. In 1884 Mikkira was put up for auction when it was stocked with about 6,000 sheep. John William Henderson acquired Mikkira in 1911 and held it until his death in 1914.

Where Carbon is Taxed The tax was also applied at 0.9 cents per litre of diesel fuel; 0.96 cents per litre of light heating oil; 1 cent per litre of heavy heating oil; 1.3 cents per litre of coke used in making steel; 0.5 cents per litre of propane; and $8 per metric tonne of coal.

Career =Early years= From Birmingham, \\"Gentleman\\" Jack Hood made his professional debut in September 1924 with a win over Joe Boswell. Undefeated in his first seven fights, he lost to Edouard Verret on a points decision in September 1925. He fought Verret again in January 1926, this time winning on points over twenty rounds. His next fight was a challenge for Harry Mason's British welterweight title, winning a controversial points decision over 20 rounds and earning a Lonsdale Belt.Lillington, Catherine (2011) \\"Boxer \\"Gentleman\\" Jack Hood's belt sells for ¬£36,000\\", Birmingham Mail, 12 September 2011. Retrieved 27 July 2014 A rematch two months later ended in the same result. In 1926 he travelled to the United States for a series of fights with the aim of securing a shot at the world title, which included wins over Paul Doyle and Meyer Grace, a draw with Jimmy Jones, and a defeat to Jack Movey. =British and Empire middleweight titles= An undefeated run back in the UK, including a knock-out win over European middleweight champion Bruno Frattini and a points win over Belgian cruiserweight champion Louis Wustenrad, led to a fight in October 1929 with Len Harvey, with British and Empire middleweight titles and a ¬£4,100 purse at stake; Harvey won, and retained his titles in a rematch in December after the fight was drawn. =Welterweight title= Hood's welterweight title was removed by the BBBofC in October 1931 after failing to defend the title. Over the next three years Hood fought with mixed success, including defeats to Harry Mason and Len Harvey, and two draws with Dave Shade and a draw with Vince Dundee, but in 1933 he got another shot at the British welterweight title against Stoker George Reynolds after initially turning down the fight as he deemed the ¬£500 purse inadequate; Hood won with a ninth-round knockout to regain the title. This led to a European title fight against Adrien Anneet in May 1933, which Hood won when Anneet was disqualified in the third round for throwing low blows. The fight was subject to an inquiry by the International Boxing Union, which confirmed the result in December. =Final boxing years= Promoter Ted Salmon unsuccessfully tried to get Hood a fight with Young Corbett for the world welterweight title in 1933, and Hood filed a challenge with the New York State Athletic Commission in January 1934 for a world title fight with Jimmy McLarnin, but he didn't get a chance to challenge for the title. Hood lost to Len \\"Tiger\\" Smith in February 1934, the match postponed from January after Hood fell ill with influenza, subsequently announcing his retirement from boxing and relinquishing the British welterweight title, saying \\"We must all bow to the inevitable, and being no exception I realise that my best boxing days are now past.\\" He returned, however, in October to fight Smith again, this time winning a points decision over 15 rounds, this proving to be his final fight. In an 11-year career he won 35 of 48 fights and in 6 defeats was only stopped once. Hood's Lonsdale Belt sold at auction in 2011 for ¬£36,000. Retirement from boxing Hood went on to run The Bell Inn, a public house, in Tanworth-in-Arden for 36 years. Death Jack Hood died on 1 July 1992, aged 89.

Hareendran Nair is an Indian Ayurveda physician and entrepreneur from Kerala. He is the founder of Pankajakasthuri group of enterprises, a business group which has contributed in promoting and popularising Ayurveda and ayurvedic products across the country. The Government of India, in 2012, honoured him with Padma Shri for his services to the cause of Ayurveda. Biography Hareendran Nair was born in a family with frugal means, at Kattakkada, Thiruvananthapuram, in Kerala to Janardhanan Nair, a document writer and Pankajam, as the youngest of their three children. After early education at the Government Upper Primary School, Kandala and the Christian College, Kattakada, he joined the Government Ayurveda College, Thiruvananthapuram from where he graduated in ayurvedic medicine with a BAMS in 1983. His medical career started as a research fellow at Poojappura Regional Research Institute but he submitted his resignation from the service when he was transferred to the central Kerala town of Shornur in 1986.

Early life  Berghofer was born in Denver, Colorado, and he moved with his family to Arcadia, California when he was eight. With a lineage of musicians in the family (his grandfather had played with John Philip Sousa, and his uncle played tuba with the Saint Louis Symphony), Berghofer took interest in music at an early age, playing trumpet at the age of eight. He also played the tuba in grade school and high school until moving to the double bass at the age of 18. As a young adult, as he began venturing out to jazz night clubs, he came to admire bassist Ralph Pe√±a and was able to persuade Pe√±a to take him on as a student. According to Berghofer he always felt as though his music was heavily influenced by Leroy Vinnegar, Paul Chambers and Ray Brown. He also admired the work of Scott LaFaro and told musician and journalist Gordon Jack, \\"The best soloist on the instrument was Red Mitchell ... I loved to hear him solo.\\"  Professional career  Two years after he took up the bass, Berghofer, joined an orchestra, led by Skinnay Ennis for a tour of the midwest and then joined with Bobby Troup. As his career progressed he eventually replaced his former tutor, Pe√±a, in a duo with Pete Jolly which later expanded into a trio with the addition of drummer Nick Martinis. In the 1960s he became a member of Shelly Manne's band, taking on a bassist position at Manne's night club Shelly's Manne-Hole and had the opportunity to play alongside numerous leading jazz musicians of the era including Jack Sheldon, Conte Candoli, Frank Rosolino, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Philly Joe Jones. He was a member of the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra around 1967 when Frank Zappa recorded the orchestral parts for Lumpy Gravy. Despite a lengthy career in film, Berghofer was also quite accomplished as a house jazz musician. He formed a semi-regular house band at Donte's in Los Angeles with pianist Frank Strazzeri and drummer Nick Ceroli and was videotaped having played with Roger Kellaway and drummer Larry Bunker as they backed Zoot Sims. Among others he accompanied were Ray Charles, Bob Cooper, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Peggy Lee, Shelly Manne, Gerry Mulligan, Art Pepper, Frank Rosolino, Seth MacFarlane, and Frank Sinatra. In 2019, Berghofer, along with fellow Wrecking Crew members Don Randi and Don Peake and in conjunction with Denny Tedesco (producer and director of the 2008 film The Wrecking Crew), performed around the Los Angeles area with their The Wrecking Crew's Farewell to Glen Campbell live shows. = Film = As Berghofer made his career as a jazz musician, he landed a prominent role recording with Nancy Sinatra in \\"These Boots Are Made For Walkin\\". He also worked on television with Glen Campbell, recorded with Frank Sinatra, and played with Barbra Streisand, in which they did a recording of Funny Lady. His film work extends to 400 appearances leading to his being awarded in the mid-1980s the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Award as the most valuable bass player for four consecutive years. In that decade he recorded with Mel Torm√© and later recorded again with Sinatra on Duets. Just a few of the films he worked on include Rocky I & II, On Golden Pond, Matrix, Majestic, Clint Eastwood‚Äôs Bird, and True Crime. He also worked on such television shows as Barney Miller on which he played the opening bass line, Charlie‚Äôs Angels, The Carol Burnett Show, The Simpsons and Star Trek Enterprise.

Plot After his father's death, a suicide by hanging, young Jack seemingly gains the ability to see and talk with souls who have not yet \\"gone into the light.\\" As Jack grows older, these souls ask him to become their 'Messenger' and relay their final words to those still living. This usually ends badly; as more often than not Jack's words, though honest, cause more misery and result in him getting kicked out of funerals or beaten up. Jack states time and time again that he isn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart, but in an effort to get rid of the souls haunting him, which doesn't happen until the task is completed. It's shown through countless, intermediate flashbacks that, as a child, Jack had been in and out of psychiatric clinics and hospitals all through adulthood, and as of the present, has been skimping on his prescribed medication. This, along the fact that he constantly drinks, has his current soul companion, a high-profile reporter by the name of Mark,worrying that his message to his recently widowed wife, Sarah, won't be genuinely received. Mark discloses that he was jumped on his way home by hooded figures and killed, staged to look like a successful suicide. He convinces Jack to reach out to his wife and tell her goodbye, while also revealing the fact that he knows about the baby growing inside her; this causes Sarah to become distressed, as the baby isn't Mark's. Jack, frustrated at how he's made the situation worse again, is taken into custody in response to Sarah's call to the police. Jack is taken to see a psychiatrist and is made to retell his story, eventually discovering that his father hadn't killed himself because of his mother, but that he was projecting his own bitterness and hatred for her. Seconds after he accepts help, Mark returns and insists that Jack help Sarah, who is attempting suicide by overdose. Jack initially refuses but relents when it becomes too much, eventually screaming hysterically for everyone to send help. He's sedated and taken away, though in the end, Jack's warnings stand true and the emergency response saved Sarah's life. Though the psychiatrist refutes the idea that his powers are real, saying that it's his mind trying to cope with his father's violent death, both the constable and Jack's sister, Emma, begin to believe in his powers. Afterwards Emma brings Jack a crystallized bug globe, a memento of their father, and Jack finally moves on from his father's death, crying and accepting help. During the story it is discovered that Jack's nephew, Billy, also sees lost souls, but has never told anyone. He discloses that he's haunted by the ghost of a boy who drowned in his family's swimming pool. The story ends with the reappearance of Billy and the ghost, while, at the same time, Emma, in the midst of cleaning Jack's apartment, finds a newspaper clipping detailing the death of a boy in her swimming pool.

Several short stories and novellas set in the world of The Powder Mage trilogy have been published, as well as an additional trilogy called Gods of Blood and Powder.http://www.brianmcclellan.com/all-books  Plot and Setting  The trilogy primarily takes place in the fictional kingdom of Adro, one of the Nine Kingdoms founded by Kresimir, a semi-mythical figure now worshiped as a deity. At the beginning of Promise of Blood, Field Marshal Tamas has just committed a coup d'etat against Adro's corrupt and ineffective monarchy. The novel then focuses on the efforts of three men ‚Äì Tamas, his son Taniel, a soldier, and former police inspector Adamat - in the aftermath of the coup, dealing with conspiracies by royalist supporters, war with Adro's neighbors, and an emerging scheme to \\"summon\\" Kresimir. The technology level of the Nine Kingdoms is roughly on par with that of Europe during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods; flintlock firearms are the prevalent weaponry. However, magic is present and its users are usually divided into three classes: *Knacked are the least powerful, with few or no active magical powers; instead, they have a variety of uncanny abilities; Adamat, for instance, has an eidetic memory, and Tamas's bodyguard, Olem, never needs to sleep; *Powder Mages are wizards with the ability to metabolize gunpowder and use it as fuel for various magical powers, including telekinesis; they can also manipulate gunpowder, such as causing it to explode spontaneously. Tamas and Taniel are both powder mages; *Privileged are powerful sorcerers; being exceedingly rare, they are almost exclusively gathered into \\"Royal Cabals\\" in direct service to the Nine Kingdoms' various monarchs; at the outset of Promise of Blood, Tamas has assassinated almost the entirety of Adro's Royal Cabal.

He was among a group of more than one hundred Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants in the American Civil War, at a time when the Kingdom of Hawaii was still an independent nation. Enlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, Bush served as a sailor aboard and the captured Confederate vessel , which maintained the blockade of the ports of the Confederacy. He was discharged from service in 1865 after an injury, which developed into a chronic condition in later life. The impoverished Bush was unable to return to Hawaii for more than a decade, during which time he traveled through New England and much of the Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of Kauai, where he settled down. In later life, he converted to Mormonism and became an active member of the Hawaiian Mission. After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his military service, and in 1905 was granted a government pension for the injuries he received in the Navy. He died at his home on Kauai on April 24, 1906. For a long period after the Civil War, the legacy and contributions of Bush and other documented Hawaiian participants were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. There has been a revival of interest, especially through the efforts of his great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis and others in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, the \\"Hawai ªi Sons of the Civil War\\" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. Early life James Wood Bush was born in Honolulu, on the island of Oahu. The date of his birth is uncertain; sources claim it to be October 1844,; 1845, or 1847‚Äì1848. He was the son of George Henry Bush (1807‚Äì1853), a native of Suffolk, England, who settled in Hawaii in 1825, and his Hawaiian wife. Bush was thus of mixed Native Hawaiian and Caucasian descent, known as hapa haole in Hawaiian, although in the United States he was referred to as a \\"half-caste\\". His older brother was John Edward Bush, who became a newspaper publisher and politician, serving as royal governor of Kaua ªi and a cabinet minister under the reign of King KalƒÅkaua. Little is known about Bush's life before 1864. Like his brother, he began his career as a sailor working on either merchant or whaling ships in the Pacific. Hawaiian sailors were highly regarded in the 18th- and 19th-century maritime industry. American Civil War After the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Kingdom of Hawai ªi, under King Kamehameha IV, declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. Some Native Hawaiians and Hawaiian-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) both abroad and in the islands volunteered to enlist in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Individual Native Hawaiians had been serving in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and more served during the Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawai ªi's ties to New England through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery. Bush served as a sailor on during the war. Arriving in New England at the beginning of the war, Bush enlisted at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for a three-year term as an \\"ordinary seaman\\" on September 27, 1864. During his service, he worked on and later the captured Confederate vessel , which chased blockade runners off West Florida as part of the squadrons responsible for maintaining the blockade of the ports of the Confederacy. He developed chronic laryngitis and spinal injuries due to his service in the Union Navy and was discharged in September 1865 at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital. When the war ended, the impoverished Bush had no way of returning to Hawaii. For the next decade, he lived in New Bedford, San Francisco, and Tahiti, finally returning to Hawaii in 1877. In 1905, after Hawaii became a US territory, Bush was granted a pension for his service in the Civil War, with back pensions dating from May 8, 1897. Later life After returning to Hawaii, Bush settled on the island of Kauai. In 1880, he was listed as the tax collector of Kawaihau, Kauai. In 1882, his older brother, in his capacity as Minister of the Interior, appointed Bush the Road Supervisor for the District of Hanalei to replace Christian Bertlemann, who had resigned. In 1887, Bush converted to Mormonism and was ordained an elder after two years, undertaking missionary work in the islands. He became the bishop of the Latter-day Saints ward in Kealia and hosted Mormon historian Andrew Jenson during his 1895 visit to Kauai.; ; In around 1894, Bush married a young girl at Lahaina, traveling to Kona after their marriage. \\"Hawaiian Veteran of Civil War Dies\\", Bush's death announcement in The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 1906 Bush died of heart failure at Kealia, Kauai, on April 24, 1906. In the last years of his life, he was a janitor at the Kealia prison. He was survived by his wife and son. Lorenzo Taylor, writing for the Deseret News shortly after Bush's death, said, \\"[H]e has taken an active part in the missionary work, doing much good among his fellow men. He has also been very kind to the elders, and his doors were always open to them. He was greatly beloved and respected by all who knew him. His life was a noble example of faithful and untiring devotion to the Gospel.\\" Bush is believed to be buried on Kauai, but the location of his grave is uncertain. According to Anita Manning, an Associate in Cultural Studies at Bishop Museum, \\"even the family can't find him\\".  Legacy After the war, the military service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawaii. Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian- American history has inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war. Stating that \\"our boys from Hawaii\\" should be remembered, Bush's great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis was influential in reviving interest and in the effort to install a memorial recognizing their legacy.; On August 26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu recognizing the \\"Hawai ªi Sons of the Civil War\\", the more than one hundred Hawaiians who were documented as serving during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy. As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and little is known about them due to the lack of detailed records. In 2015, the sesquicentennial of the end of the American Civil War, the National Park Service released the publication Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War about the service of the many combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaii's involvement and the biographies of Bush and others were written by historians Anita Manning, Justin Vance, and others.

Background The Fields were trustees of an estate that had a property for sale. In 1987, they entered into a sale agreement with Brent Paulin, with the buyer being referred to in the sales agreement \\"Brent Paulin or nominee\\". It was done this way, as Mr Paulin thought he could onsell this property to a 3rd party for a profit before the settlement date. Within 2 days, Fitton came along, who purchased Paulin's right to purchase for $15,000. However, when Fitton's solicitor informed the trustees that he was now the nominee for the purchase, they refused to deal with them directly, as they were worried that by dealing with a nominee, rather than Paulin, they might be liable for 2 separate amounts of stamp duty. The trustee's continued to deal with Paulin directly, however as Paulin had sold his interest, he ignored their requests to continue with the sale process, resulting in no settlement on settlement day. As a result, the vendors cancelled the sale. Mr Fitton, not happy with this development, sued the trustees, challenging the cancellation, claiming that under sections 4 and 8 of the Contracts (Privity) Act, he had all the legal rights to the sales agreement that Paulin had. Verdict Section 4 required a nominee to be \\"designated by name, description or reference to a class\\", and here this requirement was not met, as \\"or nominee\\" was not specific enough, as all that base nominated was a \\"bare nominee\\". Bisson J stated \\"It is difficult to treat a bare nominee not designated by name, as a person identified by description or as being within a designated class of persons. The nominee could be anyone at all. In the context of 4 designated means specified or identified so that if the nominee is not named, the word nominee in the contract should be qualified by the addition of a descriptive phase or the addition of the particular class within which the nominee falls so as to specify or identify the nominee in the manner required by s 4\\" This meant that the Contracts (Privity) Act did not apply here. But the legal argument was moot, as due to the fact that neither Paulin or Fitton settled the sale on the date of settlement, the trustees were able to cancel the sale contract anyway.

It reinforces in NZ case law the English case of G Scammell & Nephew Ltd v Ouston [1941] AC 251. Background The crown leased an airstrip in Te Hapupu, Chatham Islands from Barker Bros for a term of 5 years, with the lease giving the crown a right of renewal. Clause 2 stated \\"The terms and conditions of any such renewal renewed lease shall be as agreed upon the parties at the time, but the [renewed] rent shall not be less than the amount payable hereunder\\". Unfortunately, the lease gave no explicit method to calculate the new rent if the lease was later renewed. However, clause 18, was an arbitration clause which said \\"In the case of any difference or dispute arising as to any clause, matter or thing herein contained or implied, or by arising in any way in respect of this deed such difference or dispute shall be decided by ... [arbitration]\\". When the crown later tried to renew the lease, Barker Bros tried to substantially increase the rent from $6,750 per year, to $13,000, which the crown found was excessive and refused to pay. Barker Bros, then argued the lease had now ended, whilst the crown argued the dispute should be referred to arbitration, as per clause 18 of the lease agreement. As a result, the crown sought a declaration from the court to have the matter referred to arbitration, which Barker Bros defended (successfully) that the lease renewal clause lacked certainty i.e. a mechanism to set the new rent, making it an incomplete contract and thus legally unenforceable.

Water gins SWT 5 & 6 were picked up from Broken Hill. All carriages and both locomotives were overhauled and repainted at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. Several trial runs were made with the full train as far as Goulburn. Both locomotives had their buffers removed as they would operate on railway systems where rolling stock did not have buffers.

Typhoon Bopha originated from a tropical depression south of Pohnpei on November 25, 2012, and tracked generally westward for more than a week. During this time, it threatened several islands across Micronesia, prompting the issuance of typhoon watches and warnings. The system skirted the Nomoi Islands on November 28 where it caused limited damage. Thereafter, it became a threat to Palau as an intense typhoon. Residents there boarded up their homes and some evacuated to public shelters while officials enacted a strict curfew during the typhoon's passage. Bopha passed 55 km (35 mi) south of Angaur island, or 100 km (65 mi) south of Babeldaob, on December 2 with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Damage was most severe in the states of Angaur, Melekeok, Ngiwal, and Ngaraard where storm surge damaged or destroyed many homes. Electricity and water service in many areas was lost during the storm, and remained so for over a week in the hardest hit areas. Throughout Palau, 92 homes were destroyed while 59 others sustained severe damage. Total damage amounted to US$10.1 million with repair costs estimated at US$15‚Äì20 million. A state of emergency was declared on December 5 while the Palau Red Cross Society assisted with recovery efforts. Palau's congress allocated US$10 million for relief while international donors provided a collective US$235,000 in aid. Background On November 25, 2012, a tropical depression developed to the south of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. Initially tracking northwest and later due west under the influence of a strong subtropical ridge to its north, the system intensified into a tropical storm the following day at which time it received the name Bopha. The storm passed roughly 65 km (40 mi) south of the Nomoi Islands early on November 28\\\\. After slowly intensifying for several days Bopha underwent a period of rapid intensification from November 30 to December 1, with its central pressure falling from 990 mbar (hPa; 29.39 inHg) to 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). The system reached its initial peak intensity on December 2 with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated Bopha to have been a much stronger storm, with one-minute sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), a high-end Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). Around 06:00 UTC, Bopha passed 100 km (65 mi) south of Babeldaob island in Palau while at its initial peak. Shortly thereafter it made its closest approach the nation, tracking roughly 55 km (35 mi) south of Angaur island. After clearing Palau, Bopha ultimately intensified further before making a devastating landfall on Mindanao in the Philippines. The JTWC estimated its peak intensity at 280 km/h (175 mph), a Category 5 on the SSHWS. The storm resulted in up to 1,901 fatalities in the country and tremendous infrastructural damage. Land interaction substantially weakened the system by the time it emerged over the Sulu Sea. Turning north, Bopha briefly weakened to a tropical storm on December 6 before undergoing another period of rapid intensification. After reaching its tertiary peak on December 7, hostile wind shear caused dramatic weakening. In a 24‚Äëhour span, the typhoon's central pressure rose by 55 mbar (hPa; 1.62 inHg) while its winds fell from 170 km/h (105 mph) to 75 km/h (45 mph). Bopha soon degraded to a tropical depression and dissipated off the northwestern coast of Luzon early on December 9. Preparations Tropical Storm Bopha organizing near Micronesia on November 28 Upon the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's declaration of Tropical Depression 26W on November 26, a tropical storm watch was issued for Nukuoro and Lukunor in the FSM. Hours later, the watch was superseded by a tropical storm warning while new watches were declared for Losap and Chuuk. The watch was expanded during the afternoon of November 27 to include Poluwat. As the storm moved westward through the FSM and intensified on November 28, a typhoon watch was issued for Woleai; tropical storm warnings for the Nomoi Islands, Poluwat, and Satawal; a tropical storm watch was also put in place for Faraulep. Throughout November 29, watches and warnings were discontinued across the FSM, with all being canceled by the evening hours. During the morning of November 30, the remaining advisories were discontinued; however, new typhoon watches were issued for Koror, Ngulu Atoll, and a tropical storm watch for Yap and Sonsorol. Prior to the storm's arrival, the Micronesia Red Cross Society began stockpiling relief materials on Yap and Chuuk. Emergency communication testing, via satellite phones, was also conducted with regional offices. On November 30, residents in Palau were urged to secure their homes in preparation for the typhoon. They were also advised to stock up on emergency supplies that would last for at least three days. The storm delayed shipment of emergency food supplies to a boarding school on a remote island in Micronesia. Beginning on November 27 and continuing through December 3, the National Emergency Management Office in Palau issued more than ten detailed public announcements warning residents of the approaching storm and how to prepare. In response, numerous families boarded up their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic. On December 1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00 p.m. local time on December 2\\\\. All flights to and from Roman Tmetuchl International Airport were suspended during the morning of December 3. A strict curfew was put in place for the city of Koror for the duration of the typhoon. Impact Typhoon Bopha strengthening over Micronesia on December 1 Across Micronesia, impact from the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were estimated at 45‚Äì75 km/h (30‚Äì45 mph), resulting in minor damage to buildings and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000. During the early hours of December 3, Typhoon Bopha made its closest approach to Palau, bringing heavy rains and strong winds to much of the archipelago. Winds up to 215 km/h (130 mph) impacted Angaur and 160 km/h (100 mph) in Peleliu. Widespread damage took place across the republic, with the most severe occurring in the states of Angaur, Peleliu, Ngchesar, Melekeok, Ngiwal, and Ngaraard. Initial assessments stated that 92 homes were destroyed and 59 others were severely damaged; however, later reports stated that nearly 200 were destroyed. This left roughly 350 people homeless. Along eastern facing coasts, storm surge caused extensive coastal damage and, in some cases, pushed several hundred feet inland, cutting off roads and leaving behind several feet of debris. Hundreds of residents were forced to evacuate to higher ground as a result of the flooding. According to preliminary reports, Angaur Island experienced extensive damage from the storm. At least six homes were destroyed and travel was severely hampered due to downed trees and debris blocking roads. On Peleliu, eight large coral masses were driven onto the reef surrounding the island. Crops and vegetation across the island sustained heavy damage; however, most homes were reportedly \\"ok\\". On the main island of Babeldaob, the coastal states of Melekeok, Ngiwal, and Ngaraard reported that nearly all homes along the shore were damaged or destroyed by storm surge. Power and water service was almost completely lost across the three states as well. In Koror, wind gusts up to 110 km/h (70 mph) downed trees and power lines. Rainfall at the local National Weather Service office reached . Water and power systems across the republic were severely disrupted, with some areas remaining without service more than a week after the storm. Two schools in Ngaraard also sustained severe damage. Despite the severity of the storm, there were no reports of casualties. Across Palau, total damage to crops and property reached U$10.1 million while the cost to repair damage from the storm was estimated at US$15-20 million. Aftermath After the storm had moved through the region on December 2, officials began allowing evacuees to return home on December 3\\\\. The same day, all airports and roads were re- opened; however, some roads on Koror remained impassable due to damage from storm surge. Additionally, electricity shut off prior to the storm was restored on Koror. On December 5, the President of Palau declared a state of emergency and US$10 million was authorized by congress for relief efforts. The Palau Red Cross Society began distributing clean-up kits and communal tools in the eastern states of Melekeok, Ngaraard, and Ngiwal by December 7\\\\. Further distributions on the southern islands of Anguar and Peleliu began the following day. A week after the typhoon's passage, damage assessments across Palau had been completed and authorities had begun a large-scale reconstruction of damaged properties. The operation, known as the Bopha Catastrophe Relief Committee, was being coordinated by Dr. Patrick Tellei, president of Palau Community College. The committee planned to build 30 homes across the republic: 10 in Ngaraard and 5 each in Angaur, Melekeok, Ngiwal, and Peleliu. By December 12, telecommunications and water supplies were 95 percent restored while power had been brought back to 90 percent of capacity. Although water had been restored to most areas by December 13, residents were advised to continue boiling water, especially in more populated locales until further notice. Schools resumed classes on December 17 across the republic; however, several institutions were either temporarily relocated or had half days due to damage from the storm. On December 23, the Government of Palau announced that, \\"in the holiday spirit\\", December 24 and 31 would be declared national holidays for 2012 in light of the typhoon. In some areas, residents burned vegetative debris left behind by the storm. By December 12, Palau received a US$100,000 grant from USAID and US$25,000 from the Bank of Guam for relief efforts. On December 13, the Government of Japan offered ¬•5 million (US$60,000) worth of emergency goods, such as jerry cans and water purifiers, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The following day, the Republic of Korea provided US$50,000 in humanitarian assistance to Palau through the local Red Cross.

Elrington History of Dublin Vol. 5 \\"Howth and its Owners\\" University Press Dublin 1917 p. 135 He sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Ratoath between 1716 and 1727. He was regarded as a man of shrewd political judgement, and became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1739.Pine p.152 Marriage and children Shortly after succeeding to the title he married Lucy Gorges, fourth daughter of General Richard Gorges of Kilbrew, County Meath, and his first wife Nichola Sophia Hamilton. Nichola was the daughter of Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly and his second wife Susanna Balfour, and widow of Sir Tristram Beresford, 3rd Baronet. Lucy was more than twenty years her husband's junior, having been born shortly before her mother's death in 1713.Ball p.136 They had two sons, Thomas St Lawrence, 1st Earl of Howth, and a younger son William (died 1749), who became a professional soldier; and one daughter Mary (1729-1787), who married Sir Richard Gethin, 4th Baronet, and was the mother of Sir Percy Gethin, 5th Baronet of the Gethin Baronets of Gethinsgrott. =Jonathan Swift= His marriage to Lucy led to a friendship between Lord Howth and Jonathan Swift, who greatly admired her: he called Lucy \\"my blue- eyed nymph\\".Ball p.136 Swift became a regular visitor to Howth Castle, exchanged numerous letters with Lord Howth, and at Howth's request had his portrait painted by Francis Bindon.Ball p.136 Swift's regard for Lady Howth led him to importune his friend Eaton Stannard, the Recorder of Dublin, to use whatever influence he had on behalf of her brother Mr. Hamilton Gorges, who was standing for Parliament in 1734. Swift ruefully remarked that \\"I know of no other lady whose commands I would not have disobeyed on such an occasion\\", the more so since her brother was a complete stranger to him.Swift to Stannard, 12 March 1734 Scandal Scandal and tragedy visited the St Lawrence family in 1736. While the Howths were in residence at Kilfane, a cousin, Miss Barford and her friend Miss Hawley who were staying with them, were killed in a carriage accident.Ball p.139 When news of the tragedy reached Dublin, it led in a rather obscure fashion to a violent quarrel between Lord Howth's brother, Henry St Lawrence, and Lady Howth's brother, Hamilton Gorges (the same brother for whom Jonathan Swift had canvassed for a seat in Parliament two years earlier).Elrington Ball says that the immediate cause was a disparaging remark by Gorges about another St Lawrence relative, Mary Rice- History of Dublin p.140. St Lawrence challenged Gorges to a duel in which Gorges killed him. Gorges was tried for murder but acquitted.Ball p.140 The jury, as generally happened in such cases, accepted his plea that he had acted in self-defence.In the eyes of the law to kill a man in a duel was murder, but juries in the eighteenth century almost always acquitted, the popular feeling being that a duel was the proper way for gentlemen to settle a quarrel- Fleming, Thomas Duel Basic Books 1999. Character Elrington Ball describes William as a man of considerable gifts, keen insight and a humorous disposition, but far too fond of his own pleasure. He was a keen sportsman and a heavy drinker. At the same time he took a strong interest in improving agriculture, and as his last will shows, was notably charitable to the poor.Ball p.138 Death He died on 4 April 1748 and was succeeded in the title by his elder son, Thomas, who was created 1st Earl of Howth in 1767.Pine p.152 His widow remarried Nicholas Weldon of Gravelmount, County Meath in 1751.Pine p.152 Since Weldon was a Roman Catholic it was necessary under the Penal Laws for Lucy to obtain a royal pardon for the marriage to prevent forfeiture of her property rights, and this was duly granted in December 1751.\\"Pardon of George II to Lucy Lady Dowager Howth in respect of rents imperilled through her marriage to Nicholas Weldon, a papist\\" 13 December 1751 National Library of Ireland References Category:1688 births Category:1748 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Meath constituencies Category:Irish MPs 1715‚Äì1727 Category:Barons Howth ","title":"William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth"},{"id":"43405449","text":"Detikcom (stylized as detikcom) is an Indonesian digital media company owned by CT Corp subsidiary Trans Media.

The portal is consistently ranked among Indonesia's 10 most-visited websites and is among the top 250 in the world. It receives approximately 180 million visits per day. History Detikcom has its roots in DeTIK, which was Indonesia's top-selling and most critical political tabloid in the early 1990s. DeTIK was effectively banned on 21 June 1994, when Information Minister Harmoko withdrew its publication license together with Tempo and Editor magazine. DeTIK had upset the repressive regime of long-serving president Suharto by publishing interviews with senior military officers who were critical of civilian politicians. The tabloid had also dared to speculate on who would succeed Suharto. Following the resignation of Suharto on 21 May 1998, some journalists decided to set up an online news portal. Detikcom was originally founded by Budi Darsono (former Tempo and DeTIK journalist), Yayan Sopyan (former DeTIK journalist), Abdul Rahman (former SWA journalist), and Didi Nugrahadi. The domain name detik.com became active on 29 May 1998, however the site did not start producing content until 9 July 1998, which is considered its founding date. The founders focused on continuously updating breaking news, as well as more analytical news articles. Detikcom's first office was a small room at Lebak Bulus Stadium in South Jakarta. On 3 August 2011, Detikcom was acquired by Trans Media under CT Corp, owned by Chairul Tanjung. He has maintained the site's independent, neutral and unbiased media stance.

It suggests norms and standards for all evaluation offices in the UN and delivers thematic reports concerning monitoring and evaluation. It has 45 members and 3 observers listed below. History UNEG was created in January 1984 with the name ‚ÄòInter-Agency Working Group on Evaluation‚Äô (IAWG). It was part of the UN consultative group on programme questions (CCPOQ). It is a group of heads of UN evaluation offices which meet to discuss system wide evaluation issues. Its genesis owes much to the work of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) in particular Inspector Earl Sohm, JIU/REP/85/10 and JIU/REP/85/11. Much of its initial work was on designing, testing and introducing an M&E; system for UN operational activities in particular technical assistance projects. This was done by 1986. Most of UN operational activities were then funded by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) which provided the secretariat and the leadership for the Group. Policy and Strategy evaluation were paid insufficient attention initially. {An evaluation of the IAWG in the year 2000 pointed out that it needed to return to its proactive function with specific deliverables that could be used by the UN evaluation system in their work. The recommendations of the report highlighted the need for structured interaction among UNEG members, annual work planning, work groups to move the agenda forward and developing a website to enhance knowledge sharing. In 2003, the IAWG changed its name to the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG). Mission The mission on UNEG is to promote and support the independence, credibility and usefulness of the evaluation units in the UN system. According to its Strategy 2014-2019, UNEG's work is focused on four strategic objectives: 1) Evaluation functions and products of UN entities meet the UNEG Norms and Standards for evaluation; 2) UN entities and partners use evaluation in support of accountability and programme learning; 3) Evaluation informs UN system-wide initiatives and emerging demands; and 4) UNEG benefits from and contributes to an enhanced global evaluation profession. Membership UNEG currently has 46 members and 3 observers. Membership reserved for the units responsible for evaluation in the UN system, including the specialized agencies, funds, programmes and affiliated organizations. These units should have, or aspire to have, the required professional knowledge, experience and responsibility for evaluation as defined by the updated UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016).

He was awarded the Padma Shri, in 2012, for his contributions to the art of Koodiyattam, by the Government of India. Biography Sivan Namboodiri with Koodiyattam face makeup Koothambalam at Kerala Kalamandalam Guru 240px Sivan Namboodiri was born in 1950 to Ammankotu Manakkal Madhavan Namboodiri, a farmer and Devaki Antharjanam, as the youngest of their three sons, at Shornur, Palakkad, in the south Indian state of Kerala. He had his early schooling at Kanayam and Vadanamkurissi, but, being a poor student, had to drop out of school at Grade 7. He joined Kerala Kalamandalam, in 1965, at the age of 14, to learn Kathakali. During that period, the renowned Koodiyattam maestro, Painkulam Raman Chakyar, was in the process of setting up the Koodiyattam department at Kalamandalam and, on the insistence of Vallathol Narayana Menon, the founder of the institute, and K. N. Pisharody, Sivan changed his course to study Koodiyattam, as one of the two students of the first batch of Koodiyattam. Sivan was fortunate to learn the art from the masters such as Painkulam Raman Chakyar, Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair (Kathakali thespian), and Kalamandalam Krishnankutty Poduval (Chenda exponent). After the initial study of 6 years, Sivan enrolled for the post graduate course of 2 years at Kalamandalam. This was followed by an advanced course in New Delhi, with the help of a scholarship from the Department of Culture, Government of India. In 1975, he joined Kerala Kalamandalam as an instructor in the Faculty of Koodiyattam and, at present, is the most experienced teacher there. In 1980, University of Calicut invited him to be a part of the School of Drama where is working as a visiting professor since then. Sivan Namboodiri is married to Indira, Sanskrit teacher at a local school and the couple has two children. The family lives in Palakkad. Career highlights The highlight of Sivan Namboodiri's career came in Paris, when he performed two acts, Kailasoddhaaranam (Ravana lifting Mount Kailasa) and Parvathiviraham (Goddess Parvathi's separation from Lord Siva), before a UNESCO jury to select art forms to be considered for inclusion in UNESCO's Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The jury approved the inclusion of Koodiyattam subsequent to the show. He also performed in Germany at the Cologne Festival in 1980. Legacy Sivan Namboodiri was the first artist from outside the chakyar community to perform Koodiyattam. He is also considered as the first person to learn Koodiyattam in an institutional way; till his entry, Koodiyattam was taught under the gurukula system. Another first attributed to Sivan Namboodiri is that he was the first male to perform Nangyar Koothu which was the domain of nangiars, the ladies from Nambiar community. He is also credited with revolutionizing the Koodiyattam costumes and accompanying music.

Built during late 1909, it was soon discarded in favour of his next design, the Br√©guet Type III Design Like Br√©guet's previous design, the Br√©guet Type I, the structure was principally of metal, although less highly stressed parts such as the tail surfaces used wood. It had a triangular section fuselage of wire-braced steel tube with the air-cooled Renault engine at the front: this drove a three-bladed propeller which was connected to the engine's camshaft and so revolved at half the speed of the engine. The wings had pressed aluminium ribs threaded onto a mainspar of diameter steel tube. These were connected by a single interplane strut on either side. Tail surfaces consisted of a pair of horizontal surfaces, the lower carried on the rear of the fuselage and the upper by a pair of booms running back from the centre section of the upper wing. The upper surface was movable to achieve pitch control. A rectangular balanced rudder was mounted between the two horizontal surfaces. In addition a pair of small horizontal stabilising surfaces were mounted at the front of the aircraft either side of the engine. The pilot's seat was positioned halfway between the wings and the tail surfaces: a passenger seat was fitted behind the engine. The main undercarriage employed oleo-pneumatic suspension, and there was a single steerable tailwheel. It was intended that lateral stability would be achieved by automatic differential movement of the two halves of the upper wing, this feature being the subject of a patent filed by Br√©guet. In a turn, the greater speed of the outer wing would cause the angle of attack to be reduced, so eliminating the increase in lift that the greater speed would otherwise have produced. Lateral control was effected by a pair of mid-gap ailerons mounted on the interplane struts: these were evidently not effective and Br√©guet intended to use another method for lateral control in his next design. Operational history Its first recorded flight was made on 5 January 1910, when Louis Breguest made three circuits of the flying field at La Brayelle near Douai. and on 16 January 1910 it made a flight of However, by April 1910 Br√©guet was flying his next design, the Type III.

Throughout his oeuvre Harry van Gestel has created artworks ranging from sculptures to oil paintings. The artist is most known for his large abstract works, which range from 2 x 2 meters up to 3 x 6 meters large. Van Gestel has lived and created his work around the globe from Taiwan, Europe, United States, and South America. Now he resides back in Amsterdam with his gallery and studio in the city centre. Early life Harry van Gestel was born in Reusel. He Majored his studies in Botany and soon after graduating he combined his creative instinct with his studies. From the 1980s throughout the 1990s, he focussed on design and decorating projects for multinationals and large shopping malls throughout the Netherlands and the United States. In the late 1980s he moved to New York City to devote his life to his art. Throughout his live Harry van Gestel has lived in the Netherlands, Brazil, New York City, Los Angeles, London, and Taiwan.

The artist states: ‚ÄúWith every new work I try to surpass myself to a new way to astonish the viewer with composition that is embedded and communicates freedom‚Äù. His works are pure and his creations are not restricted by any conventions whatsoever. The artist describes his works as self-portraits in the sense that the artwork reveals a mirror image of the soul, energy and emotion of the artist at the moment of creation.Press Statement None of the artist's works have a title. Van Gestel states that a title for his works, that portray emotion through pureness of soul, does not add anything to the artwork and so only takes away all essential emotional value from the imagination of the spectator.

Based on the novel Venus in Furs by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the film was first released in 1969 in Germany under the title Venuz im pelz. In Italy, the film did not pass the censorship examination because of the sex scenes deemed too rough and all attempts to overcome the censorship's remarks, with various cut versions, were unsuccessful. The film was eventually released in 1973 under the title Venere nuda, but even this cut version was confiscated after a few days for contempt of decency. In 1975, the film was finally released in Italian cinemas under the title Le malizie di Venere, in a heavily censored version which was altered by a new editing and by the introduction of new scenes filmed by Paolo Heusch, which turned the film plot into a giallo. The new title was a specific reference to lead actress Laura Antonelli's box-office success in Malizia (1973).  Synopsis  Based on the infamous novel by Leopold Sacher-Masoch, the film follows the perverted passions of a young couple as Severin watches the beautiful Wanda writhing naked amongst furs. Being a peeping tom triggers a whirlpool of emotions due to a childhood episode which punishes voyeurism with pain.

History and architecture The former parsonage, adjacent to the church The Christian church at B√∂rje was probably preceded by a Norse religious site, perhaps a spring or a grove. The main parts of presently visible church (nave, choir and sacristy) were probably erected between 1310 and 1360, and built by the local community. The main models for the new church were Uppsala Cathedral and the Holy Trinity Church, also in Uppsala. The church porch was added before the middle of the 15th century. It received internal brick vaulting circa 1430-60. In the 1730s, the church windows were enlarged and the church whitewashed internally. Additional changes were made in 1796-97, and again in 1840-57. Renovations have been carried out in 1911-12, 1951, 1953 and 1959. During the 1953 renovation, medieval frescos were uncovered and restored. The main construction material of the church is fieldstone, with brick used for the windows and portal openings. The roof is made of shake. Internally, the vaults of the church are decorated with frescos. They date from the late 15th or early 16th century. They belong to a group of church frescos made by the so-called Tierp school; other frescos by this group of artists can be found for example in Roslags-Bro and S√•nga Church. The frescos in B√∂rje Church are unusually well preserved. The church houses a number of noteworthy items. The main altarpiece dates from the 1840s, but preserved in the church is also the original, medieval carved wooden altarpiece of the church. It was made in Uppsala, probably at the end of the 15th century, and depicts the Last Judgement and figures of saints. The baptismal font was made on Gotland and dates from the 13th or 14th century. The church also has a processional cross from the 14th century and a thurible made of bronze, dating from the 13th century. There is also an iron candlestick from the 16th century. The pews and pulpit are later, dating from the 17th century. There is a runestone immured in the church cemetery wall. Adjacent to the church lies the well-preserved former parsonage, with a main building erected 1785.

The history of the property dates back to the late 17th century but the name and current design of the building is from the 1750s when it was owned by the Holstein family and expanded by royal sculptor Jacob Fortling. Once home to the Natural History Museum, it now houses government offices. History =Early history= Illustration from Lauritz de Thurah's Hafnia Hodierna showing the Holstein Mansion as it appeared prior to the expansion in 1756. The original house was built for Hofmarschall Henrik Ulrik L√ºtzow in 1687. The two-storey, nine-bay house was possibly designed by General Building Master Lambert van Haven. In 1706, the house was expanded with a wide bay at both ends of the main wing and two perpendicular wings to the rear. The architect of this expansion was possibly Johan Conrad Ernst. After the expansion The property was purchased by Privy Councillor Johan Georg Holstein in 1726. His son, who inherited the mansion in 1730, acquired Ledreborg estate near Roskilde in 1739, continuing to use his house in Stormgade as his winter residence. Johan Ludvig Holstein's son, Christian von Holstein, commissioned court sculptor Jacob Fortling to carry out another expansion of the Holstein Mansion in 1756. The house remained in the hands of the Holstein family until it was acquired by Supreme Court Justice Christian Colbj√∏rnsen in 1807. =Royal Museum of Natural History= Johannes Theodor Reinhardt The Holstein Mansion changed hands twice more before it was acquired by the Crown in 1827. The building was then adapted for use as the Royal Museum of Natural History under supervision of J√∏rgen Hansen Koch. The naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund was associated with the museum. He made several journeys to South America and is particularly known for his examinations of limestone caves in Brazil. The zoologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt was appointed inspector of the Royal Museum of Natural History's 1st Department (mammals and birds) in 1848. He had previously participated in the Galathea Expedition 1845-47 and visited Lund in Brazil in 1848. =Later history= The Holstein Mansion in 1917 A new building for the Natural History Museum was inaugurated in Krystalgade in 1871. The building in Stormgade was sold to the insurance company Den almindelige Brandforsikring for Landbygninger (now Alm. Brand). The Ministry of Housing purchased the building when Alm. Brand moved to new premises on the Middle Pier in the Southern Freeport in 1971. Architecture The current exterior of the building mostly dates from Fortling's expansion in 1756. He added an extra floor topped by a balustrade decorated with vases and statues. The complex also comprises the two perpendicular rear wings from 1706 and a half-timbered building in the yard from the second half of the 17th century. Today The building was converted into 12 apartments in 2016. They vary in size between 90 and 386 square metres. List of owners * (1683-1700) Henning Ulrich von L√ºtzow * (1700-1711) E.U.

The Confucian University was opened in 1923, but the main church was never completed.Tay Wei Leong. SAVING THE CHINESE NATION AND THE WORLD: RELIGION AND CONFUCIAN REFORMATION, 1880s-1937. National University of Singapore, 2012. pp. 96-98 The Confucian church ( or ) is a Confucian religious and social institution of the congregational type. It was first proposed by Kang Youwei (1858-1927) near the end of the 19th century, as a state religion of Qing China following a European model.Ya-pei Kuo, 2010. The \\"Confucian church\\" model was later replicated by overseas Chinese communities,Yong Chen, 2012. p. 174 who established independent Confucian churches active at the local level, especially in Indonesia and the United States. There has been a revival of Confucianism in contemporary China since around 2000, which has triggered the proliferation of Confucian academies (); the opening and reopening of temples of Confucius; the new phenomenon of grassroots Confucian communities or congregations (); and renewed talks about a national \\"Confucian church\\".Billioud, 2010. p. 201 With the participation of many Confucian leaders, a national Holy Confucian Church () was established on November 1, 2015; its current spiritual leader is Jiang Qing. Kang Youwei's national Confucian Church The idea of a \\"Confucian Church\\" as the state religion of China was proposed in detail by Kang Youwei as part of an early New Confucian effort to revive the social relevance of Confucianism. The idea was proposed at a time when Confucianism was not institutionalized, after the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the Chinese empire. Kang modeled his ideal \\"Confucian Church\\" after European national Christian churches‚Äîhierarchical and centralised institutions closely bound to the state, with local church branches, Sunday prayers and choirs, missions, journals, and even baptisms, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of Confucius. The large community of Confucian literati‚Äîwho were left without an organization or an outlet for their rituals, values, and identity after the dissolution of state Confucianism, supported such projects. Similar models were also adopted by various newly created Confucian folk religious sects, such as the Xixinshe, the Daode Xueshe, and the Wanguo Daodehui. The Confucian Church was founded in 1912 by a disciple of Kang, Chen Huanzhang, and within a few years it established 132 branches in China.Billioud, 2010. p. 207 From 1913 to 1916, an important debate took place about whether Confucianism should become the state religion (guo jiao) and thus be inscribed in the constitution of China. This did not occur and anti-religious campaigns in the 1920s led to a full dissolution of the Confucian church. Modern churches and congregations While Kang's idea was not realized in China, it was carried forward in Hong Kong and among overseas Chinese people. The Hong Kong branch of Kang's movement became known as the \\"Confucian Academy\\" (), while the Indonesian branch became the Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia. Members believe in , with Confucius as the prophet (Indonesian: ). Chinese people in the United States established independent, local Confucian churches such as the Confucius Church of Sacramento or the Confucius Church of Salinas. In contemporary China, the Confucian revival of the 21st century has developed a variety of interrelated ways: the proliferation of Confucian academies, the resurgence of Confucian rites,Yong Chen, 2012. p. 175 and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the local level, such as Confucian communities. Some scholars consider the reconstruction of Chinese lineage associations and their ancestral shrines, as well as cults and temples worshiping natural and national gods from other Chinese traditional religions, as part of the revival of Confucianism.Fan, Chen. 2015. (a). p. 7 Other groups associated with the revival include folk religionsBillioud, 2010. p. 203 or salvationist religionsBillioud, 2010. p. 214 that have a Confucian focus. Confucian churches, for example the () in Beijing,Billioud, 2010. p. 219 the () of Shanghai,Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 29 the Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition, Phoenix Churches,Fan, Chen. 2015. p. 34 and the Confucian Fellowship () in northern Fujian have spread rapidly over the years since their foundation. Ancestral shrines of the Kong family have also reopened, as well as Confucian-teaching churches. The Hong Kong Confucian Academy has expanded its activities to the mainland, constructing statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoring temples and sponsoring other activities. In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded the Holy Hall of Confucius () in Shenzhen, inspired by Kang Youwei's idea of the Confucian Church. It is also affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture in Qufu, a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 as the Holy Confucian Church (). Chinese folk religion's temples and kinship ancestral shrines sometimes choose Confucian liturgy during special occasions (that is called , or sometimes ), led by Confucian ritual masters () who worship the gods enshrined, instead of Taoist or other popular rituals.Clart, 2003. pp. 3-5 \\"Confucian businessmen\\" () is a recently revived term to identify people among the entrepreneurial or economic elite who recognize their social responsibilities and therefore apply Confucian cultural practices to their business.Billioud, 2010. p. 204 Contemporary New Confucian scholars Jiang Qing and Kang Xiaoguang are among the most influential supporters behind the campaign to establish a national \\"Confucian Church\\".Angle, 2012. ¬ß Ritual, Education, and the State.

Located in the city centre, Musikhuset is Aarhus' main venue for music and with seating for more than 3,600 people in total, it is the largest concert hall in Scandinavia. Musikhuset Aarhus was designed by Kj√¶r & Richter and built in 1979-1982, commissioned by Aarhus Municipality. The surroundings are designed by landscape architect Sven Hansen. In front of the main glass foyer is the Concert Hall Park (Musikhusparken), a sculpture and parterre garden of boxwood with flowers, fountains and small seclusive corners with benches. A recreational lawn connects the park area with the City Hall Park. Between the concert halls and the adjacent ARoS art museum is a cobblestone amphitheatre hosting outdoor events and gatherings throughout the year. The building complex All in all, Musikhuset comprise six concert halls, nine stages and hosts more than 1,500 events every year for an audience close to half a million people. Musikhuset is built and equipped to also allow cultural experiences of a high quality for wheelchair users, the blind and people with hearing or vision impairments. A lofty 2,000 m¬≤ foyer with glass facades on three sides, leads into an anteroom and then into the main auditorium of Store Sal (Large Hall). The foyer occasionally hosts shows, concerts, exhibitions and business arrangements and can house up to 1,000 standing guest or 700 seated. It is home to caf√© and restaurant \\"johan r.\\", named after Johan Richter, the concert halls original architect. The restaurant has a small scene of its own, arranging about 300 free concerts annually. With its fully equipped stage, the main auditorium is designed for concerts, opera, ballet and musicals, but also large assemblies and meetings are held here. There is seating for close to 1,600 people. In 2011, Danish artist Mogens Gissel redecorated it in \\"wine red, curry yellow, mouse grey, nut brown, azure blue and pitch black\\". In an expansion project in 2005-2008, another large concert hall known as Symfonisk Sal (Symphonic Hall) was added, with seating for around 1,200 people, specifically built to host symphonic orchestral music concerts. Based on the proportions of the Great Hall of the Musikverein in Vienna, the Symphonic Hall allows adjustments of the walls, carpeting and acoustic panels in order to ensure the very best delivery of symphonic music. Musikhuset has four smaller halls, each individually built and equipped to host various genres. The smaller auditorium known as Lille Sal (Small Hall), has seating for 319 people and was originally designed for chamber music specifically. It has been updated with new technology and now also hosts theatre, rhythmic music concerts, conferences and cinema events. Rytmisk Sal (Rhythmic Hall) has seating for 465 people, but can accommodate up to 1,000 standing guests due to a changeable telescopic scene. The hall is known as the Rock 'n' Roll hall of Musikhuset, designed for rhythmic music specifically. Kammermusiksalen (The Chamber Music Hall) is constructed for chamber music, with wooden floors, light colours and a wall-sized window section for sunlight. With seating for 100 guests this hall is also used for meetings, lectures and warm-up events of various kinds. Both the Rhythmic Hall and The Chamber Music Hall are located in the new associated academy building, constructed during the 2005-2008 expansion project. The building complex is home to Den Jyske Opera (sometimes referred to as the Danish National Opera), Aarhus Symfoniorkester (Aarhus Symphony Orchestra), Teatret Filuren (a child theatre project) and Comedy ZOO Aarhus (an organisation for Danish stand-up comedy). With passageways of glass, steel and copper, the original concert hall building connects to the adjacent Royal Academy of Music built in 2007. The academy is also in yellow brick, but includes copper and has a somewhat different architectural design overall, designed by C. F. M√∏ller Architects.

Background  The village of Kewar falls under the Mahakali Union of Munshiganj Sadar Upazila in Munshiganj District. In 1971, the village was under Munshiganj police station of Dhaka district. The village was home to the renowned Chowdhury family, related to the Chowdhurys of Muktagachha in Mymensingh. The residence of the Chowdhury was spread over 7 acres and it housed a mutt, built on the tomb of Gourinath Chowdhury a scion of the family. On 25 March 1971 the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight. In Munshiganj, the army occupied the Haraganga College and set up and army camp. Some of the eminent Bengali Hindus of the region took shelter at the Chowdhury house at Kewar. Every night they used to guard the house in turns to get alerted of the enemy.  Killings  On the early morning of 14 May at around 4 am, a group of around 70 consisting of military men and the collaborators surrounded the Chowdhury house. They broke into the house and took hostage 22 Bengali Hindus. The hostages were taken to the banks of Satanikhil canal, a kilometer away. Sixteen of them were made to stand in a line and burst fired from machine gun. Fourteen of them died on the spot. Two survived, one of them identified as Jitu Bhaumik. Out of the remaining six persons, Kedareshwar Chowdhury and Dr. Surendra Chandra Saha were taken to the Haraganga College army camp. The former, popularly known as Jala Moktar, was the scion of the Chowdhury family and a pleader at the court and the latter a physician. Kedarshwar was first let off but again arrested and taken to the camp. The two were subjected to inhuman tortures and finally killed. The dead bodies were dumped in a nearby beel. Two rickshaw pullers who went to see the corpses two were killed. The rest four managed to escape by tricking their captors. One of them, Chandan Ambuli, managed to convince his captors that he was a Muslim.  Aftermath  The dead were not cremated. Nobody dared to cremate the dead.

History  Opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry with German Emperor Wilhelm II The German Emperor Wilhelm II asked Fritz Haber in 1912, shortly after the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin, for the construction of a warning system for the presence of firedamp.Dirk Van Laak: Deutscher als der Kaiser Within a year Haber developed the methane whistle and presented it to the emperor in a lecture on October 28, 1913. Haber tried hard to market the device and eventually signed a contract with the Auergesellschaft. Unfortunately, the device did not prevail, since the calibration of the pipes under working conditions in a colliery was not practical.Margit Sz√∂ll√∂si-Janze: Fritz Haber 1868-1934: Eine Biographie, Verlag C. H.Beck, 1998, , p. 240-242  Mode of operation  The simultaneous use of two equally-tuned pipes, of which one is blown with atmospheric air and the second with another gas, results in two only slightly different tones, called a beat. The function of the methane whistle is based on the fact that the sound when blowing a whistle depends on the speed of sound in the gas. The sound velocities of methane and air differ by about 31%. For a 1% methane-air mixture, the speed of sound is about 1.0031 times as high as in air. If the pipes are tuned to 440 Hz in air, the air-methane pipe has a frequency of 440 Hz √ó 1.0031 = 441.4 Hz. If two identically tuned pipes are blown by air and an air-methane mixture, the only slightly different tones produce a clearly audible beat. If the gas mixture changes in the resonator, then its resonance spectrum changes. By means of an absorber, interfering constituents of air such as humidity and carbon dioxide are removed. The methane whistle indicated methane levels in the mine air from 1 vol% and above.Fritz Haber: √úber Schlagwetteranzeige. In: Die Naturwissenschaften. 1, 1913, S. 1049‚Äì1051, .

It contains the toadflax relatives, such as snapdragons. They are probably most closely related to the turtlehead tribe (Cheloneae) and/or a large and badly resolved core group of their family including plants as diverse as water- starworts (Callitriche), foxgloves (Digitalis), and speedwell (Veronica). The Antirrhineae include about 30 genera with roughly 320 species, of which 150 are in genus Linaria. The type genus is Antirrhinum L.  Description and uses  A field of common snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus) grown in Jerusalem Most Antirrhineae are herbaceous, short-lived, perennial or annual plants growing at most about a metre/yard tall when in full flower; the maximum height of most species is half as much or less. Some are prostrate or twining. The flowers are often conspicuous, tubular with a basal appendix (spur, gibbous, or saccate) containing nectaries, and may be of any color, though yellow and blue/purple hues are most common. Multicolored flowers are a common occurrence in this tribe; a typical pattern is one conspicuous whitish or bright yellow or reddish spot at the lower outer edge of the flower tube, looking like a protruding tongue. Other characters include poricidal dehiscent capsule fruit, and the possession of iridoid glycosides. The Antirrhineae are not noted as food- or fodder plants, probably due to the iridoid content making them less than palatable. However, the tribe does not seem to contain highly poisonous plants, either; rather, use in folk medicine has been documented for a few species. While e.g. common toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) is credited with a range of uses by European herbalists, as of the 2010s, little scientific study has been made and the traditionally attested medical properties of the Antirrhineae are by and large unremarkable by standards of the Plantaginaceae, which abound with species of major pharmacological interest. The chief human use of the present tribe is for the flowers, primarily as ornamental plants in gardening. Colloquially called \\"the snapdragon\\", Antirrhinum majus is probably the single most widely known member of the Antirrhineae by far. A. majus cultivars can today be encountered essentially anywhere between Earth's polar circles, whether grown in a range of sizes and colours by hobbyists or field- scale for sale as cut flowers. In the hottest parts of the globe, it dies after one flowering, and in arid regions, other species may be more important, but otherwise it is extremely adaptable, and in warm-temperate climates, individual plants may survive for several years. The readiness with which A. majus flower colour and shape mutate and can be crossbred has led to the establishments of unusual (e.g. peloric) cultivars, as well as to making this species one of the first model organisms of genetics and helping uniting the theories of Darwin and Mendel. It remains a key model organism today in fields such as plant developmental genetics. Common toadflax has become established as a model organism more recently; while it may be an invasive nuisance weed in agriculture, like other toadflaxes and snapdragons, its attractive flowers make it useful as a wildflower. At present however, the other members of this family are generally only of minor or localized interest.  Taxonomy  = Subdivision= Developing capsule fruit in the unusual calyx of Rhodochiton atrosanguineum As the Antirrhineae have long been considered a distinct group, there has also been a long debate about recognition of distinct subdivisions. In 1909, RouyRouy, G. (1909): 'Conspectus' de tribus et des genres de la famille de Scrophulariac√©es. Revue g√©n√©rale de botanique 21: 194-207. separated the snapdragon-like subtribe Linarieae from the open-mouthed Anarrhineae and the monotypic Rhodochitoneae, the latter due to their petal- like calyx. By the mid-20th century, Rothmaler on morphological grounds identified five subtribes containing 21 genera: * Anarrhinum-Gruppe / Anarrhinae / Simbuletinae (monotypic) * Gambelia-Gruppe / Gambeliinae (3 genera) * Linaria-Gruppe / Linariinae (11 genera) * Maurandya-Gruppe / Maurandyinae (5 genera) - including Rhodochitoneae * Mohavea-Gruppe / Mohaveinae (monotypic) Mohavea confertiflora mimics the entirely unrelated asterid Mentzelia involucrata, misleading its pollinator Xeralictus beetles, as well as botanists researching Antirrhineae systematics Some 21st-century phylogenetic analyses indicate some quite different lineages. Mainly, the earlier authors seem to have overlumped the snapdragon-like forms (including toadflaxes) which actually do not seem to be closely related, while overemphasizing the morphological diversity of the true snapdragon relatives. As early as 1982, Speta had realized that the typical toadflaxes (including Nuttallanthus) were a lineage well apart from the snapdragons and similar genera, and established the Antirrhininae for the latter. In 2000, combining internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and morphological data from 16 genera, Ghebrehiwet et al confirmed Rothmaler's proposal of a close relationship between the fairly dissimilar-looking Maurandya and Rhodochiton and the distinctness of their lineage from the bulk of the subfamily. However, they found the \\"Linarieae\\" hard to resolve, but could already tell that Kickxia should be moved to the Anarrhinae, and Asarina and Cymbalaria to the Maurandyinae. In addition, Mohavea was recognized as a snapdragon relative with extremely modified flowers, refuting a monotypic Mohaveinae. Vargas et al in 2004 found six probable clades based on ITS and ndhF sequences of 22 genera, which they labelled as: * Anarrhinum group (2 genera) * Antirrhinum group (at least 7 genera) * Chaenorhinum\\"Chaenorrhinum\\" in Vargas et al (2004) is a lapsus. group (3 genera) * Gambelia group (at least 3 genera) * Linaria group (1 or 2 genera) * Maurandya group (at least 6 genera) However, they also noted profound morphological diversity amongst the Antirrhinum group, in accordance with the proliferation of segregated genera. Using ITS data from all 29 then-recognized genera, the 2013 study of Fern√°ndez-Mazuecos et al. identified six similar clades. They were able to assign all these genera to one of these clades, which they labelled as: * Anarrhinum clade (2 genera) * Antirrhinum clade (9 genera) * Chaenorhinum clade (3 genera) * Cymbalaria clade (9 genera) * Galvezia clade (3 genera)Ornamental cultivar 'Firecracker' of the disputed showy island snapdragon (Gambelia/Galvezia speciosa) * Linaria clade (2 genera) The most striking difference between the 2004 and 2013 results is the precisely inverted placement of Galvezia and Gambelia (one as core of a distinct clade,Gambelia ITS was not included in the 2004 study, but the Pseudorontium-Schweinfurthia clade is labeled \\"Gambelia group\\". Galvezia fruticosa was included in both studies. the other close to Antirrhinum as part of the Sairocarpus complex). Given the highly similar datasets and analyses, a clerical error confusing the two generic names might be suspected, but considering that the 2013 study included two species of each genus which congruently resolved as sister taxa, hybrid introgression, or a disparity between nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (ndhF) evolution or some other divergenceCompare the \\"suspicious\\" position of Antirrhinum in the rps16 intron analysis of Albach et al. (2005). seems a more likely cause. The erratic behavior of the two genera was noted by Vargas et al but not discussed in Fern√°ndez-Mazuecos et al.; adding to the confusion, Ghebrehiwet et al found a strongly supported Galvezia fruticosa-Gambelia speciosa clade excluding Pseudorontium and Schweinfurthia and equidistant from the true snapdragons and toadflaxes, entirely in line with Rothmaler's Gambeliinae. Furthermore, several species were historically moved between the two genera without authors noting anything suggesting against a very close relationship between them. Regarding internal phylogeny, at present, resolution is insufficient. In the more recent studies, the Chaenorhinum clade is fairly robustly resolved as sister to the true snapdragons, but otherwise not much is clear. Except for the Antirrhinum-Chaenorhinum and Linaria clades, all main lineages have resolved as basal in one recent study or another, but the proposed interrelationships between the clades/subtribes other than Antirrhinum- Chaenorhinum are at most tenuously supported in all of them. As it seems, however, Rothmaler's general concept of an ancestral radiation of basal lineages and a subsequent diversification of the toadflax-snapdragon group was essentially correct, even though he overlumped the latter. = Genera = As recognized around 1900 already, the Daisy-leaved Toadflax (Anarrhinum bellidifolium) is not truly a toadflax As of 2013, 29 genera are included in the Antirrhineae. Listed by clade, they are: * Anarrhinum clade / Anarrhinae **Anarrhinum Desf. **Kickxia Dumort. **Nanorrhinum Betsche Fairy Snapdragon (Chaenorhinum origanifolium) * Antirrhinum clade / Mohaveinae (disputed)Gambelia placed here by Fern√°ndez-Mazuecos et al.

In the 2013 study as well as in the 2005 Plantaginaceae analysis by Albach et al. Lafuentea indeed tends to resolve as an additional and basalmost lineage (subtribe in Linnean taxonomy) of the Antirrhineae, far from Digitalis, Oreosolen, Ourisia or Rehmannia; in fact, these five genera are apparently all distinct from each other at least at tribal level (Oreosolen and Rehmannia are even outside the Plantaginaceae). However, the results were not unequivocal and support for including Lafuentea in the Antirrhineae not very robust. Besides, the interrelationships of the Plantaginaceae tribes are also not at all robustly resolved, and some fairly close relatives of the Antirrhineae - such as Campylanthus or the singular Hemiphragma - have similarly uncertain positions as Lafuentea with regard to their presumed closest relatives. Thus, while Lafuentea seems to be a \\"living fossil\\" from near the origin of the Antirrhineae and is certainly highly useful as an outgroup in cladistic studies of their internal relations, whether its placement within this tribe is correct requires further study.

Reception The book resulted in extreme controversy, going as far as Keith being physically assaulted at a book reading. Aric McBay says that Keith is not being provocative for the sake of it, rather she believes vegetarians have the right impulse but are misinformed about the facts. Ian Fitzpatrick wrote that the book is at the core about the unsustainable nature of modern agriculture, but is \\"disguised\\" as a treatise against vegetarianism. Susan Schenck said the book was \\"full of hard core indisputable research\\". She agrees with the book's discounting of the contested scientific hypothesis on the effects of cholesterol on coronary heart disease. She further agrees with the book's claims linking soy with several ailments. However Schenck disagrees that vegetarians are necessarily unhealthy, believing each individual has different abilities to synthesize the needed nutrients from different foods. Patrick Nicholson writes that the book misinterprets scientific articles, cherry-picks facts, uses strawman arguments and relies heavily on anecdotes and faulty generalisations.Nicholson, P.

Noise immission is created by noise sources (noise emission) of various types which are propagating noise into the environment. A single source will create a certain level of immission primarily driven by originating sound power level and distance influenced by e.g. absorption and reflection. Several noise sources result in typically higher levels of immission. The method or process of determining the resulting immission level is called noise calculation, its graphical representation is called noise map. Noise calculation is done for the following reasons: * to calculate a current situation based on existing physics, mostly when a physical measurement at a location is impractical * to predict the resulting immission levels based on a planned change, e.g. set up of a new machine Mostly, noise calculation is part of any such planning process and may become part of the decision process for physical change Environment engineering differentiates between: * indoor sound propagation, e.g. occupational health considerations * outdoor sound propagation, e.g. city planning considerations as well as type of noise source, e.g. * industrial noise * rail or air traffic noise * road noise Each of before mentioned require different algorithms for noise calculation which have been defined over time in a number of different national or international standards. As an example, outdoor sound propagation is defined in ISO standard 9613 which can be received from the ISO organisation or scientific literature.  Calculation standards  This list of widely accepted noise calculation standards is incomplete, and new standards may be under development: * ISO 9613 parts 1 and 2 defines the calculation methods for outdoor sound propagation (International) * VDI2714 and VDI2720 Schallausbreitung und Schallschutz im Freien (outdoor sound propagation, Germany) * DIN18005 Schallschutz im St√§dtebau (noise protection in cities, Germany) * TA Laerm Technische Anleitung zum Schutz gegen L√§rm (Germany) * VDI-Richtlinie 3745 Blatt 1 Beurteilung von Schie√üger√§uschimmissionen (Germany) * BS 5228 Code of practice for noise and vibration control on construction and open sites (UK) * RLS-90 Richtlinien f√ºr den L√§rmschutz an Stra√üen (noise protection at roads/traffic, Germany) * CRTN calculation of road traffic noise (UK) * Schall03 Schienenl√§rm (calculation of rail noise, Germany)  Mathematical background   Data capture  NoiseScore is a mobile app for crowdsourcing community noise.

Its primary audience was American military personnel stationed in Europe, especially enlisted men and especially in Germany, reaching a circulation of about 50,000 copies a week. Sister publications eventually included Overseas Family and Overseas Traveler, as well as a Pacific edition during the height of the Vietnam War. Conflict with the U.S. military establishment was a frequent occurrence. The OW was founded by an American civilian, Marion von Rospach, and three male colleagues who were then completing their military service. With a capitalization of $3,000, they produced their early issues out of their homes and \\"an elderly Volkswagen.\\"Al Stump in True, July 1967 With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the men were retained in the U.S. Air Force and left Rospach to carry on alone. By focusing on stories too racy for the official military daily, Stars and Stripes, OW had a circulation of 15,000 by 1953, when the military establishment banned it from base newsstands. Rospach enlisted the help of California Sen. William F. Knowland and filed suit against the Secretary of Defense, Charles Erwin Wilson, actions that succeeded in lifting the ban and increasing its profile. Rospach rented offices in the Frankfurt Press Club, contracted with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to print the newspaper and hired a staff of German and expatriate civilians and former U.S. military men, with the Americans paid a starting salary of $60 a week, later raised to $70. An early hire was a German-born ex-serviceman, John Dornberg, who became the paper's news editor. The OW was a tabloid whose front page featured a partially clad young woman and two or more enticing headlines-- sometimes printed in red ink--on the lines of \\"LT SEDUCED MY WIFE, GENIUS GI TELLS COURT.\\"Newsweek, July 18, 1966. Courts-martial, generally not covered by the Stars and Stripes, were a news staple, along with more pin-up photos, the comic strip Beetle Bailey and an editorial bias that favored enlisted men over their officers. To the military it was known as the \\"Oversexed Weekly\\".Time, June 09, 1961. In 1958 Rospach added a second weekly, the Overseas Family, edited by Cecil Neff and more genteel in content, to appeal to the wives and children of military personnel. In 1961 an OW reporter broke the story of the \\"pro-Blue\\" program sponsored by Maj. Gen. Edwin Walker, commander of the U.S. Army's 24th Infantry Division in Augsburg. In a front-page story, the newspaper accused Walker of brainwashing soldiers with right-wing materials from the John Birch SocietyOverseas Weekly, Apr. 16, 1961. In return, Walker condemned the OW as \\"immoral, unscrupulous, corrupt and destructive.\\"Time, June 09, 1961. Relieved of his command and passed over for promotion, Walker resigned from the U.S. Army that October. Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker Admonished June 12, 1961. About this time Rospach hired a recently discharged serviceman, Curtis Daniell, who became the OW's executive editor in 1963, when the newspaper reached a weekly circulation of about 50,000. As the Vietnam War began to intensify, Daniell hoped to publish a Pacific edition but was refused space on military newsstands in South Vietnam. Nevertheless, in 1966 he sent reporter Ann Bryan to Saigon to establish a bureau there, and in time she won permission to publish a Pacific edition of the OW, printed in Hong Kong and flown to Saigon each week.

L.P\\", drawn by John Preston Neale in 1818. Part of series of six volumes published from 1819 to 1823. Ashley Park is a private residential neighbourhood at Walton-on-Thames in Surrey. Its central feature was a grandiose English country house, at times enjoying associated medieval manorial rights, which stood on the site, with alterations, between 1605 and the early 1920s. Its owners included Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset, in the 18th century and members of the Sassoon family around the turn of the 20th century. The bulk of the estate was developed into detached houses in the inter-war period, often rebuilt since in a modernist style with American influences; older examples tend to be in the Arts and Crafts style, its principal local exponent being Walter George Tarrant. Houses sold by its development company are more strictly subject to covenants mandating low density residential development. History =Former house and owners of the estate= The manor here was recorded in forms similar to and including Asshlees in 1433 in the hands of Joan widow of Robert Constable who held it of the Crown. This was a relatively small manor measured at as to its earliest demesne which was later extended. It is believed to have been mainly woodland with some lawns and fields. The manor was one of those incorporated into set of manors (the 'honour') of Hampton Court under the passing of the Hampton Court Manors or Manors of Hampton Court Act, 1539. The construction of the first properly documented \\"Ashley House\\" was by Lady Jane Berkeley in 1602‚Äì05 and it was altered over the centuries until demolition between 1920 and 1925. Whether a relief (livery of seisin) was not paid, no heirs existed or through attainder, Ashley Manor escheated to the Crown before and after Berkeley's ownership as was common of many manorial estates in that period. The manor and Walton Lee and Walton Meads were granted (that is to say, the chief tenancy of the same) by James I of England to Henry Gibb in 1625; but the house may already have been long-let to wealthy tenants - it was long leased by 1630 to the brother of the King's favourite (the Duke of Buckingham) Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey who lived at Ashley Park and died in Windsor in April 1630. It may have been he who extended the estate as he was before ennoblement successively Gentleman of the Horse; Gentleman of the Bedchamber; Master of the Robes and five years after being granted his earldom Chief Steward or Keeper of the Honour of Hampton Court in 1628 supplemented by that of Bushy Park the year after.Cokayne, and others, The Complete Peerage, volume I, page 132. Lord Anglesey's widow, Elizabeth married in 1641 Benjamin Weston one of ten children of the financially astute Lord Treasurer to King James and King Charles, Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland; they continued to live there until she died in 1662.Nichols, p. 192 Multiple owners or tenants of short duration followed before it was bought by Field Marshal Viscount Shannon in 1718, who purchased from the estate of Sir Richard Pyne, retired Lord Chief Justice of Ireland (1695-1709); he bought the manorial rights which were until then held separately, and he died at the house, 20 December 1740. Lord Anglesey and Lord Shannon are buried and memorialised in the parish church of Walton-on-Thames. Lord Shannon's heir and only child Grace became by marriage The Countess of Middlesex (d.1763). By her Will and by virtue of her husband dying like her childless in 1769, the estate passed to her cousin Colonel John Stephenson and thereafter his sisters. The house was inherited by a cousin of these sisters: Sir Henry Fletcher, Member of Parliament for Cumberland in 1786 and stayed in his family until it was bought by Sassoon David Sassoon shortly before his death in 1867; his grandson Sassoon Joseph Sassoon and young family were the final owners of the house.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh. Burke's Irish Family Records, Burkes Peerage, page 691 (London) As to the final form of the house it is recorded the second Fletcher heir, among the title back-named since the 4th generation Aubrey-Fletcher baronets, \\"pulled down a great deal of the house at Ashley Park\\".George Edward Cokayne, editor, The Complete Baronetage, 5 volumes (no date (c. 1900); reprint, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 1983), volume V, page 219. Hereinafter cited as The Complete Baronetage. Other uses =Former Golf Club= Ashley Park Golf Club appeared in the 1890s but ceased to exist prior to the First World War. The house itself remained in the Sassoon family until it was demolished in 1920. =Subdivision into individual plots= Redevelopment occurred in three phases: #Early construction of Walton-on-Thames station in railway history - May 1838 - caused the owners to sell minor land for building for cottages nearest to the railway and along public roads. #An advent in commuting to the City of London led to clusters of planned houses at the north end of Ashley Road and at the Halfway by 1874 and a major reduction in eastern parkland.Trigonometrical Survey with the roads, parks and railways, (map) Jason Wyld, 1874. Also republished elsewhere e.g. http://mapco.net/surrey1874/surrey15.htm #Executors of the S. Joseph Sassoon estate in the 1920s needed to pay the Crown the newly increased form of death duties and provide for heirs. The increasingly costly House was demolished. The 18th century Dower House (with two renamed wings) on Oatlands Drive was not demolished, its large cottage-style terrace of three houses is listed, mainly for heritage. The rump of the estate was sold to a purposely incorporated development company which sold high-class building plots and houses subject to and benefitting from covenants of a high initial minimum price and prohibiting non-detached houses. Roads in the final phase of sales were not offered to the local authority, limiting pavements. The scale of development has preserved many trees planted on parts which were once variously its golf course, owner's private parkland and scattered centuries- old, diverse woodland. The north-west extreme of the park became the tree- lined public green space which shares its name and in the late 20th century developed a home maintenance superstore and surface car parks. The architecture of houses is mainly inter-war Arts and Crafts style, its principal local exponent being Walter George Tarrant, who may have worked on grander examples.

Background Untapable is a bay filly with a white blaze and three white leg markings bred in Kentucky by Winchell Thoroughbreds. She was sired by Tapit, a gray son of Pulpit, who won the Wood Memorial Stakes and started second favorite for the 2004 Kentucky Derby. Tapit has become a successful breeding stallion with other progeny including Tonalist, Hansen, Stardom Bound, Tapitsfly (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf) and Tapizar (Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile). Untapable's dam Fun House was a successful racemare who won five races including the Grade II Buena Vista Handicap. Fun House's dam Bistra was a half-sister to the Hollywood Derby winner Olympio. Untapable is trained by Steve Asmussen and has been ridden in most of her races by Rosie Napravnik. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= Untapable began her racing career at Churchill Downs. In a maiden race on June 20, 2013 she took the lead soon after the start and won by a length from Harlan's Special. In September, Untapable was moved up in class and distance for the Grade II Pocahontas Stakes over eight and a half furlongs and finished strongly to win by half a length from tonetastic at odds of 5.8/1. On November 2, Untapable started the 11/2 fourth choice in the betting for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Santa Anita Park. She appeared beaten when hampered by the fall of Secret Compass and came home eighth of the nine finishers behind the subsequently disqualified She's a Tiger. Joseph Talamo took over the ride from Napravnik when Untapable ran in the Starlet Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack on December 7 when the filly finished third behind Streaming and Taste Like Candy. =2014: three-year-old season= Untapable began her three-year-old season at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana. On February 22 in the Grade III Rachel Alexandra Stakes over nine furlongs she started third favorite behind Ria Antonia and Got Lucky. She raced on the outside before moving up to take the lead in the straight and won very easily by nine and a half lengths from Got Lucky. After the race Asmussen said \\"The filly acted extremely well today...we just think she's a better mare than she was last year, and she showed it today\\" whilst Napravnik commented \\"I had lots of confidence in her. It was a wide trip which just goes to show you how much the best she was\\". Five weeks later she started 1/2 favorite for the Grade II Fair Grounds Oaks over eight and a half furlongs. She took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by seven and three quarter lengths from Fiftyshadesofgold. Asmussen said \\"She has grown up a lot, and she has great composure... and she's fast. I like how she was handled by Rosie, how she relaxed, and she ran big, especially off such a fast effort in the Rachel Alexandra\\" whilst Napravnik admitted to being \\"very excited about her\\". On May 2, Untapable started favorite for the Kentucky Oaks over nine furlongs at Churchill Downs with her main opposition appearing to come from the Gazelle Stakes winner My Miss Sophia and the Ashland Stakes winner Rosalind. Drawn wide in stall 13, the filly settled in fourth place before moving up to take the lead from My Miss Sophia on the final turn. In the straight she went clear of her opponents before being eased in the closing stages to win by four and a half lengths. After the race, Napravnik commented \\"She was really great. She got into a great stride and relaxed. She is magnificent\\". On June 28, Untapable started at odds of 1/20 for the Mother Goose Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Belmont Park. After being hampered in the early stages, Untapable, ridden by John Velazquez moved up to take the lead on the final turn and pulled clear to win by nine and a quarter lengths from Princess Violet. Untapable's connections opted to race her against colts in her next race, hoping she could become the third filly, after Serena's Song and Rachel Alexandra to win the Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park. Racing on the outside of the field, Untapable (the 7/5 favorite) made some progress approaching the straight but never threatened the wire‚Äìto‚Äìwire winner Bayern and finished fifth, beaten more than nine lengths. Napravnik reported that \\"the horse next to us (Social Inclusion) acted up in the gate, so she got a little fussy and didn't get away well. We had the widest trip of everybody; she ran a hell of a race and ran as hard as she could\\". Untapable returned to competing against her own sex in the Cotillion Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Parx on September 20 in which she was expected to be matched against Stopchargingmaria the winner of the Alabama Stakes and the CCA Oaks. The race lost some of its interest when Stopchargingmaria was scratched. Napravnik tracked the leaders Jojo Warrior and Cassatt before sending the 1/2 favorite into the lead approaching the final furlong. Untapable held off the late challenge of Sweet Reason and won by a length in atime of 1:42.30. Untapable took on older fillies and mares for the first time in the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Santa Anita on October 31 and started 8/5 favorite. Her biggest danger appeared to be the five-time Grade I winner Close Hatches while her other rivals included Belle Gallantey (Beldame Stakes), Iotapa (Vanity Handicap) and Don't Tell Sophia (Spinster Stakes). Forced to race on the outside she made rapid progress on the final turn before taking the lead from Iotapa entering the straight. She stayed on strongly to win by one and a quarter lengths from Don't Tell Sophia, who finished a nose in front of Iotapa. Asmussen said \\"I can't say enough about her and how proud I am of her. She's an amazing mare to put us on this stage and to perform like she did. Rosie and she are a great combination and they have had a tremendous season. Today, definitely makes her a champion and that's enough said. She's had a great year and she's a great filly.\\" After the win, Napravnik announced that she was seven weeks pregnant and would be taking a \\"retirement\\" of \\"indefinite\\" duration. =2015: four-year-old season= On January 17, 2015, Untapable won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly by a unanimous vote. Rebounding from her March 14, 2015 debut loss in the Azeri Stakes, Untapable took the Grade I Apple Blossom Handicap on April 10. The winner of the Azeri, Gold Metal Dancer, placed. For the rest of the year Untapable ran consistently without recovering her best form and posted a string of placed efforts in major distaff races. She finished second to Wedding Toast in the Ogden Phipps Stakes, second to Stopchargingmaria in the Shuvee Handicap, third to Sheer Drama in the Personal Ensign Stakes and second to Got Lucky in the Spinster Stakes. It was expected that she would attempt to defend her Breeders' Cup Distaff title but was scratched three days before the race after she was found to be running an abnormally high temperature. =2016: five-year-old season= Untapable made her seasonal debut in the Azeri Stakes for the second year in succession and as in 2015 she was beaten at odds-on, going down by a neck to Call Pat. She failed to recover her form in her two remaining races, despite starting odds-on on both occasions: she finished fourth in the Apple Blossom Handicap in April and fourth in the Grade III Fleur de Lis Handicap on 18 June at Churchill Downs. On June 19, 2016 it was announced Untapable had been retired from racing.

Hinckley. A previous attempt at missionary work was made in 1854 when Brigham Young sent four missionaries to Thailand (Siam at the time). The only missionary to arrive was Elam Luddington whose only baptisms during his four- month service in Thailand were a non-Thai ship captain and his wife on April 9, 1854. The first known baptism of a native in Thailand was for Nangnoi Thitapoora on September 11, 1966. The Book of Mormon was translated twice. The first translation, which took about six years, was completed in 1976 by Srilaksana Suntarahut. A new translation was completed in 2010. Missionary work was challenging in the 1970s and 1980s because of restrictions from the Thai immigration that prohibited more than 100 missionaries in Thailand at a time and required that missionaries leave the country every 90 days to renew their visas. Baptisms grew after 1992, when the law was repealed and missionaries were required to renew their visas only one time during their two-year service. The Thailand Bangkok mission was established on July 19, 1973 with Paul D. Morris and the first stake in Thailand was organized on June 19, 1995 by Neal A. Maxwell. In April 2015, Thomas S. Monson announced plans to build the first temple in Thailand in Bangkok; this project is expected to be completed in the next three to four years. As of 2018, the LDS Church reported 22,100 members and one mission in Thailand, with a temple announced in 2015. History =Beginnings= In the early 1850s, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brigham Young, sent four missionaries to serve in Siam (Thailand). Upon arriving in Calcutta, India in 1853, only two of the four missionaries remained assigned to serve in Siam as a result of challenges due to the war between the Burmese government and the East India Trading Company. Elam Luddington and Levi Savage attempted to sail to Siam from Burma, but were forced to return to India when their ship encountered problems. They arrived in Burma in August 1853. Because Savage was too ill to go to Siam, Luddington arrived in Siam alone on April 6, 1854. Luddington's only baptisms were the ship captain, James Trail and his wife, three days after his arrival. Luddington would spend a little over four months in Siam, working only with European residents as he was unable to speak Thai. During his service, Luddington was stoned twice and poisoned once. Luddington returned to San Francisco on June 27, 1855 due to his lack of success and the language barrier. =Missionary efforts= The influence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was largely absent from Thailand for about a century. Church members in the 1950s and early 1960s held informal church services before they were given official authorization to hold church meetings in Bangkok in 1961. Some small congregations of United States servicemen were established on some United States Air Force bases during the Vietnam War. In 1962, president of the South Far East Mission Robert S. Taylor organized the first official congregation of church members. LDS military servicemen added numbers to the group during the war. In 1973 and 1974, Gordon B. Hinckley traveled to Thailand to inquire as to whether the country was prepared for proselyting. A Mutual Improvement Association was organized in September 1964, meeting in a private restaurant after having outgrown the living room of a home. The first non-Thai person baptized in Thailand since 1854 was a serviceman named Jim McElvee. He was baptized on January 21, 1966. On March 27, 1966, Keith E. Garner organized the Thailand District of the Southern Far East Mission with Stirling Merrill as president. The congregation in Bangkok had over 200 members by July 1966, so the Bangkok Branch (the first in the country) was organized with Gordon M. Flammer as Branch President. The country was officially dedicated for missionary work by Gordon B. Hinckley on November 2, 1966 in Lumphini Park. The mission became a part of the Southern Far East Mission, presided over by Keith B. Garner. Hinckely found property for $77,000 for a chapel, which was purchased in 1967. Due to struggles receiving Thai government approval, it wasn't until February 2, 1968 that missionaries were allowed to enter the country. Six missionaries from Taiwan and Hong Kong were transferred to Bangkok. Soon thereafter, the missionaries began an intensive three week language program at the American University Alumni School and had the missionary lessons translated into Thai by a translator. Full-time proselyting began on March 6, 1968 and the first missionary lesson was held in the Thai language on March 17 with the help of Anan Eldredge. Boonepluke and Rabiab Klaophin, baptized on May 15, 1968, were the first converts by missionaries in Thailand. President Garner of the Southern Far East Mission made the decision in June 1968 to send missionaries to Korat, the third largest city in Thailand. The influence of the Church grew quickly in Korat, with baptism services held monthly. W. Brent Hardy replaced Garner as president of the Southern Far East Mission in July 1968. Re-translations of the missionary lessons were initiated, but this was difficult because the hired translators were unfamiliar with LDS terminology and the Thai language doesn't have equivalent words for Christian subjects. In December 1968, Ezra Taft Benson, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, attended a quarterly district conference in Bangkok. There, he had the opportunity to meet King Rama IX of Thailand. Benson personally presented the King with a Thai Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith's Testimony, and a copy of Meet the Mormons.; By the end of 1968, there were eight missionaries working in Thailand. In 1969, the numbers had grown to twenty-five missionaries. For a short period of time beginning in 1969, Thailand become a part of the Southeast Asian Mission with G. Carlos Smith Jr. as president, allowing more time to be focused on Thailand as a mission country, allowing missionary work to move faster. Construction began on the Asoke Chapel, on the property that was purchased in 1967, in 1970, mostly funded by LDS servicemen stationed in Thailand. After a slow construction process, in August 1974, the first Latter- day Saint chapel was dedicated in Bangkok. In 1970, missionaries were sent to Chiang Mai and Khon Kaen with twelve other cities opening up for missionary work in the six years that followed. Smith created a missionary basketball program in 1969 to increase visibility of the Church in the surrounding areas. The team played in tournaments and received much publicity. In August, Music and the Spoken Word from Salt Lake City was aired over Thai radio in Korat and an open house program was initiated in Chiang Mai. The general missionary approach at the time was to introduce non-members to the LDS church in a casual and non-threatening manner. In order for missionaries in Thailand to have closer supervision, the Thailand Mission was created with Paul D. Morris as president on July 19, 1973.; The name was changed to the Thailand Bangkok Mission on June 20, 1974. Morris's experience with Asia and Asian culture allowed him to improve LDS-Thai relations, working to adapt teaching materials and pictures to the Thai culture. Morris initiated translation work of books and church manuals, strengthened local leadership, increased media attention of missionaries and members through the radio, and encouraged local members of the church to publish articles about the Church in local newspapers. During his presidency, women missionaries were sent to Thailand, in part to help with welfare services. Harvey D. Brown became the second president of the Thailand Bangkok Mission in August 1976. His presidency focused on building and re- building the image of the church in Thailand. A missionary singing group called Sidthichon Yuk Sud Tai (\\"the Latter-day Saints\\") was created and they toured the country, performing in front of thousands, blending Western and Thai sounds. They performed on television in Bangkok and received good reviews, increasing interest in the LDS Church. The group raised money for charities and programs such as the Thai International Red Cross, Bangkok Teachers College, hospitals, and a drug rehabilitation program. They received an invitation to perform for the King's charity event, meeting the King and Queen afterwards. During its nearly three year long existence, the group appeared on TV 70 times, recorded five albums, performed for royalty three times, and did 500 live performances for over one million people in all of Thailand's major cities. After the visa problems improved and the Church was viewed more positively, the group was disbanded by Brown in July 1979, having fulfilled its intended purpose. At the end of 1976, 170 missionaries were serving in Thailand; however, government pressured required the missionary count to drop to 125 missionaries. By 1985, less than 100 missionaries served in Thailand. Requirements that missionaries renew their visas every ninety days furthered missionary difficulties. Because the Cambodia border was closed due to an internal war, missionaries were forced to make expensive and long journeys to Malaysia. This policy was changed in 1992. In 1980, Marion D Hanks became the Executive Administrator over Southeast Asia. He created a refugee mission that took care of refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from the Vietnam War in Thailand and also preached to them for ten years. In 1988, Anan Eldrege was the first Thai to preside over the Thailand Bangkok Mission. He initiated the first temple excursions to the Philippines. First Thai church members The first Thai convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was Nangnoi Thitapoora who was baptized on September 11, 1966. The first Thai male convert was Anan Eldredge, who was baptized on December 24, 1967. The surname Eldredge comes from the surname of a Latter-day Saint family working in Thailand who offered to adopt him so he could attend college in the United States. Anan was a great help to the missionaries working in Thailand after his baptism, helping them with the language and translation of church materials. Anan Eldredge became the first Thai to serve a full-time mission. Eldredge attended college in California and met and married a Latter-day Saint woman from England. Eldredge helped work on the revised translation of the Book of Mormon into Thai, and helped with the translations and publishing of the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price into Thai. In 1988, Anan Eldredge became the first Thai president of the Thailand Bangkok Mission, influencing a steady increase in church membership during his service. =Translation of the Book of Mormon= The first translation of the Book of Mormon was principally done by Srilaksana Suntarahut. Her father was the doctor for the monarchs Vajiravudh and Indrasakdi Sachi. Srilanksana was adopted by the Queen and spent her childhood living in the palace where she received an exceptional education. After Srilaksana met the missionaries, she was baptized on July 4, 1968 with two of her daughters. The church originally intended to use a professional translator, but felt that it would be better if the translator was knowledgeable about the Book of Mormon and the Church. Regardless, a paid translator was chosen and along with help from a committee of Thai church members including Srilaksana. The Book of Mormon began to be translated in 1970. Srilaksana struggled with severe health problems during the translation process. After Prayun, the professional translator's contract was finished, Srilaksana became the principal translator of the Book of Mormon at the beginning of 1971. She did not receive payment for her work until the Thailand Bangkok mission was formed in 1973. She would review and correct the previous translation and the translation committee, largely consisting of missionaries, would make sure the doctrinal concepts were correct. Specific challenges in translation included issues surrounding \\"word for word\\" translation requirements and the difficulty in choosing translations for Western Christian words that did not exist in Thai such as \\"priesthood\\". After reviewing and revising, the Book of Mormon translation into Thai was complete in August 1975 and the first copies were printed in October 1976. A re-translation was completed in 2010. =Recent developments= In 1987, three more church buildings were dedicated in Bang Na, Thonburi, and Chiang Mai. After the repeal of the restrictive visa laws, missionary work increased throughout Thailand as more mission areas were opened. In 1993, more than four hundred baptisms were performed, resulting in four districts and twenty-five branches in Thailand. There were eleven chapels and more being constructed as church membership rose to six thousand. After Troy L. Corriveau became mission president, the Thailand Stake was organized on June 18, 1995 by Neal A. Maxwell, containing five wards, three branches, and 2,260 members.; Pornchai Juntratip became the first patriarch in Thailand. The Bangkok North Stake was created on June 15, 2014 by Gerrit W. Gong. In 2013, there were approximately 650 baptisms and by the middle of 2014, there were over 1,000 baptisms performed. During his global ministry tour, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Russell M. Nelson and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Jeffrey R. Holland, gathered with and spoke to church members in Thailand on April 20, 2018. Church leaders estimated that this was the largest gathering of Latter-day Saints in the history of Thailand. Obstacles to missionary work According to R. Lanier Britsch, Thai people are very devoted to their country, king, traditions, and religion, particularly Buddhism. According to the Government's National Statistics Office, Theravada Buddhism makes up about 94 percent of practiced religions in Thailand. Islam and Chinese religions make up the second and third most practiced religions in Thailand. Despite the fact that Roman Catholics have proselyted in Thailand for 400 years and Protestants have proselyted for 160 years, Christianity makes up less than one percent of the practiced religions in Thailand. Although the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not recognized by the Thai government as an official religion, practice is allowed freely. According to historian Spencer J. Palmer, Thai people are exceptionally tolerant of religion, to the point where it is difficult to perform successful missionary work, because it is challenging to impose just one set of beliefs upon the people. Furthermore, religion and country are intricately and closely related in a way that becoming anti-Buddhist means becoming anti-Thai in many cases. Thus, few are willing to give up their country, family and traditions to convert other religions including Christianity. Despite the usual language and cultural barriers that pose challenges to Christian missionary work in Asian countries, there is a specific lack of success in Thailand as compared to other Asian countries even ones in where they are predominantly Buddhist. According to Erik Cohen, there are three reasons why Christian converts are difficult to find in Thailand. Firstly, there are fundamental differences in the views of Christianity and of Buddhism. Second, Buddhism permeates almost every aspect of life in Thailand and the individual identity of a Thai person. Finally, the attitudes of Catholic and Protestant missionaries in the earlier history of Thailand were often judgmental and inflexible. In 1972, a group of missionaries traveled to Sukhothai, the ancient capital of Thailand. One of the missionaries climbed on an ancient Buddha relic, sitting on its shoulders and had his photo taken by another missionary. A photo shop employee noticed the photo and sent it to the Siam Rath on July 9, 1972. Other newspapers included the image, causing it to spread. The Thai people felt that the elders disrespected Buddhism and Thailand. Thai Christians separated themselves from the Latter-day Saint Church, some writing articles against the LDS Church. The missionaries were arrested on July 12, 1972 and were found guilty of desecrating a Buddhist image and insulting the Buddhist religion. They were sentenced to a maximum six months in jail, for which they served the full- time. After their release, they were deported from Thailand. This event was widely publicized. Due to this event, Nakhon Sawan was closed as a missionary area and baptisms dropped throughout Thailand. In 1972, relations with the immigration office in Thailand became challenging. For a period of 20 years, missionaries in Thailand were limited to less than 100. In 1985, a new law mandated that missionaries leave Thailand every 90 days to renew their visas. In September 1992, the law that required missionaries to constantly renew their visas was reversed, only requiring one renewal for the 2-year stay. After Anand Panyarachun was reinstated as Prime Minister of Thailand, Anand created a new visa category allowing missionaries to stay in Thailand for the two-year mission and only required them to renew their visas one time during their time in Thailand. The last visa renewal trip to Malaysia was in August 1992. The coup d'√©tats of Thailand in 1991 and 1992 initiated violent demonstrations in Thai cities. Missionaries were told to stay away from demonstration areas. Larry R. White, the mission president at the time, warned missionaries to stay in their apartments; he also canceled a scheduled district meeting in Khon Kaen. Statistics and other information As of 2018, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported 22,100 members, 1 mission, 4 family history centers, 41 congregations, and 4 stakes in Thailand. =Missions= As of 2018, the only mission in Thailand is the Thailand Bangkok Mission. =Temples= The intention to build the first temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Thailand was announced by Thomas S. Monson on April 5, 2015 during the Church's general conference. Currently, the closet temple to the church members in Thailand is 1,000 miles away in Hong Kong. According to the artistic rendering, the temple will be 44,405 square feet and six stories. The temple is expected to be constructed in three to four years. } See also *Christianity in Thailand References Bibliography   Further reading * External links * :The official Thai website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints * Thailand Mormon Newsroom :Church news publication in Thailand ","title":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Thailand"},{"id":"43406458","text":"Los Molinos is a Chilean village and harbour in the commune of Valdivia in Valdivia Province, Los R√≠os Region.

History  Solca was one of the oldest villages in Cieszyn Silesia. A document of Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw issued on 23 May 1223 for Norbertine Sisters in Rybnik includes a following excerpt:I. Panic, 2010, p. 387 Except for Sale all the mentioned villages were lying in the vicinity of Rybnik, thus it is problematic to localise where the settlement was supposed to be. Some historians identify it with Solca. The village had already a church (ecclesia), undoubtedly one of the oldest in the region, perhaps built during the reign of Mieszko I Tanglefoot.I. Panic, 2010, p. 388 Again the village was mentioned in 1229 in the document of Pope Gregory IX issued for Benedictine abbey in Tyniec as Sal, leaving no doubts to its localisation close to Orlov√°.I. Panic, 2010, pp. 286, 388 The village with an inn was endowed to Orlov√° abbey founded in 1268, and attested in the associated document again as Sal.I. Panic, 2010, pp. 429-430 In the next centuries the name of the village evolved into Solec/Solca. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz and Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Teschen, and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Before the end of Middle Ages ownership of the village had changed, first it became a propriety of the Cieszyn dukes, then of noble families.I. Panic, 2010, p. 432 In 1570 it belonged to Jerzy Larisch from Lhota, the owner of Karvin√°. The Larisch family gradually enlarged their belongings, since 1730 administered as fideikomis. After the discovery of black coal in Karvin√° in 1776, many miners and workers came and settled there. The village developed quickly since then. In 1873 a ch√¢teau was built there by the Larisch family. In the surrounding park, the family chapel and tomb were built. In 1894-1897 a Neo-Renaissance Saint Henry church was constructed. The Viennese architect Cerny, inspired by the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, planned the church for the growing community and the new building was able to house 4,000 worshippers. According to the Austrian census of 1910 the village had 1,047 inhabitants, 1,021 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language, 819 (80.2%) were Polish-speaking and 165 (16.1%) were German-speaking. The most populous religious group were Roman Catholics with 930 (88.8%) followed by Protestants with 109 (10.4%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31.

After the World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and division of Cieszyn Silesia, Solca contained within Karvin√° became a part of Czechoslovakia. In October 1938 as a part of Zaolzie it was annexed by Poland. After German invasion of Poland in 1939, the area became a part of Nazi Germany until 1945. After the war, the 1920 borders were restored. Solca virtually disappeared, when the population moved to nearby towns and villages in the 1950s and 1960s, as Solca was extensively undermined due to the coal mining in the area. Communist authorities destroyed most of the buildings afterwards. The ch√¢teau was demolished in 1953, the church in 1960, the Larisch-M√∂nnich family tomb in 1985.

Humans and animals regularly adjust to their environment. For example, when they are stimulated by their physiological state to seek food, they eat (if possible) to reduce their hunger and thus adjust to the hunger stimulus. Adjustment disorder occurs when there is an inability to make a normal adjustment to some need or stress in the environment. Successful adjustment is crucial to having a high quality of life. Those who are unable to adjust well are more likely to have clinical anxiety or depression, as well as experience feelings of hopelessness, Anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, sleeping problems and reckless behavior. When evaluating adjustment it can be considered in two ways: adjustment as an achievement and adjustment as a process.  Adjustment as an achievement  This model addresses adjustment at a specific moment in time, considering an individual's adjustment to one challenge, not to all challenges they have faced. Successfully adjusting to one scenario can be independent of struggling to adjust to another, unrelated scenario. An example of this type of approach is observing a poor student beginning to study during recess because they don't have a home environment where they can effectively study. Beginning to study at another time would be considered adequately adjusting to this scenario, but does not consider the other ways it may impact their life (i.e.: inhibiting social interactions with peers.)  Adjustment as a process  The 'adjustment as a process' theory portrays that, since the moment we are born, humans are in a constant state of adjustment. Since we exist in a state of constant, oftentimes rapid change, it follows that we cannot break these changes down into separate, unrelated challenges. This method of consideration asserts there is no way to 'adjust successfully', because something will always be about to change and prompt further adjustment. This approach views all life events as inextricable from some form of adjustment.  Successful Adjustment  Successful Adjustment is also called being 'well adjusted' and is critical to mental health. Colloquially, being well-adjusted is defined as a person who \\"is reasonable and has good judgement...their behavior is not difficult or strange.\\" It is important to remember that adjustment is a continuum, not a simple dichotomy; people can fluctuate and be adept at adjusting in different circumstances. In general, a person that is well-adjusted will have the following characteristics: * An understanding of personal strengths and weaknesses and a tendency to play up strengths while limiting the appearance of weaknesses * Personal respect and appreciation, a well-adjusted individual finds themselves to be inherently valuable * Appropriate aspirations that require hard work and capitalizing on strengths without being too far out of reach and setting them up for failure * Basic needs such as food, water, shelter, and sleep are consistently met, as well as a general feeling of security and positive self-esteem * Positive attitude and a tendency to find the goodness in other people, objects and activities. A well-adjusted person will acknowledge others' weaknesses but not actively search for faults. * Flexibility to respond to and accommodate for changes in the environment * Ability to handle adverse circumstances: well- adjusted people are able to take negative life events in stride, they will be motivated to take action to remedy the problem rather than passively accept it * A realistic perception of the world that allows for a healthy amount of distrust of others and encourages pragmatic thinking * A feeling of ease within surrounding environments. A well-adjusted person feels comfortable in different aspects of their community such as home, school, work, neighborhood, religious organization, etc. * A balanced life philosophy that accounts for and acknowledges the impact that the world has on an individual, as well as the impact an individual can have on the world These more detailed characteristics listed above can be synthesized into these main criteria: * ability to adequately function * ability to perform adaptive tasks * high positive affect and low negative affect * general satisfaction in various life domains * absence of debilitating psychological disorders An individual that doesn't have these characteristics or is not consistently meeting the listed criteria could be diagnosed with an Adjustment disorder. If diagnosed, they would likely be treated with psychotherapy to help them develop these skills and abilities. Ways to encourage these healthy adjustment mechanisms may include: * encouraging talking about and processing emotions * understanding and offering support, especially during periods of transition * reassuring them that they are normal and worthy of inclusion * monitoring progress in different environments (i.e.: home and school) * emphasizing decision making, especially starting out with simple, relatively inconsequential decisions (i.e.: what to eat for breakfast, what toy to play with) * promoting participation in hobbies and activities that are enjoyable and play to their individual strengths  Examples of Adjustment Methods  Many methods used for adjustment are also defense mechanisms. Defense mechanisms can be either adaptive or maladaptive depending on the context and the use. In a 2003 study, researchers found that elementary school children that utilized appropriate defense mechanisms had higher performance in academic, social, conduct, and athletic domains. = Day Dreaming = * Daydreams are brief detachments from reality while awake. Episodes generally include fantasizing about hopes for the future and other pleasant thoughts. * Adaptive example: daydreaming about positive social interactions could reduce social anxiety * In a 2016 study, researchers studied 103 students as they transitioned to university. They found that those who day dreamed more frequently and whose day dreams had higher rates of positive characteristics and positive emotional outcomes were less likely to feel lonely by the end of the study. Participants' day dreams fostered feelings of connection and social inclusion during an anxiety ridden period. Findings from this study suggest that day dreaming can help individuals with socio-emotional adjustment. = Additional Examples = * Compensation: emphasizing a strength to diminish the appearance of a real or imagined weakness ** Adaptive example: developing strong interpersonal skills to compensate for difficulty with academics * Intellectualization: focusing on the abstract side of something as opposed to the practical or emotional sides ** Adaptive example: researching a disease after being diagnosed rather than contemplating the life changing impact * Rationalization: understanding the reasoning behind actions; often touted as \\"making excuses\\" but can be adaptive ** Adaptive example: knowing that you need to be stern and harsh to a friend in order to tell them the truth and help them improve * Identification: associating oneself with another individual (often a friend or relative) that is extremely accomplished ** Adaptive example: associating with the success of sibling when you have helped them achieve a goal * Projection: displacing personal feelings/opinions as those of another person (consciously or unconsciously) ** Adaptive example: mitigating personal guilt by saying a friend has anger issues rather than acknowledging your internal anger  See also  * Psychological adaptation * Emotional well-being  References  Category:Behavioral concepts ","title":"Adjustment (psychology)"},{"id":"43406754","text":"Clover Downtown Historic District is a national historic district located at Clover, York County, South Carolina.

History  In the early 1900s, a moose cow (adult female) died, leaving her year-old calf behind. Different sources claim the cow was a killed by a passing train, others that it drowned, but they agree it happened near the Dal√§lven river close to √Ñlvkarleby in Uppland. Its live female calf was taken to Johan Blad, the foreman at √Ñlvkarle√∂'s railway park. Blad knew a lineman called Anders Gustav Jansson who lived in √Ñlvkarleby and had a reputation for animal husbandry, so he asked for his help with the moose which they named Stolta. Stolta was raised like a tame horse; doing forestry work, pulling carts and sleds with material, and also used to pull a sled carrying tourists between the railway station and the tourist hotel near the waterfall in √Ñlvkarleby. In 1907, at a winter sports festival in Falun, Stolta won a trot race against trained trotting horses over an ice-covered lake. Jansson was afterwards presented with a coffee service: a coffee pot and accompanying sugar bowl and coffee creamer. The coffee pot had an inscription that read Minne av Vinteridrottsf√§sten i Falun 1907 f√∂r k√∂rning av elg (\\"Memento of Winter Sports Festival in Falun in 1907 for driving with a moose\\"). The park where √Ñlgen Stolta was kept closed in 1909 as the area was marked as part of the reservoir for a hydroelectric power station. Stolta was moved to the open- air museum of Skansen on the island of Djurg√•rden in Stockholm where it was thought she could be better cared for, and her name was changed to \\"Lotta.\\" After the 1907 race, a rule prohibiting the use of moose as draft animals was added.

In County Dublin the equivalent unit was termed a serjeanty, while in County Meath and environs it was a barony. The area of a cantred usually corresponded to that of an earlier tr√≠cha c√©t of Gaelic Ireland, and sometimes to that of a rural deanery in the medieval Irish church. Paul Mac Cotter has \\"demonstrated the existence of 151 certain cantreds and indicated the probable existence of a further 34.\\" Cantreds were replaced by baronies from the sixteenth century. Functions In the Anglo-Norman shires and liberties, the cantred was originally a unit of subinfeudation; a magnate or tenant-in-chief who received a grant from the King of England as Lord of Ireland would typically grant a cantred or half- cantred to a baron as mesne lord, who would hold the chief manor and grant sub-manors to his tenants. Church land within a cantred was excluded from grants. Unlike a knight's fee, there was no military service in the feudal duties of a cantred. The cantred was used for administrative purposes, with the serjeanty for law enforcement, the eyre for law courts, and collection of scutage and other taxes organised by cantred. Supersession Cantreds declined in the fourteenth century as Ango-Norman power retreated to the Pale. They had fallen into disuse by the sixteenth-century Tudor reconquest of Ireland, when the barony became the subunit of the county. In the east and south, baronies often had the names of older cantreds, though the boundaries often diverged. In the west and north, the new baronies generally had the extent of a former tr√≠cha c√©t, but a different name.

University of Puerto Rico Catalogue of the Reduviidae of the World. Special Edition of the Caribbean Journal of Science, 1990 is a genus in the family Reduviidae, the assassin bugs. Members of the genus have been unofficially assigned the common name Grass Assassin bugs, but generally this name remains meaningful only to naturalists, because these insects have been too well camouflaged to raise robust public awareness. Description Lopodytes species are small-to- medium-sized bugs, measuring between 10 and 20 mm in length. They are however very gracile and elongate in build, with nearly parallel sides, so they are far less massive than most insects of a similar bodily length. Usually they occur in savanna grass and similar vegetation, but on a level surface they generally adopt a very horizontal posture that emphasizes their resemblance to the thread assassins, the Emesinae. They easily may be confused with the Emesinae, but they are somewhat less gracile, typically 50% to 100% larger in linear measurement, and unlike the Emesinae, they do not have raptorial front legs. In color Lopodytes species generally are a range of dusty greyish yellows to browns, shades that combine with their shape to make them inconspicuous in the partly dried tussock grasses that they normally inhabit. They probably are noticed far less often in the field than when they come to lights at night in certain seasons. Etymology The name Lopodytes could well be a source of confusion. It might refer to the Ancient Greek root ŒªŒøœÄŒøœÇ, meaning bark or covering, plus Œ¥œÖœÑŒ∑œÇ, a diver, suggesting a creature that hides under coverings, but it might more likely derive from ŒªŒøœÄŒøŒ¥œÖœÑŒ±œÑ, an old word for a robber that stripped the clothing off victims. Furthermore, there is a genus of ducks, Lophodytes which is sufficiently similar in spelling to cause either confusion in reference or errors in typing. Biology The biology of Lopodytes species has not been much studied. They appear to be predators of small insects, typical of Reduviid specialised for life in tussock grasses in savanna-like areas. As a rule both sexes are winged, but wingless forms occur. They have been reported to come to lights, but only occasionally. In those species for which observations have been recorded, the eggs are very elongate and are laid on grass stems either singly or in small clusters.Miller, N. C. E. Notes on the biology of the Reduviidae of Southern Rhodesia. Trans. zool. Soc. Lond. 27: 541-654.1953 Taxonomy and distribution The genus Lopodytes is in the order Hemiptera, suborder Heteroptera, family Reduviidae, subfamily Harpactorinae. Some sources give the genus authority as Rondani, 1867, but others credit St√•l, 1853, Ofv. Vet.-Ak. Fork. 10, p. 263.

Featuring a young boy from an Irish Catholic neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1947, the film follows the unlikely friendship that evolves between 11-year-old Michael and a Czechoslovakian Rabbi that stirs up the wrath of a local Irish gang from Michael's neighborhood. After a tragic turn of events, Michael seeks the help of an ancient Jewish text to summon a protector in his time of need. The film is a made-for-television movie that was distributed by Showtime Networks in 2001, and later released on DVD in 2003. Plot In Brooklyn in the summer of 1947, 11-year-old Michael Devlin (Peter Tambakis) witnesses a brutal beating of a Jewish shopkeeper by a local Irish street gang called the Falcons. Scared to go to the police, Michael tells his widowed mother (Lolita Davidovich) who only consoles him by telling him God will judge the guilty. With a heavy feeling of guilt still following the young boy, Michael reaches out to Rabbi Judah Hirsch (Stephen Rea) who had fled Czechoslovakia during World War II. An unlikely friendship evolves between the two characters as they bond over baseball and alluring tales of Jewish folklore like the book of Kabbalah which has the power to create miracles such as snow in August. As a fatherless child, Michael eventually grows to see the Rabbi as close friend and father figure‚Äîa relationship that ends up costing him his friends and brings unwanted attention from Frankie McMarthy (Adam MacDonald ) and the rest of the Falcon gang. The Falcons attack Rabbi Hirsch and later threaten Michael and his mother, demonstrating their outright disapproval of the relationship between a Jewish Rabbi and a Catholic family. Determined to finally have the courage to stand up against the gang, Michael goes to Rabbi Hirsch in the hospital to learn more about an ancient Jewish text and the ritual for summoning the Golem to help him serve justice and protect his loved ones. Cast * Peter Tambakis as Michael Devlin * Stephen Rea as Rabbi Judah Hirsch * Lolita Davidovich as Kate Devlin * Adam MacDonald as Frankie McCarthy Reception The television film does not yet have a rating from major film critics, but it received a rating of 100 percent by audience reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes. New York Daily News reporter Eric Mink noted that while the film includes harsh language and violent fight scenes, it is a fine film for all ages that is an \\"ambitious mixture of dramatic realism, morality tale and mystical fable.\\" Terry Kelleher of People magazine said the film including a good cast and a heart warming set of values. The film received three Emmy nominations including Outstanding Direction in a Children's Special for Richard Friedenberg and Outstanding Performer in a Children's Special for Stephen Rea. Finally, the film was nominated for Outstanding Children's Special in which all the producers were credited including producers Jake Eberts, Lenny Young, Daniel Ostroff, Nancy Cooperstein, and Tani Cohen.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Governor Meshech Weare House stands in the town center of Hampton Falls, on the north side of Exeter Road at its junction with Lincoln Avenue. It is just west of the First Baptist Church, and across the street from a public school. To its west is a small park named in Weare's honor. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, and is of wood frame construction with a side gable roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature and full segmented-arch pediment. The interior of the building is a combination of old and modern elements, including some period paneling. The house has ells extending to the rear, which are 20th century work done to replace others destroyed in fires. After a 1957 fire the rear of the main block was extended, increasing the size of the rooms there. The house was built in 1723, and was for many years home to Meshech Weare. Weare (1713-1786) was educated at Harvard, and was primarily a farmer until the time of the American Revolution. A reluctant supporter of independence, he chaired the state's executive committee during the American Revolutionary War, and became its first President in 1784 (the term Governor of New Hampshire was adopted later).

Magruder (1844 ‚Äì October 20, 1865) was a Confederate soldier and guerrilla during the American Civil War. Born in Bullitt County, Kentucky, he took part in several major Western theater battles, but he is best known for his fate as a guerrilla, and was possibly the inspiration of a fictional local folk hero and guerilla fighter, Sue Munday, whose exploits closely mirrored his own. Army career Magruder enlisted in the Confederate States Army at age 17 and served under General Simon Bolivar Buckner at the Battle of Fort Donelson. He was captured when Buckner chose to surrender the fort rather than allow his men to fight their way out, but he soon escaped. Magruder joined the personal bodyguard of Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston, serving under him at the Battle of Shiloh. Following General Johnston's death, Magruder transferred to General John Hunt Morgan's Kentucky Cavalry. He took part in Morgan's raid into Ohio and Indiana; and once again escaped capture. He was eventually able to cross the Ohio River back into Kentucky. Guerilla fighter Magruder, now well behind Union lines, located other escaped Confederates and led them in raids against Union military targets south of Louisville. As historian Walter L. Hixson notes, \\"Magruder also plundered Union homes, burned alive an African-American man, and violated southern gender codes by raping the wife of a Union soldier and six other 'young ladies' at a school.\\" Margruder's small band was ambushed by pro-Union home guards, and most of the gang of guerrillas were captured and arrested after robbing a bank in February 1865. Magruder and two others avoided capture for a number of weeks, but the three were eventually cornered in a barn and forced to surrender. Magruder had been seriously wounded, having been shot in the arm and back, and then he was shot in the lungs during capture. One of the men captured with Magruder was Marcellus Jerome Clarke. Clarke was quickly charged with being a guerilla, convicted by a closed military tribunal, and hanged in March 1865. Magruder, however, was allowed to recover his health in jail before he was arraigned.Henry Magruder, Three Years In The Saddle: The Life and Confession of Henry Magruder: The Original Sue Munday, The Scourge of Kentucky, (published by his captor, Major Cyrus J.

Prentice had written a series of articles about the area's ongoing guerrilla terrorism in his Louisville Journal, but attributed it to activities of a \\"Sue Mundy.\\" These tales closely paralleled Clarke's and Magruder's activities. By some accounts, including his own, Magruder was the original inspiration for the fictitious Confederate guerilla fighter. Magruder made the claim in his posthumous memoir, Three Years in the Saddle: The Life and Confession of Henry Magruder: The Original Sue Munday, The Scourge of Kentucky (1865).

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 25, 2015. The title is an adaptation of the movie The Man Who Fell to Earth starring David Bowie as an extraterrestrial genius. Plot Elon Musk lands with his Dragon 2 spacecraft into the Simpsons' backyard. While eating dinner with them, Marge asks why Musk is in Springfield. He responds by revealing that the purpose for his stay in Springfield is that he is looking for inspiration. To this, Homer invites him to tag along with him to the power plant. The next day, during the car ride to the power plant, Elon discovers that Homer is the source of new ideas for inventions, as his \\"Homerisms\\" (according to Lisa) quickly inspire him. At the power plant, Elon inspires Mr. Burns to install a magnetohydrodynamic generator to the plant, through a suggestion. Burns meets Musk directly, and attempts to hire him, but Elon rejects the offer as he does not care about the money (much to Burns' surprise). Musk and Burns announce to the town that the power plant has devised new plans for the town's electrical needs (such as Willie spinning a wheel, the Springfield Hyperloop, and Musk's latest project, the Glayvinator). Despite the town's cheer to this, Smithers remains suspicious about Elon Musk. It is also announced that Elon invented a brand of self-driving vehicles for Springfield. Bart sneaks into his family's car to disable the auto-drive mode, requiring Musk's master password. He and Lisa go for a joyride in the car, where they land at the power plant, where there is another announcement by Musk. Musk reveals that the town is currently losing roughly $50 million a quarter, much to Burns' horror. Musk explains to Burns that the true intention was to save the Earth. Thanks to Musk, Burns announces to his employees that there will be massive layoffs. Burns then apologizes to an injured Smithers for getting the hounds to attack him (rather than apologize for not believing Smithers in his true suspicion of Musk), and reveals his plot to kill him. Homer, however, is upset, because his ex-friend Musk caused the whole escapade that led to Burns unemploying Lenny, Carl, and the other power plant employees (rather than the fact that his friends are unemployed and it is kind of his fault). Marge advises him to break up with Musk gently. The next day, while Elon is discussing his ideas for inventions with Homer, Burns attempts to assassinate him. Though the bullet accidentally aims in Homer's way, Musk saves him. Homer gratefully thanks him, but he admits to Musk that he wants to break up with him as best friends. To this, the two share one last hug and one last Homer-inspiration: he tells Musk that the little dolphin on the helmet of the Miami Dolphins is also wearing a helmet (although this was no longer accurate by the time this episode aired, since the team replaced that logo design before the 2013 season). The Simpson family say goodbye to Musk, as he boards his rocket to space. He returns to return Lisa, who attempted to stowaway into the rocket. To make up for Lisa's sadness, he gives the family a futuristic birdhouse (similar to the birdhouse from the start of the episode). Elon then departs, and states there are some things he will miss‚Äîsuch as Homer's last thoughts to him‚Äîas he drifts through the quiet, still blackness of outer space. Production The episode was written by Neil Campbell, a freelance writer. It guest stars Elon Musk as himself. Executive producer Al Jean stated they tried to make the episode not a \\"kiss-ass\\" guest star turn, and the episode contains many jabs at Musk's perceived egotism. Musk was a fan of the series, having watched the show since attending university. He guest starred on the show because he and executive producer James L. Brooks had a meeting, after which Brooks was convinced he wanted a fictional version of Musk on the show. The closing theme is David Bowie's Starman, later associated with Musk's Falcon Heavy launch in 2018. Reception The episode received an audience of 3.29 million, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"\\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth‚Äô plays out more like a love letter to Musk than a proper Simpsons episode. It's like some Simpsons writers met Musk at a TED talk, got smitten when they found out Musk was a fan, and turned an episode of the show over to him. Which would be less of a problem if the episode were well- thought-out and funny, Musk were an engaging comic presence, or the Simpsons themselves weren't relegated to supporting status on their own show.\\" References  External links   \\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\\" at theSimpsons.com Category:2015 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 26) episodes Category:Elon Musk ","title":"The Musk Who Fell to Earth"},{"id":"43407201","text":"is a 2014 Japanese drama film directed by Shinya Tsukamoto.

Premier Guitar, West Warren, January 21, 2014. The pedals were made manually by Finnegan. The Centaur is characterized as a \\"transparent\\" overdrive, meaning it adds gain to the signal without significantly altering the tone of the guitar. About 8,000 units were built between 1994 and 2000. Guitarists praised the clear, uncolored tone of the boosted signal. \\"Best Effects Pedals 2014: SonicState Gear Of The Year Awards\\". Amped 30-Dec-14 The circuit had unique characteristics, most noticeably the use of an IC MAX1044 voltage converter. The voltage converter drives 18 volts to the operational amplifier which is the core of the circuit; at this voltage the response of the amplifier is different from at 9 volt, since its slew rate depends on the voltage supply.http://hyperphysics.phy- astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electronic/a741p3.html Op Amp Slew Rate: Tutorial; Formula; Calculator The higher the voltage supply, the higher the order of harmonics the operational amplifier will generate, and the more \\"metallic\\" the sound.http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa011/sloa011.pdfIs it good to have a higher slew rate? What are some of the effects due to slew rate limitations?Eric Jacobs (guitar amplifier designer) personal communication https://www.jakeamps.com.ar/ Depending on the settings of the control knobs, the pedal can act mostly as a clean boost, adding mostly volume and minimal coloring to the sound. This can be used to drive the input valve stage of the amplifier to use the characteristic distortion sound of an overdriven guitar amp. Alternatively (or additionally) the controls can be set to distort the sound signal in the pedal, where two germanium diodes can perform waveform clipping (see clipping (audio)). The \\"gain\\" knob is a double potentiometer (a \\"dual-ganged gain pot\\"), which controls bass and middle frequencies. Other knobs are treble and volume. The circuit boards of Centaurs are notably \\"gooped\\", or covered with black epoxy resin in order to make it harder for imitators to replicate it. After manufacture was discontinued, original units have been spotted exceeding $5000.00 USD and were considered rare collector's items. A number of pedal manufacturers have since come out with much more affordable products, some of which come very close to the characteristics of the Centaur. Still, the original Centaur is often used as a standard to compare new overdrive pedal designs.\\"Tone Bakery Creme Brulee Review\\". Premier Guitar, Charles Saufley, February 05, 2015\\"J Rockett Archer review\\". Music Radar. In 2014, Finnegan sold the same effect under the name \\"KTR\\". The KTR features the same circuit as the original pedal, with the same germanium diodes at the heart of the sound-shaping circuit, but uses surface-mount technology, making the pedal compatible with mass production and smaller in size. Screen printed on the front of the KTR are the words \\"kindly remember that the ridiculous hype that offends so many is not of my making\\", in response to the cult following garnered by the original Centaur.

He ruled during the Late Classic Period, from 781 to roughly 808 AD. Possibly a descendant of Itzam K ºan Ahk II, K ºinich Yat Ahk II ascended the throne upon the death of his brother, the sixth ajaw of the site, Ha º K ºin Xook. While K ºinich Yat Ahk II presided over the destruction of the rival Maya site Pomona, his reign likely ended with K ºinich Tatbu Skull IV of Yaxchilan capturing and subjugating Piedras Negras. Itzam K ºan Ahk II left behind several monuments, including stelae at Piedras Negras, a stone seat known as Throne 1 which records either the death or abdication of Ha º K ºin Xook, and Panel 3 which recounts the exploits of Itzam K ºan Ahk II. Biography =Reign of Piedras Negras= K ºinich Yat Ahk II is known to have engaged in two wars against the Maya polity Pomona (pictured). Likely the final ajaw of Piedras Negras, K ºinich Yat Ahk II (also known as Ruler 7) was the son of Lady Bird, and was born on April 7, 750 AD (9.15.18.16.7 12 Manki º 5 Sotz º in the Long Count).Martin & Grube (2000), pp. 152‚Äì153. It is possible that he was the son of Itzam K ºan Ahk II, or perhaps T ºul Chiik, a prince of Piedras Negras.Zender, \\"Piedras Negras Ruler 7\\", (n.d.). The ruler's name is a combination of two elements: a title and a predecessor's name. The title, k ºinich, translates to \\"red-faced\\", and is a reference to the settlement's rulers' belief that they were the \\"lords of the sun\\". The name portion, Yat Ahk, was not taken from one of K ºinich Yat Ahk II's immediate predecessors, but rather from one of Piedras Negras's earliest rulers, Yat Ahk I.O'Neil (2014), p. 147.O'Neil (2014), p. 9. K ºinich Yat Ahk II took up the throne at Piedras Negras on May 31, 781 (9.17.10.9.4 1 K ºan 7 Yaxk ºin), almost a year following the death of his brother, Ha º K ºin Xook. Despite this lengthy gap, there is no evidence that anyone ruled Piedras Negras in the interim. =Acts of aggression= K ºinich Yat Ahk II first took military action against his opponents in August of 787 AD, capturing a yajaw k ºahk (a \\"lord of fire\\") from Santa Elena Poco Uinic. Then, in both 792 and 794 AD, K ºinich Yat Ahk II carried out two \\"star wars\\" (that is, wars planned to coincide with key astronomical events) against the rival Maya settlement Pomona, the latter of the two resulting in Pomona being decisively defeated and subordinated. K ºinich Yat Ahk II was aided in both of these wars by his ally, Parrot Chaak of La Mar.Zender, \\"Pomona\\", (n.d.). =Capture= In AD 808, Piedras Negras's sworn enemy Yaxchilan, ruled by K ºinich Tatbu Skull IV, conquered Piedras Negras and subjugated K ºinich Yat Ahk II, ending his rule; Lintel 10 at Yaxchilan directly names K ºinich Yat Ahk II as a captive of the Yaxchilan ajaw. There is evidence that troops from Yaxchilan attacked Piedras Negras and razed it, as debris and burnt artifacts have been documented throughout the site, and it appeared that Throne 1 was deliberately dismantled. In the 1930s, certain researchers argued that this evidence suggested that the ruling class had been overthrown in a \\"peasants revolt\\" but modern scholars largely reject this idea. Regardless, Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube, and Mayanist Stephen D. Houston argue that the Piedras Negras dynasty may have survived for a time after the capture and death of K ºinich Yat Ahk II, but its power was severely curtailed and fizzled out around 810 AD. Afterwards, Piedras Negras declined in importance and was eventually abandoned to the jungles of Guatemala.Houston et al. (1999), pp. 817. Monuments =Stelae= Several stelae have been found that were erected by K ºinich Yat Ahk II, including Stelae 12 and 15, which were sculpted out of limestone. The first to be raised was Stela 15, which celebrated K ºinich Yat Ahk II's first hotun ending as ajaw of Piedras Negras. The monument, positioned on the upper terrace of Pyramid O-13, is \\"innovative\\", because it is almost a three- dimensional depiction of the leader. This innovation was the result of Piedras Negras sculptors fine-tuning their technical skills and marked \\"the closest [the sculptors of Piedras Negras] came to releasing the body from the stone block\\", according to O'Neil.O'Neil (2014), pp. 87‚Äì88. The monument bears some stylistic similarities to Ha º K ºin Xook's Stela 13, and given that Stela 15 is positioned above Stela 13 on the northwestern side of Pyramid O-13, it was likely that Stela 15 was erected to purposely associate K ºinich Yat Ahk II with Ha º K ºin Xook.O'Neil (2014), p. 142. Stela 12 details K ºinich Yat Ahk II's victory over Pomona. The final stela to be erected was Stela 12 and details K ºinich Yat Ahk II's aforementioned victory over Pomona, showing K ºInich Yat Ahk II above military leaders and captives (of which a few are named). Stylistically, the stela is more reminiscent of panels found at Piedras Negras, due to its \\"shallow relief[s]\\". According to O'Neil, this style is evidence that at this time, \\"the sculptors ‚Ä¶ favored multi-figural pictorial narrative over the divine ruler's singular embodiment or three- dimensional presence.\\"O'Neil (2014), p. 145. Houston et al. argue that this stela is a \\"monument of vengeance\\", redressing the defeat of Piedras Negras at the hands of Pomona in 554 AD.Houston et al. (2000), pp. 97110. While the monument is not a niche stela, it makes reference to the style by showing the \\"seated ruler at the top ... and other people at lower levels\\", similar to Stelae 14 and 33. The stela faces southwest, but this is because the monument was installed on the O-13 pyramid, which already faced in this direction. O'Neil has proposed, however, that the orientation was also purposeful, and that K ºinich Yat Ahk II was trying to connect his stela with those of his forefathers. Stela 12 is in a relatively poor state of preservation, as exposure has weathered it down. According to O'Neil, Stelae 15 and 12 show two different versions of what it means to be a \\"proper ruler\\": Stela 15 depicts K ºinich Yat Ahk II as a devout practitioner of religion who does his sacred duty. Stela 12, on the other hand, depicts the ajaw as a conqueror, defeating enemies and subjugating rivals. In addition, both Stelae 15 and 12 include the names of several sculptors and artists, one of whom worked on both stelae. These names are difficult to translate because many are unique when compared to extant Mayan glyphic texts.Nelson (2005), 171186. =Throne 1= 250px K ºinich Yat Ahk II likely commissioned the construction of Throne 1, which details either the death or abdication of Ha º K ºin Xook. The entire throne is covered in images and glyphs, with a prominent zoomorphic face featured on the back.O'Neil (2014), p. 19. Discovered in a special recess in J-6 (a gallery wing of the main Piedras Negras palace acropolis), the throne was in pieces, but has since been reconstructed.Pitts (2011), pp. 162170. J. Eric S. Thompson proposed three hypotheses to explain its destruction: it had been destroyed in a peasant revolt, it was smashed by conquerors from Yaxchilan, or its destruction \\"was more recent and is attributable to superstitious fear\\".O'Neil (2014), p. 49. =Panel 3= K ºinich Yat Ahk II also commissioned the carving of Panel 3, which was placed on the O-13 Pyramid. The panel is both an intricate narrative of daily life in the palace, as well as a documentation of a 749 AD K ºatun celebration thrown by the previous ruler Itzam K ºan Ahk II. According to the artifact, the celebration was attended by many dignitaries, including a b ºaah sajal (\\"first ruler\\") named K ºan Mo º Te º who had served K ºinich Yo ºnal Ahk II, as well as the interim ruler of Yaxchilan, Yopaat Bahlam II. When Panel 3 was erected, Piedras Negras had begun to decline in importance. Thus, K ºinich Yat Ahk II likely erected it recall the time when Piedras Negras held supremacy over the region.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 149.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 153. To this day, many archaeologists and Mayanists consider Panel 3 to be a \\"masterpiece of Maya art\\" due to its elucidating the life of Itzam K ºan Ahk II and his servants, as well as providing information regarding rare grammatical structures in the Mayan glyphs.Pitts (2011), pp. 129145.

The treasure ships had an enormous cargo of various products.. Admiral Zheng returned to China with many kinds of tribute goods, such as silver, spices, sandalwood, precious stones, ivory, ebony, camphor, tin, deer hides, coral, kingfisher feathers, tortoise shells, gums and resin, rhinoceros horn, sapanwood and safflower (for dyes and drugs), Indian cotton cloth, and ambergris (for perfume). They even brought back exotic animals, such as ostriches, elephants, and giraffes. The imports from the voyages provided the large quantities of economic goods that fueled China's own industries.. There was so much cobalt oxide from Persia that the porcelain center Jingdezhen had a plentiful supply for decades after the voyages. The fleet also returned with such a large amount of black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity in Chinese society. There were sometimes so many Chinese goods unloaded into an Indian port that it could take months to price everything... The treasure voyages resulted in a flourishing Ming economy,Cited in . while boosting the lucrative maritime commerce to an all- time high.. The voyages also induced a sudden supply shock in the Eurasian market, where the Chinese maritime exploits in Asia led to disruptions of European imports with sudden price spikes in the early 15th century.. The commodities that the ships carried included three major categories: gifts to be bestowed on rulers, items for exchange of goods or payment of goods with fixed prices at low rates (e.g. gold, silver, copper coins, and paper money), and items in which China had the monopoly (e.g. musks, ceramics, and silks). However, the Ming trade enterprise also saw significant changes and developments in which the Chinese themselves began trading and supplying the commodities that were non-Chinese in origin and earlier entirely in the hands of the Indians, Arabs, and other foreigners. For instance, they shipped Southeast Asian sandalwood and Indian pepper to Aden and Dhofar, Indian putchuk and pepper to Hormuz, sandalwood and rice to Mogadishu, and iron cauldrons and pans to Mecca.. This highlighted the commercial character of the voyages, in which the Chinese further expanded upon the already large profits from their trade. The impact of the Ming expeditions on commerce was on multiple levels: it established imperial control over local private commercial networks, expanded tributary relations and thereby brought commerce under state supervision, established court-supervised transactions at foreign ports and thereby generate substantial revenue for both parties, and increased production and circulation of commodities across the region.. Imperial proclamations were issued to the foreign kings, which meant that they could either submit and be bestowed with rewards or refuse and be pacified under the threat of an overwhelming military force... Foreign kings had to reaffirm their recognition of the Chinese emperor's superior status by presenting tribute.. Many countries were enrolled as tributaries.. The treasure fleet conducted the transport of the many foreign envoys to China and back, but some envoys traveled independently.. Those rulers who submitted received political protection and material rewards.. During the Hongwu reign, the situation in the Malay-Indonesian world was viewed with a negative attitude.. However, the treasure fleet came to dominate the Malay-Indonesian sphere via Java, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. In Ceylon and southern India, the treasure fleet forced the political situation of the region into their favor, while making the maritime routes safe for commerce and diplomacy. Overview In Malacca, the Chinese actively sought to develop a commercial hub and a base of operation for the voyages into the Indian Ocean. Malacca had been a relatively insignificant region, not even qualifying as a polity prior to the voyages according to both Ma Huan and Fei Xin, and was a vassal region of Siam.. In 1405, the Ming court dispatched Zheng He with a stone tablet enfeoffing the Western Mountain of Malacca as well as an imperial order elevating the status of the port to a country. The Chinese also established a government depot (ÂÆòÂª†) as a fortified cantonment for their soldiers. It served as a storage facility as the fleet traveled and assembled from other destinations within the maritime region.. Ma Huan reports that Siam did not dare to invade Malacca thereafter. The rulers of Malacca, such as King Paramesvara in 1411, would pay tribute to the Chinese emperor in person. In 1431, when a Malaccan representative complained that Siam was obstructing tribute missions to the Ming court, the Xuande Emperor dispatched Zheng He carrying a threatening message for the Siamese king saying \\"You, king should respect my orders, develop good relations with your neighbours, examine and instruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or aggressively.\\" In 1404, the eunuch envoy Yin Qing was sent on a mission from Ming China to Malacca.. King Paramesvara of Malacca (r. 1399‚Äì1413), delighted by this, reciprocated with an envoy bearing tribute in local products. A year later during the first treasure voyage, Admiral Zheng He arrived at Malacca to formally confer Paramesvara's investiture as King of Malacca. Malacca's ruling house would be on friendly terms with Ming China and collaborate with the treasure fleet. The Ming recognition and alliance was a factor that ensured stability in Malacca.. Malacca prospered and gradually came to replace Palembang as the regional trading center. Tribute Giraffe with Attendant, depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys to the Ming court (Philadelphia Museum of Art) The Taizong Shilu entry of 12 August 1406 noted that Chen Zuyi and Liang Daoming sent envoys to the Ming court, possibly while Admiral Zheng He was commanding the treasure fleet through Indonesian waters to return home.. Chen Zuyi sent his son Chen Shiliang to the Ming court. Liang Daoming sent his nephew Liang Guanzheng, Xigandaliye, and Hajji Muhammad to the Ming court. The Ming court understood that Liang Daoming was the leader of the Chinese community at Palembang, but ranked Chen Zuyi above Liang as they saw Chen as the Chieftain () of Palembang, which was not an official Ming title. It is possible that Chen Zuyi had hoped for official recognition by the Ming court, but it never came to be. Admiral Zheng He was informed by Shi Jinqing about Chen Zuyi's piracy, causing Chen to be classified as a pirate in the eyes of the Chinese authorities.. During the first voyage, Admiral Zheng He established order in Palembang under Chinese rule.. The Ming court recognized Shi Jinqing as the Grand Chieftain () of Palembang after Admiral Zheng He had captured Chen Zuyi.. After Shi Jinqing's death, his daughter Shi Erjie became king (wang)‚Äîa title normally not held by women‚Äîrather than his son, a very uncommon situation for both the patriarchal Chinese and Muslims. On 27 February 1425, according to the Taizong Shilu, Admiral Zheng He was sent on a diplomatic mission to confer a gauze cap, a ceremonial robe (with floral gold woven into gold patterns in the silk), and a silver seal on Shi Jisun (Shi Jinqing's son), who had received the Yongle Emperor's approval to succeed his father's office of Pacification Commissioner.. The Taizong Shilu didn't define Palembang as a separate country on its own right.. In contemporary Chinese sources, Palembang was mostly known as Jiugang (lit. \\"Old Harbor\\"). During the second voyage, the rulers of Calicut, Malacca, and Champa had made it a policy to cooperate with Ming China and gave the treasure fleet a series of bases from where they could operate during their travels.. For the second voyage, one of the main responsibilities was to confer formal investiture on the King of Calicut... Early in the voyages, Ceylon was perceived with considerable enmity by China. Its rulers were even actively hostile towards the treasure fleet when they arrived during the third voyage.. On the Malabar coast, Calicut and Cochin were in an intense rivalry, so the Ming decided to intervene by granting special status to Cochin and its ruler Keyili (ÂèØ‰∫¶Èáå).. For the fifth voyage, Zheng He was instructed to confer a seal upon Keyili of Cochin and enfeoff a mountain in his kingdom as the Zhenguo Zhi Shan (ÈéÆÂúã‰πãÂ±±, Mountain Which Protects the Country). He delivered a stone tablet, inscribed with a proclamation composed by the Yongle Emperor, to Cochin. As long as Cochin remained under the protection of Ming China, the Zamorin of Calicut was unable to invade Cochin and a military conflict was averted. The cessation of the Ming treasure voyages consequently had a negative outcome for Cochin, because the Zamorin would eventually launch an invasion against Cochin. Coinciding with the first voyage, China was in war with Vietnam and was set on conquering it. Champa was an ally of China and in state of conflict with Vietnam, thus they received the support of China.. In 1408, King Ghiyath-ud- Din of Bengal sent a tribute mission to China.. In 1412, an envoy was sent to announce the death of King Ghiyath-ud-Din and the accession of his son Sa'if- ud-Din as the new king. In 1414, King Jalal-ud-Din (r. 1414‚Äì1431) sent a giraffe as tribute to China. In 1415, the Yongle Emperor sent Hou Xian to confer gifts to the king, queen, and ministers of Bengal. Hou Xian was a Grand Director who had accompanied Zheng He during the second and third voyage. In 1438, Bengal sent a giraffe as tribute to China. In 1439, Bengal sent a tribute mission to China. Ma Huan and the Mingshi described Aden as a Muslim country whose people were overbearing and whose ruler had 7 to 8 thousand well-drilled horsemen and foot soldiers, thus the country was relatively powerful and its neighbors were fearful of it.. Aden's king was al-Malik an- Nasir Salah-ad-Din Ahmad (r. 1400‚Äì1424) of the Rasulid dynasty, who earlier had taken control of Yemen from the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. King Ahmad accepted the imperial edict and gifts that he received from the Chinese envoys and greeted them \\"with great reverence and humility\\" when they visited Aden during the treasure fleet's fifth voyage. He may have hoped for military assistance against the threat that the Mamluk Sultanate posed at the time. Even though the fleet returned in the sixth voyage, Yemen fell apart when their slave soldiers repeatedly rebelled under the reigns of King Ahmed's descendants: Abdallah, (r. 1424‚Äì1427, his son), Isma'il II (r.1427‚Äì1428, his son), and Yahya (r. 1428‚Äì1439, son of Isma'il II). The Mingshi noted that Aden had sent a total of four tribute missions to China. In reference to the last expedition in connection to the Mamluk Sultanate, Ibn Taghribirdi's account, dated 21 June 1432, recorded a report that came from Mecca about two Chinese ships that had anchored at Aden after departing from India. The two captains of the ships had written to Sharif Barakat ibn Hasan ibn Ajlan (Emir of Mecca) and Sa'd al-Din Ibrahim ibn al-Marra (controller of Jeddah) for permission to come to Jeddah, as stated by the report, since the cargo was not loaded off the ships in Aden due to the disorder in Yemen. The account noted that the latter two wrote to the sultan about this, making him eager for the many Chinese goods, thus the sultan wrote back that the Chinese may come to Jeddah and are to be treated with honor.. Several African nations sent ambassadors who presented elephants and rhinoceroses as tribute to China.. In 1415, Malindi presented a giraffe.. The final tribute mission from Malindi was in 1416, but it is not known which local products were presented to the Ming court.. According to Zheng He's two inscriptions, Mogadishu presented zebras () and lions as tribute to them during the fifth voyage.Dreyer 2007, 88. The inscriptions also noted that Brava presented camels and ostriches as tribute during the voyage. Brava sent a total of four tribute missions to China from 1416 to 1423. Aden had sent tribute giraffes on the fifth and sixth voyages, but the one on the fifth never arrived in China. Mecca had also sent them on the seventh voyage. The giraffes were not likely to be native to Aden or Mecca. Bengal also sent a tribute giraffe, although it was said that it was a re-export from Malindi. Between 30 December 1418 and 27 January 1419, Ming China's treasure fleet visited Yemen under the reign of Al Malik al Nasir. The Chinese envoy, presumably Admiral Zheng He, was accompanied by the Yemeni envoy Kadi Wazif al-Abdur Rahman bin-Zumeir who escorted him to the Yemeni court. The Chinese brought gifts equivalent to 20,000 , comprising expensive perfumes, scented wood, and Chinese potteries. The Yemeni ruler sent luxury goods made from coral at the port of Ifranza, wild cattle and donkeys, domesticated lion cubs, and wild and trained leopards in exchange. The Yemeni envoy accompanied the Chinese to the port of Aden with the gifts, which maintained trade under the facade of gift exchange..

Career and activities Hutchins was introduced in 1966, to strength training by a family friend who explained the importance of physical strength to musicianship and built Hutchins his first weight bench. Later, in 1968, this friend introduced Hutchins to Ellington Darden, and through Darden in 1971, Hutchins learned of Arthur Jones and Nautilus, Inc. strength-training principles. Hutchins's serious contributions to the field of exercise, began in 1975 when he served Darden as a proofreader and writer. In 1977, Hutchins was employed at Nautilus as a surgery technician, writer, surgical photographer, and proofreader. From 1979 to 1982, he served as inside salesperson and traveling speaker, addressing scores of Nautilus clinics yearly. In 1982, Hutchins and his wife, Brenda, were sent by [Arthur Jones] to Gainesville, Florida, to supervise the exercise program for the Nautilus- sponsored osteoporosis study at the University of Florida Medical School. During this year, Hutchins wrote the SuperSlow Protocol article. He refined its application with over 8,000 one-on-one workouts between 1982 and 1986. In 1986, Hutchins worked as an exercise equipment designer and prototypist, specializing in the application of coupled movement arms. In 1987, he compiled historical developments of Nautilus equipment and wrote video scripts for detailed Nautilus education. After leaving Nautilus, Hutchins established his own exercise practice, continuing to develop the Super Slow techniques and eventually publishing several editions of a technical manualHutchins, Ken (1989, 1992). Super Slow: The Ultimate Exercise Protocol. Casselberry, Florida: Super Slow Systems. . for the application of Super Slow exercise. In the early 1990s, a certification program was developed for exercise professionals to bring standardization to SuperSlow training. Hutchins developed an interest group, calling it the Super Slow Exercise Guild (Inc.), which met to refine techniques and published articles in its newsletter, The Exercise Standard, from 1994 to 2000. Numerous similar methods have been spun off by members of the guild and others as their ideas or business models developed. The New York Times Magazine included Super Slow and Hutchins in its Year in Ideas: An Encyclopedia of innovations, conceptual leaps, harebrained schemes, cultural tremors & hindsight reconings that made a difference in 2001.\\"Year in Ideas...\\". The New York Times Magazine. December 9, 2001: 103. In 2009, Hutchins and his wife joined Renaissance Exercise, continuing to produce evolutionary designs for exercise equipment. Expanded exercise technique and protocol descriptionsHutchins, Ken (2011). The Renaissance of Exercise. Casselberry, Florida: Renaissance Exercise, 2011. were published in 2011. Contributions Hutchins's major accomplishments during the Nautilus Osteoporosis Project were: * Composing the Exercise vs. Recreation Philosophy. * Discovering the principle of the variable counterbalance applied to counterbalance human bodytorque. * Identifying friction as a major issue in exercise equipment and motor control. * Identifying four major considerations for the first comprehensive definition of exercise. * Evolving photographic standardization for comparing the results of exercise and diet programs. * Discovering that all human muscular functions are negative-cam effects. * Identifying the conflict between assumed and real objective as a major psychological challenge in exercise. In the early 1990s, Hutchins and his wife developed and patented the Linear Spine(R) Machines for his company, SuperSlow (R) Systems, Inc. This equipment was designed to provide crucial exercise for severely debilitated back and abdominal musculatures.

The faces has a great amount of detail when compared against the subject's body and clothing, which was a common theme within the couple's portraits. When the face is rendered this way, it gives the viewer a sense of emotion and feeling from the subject. These details found within the face correlate with the intricacies found within the garments when they contained lace or a decorative print. The shoulders of the female subjects angle downward sharply, elongating the figures. Typical to these portraits, the sleeves of the garments appear oversized and rounded compared to the arms, which could appear thin, especially on a male figure. On many of their male and female figures, the torso is short and the waist can be pinched inward, giving the body an hourglass shape. The backgrounds of these portraits contain intense strokes of watercolor that contain various mixes of blues, greens, and browns. The women's hair was commonly stylized in brown rolls, simulating pinned curls. On the contrary, the males‚Äô hair was commonly short. Some subjects can be found sitting, standing, and holding certain objects, relating to the subject in general. For example, a subject could be holding a book, which could represent their intelligence, and decorative elements found on the subject's chair could represent their knowledge and appreciation of current fashion trends and home d√©cor.Murphy, Kevin D.

Typically located in less desirable areas of the venue, such as the bleachers and upper decks, all-you-can-eat (AYCE) seats are priced approximately 50% higher than seats in the same section, but are viewed by patrons as a bargain considering the high cost of concession food and drinks. The first AYCE section was introduced at Dodger Stadium in 2007. The trend spread to 19 of the 30 Major League Baseball parks by 2010 and numerous Minor League Baseball parks by 2012. While most common among baseball stadiums, by 2008 AYCE seats were also inaugurated in venues of other sports, including six National Basketball Association and nine National Hockey League arenas, Canadian Football League stadiums, and several NASCAR racetracks. The National Football League remains the only North American major pro sports league where no stadiums have implemented AYCE seats. Luxury boxes and club seating are typically all-inclusive with unlimited food and drink during the duration of the event; however, they are not referred to as AYCE seats due to their desirable location in the venue and higher ticket price relative to other seating. Furthermore, the menu for luxury box and club seating is higher quality, ranging from buffets to chef-prepared gourmet dishes and fresh produce (as opposed to AYCE which consists mostly of fast food and junk food), and often with servers to cater to these patrons. History The Los Angeles Dodgers introduced the first Major League Baseball AYCE section in April 2007 after conducting three pilots during the 2006 season. Soon after, the Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, and Texas Rangers converted their under-utilized seats to AYCE seats. The concept spread to 13 Major League Baseball parks in 2008 and 19 parks in 2010. Major League Baseball teams offering all-you-can-eat seats include the Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Miami Marlins, Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, Texas Rangers, and Toronto Blue Jays. Beginning with the 2018 NFL Season, the Detroit Lions introduced Club 200. This premium seating option includes all-you-can-eat items such as hot dogs, popcorn, nachos, pretzels, chips, cotton candy, salad and soda. The section in Ford Field also includes two drink tickets and a dedicated giveaway item at each game.https://www.detroitlions.com/tickets/premium-seating/club-200 Since March 2020, when games were played behind closed doors, such seats have been suspended. Description All-you-can-eat seats at Petco Park, 2009 All-you- can-eat seats are typically located in \\"distant bleacher or upper-deck sections\\". Seat prices are marked up approximately 50% over the regular price of seats in that section. The AYCE buffet generally operates from the time the stadium gates open until the beginning or end of the seventh inning. Some parks put an hourly limit on it ‚Äì for example, food service is open for two hours after the first pitch at San Diego Padres games and until 9 p.m. at Minnesota Twins games. The basic menu includes traditional ballpark food such as hot dogs, nachos, peanuts, popcorn, and soft drinks. Some ballparks add other options, such as \\"veggie dogs\\" at Petco Park, green salad, ice cream, and kosher and veggie dogs (by advance request) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and \\"burgers, salads, peanut butter-filled pretzels and ice cream\\" at PNC Park. Some ballparks limit the amount of food an AYCE patron can take on each trip to the buffet. At Dodger Stadium, AYCE patrons are limited to four hot dogs per visit, but can take as many soft drinks and bottles of water as they wish. At Camden Yards, patrons may take up to two of each food item on each visit. A further appeal to AYCE patrons is that the lines move quickly, as no cash transactions are involved. At Dodger Stadium, AYCE ticket-holders enter and exit through a different gate than other ticket-holders and can access only the AYCE buffet and a set of restrooms. At other ballparks, ticket-holders wear colored wristbands to identify themselves as AYCE patrons. At Camden Yards, AYCE ticket-holders have their hand stamped. Popularity View from the all-you-can-eat seats at Oriole Park at Camden Yards All-you- can-eat seats have successfully boosted attendance in ballparks experiencing low turnouts, as well as increased occupancy of stadium sections that were previously under-used. At Dodger Stadium, for example, before 2007 the right- field bleachers were opened only when the left-field bleachers sold out, or for group sales. Following the conversion of the right-field bleachers into an AYCE section of 3,300 seats, occupancy zoomed to 85%. The Arizona Diamondbacks boosted ticket sales by 70% when it created a left-field AYCE section in 2009, while the Houston Astros averaged 95% capacity in its AYCE section. From the patrons' point of view, AYCE seats are viewed as a bargain considering the added cost of ballpark food. After a few orders of hot dogs, nachos, and soft drinks, the AYCE seat pays for itself. The Atlanta Braves estimated that a typical AYCE patron in 2007 consumed 3.35 hot dogs, 20 ounces of soda, 7.9 ounces of peanuts; 3 ounces of nachos; and 32 ounces of popcorn. AYCE seats have been described as a way to indulge in junk food \\"with baseball as a nominal backdrop\\", an opportunity to eat a cheap dinner with a baseball game thrown in, and a way to feed a family on a budget. AYCE patrons have been known to engage in eating contests and to sneak food home with them.

According to Historic Environment Scotland, it is a Category A listed building.  Architecture  The building is a quadrangle in shape, built in ashlar of polished cream-coloured sandstone, with two storeys and a raised basement. The ground floor, and both storeys of the pavilions, are arcaded with timber-framed sash windows of twelve panes and decorated with a base course and an impost course. On the first floor storey is a cill course, a cornice, and a blocking course. The corners and the centre of each of the sides has a projecting taller pavilion consisting of one bay, with one window on each storey, with those at the building's corner topped with a square base supporting a cupola and freestanding columns at each angle. The corner towers at the front carry a weather vane and a clock; while the corresponding openings on the towers at the rear are blind. In the central courtyard is a circular reading room under a dome. The front elevation consists of thirteen architectural bays, of which the outermost one at each end, ornamented by a balustrade, comprise the advanced pavilions at the corners. Each of the corner pavilions has on the upper storey a single Venetian window with Ionic columns in a recessed round arch and framed by Corinthian columns. The other windows on the upper storey are decorated with architraves and cornices, while those three that are above the central portico have balustrades and consoled cornices. Beneath the upper and lower storeys, the building is of rusticated ashlar to the ground level. The entrance, in the centre of the front, is approached by an imperial staircase and framed by a tetrastyle portico of the Corinthian order. Decorative panels in Liardet's stucco with festoon motifs decorate the wall above the portico, while the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom decorates the pediment. At the rear of the original building, the portico's place in the centre is taken by a five-bay centrepiece, with arcaded windows on the lower storey and corniced and pedimented windows alternating on the upper floor. The roof is of slate and of piended contraction, though the roof of the central dome is of lead. Inside, the dome was plastered by Thomas Clayton to neoclassical designs by Adam made in 1785. Robert Reid designed the metal gates that enter the rotunda under the dome. There are staircases in the east and west ends of the building, each now fitted with a lift shaft. The Lord Clerk Register's room is behind the entrance portico, adorned with a frieze and a chimneypiece in grey marble. Beyond the rotunda is \\"Historical Search Room\\", previously the \\"Antiquarian Room\\", a two-storey timber-galleried room of bookcases with a coffered ceiling with rosettes.  Restoration  In 1969, the stonework was cleaned by abrasive blasting. The plasterwork in the dome was repainted in 1973/4. The entrance hall was restored and adapted in 1993, and a new chimneypiece installed.

Frau Antje is a Dutch character used in the advertising of cheese (and other dairy products). \\"Frau\\" is German for \\"Ms.\\", and \\"Antje\\" is a first name that is as acceptable in German as it is in Dutch: the character was created specifically for the advertising the export of Dutch cheese to Germany. Frau Antje was born during the 1959 edition of the Berlin International Green Week, a trade fair for agriculture and nutrition. Apparently, a young Dutch woman from The Hague named Antje was working the booth of the Dutch Dairy Organization (NZB), serving cheese; when she fell ill and her colleagues kept being asked \\"where Frau Antje was\\", the chief of the NZB decided there was commercial potential in the idea. He hired Kitty Janssen to be the first Frau Antje (1961), dressed in a supposedly traditional Dutch costume and wearing wooden shoes. Frau Antje's costume, which was designed specifically for her, does not represent any specific traditional Dutch costume, though the \\"wings\\" on the headdress are reminiscent of the traditional costume of Volendam: since Volendam is a well-known tourist destination, it can be said to represent \\"Dutchness\\" pars pro toto.Elpers, \\"Frau Antje--Die (K√§se-)Botschafterin?\\" 333. The name Antje was chosen (or retained) since it appears to Germans as a typically Dutch name, and is indeed common in the three northernmost Dutch provinces.Elpers, \\"Frau Antje--Die (K√§se-)Botschafterin?\\" 337. Frau Antje's image Early in her career, Frau Antje resembled an exemplary housewife or even a home economics teacher. From an authoritative position she addressed herself to housewives, and the world portrayed in those advertisements was typical of the post-World War II period, whose values were cleanness, sobriety, propriety, with the family at the center. In the mid-1960s she became a more coquettish figure, even enticing the viewer into her bedroom (while she's holding a cheese, of course). Of more importance in the ads of the 1970s and 1980s was the stereotypical portrayal of the Dutch landscape, with green meadows, blue canals, and black and white cows; it is in this landscape that Antje presents the viewer with a table full of cheese. Antje returns to the kitchen in the mid-1980s, but this time, unlike in the 1960s, she is an emancipated, private person, no longer a traditional teacher, in an attempt to appeal to a more fragmented audience living a multitude of lifestyles. In the second half of the 1990s, Antje, now an independent and self-assured cheese expert, was even more emancipated, and while still dressed in her traditional garb she dances to techno music. Finally, after 2003, she is turned into a kind of fairy character, and rather than work in her own (Dutch) environment, she is inserted into German household situations where she advises families in their hypermodern kitchens, emphasizing the chronological distance between those interiors and her own old-fashioned clothing.Elpers, \\"Frau Antje--Die (K√§se-)Botschafterin?\\" 337-38.

It stands on a hill, providing an excellent view of Spaccanapoli, a Decumanus of Naples which ends across via Francesco Girardi. From the door of the church, one has a direct view across Naples through the straight decumanus. The church also faces the former convent of Santissima Trinit√† delle Monache. History In 1411, a shrine with a statue of the Virgin was converted by the locals into a chapel called Santa Maria d'Ognibene (Holy Mary of all gifts). After the plague of 1516, the chapel and statue became a convent and church run by the Servite Order. In 1597, the cardinal Alfonso Carafa made this into a parish church, which was then briefly attached to the Congregation of Pii Operari, which had been started by Carlo Carafa. It was retransferred to the Servites, and remained so till 1809, till the monks were expelled. When they left, they took with them the statue of the Addolorata.Guida Sacra della citta di Napoli per Gennaro Aspreno Galante, 1873, page 365-366. The church and the Servite order was attached to a form of Marian devotion centered around the sette dolori, which roughly translates to the seven sorrows, of the Maria Addolorata (Our Lady of Sorrows). These sorrows are roughly identified from scriptural interpretations. When the cholera struck Naples in 1836, the parish retrieved the statue and in 1837 placed it on the main altar. The church in 1849 was named a minor basilica by Pope Pius IX. The church we see now was mainly built starting 1640, by designs of Giovanni Cola Cocco. Other sources attribute the work to Nicola Tagliacozzi Canale.Storiacity entry on church. A number of artworks are associated with the church.

History  The Lexington Hotel opened in 1929The Architect, Cover Story, January 1930 as the Hotel Lexington, at the height of the Manhattan midtown hotel boom, 1920s to the 1930s. The hotel opened with a promise by General J. Leslie Kincaid, president of the American Hotel Corporation, to provide a thoroughly modern house of refined atmosphere and exceptional service ‚Äì without the annoyance and confusion that is often experienced in hotels catering to large assemblages. The original architect was Schultze & Weaver whose first major commission job had been the large Los Angeles hotel today known as the Millennium Biltmore. Their later work included the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel, and the Coral Gables Biltmore Hotel. The firm also designed the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach and the Miami Nautilus Hotel. They designed several noted landmark hotels within New York City, including: *The Park Lane Hotel *The Waldorf Astoria *The Lexington Hotel *The Pierre Hotel *The Sherry-Netherland The Normanesque terracotta figures that decorate the Lexington Avenue entrance are reminiscent of those found on the Notre Dame. Rows of terracotta-winged lions adorn the building‚Äôs fa√ßade. Beneath a metal canopy, inscribed with the hotel‚Äôs name, visitors pass through the expansive glass doors into the spacious marbled-floored lobby. In the 1930s, the Lexington was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz's National Hotel Management CompanyFred Hall, Dialogues in Swing: Intimate Conversations with the Stars of the Big Band Era, Page 7, Pathfinder Publishing, First Edition 1989. Present day The property now belongs to Marriott‚Äôs \\"Autograph Collection\\" of fifty hotels that have historic qualities to them. In 2014, a $46 million renovation was completed that restored historic architectural elements including the original brass elevator doors with songbird motifs. Significance The Hotel Lexington was home to many famous restaurants, nightspots and celebrities, including: *Joe DiMaggio, baseball legend, who resided at the hotel between 1957 and 1962, while he was affiliated with the Monette Company. *Marilyn Monroe lived here with DiMaggio during their brief marriage in Suite #1806. *Dorothy Lamour, Hollywood celebrity The hotel evolved and in the 1930s the ‚ÄúHawaiian Room‚Äù opened in what is now \\"LQ\\".

Forester. It was released on 6 January 2003, nearly four years after the first four films, nine months after the next two films, and a day after episode 7: Loyalty. The series received four nominations for the 2004 56th Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Miniseries, Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or Movie, Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special and Outstanding Single-Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or Movie, although it is not clear whether they were for Duty or Loyalty or both.

However, Admiral Pellew arrives and gives Hornblower his next mission: HMS Grasshopper, commanded by old friend Captain Bracegirdle, has gone missing while on patrol off the coast of France. Hornblower is to find her. He gives Hornblower permission to sleep ashore with his bride on their honeymoon night. The next day, Hornblower sets sail. As a wedding gift, Pellew gives Hornblower his steward, James Doughty, an accomplished cook, who replaces Styles. On a stormy night, the Hotspur rescues the passengers of a small boat in danger of sinking off the coast of France, including a man claiming to be Swiss and his American wife. The man speaks with a strong French accent, raising suspicions. The American woman tells Hornblower that they saw a ship get stranded just to the north of them. Hornblower finds the Grasshopper grounded and much of the crew drowned. The rest, after surviving the wreck have been killed defending their captain from French troops. As Hornblower and his men are attacked by the French, they find and rescue Captain Bracegirdle among the casualties alive and distraught at the loss of his ship and crew. It is revealed that Wolfe, from the previous film, commands the French troops. They return to the waiting Hotspur. Back in England, Pellew has received orders from the Admiralty to find a young couple, the daughter of a wealthy American merchant and a Frenchman, who are somewhere at sea near France. Meanwhile, off the French coast, Wolfe's French troops try to take the Hotspur but fail, though Wolfe escapes. Afterward, under questioning by Hornblower, the \\"Swiss\\" passenger confesses he is J√©r√¥me- Napol√©on Bonaparte, the younger brother of Napoleon. Bracegirdle suggests returning to England, with their valuable passengers right away, but Hornblower chooses to complete Bracegirdle's original mission, that of investigating French military activities on shore. The crew, especially Styles, deeply resent their French passengers. Back in England, Pellew learns from a diplomatic service official that Napoleon's brother and his heiress wife are aboard the Hotspur. Hornblower, Bracegirdle, and their reconnaissance party discover quantities of French maritime cannons hidden ashore for reasons unknown. Bracegirdle goes off by himself to find out more; he discovers why but before he can reach Hornblower with the information is killed by the French. Hornblower reports back to Admiral Pellew, who informs him that the diplomatic service has quarantined the Hotspur to keep J√©r√¥me-Napol√©on's presence in England a secret: no one can debark or board, captain included. Stranded on shore Hornblower takes the opportunity to spend three days with Maria. Hornblower is then ordered to take J√©r√¥me-Napol√©on to France and to transfer his wife Betsy to another ship to be sent home to her father in America. Hornblower orders Doughty to make the couple a good meal. Doughty learns Styles has placed a dead rat in the stew he is taking them. This leads to a fistfight during which Doughty accidentally strikes Midshipman Orrock, an offence, according to the Articles of War, punishable by death. Doughty is clapped in irons. Hornblower explains to J√©r√¥me-Napol√©on that he must go ashore alone. This J√©r√¥me does, reluctantly, in the hope of persuading his older brother to welcome his wife. The next day Hornblower and Bush return ashore and discover that the cannons they found earlier had been removed from three frigates anchored in a bay, freeing up enough space to transport 1000 soldiers each. The plan is for Wolfe and 3,000 French soldiers to invade Ireland. Hornblower takes the Hotspur through a dense fog in dangerously shallow water to attack the departing frigates by stealth. He fires upon and disables the first. The other two run aground and collide with each other. Wolfe falls onto the Hotspur, where he is killed trying to shoot Hornblower. On Christmas Day the Hotspur rendezvous with the Liberty, which will take Betsy to America. Hornblower summons the disgraced steward, Doughty, and, after dropping hints, leaves him alone and unguarded so he can jump ship and swim to the Liberty and freedom in America. Later, it is revealed that Napoleon is pressuring Rome to annul his brother's marriage. Then Admiral Pellew informs Hornblower that he has been promoted. He reminds his subordinate that, according to long-standing tradition, when a commancer-in- chief strikes down his flag he is permitted to make three promotions: midshipman to lieutenant, lieutenant to commander, and commander to post- captain. Pellew promotes Hornblower to post-captain. Hornblower receives further good news from his wife Maria: she is pregnant.

Under the Radar described the album as \\"[making] little attempt to veil his affection for the zillion-dollar, slickly produced, mammoth-sized pop albums of the 1980s; the results are as charming and imaginative as one may have come to expect from one of the blogosphere‚Äôs most buzzed-about artists.\\" On the album's extensive use of collaboration with other artists, Manuel stated \\"It was always the intention to have loads of guests from the very beginning.

His parents, Evermont \\"Mont\\" and Rachel Mitchell Nash, were strict Seventh-day Adventists, sending their son to religious school when he was thirteen years old. Nash graduated from high school at Greentown, Indiana, and then from the Adventist Theological Seminary in Battle Creek, Michigan. Ordained in 1894, he subsequently took a position as an instructor at the Adventist school for ministers and missionaries in Detroit. Soon after he began teaching in Michigan, Nash befriended an elderly woman, Agnes \\"Mother\\" d'Arcambal, founder of The d'Arcambal Home of Industry for Discharged Prisoners, visiting her every week for eight or nine months. The elders of Nash's church informed him that d'Arcambal had rejected Adventist teachings years earlier. They pressed him to admit that according to Adventist doctrine which forbade Sunday worship, d'Arcambal, who had been holding Sunday services at the home, could not, therefore, be saved in death. Nash reacted by abandoning his faith, his family, and his religious ambitions, becoming a train hopping hobo, itinerant worker, and conflicted atheist. Early years In his autobiography, The Golden Rule In Business, Nash wrote; \\"For four or five years I wandered about the Middle West, doing odd jobs here and there... I never cared two straws which way a freight train was headed... or what it was I did to keep body and soul together.\\" He lugged bricks, did plastering work, labored in a broom factory, and with a bridge-construction gang‚Äîall the while studying Thomas Paine and Robert Ingersoll, endeavoring to bolster his contempt for religion. Eventually Nash found his way back to Detroit, where, with the help of some locals, he opened a laundry, and then married Y.W.C.A. boarding school superintendent, Maude Lena Southwell, calling her his \\"life partner.\\" Described by Nash as being \\"possessed by a strong, robust faith,\\" under Maude's influence, Nash came to view his arguments as being not against Christianity itself, but against its misinterpretation. He reentered the ministry with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and in 1900, accepted the pastorate of a small church in Bluffton, Ohio. But Nash's rekindled career in religious work ended with \\"bewildering suddenness,\\" when, in a funeral sermon, he extolled the many virtues of a kindhearted but professedly unreligious man, recently departed. The Disciples of Christ called for Nash's resignation forthwith. =Marriage and children= Married Elizabeth Carlston, June 25, 1894 *William Albert Nash, born January 9, 1890 Married Maude Lena Southwell, April 9, 1899 *Ralph M. Nash, born April 21, 1900 *Grace Nash Straehlev, born 1902 Career With a wife and three children to support, Nash was persuaded by a group of Chicago clothing salesmen to join their crew, and it soon became apparent that he made a better salesman than preacher. In 1909, he moved his family to Columbus, Ohio, and began manufacturing men's clothing to sell direct to the consumer. By 1913, Nash had a dozen outside salesmen in his employ, and had begun to show a profit, when the Great Flood of 1913 all but ruined him financially. He found security for a seven hundred dollar note he owed the bank, and obtained permission from his creditors to move his inventory. In June, 1916, with the United States positioning to enter World War I, the A. Nash Company was incorporated with a capital of sixty thousand dollars, and opened for business in Cincinnati's depressed garment and textile market. With an office, cutting room, but no working factory of his own, Nash supplied his customers with made-to-order men's suits by having the garments cut at his facility, and then contracting their manufacture to an Austrian man who leased floor space from Nash in the Power Building on East 8th Street. =Expanded description= In early 1917, with his son, William, already fighting with the Canadian Corps in France, Nash was approached by the pastor of the First Universalist Church in Cincinnati, and asked to fill in as preacher on a Sunday upcoming‚Äîthe pastor stating he would select the subject for Nash's sermon. Having himself been challenged by Nash regarding Christianity's role in what Nash called, \\"the frightful carnage going on in Europe,\\" the pastor asked Nash to go and talk to his people about what, in Nash's opinion, was the matter with Christianity. Just as he was preparing for his verbal \\"assault\\" on the Christian faith, Nash received word that William had been seriously wounded in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. When Nash's youngest son, Ralph, heard that his brother was, \\"hanging between life and death in a hospital in England,\\" he immediately joined up with the Marines. His factory unequipped to handle government contracts, Nash became so discouraged that he almost closed up shop, spending most of his time selling Liberty bonds, and other war work. By the time the Armistice was signed, he had all but suspended business operations. Distraught at having two sons involved in a war to which he viscerally objected, Nash experienced his darkest hour. Though he still thought himself an atheist, his mind harkened back to the teachings of his youth. In his own words: \\"Under great agony of soul I was finally driven to my knees, and there was torn from my heart perhaps the first real prayer that I had ever uttered. It was, 'O God, if there is a God, show me the way and I will walk in it.'\\" He reread the gospels‚Äîa text he had once virtually committed to memory‚Äîto gain a deeper understanding of \\"what it really was Jesus sought to establish, what to teach, [and] what, if anything, to condemn.\\" Nash discovered that the Golden Rule governed Jesus' life and was the central theme to all of his teachings. He concluded that Jesus' \\"chief concern was the establishment of the principles of the kingdom of God on earth,\\" through the application of the Golden Rule, as expressed in Matthew 7:12. This realization caused Nash to undergo a complete change of heart regarding the theme of his upcoming sermon. For more, see Philosophical and religious views. =Business takes off= The year 1919 Shortly after the Armistice, which effectively ended the war, the Austrian, who wished to return to Europe and see to his mother, offered Nash the purchase of his small factory, which consisted of three or four tables, a few tools and machines, and twenty-nine workers. Nash agreed, and the transaction was completed at the beginning of 1919. Subsequently, and upon examination of his new business's payroll, he was \\"dumbfounded\\" to discover that he had bought a sweatshop.\\" As he consulted his family, the idea of raising wages was mentioned. William‚Äîjust home from the war‚Äîprotested that the company had lost four thousand dollars the previous fiscal year, therefore any significant new payroll expense would put them swiftly out of business. Nash, who had begun giving talks on the Golden Rule around town, informed his fellow stockholders that he would rather close up shop than exploit the men and women in his employ. Calling his workers together, including a woman of nearly eighty who had been earning four dollars per week sewing on buttons, another woman with kyphosis (hunchback), earning the same, and two Austrians with no English, Nash said to them, in part: > First, I want you to know that Brotherhood is a reality with me. You are all > my brothers and sisters, children of the same great Father that I am, and > entitled to all the justice and fair treatment that I want for myself. And > so long as we run this shop [which to Nash meant three or four months > longer] God being my helper, I am going to treat you as my brothers and > sisters, and the Golden Rule is going to be our only governing law. Which > means, that whatever I would like to have you do to me, were I in your > place, I am going to do to you. Then he raised both women's wages from four dollars per week, to twelve‚Äîtripling their pay with a two hundred percent increase. And having established the precedent, he worked all the way through his wage-sheet to the pressers whose weekly pay was eighteen dollars, raising them to twenty seven‚Äîa higher wage scale than had ever been paid in comparable shops in the city. In hopes he would have enough money left over after liquidating equipment and surplus fabric and then making up stockholder losses, Nash turned attention away from his business and toward Indiana, where he went in search of a small farm on which to retire. Two months later, a friend in serious financial need sparked Nash's visit to his bookkeeper to inquire how much cash he could command, and he was astounded to discover that his newly acquired factory had more than tripled its business from the previous year. When Nash questioned his employees, he learned that after he had raised their wages and departed their company, \\"the little Italian presser\\" had addressed his fellow workers, saying that if he was boss and had just raised everyone's wages as Nash had, he would want everyone to \\"work like hell\\"‚Äîand that's just what they did. Nash shelved the idea of buying a farm and instead caught a train for New York to purchase more fabric. In 1919, the year Nash took over the little sweatshop, America experienced the greatest wave of labor unrest in its history, with more than four million workers striking (though A. Nash Company workers never staged a walk-out). Anti-union sentiment swept the country's business community, and Nash was determined not to further antagonize it. His factory was small, one of the smallest concerns in Cincinnati, his workforce largely inexperienced, and he required credit with bankers and suppliers, and so he concluded that his should remain an open shop. Though many accused Nash of standing with the anti-union movement, according to Philip I. Roberts‚Äîwho, for a posthumous edition of Nash's autobiography, wrote of the four years intervening between its publication and Nash's death‚Äîthis is \\"an absolute mistake.\\" Nash called it, \\"the year of strikes, [and] industrial upheavals,\\" especially in the garment and textile industries known for their underpaid, underfed, \\"pauper labor.\\" Clothing prices skyrocketed, and production slowed to a near halt. Five other garment firms housed along with Nash's in the Power Building participated in Cincinnati's fourteen-week-long clothing workers strike. During the first week of the strike, which lasted from March through mid-June, A. Nash Company employees had to fight their way across picket lines. The remainder of the strike, for reasons Nash said he could not explain, his workers were able to cross unmolested, and were even treated courteously by the pickets. That year Nash's company did $525,678.43 worth of business, as compared to $132,190.20 the year previous, and by July, had outgrown its floor space in the Power Building, and moved into the vacated Joe Magnus Whisky Distillery building, also on East 8th. Going from one floor, to six, and hesitant to advertise, Nash told his employees that if they liked their jobs, to spread the word to their friends and neighbors, and then bring them into the factory and train them themselves. Nash's workforce quickly grew six hundred percent, without a single want ad. The year 1920 At the end of February, after absorbing the fifty thousand dollar expense of moving his factory, and giving his employees a series of raises that culminated at twenty percent, Nash found it was costing his company less to make a suit than it had before the payroll increases. When he proposed a profit-sharing plan to his workers, they opted to take theirs in wages. But they surprised Nash when the highest paid among them relinquished their claim to a considerable sum by petitioning management to base shared profits on time worked instead of on wages drawn.\\" In July, the public was accused of going on a non-buying strike when the American Woolen Company shut down more than half of its mills due to the cancelation by struggling clothing factories of over one hundred thousand dollars worth of woolen and textile orders. Across the country, six hundred thousand needle workers were put out of their jobs. Unemployment had reached serious proportions, and in the fall Nash's employees once again presented management with a resolution, this time volunteering to take four weeks' vacation so that unemployed workers of Cincinnati might be given work in their place. Of this resolution, Nash wrote, \\"I was moved as I have seldom been moved... It demonstrated that the Golden Rule had indeed become the lifeblood of our plant.\\" That year the A. Nash Company did $1,580,700.46 worth of business‚Äîmore than triple that of the year before‚Äî and Nash began issuing stock dividends to his employees. The year 1921 Despite the Depression of 1920-21‚Äîwhile industrial activities were shrinking and many businesses failing‚Äîthe A. Nash Company again reached factory capacity and bought Cincinnati's vacant Moerlein Brewering Company bottling works, located on the southeast corner of Henry and Elm. Neither the bottling works, nor the converted distillery, were well adapted to the purpose of a clothing factory, and before extensive remodeling took place, Nash came under much criticism for not providing adequate facilities for his workers, especially the women. =The Amalgamated= Cincinnati's clothing workers strike of 1919 was largely financed through the general treasury of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (A.C.W.A., or simply, \\"the Amalgamated\\"). Local 113 (tailors), which had been chartered in 1915, and Local 188 (pressers), whose charter in March 1919, precipitated the fourteen-week-long strike, united with Local 189 (cutters) on August 27, to form the Cincinnati Joint Board of the A.C.W.A., and by 1921, while Nash split his attention between public speaking and developing his newly acquired bottling plant into a clothing factory, the Joint Board focused its attention on organizing the Nash factories for the union. On December 8, at Nash's invitation, the Amalgamated's president, Sidney Hillman, met with Nash in a hotel room in New York. Nash described for Hillman the awkward and false position he felt himself in, finding his Golden Rule experiment used as an argument against unionizing other factories. Nash invited Hillman to Cincinnati to address a meeting of his workers Christmas week, with a view toward bringing the union in. When Nash returned to Cincinnati on December 10, he found that during his absence the Joint Board had distributed two \\"scurrilous bulletins\\" inside his factories. That same day, Nash wrote to Hillman and rescinded the invitation, citing the resentment that had been aroused among his workers. Nash went on to express his sincere regret, but also his faith in \\"the eternal destiny,\\" wishing Hillman every success in his great work. Nash had no sooner signed the letter than his presence was requested at \\"a great mass meeting\\" called by his employees, wherein they presented him with a resolution calling for the immediate resignation of any A. Nash Company employees from the ranks of the Amalgamated, or else forfeit their jobs. Nash went on record as saying, \\"I am opposed to this open shop movement, although the A. Nash Company is not unionized. So long as the present avaricious organizations of capital continue, I can conceive of no worse condition of abject servitude than for labour to be unorganized.\\" From that time until the end of his life, Nash spent a large portion of his time traveling around the country preaching the Golden Rule to businessmen's and social welfare organizations, \\"with fiery oratory and sincere fervor.\\" The year 1922 The September issue of Success magazine featured an article by Ruth White Colton, who, posing as a widow, was hired on at the A. Nash Company under the alias of \\"Hattie Clark.\\" She spent two weeks as an undercover factory worker, journaling her experiences‚Äîone of which was witnessing, along with a thousand of her co- workers assembled in the plant's cutting room, the marriage of Nash's son, William, to the company secretary, Bertha Fisher. About six months prior to Colton's journalistic investigation, a man by the name of John Sydell held up and robbed the A. Nash Company cashier of the plant's weekly payroll. When he was pronounced guilty, concern for Sydell's wife and four young children prompted a discussion between Nash and his employees on how they might be of service to the family. Colton was present at the factory meeting when it was decided Mrs. Sydell would be put on the company payroll at $20 per week, provided she agreed to use the money to make a good home for her children. And it was \\"Hattie Clark\\" that all six hundred workers present voted should deliver the money to Mrs. Sydell each week, and make sure that it was spent correctly. During this meeting, immediately following the vote, Colton revealed her true identity. Among other favorable observations, Colton wrote of Nash being opposed to overtime work. Having already reduced the workday to eight hours and the workweek to forty, he was studying ways to further reduce the hours of female workers, whom he claimed, \\"had the additional burdens of the home to carry.\\" Nash obtained permission to include Colton's article in his autobiography, which he would publish the following year. In it, Colton described a constant process of growth, development, and expansion‚Äîboth spiritual and material‚Äîas the greatest feature of what she called, \\"this remarkable experiment.\\" She reported that every change in economic or social policy in the factory had come either at a worker's suggestion, or through a discussion between employer and employee. Not all publicity that year was favorable, however. Survey contributor, S. Adele Shaw, provided an eyewitness account of shabby and unsanitary conditions in the Nash factory on East 8th. In an article appearing in the Survey's March eighteenth issue, Shaw cited overflowing trash receptacles, poor lighting, and odiferous plumbing problems. Though complaints about the facilities‚Äîespecially for the female workers‚Äîwere not without precedent, Shaw also pointed out that there was no mechanism for employee representation in management in the Nash shops, and that semi-annual mass meetings were, \\"without exception,\\" called by management, whose agenda was then imposed upon the workers. The latter report stands in stark contrast to Colton's, who described factory meetings as informal, as being called 'from time to time,\\" and most often \\"by one of the 'lesser members of the family.'\\" The A. Nash Company was a \\"true Industrial Democracy,\\" Colton wrote‚Äîone she had actually participated in. A special train was sent from Cincinnati to the National Association of Specialty Salesmen's annual convention at Cedar Point in July, bearing Nash (who was the association's president) and two hundred and fifty of Nash's employees. Delegations from New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were in attendance at the Sandusky gathering, with Nash the most prominent figure. Colton was in charge of the event's publicity. The year 1923 In early spring, it was reported that Nash had established a vegetarian cafeteria for his 2,100 employees, having hired a dietician from the Washington Institute to plan well-balanced meals that created \\"brains as well as brawn.\\" Though there is no evidence that Nash himself practiced abstaining from meat once he left the Adventist faith, he credited his parents' (both then in their mid-70s) longtime vegetarianism for their longevity. In July, Nash announced the 35-hour work week for women, stating that, \\"it was an insult to the Master himself to talk about building the kingdom of heaven on earth when women workers are bending over machines for forty hours a week,\\" and instead of reducing the wage scale, he established a minimum wage of fifty cents an hour. Before the year's end, Nash's autobiography, The Golden Rule in Business was published, with the final chapter, \\"Something Attempted, Something Done\\"‚Äîthe transcript of a speech he delivered to the student body of Harvard Business School four days before his manuscript was due to the publishers‚Äîincluded at the last minute. The following excerpts are from that speech: > *... there is a difference in the spiritual sense between \\"organization\\" and > \\"organism,\\" and I believe that in most of the organization work that we have > tried to do in this world we have made a mechanism out of it; and human > beings, who are spiritual beings, do not fit as cogs into a thing that is > worked out on an architect's plan... It doesn't work that way. *The > fundamental thing in industrial economics, as well as in all phases of human > relationships, is to adjust all conditions so as to develop human beings of > \\"full stature\\"... In other words, ability, energy, and wealth should be > devoted to the development of men and women. *I believe that any system of > economics or sociology or business teaching to be unsound that does not > start on this fundamental basis: that the men and women connected with it > are the important, the vital, asset of that business, and that their > development... is the important and the fundamental thing on which to build > any institution. *... in the philosophy of Jesus and in His philosophy, > alone, is centred the hope of the world. Remember, I am not talking about > any of the fifty-seven varieties of philosophy extant about Him; I am > talking about His philosophy, and therein lies all the difference. I am > talking about the marvelous revelation of sociology, psychology and theology > He gave the world, which He summed up, and put into one sentence... : > \\"Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye > even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\\" In that, and that > alone, lies the hope of mankind. The year 1924 In January, Nash received a call from a reporter who was covering the story of Cincinnati nurse, Olivia Stone, who, in a crime of passion had shot and killed her lover, Brooklyn lawyer, Ellis G. Kinkead. Stone was acquitted by a jury, but found the court of public opinion another matter altogether. Though a free woman, she was reduced to her last dollar and turned away from her friends and her profession; she told the reporter that there was \\"nothing left but to die.\\" \\"Send her to my office,\\" Nash responded, and he gave Stone a job as a visiting nurse for his factories. An article in a Bradford, Pennsylvania newspaper in October encouraged every employer and employee in the city to attend the first of four meetings of \\"unusual interest,\\" organized by the Board of Commerce. Nash was expected to lecture on how it was possible to combine an honest endeavor and a great spiritual principle, \\"and transform a group of common people into a most uncommon fellowship.\\" Nash had lowered prices, raised wages repeatedly, reduced both the workday and the workweek, and stabilized employment. And yet the money kept coming in. Knowing that his share of a stock dividend would soon make him a millionaire, Nash raised the question to the public; \\"Who had produced this wealth, [and] in consequence to whom did it belong?\\" Thousands upon thousands of letters poured in, \\"most of them begging letters,\\" Nash wrote, \\"some pathetic, some humorous, many ridiculous.\\" Father Keefer, a Catholic priest Nash had never met, stopped by his office and tried to convince Nash that it would be wrong in God's eyes were he to give the money away. In May, Nash distributed to his employees his share of a dividend (that would have paid him $1,200,000), transferring to them, in five years time, control of the company. Nash believed his employees were entitled to these profits because their labors had made the money; he felt, in fact, that he would be, \\"the arch fiend of the ages,\\" were he to personally appropriate the riches. There is very little mention of Nash's relationship with his parents beyond his early break with them. In September, 1924, however‚Äîto celebrate their fifty-fifth wedding anniversary‚ÄîEvermont and Rachel were photographed visiting their famous son, \\"for the first time in seven years.\\" The year 1925 In January, the J.C. Penney Company hosted a great Mercantile convention at the Ambassador Hotel in Atlantic City. Six special Pullman trains were required to carry the attendees from around the country to the three-day event. Nash was listed among the notable speakers, along with Mr. James Cash Penney. Addressing the Universalist Laymen's Association at New York's Hotel Commodore, also in January, Nash offered up a check for $1,000, stating he would add $20,000 more per year, for five years, if other churchmen of any denomination would raise $900,000. This fund was meant to advance the brotherhood movement in the United States, regardless of denomination or creed. Making a habit of attending all the sessions of the general religious conventions wherein he was invited to speak, Nash came to the conclusion that sectarianism seemed to be the universal law with churches. This perplexed him, prompting him to join the Universalists. He became a trustee of their general convention. Under Nash's leadership, the lay members of the Universalist Church, who believed that great opportunities for constructive spiritual progress existed in Turkey, gave $25,000, with the promise of $50,000 more each year for five years, to what would be known as the Turkish-American Club. Nash founded and endowed the Brotherhood of Man movement in Turkey with $100,000 of his own money, intended to promote amity between young Turks and their Christian neighbors. Missionary work was organized, having as its objective the brotherhood of man, without any one religious sect predominating. =How the union came= By 1925, the A. Nash Company had become the largest producer of direct-to-consumer clothing in America, doing $12,000,000 worth of business, and making history as the fastest growing industry the country had ever seen. One of the nation's best known orators, Nash was called \\"the most famous layman in the United States,\\"‚Äîhaving delivered addresses in nearly every state in the union. Invitations to speak at religious, civic, and industrial functions poured in, and as his company and workforce grew, Nash felt compelled to spend more and more of his time out in the field. Deprived of his personality and direct influence, morale in Nash's company began to suffer. Subordinate executives \\"failed to maintain either the standard of their chief's idealism, or the equity consequent upon its adoption,\\" and soon favoritism, discrimination, and shoddy workmanship reared their ugly heads. \\"Something of all this,\\" Roberts wrote, \\"Nash either knew or sensed.\\" So Nash decided to place his problems before a group of local ministers, explaining that it was impossible to provide the same mentoring and oversight‚Äîwith his payroll numbering in the thousands‚Äîas he had been able when his company was small. He asked the ministers to take whatever organization \\"the Church has for establishing the Kingdom of God in industry,\\" and go through his factories thoroughly to discover everything that is \\"not in harmony with the principles and teachings of Jesus.\\" When one of the ministers accused Nash of knowing full well the church had no such organization, Nash demanded of them, \\"What, then, is the job of the church?\\" Nash concluded that if organized religion couldn't do the job of helping him protect the interests and welfare of his workers, he would have to look elsewhere.\\" In February, Frank Rosenblum, general executive board member of the Amalgamated, met with general organizers, Jack Kroll, Emilio Grandinetti, and Celestine Goddard, to decide on a new method for organizing the Nash workers. Goddard was put in charge of a plan that included directing negative publicity toward the working conditions in Nash's factories. In July, in Olivet, Michigan, the claims of the Amalgamated were put before a council of churchmen by Hillman and the union's economic advisor, Leo Wolman, and as a result of this conference, the first effective contacts between Nash and the union were established. On December 1, in a private Washington, D.C. meeting that had been initiated by Hillman, Nash accused him of sponsoring the \\"guerilla warfare\\" the Joint Board had carried out against the A. Nash Company in the four years since their failed meeting in New York. Hillman not only denied this, he denied knowledge of the actions in question. Nash returned to Cincinnati armed with Hillman's written disavowal, which said, in part: > Some of those who represented us in Cincinnati, moved by excessive zeal and > often by ignorance, were led to make reckless and inaccurate statements > which put the organization in the light of denying those universal > principles of conduct embodied in the Golden Rule... The work of the > organized labor movement as the Amalgamated sees it, is to bring the > precepts of the Golden Rule into the daily working lives of the masses of > men and women. On Tuesday, December 8, four years to the day since his New York meeting with Hillman, Nash gathered his employees‚Äîmost of whom where anti-union‚Äîand urged them to join with the Amalgamated. The next day, A. Nash Company foremen and junior supervisors held anti-union meetings in the factories, whipping up unrest and uncertainty among the workers. On Thursday, December 10, in a move that attracted nationwide attention, Nash assembled his executive heads and all of his thousands of employees‚Äîmore than 80% of them female‚Äîfor a great mass meeting at the Shubert Theater in Cincinnati to hear Hillman make the case for the Amalgamated. Hillman's speech was at first met with approval, but when a company executive addressed the crowd, a great deal of animosity toward the union was exhibited. In a dramatic struggle Nash described as, \\"the supreme hour of his life,\\" he appealed to his employees. Addressing them as \\"Fellow-workers,\\" he challenged them, in part: \\"Are we to be pointed to as an example, and quoted as an argument, why avaricious organizations should be allowed to exploit their labour, and grind their dollars out of the very sweat and blood of our brothers and sisters in their factories; or shall we join with this great group of organized workers, who are striving to loose the bonds of wickedness, lift the burdens of the heavy-laden and let the oppressed go free?\\" He even went so far as to commit to his workers that if unionization did not turn out as Hillman had promised, Nash would personally ask them to rescind their decision. A vote was taken, and by the next day, with \\"three thousand new members in the ranks of the labor movement... the seas subsided, calm again reigned supreme, and the union was established.\\" On Friday, December 11, a luncheon in honor of Nash and Hillman‚Äîattended by more than seventy of the city's foremost business, civic, educational, and religious leaders‚Äîwas held at Cincinnati's Business Men's Club. The faith the two leaders had shown one another was praised, along with their faith in democracy, and, \\"the fine example they had shown to American industry.\\" Addressing the group, Nash expressed fear of the deadening effect of organization as an end in itself, rather than a means to an end. Though he believed the Golden Rule would one day be enough, with industrial conditions as they were, experience had persuaded him that the trade-union was, \\"an essential means to brotherhood.\\" United States courts of appeals judge, Julian Mack, appealed to the group to marshal public opinion behind an experiment he regarded as, \\"the highest promise to American industry and to industrial democracy throughout the world.\\" =Last two years= 1926 opened with nearly four thousand regular workers on Nash's payroll, and a sales force of about two thousand scattered around the country. On January 7, the agreement between the Amalgamated and the A. Nash Company was ratified at Cincinnati's Emery Auditorium. The Amalgamated's experts, drawn from 140,000 of its most experienced workers, advised Nash on the technical details of production as well as the routing layout of his factories. And the union made many other changes that helped Nash stabilize his business, increase his profit margin, and accumulate reserves to safeguard his company from future economic vicissitudes. Jeffrey Wattles, author of, The Golden Rule, wrote: \\"The union's technical competence, which Nash had previously rejected as deadening, proved most helpful.\\" Wattles went on to explain that, \\"many techniques of scientific management that [Nash] had scorned as mere mechanical substitutes for human cooperation were introduced, and he found that they in fact constituted the very extension and application of the golden rule itself.\\" On December 26, 1926, Nash published the first of fifty-two issues of The Nash Journal, a weekly magazine filled with editorials, inspirational quotes and tidbits of wisdom, business advice, company happenings, and news of the world‚Äîincluding much about Turkey, brotherhood, race relations, religious tolerance, home and family life, and women's rights. Through its pages, Roberts wrote, Nash, \\"could find free expression.\\" In answer to the anticipated question, \\"What is this?\\" Nash had the following printed on the cover of the magazine's first issue: > In dedicating the journal to the task of making Universal Brotherhood a > reality in this world, we shall constantly urge: *First‚Äî That the strong and > the wise shall help the weak and the unwise, until the weak and unwise shall > become strong and wise. *Second‚Äî We shall uncompromisingly urge and work for > equality of opportunity for all, and special privilege to none. *Third‚Äî We > dedicate this Journal to the principle of opposition to war, and dominance > merely by power of force, whether that force be military or economical, > whether in industrial relationships or internal relationships. *Fourth‚Äî > While taking no partisan stand in politics, we shall not hesitate to ally > all of our resources with any political movement that proves itself to be > for the furtherance of the ideas and principles for which we stand. *Fifth‚Äî > The Journal shall always plead for and exercise tolerance in the field of > religion. We shall not interest ourselves in changing the religion of any > man. We shall constantly urge that any man live up to the highest ideals of > his religion. In the second issue, Nash wrote one of the journal's most frequently quoted articles, in which he said: > Whatever success has come to The A. Nash Company, in living the Golden Rule, > has come, because there has been just enough business knowledge to enable us > to live it to just that degree, and whenever we have failed in exercising > the very highest and keenest business judgment on a truly ethical basis, it > has been because we did not have sufficient insight to understand our > obligation measured by the Golden Rule. In other words, perfect and > infallible living of the Golden Rule would require infallible mentality and > undaunted courage. This we do not claim... However, we are more and more > convinced of the immutability and the infallibility of the Golden Rule, as > we approach nearer and nearer to the ability to live it. The two years following unionization of Nash's company were the busiest in his life. He labored fervently, giving countless addresses at innumerable functions. \\"The tax upon his physical resources,\\" Roberts wrote, \\"was appalling.\\" In the summer of 1927, it was Nash's friends who convinced him to seek medical care. Soon it seemed the crises had been averted, but it later came to light that Nash had secretly continued suffering agonizing attacks of angina pectoris. In late October, Nash appointed Herbert R. Bloch chairman of his entire organization and named ten more men to his board of management‚Äîone of them, Jack Kroll, business agent of the Amalgamated. Gathering the eleven together, he told them that he would be going on a \\"long vacation,\\" and effective immediately, gave them complete authority to act in his stead. Death and afterward On Saturday, October 29‚Äîless than a week after forming his management board‚ÄîNash, at the insistence of his physicians, was taken to Cincinnati's Good Samaritan Hospital. The next day he claimed to be feeling better, expressing hope that he would soon resume his business duties. But later that same day, Sunday, October 30, he was seized by a fatal heart attack. On November 2, funeral services, attended by \\"a great throng,\\" were held at the Masonic Temple in Walnut Hills. \\"It was difficult‚Äî\\" observed Roberts, \\"well-nigh impossible‚Äîfor large numbers of those present to even approximately realize that a personality so impressive and as vigorous... should have been so swiftly silenced.\\" Only those who had been near and dear to Nash participated in the service proper, among them, Joseph Fort Newton, who said of his friend; \\"Arthur Nash was a man lovable in his manliness, altogether admirable in his domestic relations, loyal in his friendships, prophetic in his citizenship, gentle in strength, wise and winsome in counsel, exquisite in sympathy, rich in insight, broad and tolerant in understanding, a true man.\\" Also speaking at the funeral, the Amalgamated's president, Sidney Hillman, said of Nash: > He belonged to that small group of employers who believe that the human > material is a vastly different thing from the mere physical material with > which they work... When recognition of the union in his shop became > possible, he rested neither night nor day until he had inspired confidence, > both in the Nash shops, and in their union representatives. He gave his > loyalty to collective bargaining with every fiber of his being, and such > bargaining meant just one thing‚Äîabsolute and unqualified relations of trust > and honor with the union... It is true that he preached in order to spread > the gospel of service he believed in. But he did more. More important than > all his principles... was the fact that he practiced what he preached... > Arthur was a true humanitarian, to whom the welfare of all his fellows was a > matter of vital personal concern. He has left humanity richer for his having > lived, and yet, in another sense, poorer for his having gone from us. A > spirit, however, has gone out from the man that Death has not power to > still. What Arthur Nash believed in and tried to achieve has not died, and > the only fitting way for us to honor his memory is to strive tirelessly to > realize the higher civilization which he longed so much to see before he > closed his eyes on this earthy scene. When a bank trust officer applied to administer Nash's estate in probate court on the 9th of November, it was disclosed that Nash had left no will. Nash's personal worth at the time of his death was estimated at about one million dollars. Without a will, under Ohio law Maude would receive one third, the remainder to be divided among other heirs. The last issue of The Nash Journal, \\"In Memoriam,\\" was published on November 28, 1927, with transcripts of eulogies and many other glowing tributes to Nash‚Äîof which the following snippets are a sample‚Äîgracing its pages: > *He proved in his factory what he somehow knew, that Catholic, Protestant, > Jew, and unbeliever know alike how to love, how to be friends, how to stand > by one another in a great undertaking. Our differences are theological and > racial rather than of the soul. Never have racial and religious prejudice > been so rebuked... than by the Nash experiment. ‚ÄîWorth M. Tippy, of the > Federal Council of Churches *No one of his friends can remember an instance > where he showed a love of money for its own sake.

Roberts *The words he spoke, the deeds he lived, > are recorded in the eternal ethers. A new invention will in time reproduce > them, in film... ‚ÄîMay Cornell Stoiber, Unity Center leader In 1929, the September fifth issue of the Kokomo Tribune carried a story reporting the sale by Ralph Nash, his mother, and his two siblings of more than two million dollars worth of A. Nash Company stock. The stock transfer, which occurred less than two months before the stock market crash of 1929, passed complete control of the company to the buyer, Cincinnati brokers, W.E. Fox & Co. Claiming the purchase was made as an investment, the new owners denied plans to merge Nash's company with another manufacturing house, or to offer Nash company stock‚Äîwhose total value was estimated at about four million dollars at the time‚Äîto the public. Philosophical and religious views * At the beginning of his business venture‚Äîthough Nash thought the Golden Rule right‚Äîhe saw it as impractical idealism, and was skeptical that a business could be successfully operated on that principle. When prosperity came, Nash believed he had been given too much credit, and that his real role had been merely to provide an opportunity for the operation of the Golden Rule in industry. * Nash came to regard the last clause of Matthew 7:12, \\"for this is the law and the prophets,\\" as the most important phrase of the verse, believing Jesus was in effect stating; \\"this is the beginning and ending of my gospel.\\" The Golden Rule, for Nash, summed up the whole of Jesus' teachings. * \\"The application of the philosophy of Jesus, as it is summed up in the Golden Rule is the solution to the troubles of the world, whether industrial, political, or spiritual,\\" Nash stated before a Presbyterian conference in Milwaukee. He went on to call strikes, \\"a social cancer caused by oppression in industry,\\" pointing out that industry placed supreme emphasis, \\"where supreme value does not reside.\\" * When asked, \\"Do you think I could apply the Golden Rule in my business?\\" Nash answered, \\"You might just as well resolve to fly through the air without an airplane as to resolve to live the Golden Rule without proper equipment. Indispensable to that equipment is the right attitude toward one's fellows. So long as they are 'dubs' and 'foreigners,' it is impossible.\\" * Nash wrote; \\"The Golden Rule is the divine law governing human relationships, accepted by all religions and proclaimed by all prophets and teachers of every creed. It is the only infallible, workable, industrial and economic law in the universe today.\\" * \\"The laws of God governing human relationships,\\" Nash stated, \\"are as fixed and unalterable as the law of gravitation itself.\\" * Nash diagnosed the trouble with Christianity as sectarianism he described as, \\"denominational cussedness rather than consciousness.\\" He told of preachers, when he was a boy, who, rather than devoting their time to discoursing on brotherly love, gave most of their efforts to defending their own church's creed, while harshly criticizing the creeds of others, \\"and the more that they lambasted other creeds,\\" Nash said, \\"the more it pleased their congregations.\\" * Nash's anti-war views are exemplified in The Nash Journal, article entitled, \\"The Abolition of War\\": \\"... all that is necessary to abolish war is that the nations of each should come together and unanimously agree that this horrible wasting of lives and economic values should never again be resorted to as a method of settling international difficulties, because it settles nothing.\\" * Nash did not believe in time clocks. * Referring to those whom he said, \\"take human beings and make machines of them to speed up production,\\" Nash told a convention of southern business men, \\"Build a wall higher than Babylon around your city, and write on it 'Efficiency engineers keep out!'\\" * Nash regarded the accumulation of great wealth as incompatible with living by the Golden Rule. * The Dictionary of American Biography printed of Nash: \\"[He was] a shrewd business man, with a flair for leadership and a full understanding of the value of the publicity secured by his speeches, Nash was by nature and training a sincere and aggressive evangelist. To him the \\"Golden Rule in Business\\" was a religion, and not merely a successful advertising slogan.\\" * Arthur Nash: \\"If we can't have clothes without taking the mothers of the next generation, we can go without them [clothes, that is].\\" *Nash forever insisted that no system or group action could take the place of individual effort. He believed that the will to serve, rather than the will to govern and control, must be the individual aim and motive of all group members, or else end up with \\"nothing other than an aggregation of illiberality and the pooled selfishness of units.\\" * Philip Roberts: \\"The truth of the whole matter lay in the moral rather than the industrial stratum of the situation.\\" Notes/Further reading *Boyles, Cheryl Suffelette (2013).

Personal life and education  The eldest of three children, Reza Moghadam was born in Borojerd in Western Iran on 4 May 1962 and raised in Tehran. His family moved to London when the Islamic revolution broke out in 1979. In 1982 he was admitted to Oxford University where he studied mathematics at Magdalen College. While there, he was elected president of the student union (Junior Common Room) and created and ran the first Magdalen College Arts Festival. Following a master's degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science, he went on to the University of Warwick for his PhD in Economics; his doctoral thesis was on wage determination. He is a passionate cyclist and a supporter of the Chelsea Football Club.  Early career  While studying for his PhD, Moghadam taught economics at the Universities of Warwick as well as in London and Bristol. During this time he worked with Colin Carter on the renovation of the LSE‚Äôs Phillips Machine,of the Restored Phillips Machine, 29 June 1989 url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3983651036 a 60-year- old hydraulic model of the British economy used to demonstrate visually the workings of open economy macroeconomic theory.

From 1990 to 1992, he worked as an Economist for Coopers and Lybrand, focusing on labor market, regulatory and privatization issues.  International Monetary Fund career  Moghadam joined the IMF in 1992 in its elite Economist Program. Moghadam started in the European Department, where he got to deal with the fall-out from the collapse of the communist states, German reunification, and the implosion of the exchange-rate mechanism. He then transferred to the Asia and Pacific Department in 1997 just as Thailand devalued its currency, the first domino of the Asian Crisis.

When de Rato quit in 2007, incoming boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn, asked Moghadam to stay on. In September 2008, just as the Lehman crisis was gathering steam, Moghadam was appointed head of the pivotal Policy Development and Review Department (PDR), which was turned by Strauss Kahn into the Strategy, Policy and Review (SPR) department tasked with spearheading the modernization of the institution. para. 10 \\"Dominique Strauss-Kahn is publicly portrayed as the man who transformed the Fund.

Moghadam is a sort of secretary general for the Fund. He introduces internal and external reforms and proposes new groups and strategies.\\" In November 2011, with the euro-area crisis deepening, Christine Lagarde who had taken over the helm of the IMF in July, asked Moghadam to become the Director of the European Department. and The change garnered praise from many analysts who saw it as a move to heighten the IMF‚Äôs profile in dealing with the worsening crisis in Europe. \\"He [Moghadam] is seen as a very credible and powerful insider,\\" Eswar Prasad, a former IMF official and a senior fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington, told the Reuters news agency. \\"It shows that the IMF intends to be much more assertive in playing a prominent role in Europe and Reza Moghadam is somebody who is seen as being able to move the Fund to that more aggressive position.\\" From then on, he was the key architect of the Fund‚Äôs strategy in dealing with crises in Greece, Ireland,The Irish Times, IMF Wanted Senior Bondholder Bail In for Ireland, Suzanne Lynch, 3 Feb 2014, url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/imf-wanted-senior-bondholder- bail-in-for-ireland-1.1676854 Portugal, Cyprus and later Ukraine; he was also at the forefront of the policy dialogue with Italy and the Euro-area.

Honoring African-American soldiers and sailors from St. Mary's County who served in the Union Army during the Civil War. More than 700 African-American soldiers served, including many men who had escaped slavery Photo by Potomac Sun Photography The United States Colored Troops Memorial Statue is a memorial to the more than 700 African-American soldiers and sailors from St. Mary's County, Maryland who served in the Union forces during the American Civil War. It is located in the city of Lexington Park, Maryland. The memorial was completed and dedicated in 2012. The memorial includes an educational kiosk with a written history and also features two African- American men, William H. Barnes and James H. Harris, from St. Mary's County who received the Medal of Honor. A photograph of William H. Barnes is included. History This statue is the centerpiece of the memorial. It shows a USCT soldier in full battle dress, as he would look marching between engagements. The service of USCT soldiers and sailors was vital to the success of Union forces in the war and would ultimately contribute to the liberation of all enslaved peoples of St. Mary's County and the United States as a whole. It would also lead to the preservation of the Union and the extension of its founding principles to all of its citizens.Photo by Potomac Sun Photography =Soldiers and sailors= About 700 African-American soldiers from the county served on the Union side during the war. These included many men who escaped slavery and joined the Union cause. There were also many free Black citizens of the county, mostly tenant farmers, who also served. White soldiers from all walks of life in the county served as well. =Recruitment= Most men were recruited by the Union Army at special stations in St. Mary's County, which offered freedom to slaves who volunteered for service. Many in the county risked escape, regardless of the risk of incurring severe punishment from plantation owners, and signed up for military duty. Many free African Americans from the county, many of whom were tenant farmers or sharecroppers, also enlisted. A number of White county residents enlisted as well. Together, their service would ultimately contribute to the liberation of all enslaved peoples of St. Mary's County and the United States as a whole. =Medal of Honor recipients= Two African-American St. Mary's County men who served, William H. Barnes and James H. Harris, had both been free tenant farmers before the war. They had both volunteered for service in the Union Army. Both saw heavy fighting and each was awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm (also called the \\"Battle of New Market Heights\\"). They served in the 38th United States Colored Infantry regiment alongside other St. Mary's County men, including many who had escaped slavery. =Memorial dedication= The memorial was dedicated in 2012. The dedication was officiated by Congressman Steny Hoyer, former Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives. Officials from St. Mary's County, including St. Mary's County Commissioner Dan Raley and officials from the nearby Patuxent River Naval Air Station were in attendance as well.

It was originally established by Arash Farboud as Farboud Limited in 1999 and changed name in 2006. History The company began developing the Farboud GT in 1999 under the name Farboud Ltd. This was launched at The Autosport Show held at the Birmingham NEC in 2001. He went on to design the Farboud GTS which was officially launched at the British Motorshow in London in 2004. At that time Chris Marsh was working with Arash as a Sales Representative. His background was that he was the son of Jen Marsh who founded Marcos cars with Frank Costin (Marsh+Costin=Marcos). Marsh became enthusiastic about the Farboud GTS and Arash subsequently granted him a license to use the shape of the car and assist with the development in exchange for shares in the new car company. Marsh subsequently simplified the design by substituting the Audi RS4 based racing engine with a Ford V6. He also changed some cosmetic features including the doors, windows and interior parts. After a dispute in 2005, Marsh renamed the car \\"The Farbio\\". This was to announce the Farboud car link to \\"biofuel\\" and fitted more with the brand rework. He originally attempted to call the car \\"The Fangio\\", but there was push-back from the deceased Formula 1 drivers' Argentine family regarding renumeration. Arash sold his shares of Farbio to Michael Simmonds. Arash continued as 100% shareholder of Farboud Ltd. This later became Arash Motor Co. The design and concept was later sold to Laurence Tomlinson of Ginetta fame who kept the design and renamed the car the G50. Models Farbio GTS, production model at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2005 Farbio GTS 350 2016 Arash AF10 Arash AF8 Cassini at the Geneva Motor Show 2016 =Farboud GT= The Farboud GT was the company's first model, announced in 2002 at the Autosport International show in Birmingham.

Three cars were built before the design was sold to Farbio Sports Cars and production started in 2007 with the car sold as the Farbio GTS. Following the merging of Farbio with Ginetta, the GTS was further developed as the Ginetta F400. =Arash AF10= In 2009, Arash displayed the AF10, featuring a Chevrolet Corvette-sourced 7.0-litre V8 engine producing at least 500bhp. The car was not put into production but Arash later revealed a revised model in 2016 with a hybrid drivetrain and a horsepower claim of 2080 HP. =Arash AF8= The AF8 was designed by Arash and revealed at the Geneva Motor Show 2016. It featured a carbon/steel tubed chassis and a mid-engined 7.0-litre V8 engine producing 505bhp. It later went up the hill at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2015 and 2016.

(His sister's daughter, Alexandra Creel Goelet was co-owner, until his death, and is now sole owner.) He was the 16th Lord of the Manor. Early life Gardiner was born in New York on February 25, 1911. Gardiner was raised by a single mother, and continued to live with her, in Manhattan. He attended St. George's School in Newport, Rhode Island. He attended Columbia University and graduated in 1934. He then attended New York University School of Law. Career He served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II. Gardiner worked on Wall Street, for the Empire Trust Company and owned a 42-acre shopping center in Islip, New York. =Gardiner family properties= He and his sister Alexandra Gardiner Creel inherited Gardiner's Island from their aunt, Sarah Diodati Gardiner, when she died in 1953. Gardiner had long-running disputes with his sister, and her daughter, Alexandra Creel Goelet. Goelet and her husband were conservationists, while Gardiner was an enthusiastic hunter. From 1953, when Gardiner and his sister inherited the Island, until 1977, the Island's operating costs had been covered by a trust set up by the aunt from whom they inherited the property. Due to their disputes, Gardiner refused to contribute to the taxes and other costs of maintaining the property‚Äìwhich, at that time, were more than $1 million per year. He didn't contribute for over a decade. They, in turn, went to court to bar him from visiting the property. In 1971 Representative Otis Pike proposed a bill to expropriate Gardiners Island , to turn it into a Federal National Monument. Gardiner complained that the proposal to expropriate his family's property was unfair, when the Rockefeller family had been allowed to continue to own their Pocantico Hills estate. Gardiner also inherited Sagtikos Manor, a 10-acre heritage property on Long Island. Gardiner inherited the property, which had been in his family since the 18th century, in the 1930s. Gardiner and his wife Eunice used the property as their primary residence for several years, early in their marriage. In 1963, when the Sagtikos Manor Historical Society was founded, the Gardiners stopped using it as their primary residence, let the Historical Society use part of the structure, but insisted the Historical Society reserve a suite for him. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in the 1970s. In 1986 Gardiner transferred ownership of the property to the nonprofit Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation. Today, Sagtikos Manor stands as a small museum rich in historical value to the American Revolution and its era onward. Personal life In 1961, Gardiner was married to Eunice Bailey Oakes (1928‚Äì2011), a former British model, at St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Eunice, who was previously married to William Pitt Oakes (a son of Sir Harry Oakes, William died of an overdose at 28), was significantly younger than he was, but the couple's marriage yielded no children. In the 1980s Gardiner tried to adopt a distant relative, so he would have an heir who could continue inherit his share of the Island, and keep it in the Gardiner name. But those efforts failed, since he was looking for a relative who was already wealthy, who, nevertheless, would agree to his conditions as to how Gardiner's Island was managed, after his death. His niece, Alexandra Creel Goelet, had already inherited his sister's half of the estate, and inherited Gardiner's half upon his death through court. Gardiner and his niece were estranged. They traversed arduous litigation toward one another over the Gardiner Estate's fund and ownership of equity such as Gardiner's Island and Sagtikos Manor which had originally meant to be preserved for the family's history. In popular culture The long running dispute between Gardiner and his niece formed part of the background to Chrystle Fiedler's 2015 mystery novel Garden of Death.

A long- lasting system, Genevieve was the first one to track across all three northern Pacific basins since Hurricane Dora in 1999. Genevieve developed from a tropical wave into the eighth tropical storm of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season well east-southeast of Hawaii on July 25. However, increased vertical wind shear caused it to weaken into a tropical depression by the following day and degenerate into a remnant low on July 28. Late on July 29, the system regenerated into a tropical depression, but it weakened into a remnant low again on July 31, owing to vertical wind shear and dry air. The remnants redeveloped into a tropical depression and briefly became a tropical storm south of Hawaii on August 2, yet it weakened back into a tropical depression soon afterwards. Late on August 5, Genevieve re-intensified into a tropical storm, and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the next day when undergoing rapid deepening because of favorable conditions. Early on August 7, Genevieve strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane, shortly before it crossed the International Date Line and was reclassified as a typhoon, also becoming the thirteenth named storm of the 2014 Pacific typhoon season. Late on the same day, Genevieve reached peak intensity while it was located west-southwest of Wake Island. Typhoon Genevieve started to gradually weaken at noon on August 8, and stronger vertical wind shear provided by a TUTT cell began to weaken the system further on August 9. The typhoon crossed 30¬∞ north at noon on August 10 and weakened to a severe tropical storm soon afterwards, because of unfavorable sea surface temperature and expanding subsidence. Genevieve weakened into a tropical storm on August 11 and a tropical depression the following day, as its deep convection diminished.  Meteorological history  =Origin and regeneration= The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a tropical wave associated with a few showers and thunderstorms, moving westward off the coast of northern Central America on July 17. Four days later, thunderstorm activity became more concentrated; by July 22, the area of low-pressure became better organized. On July 23, the NHC noted that the system could become a tropical depression within the next two days; however, they also noted that wind shear could increase within a couple of days. Following an increase of deep convection developing near the center as well as the collection of ASCAT data showing an area of tropical storm-force winds, the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Genevieve on July 25. Shortly thereafter, the system attained its initial peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h). Tropical Storm Genevieve at its initial peak intensity on July 25 Shortly afterward, increased wind shear took its toll on the system, causing Genevieve to lose its organization as it continued westward, under the influence of a subtropical ridge and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. After the low-level center of circulation was exposed and became separated from the deep convection, the NHC subsequently downgraded it to a tropical depression on July 26. Although deep convection increased near the center early on the next day, Genevieve continued to battle westerly shear when crossing 140¬∞W, moving into the waters monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). Due to the lack of deep convection, the CPHC indicated that Genevieve had become a post-tropical remnant low early on July 28, as only a low-level cloud swirl remained. However, the CPHC noted the possibility of re- development since shear was forecast to decrease. Roughly 36 hours later, the remnants of Genevieve regenerated into a tropical depression to the southeast of the main Hawaiian Islands. The system briefly became better organized on July 30, prompting the CPHC to forecast the storm would re-intensify into a tropical storm. However, by the end of the day, the low-level circulation center had become displaced to the east of the deep convection due to increased southeasterly shear and infiltration of dry air. By 21:00 UTC July 31, the CPHC reported that Genevieve had once again degenerated to a remnant low, as only an isolated area of deep convection remained west of the center. =Intensification and peak intensity= The remnants of Genevieve continued to travel in a generally westward direction, moving into an environment more conducive for tropical development, and on the afternoon of August 2, Genevieve regenerated into a tropical depression, as the storm reacquired deep convection and its upper-level outflow pattern improved. By 21:00 UTC the same day, Genevieve reacquired tropical storm intensity, continuing to travel westward around the subtropical ridge to its north, but only six hours later, the CPHC downgraded Genevieve into a tropical depression. Deep convection near the center waxed and waned several times, but Genevieve failed to re- intensify. After moving south-southwest, Genevieve turned west-northwest on August 4 as it continued to track around the ridge to its north. Despite moderate wind shear, convection soon wrapped around the southeastern side of the low-level circulation. By 21:00 UTC on August 5, the CPHC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, despite continued wind shear. Wind shear quickly decreased, triggering a period of rapid intensification. By the afternoon of August 6, Genevieve intensified to a low-end Category 1 hurricane; the system also developed a central dense overcast and well-organized banding around the newly-developed eye. Traversing over very warm ocean temperatures, the intensification rate accelerated that evening. Based on advanced Dvorak technique estimates of as well as the presence of a very well-defined eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops, the CPHC upgraded the hurricane into Category 4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale early on the next day. Infrared loop of Genevieve after it crossed the International Date Line Genevieve crossed the International Date Line at 06:00 UTC on August 7, entering the area of responsibility of the RSMC Tokyo operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Thus, the JMA immediately recognized Genevieve as a typhoon with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 115 mph (185 km/h). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also upgraded Genevieve to a super typhoon, based on the compact and symmetric ring of uniform convection embedded with a eye, as well as excellent poleward outflow into the strong tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) positioned to the north and northeast. Only six hours later, the JTWC reported that Genevieve had reached Category 5 status with one-minute sustained winds at 160 mph (260 km/h), when a microwave imagery revealed a diameter eyewall with a convective band over the south quadrant. As Genevieve continued to remain in a favorable environment with radial outflow and low vertical wind shear, the JMA indicated that the typhoon about 760 mi (1220 km) east-southeast of Wake Island had reached its peak intensity late on August 7, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 125 mph (205 km/h). =Demise= During the morning of August 8, Genevieve started to track northward along the western periphery of a deep- layered subtropical ridge positioned to the east and northeast. Although the typhoon remained compact at noon, more fragmented deep convective banding revealed that Genevieve had begun a weakening trend. As the result, the JTWC downgraded Genevieve to a typhoon late on the same day, due to warmer convection surrounding the system. Early on August 9, Genevieve accelerated north-northeastward, and it began to encounter increasing vertical wind shear of 35 mph (55 km/h) with subsidence along the western periphery and weakening outflow into the TUTT. Therefore, the eye of the typhoon became cloud-filled, while the deepest convection around the core was also becoming warmer. The system began to track north-northwestward in the afternoon, when the cold dense overcast has decreased in size and become less symmetric. Severe Tropical Storm Genevieve on August 11 Genevieve reformed a eye with more symmetric and organized convection for short time early on August 10, but the eye disappeared very soon as the system elongated more. Upper-level analysis indicated a complex environment‚Äî an anticyclone located to the southeast, a TUTT cell to the west, and a second anticyclone to the north. The TUTT cell and the first anticyclone caused strong upper-level southwestern flow and moderate vertical wind shear over the system, but the issues were offset by the quick speed of the typhoon. Tracking northwestward, Genevieve crossed 30¬∞N at noon and began to encounter unfavorable sea surface temperatures less than 79 ¬∞F (26 ¬∞C). At the same time, a digging trough was expanding the region of subsidence which isolated the core from the tropical moisture along the equatorward periphery. Later, deep convection along the tightly-wrapped low- level circulation center of the typhoon rapidly diminished as dry air surrounded the system. Late on August 10, the JMA downgraded Genevieve to a severe tropical storm about 670 mi (1,080 km) west-northwest of Midway Atoll, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm early on the next day. Dry air, cool ocean temperatures and a rapid weakening of the linkage to tropical moisture made deep convection over the storm almost completely dissipate. This process was hastened by the disintegration of the TUTT cell which had helped to enhance equatorward outflow. Under the combination of many unfavorable environmental factors, the JMA downgraded the rapidly weakening system to a tropical storm, when it started to move west-northwestward and slowed down at noon. Owing to diminished convection associated with a weak low-level circulation center, the JTWC issued its final warning and downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression late on the same day. After the JMA downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 12, the system drifted westward and then northwestward very slowly until it accelerated northeastward late on August 13. The JMA reported that Genevieve had dissipated as a tropical depression before noon on August 14; however, the Ocean Prediction Center indicated that this post-tropical cyclone crossed the International Date Line and entered the Central North Pacific Ocean again late on the same day. The remnants of Genevieve were eventually absorbed by another extratropical cyclone before noon on August 15.

The first broke out on 26 May near the Rangoon docks. It spread to nearby districts with high Indian populations and resulted in over one hundred killed and about one thousand injured. The second, a prison riot, began on 24 June in Rangoon Central Jail, where the staff was predominantly Indian and the inmates overwhelmingly Burman. The riots were overshadowed by the Saya San rebellion that erupted in December that year. In early May 1930‚Äîin the midst of the Great Depression‚ÄîIndian dockworkers in Rangoon went on strike for increased wages. Burman labourers were brought in to break the strike, but the port became congested. An agreement was reached with the Indians to raise their wages, whereupon the Burmans were dismissed. As they returned to work the Indians jeered the outgoing Burmans and violence ensued. For days Burman mobs, often composed of toughs imported from other neighbourhoods, roamed about for Indians, who barricaded themselves in their homes and, in one case, in the local lunatic asylum. Order was only restored when the Rangoon garrison, the Cameron Highlanders, was sent in. According to British colonial government sources, roughly 120 people of Indian origin were killed and more than 900 were injured. However, more recent analyses estimate that more than 200 were killed and 2,000 injured. The majority of all killed and wounded was Indian. The riot in the jail was a lesser mirror image of the dockyard riots. The Indian prison staff killed, mainly by gunshot, 34 inmates (out of 2,000) and injured 60 others.

(born Su Pheaktra Bonnyface Chanmongkhon, July 20, 1974, Cambodia) is a Cambodian-Swiss blues musician and harmonica player. Early life In 1978, his family fled Cambodia, pursued by the Khmer Rouge, and took refuge in the jungle near the Thai border. After three days and three nights running, with no food, they finally found safety in Thailand. In 1979, with the help of Catholic sisters, the family arrived in Fribourg, Switzerland, and asked for political asylum. He started school in 1980 and fought to be accepted and to find a place in the community. From 1988 to 1991, when he was in high school, he started to like the harmonica and country music: \\"this time I copied and listened to many country CDs.\\" The school organized a day of entertainment and \\"hired two bluesmen including one playing the harmonica and the blues came like that. My first CDs were by John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters and Little Walter, Jimmy Reed, Otis Rush, and all the old black bluesmen of the 50s.\\" He left school and from 1992 to 1995 trained in making pastries and candy, an activity that allowed him to support himself, but music was playing an increasingly important role in his life. Career In 1992 he formed his first band, Bonny B. and Spirit of the Blues. They played their first gig two months after they met. Then followed Born to Blues in 1994, the Bonny B. Blues Band in 1996 and the Bonny B. Band in 1998. On the side, he also played in a duo with his brother Michael on guitar. He was also engaged as a sideman with Tom Cat Blake, JC Little and Kevin Flynn, among others. With these various formations, he played 50 to 100 concerts a year in Switzerland and abroad. In 1994 he opened a school for harmonica and singing. In May 1998, Bonny decided to go to Chicago in search of the blues: \\"I had to travel there as a pilgrimage.\\" Speaking almost no English, he jammed with Louisiana Red, Buddy Guy, Jimmy Johnson, Kenny Neal, John Primer and Bernard Allison at clubs such as the legendary Blue Chicago, Buddy Guy's Legend and Koko Taylor's. Short of money, he played in bars and on the streets of Chicago to pay for his return ticket. Albums and concerts In 1999, Bonny decided to record an album. He teamed up with his old friend, drummer Sal Lombardo, and guitarist Laurent Poget. This collaboration resulted in the album Cambodia, released in Switzerland in March 2000. In March 2001, he released the album Something's Wrong in Europe on Dixiefrog. It is also found in several blues compilations (notably Levis, Blues 2002 compilation). In 2002, he worked with several American artists, including Vic Pitts, Michael J. Robinson, Jesse James King, Sugar Blue, Mark Woodward, Napoleon Washington. In March 2003, he released his second album, If This Is Life, and signed with Universal Music and its sponsor Hohner Harmonica. \\"We told him that he is one of the best harmonica players and singers from Switzerland. Bonny B. has no equal to breathe the warmth of blues concerts in Switzerland or abroad.\\" By October 2004, Bonny B. was performing 120 concerts per year. He signed his 1000th contract and traveled throughout Switzerland. In the spring of 2005, he released his third album, I Got the Blues, on the Dixiefrog label and Hard Board. In 2005, he released his debut album Cambodia (Something's Wrong) in the U.S. and Canada with the Dixiefrog label. Claude Nobs discovered the last album by Bonny B. and asked him to play at the Montreux Jazz Festival with Alice Cooper. On the side, he decided to explore the blues in public schools and colleges throughout western Switzerland, as part of educational concerts on the history and evolution of the blues. In 2006, he planned to open a school in Cambodia for underprivileged children, financed by the sale of his latest album and concert support. During his \\"James Brown Tour\\" in 2007 (when he was nicknamed the Asian James Brown by the press), he called himself Bonny B. Brown, in honor of one of its masters. Other achievements Construction of the school in Cambodia began in November 2007. He has garnered support from his concerts in the sum of 35 000 Swiss francs to complete the project. In 2008, Bonny B. was hired by Hohner Harmonica as manager of harmonica workshops in all its music stores in Switzerland. He formed his first gospel choir, the IRF-Gospel Singers and organized gospel singing on Stage Giez. Bonny B. was hired as a teacher at the harmonica blues school ETM in Geneva . On February 28, 2009, on a bet, he became the only harmonica player in the world to play the harmonica for 24 hours nonstop (a Guinness world record), to raise money for his school in Cambodia. ALso in 2009, the first Bonny B. Blues Club opened in Fribourg, where he organized blues concerts with American artists. His second blues club, the Rock Bottom Blues & Jazz Club, opened in Giez in 2010, in collaboration with Fabienne Decker. In March 2010, Bonny B. recorded his eighth album, which was produced in collaboration with Bob Margolin. He created a blues festival in Giez, held on September 10‚Äì12 of that year. In 2011, he toured with the first edition of the Blues Legend Tour, with Finis Tasby, Bob Margolin, Dave Riley and Bob Stroger. He also released the album Bonny B. Live at Blues Club Fribourg.

Along with her contemporaries Rukhshana, Qamar Gula and Afsana, she is often cited as one of the first female singers who entered the Afghan music scene professionally.http://www.kabulnath.de/Sal-e- Nohum/Shoumare_206/zabih%20mahdi.html Early life Zheela () was born in Kabul, Afghanistan to Sardar Mohammed Kabir Khan, a banker. When she was five years old, her mother died. Zheela had three sisters, one of whom, Sara, married the Afghan singer Ustad Jalil Zaland. Zheela developed an interest in singing at a young age, and by her teen years, was singing at family events. She completed eighth grade at Zarghona Middle School at which point she was pressed to become a singer at the encouragement of her social circle who had attended her performances. Her father, a progressive who had an admiration for music and the arts, was also supportive and became the catalyst for the initiation of her singing career. Career Zheela entered the Afghan music industry at that age of 14. With the support of her brother-in-law Ustad Jalil Zaland and the encouragement of Afghan singer Parveen, who had noticed the teen perform in family events, Zheela started her career under the mentorship of Ustad Khyal who trained the singer for five years in various musical instruments. She also received some assistance from Ustad Shayda, the man who suggested she adopt the professional name Zheela after attending her first concert. Although there were other female singers in Afghanistan before her, but it is agreed that Zheela became the first female celebrity through singing. During this time Zheela recorded mostly for the radio but her popularity increased with her television songs when the audience could finally put a face to the singer they had only known through the radio. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, she was recognized as the most popular female singer and she garnered notability from music industries outside of Afghanistan. In addition to her solo work, Zheela also had collaborations on her songs, often in the form of duets with such singers as Ahmad Zahir, Jalil Zaland, and Ustad Khyal. But her most notable collaboration came in 1964 when she sang a duet with Mohammed Rafi, India‚Äôs most prolific singer at the time. Their song became hugely popular on Kabul Radio as this was the first time that an Indian singer sang in Persian. This time coincided with a time when relations between Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar (India‚Äôs sole movie playback singers) had soured and Mohammed Rafi requested Zheela stay in India and replace Lata Mangeshkar as the lead female playback singer for Bollywood movies. It was a request that Zheela turned down as she wished to return to her family in Afghanistan. In 1973, Zheela performed in the musical play ‚Äúÿ±ŸÅ€åŸÇÿßŸÜ ÿ®€å ŸàŸÅÿß‚Äù that brought her some notability as an actress. Later life Due to the political situation, Zheela left Afghanistan in the early 1980s. She initially traveled with her family to Karachi, Pakistan, and after staying there 13 months, she immigrated to US state of California in 1982. After this time, her involvement in the Afghan music scene was limited but ongoing.

The Flotilla operated on the Danube River and also, at times, on other rivers connected to the Black Sea. 1940 flotilla The Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940 gave the Soviet Union a border on the Danube, so the first Danube Flotilla was constituted to help defend this border. It was based in Izmail and was formed of ships transferred from the Dnieper Flotilla. The new Danube Flotilla initially consisted of five monitors (armed with 102mm and 130mm guns), twenty two armored boats, five transports, and four launches, supported by an anti-aircraft battalion, fighter squadron, a naval infantry company, a machine gun company, and several shore batteries (two 152mm, one 130mm, one 75mm, and one 45mm gun batteries). Upon the start of the war the flotilla was reinforced by an additional another one shore battery (122mm A-19), in exchange for the transfer of the four launches to the Black Sea Fleet. At the beginning of the Romanian‚ÄìGerman invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, the Flotilla cooperated with Red Army troops in the defense of the southern front. On June 24‚Äì25, 1941, the Flotilla participated in a counterattack crossing of the Danube onto the Romanian side. After this, the Flotilla supported troops trapped in bridgeheads, and as the Red Army withdrew to Odessa the Flotilla ferried troops across the Southern Bug and Dnieper Rivers. The Flotilla was disbanded on November 21, 1941. 1944 flotilla As the Red Army cleared Crimea and the Dniester River of German troops, the Danube Flotilla was re-constituted on the Dniester in April 1944 to assist further offensives. The flotilla assisted the Red Army in operations including the clearing of the Dniester Estuary and the clearing of the Danube Delta, including both troop-carrying and gunfire support for landings at Prymorske and Vylkove on August 23‚Äì24, 1944, and at Kiliya on August 25. As the Red Army moved upriver, the Danube Flotilla followed and participated in the Belgrade Offensive, the Budapest Offensive, and the Vienna Offensive. Flotilla operations included assisting in landings at Raduevats and Prahovo on September 29‚Äì30, 1944 (even well into the 21st century, the wrecks of about 200 vessels sunk by the Germans to block the landings remain in the Danube at Prahovo), at Smederevo on October 16, at Vukovar on December 8‚Äì10, at Gerjen on November 30‚ÄìDecember 1, at Esztergom on March 19‚Äì23, 1945, and at Radwanska on March 28‚Äì30. On April 13, 1945, as the Battle of Vienna was ending, the Flotilla landed troops in a surprise stroke at both ends of the Imperial Bridge in Vienna. This enabled the Red Army to cut the demolition cables and seize the bridge intact. For its combat exploits, the 1st Guards Armored Boat Detachment (an element of the Danube Flotilla) was awarded the Order of Kutuzov 2nd Class. The Danube Flotilla was disbanded in 1960.

At this time, the standard armored boat in production, and forming part of the strength of the Danube Flotilla, was the BK type, which featured (depending on model) one (1125 class) or two (1124 class) tank turrets with guns as main armament. The monitors were more powerful, though slower. The Udarny, a typical monitor, had two guns (as well as four 4 45mm guns). Attached to the Flotilla were the 96th Fighter Squadron, the 46th Independent Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, the 17th Machine Gun Company, and an –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã (Naval Infantry) company. At the beginning of hostilities, six batteries of coastal artillery on the Danube were attached to the Flotilla, and a Maritime Border Guard Division of the NKVD with 30 boats was under the operational control of the Flotilla.

Written in Adobe Flash, the game was built over the course of about half a year in Ocias' spare time. Released online on 14 June 2010 onto various game hosting websites, it has garnered sizeable praise and scrutiny since its release, with critics finding the game to be thought-provoking while having poor controls. Gameplay A colourful motif appears throughout the environment if the character disobeys the narrator's instructions. A narrator first asks players, \\"are you a man, or a woman?\\" Players who select \\"man\\" are instead told they are a \\"girl\\". Similarly, players who select \\"woman\\" are called a \\"boy\\". Navigation is by arrow keys, which also control the ability to jump and duck. The narrator instructs players intermittently, sometimes to achieve goals but often to suggest actions that will kill the player character (such as falling into a pit full of spikes). Players are sometimes, but not always, congratulated when following these instructions, while disobeying the narrator results in a barrage of insults. Both the player character and environment are in stark black and white, with a colourful motif appearing if the character disobeys the narrator's instructions, or the visuals becoming more detailed but still in monochrome if the character decides to be compliant. Development Loved was built over the course of about half a year, transforming from the exploration genre to a mining- and building-based adventure game before settling on the platform genre. Ocias worked on the game intermittently in his spare time, using his \\"bit of self-taught programming knowledge\\" to code it. Although no libraries were used during development, Ocias expressed that he wished that he had during the end of production. Research was taken into achieving \\"certain little fiddly things,\\" Ocias explained, such as generating the text elements and instructing Flash to read his tile maps. According to Ocias, the main themes of Loved were of dominance and power, since to provide a fuller answer would \\"defy the point of the game\\". His intentions in making the game were to get people to think about the games they were playing‚Äîa direction he found much of the video game industry shying away from. The confrontational aspect of the game was motivated by two aspects: primarily to use \\"the resource of emotions\\" invoked by its risk and reward mechanic; and secondly to absorb the awareness of people online. Expanding upon his inspirations, Ocias cited individual games such as The Last Guardian and Deus Ex: Human Revolution, along with companies such as Thatgamecompany and Eidos Montr√©al, as showing \\"greater depth\\" to video games as well as experimentation and research. Ocias ultimately stated that while he dislikes \\"force-feeding\\" players, he would try to take a different approach both mechanically and thematically for his next game. Release and reception Loved was published as freeware onto Newgrounds and Kongregate, as well as Ocias's official website, on 14 June 2010. Since its release, the game has received sizeable praise and scrutiny from players, with some responding reminiscently over it. Duncan Geere of Wired dubbed it \\"great high-brow lunchtime gaming\\" that exploits the paradox of video games being supposedly a better medium than music and films, despite most gamers being compliant by design. Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Kieron Gillen called the atmosphere \\"genuinely oppressive\\" and the game's cogitation between free will and control \\"really quite excellent\\". A review in the Italian magazine Dude named it one of their top 16 favourite independent games. In interviewing Ocias, Justin Kranzl of Gamasutra called the experience of playing the game challenging of the \\"assumptions people may hold about the respective weight of narrative and play mechanics\\". Kris Ligman of PopMatters called the controls frustrating and \\"only just playable\\", but disregarded this as \\"all it needs in order to work\\". Chris Priestman of Kill Screen found the game provoking of \\"gut reactions\\" and noted a sexual undercurrent throughout it. Referred to by Gillen, Michael Rose of IndieGames.com called the controls \\"a little wonky\\", but concluded that it was \\"definitely worth giving a go\\". Tim W. of the same website ranked the game second place of the top 10 browser platformers of 2010. Rose later published in his book 250 Indie Games You Must Play that the game is worth playing twice to see the alternative endings based on the player's decisions. Writing for the official website of G4, Brittany Vincent called the game \\"especially curious\\" in its depiction of a dominant and submissive relationship and a \\"fantastic case\\" of the medium \\"pushing the margins of human emotion\\".

Harrison also included it on his 1989 greatest- hits compilation Best of Dark Horse. As a love song to God, the track served as the artist's most overtly religious musical statement since 1974. The lyrics offer praise to Christ, Vishnu, Jehovah and Buddha, thereby marking a return to the concept of a universal deity, regardless of religious demarcation, that Harrison had first espoused in his 1970 hit single \\"My Sweet Lord\\". Harrison recorded \\"Life Itself\\" at his Friar Park studio in England in 1980. The recording features multiple slide guitar parts, played by Harrison, and contributions from musicians such as Neil Larsen, Willie Weeks and Jim Keltner. Following Warner Bros. Records' rejection of the initial submission of Somewhere in England, forcing Harrison to rework the content of the album, Al Kooper added a Hammond organ part to the track. \\"Life Itself\\" has received praise from reviewers, several of whom recognise it as a highlight of an otherwise disappointing album. Harrison's demo of the song appeared on the EP accompanying the limited-edition illustrated book Songs by George Harrison 2, published by Genesis Publications in 1992. He also agreed to its use in the 1993 audio-book format of author Deepak Chopra's Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, where the 1981 track accompanies a passage read by Chopra. In 1998, \\"Life Itself\\" was one of the Harrison compositions adapted by composers Steve Wood and Daniel May for the soundtrack to the IMAX documentary Everest. Background and composition George Harrison wrote \\"Life Itself\\" and the other songs for his album Somewhere in England between mid 1979 and the early part of 1980.Madinger & Easter, p. 459. Harrison's songwriting at this time contrasted in tone with the light-heartedness of his two previous albums, Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976) and George Harrison (1979).Madinger & Easter, p. 457. Both of these works had continued to present a softening in the artist's spiritual vision since 1974,Lavezzoli, pp. 196‚Äì97. the year in which he had publicly espoused a hard-line Hindu religiosity in his North American concerts with Ravi ShankarTillery, pp. 114‚Äì15. and in devotional songs such as \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\".The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 44, 140.Allison, pp. 46, 48. While promoting his self-titled 1979 album, Harrison said that he was no longer interested in promoting so obvious a religious message as he had in his biggest hit, \\"My Sweet Lord\\".Huntley, p. 180. Later in 1979, the content of his HandMade Films comedy Monty Python's Life of Brian attracted controversy from Christian religious groups,Harry, p. 212.Doggett, p. 262. a point to which Harrison later responded: \\"All it made fun of was people's stupidity in the story [of Jesus Christ] ‚Ä¶ Actually it was upholding Him and knocking all the idiotic stuff that goes on around religion ‚Ä¶\\"Tillery, p. 120.Huntley, p. 159. Songs such as \\"Life Itself\\", \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" and \\"Sat Singing\\" nevertheless reflected his return to more spiritually focused songwriting,Rodriguez, pp. 386, 433.Snow, p. 69. recalling the themes of Harrison's albums All Things Must Pass (1970) and Living in the Material World (1973). Author Simon Leng draws parallels between \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"Every Grain of Sand\\",Leng, pp. 219‚Äì20. a song written by Bob Dylan later in 1980, midway through his born-again Christian period.Heylin, pp. 528‚Äì29. According to Leng, the two compositions address a similar issue in their statements of faith, but whereas Dylan sings of \\"hanging in the balance of the reality of man\\", Harrison has \\"arrived at his destination\\" and is \\"making an offering\\" to his deity. Like Leng,Leng, p. 119. theologian Dale Allison describes \\"Life Itself\\" as Harrison's \\"love song to God\\".Allison, p. 148. Allison also notes that, as a progression from Harrison's more Hindu-focused exhortations up to 1974, the song's strong \\"theological assertions\\" reflect his recognition of Christ,Allison, pp. 48, 55. a perspective that Harrison increasingly explored in subsequent decades.Tillery, p. 154. The song is a slow ballad in the key of C.Allison, p. 88. In his lyrics, Harrison's directly addresses his deity, whom he describes as variously a lover, a friend, the source of truth,Allison, pp. 148‚Äì49. and the essence of all \\"We taste, touch and feel\\". He recognises God as both \\"the breath of life itself\\" and \\"the light in death\\".Allison, pp. 18, 88, 148. Harrison also lists some of the names by which the deity is popularly referred: Christ, Vishnu, Buddha, Jehovah and \\"Our Lord\\".Allison, pp. 55, 148-49.Somewhere in England CD booklet (Dark Horse Records, 2004; produced by George Harrison & Ray Cooper), p. 5. He finds further common ground in all faiths by saying that God, as \\"the One\\", is Govindam, Bismillah and \\"Creator of All\\". Regardless of the characterisations adopted by specific religions, the song depicts love as the essential quality in Harrison's vision of a deity.Inglis, p. 75. Recording Harrison first taped a demo of \\"Life Itself\\" at his FPSHOT studio in Henley, Oxfordshire, shortly before beginning the recording of Somewhere in England in March 1980. Harrison played all the instruments on this early version,Huntley, p. 244.Inglis, p. 103. including electric guitars and ukulele. He then recorded the track during the main sessions for the album, held at FPSHOT through to September 1980.Badman, p. 263.Inglis, p. 72. Aside from Harrison, who also served as producer,Badman, p. 266. the musicians at the sessions were Neil Larsen and Gary Brooker (both on keyboards), Ray Cooper (percussion), Willie Weeks (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums). The latter's presence marked the first time he had played on a Harrison album since 1975,Inglis, pp. 150‚Äì51. since when Keltner had become a key member in Dylan's backing band,Heylin, pp. 506‚Äì07. as well as sharing Dylan's evangelical Christian beliefs.Sounes, pp. 329‚Äì31, 342. The arrangement of Harrison's electric guitar parts ‚Äì which include picked rhythm parts, slide riffs, and a separate slide part playing the solos and fills ‚Äì changed little between the demo and the formal recording.Madinger & Easter, p. 460. Leng suggests that the latter was in fact built up from Harrison's demo.Leng, p. 220. After submitting Somewhere in England to Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label, in late September 1980,Doggett, p. 267. Harrison was forced to rework the content of the albumClayson, pp. 377‚Äì78. ‚Äì including replacing four of the original songs ‚Äì to ensure the release had more commercial appeal.Rodriguez, p. 433.Snow, pp. 68, 69. Harrison chose to retain \\"Life Itself\\" and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album.Leng, p. 213. For these sessions, beginning in November, Harrison enlisted keyboardist Al Kooper to complete the recordings.Kooper, pp. 230, 232. Kooper overdubbed a Hammond organ part, adding to Brooker's original contribution.Clayson, p. 380. In Leng's description, the gospel inflections of this final addition combine with Harrison's backing vocals and \\"guitar choir\\" to \\"convey his spiritual vision in music\\". The mix of the song changed significantly between the original submission and the reworked album, for which Cooper was credited as a co-producer.Harry, p. 349. Release and reception Somewhere in England was released on 1 June 1981.Badman, p. 284.Tillery, p. 164. \\"Life Itself\\" was sequenced as the third track, between \\"Unconsciousness Rules\\" and \\"All Those Years Ago\\", which was Harrison's tribute to his former Beatles bandmate John LennonHarry, pp. 349‚Äì50. and another song to which Kooper added a key musical contribution.Leng, p. 222. The album was a relative commercial success,Inglis, p. 78.Ingham, pp. 129, 136. an outcome that was due largely to a public outpouring of grief in reaction to Lennon's murder in December 1980.Larkin, pp. 2646‚Äì47.Leng, pp. 217‚Äì18.Madinger & Easter, pp. 459‚Äì60. Although the album received mixed reviews, music critics responded favourably towards \\"Life Itself\\". Harry Thomas of Rolling Stone described the song as \\"an explicit paean to 'the One' in all His guises ‚Ä¶ With beautifully filigreed overdubs of breathy, echoing voices and poignant slide-guitar figures ‚Ä¶ the music conjures up a magical temple of mirrors.\\" While less impressed with Somewhere in England generally,Huntley, p. 183.Leng, p. 177. Thomas also wrote of \\"Life Itself\\" as \\"gorgeous and haunting\\" and a track that \\"sums up what [Harrison] does best and ‚Äì judging from the care he lavishes on it ‚Äì what he loves best\\".Harry Thomas, \\"George Harrison: Somewhere In England\\", Rolling Stone, 6 August 1981, p. 44 (archived version from 24 November 2007, retrieved 19 November 2016). People magazine's reviewer admired the album as \\"a musical giant's defiant tribute to the value of life\\" and described the song as \\"a moving, warming ballad\\".\\"Picks and Pans Review: Somewhere in England\\", People, 27 July 1981 (archived version from 27 December 2013, retrieved 19 November 2016). Conversely, writing in Creem, Mitchell Cohen cited the track as an example of the album's diminishing quality after the opening song, \\"Blood from a Clone\\", in which Harrison criticised Warner's, and he added: \\"'Life Itself' is God's resume, complete with noms d'omnipotence. ('You are the real love that I've got' George sings, as Olivia chalks up evidence for future alienation of affection charges.)\\"Mitchell Cohen, \\"George Harrison: Somewhere In England\\", Creem, September 1981; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). NME critic Bob Woffinden welcomed the song as an example of how the album's subject matter ranged beyond the \\"humdrum\\". He found it \\"only characteristic of [Harrison] to embrace more universal themes\\", adding that \\"probably only he could have composed a song entitled 'Life Itself'.\\"Woffinden, p. 107. Retrospective assessment and legacy Huntley writes that Harrison clearly \\"had a soft spot\\" for \\"Life Itself\\". He included the track on his 1989 compilation album Best of Dark Horse.Harry, p. 28. Harrison's demo of the song appeared as the opening track on the EP accompanying Songs by George Harrison 2 in 1992.Allison, p. 149.Madinger & Easter, pp. 459, 638. In an act that Leng terms \\"unprecedented\\", Harrison authorised the inclusion of \\"Life Itself\\", along with \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" and \\"That Which I Have Lost\\", on the audio book release of Deepak Chopra's bestseller Ageless Body Timeless Mind.Leng, p. 326. The song was also one of the Harrison compositions adapted in the Tibetan folk style by composers Steve Wood and Daniel May for the soundtrack to the 1998 IMAX documentary Everest.Badman, pp. 588, 589.Huntley, pp. 278‚Äì79. According to Huntley, Greg MacGillivray, the film's director, chose Harrison's music for its \\"spiritual quality\\" and \\"his ties to eastern religion\\".Huntley, p. 279. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense admired the song's guitar parts as evidence of how effectively Harrison composed his solos. Rense added: \\"The conversational duet-solos in 'Life Itself' and 'Beautiful Girl' ‚Äì where his solo guitars overlap and answer one another ‚Äì are impressively imaginative, virtuosic.\\"Rip Rense, \\"\\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", Beatlefan, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 24 November 2016). In his review of the 2004 reissue of Somewhere in England, John Metzger of The Music Box described \\"Life Itself\\" as the highlight of the album and \\"a devotional ballad of utmost beauty\\".John Metzger, \\"George Harrison The Dark Horse Years (Part Three: Somewhere in England)\\", The Music Box, vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 20 November 2016). Writing for Blender that year, Paul Du Noyer similarly recognised the song as the album's \\"standout track\\".Paul Du Noyer, \\"Back Catalogue: George Harrison\\", Blender, April 2004, pp. 152‚Äì53. James Griffiths of The Guardian paired \\"Life Itself\\" with the 1979 ballad \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" as two \\"transcendentally lovely\\" songs, and examples of how Harrison's Dark Horse releases were often unjustly overlooked.James Griffiths, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse Years Deluxe Box Set\\", The Guardian, 19 March 2004 (retrieved 24 November 2016). Simon Leng cites the same pair of songs as works that are \\"the closest to his musical 'soul'\\", whereby \\"[Harrison's] meticulous craftsmanship as a singer, guitar player, and arranger was used to create aural replicas of grace.\\"Leng, p. 320. Author Ian Inglis includes \\"Life Itself\\" among Harrison songs that possess \\"great charm, energy, and beauty\\" yet may be little known due to the lack of critical acclaim afforded their respective parent album.Inglis, p. 141. Inglis praises the song for its \\"gorgeous melody of rising and falling phrases\\" and adds: \\"It is a beautifully crafted and gently sung track ‚Ä¶ his spiritual certainty is fixed, unchanging, and permanent.\\" Personnel According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter: * George Harrison ‚Äì vocals, electric guitars, slide guitars, backing vocals * Neil Larsen ‚Äì keyboards * Gary Brooker ‚Äì organ * Al Kooper ‚Äì Hammond organ * Willie Weeks ‚Äì bass * Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums * Ray Cooper ‚Äì percussion Notes References Sources * Dale C.

That is, the team ‚Äúowners‚Äù in MLS, including AEG, the Kraft family, and others, are really operator- investors in MLS‚Äôs structure.\\") Each MLS team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league. In order to control costs, the league shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. The league has 26 investor-operators for its 26 clubs. AEG, which at one time invested in six clubs, solely owns one team (LA Galaxy). Lamar Hunt used to own multiple teams, but now Hunt Sports owns only one team (FC Dallas). Two of the league's teams are owned, at least in part, by neither Americans nor Canadians ‚Äî Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz (New York Red Bulls), and Indonesian Erick Thohir (D.C. United). History Having multiple clubs owned by a single owner was a necessity in the league's first ten years. At one time Phil Anschutz's AEG owned six MLS clubs, and Lamar Hunt's Hunt Sports owned three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club owner.Sports Illustrated, \\"Garber, Horowitz discuss MLS contraction\\", January 9, 2002. These changes included granting owners the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits of Soccer United Marketing, and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships. As MLS appeared to be on the brink of overall profitability in 2006 and developed significant expansion plans, MLS announced that it wanted each club to have a distinct owner.Sports Business Daily, \\"MLS‚Äô Don Garber Talks State Of The League With The Daily\\", April 5, 2007.

He served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1852 to 1866. He was born and educated in Harbour Grace. He studied law with George Henry Emerson and was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1841. He served as chief clerk and registrar for the northern circuit court and as sub-collector of customs at Harbour Grace. In 1849, John and his young family headed for Washington County in Wisconsin. They traveled during a week and a half. They took a boat from Newfoundland to New York, then up the canals to Albany, another boat to Buffalo. They traveled to Wisconsin by wagon and bought a farm and had land cleared. After a few months, in a letter to his father-in-law, he seems full of optimism.Commentary from editor, Weekly Herald and Conception Bay Advertiser, Jan 24, 1850. In spite of that, he was back in Harbour Grace at the end of 1850, and was sub-collector of Customs in 1851. He was elected to the assembly for Conception Bay in 1852 and for Harbour Grace in 1855 and again in 1859. He served as Solicitor General in the provincial cabinet until 1861. The results of the 1861 election in Harbour Grace were set aside due to violence at the polls; Hayward was re-elected in a by-election held later that year. He was elected again in 1865 and was named Solicitor General again. Hayward was opposed to the union with Canada proposed in 1866. He retired from politics in August of that year and was named an assistant justice in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland. Hayward retired from the bench due to illness in 1884 and died the following year.

It was conceived by the Mercedes-Benz Advanced Design Studio in Carlsbad, California, who also previously created the Mercedes-Benz Biome. This car has been featured in the popular mobile racing video games Asphalt 8: Airborne and Asphalt Nitro. The Silver Lightning drew heavy inspiration from the 1930s Silver Arrow race cars, most notably the Mercedes-Benz W125 driven by Rudolf Caracciola that won the 1937 Grand Prix, as well as the famous 1955 Mercedes- Benz 300 SLR designed by Rudolf Uhlenhaut. The design theme was also influenced by some sci-fi movies, such as Star Trek, Tron: Legacy and Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones. The car's sleek, futuristic appearance also comes with innovative features as well. Its roof is constructed of several pieces of small, lightweight magnetic squares, and uses Mag-Tech technology that allows them to either combine to form a hardtop, or retracted to convert the car into a roadster. The omni-directional wheels allow the Silver Lightning to be able to steer freely in any direction, and are enclosed in rings integrated within the car's main body. To comply with the competition's theme of designing \\"Hollywood‚Äôs Hottest New Movie Car\\", it was accompanied by a short film called Silver Lightning, which features two crash test dummies called Hans05 and Franz02 attempting and eventually succeeding in the rescue of their prized stolen Silver Lightning from Dr. Crash-Barrier, the main antagonist of the movie.

The genre evolved out of the diverse musical practices of the Appalachian region of the United States. Appalachian folk music was largely Scottish and Irish, with an important influence also being the African American country blues. Parts of Ontario, British Columbia and the Maritime provinces shared a tradition with the Appalachian region, and country music became popular quite quickly in these places. Fiddlers like George Wade and Don Messer helped to popularize the style, beginning in the late 1920s. Wade was not signed until the 1930s, when Victor Records, inspired by the success of Wilf Carter the year before, signed him, Hank Snow and Hank LaRivi√®re. Canadian country as developed by Otto Wilke, Carter, Snow and Earl Heywood, used a less nasal and more distinctly pronounced vocal style than American music, and stuck with more traditional ballads and narratives while American country began to use more songs about bars, family relationships, and quarrels between lovers. This style of country music became very popular in Canada over the next couple of decades. Later popular Canadian country stars range from Stompin' Tom Connors and Tom Jackson to Shania Twain and Rick Tippe to Dean Brody, Brett Kissel, Paul Brandt and Jess Moskaluke.Stompin' Tom Connors, 2005 Radio and television stations in Canada which play country music, however, are sometimes more flexible in how they define the genre than their counterparts in the United States. Canadian country stations have commonly played artists more commonly associated with folk music, such as Bruce Cockburn, Leahy, Spirit of the West and The Rankin Family. There is also a small francophone scene in the genre, typically sung in the joual accent. Francophone artists include Ren√©e Martel, Gildor Roy, Patrick Norman, Willie Lamothe, Steph Carse and Georges Hamel.

In 2014, he won the Grade I 2014 Breeders' Cup Classic, following wins in the Haskell Invitational and the Pennsylvania Derby. He is owned by Kaleem Shah, who purchased him as a two-year-old, based upon the advice of his teenaged son. He was named after Shah's favorite soccer team, FC Bayern Munich. The horse was trained by Bob Baffert, and was retired in 2015. Background Bayern is a bay ridgling bred in Kentucky by Helen Alexander. His sire, Offlee Wild was a successful racehorse whose wins included the Massachusetts Handicap in 2004 (beating Funny Cide) and the Suburban Handicap in 2005. Before Bayern, the best of his progeny was Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner She Be Wild. As of 2014, Offlee Wild stands at the Pin Oak Lane Farm in Pennsylvania. Bayern's dam Alittlebitearly was, as her name suggests, born prematurely on December 14, 2002, which made her almost useless for racing purposes. The age of a Thoroughbred racehorse born in the Northern Hemisphere advances by one year on January 1, meaning that Alittlebitearly officially became a yearling when less than a month old and, if raced, would have had to compete on level terms with horses who could be up to 11 months older. His owner Kaleem Shah obtained the horse as a two-year-old at a training sale when his teenaged son, Arman, was impressed with the colt. Bayern was originally named \\"Tahrir Square\\" when he was sold to Shah, but was renamed after the association football (soccer) team FC Bayern Munich, the favorite team of his owner. His name is pronounced by track announcers and the US press as \\"BY-earn.\\"() Racing career =2014: three-year-old season= Bayern was unraced as a two-year-old and made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Santa Anita Park on January 4, 2014. Ridden by Gary Stevens, he took the lead on the turn into the stretch and drew away to win by lengths from Rprettyboyfloyd . He reappeared over one mile at the same track in February and started the 3-5 favorite against four opponents. He took the lead soon after the start and steadily increased his advantage to win by 15 lengths. The colt was then moved up sharply in class to contest the Grade I Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park on April 12. He took the lead from the start before being overtaken in the straight and finishing third behind Danza and Ride On Curlin. Rosie Napravnik was his jockey when Bayern contested the Derby Trial Stakes at Churchill Downs two weeks later. He led from the start and prevailed by a nose over Embellishing Bob but was demoted to second for causing interference to the runner-up. On May 17, the colt was moved up to the highest level for the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. Starting with Napravnik up at odds of 12.9-1, he finished tenth of the eleven runners behind the Kentucky Derby winner, California Chrome. Bayern did not contest the Belmont Stakes and was instead aimed at the seven-furlong Woody Stephens Stakes at the same meeting. He contested the early lead before taking a clear advantage entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by seven and a half lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. Stevens returned as his jockey and said, \\"That was a powerhouse performance. He had a bad experience in the gate in the Preakness. Jimmy Barnes [assistant to trainer Bob Baffert] and Bob's crew did a great job getting him ready by schooling, schooling, schooling him.\\" Bayern was moved back up in class and distance for the Grade I Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park on July 27. Ridden for the first time by Martin Garcia, he was the second choice in the betting behind the filly Untapable. Garcia took the lead from the start and set a steady pace before drawing away in the straight to win by more than seven lengths from Albano, with Untapable in fifth place. Baffert, who won the race for a record seventh time, watched the running on television. After the race, the trainer, who said that he had considered keeping the horse to sprint distances, stated, \\"We tried to slow him down in the past, but now we know we just have to utilize his speed. I didn't think he'd do it as devastating as that. It looks like he has it all together now.\\" On August 27, Bayern was the favorite for the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course against a field which included Belmont Stakes winner Tonalist, Kentucky Derby runner-up Commanding Curve, and Wood Memorial Stakes winner Wicked Strong, who had defeated Tonalist in the Jim Dandy Stakes. Bayern started quickly and set a strong pace against Tonalist but weakened badly in the stretch and was eased down by Garcia in the closing stages, finishing last of the ten runners behind the upset winner, V. E. Day. On September 20, Bayern ran in the Pennsylvania Derby over nine furlongs at Parx, a race which featured the return of California Chrome, running for the first time since his defeat in the Belmont. As in the Haskell, Bayern broke quickly and set a steady pace before picking up the pace on the final turn. He increased his advantage in the straight to win in by lengths with a track record time of 1:46.96. Tapiture finished second, and California Chrome was sixth. Baffert commented, \\"That was just a powerful performance... When Bayern runs like that, nobody's going to beat him.\\" In the wake of his performance, recognizing the retirement of the successful Game On Dude just two days prior, news stories noted that Baffert's nickname for Bayern was \\"Little Dude\\", recognizing that both had a front-running style but also fared poorly when unable to control the pace from the lead. Bayern came out of the race in good shape, and Baffert stated that he would contest the Breeders' Cup Classic. On November 1, Bayern started at odds of 6.1/1 for the 31st running of the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park. His opponents included the undefeated gelding Shared Belief, California Chrome, and Tonalist in a field which appeared dominated by three-year-olds. Exiting the gate, Bayern veered sharply to the left, badly hampering Shared Belief and Moreno before taking the early lead. He was tracked throughout the race by the British-trained Toast of New York with California Chrome close behind and maintained his advantage into the straight. In a closely contested three-way finish, Bayern prevailed by a nose from Toast of New York and a neck from third-place California Chrome. Next to finish were Shared Belief, Tonalist, and Candy Boy, meaning that the first six places were filled by three-year- olds. The racecourse stewards conducted an inquiry into the interference caused by Bayern at the start but allowed the result to stand. After the race, Garcia said, \\"It's an amazing feeling, a dream come true... We let him run, and if anything happens, you make adjustments. In this race, he broke really good and I took advantage. I was pretty sure that I didn't do anything. In racing, these things happen.\\" =2015: four-year-old season= Bayern's return was delayed by a foot abscess which interrupted his training schedule in early 2015. He began his second season with a drop back in distance as he contested the Churchill Downs Stakes on the Kentucky Derby undercard on May 2. He never reached the lead and finished last of the six runners behind Private Zone. In the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont on 6 June, he finished last of the ten runners, twenty-nine lengths behind the winner Honor Code. He was dropped back to Grade II level in July and started favorite under top weight of 123 pounds in the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack. He produced a somewhat improved effort to finish third behind the Argentinian-bred Catch A Flight. In August, he contested the Pacific Classic but though he led in the initial stages of the race, he faded after being passed on the turn by Beholder and finished second to last of 10 horses. Bayern finished third in the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita to Smooth Roller prompting discussion of whether he would be retired, with an announcement of his retirement in the days that followed. Stallion career Bayern entered stud at Hill 'N' Dale Farms in Kentucky. His 2017 stud fee stands at $15,000. Assessment and awards In the Eclipse Awards for 2014, Bayern finished runner-up to California Chrome in the voting for American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and third behind California Chrome and Main Sequence in the American Horse of the Year poll. In the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, published in January 2015, Bayern was rated the best horse trained in the United States, and the ninth-best racehorse in the world.

Canadian heavy metal music is a short history. Going back to the Late 1960s, Canada has produced metal bands that have and continue to influence metal bands to this day. In 1964, Toronto-based band The Sparrows was formed. This band later changed their name to Steppenwolf and featured Canadians John Kay, Goldy McJohn and Jerry Edmonton. Steppenwolf's 1968 single \\"Born to be Wild\\" was the first use of the words 'heavy metal' in a song's lyric. In 1970, Woodstock, Ontario based Warpig released their metal music debut, which, although never reaching mainstream success like fellow heavy metal bands Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer, has become a cult favourite within the Doom metal scene. Some of Canada's most successful metal bands opted to change their style from the early 1980s roots metal sound to the growing glam metal style that became mainstream in the late 1980s. Bands like Helix, Kick Axe, Brighton Rock, Killer Dwarfs, Annihilator, and Slik Toxik saw growing popularity in the mid 1980s thanks in part to Much Music and MTV playing their videos in regular rotation. Canada's death metal scene has produced artists most of whom are based out of Quebec. Bands like Kataklysm, Cryptopsy, Quo Vadis, Gorguts, Augury, Voivod, Martyr, and Neuraxis have a strong underground following and are signed to major independent metal labels. In the 2000s, Canadian extreme metal has been put on the map by Vancouver band Strapping Young Lad (featuring Devin Townsend), 3 Inches of Blood, Ottawa grindcore quartet Fuck The Facts, Regina band Into Eternity, and progressive metal band Protest the Hero. James Labrie lead singer of Dream Theater is Canadian born. Some notable black metal bands have come from Ontario, including Woods of Ypres, Wolven Ancestry, Zogroth and Eclipse Eternal. The cult black/death metal band Blasphemy, formed in 1984 in British Columbia, are still touring despite not having released a studio album since 1993. Canada has a very strong underground metal scene in cities such as Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, and Quebec City. In the early 1980s, Vancouver gained itself the reputation of being called the \\"Metal Central of Canada\\". However, this title has more recently been associated with Toronto, mostly because of an international interest in the burgeoning traditional heavy metal scene that began erupting in the late 2000s. Anvil at the 2010 Independent Spirit Awards in Los Angeles, California. Anvil are a Canadian heavy metal band from Toronto, Ontario, formed in 1978. The band has released fifteen studio albums, and has been cited as having influenced many notable heavy metal groups, including Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax and Metallica. The band was the subject of the 2008 documentary film, Anvil! The Story of Anvil. Upon its release, the film garnered critical acclaim from many major publications, and has since brought the band renewed recognition, including opening slots with AC/DC and Saxon. Helix is a Canadian hard rock/heavy metal band. They formed in 1974, and are best known for their 1984 single \\"Rock You.\\" Helix have toured with bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith, Rush, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan, and Mot√∂rhead among others. Their most recent studio album is 2009's Vagabond Bones. Kick Axe is a Canadian heavy metal band from Regina, Saskatchewan. The band achieved moderate commercial success in the mid-1980s on the strength of the singles \\"Heavy Metal Shuffle\\", \\"On the Road to Rock\\", and \\"Rock The World\\". Following the release of their 1986 album Rock the World, Kick Axe disbanded and remained on hiatus until 2004 when they re-emerged with the album Kick Axe IV.

The last passenger service to the station was Amtrak's Chesapeake from 1978 to 1983. The brick station building still remains along the Northeast Corridor tracks. History =Pennsylvania Railroad= The 1935-built station included this southbound passenger shelter, with a pedestrian subway (grey grate under the canopy). The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad was completed from Wilmington to Baltimore in 1837 (save for the Susquehanna River ferry), with stops at most population centers including Elkton. A test train ran from Wilmington to Elkton on January 9, 1837, though service did not begin until July 31 of that year. A replacement station was built in 1855. The line became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1881. The line originally ran on a tight curve through the town center, disrupting traffic and creating a collision hazard at grade crossings, as well as acting as a major speed restriction on express trains. In 1934, the PRR moved the line north of the downtown area to ease the curve and eliminate all grade crossings in Elkton. Construction on a new station began in February 1935 and was completed several months later. The new brick depot included baggage and waiting rooms, and a pedestrian passage under the tracks to the southbound platform. By 1938 Elkton was served by 18 trains per day. Traffic declined after the construction of the Interstate Highway System; stopping service declined to three daily trains by 1963 and ended several years later. The line passed to Penn Central and eventually to Amtrak with all trains passing Elkton without stopping. =Amtrak= An Amtrak train (not the Chesapeake) passes Elkton station in 1981 On April 30, 1978, Amtrak began operation of the Chesapeake, a once-daily commuter train between Philadelphia and Washington D.C., which included reopening several closed stations. On January 1, 1983, the obligation for Conrail to provide commuter service on rail lines it had taken over in 1976 ended. SEPTA Regional Rail took over Philadelphia-area lines, while Amtrak began operating service in Maryland under contract to MARC. Now largely redundant to Amtrak intercity and MARC regional service, the Chesapeake was cut on October 30, 1983. SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line ran as far south as Newark, Delaware, while MARC service ran as far north as Perryville, Maryland. Elkton station, the only station in the gap between the two, was abandoned. =Proposed MARC service= Elkton is proposed to be revived as a station on an extension of MARC's Penn Line to Newark, Delaware.

Ophir Creek flows to Washoe Lake in Washoe County in western Nevada, shortly after passing under U.S. Route 395. History Ophir Creek is named for the 1853 discovery of the Comstock Ophir bonanza, a major silver discovery. Ophir was classically a wealthy region described in the Bible, from where King Solomon received tribute of gold, silver, and other precious items. To reduce the silver metal from the ore from the Comstock Ophir mine, the Ophir Mining Company erected the Ophir Mill in 1861 on Washoe Lake's (what was then Washoe Marsh) west shore. A historic marker just north of Ophir Creek on U.S. Route 395 marks its location (39¬∞17'48.2\\"N 119¬∞49'45.0\\"W) Closet Street Makayla Way. Upper and Lower Price Lakes were named for W. E. Price, a sawmill operator and assemblyman for Washoe County in 1873. A 1983 landslide from aptly named Slide Mountain abruptly filled Lower Price Lake. Watershed and course Ophir Creek is part of the Steamboat Creek/Washoe Lake subwatershed of the Truckee River watershed. The Ophir Creek watershed drains . Ophir Creek's watershed includes two lakes, Upper Price Lake at and Rock Lake at . Ecology In 2009 the federal Bureau of Land Management acquired a 69-acre parcel between Davis Regional County Park and Bowers Mansion County Park pursuant to the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA), which was enacted in 1998. This protects environmentally sensitive land including lower Ophir Creek and two specially designated species that require wetland or flowing water habitat, the Carson Silverspot butterfly (Speyeria nokomis carsonensis) and the mountain yellow- legged frog (Rana muscosa). It also includes the historic Ophir Flume, built in 1856 by Mormon settlers, which still carries water from Ophir Creek to ranches in the southwestern Washoe Valley. Recreation The Ophir Creek Trail can be accessed at the top by parking on the side of Nevada State Highway 431 at Tahoe Meadows, southwest of the Mount Rose Summit pass and northeast of Incline Village. Here the hiker may also access the Tahoe Rim Trail. The Ophir Creek Trail begins on boardwalks through the verdant, subalpine Tahoe Meadows then descends to Upper Price Lake. From here hikers can reclimb the descent or continue down another to the trailhead at the bottom in Davis Creek Regional Park on the western edge of the Washoe Valley.
