The union is the result of a merger of two unions: United Voice and the National Union of Workers. The union is unique in its structure, having only one centralised federal branch which is not splintered into separate state branches. History In 2018, plans began to merge the two the unions United Voice and National Union of Workers. In June 2019, the Fair Work Commission approved a vote on the proposed merger between the two unions held in August 2019.. On 30 August 2019 the Australian Electoral Commission declared the result of the vote, with just over 95% of members supporting the amalgamation. Governance and structure The organisation operates as a national structure and does not have divisions or branches. Governance of the organisation is vested in a National Convention of approximately 500 Delegates, from industries and workplaces across Australia, elected by all financial members. A meeting of the convention is held every 4 years. Between meetings of the National Convention its powers are exercised by a Member Council, consisting of 50 rank and file Councillors and the National Executive. Both the Councillors and the National Executive are elected by and from the convention. The Committee of Management of the organisation is called the National Executive. It consists between 12 and 24 members, including the National President, National Secretary and 4 National Vice-Presidents. Elections for all office positions within the organisation are conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The term of office for all offices is 4 years. Tim Kennedy, former National Secretary of the NUW, is the National Secretary, and Jo-anne Schofield, former National Secretary of United Voice, is the National President.

Storfjord was a Norwegian hunting, meteorological and radio station (\\"Storfjord/LMR\\")'Kystradio - Stasjonshistorie located in King Christian IX Land, Eastern Greenland. Administratively the area were the hut stood belongs now to the Sermersooq municipality. The station was built on the shore of Kangerlussuaq Fjord, also known as Storjord. The anchorage near the station was difficult owing to the deep waters of the fjord and the very strong currents.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 109 History In 1931 Norway sent two expeditions to establish hunting and radio stations in Southeast Greenland. Led by Ole Mortensen, one of the expeditions went to Kangerlussuaq Fjord on ship Signalhorn and built a hut there, Storfjord Station. Since hunting there was poor, Mortensen moved with his men south to Lindenow Fjord, where a Norwegian radio and meteorological station named Moreton was built from the mouth of the fjord in 1932. Meanwhile another Norwegian station was built in Thorland and named Finnsbu.Norwegian Expedition to South-East Greenland, 1932 In the same year Norway staked sovereignty claims in Southeast Greenland between 60°30'N —just north of Nanuuseq, and 63°40'N —just south of Odinland.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, pp. 188-189 As a result, another expedition was sent by the Norwegian government led by Gunnar Horn on ship Veslemari and the Storfjord Station was reestablished. Together with Finnsbu and Torgilsbu further south, as well as Jonsbu in the far north, Storfjord became part of the Norwegian contribution to the International Polar Year 1932–33.William James Mills, Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, p. 321 Danish explorer Ejnar Mikkelsen, whose 1932 Søkongen Expedition station was in the more protected Uttental Sound branch of the fjord, wondered about the choice of the site for a meteorological station by the Norwegians. According to him the Norwegian building was in a dangerous location, totally exposed to violent winds blowing from the head of Kangerlussuaq Fjord.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, p. 223 After the 1933 resolution of the Permanent Court of International Justice rejecting Norway's claims in Greenland, the stations at Storfjord and Finnsbu were closed, but Torgilsbu continued operation for a few years under Danish jurisdiction and restrictions.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, p. 192 In 1935, during the British East Greenland Expedition, geologist Lawrence Wager visited the area of Kangerlussuaq Fjord and noted that the Storfjord hut was completely destroyed, even though it had a concrete foundation and thick turf walls.

Mentioning states that would likely be impacted by the storm, he incorrectly included Alabama, which by then was known not to be under threat from the storm. After many residents of Alabama called the local weather bureau to ask about it, the bureau issued a reassurance that Alabama was not expected to be hit by the storm. Over the following week, Trump repeatedly insisted his comment had been correct. On September 4, he showed reporters a weather map which had been altered with a Sharpie marker to show the hurricane's track threatening Alabama. He also reportedly ordered his aides to obtain an official retraction of the weather bureau's comment that the storm was not headed for Alabama. On September 6, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published an unsigned statement in support of Trump's initial claim, saying that NHC models \\"demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\\" Multiple agencies have investigated the possibility that political influence may have been exerted over NOAA and in June and July 2020 two reports had been completed. A report released on June 15, found that both Neil Jacobs, the acting NOAA administrator, and Julie Kay Roberts, the former NOAA deputy chief of staff and communications director, twice violated codes of the agency’s scientific integrity policy amid their involvement in the NOAA statement. On July 9, the inspector general of the Commerce Department issued a report confirming that Commerce officials had responded to orders from the White House which resulted in the statement issued by NOAA. A third investigation being done by a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has not yet been released. Original comment President Trump receives an update on Hurricane Dorian on August 29, 2019. This map was later altered to show Dorian impacting Alabama In a tweet about the approaching hurricane on September 1, 2019, Trump said that \\"South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\\" By that date, no weather forecaster was predicting that Dorian would impact Alabama, and eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the Atlantic coast. Trump, who had (on August 29) canceled his trip to Poland to monitor the hurricane, was apparently relying on information that was several days old. About 20 minutes after Trump's tweet, the Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tweet that appeared to contradict Trump, saying that Alabama \\"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian\\". On September 9, NWS director Louis Uccellini said that the Birmingham NWS had not been responding to Trump's tweet, but rather to a flood of phone calls and social media contacts their office had received, asking if the hurricane was going to hit Alabama. \\"Only later, when the retweets and politically based comments started coming to their office, did they learn the sources of this information,\\" he said. He added that the Birmingham office \\"did what any office would do to protect the public\\", counteracting the wrong information to \\"stop public panic\\" and \\"ensure public safety\\". Later on September 1, Trump told reporters that the storm was indeed threatening Alabama. Over the following days, as the hurricane moved up the coast and Alabama felt no effects from it, Trump insisted repeatedly that he had been right about the hurricane threatening the state. On September 2 he criticized a reporter who had fact-checked his comment, saying he had been right and the fact-check was \\"phony\\". Altered map President Trump displays the altered map in a video published by the White House on September 4, 2019 sharpie. On September 4 in the Oval Office, Trump displayed the National Hurricane Center's August 29 diagram of Dorian's projected track. The diagram had a line apparently made with a black marker which extended the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama. Trump said he did not know how the map came to be modified. The map incident resulted in the hashtag \\"Sharpiegate\\" trending on Twitter, with people posting invented versions of other photos modified by a marker. He stated he had \\"a better map\\" with models that \\"in all cases [showed] Alabama was hit.\\" Later the same day, Trump tweeted a map by the South Florida Water Management District dated August 29, four days before his September 1 tweet, showing numerous projected paths of Dorian. Trump incorrectly asserted \\"almost all models\\" showed Dorian hitting Alabama, even though the map showed most predicted paths would not enter Alabama. A note on the map stated it was \\"superseded\\" by National Hurricane Center publications and that it was to be discarded if there were any discrepancies. Trump also said his briefings had included a \\"95% chance\\" that the storm would strike Alabama and that \\"Alabama was hit very hard — was going to be hit very hard.\\" The Washington Post reported that NOAA had twice ordered National Weather Service employees not to provide \\"any opinion\\" on Hurricane Dorian and to \\"only stick with official National Hurricane Center forecasts\\". The first order came after Trump's September 1 comments and the Birmingham, Alabama National Weather Service's contradiction of Trump. The second order came on September 4, after Trump displayed the altered map. Following a Freedom of Information Act request by BuzzFeed News, the White House released more than 1,000 internal NOAA emails on January 31, 2020. In an internal NOAA email, staffer Corey Pieper confirmed to NWS Director of Public Affairs Susan Buchanan on September 4 that the map \\"was doctored\\", after the latter received an inquiry from NBC. Dr. Neil Jacobs, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction, wrote in an email to another NOAA scientist, \\"you have no idea how hard I'm fighting to keep politics out of science.\\" Responding to an inquiry from ABC News about the controversy, one internal NOAA email simply wrote \\"HELP!!!\\" NOAA acting chief scientist Craig McLean reacted to the unsigned NOAA statement in an email to other NOAA officials; McLean added, \\"what concerns me most is that this administration is eroding the public trust in NOAA for an apparent political recovery from an ill timed and imprecise moment from the president.\\" NOAA statement On September 6, NOAA published an unsigned statement in support of Trump's initial claim, saying that NHC models \\"demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\\" The statement also said the tweet from the Birmingham NWS office was incorrect because it \\"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\\" The September 6 statement contradicted NOAA's September 1 statement that the \\"current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\\" The September 6 statement led to pushback from meteorologists, including from the president of the NWS Employees Organization, who commented that the statement was \\"political\\", \\"utterly disgusting and disingenuous\\", and with \\"no scientific basis\\". The Commerce Department's Inspector General Peggy E. Gustafson said she was investigating the September 7 memorandum and directed NOAA employees to preserve all communications related to it. In a message to NOAA staff members, she wrote that the NWS \\"must maintain standards of scientific integrity,\\" adding that the statement called into question \\"the NWS’s processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency.\\" On September 9 The New York Times reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had called the acting administrator of NOAA, Neil Jacobs, and ordered him to undo the department's apparent contradiction of Trump. Jacobs objected, but was told that the top officials of NOAA would be fired if the disagreement was not resolved. The Commerce Department later issued a partial denial, saying \\"Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\\" Craig N. McLean, NOAA's acting chief scientist, said he would investigate how the resulting September 6 statement was issued. \\"The content of this press release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\\" he said. \\"I am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\\" On September 11, it was reported that Ross had been told by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to arrange for NOAA to support Trump's version of events and disavow the Birmingham message. According to The Washington Post, Trump himself told his staff they needed to get the contradiction fixed. The Post's sources say that Ross conveyed the message but did not threaten any firings. Trump denied the report saying, \\"It’s a hoax by the media. That’s just fake news\\". Members of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which has jurisdiction over NOAA, have launched an investigation into the Commerce Department's interactions with NOAA regarding Dorian. They are specifically interested in the two directives from NOAA to the National Weather Service and the issuance of the September 6 statement. Investigations On June 15, 2020, the first of three investigations that looked into the September 6, 2019 NOAA statement that backed Trump's false statement about the path of Hurricane Dorian was released. The report found that both Neil Jacobs, the acting NOAA administrator, and Julie Kay Roberts, the former NOAA deputy chief of staff and communications director, twice violated codes of the agency’s scientific integrity policy amid their involvement in the NOAA statement. Craig McLean, NOAA’s acting chief scientist, who had immediately called for a scientific misconduct investigation after the Sept. 6 statement, commented on the results of the investigation: \\"If not the single highest person in NOAA, who will stand for the Scientific Integrity of the agency and the trust our public needs to invest in our scientific process and products?\\" Both Jacobs and Roberts denied wrongdoing. On July 9, 2020 the inspector general of the Commerce Department, Peggy Gustafson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, issued a report confirming that Commerce officials had responded to orders from the White House which resulted in the statement issued by NOAA on September 6, 2019. The second of three investigations, the inspector general’s examination of the NOAA decision to back Trump’s Alabama assertions was the only one that was granted interviews with senior Commerce Department officials and secured access to White House communications. The report concluded: “The Statement undercut the NWS’s forecasts and potentially undercut public trust in NOAA’s and the NWS’s science and the apolitical nature of that science.\\" Gustafson also commented that the scandal could have broader repercussions in 2020 because hurricane-prone states, such as Texas and Florida, are also being heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The House Science Committee is also expected to release a report. Commentary Democratic political commentator Robert Reich called Trump's behavior irrational. \\"I think we have to face the truth that no one seems to want to admit. This is no longer a case of excessive narcissism or grandiosity. We’re not simply dealing with an unusually large ego [...] The president of the United States is seriously, frighteningly, dangerously unstable. And he’s getting worse by the day.\\" Timothy L. O'Brien called Trump \\"unstable\\" and said \\"the world is in danger\\". \\"NOAA, an agency built on science and data engineered to provide reliable, impartial information and serve the public interest, wound up purging science and data from its public profile to cover for Trump. This is how good government decays when it's compromised by a cult of personality.\\" Clifford Mass, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, published a blog on the incident, noting that Neil Jacobs was being inappropriately attacked for simply trying to defend his agency.

He was known for his research on behaviourism versus cognitivism, semantics (he introduced the term \\"semantic differential), cross-culturalism, psycholinguistic theory, and peace studies. He is credited with helping in the early development of psycholinguistics. Charles Osgood was recognized distinguished and highly honored psychologist throughout his career.  Early life and education  Charles Egerton Osgood was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, on 20 November 1916. His father was a manager at the Jordan Marsh department store in Boston. Osgood described having an unhappy childhood as his parents were divorced by the time he was six. When he was ten, his aunt, Grace Osgood, gave him a copy of Roget's Thesaurus. This gift was described by Osgood an “object of aesthetic pleasure”, sparking his fascination with words and their meanings. Osgood attended Brookline High School, where he began writing for the school newspaper, and eventually founded a school magazine. Osgood attended Dartmouth College where he intended to graduate and work as a writer for newspapers. During his second year, he enrolled in a class taught by Theodore Karwoski, thus inspiring him to switch his major in order to pursue a degree in psychology. Charles Osgood earned his B.A. in 1939 from Dartmouth, and in the same year, married Cynthia Luella Thornton. Osgood then went on to study at Yale University where he completed his Ph.D. in 1945. During his time at Yale, he worked as an assistant for Robert Sears, and collaborated with the likes of Arnold Gesell, Walter Miles, Charles Morris, and Irvin Child. However, the person with the greatest influence on his career and future work was Clark Hull. Though Osgood was heavily influenced through working alongside Hull; he stated the experience was one of the determining reasons for him pursuing a career as a researcher, rather than a clinician. Career Osgood was a social psychologist interested in psycholinguistics, and research. He was an instructor at Yale from 1942 to 1946, where he earned his doctorate degree. He worked for the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development 1946 to 1947, serving as a research associate that worked on training of B-29 gunners. During this period, Osgood also worked as an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut from 1946 to 1949. Osgood then went on to become an associate professor at the University of Connecticut from 1949 to 1952, and eventually as professor of psychology and communications from 1952 onward. He completed a majority of his work during his time at the University of Illinois, Urbana, which, along with the Institute of Communications, funded many of his works. Osgood would often submit himself to his own experiments get a better grasp of what his subjects may experience. At Illinois, Osgood was active in aiding in the hiring processes, and even arranged interviews for women at the university during times when women were facing sexism in the field of psychology. From 1957 to 1965, Osgood served as the Director of the Institute of Communications Research, and starting in 1965, he became the Director of the Center for Advanced Study. He was also elected as the director of the Centre of Comparative Psycholinguistics at the university from 1963 to 1982. In addition to this,Osgood completed a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University from 1958 to 1959; and was given an honorary doctorate from the Dartmouth College in 1962. Osgood also acted as a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii from 1964 to 1965. Death and unfinished research Charles Osgood's career ended somewhat abruptly and prematurely after developing an acute case of Korsakoff's syndrome. He was left with severe anterograde amnesia, but recovered well enough to continue working, though in a much lighter capacity as he was restricted to working from home. Toward the end of his career, Osgood decided to devote his time to three main projects. With the help of other scholars, Osgood intended on completing the interpretation of data obtained from the cross-cultural project; along with publishing 2 books, one of them, a summary of his theory of psycholinguistics (to be titled Toward an Abstract Performance Grammar), and the other on international affairs. Osgood was never able to complete any of these due to the effects of his illness, which, after a few years, forced him into complete retirement, until his death on September 15, 1991.  Works and contributions  Osgood worked on many studies mainly on cross-cultural studies in different aspects. He devoted most of his time to studies regarding Social Psychology, Cognitive-Behaviour Psychology and also on Psycholinguistics. He was renowned for four of his major works and these works have pathed the way for future researchers by facilitating them for validating their works with researches tools proposed by Osgood, also promoting international research studies on cross-cultural topics. =Mediation theory= Osgood's Mediation theory--The psycholinguistics foundations in human behaviour and communication process. Osgood proposed the mediation theory which suggested that the physical stimuli exist in our environment have elicited our internal response and lead to our interpretation of the underlined meaning of those presented stimulus. With our 3-level of thought process, we will have our internal stimuli, which are our thoughts and emotion towards the physical stimulus and the internal stimulus will bring up the outward response(s), which are visible feedbacks to the physical stimulus in the environment. Osgood also suggested that by measuring the visible outward response we can determine the intensity of emotion that has been brought up by the physical stimulus. Osgood also proposed a two-stage Meditation learning theory in the language acquisition process in 1954. The theory suggested that the use of language is an expression of mental process which is related to the cultural context of an individual. It suggested that the language acquisition process involves coding and decoding of the psychological structure within the language. His research in language, cognition, and neurophysiology had provided insight into future studies about multilingual language acquisition with a cross-cultural framework. =Semantic technique--the cross-cultural research tool = Osgood introduced a semantic technique for researchers to measure the connotative meaning of objects and concepts from the human Ecology aspect. The Semantic differential technique focused on three affective dimensions of Evaluation, Potency, and Activity (E-P-A) to evaluate social and cultural related concepts in a valid and reliable way. The practice of the semantic differential technique is being used broadly in social and behavioural science studies. = Development of the atlas of affectivemeanings (1960s–1980s)= To further improve the validity of the semantic differential technique, Osgood took the lead to develop the Atlas of Affective Meanings project from the 1960s to the 1980s. The project is indices of the affective meanings with 20 basic and derived measures of over 600 functionally equivalent concepts by analyzing over 30 language/culture communities from Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Iran, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, German, Netherlands, Finland, etc. With the development of the Atlas, affective meanings are used as universal functional markers with the E-P-A dimension and they have high validity in measuring indigenous and cross- cultural comparisons. These affective meanings are being widely applied on social-cultural studies on social dynamics, international communication, mental illness stigma and connotation of racial concepts, etc. It has a great contribution to the development of cross-cultural researches and also international communications. =Graduated reciprocation in tension reduction (GRIT) strategies = With the rise of the nuclear arms race that was brought up by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Osgood proposed the GRIT strategies (Graduated Reciprocation in Tension reduction) in 1962, which means to provide a psychological approach to resolve the tension brought up from the nuclear arm race between the two superpowers. The GRIT strategies are based on the concept of reciprocity and used to rebuild a negotiation platform for two parties who are deadlocked. The introduction of GRIT strategies not only reduced the tension between the two superpowers but also has contributed to solving various social, cultural and political conflicts worldwide. Honors and awards Charles Osgood earned many distinctions and honors within the field of psychology throughout his distinguished career. In 1960, the American Psychological Association presented Osgood with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions; three years later, Osgood was elected as president of the American Psychological Association. In addition to this, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues presented Charles E. Osgood with the Kurt Lewin Memorial Award in 1971. In the following year, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and as president of the Peace Science Society in 1976. Osgood was also the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship twice, in 1955 and again in 1972 in the field of philosophy.

Diagram depicting the regulation of inorganic phosphate within the cellular system. The Phosphate (Pho) regulon is a bacterial regulatory mechanism used for the conservation and management of inorganic phosphate within the cell. It was first discovered in Escherichia coli as an operating system for the bacterial strain, and was later identified in other species. The Pho system is composed of various components including extracellular enzymes and transporters that are capable of phosphate assimilation in addition to extracting inorganic phosphate from organic sources. This is an essential process since phosphate plays an important role in cellular membranes, genetic expression, and metabolism within the cell. Under low nutrient availability, the Pho regulon helps the cell survive and thrive despite a depletion of phosphate within the environment. When this occurs, phosphate starvation-inducible (psi) genes activate other proteins that aid in the transport of inorganic phosphate.  Function  The Pho regulon is composed of two main components including a histidine kinase sensor protein (PhoR) within the inner membrane and a transcriptional response regulator (PhoB/PhoR) on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. These proteins bind to upstream promoters in the pho regulon in order to induce a general change in gene transcription. This occurs when the cell senses low concentrations of phosphate within its internal environment causing the response regulator to be phosphorylated inducing an overall decrease in gene transcription. This mechanism is ubiquitous within gram-positive, gram-negative, cyanobacteria, yeasts, and archaea. = Signal Transduction Pathway = Depletion of inorganic phosphate within the cell is required for activation of the Pho regulon in most prokaryotes. In the most commonly studied bacterium, E. coli, seven total proteins are used to detect intracellular levels of inorganic phosphate along with transfusing that signal appropriately. Of the seven proteins, one is a metal binding protein (PhoU) and four are Phosphate- specific transporters (Pst S, Pst C, Pst A, and Pst B). The transcriptional response regulator PhoR activates PhoB when it senses low intracellular inorganic phosphate levels. = Alternative Phosphate Usage = Although inorganic phosphate is primarily used in the Pho Regulon system, there are several species of bacteria that can utilize varying forms of phosphate. One example is seen in E. coli which can use both inorganic and organic phosphate, as well as naturally occurring or synthetic phosphates (Phn). Several enzymes breakdown the compounds of the alternative phosphates, allowing the organism to use the phosphate via the C-P lyase pathway. Other species of bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium use a different pathway called the phosphonatase pathway, whereas the bacterium Enterobacter aerogenes can use either one of the pathways to cleave the C-P bond found in the alternative phosphates.  Conservation among bacterial species  Although the Pho regulon system is most widely studied in Escherichia coli it is found in other bacterial species such as Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, the transcriptional response regulator (PhoB/PhoR) retain the same function they play in E. coli. Bacillus subtilis also shares some similarities when encountering low intracellular phosphate concentrations. Under phosphate-starved conditions B. subtilis binds its transcription regulator, PhoP and the histidine kinase, PhoR to the Pho- regulon gene which induces a production of teichuronic acid. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested the critical role that techoic acid plays in the cell wall of B. subtilis, by acting as a phosphate reservoir and storing the necessary amount of inorganic phosphate in phosphate-starved conditions.  The Pho Regulon's effect on pathogenesis  Because bacteria use the Pho regulon to maintain homeostasis of Pi, it has the added effect of being used to control other genes. Many of the other genes activated or repressed by the Pho regulon cause virulence in bacterial pathogens. Three ways that this regulon effects virulence and pathogenicity are toxin production, biofilm formation, and acid tolerance. = Toxin Production = Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known opportunistic pathogen. One of its virulence factors is its ability to produce pyocyanin, a toxin released to kill both microbes and mammalian cells alike. The pyocyanin production occurs when activated by PhoB. This implies that P. aeruginosa uses the low Pi as a signal that the host has been damaged and to start producing toxin to improve chances of its survival. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, Vibrio cholera has its toxin genes repressed by PhoB. It is thought that PhoB in V. cholera is activated when Pi is low to prevent the production of toxins. It could be activated by other signals in the environment, but it has been shown that PhoB directly inhibits the toxins production by binding to the tcpPH promoter and stopping the ToxR regulon from being activated. Evidence supporting Pi as the signal is given by how the regulon is not repressed under high Pi conditions. The regulatory cascade is only repressed under low Pi conditions. = Biofilm formation = Biofilms are a mixture of microorganisms, layered together and usually adhered to a surface. The advantages of a biofilm include resistance to environmental stresses, antibiotics, and the ability to more easily obtain nutrients. PhoB is used to enhance biofilm formation in environments where Pi is not in sufficient supply. This has been shown in multiple microbes including Pseudomonas, V. cholera, and E. coli. This is not always the effect of the Pho regulon as for other species in different environments it is more advantageous to not be in biofilm when Pi is low. In these cases PhoB represses biofilm formation. = Acid Tolerance = E. coli has a protein to protect other periplasmic proteins from low pH environments called the Asr protein. The gene responsible for this protein is PhoB-dependent, and can only be turned on when the Pho regulon is activated by low Pi concentration. Synthesis of the Asr protein imparts acid shock resistance to E. coli enabling it to survive in environments like the stomach which has a low pH. Many acid tolerance genes are induced by more than just the low pH environment and require other environmental signals to be present in order to be activated. These specific nutrients being present or in low concentrations, anaerobiosis, and host- produced factors.

While Citco pointed to the fact that it had sought statements from Lancer's board of directors as to the propriety of the valuations, Judge Shira Scheindlin wrote: \\"Although these actions demonstrate Citco Group's questioning of the numbers, they could also be interpreted as Citco Group's efforts to shield its own involvement in the process\\".

The insurgency has been marked by assassinations and bombings, as well as armed confrontations with small arms and raids. Timeline =2015= =2016= On 31 March 2016, the Army of Conquest coalition claimed to have captured members of a cell belonging to Jaysh al-Thuwar, an Arab component of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Idlib that was reportedly conducting assassinations and kidnappings in the area. On 22 June 2016, the Army of Conquest's police division published a statement saying that the group's police arrested members of a cell that were helping to smuggle members of ISIL from Turkey into Idlib. On 3 August 2016, the Army of Conquest released a statement saying their security forces dismantled an ISIL cell in Idlib after 20 days of surveillance. On 4 October 2016, Ahrar al-Sham arrested an alleged ISIL cell affiliated with Jund al-Aqsa; Jund al-Aqsa later retaliated by arresting some Ahrar al-Sham members, allegedly beating the wife and shooting the brother of one member in the process. Two days later, on 6 October, Ahrar al-Sham gave an ultimatum to Jund al-Aqsa to release the captured members; Jund al-Aqsa countered by asking that Ahrar al-Sham release the captive Jund al-Aqsa members that were alleged to be a part of ISIL. =2017= On 16 June 2017, a suicide bomber attempted to assassinate Saudi cleric Abdullah al-Muhaysini, whom at the time was serving on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)'s Sharia component, after leaving a mosque in Idlib. In an online video after the attack, Muhaysini said he was uninjured and explained that an individual had approached his car wearing an explosive belt and blew themselves up. On 24 July 2017, during fighting between Ahrar al-Sham and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, car bombs were detonated in Idlib reportedly killing 50 HTS members; the car bombs reportedly belonged to Ahrar al-Sham. =2018= In February 2018, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham accused the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement of planting IEDs and assassinating HTS members in Idlib, later leading to an armed conflict between the two.

He is sometimes referred to as Albert Baur the Elder, to distinguish him from his son, , who was also an artist.  Biography  He was born to a family of bankers and was originally sent to Bonn to study medicine. In 1854, against his parents' wishes, he quit medical school and enrolled at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he studied from 1855 to 1857. His primary instructors there were Christian Köhler and Heinrich Mücke. He also took private lessons from Wilhelm Sohn and . In 1860, he moved to Munich and spent two years as a student of Moritz von Schwind. In 1863, he married Marie Beuth (1841-1917) and they had four children.Familienbuch Euregio: Albert Baur In 1864, he received a prize for his matte paintings of the Last Judgment at the in Elberfeld. This work was commissioned by the jurist, , the father of Baur's friend and school colleague, Heinrich Ludwig Philippi, whose influence prompted him to specialize in history painting. One of his first major works depicted the body of Otto III being carried across the Alps to Germany. In 1872, he was named a Professor at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar, but his attendance was apparently rather sporadic as he took numerous study trips throughout Europe. He returned to Düsseldorf in 1876 and lived there for the rest of his life. Among the best known works from this later period are a series of \\"Nischenbilder\\" (niche paintings) for the (Town Hall), depicting the Love of Art, Industriousness, Desire for Knowledge (Wissensdrang) and Patriotism.

Tanzanian troops advanced over the Ugandan border and assaulted the Ugandans' positions, forcing them to retreat. Colonel Idi Amin had seized power in a military coup in Uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship. Seven years later he attempted to invade Tanzania to the south. Ugandan troops occupied the Kagera Salient and subsequently murdered local civilians and destroyed property. The attack was eventually repulsed, and Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, unsatisfied with Amin's refusal to renounce his claims to Tanzanian territory and the international community's failure to strongly condemn the invasion, ordered his forces to advance into southern Uganda with the aim of capturing the towns of Masaka and Mbarara. Between Masaka and the Tanzanian border was the Lukoma air strip, a military installation which was overlooked by several hills: Nsambya Hill, Kikanda Hill, and the Simba Hills. Each hill was occupied by Ugandan troops. Three Tanzanian brigades were allocated for the advance to Masaka. In mid-February the Tanzanian 207th Brigade penetrated deep swampland to attack Ugandan forces at Katera, driving them away with artillery fire and thus securing the advance of the 201st and 208th Brigades to the Simba Hills. They attacked on 11 February, causing most Ugandan troops to flee. Ugandan aircraft vainly attempted to stop the Tanzanian advance, suffering heavy losses. Lukoma air strip and the surrounding hills fell on 13 February. The Tanzanians were able to successfully attack and seize Masaka eleven days later.  Background  In 1971 Colonel Idi Amin launched a military coup that overthrew the President of Uganda, Milton Obote, precipitating a deterioration of relations with the neighbouring state of Tanzania. Amin installed himself as President and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship. In October 1978 he launched an invasion of Tanzania. On 1 November he announced the annexation of the Kagera Salient, a 1,800 square kilometre (700 square mile) strip of land between the Ugandan border and the Kagera River. The Uganda Army subsequently pillaged the area it occupied, murdering civilians, stealing cattle, and destroying property, triggering the flight of 40,000 inhabitants southward. Tanzania eventually halted the assault, mobilised anti-Amin opposition groups, and launched a counter-offensive, expelling the Ugandans from its territory. On 22 January 1979 the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) seized the Ugandan border town of Mutukula to counter any further threats to Kagera. The Tanzanians then constructed an air strip in the locale so transport aircraft could resupply the troops at the front lines. Though many international actors were sympathetic with the Tanzanian position, numerous African states and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) strongly encouraged Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere to exercise restraint and not act beyond defending his territory. He had originally not intended to expand the war, but with Amin refusing to renounce his claims to Tanzanian territory and the OAU's criticism of the Kagera invasion being muted, he decided that Tanzanian forces should occupy southern Uganda—specifically the two major towns of Masaka and Mbarara.  Prelude  Map of southeastern Uganda showing Masaka and Mbarara The Tanzanians began careful planning for an offensive on the two towns. Major General David Musuguri was appointed commander of the TPDF's 20th Division and tasked with overseeing the advance into Uganda. Along the approach to Masaka was the Lukoma air strip, a military installation which was overlooked by several hills: Nsambya Hill, Kikanda Hill, and the Simba Hills. These were near the town of Kakuuto. Each hill was occupied by Ugandan troops, which were equipped with tanks and artillery. According to American intelligence analyst Kenneth M. Pollack, these were key defensive positions for Uganda. Tanzanian patrols detected the Ugandan presence in the hills. Despite holding the high ground, Ugandan commanders apparently did not know how to use their positions to their advantage; only a single trench was present on Nsambya Hill. The Ugandans placed their artillery behind Kikanda Hill. The TPDF plan allocated three brigades to the advance to Masaka: the 201st, the 207th, and the 208th. Originally, it called for the 207th Brigade to attack the Simba Hills from the east while the other two units would assault them from the south-west. More comprehensive intelligence reports informed the Tanzanians that 500 Ugandan soldiers, equipped with armoured personnel carriers and tanks, were garrisoning Katera, which was located along a peninsula in Sango Bay. Placed on a hill, Katera overlooked the road to Kasensero, and the trading center of Kyebe. Since proceeding with the original offensive would allow these troops to flank the TPDF, Musuguri ordered the 207th Brigade to secure Katera before the rest of the attack proceeded.  Battle  = Attack on Katera = The TPDF began its advance in mid February. The 207th Brigade moved out from Minziro, Tanzania. There were two routes from Minziro to Katera: the first was a road that went directly to the locale, the second was a narrow trail that meandered through swampland. Fearing that the first way was predictable and would expose his troops to Ugandan tank fire, Brigadier John Butler Walden ordered his unit to travel down the footpath. A handful of soldiers who had grown up in the lakeside villages near Bukoba and thus cognizant of local language and culture were recruited as advance scouts. Equipped with normal clothing and rare goods to win favour with the locals, they moved out to gather information on the path's condition. The scouting party returned the next day, its members exhausted and ill. They reported that the trail had been flooded by heavy rains and was rendered impassable. Walden nevertheless decided that the trail was still the best option for the advance, and ordered the 207th Brigade to proceed. Many heavy weapons—too cumbersome for transport down the path—were left behind by the Tanzanians in Minziro. Walden set out with his troops on the eight kilometre trek from Minziro to his first objective, Bulembe Hill, which was in Tanzania. The trek lasted 10 and a half hours, longer than was expected, and involved the brigade dealing with mosquitoes and tsetse flies and wading through shoulder-deep water. The unit briefly rested atop Bulembe Hill before departing north for Katera, which was 28 kilometres away. The 207th Brigade traveled through Sango Bay swamps for 50 hours in deep water. Despite supplies being carried on the soldiers' heads, the wet conditions ruined their ammunition and rations and temporarily disabled radios. The local TPDF headquarters lost contact with the unit, and feared that it had been ambushed and destroyed. The 207th Brigade exited the swamp on the third day near Katera and was able to re-establish radio contact with its headquarters. Though no Tanzanian soldiers had died during the trek, 200 fell ill and were evacuated via helicopter. Since the men of the 207th Brigade were exhausted, Tanzanian commanders postponed their attack on Katera until dawn. Instead, they bombarded the peninsula with BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers over the night. The following morning the 207th Brigade advanced into the area, finding that the Ugandan forces had retreated. Some withdrew to the Simba Hills. Intercepts of Ugandan radio communications indicated that 43 soldiers were killed in the bombardment. = Attack on Nsambya Hill, Kikanda Hill, and Simba Hills = Once the Tanzanians had secured Katera, the TPDF's 201st and 208th Brigades began advancing towards the Simba Hills. The capture of Katera made the Uganda Army aware of a Tanzanian offensive, but it could not determine the precise direction or timing of the next assault. The night before the attack on the Simba Hills, several Tanzanian brigadiers assembled for a final meeting and began drinking alcohol. After becoming intoxicated, they decided they should trick Ugandan forces into thinking they were facing foreign troops. Once reunited with their units, the brigadiers broadcast over the radio—which they knew was monitored by the Ugandans—that \\"the Cubans\\", \\"the Israelis\\" and \\"the Americans\\" were in position to attack. Immediately thereafter Ugandan troops began withdrawing en masse from the area. On 11 February the TPDF assaulted the hills, reinforced by the 207th Brigade coming from the east. Amin announced over Radio Uganda that Cuban, Israeli, and American troops were being used against him. At the hills, the Ugandan troops were routed and devastated by artillery strikes; only those that felt trapped—particularly the 1st Infantry Battalion—offered substantial resistance. In contrast to the relatively light resistance offered by Ugandan ground forces, the Uganda Army Air Force repeatedly launched bombing raids against the Tanzanians at Simba Hills, at one point forcing some Tanzanian troops to scatter. The TPDF's SA-7 man-portable air-defense system teams responded, and later claimed to have shot down 19 Ugandan aircraft. The Tanzanian Air Wing also bombed Ugandan positions during the battle. In an effort to expedite their progress while under the threat of air attack, Tanzanian troops deployed missile launchers and fired them on Ugandan positions, overwhelming the defenders. Detachments from the 201st and 208th Brigades assumed positions north of the hills, cutting off the Ugandans' retreat. The TPDF finally secured the hills and the Lukoma air strip on 13 February. According to American journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey, between 100 and 200 Ugandan soldiers were killed in battle. According to Tanzanian journalist Baldwin Mzirai, 34 Ugandan soldiers were killed at the hills. Two Tanzanians also died in the fighting. The Tanzanians seized six medium tanks and captured or destroyed several armoured personnel carriers and artillery pieces during the fighting.  Aftermath  Amin's claim that Cuban, Israeli, and American troops were being used against him was dismissed by the international community. Musuguri was nevertheless displeased by his brigadiers' ruse that had tricked the Ugandans, and issued them a formal reprimand. For its long trek through the swamp during the battle, the TPDF's 207th Brigade was dubbed \\"the Amphibious Brigade\\" by Tanzanian soldiers. A detachment of the 207th Brigade, at least 100–200 soldiers strong, garrisoned Katera for the rest of the war. Two Ugandan MiG-21s attacked the Lukoma air strip on 14 February in an attempt to destroy Tanzanian transport aircraft. The raid was easily repelled by the TPDF, as Tanzanian MiGs and ground forces responded and forced the jets to flee. On 24 February the 201st, 207th, and 208th Brigades attacked and seized Masaka. Nyerere originally planned to halt his forces in Masaka and allow the Ugandan rebels to attack Kampala and overthrow Amin, as he feared that scenes of Tanzanian troops occupying the city would reflect poorly on his country's image abroad. However, Ugandan rebel forces did not have the strength to defeat the incoming Libyan units, so Nyerere decided to use the TPDF to take Kampala. Kampala was secured by the TPDF on 11 April. Combat operations in the country continued until 3 June, when Tanzanian forces reached the Sudanese border and eliminated the last resistance. The TPDF withdrew from Uganda in 1981.

Known for his encyclopaedic knowledge of British prehistory, Jacobi authored several key synthetic volumes and worked to catalogue, sequence and reanalyse collections from across Britain and northwestern Europe. Sections of his extensive personal archive were posthumously published as the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Artefact (PaMELA) database. He studied archaeology at Jesus College, Cambridge, and held positions at Lancaster University, the University of Nottingham, and the British Museum.  Education and career  Jacobi was born in Ealing on 16 February 1947, to an English mother and German father. He attended Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood. There he took an early interest in archaeology, joining both the school's archaeology society and the Prehistoric Society, and volunteering at excavations at a Roman site. He went on to study archaeology and anthropology at the University of Cambridge and completed his doctorate as a fellow of Jesus College. Thomas Higham described Jacobi's doctoral thesis, on Mesolithic Britain, as \\"a monumental and important piece of work that is unlikely to be matched in terms of its detail and broad sweep\\". It was examined by Paul Mellars. After completing his doctorate, Jacobi taught Palaeolithic archaeology at Lancaster University and the University of Nottingham. He left Nottingham in 1994, first for a series of curatorial posts at the British Museum, then from 2001 a permanent research position with the 'Ancient Human Occupation of Britain' project.  Research  Jacobi was known for his encyclopaedic knowledge of British prehistory. He never adopted computers, preferring to maintain his large archive of information from visits to sites and collections across the country in index cards and longhand notes. Starting with his doctoral thesis, he wrote several key synthetic volumes on the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic of the British Isles, including chapters in the Council for British Archaeology's regional series and the Gazetteer of Mesolithic Sites in England and Wales (1977). The latter volume was \\"the most widely available and accessible published data source for the Mesolithic period in Britain\\" for many years, forming the basis of the Mesolithic section of the National Monuments Record, and eventually only superseded with the posthumous publication of Jacobi's personal archive. Much of Jacobi's work involved reanalysing old collections. He discovered one of the two known Aurignacian bone points in Britain during a visit to the Bristol Museum, misidentified amongst a collection of stone tools. On another occasion, he was able to refit two pieces of chipped stone from entirely different collections. He also used archival research to reconstruction the history of excavations at Pinhole Cave and Kents Cavern. From 2006, Jacobi collaborated with the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit to refine the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic chronology of the British Isles and northwestern Europe using the new method of ultrafiltration radiocarbon dating. This work led to several important results, including the dating of sequences from key Palaeolithic sites such as Geißenklösterle, Fumane, La Ferrassie, and Pataud. Jacobi was also active in field archaeology. He excavated at Gough's Cave between 1987 and 1992 and at Happisburgh from 2006 until his death.  Honours and legacy  Jacobi's 2004 paper on the Late Upper Palaeolithic of Gough's Cave won that year's Baguley Award from the Prehistoric Society. Higham described the paper as a \\"magnificent contribution [...] careful, methodical and hugely detailed; the product of years of careful observation and basic hard work.\\" Jacobi died of cancer on 9 December 2009. A memorial event was organised by the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2010. A volume in his memory, No Stone Unturned: Papers in Honour of Roger Jacobi, edited by Nick Ashton and Claire Harris, was published by the Lithic Studies Society in 2015. Proceeds from the sale of the book were used to set up a Jacobi Bursary for members of the Lithic Studies Society. Jacobi maintained an extensive card index of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites, collections, and artefacts. After his death, Wessex Archaeology conducted an English Heritage-funded project to digitise this archive as the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Artefact (PaMELA) database, published in 2014. The physical archive, together with Jacobi's large collection of correspondence, notes, illustrations and photographs, is curated by the British Museum at Franks House.

She was protesting a possible sentence of six months in prison for having tried to enter a public stadium to watch a football game, against the national ban against women at such events. She died a week later of her injuries. Khodayari's self- immolation has generated much debate in Iran about the government's restrictions on women. With Iran chosen to host select qualifier games for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, FIFA has said that Iran must allow women into the stadium to see those international football matches. Iran guaranteed such entry for the first time after 40 years, one month after Sahar’s death. Khodayari has since become a symbol of protest against the Islamic Republic's oppression against women.  Movie  The Recess (2020)also known as Zang -e Tafrih (زنگ تفریح in Persian) is an Iranian narrative short film based on the tragic death of Sahar Khodayari known as Iranian Blue Girl. The Recessis about Sahar, a 17 year old student who is determined to skip high school during \\"the recess\\" to attend the football stadium to watch the sensitive football match between Esteghlal F.C. vs. Al-Ain as part of AFC Champions League against the national ban on women to enter football stadiums in Iran. Incident and suicide Sahar Khodayari was born in 1990 to a family in Salm, Kiar County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran. Her family includes a sister. The family later lived in Tehran. Khodayari graduated from university with degrees in English and in computer sciences. As a young woman she became a fan of the game of football. She was identified as \\"Blue Girl\\" on social media, after the colors of her favorite club, Esteghlal FC, based in Tehran. In March 2019 Khodayari tried to enter Azadi Stadium for a match of AFC Champions League between Esteghlal and Al Ain FC. Because women in Iran have been prohibited since 1981 from attending football matches, she disguised herself as a man to enter undetected. (Women may attend other sports, such as volleyball matches.) But the security guards noticed Khodayari and arrested her for violating the prohibition; they took her to the local NAJA. She was held for three nights in jail before being released on bail, pending her court case. According to Amnesty International, Sahar Khodayari was ordered six months later to attend a Revolutionary Court in Tehran on 2 September 2019 to give a reason for her attempt to enter Azadi football stadium. She was charged with \\"openly committing a sinful act by… appearing in public without a hijab\\" and \\"insulting officials\\". While no verdict was delivered in her case because the judge was unavailable, she was reportedly told she might face a six-month jail sentence. After Khodayari left the court, she poured petrol on herself and set herself on fire outside the courthouse in self-immolation. She died in hospital one week later due to the third-degree burns that she had suffered (approximately 90% of her skin surface area had been affected). According to DW, the six-month jail sentence had been affirmed while she was in hospital. In October 2019, Iranian women were allowed to attend a soccer match in Iran for the first time in 40 years. Reactions = National = * Gholam Hossein Ismaili, the spokesman of judicial system of Iran, claimed that Sahar Khodayari had not been convicted nor sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment, as was reported. He said that the media had published \\"rumor\\" that was not true. *In an interview with the state-owned TV, before her family was told not to speak to the media, her sister had said that Khodayari was receiving treatment for mental illness. There were rumors that she had tried to take her life as a university student. Because of this, authorities might have reduced charges against her, if they had chosen to do so. * Ali Karimi said that Iranians should \\"boycott soccer stadiums to protest Khodayari's death.\\" = Worldwide reaction = * FIFA made a statement about Khodayari's death: \\"We are aware of that tragedy and deeply regret it.\\" Iran has been chosen as a site for qualifier matches for the 2022 World Cup, and FIFA has said the country must provide for free entry of women to those international matches. * Amnesty International said, \\"What happened to Sahar Khodayari is heart-breaking and exposes the impact of the Iranian authorities' appalling contempt for women's rights in the country.\\" * A spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said: \\"The death of blue girl, Sahar Khodayari, is another proof for the fact that the Iranian people are the greatest victims of the Islamic regime.\\" * On 12 September 2019 an arrest warrant was issued for Saba Kamali, an Iranian actress, after her post on Instagram in support for the death of the Blue Girl. She had published an imaginary dialogue with Husayn ibn Ali questioning the relevance of the ceremonial Ashura event compared to Iran's discriminatory laws. *According to france24, Iranian football fans reacted with shock and anger following Khodayari's death.

Born into an overseas Chinese family in the Philippines and educated in the United States, he moved to China in the 1930s and served in both the Kuomintang and the Communist governments. Considered the founder of chemical metallurgy in China, he was elected a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1955 and established the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy (now Institute of Process Engineering) of the CAS in 1958. He was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and died in prison after five years of incarceration.  Early life and career in the United States  Ye Zhupei (or Yap Chu-Phay in Hokkien) was born in 1902 in Manila, American Philippines, into an overseas Chinese family that originated from Xiamen, Fujian. His father, Ye Duxing (), was a businessman and follower of the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen. He entered Colorado School of Mines in the United States in 1921, and subsequently earned an M.S. from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. in physical chemistry of metals from the University of Pennsylvania in 1929. Ye worked as an engineer for Union Carbide and Central Alloy Steel Corporation, and later as engineer and director of the metallurgy department of American Machine and Foundry Company. While in the US, he published more than 10 papers in scientific journals and developed the use of thermodynamics in the study of iron-carbon alloys, which attracted much attention from metallurgists.  Republic of China  In 1933, Ye moved to the Republic of China to serve in the National Defense Design Council of the Kuomintang government in Nanjing. He was appointed director of the laboratory for metallurgy, which was established at his suggestion. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Ye relocated with the Kuomintang government to the wartime capital of Chongqing, where he led the production of strategic materials, such as electrolytic copper and special steel, which were urgently needed for the war effort. After the 1941 New Fourth Army incident, during which the Kuomintang attacked the New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party, their nominal ally in the Anti- Japanese War, Ye arranged for the Communist leader Zhou Enlai to secretly meet the British embassy to impart the Communists' version of events. He also donated funds to support the Communist headquarters in Yan'an. In 1944, Ye visited Europe and the United States to catch up with technological advances in the developed world. After the end of World War II, he served as vice director of the science committee of UNESCO, under director Joseph Needham.  People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Ye moved to China in 1950 with his wife Marcelia and their one- year-old son. He was elected a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1955. In 1958, he established the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy (now Institute of Process Engineering) of the CAS and served as the founding director. In addition, he recruited Chen Jiayong to help develop hydrometallurgy at the institute. After examining the shortcomings of China's steel industry, Ye suggested the application of the \\"three high method\\": high pressure, temperature, and humidity, and Shijingshan Steel built a test furnace according to his specification. He also solved key technical problems at Panzhihua Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel. He published more than 100 papers and won multiple State Science and Technology Prizes. However, many of his far-sighted proposals were not adopted at the time. He advocated the development of oxygen converter process for steelmaking, but others insisted on building large open hearth furnaces, a technology that was becoming obsolete. He advocated the use of computers for metallurgical research, and was ostracized by those who could not understand the connection. In 1952, he proposed simultaneous mining of iron ore and rare earths at the Bayan Obo mine, whereas Soviet experts preferred to focus on iron ore only. The Chinese government adopted the Soviet proposal, and only came to fully realize the value of the rare earth resources of Bayan Obo decades later. Ye was elected a member of the 2nd and 3rd National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). In 1964, he was elected a Standing Committee member of the 3rd National People's Congress. When the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, however, he was persecuted and imprisoned by the Red Guards. He spent the final five years of his life in custody, during which time he wrote technical papers and proposals totaling 200,000 words. He suffered from colon cancer and died in prison on 24 November 1971.  Legacy  Ye was posthumously rehabilitated after the end of the Cultural Revolution and recognized as the founder of chemical metallurgy in China. On 10 July 1978, a grand ceremony was held for his interment at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing. Vice Premier Fang Yi, who presided over the ceremony, declared him the \\"People's Scientist\\". In articles published in 1987 in Ye's memory, the prominent scientist Yan Jici praised his contributions to China which went far beyond the field of metallurgy, the entrepreneurial spirit that his career was imbued with, and his devotion to truth even under extremely difficult circumstances.  Personal life  While a visiting scientist in New York City, Ye Zhupei met his wife Marcelia Vance Yeh, an Irish-American from Ohio, through their friends Toshi and Pete Seeger. They had a son, Kippy, and moved to China when he was a year old. In China Marcelia gave birth to two daughters, Suzanna and Cathy. She taught English at Yenching University, which later merged into Peking University, for 25 years. Among her students were many high-ranking Chinese and Korean officials, including Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing. After retiring in 1976 at age 60, she returned to the United States and earned a master's degree in creative writing from University of California, Berkeley. She became a writer, publishing short stories and the poetry collection Hillegass Street, and later returned to teach at Peking University for another semester.

The first part of the book, The Temper of our Times consists of three chapters. First chapter, Our Liberating Nineties, talks about economic liberation of India and how India changed in those transition period. The second chapter, Understanding our Times, is about learning lessons from the economic history of India and mistakes to avoid. The last chapter, What is Wrong with our Temper, is about asking questions to Indians why their temper is so low. The second part of the book, Private Space, starts with the chapter called Laptops and Meditation which deals with balancing personal life and work. Next chapter is A Sentimental Education which is about educational values like how to write and how to read well and commitment to liberal values, followed by chapter Playing To Win in which Das shows steps on how to win in a competitive market. The last and third part of the book is Public Space. Seventh chapter Learning to live, living to learn is about reforms needed by Indian education system. Eighth chapter deals with agricultural reforms which are required in India and how local self-government should work in rural India. To reform or Not to reform is the ninth chapter of a book in which the author blames poor governance of India and their weak advocacy to reform. Tenth chapter namely What slows us down deals with connection of capitalism with democracy and subsequently, last chapter, making the nation competitive discusses the issue of competitiveness in the open market from the perspective of political leaders aka policy makers of India.  Overview  As a sequel to India Unbound, this book is collection of 11 essays which are seguing from one to another within each section. The Elephant Paradigm is about an ancient civilization's reawakening to the spirit and potential of its youth and ranges over a vast area and covering subjects as varied as panchayati raj, national competitiveness, and the sacred and philosophical concerns of the average Indian consequent to India's entry into what the author calls the 'age of liberation'. Das argues that India may never roar ahead like the Asian tigers but it will advance like a wise elephant which is moving steadily and surely, pausing occasionally to reflect on its past and to enjoy the journey.  Reception  N. R. Narayana Murthy, at the launch of the event, said that every civil servant should be made to read it.

Background Ashidaa was the commander of the Ashidaa Mujahideen Brigade which was first publicly noticed in 2014, however the Ashidaa Mujahideen Brigade was established in 2012, with his brother Abu Ahmad al-Halabi, he was also associated with Suqour al-Sham and served as Suqour al-Sham's religious advisor. In 2013 the group joined Ahrar al-Sham and remained part of it until defecting from the Ahrar al-Sham in 2016 in response to Ahrar al-Sham's involvement in Operation Euphrates Shield which drew manpower away from Aleppo to other areas in northern Syria to fight ISIL and the Syrian Democratic Forces alongside the Turkish military, despite several recent loses in Aleppo to pro-government forces in the area at the time. The group was based in the Sukkari area of Aleppo and has been accused of flogging individuals for not attending Friday prayers. After the flogging incident, Ahrar al-Sham denied involvement in it, causing the Ashidaa Mujahideen Brigade to temporarily leave Ahrar al-Sham for Harakat Fajr ash-Sham al-Islamiya, however the group later rejoined Ahrar al- Sham. During his leadership over the Ashidaa brigade which was part of Ahrar al-Sham, he attracted Egyptian recruits based in rural Aleppo who organized Dawah campaigns, including Abu Yaqdhan al-Masri who later became a prominent religious official in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Biography On 1 December 2016, after suffering several set backs and losses in Aleppo, Ashidaa was made the Emir of the Army of Aleppo rebel alliance in the besieged rebel pocket in eastern Aleppo. After the rebel loss in Aleppo, he blamed several unnamed rebel groups of hoarding supplies that would later end up unused and thus falling into the hands of the Syrian government, as well as claiming that several of the rebel groups had been infiltrated by agents from the Syrian government, as well as groups backed by foreign states, claiming they were ordered withdraw from Aleppo in order to take part in Operation Euphrates Shield. In 2017 after the formation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Ashidaa joined the group was made the leader of the group's branch in western Aleppo, known as the Army of Umar Ibn Khattab. On 9 September 2019, Ashidaa released a video criticizing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, saying that the group was corrupt internally and called upon its members to launch a revolt from within while calling its leadership tyrannical and had taken part in the seizure of property and monopolizing the local economy in its own favor and inadequately spending on its military activities, being incompetent in the defense of rebel held areas as a result. The next day he was reportedly dismissed from his position as the leader of the Army of Umar Ibn Khattab by HTS and would face punishment from the leadership of HTS. On 12 September 2019, he was arrested by HTS for charges of slander and inciting division in HTS as well as leaking potentially damaging information publicly, that HTS claimed could benefit its enemies. Ashidaa has since remained in HTS custody as of 17 September 2019, and is reportedly being held under close supervision and his family is not allowed to communicate with him, by HTS. In 2020, during the late 2019-early 2020 Syrian government's offensive in Idlib he was released from prison by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and formed his own group called the \\"Jihad Coordination\\", and stated that the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading as a result of moral corruption and cited Hadiths regarding the spread of viruses as a punishment of God.

Designed by Hans Price and William Wooler, it was built in 1883–84 and has been a Grade II listed building since 1983. Today the church is in a local ecumenical partnership with Sandford Methodist Church. History All Saints was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St James in Winscombe. Plans for the establishment of a church at Sandford originated with the offer of a plot of land by the Dean and Chapter of Wells, but it was not until 1882 that fundraising began through the efforts of the vicar of Winscombe, Rev. R. F. Follett, and others. A circular was issued in February 1882 detailing the need for a church and resident clergyman at Sandford. At the time, the hamlet and its surrounding area had a population of over 400, with most inhabitants being two to three miles from the parish church. A committee was formed, made up of the vicar and churchwardens of Winscombe, the Rev. Prebendary Stephenson (rural dean), Mr. Poole of Underhill Farm and Mr. Reece of Winscombe. The appeal, which aimed to raise £1,000, was successful in generating funds by public subscription, with major donors including Mr. Sidney Hall of Langford House, Mrs. A. G. Lethbridge and Rev. J. A. Yatman. A grant was also received from the Incorporated Church Building Society. The plans for the chuch, drawn up by Messrs Price and Wooler of Weston-super-Mare, were approved in December 1882, and Mr. James Wilcox of Weston-super-Mare was hired as the building contractor in February 1883. Construction commenced soon after and the church was consecrated on 10 January 1884 by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Lord Arthur Hervey. The church cost an approximate £1,100 to build, £850 of which had been raised by the time of its consecration. Architecture All Saints is built of local stone, with dressings in Bath stone and plain tiles on the roof, in the Perpendicular style. It was designed for 100 persons and made up of a two-bay nave, chancel, vestry and west porch. A bellcote tower is located on the west side of the building. Many of the original fittings are of polished pitch pine, except the doors of oak and the wagon roof of stained red Baltic timber. The flooring is all of timber, except the aisle and chancel floor which are laid with tiles. The church's furniture was gifted by Rev. P. Willis, late curate of Axbridge. The carved work was carried out by Harry Hems of Exeter and the ornamental glass windows supplied by Messrs Joseph Bell of Bristol.

Biography  Emeritus research director at the CNRS, he is known for his work in the field of ultra-high resolution laser spectroscopy. He invented and developed saturation spectroscopy, which he used to study many new and fundamental effects in molecular physics. Its name is attached to the design of a whole class of atomic interferometers based on the recoil effect, which make it possible to produce optical clocks, measure atomic masses and probe the properties of space-time. In particular, he demonstrated that these interferometers allowed very accurate measurement of the fields of inertia. The proximity of its work to the field of metrology has led it to preside on several occasions, on behalf of the French Academy of Sciences, over the meetings of the General Conference on Weights and Measures, the executive organ of the Metre Convention. He is a founding member of the French Academy of Technologies and Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur.

Retweets are not included. The Volfefe Index is a stock market index of volatility in market sentiment for US Treasury bonds caused by tweets by President Donald Trump. Bloomberg News observed Volfefe was created due to the statistical significance of Trump tweets on bond prices. ABC News Online posited Volfefe could help analyze interest rate risk in the face of \\"unpredictable\\" activity on social media by Trump. Etymology The name \\"Volfefe\\" references the \\"covfefe\\" tweet by Trump. Vol stands for volatility. Creation Volfefe was launched by JPMorgan Chase on September 9, 2019. Methods In forming the basis of the methodology behind Volfefe, JPMorgan Chase used software to analyse the corpus of Trump's tweets. 14,000 tweets were used in the analysis to form the initial projections for their software. Their analysts determined that there were direct correlations between tweets and subsequent market movements. These market movements were most notably evidenced when the tweet specifically references financial matters including the US Federal Reserve. The tweets issued during the working day of the New York Stock Exchange were more likely to cause a change in market sentiment; however, it was noted that the tweets can come at any time of day and thus have an effect on markets around the world. Key words in tweets often include \\"China\\", \\"billion\\", \\"products\\", \\"Democrats\\", \\"great\\", \\"dollars\\", \\"tariffs\\" and \\"trade\\". Analysis Bloomberg News noted, \\"JPMorgan’s 'Volfefe Index,' named after Trump’s mysterious covfefe tweet from May 2017, suggests that the president’s electronic musings are having a statistically significant impact on Treasury yields.\\" ABC News Online commented JP Morgan created Volfefe, \\"to measure how much impact Mr Trump's unpredictable tweets have on US interest rates\\".

Retrieved 10 September 2019. and the University of Oxford awarded him the DCL higher doctorate in 1985.  Royal marriage controversy  Interviewed on the BBC Panorama programme on 13 February 2005 Cretney argued that a civil wedding ceremony could not produce a valid marriage between the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker-Bowles. It was inhibited for the same reason that Edward VIII could not marry Mrs Simpson while King, Princess Margaret could not marry Peter Townsend and Princess Anne had to marry Timothy Laurence in a Scottish church. Cretney pointed out that although the 1836 Marriage Act introduced provision for civil weddings, by section 45 it did not apply to the royal family. The Marriage Act 1949 (section 79(5)) confirmed the provision, and (although it repealed some parts of the previous Act) many of them (including section 45) remained in force. Civil marriage could have been extended to the royal family by repealing section 45 while the remaining provisions of the 1836 Act remained in force but this was not done. Rebutting Charles' claim (advanced by four legal experts who refused to give their names) that \\"the 1949 Act is not a continuation of the old legislation. It's a completely new act and therefore does not carry over the bar on royals having civil marriages\\" Cretney stated: > The 1949 Act is a Consolidation Act. A Consolidation Act does not change the > law except in the most minor ways and all it does is to bring together the > versions previously scattered amongst the large number of other acts. He followed up with an article.Stephen Cretney, \\"Royal Marriages: the law in a nutshell\\", Family Law, Jordan Publishing, Bristol [2005 Fam. Law 317-321]. He was supported ten days after the interview by David Pannick QC (as he then was), an administrative law expert who has overturned government interpretation of the law in court on many occasions, and a former attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell QC. Lecturing to the Family Law section of the Society of Legal Scholars in September 2006 Cretney warned of future legal challenges designed to prevent Mrs Parker-Bowles becoming Queen or inheriting from the royal family.

Plot Aman Tripathi is an advertiser who comes from an orthodox middle-class family, comprising his father, Shankar Tripathi, a conservative agricultural scientist who had invented black cauliflowers, for which he is facing constant ridicule and boycott from farmers, his mother, Sunaina Tripathi, a calm housewife who is always concerned about her son, his uncle Chaman and aunt Champa, and their daughter, Rajni \\"Goggle\\" Tripathi and a few more relatives. Aman is in love with Kartik Singh, his long time job partner and friend. One day, Sunaina asks Aman to attend Goggle's wedding. Aman says that he can come only if he gets leave. Sunaina and Shankar intend to marry Aman off to a family friend's daughter, Kusum Nigam, who is besotted with Aman. During this time, Aman and Kartik help the latter's friend, Vedika, run away from home, and after giving her father and his neighbours a wild goose chase, they initially argue but decide to go to Allahabad together. They boarded the train \\"Vivah Express\\" on which Aman's family boarded, and unite. Sometime after changing their attire, Aman and Kartik share a kiss as the train passes through a tunnel, but are caught shamefacedly by Shankar, who ends up vomiting at the sight of his son kissing a man, and falls unconscious. Later, the train halts for long at one of the stations due to ongoing protests along the railway lines ahead, when Kartik suggests to Aman about talking his father on. Sunaina summons a doctor to check Shankar up, but a heated argument ensues between her and Champa. Shankar recovers and recalls the incident but keeps it a secret. When he sees him coming, Shankar aims a water hose at Aman that drenches him. He embraces him up and asks him to stay away from Kartik. At the wedding, Shankar continuously eyes off Aman and Kartik, and has a funny confrontation with the Sunaina, but in a few moments, Kartik and Aman share a kiss publicly, leaving everyone awestruck and helpless. Kartik is then whisked away by Chaman to the railway station, while Shankar blackmails Aman into agreeing to marry Kusum; meanwhile, Ashok refuses to marry Goggle, who then escapes with her horse to the railway station. She tries to commit suicide but Kartik stops her, and they both decide to return home in hopes of winning Aman's respect back. Returning home, Shankar persuades Sunaina to rechristen Aman with a new name in order to cleanse him of his \\"sins\\", but Goggle soon returns, with Kartik reappearing in the Tripathi household. However, Shankar beats him up with a stick. Kartik falls down and gets unconscious. Unable to see this, Aman locks himself up in his room and agrees to marry Kusum under pressure from Shankar, asking the Tripathis not to harm Kartik in return. His family is happy and starts the wedding preparations. Kartik wakes up and finds out about the wedding, trying to convince Aman to avert this mishap. Aman is unable to defy his family, but Kartik then declares that he will leave as soon as the wedding ends. Kusum steals all of Sunaina's jewellery and escapes, leaving behind a letter in Aman's room. Kartik gets his bag to leave and notices the letter. He reads the note and, delighted, dresses up as the bride covering his face. Shankar suspects something is wrong, and inadvertantly chases the \\"bride\\", when Kartik suddenly reveals himself to everyone's surprise. Goggle hands over Kusum's note to Sunaina, sending everyone into a shock. Aman confesses his love for Kartik, but the priest refuses to proceed, considering it \\"unnatural\\" for two guys to marry. At that moment, the police arrives with Kusum to arrest Aman and Kartik as it is illegal to be gay. Sunaina asks Shankar to stop the police, but relents upon seeing Shankar's silence. Shankar, after repenting, tries to stop the police. The police however refuse to leave, so Chaman suggests waiting till the next morning when the Supreme Court will deliver its judgement on the decriminalization of homosexuality. Finally, as positive news hits the headlines that now consensual relation between any two adults would be considered legal, Aman and Kartik embrace, and Shankar decides to burn all of his black cauliflowers. Aman and Kartik get ready to leave for Delhi. Shankar insists on dropping them off at the train station, rebuffing Kartik's wish to ride to the station. Kartik tricks him and drives to the train station. At the station, a tearful reconciliation follows between Kartik and Shankar. Kartik and Aman run to catch the train just in time.

Pallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India praised the cast, writing that \\"if Ayushmann highjacks the film with his infectious energy, a mellow Jitendra balances it out with his poker-faced humour and the relatability factor that he maintains throughout the film\\" and \\"it is noteworthy as to how well the supporting cast renders its complete (and able) support to the lead pair,\\" while critiquing that \\"since the film is primarily invested in the small-town drama pertaining to the taboo around same-sex relationships, the writer-director fails to tap on the elements exclusive to small cities like Allahabad\\" and that \\"while the first half is engaging, the second half loses its sheen pretty early on and could have been trimmed down by a good 20 minutes.\\" Anupama Chopra of Film Companion noted that, \\"Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan wants to be both – an impassioned defense of same-sex love as well as a family entertainer. But the writing can't seamlessly blend the disparate elements.\\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV proclaimed that \\"The comic flights of fancy do not always take off in the right direction or land smoothly, but with the actors going all out to make the film work, some parts of Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan are genuinely funny and quirky. The film may be erratic in parts, but its entertainment quotient is delightfully high for a film tackling a clash between conservatism and freedom, between tradition and modernity.\\" Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times commented that \\"Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is an important film that talks about an important subject conveyed in the simplest manner without sounding preachy at any given point. It touches your heart, makes you laugh and stays with you for a long time.\\" Devesh Sharma of Filmfare gave the film a rating of 4/5 and urged the audience to \\"Watch the film for its hilarious comedy, slick all around performances and ultimately for its powerful message of love and acceptance.\\"  References   External links  Category:2020 films Category:2020 romantic comedy films Category:2020s Hindi-language films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Indian films Category:Hindi- language films Category:Indian sequel films Category:Indian LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related romantic comedy films Category:T-Series films Category:Gay-related films Category:2020 LGBT-related films ","title":"Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"},{"id":"61741194","text":"Ethan Alexander Brookes (born 23 May 2001) is an English cricketer.

Allegedly committing them in the name of the pagan saint San La Muerte, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes. Early life Marcelo, often referred to as \\"Marcelito\\", grew up in an unstable household - his grandmother was an alcoholic, as well as his father Alberto, who also had a drug addiction. His mother frequently beat him, and eventually kicked him out of the house due to Antelo also being heavily addicted to cocaine paste. Abandoned by his parents, he went to live with an uncle he loved dearly, but the man soon died in an assault, leaving little Marcelito alone and helpless. Between the ages of 17 and 19, he entered several rehabilitation centers for his addiction, but all of them proved unsuccessful. At 20, he was kicked out by pregnant girlfriend Brenda after she got tired of him treating her badly. Isolated and homeless, Antelo's drug addiction worsened, as he roamed the Rivadavia social housing complex in Flores neighborhood. He eventually ended up joining a church named the \\"God in Force Church\\", where he engaged in prayers and cultish activities to end his habits, but, yet again, he was unsuccessful. As he frequently fought with drug dealers, Marcelo ended up losing one of his kidneys during a shooting. Crimes On February 21, 2010, Antelo made his attack, shooting Jorge Díaz in the legs during an attempted robbery. Díaz survived, and Marcelo was convicted of robbery and attempted murder, but was released only a short while later. In his subsequent attacks, he struck at night, when there was low visibility and he couldn't be seen. =Rodrigo Ezcurra= A 27-year-old philosophy student who also studied law and once held a job in a court, Ezcurra was a drug addict who lived with his father Horacio in Palermo. Aspiring to turn his life around after a long trip through Mexico, Ezcurra had begun therapy to treat his addiction two months prior to his murder. But on April 11, 2010, at around 2 o'clock in the morning, he came across \\"The Kindergarten Boys\\" in an alleyway, a gang of underage youths led by Marcelo Antelo. They wanted to rob Rodrigo of his possessions, and despite giving into their demands, he was shot in the chest by Antelo, dying on the spot. Ezcurra's bike and cellphone were then stolen by the perpetrators, whom, unbeknownst to them, were seen by several witnesses and even recorded by one. =Attack on Darío Romero= On June 24, Antelo decided to attack Darío, a man who used to live with him. While cruising through the neighborhood, he came across Romero, who was planning to play football in a nearby field. Marcelo shouted out his name, and immediately shot him in the hand with a shotgun. Romero survived, and Antelo was arrested and convicted of causing serious injuries. Again, he was released after some time. =Jorge Mansilla= On August 8, 2010, Antelo wanted to enact revenge upon Jorge Héctor Mansilla, a former flatmate who had kicked him out because of his drug addiction. Marcelito rang the doorbell, and when Mansilla answered, he was swiftly killed. Only a few hours later, Antelo shot mechanic Mario Jorge Quiero, after he attempted to collect debt for a failed arrangement concerning a friend's car. Quiero managed to escape, however, with Marcelito abandoning the idea of finishing him off. =Pablo Zaniuk and Marcelo Cabrera= A few days later, on August 15, Antelo came across two friends, Pablo Zaniuk and Marcelo Cabrera. Using his guns, he shot Zaniuk in the face before killing Cabrera, shooting him a total of nine times in the body. =Suspected victims= Initially, Antelo was to be prosecuted for a fifth murder, that of a man named Santos Valeroso Vargas, but was not convicted in his case. Additionally, he is suspected of, but never charged with, the killings of hobo Pablo Villa and an unidentified young man known simply as \\"El Diablo\\", who were both shot and their bodies subsequently burned. It is possible that Marcelo Antelo might have committed other killings around the area as well. Trial and sentence Near the end of the month, Antelo was captured by police and thrown in prison. His trial started on August 6, 2012, and although only the victims' families were present, some relatives outside had gathered a crowd encouraging a conviction and hurling insults at Antelo, even handing out flyers calling him a murderer. Meanwhile, Marcelo himself denied any responsibility in the killings, accusing the police of \\"planting\\" a 9mm pistol in his house in order to have a scapegoat for the unsolved crimes. He additionally denied believing in a pagan saint. However, the jury weren't convinced, as there was plenty of evidence contradicting his claims, including ballistic expertise and witness testimonies. The judge, Federico Salvá, sentenced him to life imprisonment, which didn't garner any emotional reaction from Antelo.

Khalili over five decades. Together, the collections include some 35,000 works of art, and each is considered among the most important in its field. Among these are the largest private collection of Islamic art, with 28,000 items including 2,000 ceramics and 600 items of jewellery. A separate collection includes around 4,000 objects relating to the Hajj, spanning from the 7th century AD to the present day. From Japan, there are 1,600 items of Meiji era decorative art and another collection of more than 450 kimono, covering a 300-year period. The most comprehensive private collection of enamels, with over 1,300 items, includes items from China, Japan, Europe and Islamic lands. The eight collections also include 100 flatweave textiles from southern Sweden, 100 examples of Spanish damascened metalwork (i.e. with metal inlaid into other metal), and 48 Aramaic documents from 4th century-BC Bactria. These various collections show two themes that commonly motivate private collections: collecting examples of the highest artistic merit and forming complete series. One hundred catalogues and monographs describing the collections are being published. There have been numerous public exhibitions drawn exclusively from the collections, as well as loans of items to heritage institutions.  Collections  = Islamic Art (700–2000) = The Khalili Collections include one of the world's most comprehensive collections of Islamic art and the largest in private hands. The Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art includes 28,000 objects documenting arts from Islamic lands over a period of almost 1400 years. It was described in 1998 as \\"one of the largest and most representative collections of Quranic manuscripts in the world\\" and is the largest private collection. Khalili is motivated by a belief that Islamic art is the most beautiful, yet has been underappreciated by the wider world. The collection has been described as presenting art works of interest to Westerners without abstracting them away from the aesthetic standards of Islamic culture. Khalili defines Islamic art as \\"art produced by Muslim artists for Muslim patrons\\", and only a minority of the items have an explicitly religious purpose. In addition to rare and illustrated manuscripts, the collection includes album and miniature paintings, lacquer, ceramics, glass and rock crystal, metalwork, arms and armour, jewellery, carpets and textiles, over 15,000 coins and architectural elements. The ceramic collection, numbering around 2,000 items, has been described as particularly strong in pottery of the Timurid era and also pottery of pre-Mongol Bamiyan. The jewellery collection includes more than 600 rings, many purely decorative but some with religious inscriptions or having a secular function, such as signet rings. Around two hundred objects relate to medieval Islamic science and medicine, including astronomical instruments for orienting towards Mecca, scales and weights, and supposedly magical items intended for medical use. This collection was the basis in 2008 for the first comprehensive exhibition of Islamic art to be staged in the Middle East, at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi. This was also the largest exhibition of Islamic art held anywhere up to that date. Exhibitions drawing exclusively from the collection have been held at Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris and the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam as well as at many other museums and institutions worldwide. Highlights include pages from some of the most famous manuscripts with Persian miniatures, including the Great Mongol Shahnameh (c. 1330s), 10 folios from the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp (c. 1520), and 59 folios from the oldest manuscript of the Jami al-tawarikh (1314), Rashid-al-Din’s world history. There is also a 13th-century saddle from the era of Genghis Khan, and an astrolabe commissioned by Shah Jahan (1648–58). The Wall Street Journal has said that it is the greatest collection of Islamic Art in existence. According to Edward Gibbs, Chairman of Middle East and India at Sotheby's, it is the best such collection in private hands.

It holds objects and archival documents from all over the Islamic world, from the Umayyad period to the 21st century. It includes over 300 textiles and many other objects such as coins, medals, miniatures, manuscripts and photographs relating to Mecca and Medina. In total, the collection contains approximately 4,000 objects. Highlights include a mahmal (AH 1067 (AD 1656–7)) commissioned by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet IV, coverings for the door of the Kaaba, curtains for the mosque of the Prophet in Medina, covering for the Station of Abraham, the earliest known accurate eyewitness account of Mecca and some of the earliest photographs taken of Mecca and the Hajj, by photography pioneer Mohammed Sadiq Bey.

Together these letters and accounts make up the oldest known correspondence of the administration of Bactria and Sogdiana. The documents, written in Official Aramaic, were likely to originate from the historical city of Balkh and all are dated within a period of less than 30 years, between 353 BC to 324 BC. The newest of the documents was written during Alexander the Great’s early reign in the region, using the name ‘Alexandros’ (‘Iksndrs’) by which he later became known. = Japanese Art of the Meiji Period (1868–1912) = The collection of Meiji decorative arts is only comparable in terms of quality to the collection of the Japanese Imperial family. It comprises over 1,600 pieces, including metalwork, enamels, lacquer, textiles and ceramics. The Meiji period saw a cultural revolution in Japan where traditional tastes were met with international ones. Since the beginning of Emperor Meiji’s reign in Japan, European and international collectors have sought pieces of Japanese art from this era. Many works in the collections were produced by Imperial Court artists and were exhibited at the Great Exhibitions of the late 19th century. Highlights include works by imperial court artists Shibata Zeshin, Namikawa Yasuyuki, Makuzu Kozan, Yabu Meizan, Kano Natsuo, Suzuki Chokichi, and Shirayama Shosai. Exhibitions drawing exclusively from the collection have been held at the British Museum, Israel Museum, Van Gogh Museum, Portland Museum, Moscow Kremlin Museums, and at many other museums and institutions worldwide.

The majority of the pieces in the collection were made for wedding ceremonies in the region. While they played a part in the ceremonies, they were also a reflection of the artistry and skill of the weaver. Their designs often consist of symbolic illustrations of fertility and long life. The entire collection is made up of 100 pieces. In 2008 it was described as \\"the only extensive collection of Swedish flatweaves outside the country\\". Exhibitions drawing exclusively from the collection have been held at the Swedish Cultural Institute in Paris and Boston University Art Gallery. = Spanish Damascene Metalwork (1850–1900) = Iron Cassone, Spain, Eibar, 1871 One of the largest collections of its kind, the Spanish Metalwork collection pays homage to the Zuloaga family, which played a major part in the preservation of damascening in Spain. The collection contains pieces created by Plácido Zuloaga between 1834–1910. Some of the pieces, such as a giant iron cassone, were originally acquired by the 19th-century English collector, Alfred Morrison. The entire collection comprises over 100 pieces,Borg, Alan, \\"Preface\\", in 22 of which are signed by Plácido Zuloaga. At the opening of the Khalili Zuloaga exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, its then director Alan Borg said it was \\"a landmark in the study of 19th century Spanish decorative art\\". Other exhibitions also drawing exclusively from the collection have been held at the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum and Alhambra Palace in Granada. = Enamels of the World (1700–2000) = The collection consists of over 1300 pieces and showcases the global significance and evolution of enamelling, covering a 300-year period. It is the most comprehensive private collection of its kind. The uniqueness of the collection lies in its geographic, artistic and historical range, including pieces from China, Japan, Islamic countries and Europe. Highlights include the enamelled chariot belonging to the Indian Maharaja of Bhavnagar and a painted enamel throne table with the seal mark of the 18th century Chinese Qianlong emperor. Other objects include presentation chargers, jewellery, miniatures and ornamental pieces.

He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences.  Biography  Daniel Kaplan is a physicist working in the fields of condensed matter physics, magnetic resonance and ultra-short pulse laser optics. After graduating from the École Polytechnique (Class of 1960), he joined the Condensed Matter Laboratory headed by Ionel Solomon at the École Polytechnique. He is defending a doctoral thesis on the magnetic resonance of conduction electrons in indium antimonide.Kaplan, D. et Gueron, M., « Résonance magnétique des porteurs chauffés par électrons photoexités dans l’antominiure d’indium », CRAS, 1965, vol. 260, no 10, p. 2766 In parallel, he is exploring new techniques to detect the magnetic resonance of electrons (spin-dependent recombination) and nuclei (nuclear field effect on magnetoresistance).Sapoval, B., Kaplan, D., et Lampel, G., « Measurement of the hyperfine field contribution to quantum transport by NMR excitation », Solid State Communications, 1971, vol. 9, no 18, p. 1591-1593  Professional career  From 1970 to 1972 Daniel Kaplan worked in the USA at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center. He explores, using magnetic resonance, the structure of thin layers of amorphous silicon. It shows that, in pure amorphous silicon, a minimum number of unsatisfied chemical bonds is required to meet the stresses of the structure.Thomas, P. A., Brodsky, M. H., Kaplan, D., et al., « Electron spin resonance of ultrahigh vacuum evaporated amorphous silicon: In situ and ex situ studies », Physical Review B, 1978, vol. 18, no 7, p. 3059 These bond breaks produce paramagnetic sites and the reduction in the number of these sites is always due to additional chemical elements such as hydrogen. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon will later become a basic material for the production of large-area electronic devices such as flat screens or photovoltaic panels. In 1972, he joined the physics laboratory of the Central Research Laboratory of Thomson CSF (now Thales) in Palaiseau. His main research activity is focused on understanding the insulating-metal transition in oxides such as Vanadium Dioxide.D'Haenens, J. P., Kaplan, D., et Merenda, P., « Electron spin resonance in V1-xCrxO2 », Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics, 1975, vol. 8, no 14, p. 2267 The combination of optical, electrical and magnetic resonance measurements clarified the respective roles of the network distortion degeneration lift and the Mott transition in this phase change. At the same time, he is continuing his research on amorphous silicon. It shows that the paramagnetic resonance signals observed on vacuum- cleaved silicon crystal surfaces are due to contamination by small amorphous silicon particles.Kaplan, D., Lepine, D., Petroff, Y., et al., « New ESR Investigation of the Cleaved-Silicon Surface », Physical Review Letters, 1975, vol. 35, no 20, p. 1376 It also demonstrates the process of hydrogenation of pure amorphous silicon layers with hydrogen plasma.Kaplan, D., Sol, N., Velasco, G., et al., « Hydrogenation of evaporated amorphous silicon films by plasma treatment », Applied Physics Letters, 1978, vol. 33, no 5, p. 440-442 In addition, the mechanism of spin-dependent recombination in silicon is elucidated in a theoretical paper published by Kaplan, Solomon, and Mott.Kaplan, D., Solomon, I., et Mott, N. F., « Explanation of the large spin- dependent recombination effect in semiconductors », Journal de Physique Lettres, 1978, vol. 39, no 4, p. 51-54 In 1983, he joined the medical branch of Thomson CSF (Thomson CGR) as Scientific Director. He then supervised research and development in the field of digital radiology, X-ray scanning and magnetic resonance imaging. In 1988, he became head of Thomson CSF's central research laboratory, which conducts research covering computer science, electronic and optical devices and new techniques for consumer electronics. He was President of the French Physical Society between 1992 and 1994. In 1993, he left the Thomson CSF group and created the Alloy company to develop an original way of conducting public-private partnership research. The Alloy company hires young researchers to work in public laboratories, in France or abroad, on industrial projects. Daniel Kaplan plays the role of project manager in these actions. He repeatedly presents this mode of operation and its importance in conferences.Kaplan D. Faire vraiment coopérer chercheurs et industriels. Séminaire de l'innovation. Ecole de Paris du Management, 17 septembre 1997 In 1999, he founded Fastlite with P Tournois to design and manufacture instruments in the field of ultra-short pulse lasers. The company's flagship product will be an original acousto-optical device (Dazzler™) allowing the electronic programming of the spectral phase of these lasers.Kaplan, D. et Tournois, P., « Theory and performance of the acousto optic programmable dispersive filter used for femtosecond laser pulse shaping », Journal de Physique IV (Proceedings). EDP sciences, 2002, p. 69-75 This programming is an essential tool for the implementation of the CPA (Chirped Pulse Amplification) method, invented by Mourou and Strickland (Nobel Prize 2018), which has profoundly transformed the performance of ultra-intense lasers. The company will also invent and commercialize a new method for measuring the temporal form of pulses.Oksenhendler, T., Coudreau, S., Forget, N., Crozatier, V., Grabielle, S.. Herzog, R., Gobert, D., Kaplan, D., « Self- referenced spectral interferometry », Applied Physics B, 2010, vol. 99, no 1-2, p. 7-12 Daniel Kaplan is currently President of Fastlite, which continues to develop its activity in the field of parametric amplification of ultra- short pulses.

At the beginning it was just a small market, later during the reign of King Nangklao (Rama III) it grew into a bigger market, and there was a major improvement in the year 1902. Talat Yot was a large market in the inner Bangkok (Rattanakosin Island) in those days. There was a wide variety of goods trading, such as both fresh and dried foods, flowers, incenses and candles, various Thai desserts, gold and jewelry stores, leather stores, fabric shops. They starting from small stores and successively develop, until the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) therefore became an important trading centre to date. Moreover, there was another important market near Talat Yot called Talat Norarat, a fruit market outside Rattanakosin Island. In the 1970s, Bang Lamphu consists of three main markets, namely Talat Yot, Talat Turian (durian market), and Talat Nana.

He has appeared at major opera houses and festivals, and has made recordings.  Career  Scala was born in Ragusa, Sicily, Italy. Singing in choirs as a teenager inspired his wish to train his voice. He took voice lessons, and listened to recordings of bel canto opera. He then moved to Bologna for professional studies at the Bologna Conservatory. Scala made his debut at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 2006. He has performed leading bel canto roles such as Rossini's Lindoro in L'italiana in Algeri. He appeared as Alberto in L'occasione fa il ladro at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro. With the title role of Mascagni's L'amico Fritz, Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata and Fenton in Falstaff, Scala moved towards more lyric characters. His first German role was Alfred in Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. He appeared as Argirio in Rossini's Tancredi at La Monnaie in Brussels, as Idreno in Semiramide at La Fenice in Venice, and as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's Rigoletto at the Opéra de Marseille and the Macerata Opera. Scala first appeared at the Royal Opera House in 2015 as Ruodi in Rossini's Guglielmo Tell. He performed as Alfredo at the New Zealand Opera in 2017. In September 2019, Scala appeared in the title role of Rossini's Otello at the Oper Frankfurt, alongside Nino Burjanadze as Desdemona. The opera requires at least five tenors, three of whom have to perform demanding coloraturas. A reviewer noted his powerful voice with a slightly dark timbre and ringing high notes (\\"... kräftigem, leicht dunkel eingefärbtem Tenor, der in den Höhen eine enorme Durchschlagskraft besitzt\\"). Another reviewer described the brilliance of his coloraturas up to \\"stratospheric\\" heights, and noted his convincing dramatic portrayal of the character.  Recordings  Scala performed in 2014 the role of Comte Belfiore in Mozart's La finta giardiniera in a production of the Opéra de Lille recorded as DVD, with Emmanuelle Haïm conducting Le Concert d'Astrée. In a 2015 recording of Rossini's Armida, Scala performed the leading role of Rinaldo. A reviewer noted his \\"ringing voice and good runs\\", especially in a trio of three tenors described as \\"fluid and resounding\\" voices. In 2016, he performed in a BBC production of Bellini's first opera, Adelson e Salvini, in a title role with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Daniele Rustioni. The production was recorded.

He is a former student of the École polytechnique (X1956), a member of the Corps des Ponts and a doctor of physical sciences.  Training and career  After attending the Ecole Polytechnique (1956–1958), he entered the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (1959–1961), then was seconded to the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA) (1962–1971), and became a lecturer at the Ecole Polytechnique (1970–1982). He was a tutor on a five-year contract at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton (USA) (1976–1978), seconded to the CNRS as a research master (1971–1983), CNRS research director (1983–2003), then director of the Centre de physique théorique de l'école polytechnique (1985–1995) and finally a professor at the École polytechnique (1983–1992).  Scientific work  Guy Laval's scientific work concerns plasma physics and its applications. First, he demonstrates the need for hydromagnetic energy principles for stability, and finds that the shape of the cross-section of a cylindrical pinch has a strong influence on its stability. Then, using Vlasov-Boltzmann's equations, he demonstrates the instability of a Harris pinch plan. He brings these results closer to the knowledge of the time on the interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind. He then uses intermediate formulations of the plasma evolution equations to calculate the magnetic reconnection in tokamaks, especially for the m=1 mode. Then it evaluates the effects of wave coupling during the quasi- linear evolution of a plasma beam instability in the unidimensional case. It shows that imperfect turbulence or pump wave can have a stabilizing effect for parametric instability but can also restore parametric instability suppressed by plasma inhomogeneity. He shows that a non-linear displacement of the frequency of a daughter wave can make the interaction chaotic, thus limiting the reflectivity of the plasma. It shows that parametric instabilities are strongly modified if the amplitude of the laser wave reaches the relativistic domain and that the generated relativistic electrons are emitted with an angular dispersion that can be problematic for the rapid ignition of targets. Finally, in the operation of Hall effect space thrusters, he found instability that explains the abnormal electronic conductivity that neutralizes the ion beam.

The building was designed by the architect Calvert Vaux, and was completed in 1871 as a restaurant. After a restoration, it serves as one of several visitor centers in Central Park. Location The Dairy is located on the southern side of Central Park just south of the 65th Street transverse road. Adjacent features include the Central Park Carousel and the Heckscher Playground and Ballfields to the west, Sheep Meadow to the northwest, Central Park Mall to the north, Central Park Zoo to the east, The Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary to the southeast, and Wollman Rink to the south. History The Dairy was included in the Greensward Plan, the original plan for the construction of Central Park. Construction began in September 1869. In a progress report written by Olmsted Vaux & Co. to the Department of Public Parks, dated June 6, 1870, the architects stated, \\"The Dairy [is] a stone structure, the cellar of which connects directly with one of the traffic roads, it being the intention that the building should receive its main supplies from the exterior of the park. The Dairy is intended to serve as a refreshment room for adult visitors, and for the furnishing of supplies to parties of children who will congregate in the rustic shelter and in the play-grounds. The completion of this building, as designed in accordance with an estimate prepared in conjunction with the Architect-in-chief, will cost $3,000.\\" The Dairy was incorporated into the Children's District, which was not part of the initial plans for Central Park. The district also included Playmates Arch, Heckscher Playground and Ballfields, the Chess & Checkers House, the now-demolished Children's Cottage, and the Central Park Carousel. As originally planned, the Dairy would be used as a place to buy milk and other small snacks, as well as borrow board games. The cows that provided the milk would be housed in the cottage's basement. However, after an incident regarding the sale of tainted milk, more stringent regulations were instituted in the 1860s. The game loans ultimately became the purview of the Children's Cottage. On the southern facade, a loggia or covered porch allowed visitors to enjoy the nearby Pond; the portion of the pond facing the Dairy is now occupied by Wollman Rink. The building also contains several Gothic Revival elements including a great hall with large church-like windows, a spire, and a roof with a steep pitch. Decline The Dairy was completed in 1871, and following political pressure from legislator William Tweed, was used as a restaurant. In 1921, the restaurant operator Eugene Glenn paid an annual fee of $12,250 for the franchise. In the 1930s, Park Commissioner Robert Moses converted it to a storage facility, and by 1950, the building was in decline. That year, a reporter for The New York Times wrote that, \\"untrimmed tree branches jut into its shingled roof,\\" and \\"leader pipes have long since separated from the gutters and sag uselessly.\\" The loggia of the Dairy was demolished in 1955. The building was later closed altogether due to the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970s. In the interim, it was used as a maintenance shed. Restoration In 1979, the architects Weisberg, Castro Associates, following designs prepared in 1978 by the architect James R. Lamantia (1923–2011), restored the northern half of the structure, a renovation undertaken by the Central Park Community Fund and financed in part by Revlon, Inc. The renovated building reopened on November 17, 1979. In 1981, the newly formed Central Park Conservancy rebuilt the loggia that had been demolished in 1955. The loggia was designed by James R. Lamantia and the firm of Russo + Sonder.Drawings for restoration of Dairy Barn, Phase II, Central Park. James R. Lamantia and Russo & Sonders architects. 1980. 15 sheets. In 2016, the Conservancy started raising funds for the restoration of several structures in Central Park, including the Dairy. The building serves as one of the five Conservancy's visitor centers and also contains a gift shop.

This species clings to its support and moves around by its feet-like cirri.  Morphology  Free arms' brown spotted pinnules on a white central ridge. Like many other Crinoids, C. bella is visually comparable to both a flowering plant and a sea star.Feng, Yunjiang, et al. “Crinoids: Ancient Organisms, Modern Chemistry.” Natural Product Reports, vol. 34, no. 6, 2017, pp. 571–584., doi:10.1039/c6np00093b This criter’s evolutionary morphology has remained fairly constant with minimal changes in their appearance. These small featherstars are predominantly dark brown on their underside. The underside reveals its finger-like brachials and cirri they use to walk and anchor themselves to objects. Arguelles, Carmen C, et al. “Identification of Feather Stars (Echinodermata: Crinoidea: Comatulida) at Subic Bay, Zambales, Philippines.” Philippine Journal of Science, vol. 139, no. 1, June 2010, pp. 51–60.Sadhukhan, Koushik, and C. Raghunathan. “New Record of Five Feather Stars (Class: Crinoidea) from Andaman and Nicobar Islands.” Zoological Survey of India, vol. 2, no. 1, 2012. The centrodorsal plate is the round ‘body’ that holds its brachials and arms together, and averages at 4.181mm in diameter. The mouth is located at the center of this plate. C. bella typically has five short, stiff and stout bifurcating arm bases that radiate from the centrodorsal plate of the comatulid ray, but this number can vary per individual . These arm bases branch out into two ossicles, giving them a total of ten or more free-arms. The longer non-branching portion of the arms makes up the majority of the arm length, much like many other members of the comatulida order. On average these non-branching feathery arms are 8.5cm long for an adult C. bella. Each arm has a long white central ridge with dark brown spotted pinnules that project outwards, and slightly taper inwards at the distal end, much like that of a fern plant. Not all, of their arms are regenerating, but every crinoid will have at least a few that are capable of regeneration.Baumiller, Tomasz K., and Angela Stevenson. “Reconstructing Predation Intensity on Crinoids Using Longitudinal and Cross- Sectional Approaches.” Swiss Journal of Palaeontology, vol. 137, no. 2, 2018, pp. 189–196., doi:10.1007/s13358-018-0169-6. Skeletally, the brachitaxes are composed of two ossicles, with ambulacral appendices. The second pinnule is massive, hard and curved. The basal segment of the proximal pinnules is curved or rounded.  Reproduction & Development  There are male and female sexes of C. bella. These gonochoric crinoids shed their ova or sperm from ruptured pinnules into the water. After fertilisation, their embryos grow into larvae that later sink to a substrate surface, like gorgonian coral. The growing larvae, once attached to a surface undergoes metamorphosis into a small crinoid and remains mostly sessile during growth.  Feeding  The beautiful crinoid is a suspension feeder. They filter feed on marine microorganisms like algae, diatoms, and larvae. They also consume marine snow (detritus). This filtration occurs on their cirri, which is linked to the gut near the mouth and anus on the centrodorsal plate.  Behaviour  C. bella on a gorgonian coral These featherstars are mostly sessile, anchoring themselves to hard substrate surfaces or the sea floor using their cirri ‘legs’. However, they are also free-moving creatures capable of travelling short distances to escape their predators or other threats. As nocturnal critters, they partially hide, sessile, within rocks and corals during the day with their mouths oriented upwards. Though their centrodorsal plate remains sheltered during the day as they wait till night to come out and feed, their free-arms can remain fully exposed in a circular fan-like arrangement outside of their habitat, throughout the day.  Distribution & Habitat  233x233px C. bella typically occupies shallow tropical waters,Baumiller, Tomasz K., and Forest J. Gahn. “Reconstructing Predation Pressure on Crinoids: Estimating Arm-Loss Rates from Regenerating Arms.” Paleobiology, vol. 39, no. 1, 2013, pp. 40–51., doi:10.1666/0094-8373-39.1.40. living in open-surfaces Tinkova, T.

They are more commonly located around large coral species in coral reefs, and sometimes found in the intertidal zone. However, in rare cases, they have been found to establish habitat in the deeper ocean (up to 55mJeng, M.-S. 1998 Shallow-water echinoderms of Taiping Island in the South China Sea. Zoological Studies 37(2):137-153.). These featherstars are often exposed on top of a gorgonian coral, under a reef flat, or clinging to sea whips. This shallow water species is present in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, thriving around South and South East Asia: India, the Philippines, China, South Japan, the Maldives, South Pacific Islands. C. bella has also been found in the Great Barrier reef.  Threat & Survival Adaptations  Being mainly sessile creatures, the C. bella is highly susceptible to predators like large fish and other marine organisms. They may also lose limbs due to abiotic stressors like great salinity and temperature fluctuations. On average, the feather-star is reported to lose an arm every 8 to12 days . As a survival mechanism, this crinoid has evolved to be able to lose and regenerate lost limbs, much like a sea-star. Their pinules are also spiked to protect them from predators .In addition, C. bella are able to produce aversive tasting and toxic chemicals to deter predators from consuming their arms that remain exposed out of their habitat throughout the day. The deterrent taste not only provides immediate protection from their predators but also forms long-term negative conditioning to prevent large fish from attacking again . These antifeedant chemicals also provide the beautiful crinoid’s colour.

Its exact location is still under study. History Agathias derives the ancient name ' from a branch of the Hunnic Onoguri, who had been defeated in this place by the local Colchians and thus the town was named after them. According to Agathias, there was a church in the town dedicated to St Stephen, after whom the city was renamed. The Sasanian commander Mihr-Mihroe had fortified this town during his unsuccessful Siege of Archaeopolis. The Byzantines unsuccessfully besieged the fort in 554-555. Identification Kaukhchishvili (1963) links the name \\"Onoguris\\" with that of the Unagira Mountain and locate the town on halfway between Tsikhegoji- Archaeopolis in the west and Kutaisi in the east. He also identifies the town with the fortress Ukimerion (also Uthimereos). During the Nokalakevi expedition in the 1980s, archaeological excavations were undertook at the Abedati Fortress (), Martvili Municipality, and later research papers linked it with Onoguris. However, Pailodze (2003) and Lomitashvili (2003) have separately criticized this identification. Lekvinadzehas as well as Braund & Sinclair (2000) identified the town with modern Sepieti village, based on a 6th- or 7th-century Greek inscription addressing Saint Stephen in a basilica there. Nogela River Pailodze (2003) reported unexcavated remains on the hill at Khuntsi, and suggested them to be possible remains of Onoguris. There is also a river nearby, the Nogela River (Tskhenistsqali). In 2015, a small team from the Anglo-Georgian Expedition to Nokalakevi undertook an excavation of the site which they called Khuntsistsikhe (\\"the fortress of Khuntsi\\") which strengthen the identification, though they say more studies are needed to reach a conclusion.

Dodgson enrolled in the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford at the age of 15 and went on to study at the Royal Academy Schools in London and also briefly at the Slade School of Art. In 1913 she married the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, Campbell Dodgson. Dodgson did not develop her own art until the early 1930s. From 1933 to 1945 she exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy in London. She exhibited mainly portrait pieces, including one of her husband in 1933 and then of Dean Inge and Sir Thomas Barlow in subsequent years. Two solo exhibitions of Dodgson's work were held at Colnaghis' Gallery in London, in 1936 and 1939. Dodgson refused several offers of portrait commissions, preferring to ask friends and family members to sit for her. Later she made a series of drawings of dancers at the Covent Garden Opera and some landscape sketches of Regent's Park in London.

She is a Distinguished professor of paediatrics at the University of Sydney and the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Westmead, and regarded as a \\"pioneer in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, advocacy and patient care\\". Elliott is the Founder and Director of the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit, which conducts research on rare childhood diseases, and she holds a Practitioner Research Fellowship from the NHMRC (National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia).  Early life  Elliott was raised in a family of medical practitioners, with a mother who worked with disabled children, a father who was an obstetrician, and a grandfather who set up resources for mobile medics. She worked in her first paediatric job at Blacktown Hospital and then worked in the UK in the 1980s. Elliott went to SCEGGS Darlinghurst for her high school education. She obtained her MPhil Public Health from the University of Sydney, Doctorate of medicine, and MBBS from University of Sydney. She obtained her FRCPCH from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, UK, FRCO from Royal College of Physicians, London, and RACP from Royal Australian College of Physicians.  Career  She has worked in paediatric health, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. In addition, Elliott visited Christmas Island with a team of medical professionals to determine the health of children, who were asylum seekers and refugees in detention. Invited by Professor Gillian Triggs, the team interviewed over 200 children, including unaccompanied minors, and reported on their physical and mental health, including the presence of respiratory viruses, and instances of self-harm among parents and children. This led to her publishing her findings for the Australian Human Rights Commission on the “health and well-being of children in immigration detention”. She has worked on the health of indigenous populations in Western Australia, and Asia. She also is part of a team travelling to Vietnam to improve health outcomes, with a combination of research and clinical work.

She is also head of the Welsh Local Government Association, a role she has held since 2017. In September 2019, it was announced that she would be made a Labour life peer in the 2019 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours and would be stepping down as Council Leader.  Early life  Wilcox was born in Pontypridd in 1969. She studied for a BEd Drama and Education at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama between 1975 and 1979, followed by a MA in Media Studies at University of Wales, Cardiff between 1994 and 1997.  Teaching career  She began her career as a teacher, initially at Hawthorn High School as well as spells teaching in the Newport area for 30 years including at Hartridge High School, Duffryn High School, and Maindee Primary School.

In 2017 she became the first female Leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, succeeding Cllr Bob Wellington OBE, the former leader of Torfaen County Borough Council. As part of her new role, Wilcox spoke to BBC Wales to criticise the \\"abuse of councillors on social media\\" prompted by reactions to cuts to public services. She stated that, while councillors should be open to fair criticism and scrutiny, the situation was \\"becoming unsafe\\". It came after Bridgend County Borough Councillor Sadie Vidal was told she \\"would be torn apart by fox hounds\\" and Flintshire County Council Deputy Leader Bernie Attridge was threatened along with his children after the closure of John Summers High School in the area in 2015. The WLGA stated it is looking at ways to \\"protect councillors from online and face-to- face abuse, including potential legislation.\\" In 2018, she became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2019 she was criticised by Conservative councillors for spending £11,397 on \\"chauffeur driven cars\\" out of a total Council budget of £81,415 on such vehicles. Having been announced as a life peer, in September 2019, Wilcox informed a meeting of the full council that she would be stepping down as Council Leader, at least in the short term, in order to focus on her role in the Lords. =House of Lords= In September 2019, it was announced that she would be made a Labour life peer in the 2019 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours. She is referred to widely as Baroness Wilcox, but takes the exact name, style and title of Baroness Wilcox of Newport. On 4 November 2019, she was introduced to the House. Since 2 March 2020, she has served as an opposition whip.  Personal life  Wilcox is openly gay, and was shortlisted by Pride Cymru/Wales Online's Pinc List which \\"recognises the most influential LGBT+ people in Wales\\".

The statute was repealed in September 2003 by the Local Government Act 2003.

Discovery and history Since 1972, bones of large azhdarchids have been reported from Alberta, representing the first pterosaur finds from Canada.Russell, D.A. 1972. \\"A pterosaur from the Oldman Formation (Cretaceous) of Alberta\\". Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 9: 1338–1340 These were sometimes referred to a Quetzalcoatlus sp.Currie, P.J., and D.A. Russell. 1982. \\"A giant pterosaur (Reptilia: Archosauria) from the Judith River (Oldman) Formation of Alberta\\". Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 19: 894–897 Later research by Michael Habib indicated that they represented a taxon new to science. In 2019, the type species Cryodrakon boreas was named and described by David William Elliott Hone, Michael Habib and François Therrien. The generic name is derived from the Greek κρύος, kryos, \\"icy cold\\", and δράκων, drakon, \\"dragon\\". The specific name means \\"belonging to Boreas, the north wind\\", or simply \\"northern\\". Habib had considered the name Cryodrakon viserion, as a reference to the ice dragon in Game of Thrones. The holotype, TMP 1992.83, was found in a layer of the Dinosaur Park Formation dating from the late Campanian. The layer is between 76.7 and 74.3 million years old, with the excavation site being located near the lower or older boundary of this range. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains a fourth neck vertebra, a rib, a humerus, a pteroid bone, a fourth metacarpal, a shinbone and a metatarsal. In 1992, the skeleton was excavated in Quarry Q207 and in 1995 reported and partially described.Currie, P.J., and A.R. Jacobsen. 1995. \\"An azhdarchid pterosaur eaten by a velociraptorine theropod\\". Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 32: 922–925 Its bones were not articulated but associated. It represents an immature individual. It is the only pterosaur skeleton, as opposed to single bones, ever found in Canada. It was described in more detail in 2005.Currie, P.J., and E.B. Koppelhus (eds.). 2005. Dinosaur Provincial Park: A Spectacular Ancient Ecosystem Revealed. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana, 672 pp All the known azhdarchid material from the Dinosaur Park Formation was referred to the species. The specimens consisted of the neck vertebrae TMP 1996.12.369, TMP 1981.16.107, TMP 1980.16.1367, TMP 1989.36.254 and TMP 1993.40.11; the scapulocoracoid TMP 1981.16.182; the ulna TMP 1965.14.398; fourth metacarpals TMP 1979.14.24, TMP 1987.36.16 and TMP 2005.12.156; wing finger phalanges TMP 1972.1.1, TMP 1982.19.295 and TMP 1992.36.936; and the thighbone TMP 1988.36.92. The bones represent individuals of various biological ages, among them juveniles and a large mature exemplar. Most bones are from medium-sized animals. In 2019, only the neck vertebrae were described in detail; bones from other parts of the body had already been treated in 2005. Description The material indicates individuals of varying size. Specimen TMP 1996.12.369, a fifth neck vertebra with a length of only , is from a juvenile animal with an estimated wingspan of about . Most bones, among them the holotype, are similar in dimensions to those of Quetzalcoatlus sp., implying a wingspan of about . Specimen TMP 1980.16.1367 is a fifth neck vertebra with an estimated original length of , indicating an animal equal in size to the holotype of Quetzalcoatlus northropi, the wingspan of which has been estimated at . In 1982, this vertebra was misidentified as a thighbone of a pterosaur that had a wingspan of . Cryodrakon was proportionally similar to Quetzalcoatlus and other long-necked advanced azhdarchids, though its somewhat more robust bones may indicate that it was slightly heavier. Cryodrakon is distinguished from all other known azhdarchids by two features of its neck vertebrae. The lateral pneumatic fossae or pneumatopores, a pair of small openings leading to air pockets on either side of the neural canal, were positioned near the lower edge of the neural canal, while those of other azhdarchids (with the purported exception of Eurazhdarcho) were positioned higher up. The second distinguishing feature related to its postexapophyses, large bony knobs adjacent to the protruding rear connection surface of each vertebra, the cotyle. Cryodrakon's postexapophyses were prominent in width but short in length, clearly separated from the cotyle, and their facets were directed downwards. Phylogeny Cryodrakon was placed in the Azhdarchidae in 2019. No exact cladistic analysis was given clarifying the precise relationships with other azhdarchids. It would have been one of the oldest known azhdarchids of North-America.

Quéré is Professor Emeritus at the École Polytechnique, where he was elected President of the Department of Physics and President of the Senate of Professors, and then appointed Director of Education.  Biography and personal life  A mining engineer (Paris) with a doctorate in science, he worked at the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique and then at the École polytechnique In 1961, he married France Jaulmes, a writer and theologian. They have three children. With Jean-Michel Molkhou, Philip Boenhoffer and Frédéric Fortineau, he won a 1st Prize at the CEM (European Chamber Music Competition).  Scientific work  His research is on the physics of materials and in particular on the study of the interaction of particles with solids and the effects of irradiation, placing his work at the border between academic research and applications. This work focused on: * The effects of radiation on solids. Having discovered the phenomenon of very low-temperature growth of uranium irradiated by neutrons and explained theoretically (with Jean Blin) the \\"exaggerated swelling\\" by fission gases in nuclear fuels, he developed (with Florence Rullier) the selective displacement of atoms in a binary alloy, notably superconductor and studied (with Jean Leteurtre, Libero Zuppiroli and Jacques Dural) the \\"induced flow\\" (by irradiation) of various metallic and ionic materials. * The study of punctual defects in metals and in particular that of gaps in silver. He discovered and studied the strong interaction with the included oxygen atoms. * The channelling of protons and alpha particles into crystals. Having developed (with Jean Mory and Georges Désarmot) the \\"canaligraphic\\" method, he demonstrated the decanalising power of most crystalline defects, and in particular the dislocations for which he established the theory and measured the effect. * The development (with René Boucher et al.) of long-lasting batteries for pacemakers and various anti-tumour devices based on transuranic elements. Honours Member of the French Academy of Sciences since 18 February 1991, he was its delegate for international relations for eight years. Yves Quéré was elected in 2000 as co-chair of the InterAcademy Panel (IAP), which is the assembly of the 100 or so Academies of Science around the world.

HuffPost called it \\"a Memphis staple\\".  Preparation and serving  Barbecue spaghetti can be made with pulled pork or shredded smoked pork. The sauce is \\"half marinara and half barbecue sauce\\", sometimes with onions and peppers included, and is simmered before adding the pork; the consistency is close to that of barbecue sauce. The spaghetti is cooked until soft, then tossed in the hot sauce. This dish is served as a side and sometimes as a main course.  History  The dish was invented by former railroad cook Brady Vincent, who opened a barbecue restaurant called Brady and Lil's. In 1980 Frank and Hazel Vernon bought the restaurant and renamed it The Bar-B-Q Shop. Vincent also taught the recipe for barbecue spaghetti to Jim Neely, who opened Interstate Bar-B-Q in the late 1970s; Interstate modified the sauce recipe adding the \\"extra back flap meat\\" from a rack of ribs and cooking it in a pot with peppers and onions.

She was the first woman to become art director and picture editor of a metropolitan newspaper and the first to be accepted to membership in the prestigious White House Press Corps. She was also the first woman to be hired as sports editor at a major metropolitan daily paper and first, or one of the first, to manage and coach a professional basketball team. She achieved recognition as the first official photographer and public relations officer for the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and the first to wear a WAAC uniform. She received awards for her photography, for her work as a war correspondent, and for her internationally-recognized lifetime achievements in journalism. Education Martin was educated in the public schools of Washington, D.C. The curator of a 1986 exhibit called \\"Jackie Martin, The Washington Years\\" wrote that after convincing the administration to allow it she became the first girl in her elementary school to take an industrial arts class. She attended Eastern High School between 1918 and 1921 and upon graduating received an athletic scholarship amounting to a year's college tuition. Lacking money to pay room, board, and other essentials that were not covered by the scholarship, she spent a year working in a sequence of retail jobs, including one as editor of a department store magazine. In the fall of 1922 Martin enrolled in Syracuse University and during her freshman year she earned letters in basketball, track, and rifle shooting. Although she took jobs on campus and set up a laundry pick-up service, she was unable to earn enough money to continue beyond the first year. Early career as a journalist Martin became a professional journalist at age 20 when, having returned home from Syracuse, she used her experience as editor and athlete to obtain the position of sports editor for the Washington Times. In 1969 her obituary stated that in taking the job she became the first ever woman sports editor at a daily paper, however, it is more accurate to say that she was the first woman editor of a major metropolitan daily since in 1906 a woman named Ina Eloise Young had become \\"sporting editor\\" of the Chronicle-News of Trinidad, Colorado. During 1925 and 1926, while still working at the Times, Martin also worked as society editor in the Washington office of a photo publishing and news photography company called Underwood & Underwood. It was during this time that she learned the basics of photojournalism. In 1926 she left Underwood & Underwood and shifted from sports editor on the Times to a three-month position as staff photographer in the joint newsroom of the Times and its sister publication the Washington Herald. During 1928 and 1929 she spent another few months as the Herald's assistant society editor. In March 1929 Martin joined the Washington Daily News and for the next year and a half was one of its staff photographers and feature news reporters while also handling special editions and filling in as society editor. Career as a sportswoman While she was sports editor of the Times and society editor at Underwood & Underwood Martin had a third job as publicity manager for a women's sports club, the Metropolitan Athletic Club, and was a starting member of its basketball team, the Mets. The team had an unbeaten season in 1924, thus earning recognition as District of Columbia basketball champions. During this time she was an officer of the organization that coordinated women's basketball locally and in addition to all her other activities she taught basketball classes two evenings a week in a local gym. On leaving her job as staff photographer for the Times and Herald in 1927, Martin became manager and publicist for a multipurpose arena sports arena that aimed to be the \\"Madison Square Garden of Washington.\\" At this time she was also manager and coach of a women's professional basketball team, the Arcadians, which played its home games at the arena. The team attracted local notice by playing local boys' teams using men's rules. They competed in preliminary events before games of the men's professional teams and were said to be one of the first if not the first professional women's team. Martin hoped to compete in half-mile event of the 1928 Olympics, the first in which women would be competing in track events. She was forced to withdraw, however, when injured during the U.S. track championships which were held in Newark, New Jersey as the country's Olympic trials. Mature career as a journalist Jackie Martin, photo of two farm women and their dog, taken in the mountains of east Tennessee in 1936 On leaving the Daily News in September 1930 Martin returned to the Herald as feature editor and photographer. She soon added picture editor to her responsibilities at the paper and, when owner William Randolph Hearst merged the offices of the Herald with those of the Times, she served in the same capacity for both papers. With this appointment Martin became the first woman to hold these management positions on a metropolitan newspaper. At that time she directed a staff of about a dozen men responsible for covering straight news, society, fashions, theaters, and sports in two or more pages of photos each day. Martin's mentor and boss was the paper's domineering and mercurial editor, Cissy Patterson. One author says that in the 1930s Martin was often credited with \\"almost single-handedly transforming William Randolph Hearst's tired Herald into what was to become Cissy Patterson's sleek, eye-catching Times-Herald.\\" In 1936 Martin and Patterson visited a rural section of Tennessee and North Carolina to produce a series of six articles called \\"Dixie's Dead End.\\" One of the articles described the hardships faced by two elderly farm women at the height of the depression. The image at left comes from this shoot. In August 1940 Martin left the Times- Herald to begin a career as freelance photographer, publicist, war correspondent, lecturer, and magazine editor. Between 1940 and 1944 she seems never to have been at rest. At the beginning of that period she spent two seasons crossing the country as a paid lecturer as well as managing an advertising campaign for the Chrysler Corporation. She next traveled by air across Brazil to shoot aerial and ground photos for two books profiling that country. In the winter months of 1941 and spring of 1942 she set up a photo department for the Washington bureau of the Chicago Sun-Times and began work as associate editor of the Woman's Home Companion. During the second half of 1942 she served as photographer and publicist for the first group of women to enter military service with the Army. In 1944 she obtained a contract from the Macmillan publishing company (of New York) for a book about nurses in the U.S. Army and was sent to Italy as war correspondent for Ladies' Home Journal. Given the opportunity to witness the invasion of southern France, she broke the Macmillan contract and accompanied the 7th Army in its liberation of Marseilles, Lyon, and Toulon. During the war years Martin contributed freelance photos and features to widely-circulated U.S. magazines, including Time, The Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and Look. She continued to produce freelance photojournalism after her return from Europe in 1945. For example, in May and June of that year she published articles in the Washington Star on the physical appearance of Army nurses (\\"Nurses Are Pretty,\\" May 27, 1945) and on the friendliness of servicemen towards the children they encountered behind the lines (\\"Soldiers and Kids,\\" June 3, 1945). The following year she served as feature editor and photographer in the Washington office of International News Photos and as photographer for King Features Syndicate, both owned by William Randolph Hearst for whom she had worked at the beginning of her career in journalism. She also resumed lecturing, this time under the auspices of the W. Colston Leigh Bureau. Throughout the 1940s Martin had done freelance work for Parade magazine and continued that work into the early 1950s. After 1952 Martin did little or no freelance work as she was by then stationed in Europe as a full-time employee of the United States Foreign Service. =Photographic technique= Jackie Martin, photo of Donald Nelson from Life, July 6, 1942 In 1925, when first learning her craft at the Underwood photo service, she used a 5x7 Graflex camera using glass plates rather than roll film as recording media. During much of her career as a photojournalist she used a variety of cameras including the Graflex 4x5 press camera with sheet film holders, a reflex camera with 120 roll film (probably Rolleiflex), and two 35mm compact cameras, Contax and Leica. The early 5x7 Graflex used flash powder for artificial lighting. The press Graflex and Rolleiflex used flash bulbs in detachable hand-grip units. The 35mm cameras could be used with flash units but were mainly used with available light. Martin was an early adopter of compact camera photography and, when it became available in the late 1940s, of high speed electronic flash lighting. The vast majority of Martin's photographs show people, not places or things. Like many other press photographers, she gave priority to realistic portrayal over aesthetic values in her work and her style was said to be unremarkable. She said her primary aim was to respect her subjects and accord them the best possible image. Shown at right is a typical photo from a magazine feature. She took it with a 35mm camera using available light for an article on Donald Nelson, head of the recently-established War Production Board. It appeared in the issue of Life for July 6, 1942, with the caption: \\"In Glencoe darkroom, Nelson displays a portrait of a friend developed himself. A mediocre photographer, he enjoys dabbling with chemicals more than taking pictures.\\" Jackie Martin, photo of an archivist in the National Archives, International News Photos, 1946 Shown at left is a 1946 photo that is more inventive and playful than her usual workmanlike news photos. She took it while working for the International News Photos service during preparation of a news feature on the archives. It shows a staff member wrapped in the transparent acetate foil that conservators used to laminate sheets of paper. Despite the gimmickry the photo shows techniques that Martin commonly employed. She shot the subject head-on, lit by flash held high on the left. She staged the scene to eliminate distracting details. The female subject was shown sympathetically, her pose and facial expression displaying cheerfulness and determination to be a good sport. The format was 5 x 7 and the camera probably a Press Graflex. Government photographer and publicist Before joining the foreign service in 1950 Martin had taken part in one official and one unofficial project for the U.S. government. In 1933 she served as unofficial press attaché to Ruth Bryan Owen during Owen's first months as ambassador to Denmark and Iceland. Between July and December 1942 she served in uniform as photographer and assistant public relations officer to the newly formed Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. In the late 1940s Martin had completed some projects for the Christian Science Monitor. Roscoe Drummond was then chief of the paper's Washington Bureau. In 1949 Drummond was appointed European Director of Information for the Economic Cooperation Administration. The following year he appointed Martin to be the ECA's chief of European Photographic Services. Based in Paris, she managed an office that provided photographs to promote implementation of the Marshall Plan across 18 countries. Her major achievement during the six years she served in that position was the organization of an international traveling exhibition of photographs called Family of Man that had been assembled by Edward Steichen and premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955. After returning from Paris in 1956 Martin spent ten years in freelance photojournalism while also working at her brother's motion picture studio. Her last major job was a 1967 government contract in which she documented military gravesites in Europe for the American Battle Monuments Commission. Books and manuscripts During the summer months of 1941 Martin traveled with an author known for her coverage of aviation news on a survey of Brazil by air. With cooperation from the Brazilian government they flew over the country in an outdated single-engine airplane. The trip resulted in many magazine feature articles and two books, both credited to Alice Rogers Hager as author: Frontier by Air (New York, Macmillan, 1942) and Giant to the South (New York, Macmillan, 1945). Martin's few months as WAAC photographer and publicist resulted in a book authored by Jean Stansbury called Bars on Her Shoulders (New York, Dodd, Mead & Co., 1943). While she was a war correspondent in southern Europe Martin assembled photos and prepared text for two books, The Nurses of World War II and Nurses in Action, but amid postwar disinterest in the immediate past was unable to find a publisher for either. Subsequently she again collaborated with Hager in a photographic portrait of Washington, D.C. called Washington, City of Destiny (New York, Macmillan, 1949). In reviewing this book, a critic for the Washington Post wrote: \\"Miss Martin focuses on the usual beauties of the city --its parks, fountains, formal gardens, sweeping vistas--with one notable exception. She deserves some kind of award for taking note of the seamier side of the Capital. There is one shot of a slum dwelling.\\" Clubwoman Martin was adept at making and keeping connections with others, whether they be friends, acquaintances, or business associates. Many of these connections were with women who, like herself, believed in the ability of affinity groups to assist the advance of women in professional and cultural affairs. As a first year student she joined the Delta Gamma sorority at Syracuse University and retained her membership through the rest of her life. In 1932 she was a founding member of the Washington Newspaper Women's Club and continued to be active in it for the rest of her career. Earlier she had joined the organization from which that club broke off, the Women's National Press Club. She regularly participated in the Press Club's satirical stunt nights and often drafted, composed, and performed in their skits. In 1936 she was elected to be an associate member to the Royal Photographic Society of England. Martin became the first female member of the White House News Photographers Association in 1942. Six years later she became an associate member of Theta Sigma Phi, a national professional and honorary fraternity for women in journalism. In 1955 she was elected second vice president of the Newspaper Women's Club. News accounts of the Washington social scene contain frequent mentions of her participation in club events and in June 1940 she gave an outdoor party for members of the two women's press clubs that featured hot dogs, steaks, a keg of beer, and, according to one account, \\"singing and much gay talk.\\" Executive of a motion picture company When Martin returned from Paris she was reported to be worn down and hoping to retire. At the insistence of her brother, Philip Martin, Jr., she nonetheless agreed to help run the Washington media company he directed. This was Norwood Studios, a motion picture production facility that specialized in government and commercial documentaries. In 1960 she became the company's vice president, and, according to one account, helped to make the firm the largest producer of documentary films south of New York. Signal achievements, honors, and awards In 1923 Martin became the first-ever woman sports editor at a major metropolitan daily paper when she took over that job at the Washington Times. In 1926 Martin was either the first or possibly one of the first women to manage and coach a professional basketball team. In 1937 she was the first woman to become art director and picture editor of a metropolitan paper. In 1941 she received George Arents distinguished alumni award from Syracuse University and was the first non-graduate to receive the honor. Later that year she was the first photographer given permission to take photographs by air in Brazil. The following year she was the first photographer and publicist for the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and first woman to wear a WAAC uniform. Later that year she achieved a long time goal in becoming the first woman member of the White House News Photographers Association. In 1944 Martin received the War Department's Certificate of Merit and the Theater Ribbon for war correspondence for her service as war correspondent in Italy and France. On two occasions in the late 1940s she received awards from the White House News Photographers Association. In 1961 she received the Order of the Southern Cross from Brazilian Government and two years later was given an award by her sorority, the Delta Gamma Rose Award. This, the organization's highest award, is given to members who are \\"renowned in their chosen fields\\" and whose accomplishments have received national or international recognition. Personal life and family Martin was born on April 1, 1903, in Braddock, Pennsylvania, to Philip Martin (1877-1954) and Emma Fredrica S. Herman Martin (1877-1962). Named after her paternal grandmother, Cecilia Barber Martin of Cornwall, England, her birth name was Cecilia Barber Martin. Philip Martin was a munitions expert who worked in Pittsburgh during Martin's childhood and who moved the family to Washington, D.C., during World War I in order to take a position as supervising engineer in the Old Soldiers' Home. Emma Martin was a Christian Scientist who was chaplain for the Columbia Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and sometime president of the Capitol Hill History Club. Martin had two sisters, Lydia (1900-1983) and Lillian (1908-2002), and a brother, Philip, Jr. (1916-1974). Lydia was a secretary before her marriage to a Soldiers' Home mortician, William P. Pugh. Lillian, like Martin, took a masculine nickname (Jerry) and was both an athlete and news reporter. In 1929 after working alongside Martin at the Washington Times and the Herald, she married a physician, William H. Clements, and subsequently managed his private practice in a suburb of Washington, D.C. Philip Martin, Jr., was a well-known motion picture producer of New York, Hollywood, and Washington, D.C. He owned and directed Norwood Studios, Inc., where Martin was vice president in the early 1960s. Martin lived in her parents' house at the Soldiers' Home until, at the age of 40, she bought a house in Georgetown. She left her papers and other archives to Syracuse University. A Syracuse archivist points out that although the collections are extensive and in other respects comprehensive, they contain little gossip about Martin's relations with other people and almost nothing about her private life. In 1932 her parents announced her engagement to a man named B. Wheeler Johnson, but there was apparently no marriage. One source notes rumors of a romantic relationship with Cissy Patterson. Another says of Patterson: \\"While she was editing the Times-Herald, she was carrying on a lesbian romance with the paper's picture editor.\\" The curator of a 1986 exhibit about Martin's years in Washington contains this statement about her public presence: > From her school days at Eastern High in Washington, D.C., to her time as a > war correspondent, articles about Jackie Martin appeared in the press. While > the setting might be the Delta Gamma sorority house near the Syracuse > University campus, the Lindberg baby trial, the Matta Grosso in Brazil, or > the Seventh Army's campaign through France, the story is the same. Plucky, > diminutive, dynamic, trustworthy--especially that; ladylike, fair, self- > made, hardworking photog, our girl returns from some assignment or is off to > one. We can reassuredly look forward to what Jackie--the press referred to > her by that somewhat androgynous nickname--has photographed. No surprises. > No rude awakenings to the world's threatening otherness. The curator adds that despite a decline in health that began during her wartime experiences, she continued to project youth and vigor even as she aged. Martin died following a long illness, at the age of 65, on December 15, 1969, and was buried in Washington's Rock Creek Cemetery. =Other names used= She adopted the nickname Jack while young and used it as an adolescent, expanding it to Jackie when in her mid-twenties. From the mid- twenties onward she was almost always referred to as Jackie Martin and only occasionally as Cecilia Martin or Cecilia B. Martin.

The two set out to visit another relative, Kapo, and while staying with him they began a heated argument. The argument developed into a fight, during which Te Wera killed Taoka's son. Taoka returned to his kaika and summoned a war party which laid siege to Huriawa for a year without success. Taoka then moved his party south to attack Te Wera's chief ally, Pakihaukea, at Mapoutahi. Pakihaukea's guard was relaxed and Taoka struck, climbing the palisades in the dead of night and massacring the 250 people found within.

Her father was a Protestant minister; her mother was a writer and editor, and an expert beekeeper. Her sisters included Mila Tupper Maynard (who also became a Unitarian minister) and educators Margaret Tupper True and Kate Tupper Galpin.

After her husband became a lawyer, the family moved to Colorado, where she organized a new church in Colorado Springs. In 1875 she attended the first Women's Ministerial Conference, hosted in Boston by Julia Ward Howe. In 1876 she was one of the founding leaders of Colorado College. In 1878, Wilkes moved again, to Sioux Falls in Dakota Territory. She organized seven Universalist congregations in the upper midwest, sometimes providing sermons and pastoral care in multiple states by riding a circuit from church to church. Once the churches were established, she handed them to another pastor, often another woman pastor from the Iowa Sisterhood. She was director of the Iowa Unitarian Conference. Wilkes relocated to California in the 1890s, serving as pastor of the Unitarian Church in Alameda, and assistant pastor in Oakland, California. She was a delegate to the Pacific Unitarian Conference, and was president of the Western Woman's Unitarian Conference. Late in life, she was chaplain of the Cumnock School of Expression in Los Angeles.  Suffrage  Wilkes was honorary vice president of the National Woman Suffrage Association, representing South Dakota, in 1884. She attended the World's Congress of Representative Women in Chicago in 1893. In 1896 she spoke at a Salvation Army camp meeting in Oakland, on the same platform as Susan B. Anthony. She split pulpit duties with Anna Howard Shaw and Eleanor Gordon at the 1905 national suffrage convention in Portland, Oregon. She shared the platform with both Anthony and Shaw at the second annual Women's Congress in San Francisco in 1895, and at a 1905 suffrage rally in Venice, California. She represented California at the International Woman Suffrage Conference in Budapest in 1913.

It aired on October 2, 2019, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by James Wong, and directed by Mary Wigmore. Plot The episode picks up immediately where the previous one left off, as serial killer Richard Ramirez corners Brooke, Chet, Rita, and Ray in the nurse's cabin. Ray abandons the group, only to be attacked and is rescued by Chet, while Brooke and Rita manage to escape to the parking lot; however, Rita knocks Brooke unconscious by drugging her and Rita is revealed to be a fraud. She is really Donna Chambers, a young psychologist obsessed with studying serial killers, such as Richter and Ramirez. In a flashback, Donna was able to persuade Dr. Hopple to let her study Richter, and is revealed to have assisted him in his escape from Red Meadows. Donna then abducted the real Rita, a nurse employed by Margaret, stealing her identity in order to observe Richter's potential murder spree at the camp. In the present, Montana, Xavier, and Trevor are attacked by a group of unseen assailants, revealed to be devotees of Richter. The real Richter proceeds to murder the devotees, while the counselors escape. Richter spares one of the devotees, nicknamed Wide Load, when he is able to sympathize with him. Ramirez pursues Ray and Chet through the forest, causing them to fall into a pit filled with spikes, leaving Chet seriously injured. A guilty Ray confesses to playing a role in the death of a fraternity pledge when he believes Chet is dead, having joined the others at Camp Redwood to escape conviction; Chet is revealed to have survived the fall, having heard Ray's confession. Montana, Xavier, and Trevor take refuge in a nearby shed, only to discover the real Rita. They free her and she attempts to escape, but is promptly murdered by Richter. Ray manages to climb out of the pit and abandons Chet to his own devices, before running into Montana, Xavier, and Trevor. Trevor gives Ray the keys to his motorcycle, sending him and Montana to call for help at a nearby phone booth. Xavier and Trevor discover Chet in the pit and pull him out, before accidentally killing Wide Load. Ramirez appears and ambushes Ray and Montana, and Ray abandons Montana. Ray is subsequently decapitated by Richter in his attempt to escape. Montana momentarily struggles with Ramirez, only for the pair to share a kiss. Montana wonders aloud to Ramirez why he has not killed \\"her\\" yet, leaving the episode on a cliffhanger. Reception \\"Slashdance\\" was watched by 1.34 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.6 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode has been critically acclaimed. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Slashdance\\" holds an 100% approval rating, based on 15 reviews with an average rating of 8/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"1984 delivers its best episode yet in a mind-blowing installment stuffed to the brim with endless reveals -- a fine return to AHS form.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"Mary Wigmore tends to play up the comedy in the episode, with a lot of the one-liners and asides given extra weight thanks to the actors' delivery and the way the scenes are set up, but she also displays some adept timing in the more horrifying moments.\\" He concluded by commenting, \\"The redshirts die swiftly. The betrayals are brutal. 1984 plays with the tropes and traditions of slasher movies and doesn't skimp on the staples of the genre, like flying decapitated heads and people being impaled on things. With the nimbleness of a dancer, American Horror Story is able to both satisfy the tropes and play with the tropes simultaneously. Slasher movies, for the right audience, are a lot of fun, and American Horror Story: 1984 is not short on the depraved sense of humor necessary to make a dumb 80's pastiche work. Watching fictional characters die is rarely so much fun.\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B rating. She enjoyed the characters' backstories as revealed in the episode, as well as the plot twists, and particularly liked the revelation about Rita, qualifying it as \\"a shades-of-Valerie-Solanas theory about serial killers being on the rise because of porn, misogyny, and the Vietnam war.\\" Rosenfield did not enjoy the introduction of the Mr. Jingles imitators, commenting that they were \\"pathetic.\\" She also criticized the development of Ray's character, to the point that \\"it is hard not to cheer just a little bit\\" when he is killed by Mr. Jingles. However, she concluded her review by praising the cliffhanger of the episode as \\"a big WTF moment.\\" Variety Andrea Reiher gave the episode a positive review, and concluded it with, \\"Can't wait to see what American Horror Story throws at us next week!\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes ","title":"Slashdance"},{"id":"61742681","text":"\\"Mr. Jingles\\" is the second episode of the ninth season of the anthology television series American Horror Story.

Plot Dr. Karen Hopple drives to Camp Redwood to meet with Margaret and explain Benjamin Richter's escape. Margaret does not seem surprised to hear about it, and insists the camp will re-open on schedule. Hopple suffers a blown tire on her return, and a tow truck intercepts her. Initially unaware that Richter is driving, she asks for a tire repair. He drags her out of her vehicle and stabs her in the neck before taking her ear as a souvenir. Brooke, still shaken from her phone call, hears on the news about a murder at a Red Meadows gas station. Believing it is the attendant they met before, Brooke freaks out, while the other counselors think she is overreacting. Margaret enters and reminds the counselors to go to sleep early, and not to fraternize between genders after dark. She makes a point of reminding the boys to clean away impure thoughts. Montana consoles Brooke, but says that she can not assume that everyone is out to get her. She describes an early experience when she was sent to fat camp and that she should not imagine the worst. Brooke later confesses that the previous summer, she was going to get married. Her groom Joey Cavanaugh of what she interpreted his jealousy as a sign of how much he loved her. At the altar he exclaimed that he saw his best friend, Sam, enter Brooke's home the night before and did not leave until the morning. They both insist nothing sexual happened, but Joey grabs a gun, killing Sam and Brooke's father, and then himself. Brooke insists that Sam was being kind and that they were simply friends, and is upset that no one ever believes her. Montana says that she believes her, and leans in to kiss Brooke. Brooke recoils and says that she needs air, walking away. Trevor describes to the boys his experience with Montana, as they walk towards the showers. Xavier leaves to get his towel and is grabbed and pulled into the back of a car, where his cousin and former agent Blake confronts him. Blake, who found him via his forwarding address, had previously coaxed Xavier into acting in gay porn in exchange for getting him off the streets and off drugs. Blake is now using the porn video to blackmail him into acting in more pornos. Xavier insisting that he’s not gay, offers to find a replacement and leads him to Trevor in the shower, who is talking with Ray and Chet. Xavier leaves while Blake observes via a peephole, only to be impaled through the head by Richter. Brooke sits on the pier and finds a dead body floating towards her feet, and turns screaming to find Richard Ramirez. She strikes him with an oar and runs. He is intercepted by the hiker, whom he disembowels. Later, the hiker returns alive, only to be killed again. Ramirez takes his name tag, which shows he was a counselor in 1970. Looking back up, the hiker has vanished. Brooke runs to the payphone but finds it cut. Montana finds her and questions what is going on, but Ray's screams interrupt them. They run to the men's showers, where the men have found Blake. Xavier is distraught, but denies knowing who Blake is. Trevor discovers that Blake's ear has been cut off and they are under siege by Richter. Margaret walks into her cabin to find Ramirez waiting for her and wanting an explanation for why Jonas (the hiker) will not stay dead. She puts on some music and treats his wounds. He explains that he has killed men before, but never the same person twice. Margaret credits God with the hiker's resurrection, and says he has been dead for many years. To explain, she asks him to tell her the worst thing that had ever happened to him. He describes a difficult childhood of abuse and physical trauma. His cousin treated his seizures and showed him pictures of women he had killed in Vietnam, and his wife objected, only to be murdered in response. Ramirez says that he likes Margaret, and she explains that he should not feel guilty for his actions if they are in service of God's (or Satan's) work. She tasks Richard with defending the camp and protecting the campers. Xavier tries to get the van started and the counselors attempt an escape, but they collide with Hopple's car before they can get away, distracted by a bloodied Rita in their path. She tells them that Richter is back and stabbed her, but she fortunately escaped. Both Rita and Trevor have vehicles that can take them individually, but neither has keys. They leave in two groups to retrieve them. Margaret identifies the amnesiac hiker as her old counselor Jonas, and she says he might be dead. He does not understand, but the last thing he remembers is running from blood. He says he left (the younger) her to die, and was hit by Richter in the truck when he ran; Jingles killed him thereafter. They determine that he is a ghost and would have stayed trapped if the counselors had not brought him back to camp. Rita, Chet, Brooke, and Ray approach the infirmary, and together they look for her keys in the desk to no avail; Richter observes them from outside. Trevor finds his keys, but he and Montana are stalled when Xavier tearfully reveals everything was his fault for bringing Blake and coming to Redwood. Both doors are pounded from the outside, someone wanting in.

[...] It's a series that has fun with the genre, but also takes the genre seriously. It's not poking fun, it's trying (and thus far succeeding) at being a slasher with a sense of humor. Part of that fun is watching a cast of good actors inhabiting stock characters with modern twists (Xavier is involved in gay porn and might be gay himself, Chet admits to using steroids, Ray is an orderly who appears to be afraid of dead bodies, the oversexed Montana is bisexual, the girl with the big chest is replaced by a guy with a huge penis, none of the black characters have died thus far, and so on). Also enjoyable is the fairly subtle use of references (I caught a snippet of incidental music from Friday the 13th this week).\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ rating. She started her review by stating she thought the episode was scary enough. She enjoyed the flashback of Brooke's wedding, commenting that while it is \\"...set to Billy Idol's \\"White Wedding\\"... between the puff sleeves and the bloodied satin, there are definitely shades of \\"November Rain\\" here, too.\\" However, she criticized the scene between Margaret and Dr. Hopper, thinking that Margaret's philosophy was out of context in this situation. Rosenfield later noted that the episode \\"pretty much made sense\\" until the supernatural elements, and concluded by commenting that she enjoyed the cliffhanger.

Specialist in quantum optics and cold atoms, Christophe Salomon is interested in the superfluidity of quantum gases and in the measurement of time using atomic clocks. A pioneer in this disciplinary field, he has helped to give France a world leadership position in the field.  Biography  From 1973 to 1976, he was a student at the École centrale des arts et manufactures in Paris. He then defended his postgraduate thesis in 1979. He joined the CNRS in 1980 as a research fellow at the Laser Physics Laboratory, University of Paris-Nord. In 1984, he completed a thesis in high-resolution laser spectroscopy and then embarked on a post-doctoral fellowship at JILA, University of Colorado (USA). Fascinated by the first work in the United States on the manipulation of objects and atoms by laser, Christophe Salomon was introduced to these new techniques at the University of Colorado, before joining the first research group in France on cold atoms, created by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji at the École normale supérieure (ENS). He is currently CNRS research director at the Kastler Brossel laboratory. \\"As a physicist and experimenter, I appreciate the privilege of being able to work in total freedom on exploratory subjects and the profound joy of discovery when the signals sought in a team, after several months of hard work, appear for the first time on a computer screen! » In 1985, he was a CNRS research fellow at the Kaslter Brossel laboratory, École normale supérieure de Paris. In 2000, he became research director at the CNRS, head of the \\"Cold Atoms\\" group with Jean Dalibard and, in 2008, head of the \\"Ultra-Cold Fermi Gas\\" group at the Kastler Brossel laboratory (ENS).  Scientific work  Cooled by light very close to absolute zero, atomic gases have very low thermal agitation, and can be used to measure time, space and gravitation with high accuracy. In collaboration with André Clairon, Christophe Salomon developed the first cesium clock operating as an atomic fountain. These ultra-precise clocks are now the foundation of international atomic time and advanced technologies such as GPS. Christophe Salomon has also been involved in the European space project ACES/PHARAO. This project aims to study the functioning of atomic clocks in space, in the absence of gravity, in order to carry out more precise tests of Einstein's general relativity. Below the microkelvin, atoms also reveal spectacular quantum behaviours, such as Bose-Einstein condensation or superfluidity, the transport of particles without friction. Christophe Salomon and his team were the first to observe the Bloch oscillations of ultra cold atoms and the solitons of matter waves. They also played a decisive role in understanding the relationship between the superfluidity of Cooper pairs for attractive interacting fermions and the Bose-Einstein condensation of these strongly related pairs. This work paved the way for quantitative N-body physics in the regime of strong correlations, a subject that is currently undergoing rapid development. He has written and co-authored nearly 150 scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals.  Honours and Awards  * 1988. Science and Defence Young Researcher Award * 1993.

History  The Boca Raton Historical Society was created as a project incorporated by the Junior Service League in 1972, which had sparked the interest of creating a local historical museum in the Old City Hall. After two years, the society first led the Boca Raton Preservation Board project created by the city which preserved the Boca Raton Old City Hall, the Cloister Inn, the Mizner Administration Building, and the Florida East Coast Railway Station from any future destruction as they were designated as historically important. Over the span of a decade, the community started several projects to restore historical areas, including Singing Pines (also known as the Children's Museum), the relocation of the Cabana Club, the Boca Raton Old City Hall, and the F.E.C. Railway Station. By 1975, the city council of Boca Raton declares the Old Town Hall as a designated site in plans to becoming a historical museum in the future. During 1983, the historical society began the restoration for the Old Town Hall, and by November 1984, the restoration was complete as it received a $500,000 plus total of donations from corporations towards the redevelopment.

After a year, the members of the society restored four rail way cars, including a 1930 locomotive and caboose, as well as two streamline rail cars from 1947.

He is the founder of the Sugunavardhini movement and a leader and propagandist of Brahmo Samaj in Kerala. He denounced idol worship and fought to end those social practices in Kerala that he thought were unethical. Among his followers were Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi, Vaghbatananda, and Brahmavadhi P. Kunhiraman. Gopalan titled P. Kunhiraman as \\"Brahmavadhi\\" and Sivayogi as \\"Brahmananda Swami\\". He was awarded and honored by the British government with the highest civilian award and title, the \\"Rao Sahib\\", for his services. The formation of the Sugunavardhini movement and Brahmosamaj played a significant role in the Kerala reformation movement. Biography Gopalan was born in Thalassery, Kerala, as the first son of Ayyathan Chandhan and Kallat Chiruthammal. His youngest sister, Ayyathan Janaki Ammal was the first female doctor in Kerala(Malabar) (First malayali Lady Doctor),which was an administrative district of Madras Presidency during British rule in India. He opposed superstitions and caste believes at an early age. Reluctant to observe caste differences or customs. He was against all caste evils and lived as a true \\"Brahmo\\" until his death. He did not act or oppose any other reform movements or any caste movements, but instead worked as a free man to revive society from all social evils. He never preserved the name of the caste in which he was born, nor spoke for their upliftment. Instead he criticized the superstitions and superstitious practices inside his own caste. Although he was from the Thiyya community, he never followed their customs and did not live as a Thiyya, thus being excommunicated from the thiyya caste at an early age. He studied at Anjarakkandy Elementary school, Brennen School, Mission High School and later joined Madras Medical College on 19 September 1884. He read about the Raja Ram Mohan Roy's Brahmo Samaj. ,Joined Brahmo Samaj and engaged in its social reform activities and became an active executive member of the General Committee of Calcutta Brahmo Samaj. He participated in the committee's annual conferences at various locations across India, along with Brahmo leaders such as Kesub Chandra Sen, Debendranath Tagore, Sivanath Sastri, Rabindranath Tagore, and R. G. Bhandarkar. In 1888, he obtained a medical degree with honors and entered into government service. He worked as a medic in several hospitals across South India and as a medical lecturer. Gopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal (Menon) on 30 December 1894. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kausallyaammal was a strong supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.  Social reform activities  = Establishment of Brahmosamaj branches in Kerala = Gopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and superintendent at several hospitals in South India,He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined the Calicut Lunatic asylum (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, caste and racial discrimination, malicious practices, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak. Gopalan extended his reform ideologies and propagated his reform activities by establishing the first branch of Brahmo Samaj on 17 January 1898 at Calicut. To conduct Samaj's meetings and prayers, a separate (lit. \\"hall\\")now Ayathan Gopalan Memorial Schoolwas opened to the public on 17 October 1900. The was inaugurated by Mana Vikraman Ettan Thampuran, the Zamorin King of Calicut. The second branch of Brahmo Samaj was established at Alappuzha in 1924.Later, Intercaste marriages were inspired in South Kerala. Under the leadership of Gopalan, social reforms were able to make great strides. Later on Brahmosamaj branches were also set up at Alathur, Telicherry, and at different parts of Kerala . = Sugunavardhini Movement = In the year 1900, Gopalan and Kausallyaammal initiated the Sugunavardhini Movement and extended his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children, attract children to his social activities, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalised sections of society, especially the Harijan (Dalit) communities in Kerala, that were poorly treated by the higher castes, He established the Chandhawarkar Elementary School with the intention to educate girls and the underprivileged sections of society. In addition to supporting and educating women and the underprivileged, their movement led reforms to oppose idolatry; promote and conduct (inter-caste marriages) and (inter- dining); spread women's education; maintain gender equality; eradicate untouchability, caste and racial discrimination; and conduct mass prayers and communion debates. Gopalan also participated in the Thali Road strike (Samaram at Calicut). = Impact of Sugunavardhini and Brahmosamaj at Malabar = The hymns for prayers sung at Brahmo Samaj were composed by Gopalan and are compiled in his book Keerthanaratnamala. He conducted several inter-caste marriages at Brahmo Samaj and worked to promote non-idol worship. \\"Brahmodharma\\", better known as the Brahmosamaj Bible, was written in Bengali by Maharshi Debendranath Tagore and was translated by him into Malayalam. He promoted his reformist ideologies by conducting dramas, public awareness campaign, and writings. The Sugunavardhini Movement and Brahmo Samaj were composed mostly of professionals and intellectuals, including Brahmananda Swamisivayogi, Vagbhatananda Guru, and Brahmavadi P. Kunhiraman, all with a more secular approach to reform. He raised his children, grandchildren, and all his followers as a good man, without raising them to live under a particular race, religion, or creed. It is for this reason that their name has been retained as \\"Brahmo\\" without a caste name. All of his children are intermarried (Intercaste marriage). All of them were married according to Brahmasamaj rituals. Even today, his children, grandchildren, family and followers remain casteless without caste names. On 4 June 1917, Gopalan was honored by the British Government with the highest civilian award and title, Rao Sahib,\\"British India: INDIAN TITLE BADGE (MYB # 327), RAO BAHADUR & RAO SAHIB MEDALS\\". worldofcoins.eu.

The monument rests upon the former village green, which has been located there since 1805. History and Description The granite monument is approximately 50 feet tall, resting upon a raised earthen berm. It sits on a 12-foot base. An allegorical figure of Victory (seven and a half feet tall ) sits atop a decorative column, plinth and base. Commemorative bronze plaques are on the east and west sides of the monument, with a cast bronze solder on the north side and a cast bronze sailor on the south side. The sailor and soldier are in period uniforms, standing at parade rest. The cornerstone was laid in the afternoon on Memorial Day late May 1890; the ceremony featured a speech by Colonel Albert D. Shaw given to \\"brother soldiers\\", local notables and the public who attended. The Watertown Herald prominently featured an engraving of the monument on their front page on June 6, 1891. The monument was dedicated on June 3, 1891 in the Public Square in Watertown. $10,000 was donated toward the monument by a Mr. and Mrs. George Cook. The night before it was unveiled, the monument was covered by a large US flag, measuring 36 feet long. It once flew from a flagpole in the square when each of the local regiments left for the Civil War. Originally costing $115, it was said to be the largest flag in the state at the time. Plaques on the monument read: \\"In grateful memory of the Soldiers and Sailors of Jefferson County who fought or fell in defense of the Union and the freedom of man. This monument to witness that these dead have not died in vain and that through them, under God, this nation had a new birth of freedom.\\" The monument underwent restorations and conservation between 2009 and 2012. It was cleaned, stabilized and repaired, which included adding the sailor's missing cutlass blade. The monument was found not to be leaning in any particular direction at that time.

Pieter Daniel Rossouw (Cape Town, October 17, 1845 – Fraserburg, October 11, 1896) was a pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) and an early writer in the Afrikaans language. The literary professor P.J. Nienaber called him \\"one of the first poets and writers in Afrikaans and an advocate for Afrikaans at a time when the Church was generally very hostile to the ‘kitchen language’.\\" Nienaber wrote that “at the time, it took courage for a minister to speak openly in favor of Afrikaans, and especially to write in Afrikaans. But the Rev. Rossouw went even further than a pastor in those days could in that he wrote the first sermons in Afrikaans in the controversial Die Afrikaanse Patriot, entitled Evangeli in di Volkstaal. L.B. Odendeel wrote in the Suid-Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek, vol. III, that Rossouw’s “most important contribution to the Afrikaans Language Movement lies in his clerical writing, though his poetry is undoubtedly significant.\\" John Christoffel Kannemeyer described him in Die Afrikaanse literatuur 1652–2004 as follows: \\"Pieter Daniel Rossouw (1845–1896) is best-remembered today for his satirical poem 'Stellaland,' a poem mocking John MacKenzie’s dissolution of the Boer republic of Stellaland (in what is now Botswana) to create British Bechuanaland through repetition of the three rhyming syllables in Mackenzie's name in each sentence.\\"  Background and childhood  Daniël Pieter Rossouw was young when his father died, and then his mother moved from Cape Town to Burgersdorp, where he worked in a store to support her in her old age. Enrolled at the local Albert Academy, he gained the attention of the headmaster, Dr. John Brebner, a popular figure among the local youth. Dr. Brebner sent the gifted youth to the South African College in Cape Town, where he struggled financially, and later to the NGK Kweekskool (theological seminary) in Stellenbosch. The Rev. Rossouw later told of how he rented a small room and studied by a whale oil lamp, working odd jobs over the holidays to fund his studies; though better off financially in Stellenbosch, he still lived sparingly. On March 12, 1869, he completed his theological studies and was ordained in the church, though it is not recorded where. That July, he began preaching in Uniondale and thus gaining fame.  In Uniondale  He married Sophia Agnes Johanna Human, daughter of Jurgen Johannes Human. One son, Pierre Daniel Roussow, served as a school inspector, while a grandson, Dr. Pierre Etienne Rousseau, ran the state enterprise in Sasolburg. The Rev. Roussow arrived in Uniondale on January 21, 1870, and was ordained the next day by the Rev. J.G.J. Horak of Mossel Bay. The Rev. Kuys would have received him but was ill, but the Rev. M.C. Botha of Knysna and the Rev. George Murray of Willowmore were in attendance, as was the Rev. Dower of the local Independent Mission Church. The Rev. Horak, then the consulent or acting pastor, chaired a special church council meeting the following Saturday evening to hand over his duties to its first official Reverend, and following the latter’s thanks adjourned until the next Monday morning at five o’clock. The meeting notes state \\"on Monday morning, the entire church council came together again.\\" The most pressing issue for the council was the matter of a parsonage. A committee on the matter decided to wait for the pastor’s arrival to consult with him, but a Mr. F. Taute of Molenrivier Farm donated a house and land for the purpose for £550. The council rejected the offer and decided to rent one for the time being, given the treasurer-deacon’s report of a £25 shortage beyond the £300 debt on the Lyon land purchase. The town of Uniondale had been founded in 1856, when the owners of each of the two parts of Rietvallei farm, Mr. James Stewart and Mr. A.L. du Preez, each founded their own villages, Hopedale and Lyon respectively. The neighbors disagreed until they wrote to the NGK George Ring (sub-synod) on September 24, 1865, stating their intention to unite the two villages as Uniondale and separate their own congregation from the George Reformed Church (NGK). The Ring agreed on October 19, and on January 20, the Uniondale Reformed Church was founded with the Rev. A.G.M. Kuys of George as consulent. To fund the parsonage, the council organized two sales and assigned £200 as salary for the pastor and around £50 a year for the reader-verger. When the controversial purchase of land in Lyon came to light, the Rev. Rossouw sought quick repayment. Since G.W.B. Wehmeyer was no longer a council member, deacon A.N. Smuts served in his place as deacon-treasurer, but in practice the pastor kept his own books. When Wehmeyer left, the Rev. Rossouw thanked him “for his many years of loyal service” and hoped that he would continue to assist the congregation. Three councilors, C.J. Fourie, H.J. Kritzinger, and J.H. Barnard, agreed to pay the debt, and the Rev. Rossouw (also the secretary) contracted with bondholders Barry & Neven to pay the debt and take over the churchyard. Inexperience with such transactions, the Rev. Rossouw contacted an old school friend, lawyer John Cairncross of Mossel Bay, to settle the case, which Wehmeyer saw as a motion of no confidence in his agency and past trust for business transactions. Harsh words for Wehmeyer at a future council meeting led to a sharp exchange of letters between him and the Reverend. He demanded the public calumnies be retracted and was given the chance to meet with the council, whence they appeared to resolve things. However, tensions continued over the litigation. Meanwhile, Cairncross continued to forward the council’s purchase payments on the plots and pass on the deeds of conveyance through his Cape Town contacts. Once all territory in Uniondale and the hamlet of Krakeel was secure, Cairncross was paid £125, including accrued interest on the purchase price. Despite all the expenses, the Rev. Rossouw reported a balance at the end of 1870. Considerable money was spent to repair a dilapidated church in Krakeel for the pastor to hold four services a year, up from two, other Sundays being handled there by the teacher and reader D.P. Terburgh since 1855. The Rev. Rossouw did not get along well with the people of Krakeel, and once the council even censured Terburgh and one of the Strydoms over their hostile behavior towards each other; ultimately, Terburgh left to work as a teacher and shopkeeper. The reader in Uniondale, J. van der Werff, resigned to teach for the Independent church in Dysselsdorp. The council’s search for a successor started with the verger, M.P. Mostert, followed by F.W. Schmidt doing triple duty as reader, verger, and teacher. Ultimately, the young P.C. Schoonees was hired for £50 per year as reader and verger in 1872 after helping his father (Mr. L.A. Schoonees) perform these duties in Mossel Bay. P.C. and his brother L.J. both married Terburgh sisters, thus connecting the two reader dynasties in marriage. = First parsonage in Uniondale = In 1872, the question of a parsonage re-emerged as the pastor’s family continued to rent the home of pledged co-donor Stewart. After the other donor from 1865, Du Preez, went bankrupt, the council gained a few of the plots. Joined at a meeting with the council by Wehmeyer and M.P. Zondagh (who had been there for the 1865 promise), Stewart paid £15 to release his remaining obligations. He agreed, however, to sell to the council another house, the current parsonage and former home of Anglican pastor the Rev. A.A. Dorrell, for £700. The Rev. Dorrell continued to use it for services while the Anglican church was under construction in town. Right after the parsonage’s purchase, the council began restoration. The floors were replaced with sturdy yellowwood lumber bought in Haarlem. In 1872, even the Krakeel sale raised £172, £66 more than the one in Uniondale, showing the commitment across the congregation to funding the efforts. The two bazaars raised £270 in 1875 despite the severe drought that year. By the time the Rev. Rossouw left, the parsonage was fully paid down as the congregation’s property. = A shocking fratricide = Although the local economy was growing, especially in the field of ostrich farming, the council remained concerned about morale. Council reports often expressed concern over bootlegging and other vices, and the 1874 one even reported a fratricide. A seventeen-year-old boy named Theunis J. Swart was scolded by his older brother, Hendrik, to watch the livestock that day, prompting the long-harried young man to shoot his brother in cold blood. Swart was tried in Oudtshoorn and sentenced to death, the whole affair causing great consternation in the quiet Uniondale community. = The Pace affair = Merchant Robert Pace was one of the first settlers of Lyon, and as a supporter of Wehmeyer, he contributed £10 to the pastor’s salary. In 1865, he was involved in a court case claiming other villagers had vandalized his fruit trees, heard by a judge in George who claimed that “Lyon where this happened must be a miserable place, and it is high time to put an end to such cases.” Sentencing the offender to six months in jail, the judge’s decision scandalized the George council already reeling from two prominent residents’ charges of drunkenness, leading to a dispute between Pace and Elder Dannhauser that the council resolved. At the end of 1876, Pace filed a more serious complaint against the Uniondale congregation. At the auction for the Lyon plots, the three Jewish brothers Gompert had purchased one, setting up a store there but later moving on to Kimberley upon which Pace bought them and took possession. The surveyor, Mr. Melvill, had made a serious error, marking the block T when the boundaries made it J. Pace wanted to correct the deed, but couldn't since Du Preez was in Transvaal. Since Wehmeyer had bought the “remaining extent of Lyon” for the church in 1867, however, block T-cum-J was technically church property and the council believed that Pace was squatting on it. The June 1876 notes show the council deciding to auction off the church land in September, though they claim the above block as church property despite the Gomperts building from the 1860s: “We must also find out who has damaged the foundation on block J6, the church’s property, and bring the perpetrator to justice by an agent of the congregation.” Aware of prior occupation and Pace’s objections, the council sold J6 to Deacon D.J. Swart. Pace pointed out that the corner beacons and boundary lines clearly showed the yard as the one he bought from the Gompert brothers, but the Rev. Rossouw lost his temper, ripped the map from Pace’s hands, and instructed auctioneer G. Haese to continue the sale. According to later court testimony, Wehmeyer also explained the illegality of the sale to a council member based on firsthand knowledge of land he bought in 1860, but no settlement was possible by this point. Dr. J.A. Heese wrote in the congregation’s centennial commemorative book: “September 23, 1876, was truly a fateful day in the Uniondale congregation’s history. To a large extent, Mr. Wehmeyer and the Rev. Rossouw’s magnificent building was razed to the ground by the court case.” That evening, the council discussed and approved the sale, while 23 congregation members led by Wehmeyer signed a petition calling for a general congregation meeting discussing the congregation’s financial practices, one the council called “beneath its dignity to acknowledge.” This turn of events led Pace, with Wehmeyer’s support, to file suit with the magistrate to block the sale, resulting in a December court order suspending it pending the council’s justification of its claims. The council decided to contest the claims at December 9 and 23 special meetings, and on March 31, 1877, they agreed to assign the Rev. Rossouw power of attorney to represent them. He was going to Wellington anyway to assist the Rev. Andrew Murray, and thus would be near Cape Town to monitor the trial. In The June 5, 1877, issue of Volksblad, reported the June 1 verdict, decided earlier but officially announced once chief witnesses could come there after being held back by a storm at Mossel Bay. One of the main council-appointed witnesses turned back in the face of a second storm for Uniondale, leaving only Haese and Cairncross, who came after 1860 and did not have first-hand knowledge of the sale. Pace’s witnesses, Wehmeyer and Mostert, were old residents of Lyon. The council’s lawyers, Buchanan & Jones, realized the council’s case was lost, and the Rev. Rossouw did not testify himself. The judge’s damning verdict called the council’s behavior “shameful,” required them to pay all £500 in court costs, almost all of which was paid by the Rev. Rossouw’s father-in-law, J. J. Human, the rest with the congregation coffers. The Rev. Rossouw and congregation members repaid Human nearly £150, then sent for more “voluntary” donations, raising £350 to repay the bulk of the debt by the time the Rev. Rossouw left. = Resignation from Uniondale = Dr. Heese counters the accusation that the Rev. Rossouw plunged the congregation into debt and then abandoned it as follows: “This is not true. While his impulsive behavior made him unpopular with some congregation members, especially in light of the court verdict, he already had an offer from the Maraisburg Reformed Church but only accepted the one for the nearby Steynsburg Reformed Church (NGK) in 1878. His decision was understandably received with mixed feelings.” Newspaper articles and reports from the time show part of the congregation happy with his exit, but others especially in the council quite attached and sorry to lose their “beloved pastor.” One correspondent states that Krakeel should have been the capital and that the pastor-preferring residents of that area, the Langkloof valley, had grounds for their own congregation. The Rev. Rossouw’s popularity was admitted by his successor, the Rev. W.A. Joubert.  In Franschhoek  Franschhoek's NGK church was built in 1847, expanded in 1883, and partially restored in 1967–1968. The Rev. Rossouw was the local pastor from September 8, 1881 to February 2, 1883, when he left for Fraserburg The Franschhoek NGK congregation waited six months from exit of the Rev. Jacobus George Joubert Krige (1873–1881) until the Rev. Rossouw’s arrival. On September 6, 1881, many members came several miles out of town to welcome him to town. The investiture ceremony on the 9th in a full church was attended by the Revs. J.H. Neethling (the consulent), Krige, Edmund de Beer, Murray, J. Stegmann, and Prof. J. Marais. The Rev. Neethling’s investiture sermon was based on fishing as discussed in Luke 5, while the Rev. Rossouw’s inaugural sermon was on Exodus 3:14: “God said to Moses, ‘I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: [I AM has sent me to you].’” At that time, the journey from Steynsburg to Franschhoek could only be made by sea, so the Rev. Rossouw traveled to Port Elizabeth by wagon and from there on the Nubian to Cape Town at a cost of £70, of which only £25 was compensated by the Rev. Rossouw from his less than four years in Steynsburg. Franschhoek, meanwhile, lost the government subsidy for the pastor grandfathered in with the Rev. Krige upon his exit, but was still in good shape for services and considering the church building enlargement the latter had explored. On October 3, 1881, the council approved a congregation meeting for the 20th which founded the construction committee, whose November 15 report to the council meeting showed differences of opinion over how to proceed. The results of the November 21 congregation meeting are unclear, but in the end it was agreed to add two wings and begin construction. An agreement was made with the city to keep the parsonage water tank at ¾ of an inch and supply the full stream to the parsonage for six hours two days a week, with G.J. Kriel appointed to negotiate on the council’s behalf. Jacob Hugo disputed the water with the church council, leading to the municipality getting the water on condition that the parsonage would receive a sufficient share. The church decided at its October 2, 1882, meeting to build a well, and if successful a pump, rather than waiting for a pipe to be laid. The 1882 Ring report concluded that despite the bustling trade, smallpox in Cape Town, and generally hard times,” perhaps worse in Franschhoek than elsewhere, collections equaled the previous year and were much more than for the two before it. The thanksgiving feast built the sustenance fund up to £758 6 s. 8 d. During the Rev. Rossouw’s tenure, late services shifted from the afternoon to the evening, and young people began attending more. At the end of 1882, he took a post in Fraserburg, handing in his resignation on January 28, 1883, from the Steynsburg congregation. Fraserburg thus reimbursed the Rev. Rossouw’s travel costs to Franschhoek, since once again the Rev. Rossouw hadn't reached his four-year threshold.  In Fraserburg  After the Rev. Carl Arnoldus Bamberger resigned from the Fraserburg Reformed Church, the council first interviewed the Rev. Adriaan Moorrees of the Richmond Reformed Church on September 25, 1882. He declined, and so the Rev. Rossouw was hired that November 1 and welcomed to the congregation for investiture on February 5, 1883. D.A. Kotzé writes: > If his predecessor laid the temporal foundations for his flock, he laid the > spiritual ones. His successor states that he “sowed and plowed well.” > Perhaps it was a matter of circumstance, since constant droughts plagued the > indifferent, thus requiring spiritual development to compensate their > temporal poverty. = Persistent droughts = Remembered by one of the oldest congregation members in the 1951 centennial of the congregation as “a great soul-winner, school and missionary man,” the Rev. Rossouw emphasized missionary and education work during his tenure. A year after his arrival, the council could report to the Ring that “since his confirmation, the Church Council has had the pleasure of being able to work in complete harmony with him in promoting the eternal and temporal needs of the Congregation.” Without his aptitude, Kotzé writes, “unimaginable and unprecedented disasters would have occurred, given the almost indescribable droughts that relentlessly plagued the region. In 1884, the drought peaked to the point where home visits were impossible, but the pastor regularly visited satellite churches and kept in contact with the congregation. Maintaining schools seemed next to impossible for the council, but separate Sunday school for white and Cape Coloured children continued. Attendance rose despite farmers needing to travel far and wide to pasture their livestock. A Ring report from the time stated that “more than one told of never feeling as abandoned by God as now.” The drought reached a point in 1885 where “entire households would have perished had He not opened the hearts of other countrymen. But money and supplies have come in generously for which we praise the Lord. We will owe them our gratitude for as long as we live.” A relief committee was organized and met three times a week to issue provisions, though “it was exhausted quickly, and there was no end to the need. Needless to say, many were impoverished. Parishioners with large households who recently were affluent lost everything and now survive on bread and depend on others to house them. How long the misery will continue, the Lord only knows, but the danger is not over and the need is growing.” The congregation was largely depopulated as it scarcely rained for two years, driving farmers to seek their livelihoods in the Prieska, Hopetown, Richmond, Britstown, and Murraysburg, even to the Sneeuberge and Middelburg, Eastern Cape. Prayer hours increased from the one hour that had prevailed for 20 years to four. Recovery began in February 1887, spurred on further by a mission conference held at the beginning of June attended by the vast majority of the congregation who substantially subsidized the Domestic Mission Debt. Improvements were only temporary however, according to the 1888 Ring Report, and in 1889, the drought returned after a grueling seven years. The report stated that “our people have had to spend hundreds, never mind, thousands, of pounds sterling to rent fields and buy water elsewhere. Thousands of sheep died in the last fifteen months alone, such that one farmer went from 2,000 to 1,000 of them last year to this year and another went from 3,000 to under 400.” Judging by the church minutes, however, the pastor and congregation felt spiritually confident: “our God not only dwelled in the Burning bush and kept it holy, but by his Almighty Power enabled it to grow amidst the flames and bear the most glorious fruit.” Hence, they contributed £14 to the Bechuanaland congregation, £5 for the Domestic Mission, £15 for the Mission, £14 10s. for the Kweekskool, and another £20 7s. despite public skepticism toward other miscellaneous mission ends. Even thanksgiving offerings were beyond expectations, delivering £450, 500 sheep, and two horses. On September 1, the day thanksgiving month began, the drought peaked and those remaining began to consider leaving, but rain fell on the night of the 5th and contributions brought the congregation’s debt down from £1,183 to £840 by October 1 with no interest in arrears. The council had 650 sheep, two horses, and two bales of wool as collateral. The Sunday schools made progress, the domestic and outside missions carried on, and both men’s and women’s prayers were well-attended. Unfortunately, 1889 saw continued struggle. Dams stayed dry, fountains were weakened, fields scorched by writhing winds, and seedlings yielding nothing but dust. “In many places, the stench of dead sheep arose around the kraals while people dreaded the worst. Hardly a sign of rain came from the sky, and when the west wind blew cold, the situation worsened. That December, however, torrential rains fell, “finally relieving the drought and restoring our confidence, changing the face of our congregation dramatically.” Many twin lambs were born in 1890, and the parish debt was fully paid off from its £1,000 1889 level by the end of 1890. From 1891, the congregation was solvent, and the Rev. Rossouw miraculously healed from a serious, four-year illness. = Trellis work on the second church = In 1890, the council grew to four members, two elders and two deacons. A congregation meeting was also held to decide on whether to build a trellis railing around the church, at which the consensus settled on a £1,000 budget. On January 12, 1891, the Rev. Rossouw reported to the council on his pricing consultations with businessmen Mr. De Waal and Mr. De Kock at the previous Synod meeting; they contacted a Scottish firm that had sold such fencing to a Table Bay congregation for £600 including £120 for shipping. Frans Maritz brought it from the nearest train station at 2/6 per 100 pounds minus £5 subsidy to the cause, and the council prepared for a celebration. Prof. Nicolaas Hofmeyr at the Kweekskool was invited to be master of ceremonies, since he proposed the idea to beautify and seclude the building, but he could not come to Fraserburg for the September 3 inauguration, sending his regards a month alter. The final cost was £1,320.  The Rev. Rossouw’s illness and death  On December 3, 1892, the Rev. Rossouw asked for leave after an exhausting decade. Kotzé wrote as follows: “the respective debt and poverty of the church and members, to say nothing of the illness of his valued and indispensable helpmate, his wife, weighed heavily on his robes. It was too much for flesh and blood, for the Rev. Rossouw turned to the masses his tender heart, feeling and suffering with them. Now he ached physically as though taking the blows his congregation withstood.” The Rev. Rossouw planned to go to the Boland to rest “on the beach” and recover his strength, and on January 23, 1893 turned in to the council a letter and two doctors’ certificates attesting to his health issues. The council expressed in reply their “heartfelt regret for the visiting hand of God resting on our beloved Pastor” and gave him six months’ leave, which allowed him to recuperate enough to serve another four years. However, by October 1896, his still questionable health had deteriorated once more. On October 11, 1896, the Rev. Rossouw, 14 years the pastor of the Fraserburg congregation, died. De Zuid-Afrikaan eulogized him as follows on the 15th: “he was an Evangelist overflowing with deep earnestness, holy fire, and an inexhaustible industriousness. He was not only a pastor, but also a close friend in the best sense of the word of the poor and the afflicted.” The Rev. De Beer said in De Vereeniging: “he was a pastor of unusual anointing.” Classmates from Cape Town considered his success at the pulpit a surprise given his youthful stutter. P.J. and G.S. Nienaber wrote in Geskiedenis van Afrikaans letterkunde: “the Rev. Rossouw was also gifted with a fine sense of humor. The Rev. De Beer told of a Synod meeting at which he sniffled through a heavy cold and the Rev. Rossouw said to him: “Brother, you don’t need to blow your own trumpet that much.” On October 26, 1896, the council recorded “how deeply they felt the great loss that the Church in general, and that church in particular, have suffered as a result of his early death. That the Church Council values his faithful work in the church and thanks God for what He has given to the Church and the congregation through the Reverend.” The Rev. Rossouw was buried in the church cemetery at a well-attended ceremony, and the congregation raised a gravestone in his honor. The town council also named the street through the Fraserburg central business district of the time Rossouw Street in his honor.  Literary contributions  Dr. Heese wrote in the 1966 Uniondale Reformed Church centennial book: “the Rev. Rossouw earned a place of honor among the [Afrikaans] language’s pioneers.” On October 4, 1878, he published his brief in Die Afrikaanse Patriot advocating for sermons in Afrikaans, and just three months later, on January 10, 1879, one of his own became the first exemplar in print in the very same publication. His Afrikaans sermons were collected in book form as Godsdienstige stukke (Afrikaans for “religious excerpts”) in 1881. The Rev. Rossouw wrote in the September 28, 1884 Patriot as to why he wrote in the language: > We write in this Afrikaans language because we know it truly is a language > and that the arguments of its proponents have never and can never be > refuted. Another reason is that one can express oneself far more powerfully > in Afrikaans than in Dutch, and there is expressiveness, directness, a je- > ne-sais-quoi which is not found in many languages. Also, most of our > population understands it better than anything else, and therefore the great > unwashed among our compatriots can hear of their salvation in a language > they speak and hear every day. P.J. and G.S. Nienaber wrote in Geskiedenis van Afrikaanse letterkunde: “the Rev. Rossouw spoke to his readers from heart to heart and never hesitated to present to them the awfulness of hell besides the atonement of Christ.” They continue with the following examples: > Oh, how terrible it will be, if there is a father or mother among the > readers of the Patriot who suffers an immoral life that leads them to the > sin which dare not speak its name! Parents who drink!...We sure you whether > you are young or old, that there is a hell, an eternal damnation, a terrible > place of torment, for those who do not take salvation from the hand of the > Lord Jesus. So let yourself listen, and fall not to damnation. On December 12, 1879, the Rev. Rossouw’s sermon answered the question, “What is sin?” and ended his sermon asking the sinner: “Have you never trembled at the sight of your sin, or trembled at the thought of hell and eternal damnation? Then tremble today, shudder today!!” His preaching was very popular, and he received letters of appreciation and testimonies from repentant readers. The sermons in the Patriot, the Nienabers wrote, reached those who never darkened a church door, read a bible, or visited a pastor, but were ended on October 31, 1884. His influence on the language’s promotion was great, spiritually and otherwise. He worked with the Rev. Stephanus Jacobus du Toit and other pastors on the Bijbelsch Dagboek (Afrikaans for “biblical diary”), designed that so that a family could read through the New Testament over the course of a year. An appropriate statement and Psalm verse was included near various scripture passages. Shortly before the Rev. Rossouw’s death, he collaborated with the Rev. Murray on a Dutch translation of the Book of Martyrs by John Foxe, detailing tortures endured by Christians from Jesus himself through the Protestant pioneers, deemed “particularly fascinating” by Prof. Nienaber. According to the Rev. Rossouw’s grandson Leon Rousseau, the translation worsened Dutch and Afrikaner attitudes toward the Catholic Church. The Rev. Rossouw wrote poems during his Fraserburg tenure, including ones in Afrikaans, Dutch, and English. Some of his Dutch poems were published in De Zuid-Afrikaan under the pseudonym “P.D.R. van Uiendal.” English poems, including one on the Battle of Majuba Hill, were published in the South African News. Under the pseudonym Cefas, he wrote the famed Afrikaans-language poem “John MacKensie moenie grens nie” (“John MacKenzie, no borders!”), published in Die Afrikaanse Patriot on August 29, 1884. The latter poem that made him famous related to an incident in 1882 where the Republics of Stellaland and Goshen, founded by Boer settlers on land seized with the help of Tswana chiefs Moshette and Massouw from their British-backed rivals Montsioa and Mankoroane. The proxy battle was settled by the London Convention (1884) that divided the land between Britain and Transvaal, with the Rev. MacKenzie appointed commissioner under direct British rule. The Rev. MacKenzie was a better missionary than statesman, and was particularly criticized for his natives policy, ultimately being recalled by High Commissioner of South Africa Sir Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead. Prof. Nienaber considered the satire “at home with the work of the best Dutch and English poets.” > Stellaland Aan die adres van John Mackenzie John Mackensie, moenie grens > nie! Ja, jou tyd was kort; jy het nie kan toon nie wat daar in jou woon nie; > sonder seremonie moes jy somaar vort! John Mackensie, moenie grens nie!

Leon Rousseau writes about his grandfather  Leon Rousseau (March 5, 1931 – February 24, 2016), the writer and publisher in Afrikaans and founder of the publisher Human & Rousseau, recounted in 2013 in the Kerkbode how he found his grandfather’s Bible unopened after 60 years. Leon inherited it from his father Pierre, born on February 22, 1882 and thus 14 at the Rev. Rossouw’s death, dying in turn at November 22, 1954. Rousseau does not record how many children the Rev. Rossouw had (other sources report eight), but his children did change the family name to Rousseau. “Grandfather was often busy with the Bible or with a sermon in his study, and Grandmother with her numerous plants,\\" Leon relayed from Pierre, who enlisted in Pieter Hendrik Kritzinger’s commandos in 1901 and was seriously wounded and sentenced to death for his role in the Cape Rebellion. He was pardoned, however, and several years after the end of the Second Boer War, he married Leon’s mother, the 20-year-old Elise Gardner. Elisabeth Luise Rousseau was the sister of Prof. G.B.A. Gerdener and aunt of the colorful politician Theo Gerdener. Pierre later served as a school principal in Worcester. The Rossouws had eight children: * Sophia Agnes Johanna Rousseau (married Knobel), February 23, 1870 –November 7, 1916 * Gideon Jacobus Rousseau, February 5, 1875 – October 30, 1918 * Johannes Zacharias Human Rousseau, born June 15, 1878 * Catharina Maryna Elizabeth Rousseau (married Van der Merwe), October 16, 1879 – June 27, 1964 * Pierre Daniël Rousseau, February 22, 1882 – November 20, 1954 * Andrew Murray Rousseau, July 21, 1884 – November 20, 1941 * Maria Luise Rousseau (married Michau), born March 1, 1890 – 1915 * Johan Heinrich Bruchhauser Rousseau, March 25, 1894 – October 10, 1900  Sources  Heese, Dr. J.A.

The weapon system is remotely similar to the British Hedgehog anti submarine rocket launcher from the Second World War. Description Kurki (51). The system is very light and was developed in 1955 especially for smaller vessels. It can not be swiveled horizontally, it is targeted with the entire ship, which is a serious disadvantage of the weapon system. The RBU-1200 has five launcher pipes in one system. Reloading is done manually. The system is controlled by a PUS-B \\"Uragan\\" fire control system. The system is designed to destroy submarines and torpedoes. Ammunition RGB-12 uses contact fuzes. The launch is made of solid rocket fuel, the flight itself is ballistic arc with a long range from 400 to 1200 meters. The contact lighter K-3, K-3M, or combined contact-remote lighter KDV is used as a lighter.

Location The Godbout River is in Godbout, Manicouagan Regional County Municipality. It is long. The river forms in Lac de la Traverse, which in turn is fed by the small Rivière Hall, which forms just south of Lake Sainte-Anne. It flows in a generally southeast direction to enter the Saint Lawrence just south of the village of Godbout. Its main tributary, the Rivière Godbout Est, flows south from the southeast bay of Lake Sainte-Anne, which is dammed, to join the south part of the Godbout River. Name The indigenous Montagnais called the river Oiaouirabougou, or Oiauirabugu, meaning \\"whirlpool\\". The name Godbout or Godebout is found in documents from the 17th century. There are two theories about the origin of the name. One is that it was named after François Godbout, caption of a Hudson's Bay Company schooner. It is more likely that the village of Godbout was named after Nicolas Godeboust (1634−1674), a navigator and pilot who was mentioned in the 1666 census, and the river was named after the village. A 1670 text by Père Albanel mentions the rivière Godebout, and a 1684 map by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin shows the place named Godebou. The name was made official on 5 December 1968. Environment A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the Rivière Godbout Est rising and flowing south through the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. The Rivière Godbout proper flows through the fir/white birch domain of the boreal zone. It has a large watershed and many small tributaries. It flows through the mountains below rocky escarpments, and has many section of rapids and seven waterfalls. The surroundings are boreal forests mainly populated by conifers. Fishing river Napoléon-Alexandre Comeau (1848–1923) was a hunter, fishery warden, government official, naturalist, and author. His father was a Hudson’s Bay Company agent, and he grew up in trading posts in the Îlets-Jérémie, Mingan, and Sept-Îles. In the 1860s he became fishery warden on the Godbout River, a position he held for over 60 years. The river at that time was a popular salmon fishing destination for businessmen and politicians from Canada and the United States. Comeau used his experience of fishing and hunting in the Côte-Nord to become an accomplished naturalist, author of articles in National Geographic and Forest and Stream, and involved in many aspects of management of the environment. The river is still known as one of the best of Quebec's salmon rivers and also holds speckled trout. The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of the Gobout watershed are mainly large salmon that come to the estuary in early June. The salmon cannot cross the falls when the flow is high, above , so linger in the holes of the downstream section until early August. About of the river is managed by a zone d'exploitation contrôlée (managed use zone), the Zec des Rivières-Godbout-et-Mistassini.

She was an accomplished scholar and a public servant.  Childhood  Mary Jean Simpson, the daughter of George SimpsonInterview with Miss Mary Jean Simpson, November 26, 1976, by Helen Merrick, was born in East Craftsbury, Vermont on July 18, 1888. She was brought up in the East Craftsbury Prebyterian Church.Sally Waters Fishe, Vermont Historical Society Simpson graduated from St. Johnsbury Academy in 1908. After she graduated she went to Wheaton Seminary because she did not have enough credits to go to her top choice, Mt. Holyoke. When she got to Wheaton Seminary there was a scarlet fever epidemic where she was quarantined. Once she got out of quarantine she was asked to take over grades 5-9 at the Village School for the Spring Term. She took the job even though she had never taught before. Simpson said she had never felt so rich because she got paid $7.00 a week for teaching at the Village School. Later on she went back to St. Johnsbury Academy to get the credits for Mt. Holyoke. During this time, her father got sick, so she went to the University of Vermont instead of Mt. Holyoke to be closer to home. She majored in Latin and graduated in 1913 as a Phi Beta Kappa. After graduating Simpson got multiple jobs teaching. She started at Peoples Academy for three years, then for two years she went to Montpelier High School, and then during World War I she went back as the principle to Peoples Academy.  Career  = Work in the United States Senate = In 1924, Mary Jean Simpson was elected for Town Representative. She was the first woman to be elected from Orleans County. In 1925, she was appointed by Senator Dale to be bill clerk of the United States Senate in Washington. She served under Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. While she worked there she had a big roll-top desk that overlooked the Capital. She kept a record of each bill in a big record book. In this ledger, she recorded the course of each bill up to the bill's signature or veto by the president. In 1933, during the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt became president, and Simpson lost her position. However, during the Depression she was appointed to the Women’s Division of the Civil Works Administration and later traveled through the United States as Director of Women’s Production Projects for the Works Progress Administration. = Dean of Women at University of Vermont = Mary Jean Simpson became the Dean of Women at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 1937. While there, she recruited students for the school's first nursing program and established a scholarship program for returning veterans. Simpson wrote letters to the parents of the daughters who were entering the university. These letters showed the high standards she had set for women students at UVM. The letters said women \\"should not let her work pile up, nor sacrifice regular study hours to pleasant social demands, nor give more time than she can afford to ‘dates,’ sports, or other extra- curricular activities.\\" Thirteen years after becoming the Dean of Women at the University of Vermont, a women’s dormitory was named Simpson Hall in her honor. She retired as Dean of Women in 1954. The university presents the Mary Jean Simpson Award to a female student every year at graduation. The award goes to a woman who best exemplifies Mary Jean Simpsons character, leadership and scholarship.  Retirement  When Simpson retired in 1954, she got involved in new responsibilities including the Vermont Board of Managers of the National Council of Church Women, the Vermont Council on Adult Education, Secretary of the Board of Trustees of Vermont Colleges, Chairman of the State Commission on Alcohol Education, Steering Committee Chairman of the Vermont legislative Council and the Citizens Advisory Committee to National Prohibition and Parole Survey. She also worked to promote the Japan International Christian University.  Death  Mary Jean Simpson passed away in 1977 at the age of 89 in East Craftsbury, Vermont.

There are conflicting accounts of what caused the stampede, one claimed that a walkway collapsed, leading the crowd to panic. Another account stated that one person tripped and fell among the runners and others fell over him. Background Ashura is an important holiday in the Islamic calendar, marking the death of Husayn ibn Ali (Imam Hussein), a grandson of prophet Muhammad. He was killed in 680 AD in the Battle of Karbala which became a central event to Shia Islam. Since then, the first ten days of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, are a national holiday in Shia Islamic countries, with the tenth day culminating in Ashura. The Ashura day of mourning in Karbala was the target of a terrorist attack in 2004, when simultaneous bombings in Karbala and Najaf killed 134 people. A 2005 stampede had occurred in Baghdad during a similar event, caused by word that the event might be subject to a terrorist bombing. More recently, several attacks on Ashura processions have been perpetrated by Sunni extremists. Stampede Thousands of pilgrims at the Imam Husayn Shrine in 2005 One of the common events during the celebration of Ashura in Karbala is the Tuwairij run, where pilgrims run through the streets about to the Imam Husayn Shrine in honour of the run that maternal cousins of Husayn's half- brother Abbas did from the village of Tuwairij (today known as Al-Hindiya) to Karbala in order to aid Husayn in the Battle of Karbala. The event around noon on 10 September 2019 drew hundreds of thousands of pilgrims planning to make the run. Reports varied as to what caused the stampede; one claimed that a walkway collapsed, leading the crowd to panic. Another account stated that one person tripped and fell among the runners and others fell over him, cascading into the stampede. Authorities came in to calm the crowds and assess the damage. At least 31 people were killed in the chaos, with at least 100 injured and sent to local hospitals. At least 10 of those injured were in critical condition. Reactions Authorities are investigating the cause of the event. Iraqi president Barham Salih and prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi offered their condolences for the loss, as well as the United States Ambassador to Iraq, Matthew H. Tueller. The Iraqi Foreign Office released a statement saying that there was no Pakistani among the dead.

It is backed and promoted by Michael Moore, who served as the executive producer. Moore released it on YouTube for free viewing on April 21, 2020, the eve of the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day. The film examines the decision of mainstream environmental groups and leaders to partner with billionaires, corporations, and wealthy family foundations in the fight to save a planet in crisis. A conclusion of the film is that green energy cannot solve the problem of society's expanding resource depletion without reducing consumption and population growth, as all existing forms of energy generation require consumption of finite resources. The film also questions whether renewable energy sources such as biomass energy, wind power, and solar energy, are as renewable as they are portrayed to be. Upon its release, Planet of the Humans generated intense controversy, was criticized for being outdated and misleading. There were calls to take down the film including by several beneficiaries of the foundations critiqued in the film. The film was temporarily taken down from YouTube on 25 May 2020 in response to a claim of copyright infringement, which PEN America condemned as \\"censorship plain and simple.\\" The filmmaker's challenged the claim, arguing that the fragment was used under fair use and that free speech was subverted. Twelve days later, YouTube removed the restriction, allowing the film to be viewed again.  Synopsis  Planet of the Humans takes a critical look at the mainstream environmental movement, questioning its leaders' decision to partner with billionaires, corporations, and wealthy family foundations, and to promote renewable energy technology as the solution to climate change. Gibbs admits to being a long-time fan of renewable energy. When Barack Obama directs billions of dollars into renewable energy, Gibbs follows the green energy movement more closely but is disappointed with his initial findings. “Everywhere I encountered green energy,” Gibbs says, “it wasn’t what it seemed.” Attending General Motors' Chevy Volt press conference, he learns that the vehicle is being charged by a fossil fuel grid. A visit to his local solar array reveals it could only meet the energy demand of 10 homes over a year. He joins a group of concerned citizens on a hike to a wind turbine construction site in Vermont and finds part of the mountainside being removed. Gibbs asks, “Can machines made by industrial civilization save us from industrialization?” This question leads Gibbs to environmental sociologist Richard York’s study published in the journal Nature, which found renewables were not displacing fossil fuels. Gibbs also speaks with author Richard Heinberg and anthropologist Nina Jablonski on why people seek technological fixes. Gibbs then interviews Ozzie Zehner, author of Green Illusions, who reports that solar, wind, and electric vehicle technologies require mined minerals, including rare earths, and heavy industrial processes to produce – with new mines opening as demand for green technology rises. Gibbs and Zehner travel to Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the Mojave Desert and show a natural gas line hooked up to the facility. Gibbs speaks to a series of solar industry insiders, an electrical engineer, and a Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner about solar energy’s intermittency limitation and reliance on baseload plants. Zehner reveals that while the Sierra Club’s ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign has been successfully closing coal plants, natural gas plants were opening in their wake resulting in the overall expansion of fossil fuel use in the United States during that same time period, citing data from the U.S. Department of Energy. The film shows green tech investor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaking to an oil and gas industry group stating, “The plants that we’re building, the wind plants and the solar plants, are gas plants.” Zehner discusses how companies including Apple and Tesla claim to run on 100% renewable energy despite remaining hooked up to the grid and reveals the Koch Brothers' involvement in green technology production. The film contains a three minute montage set to Emerson, Lake & Palmer’s “The Enemy God Dances with the Black Spirits,” which shows the scale of industrial mining required to create solar, wind, and electric vehicle technology. A bulldozer is shown destroying a 500 year old yucca plant to clear the land for what became the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility. Gibbs says that solar and wind arrays last only a few decades before “you tear it down, and start all over again.” Gibbs visits Steven Running, an ecologist from the University of Montana, who discusses planetary limits – including global fish production, agricultural land, water irrigation, and ground water. Gibbs ends the section by speaking to social-psychologist Sheldon Solomon positing whether faith in renewables could be a reflection of a fear of death. Gibbs sneaks onto a biomass plant property in Vermont and finds that instead of burning forest residue as advertised, the plant is surrounded by whole trees. A citizen activist in Michigan reveals that her local biomass plant burns PCP and creosote-treated railroad ties shipped in from Canada as well as rubber tires, which cause black snow to appear at the adjacent elementary school. Gibbs explores the practice of universities committing to \\"go green\\" by opening biomass plants on campus, tracing the practice back to a college in Middlebury, VT endorsed by Bill McKibben. Gibbs reveals that biomass energy remains the largest percentage of renewable energy in the world. He then explores what he calls the ‘language loopholes’ that allow for the continuation of biomass around the U.S. The section ends with Gibbs, as part of a media event at the Climate March in New York City, asking environmental leaders for their stance on biomass including Van Jones, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Bill McKibben, and Vandana Shiva. Only Shiva denounces biomass & biofuels. In the last third of the film, Gibbs explores the partnerships between mainstream environmental groups and Wall Street investors, billionaires, and wealthy family foundations. Gibbs reveals a tax return showing that the Sierra Club accepted 3 million dollars from timber investor Jeremy Grantham. McKibben is shown on stage with former Goldman Sachs executive David Blood, supporting his call to raise $40-50 trillion in green energy investments. Gibbs displays U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings of green funds promoted in divestment campaigns by 350.org's, Bill McKibben, and the Sierra Club, which show holdings in mining companies, oil and gas infrastructure, various banks including BlackRock, Halliburton, McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Exxon, Chevron, Gazprom, and Enviva among others. Gibbs shows corporate formation documents indicating that Al Gore partnered with David Blood to start Generation Investment Management – a sustainability investment fund – before releasing An Inconvenient Truth. Gibbs then shows Gore lobbying Congress on behalf of the sugarcane ethanol industry in Brazil, juxtaposing footage of indigenous cultures in Brazil being evicted from their land to create more sugarcane fields. Gibbs asserts that “the takeover of the environmental movement by capitalism is now complete,” and asks whether it has always been complete. The film shows McKibben stating that 350.org receives funding from The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation. He also shows Gore in multiple interviews defending his decision to sell his American television channel, Current TV, earning him an estimated $100 million pre-tax for the deal, to Al Jazeera which is owned by the State of Qatar, an oil and gas producer. Gibbs attends an Earth Day concert celebration in Washington, DC sponsored by Toyota, Citibank, and Caterpillar, where Dennis Hayes claims the entire event is run on solar energy. Backstage, Gibbs discovers the concert is actually being run by biodiesel generators. The film ends with Gibbs reflecting, “Infinite growth on a finite planet is suicide,” imploring the audience to take back the environmental movement from billionaires and capitalists. The final scene shows a mother and baby orangutan struggling to survive as the forest is logged and burned around them. Production and content 232x232px Planet of the Humans was written, directed, and narrated by Jeff Gibbs. Michael Moore served as executive producer. The producers of Planet of the Humans are Gibbs and Ozzie Zehner; co-producers are Valorie Gibbs, Christopher Henze and David Paxon; cinematography by Gibbs, Zehner, and Christopher Henze; editing by Gibbs and Angela Vargos; sound mixing by Christopher Henze. Gibbs also composed some of the film's score. Its content consists of energy-related footage, street interviews, formal interviews, and archival footage of businessmen and prominent environmental leaders. Footage includes satellite views of America's night skies, construction of a wind turbine, a solar fair, a wind farm construction site, a solar array owned by Lansing Power and Light Company, the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, biomass facilities, and public events where prominent environmental leaders were speaking. Interviews were done by a camera crew that identified themselves as being from New World Media during public events. These interviews were preceded by a number of formal interviews with Richard Heinberg, Ozzie Zehner, and Penn State anthropologist Nina Jablonski. The voice-over for much of the film was done by Jeff Gibbs.  Release  The film received its world premiere at the Traverse City Film Festival (TCFF) in July 2019. On 21 April 2020, the eve of Earth Day, Moore announced that the film would be available for free on YouTube for 30 days, which was later extended by another month because of high viewership. In an interview held at TCFF, Gibbs stated that \\"the film is not expected to be a comfortable beginning to the needed conversation\\" especially for those who treat solar and wind energy like \\"sacred cows\\". The Films For Action website originally promoted the documentary. After protests stating that \\"the film is full of misinformation\\", they removed the embedded link and published a statement listing multiple falsehoods and errors, including statements about environmental organizations and solar and wind power that were outdated or incorrect. On May 7, Films for Action restored the embedded link, stating their concern that \\"taking the film down in the context of Josh's retraction campaign was only going to create headlines, generate more interest in the film, and possibly lead people to think we're trying to 'cover up the truth,' giving the film more power and mystique than it deserves\\". On 25 May 2020, the film was temporarily removed from YouTube due to a copyright infringement claim by British environmental photographer Toby Smith over a 4-second segment Gibbs considered fair-use content. The controversial video had more than 8 million YouTube views at the time. Moore and Gibbs called the move a \\"blatant act of censorship\\" and disputed the claim with YouTube. The producers made the video available for free streaming on the competing Vimeo platform.  Factual accuracy  = Scientific accuracy = The movie was criticized as outdated and misleading by climate scientists. The film claims the carbon footprint of renewable energy is comparable to fossil fuels, when taking into account all different stages of their production. However, a large body of research shows the life-cycle emissions of wind and solar are much lower than fossil fuels. The film uses footage of a solar field that is up to a decade old, which critics argue gives a false impression of the maturity of the technologies in the present day. The movie hightlights a field of solar panels that operates with 8% efficiency of sunlight conversion, which is below the typical 15-20% efficiency of solar panels in use in 2020, and includes a statement that solar panels would only last 10 years, where the typical lifetime exceeds 20 years. The film also includes footage of a 10-year-old electric vehicle being recharged from a grid that is 95% powered by coal. The emissions intensity of electric vehicles varies depending on the source of electricity used to power the grid, however as of 2020, they emit less than internal combustion vehicles in all but a few of the world's regions. As of 2015, electric vehicles emit on average 31% less than internal combustion vehicles for the same distance travelled. The average power grid derived slightly more than 60% of its energy from fossil fuels in 2019. A pie chart is shown in the film with total battery storage compared to yearly energy use, which is a factor of thousand higher. The filmmakers suggest that this amount of energy storage is needed to make sure intermittency of renewables does not lead to power outages. In reality, battery storage is only part of solving intermittency, and using a mix of different energy sources reduces the need for batteries. In a letter, filmmaker and environmental activist Josh Fox and academics including climate scientist Michael Mann have asked for an apology and a retraction of the film. They say the film includes \\"various distortions, half-truths and lies\\", and that the filmmakers \\"have done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points\\".233x233px = Claims about the environmental movement = The Union of Concerned Scientists, which was mentioned in the movie, responded to the allegations: \\"it implies that UCS took money from corporations profiting from EVs, without (again) stopping to check the facts, or reaching out to UCS about it. It wouldn't have been hard, either way, to discover that UCS doesn't take corporate money at all\\". Environmentalist Bill McKibben responded to claims made in the documentary about him and the organization he cofounded, 350.org: > \\"A Youtube video emerged on Earth Day eve making charges about me and about > 350.org — namely that I was a supporter of biomass energy, and that 350 and > I were beholden to corporate funding, and have misled our supporters on the > costs and trade-offs related to decarbonizing our economy. These things > aren't true.\\" In Rolling Stone, McKibben continued: \\"the filmmakers didn't just engage in bad journalism (though they surely did), they acted in bad faith. They didn't just behave dishonestly (though they surely did), they behaved dishonorably. I'm aware that in our current salty era those words may sound mild, but in my lexicon they are the strongest possible epithets.\\"  Reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65%, based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 6.29/10. As of May 13, 2020, it had been viewed more than 7.5 million times on YouTube. Dennis Harvey in Variety claimed \\"Gibbs' dull monotone makes him a poor narrator\\", \\"there's nothing particularly elegant about the way Planet of the Humans arrives at its downbeat thesis,\\" and \\"though well-shot and edited, the material here is simply too sprawling to avoid feeling crammed into one ungainly package.\\" Gary Mason at The Globe and Mail referred to the film as \\"The Michael Moore-backed film enviros are dreading\\".The Michael Moore-backed film enviros are dreading, Globe and Mail, August 23, 2019 The Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial page wrote of the movie, \\"Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Moore critique wind energy for requiring enormous amounts of copper and rare earth minerals. Wind farms also require developing large tracts of land. Solar energy gets dinged for its dependence on mining coal and quartz. ... electric cars sound great, but they depend on the fossil-fuel-powered electrical grid.\\" University of California Professor environmental policy professor Leah Stokes, at Vox Magazine wrote that the movie undermines the work of young climate activists and that \\"Throughout, the filmmakers twist basic facts, misleading the public about who is responsible for the climate crisis. We are used to climate science misinformation campaigns from fossil fuel corporations. But from progressive filmmakers?\\" Dana Nucitelli of Yale Climate Connections claims \\"The film's case is akin to arguing that because fruit contains sugar, eating strawberries is no healthier than eating a cheesecake. The Post Carbon Institute, a sustainability think tank closely connected with interviewee Richard Heinberg, published a podcast that critiques the film's flaws. For Resilience, Heinberg has also written: \\"[The film] starts a conversation we need to have, and it's a film that deserves to be seen.\\" and \\"Mainstream enviros will hate this movie because it exposes some of their real failings. By focusing on techno-fixes, they have sidelined nearly all discussion of overpopulation and overconsumption.\\" Emily Atkin, environmental journalist for The New Republic, described the documentary as \\"an argumentative essay from a lazy college freshman\\". Environmental journalist Brian Kahn in Earther wrote that the filmmaker's choice to have \\"mostly white experts who are mostly men\\" argue in favor of population control gives the film \\"a bit more than a whiff of eugenics and ecofascism. [...] What's most frustrating about Gibbs' film is he walks right up to some serious issues and ignores clear solutions\\", Kahn concluded. InsideClimate News concluded that the movie \\"will almost certainly do far more harm than good in the struggle to reduce carbon emissions\\". Jacobin wrote that the film \\"embraces bad science on renewable energy and anti-humanist, anti–working class narratives of overpopulation and overconsumption\\", concluding that by \\"focusing on industrial civilization and 'overpopulation' as the cause of environmental problems, Moore and Gibbs distract us from the real problem: the untrammeled market.\\" Ted Nordhaus, an environmental policy writer and proponent of nuclear energy and industrial agriculture, noted that the bias in portraying renewables in the film \\"is a mirror image of the misinformation that the anti-nuclear movement has trafficked in for decades\\" and concluded the overall message of the film is neomalthusian. In The Guardian, George Monbiot wrote: \\"The film does not deny climate science. But it promotes the discredited myths that [climate change] deniers have used for years to justify their position. It claims that environmentalism is a self-seeking scam, doing immense harm to the living world while enriching a group of con artists\\". According to Monbiot, its \\"attacks on solar and wind power rely on a series of blatant falsehoods\\". Peter Bradshaw wrote for The Guardian that, despite its criticism of key environmental leaders, the video refrained from criticizing Greta Thunberg, a long-time advocate of such technologies. Bradshaw called the film \\"refreshingly contrarian.\\" Laura Schmidt, founder of the Good Grief Network, wrote \\"Planet of the Humans has triggered a vast polarization amongst those of us working towards a livable future.\\" Adrian Hennigan, features editor at Haaretz, called Planet of the Humans a \\"provocative documentary about how capitalism has destroyed the environmental movement.\\" and stated that \\"This cri de coeur from American producer-composer-editor Gibbs may lack balance and counterarguments, but it convincingly makes the case that “less must be the new more” if humankind is to have any chance of not being wiped out due to overpopulation and overconsumption.\\" Nonfictionfilm.com editor-in-chief, Matthew Carey, wrote: \\"Films about environmental issues have long been a staple of the documentary form, a genre that in recent years alone has brought us Before the Flood, Chasing Ice, Chasing Coral and, of course, An Inconvenient Truth. But those documentaries arguably pale in importance to Planet of the Humans\\" Julie Ann Grimm of the Santa Fe Reporter praised the film: \\"There’s a fine line between delusion and illusion. And both are part of the myth of a “clean energy” that magically lifts humanity from its crash course with the planet. Rather than drastically reduce our consumption of resources such as water, fossil fuels and hard-rock minerals, humans are more content to seek technological fixes that won’t work anyway. That is the thesis of Planet of the Humans. Move over, Al Gore. Henceforth, Earth Day belongs to Jeff Gibbs.\\" = Producers' response = Michael Moore, Jeff Gibbs, and Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of Rising. In the interview Gibbs states that > \\"we don't attack environmental leaders. We need our environmental leaders.\\" > Gibbs also states that \\"We went to great pains to show you what's happening > in the field of solar and wind. And many of our experts are in the solar and > wind industry\\". In summarizing his primary intent for making the movie, > Gibbs states that \\"I wanted to spark a holistic discussion about all the > things we humans are doing and whether these green technologies were even > going to solve climate change let alone all the other things happening > around the planet.\\" When pressed in the Rising interview about accusations that the film presents a Malthusian point of view, Gibbs responded that they never used the term \\"population control\\" and are not in favor of it, and added that a recent UN study on the extinction crisis also mentioned population growth and economic growth as the primary drivers of the crisis. Jeff Gibbs has said that the film is designed to prompt discussion and debate beyond the narrow issue of climate change and to look at the overall human impact on the environment, including issues such as human overpopulation and the contemporary extinction crisis in which half of all wildlife has disappeared in the last 40years, and whether green technology can solve these issues.  Old footage response  On 18 May, Gibbs replied directly to the accusations of using \\"old footage\\" arguing that while most of the footage was shot in 2019 and 2020, the videos of the popular solar festivals were shot twice, in an interval of 10 years, and usage of diesel generators was observed each time. He explained that the solar farm in Michigan they filmed continues to operate at 8% efficiency and will continue for decades and that manufacturing of panels will require mining non- renewable resources. He also accused the \\"eco-industrial complex\\" of attempting to \\"choke [the producers] to death\\", instead of \\"self-reflection\\". Alleged corporate take down A few weeks into its release, the film was removed from YouTube on alleged copyright violations by the use of footage without the consent of its original producer. The filmmakers challenged the take down and YouTube unblocked access to the film. American journalist Max Blumenthal alleged that those responsible were corporate environmentalists, the same ones profiting from the mainstream environmentalist ideology.

During the period following the Second World War he was one of the most important sculptors of monumental abstract stone sculptures. Life In 1912 Morice Lipsi, fourteen, left his Polish homeland to join his brother in Paris. He became a resident of the artist’s residence La Ruche, alongside many international artists such as Marc Chagall, Chaim Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani, Ossip Zadkine and Guillaume Apollinaire. In 1927 he met the Swiss painter Hildegard Weber (1901-2000) in Paris; they married three years later. In 1933 Lipsi became a French citizen and moved to Chevilly-Larue near Paris.. Sikart, the digital lexicon of art in Switzerland. In 1942 he fled to Switzerland because of his Jewish origins. After the war he returned to Chevilly-Larue, where he chiefly lived and worked for the following decades. In 1983 he was made a Commander of the ‘Ordre des Arts et des Lettres’ for his significant contributions to art. In 1984 French President François Mitterrand made him a Knight of the Legion of Honour. In 1982 he moved to Küsnacht-Goldbach near Zurich, where he died in 1986.Gabrielle Beck-Lipsi: Morice Lipsi 1898 – 1986, Neuchâtel, 2018. Artistic development =Early years and the period between the wars= Groupe de deux femmes (1939), situated in Parc Montsouris, Paris. From very early on, Lipsi showed great talent for drawing. From 1912 he learnt how to carve ivory from his much older brother Samuel Lypchytz (1875-1942) in Paris. From 1916 he studied briefly at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, with professors Jules Coutan, Antonin Mercié and Jean Antoine Injalbert. He then began to experiment by himself with sculpture, developing a style of his own. First successes started to happen. In 1922 he had his first solo exhibition of ivory sculptures at the Galerie Hébrard in Paris. Further exhibitions soon followed in Paris at the Galerie d’art contemporain (1927) and the Galerie Druet (1935). In 1930 he first exhibited abroad, in the Zürcher Kunstsalon of Dr. Störi. In 1931 he took part in the international sculpture exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zürich. For the Paris World’s Fair in 1937 Lipsi was commissioned to design a gable relief above the Pont Alexandre III entrance portal, and a relief in the Pavilion of the Architects Club. During this early period he created sculptures inspired by Auguste Rodin and works tending towards Art Deco. Despite being friends with Ossip Zadkine and Henri Laurens and in contact with other members of the avant-garde such as Alberto Giacometti, Constantin Brancusi and Fernand Léger, Lipsi’s work remained untouched by abstract sculpture. He regularly visited Chartres Cathedral for study purposes, sometimes with Henri Laurens. Apart from ivory figures, he created sculptures in wood, cement, plaster, limestone, baked clay and bronze. During the early war years Lipsi had to make a living through regional commissions in the Charente. These were mainly works on religious motifs, done in an antiquing, strictly figurative style. Sikart. In 1945 we find Lipsi in the Kunsthalle Bern, alongside Marino Marini, Germaine Richier and Fritz Wotruba. =The period after the Second world war= 0céanique I (1963), situated in the quarry, Atami, Japan. Soon after the war Lipsi’s oeuvre took a turn towards abstraction. For his increasingly abstract stone figures he used the direct carving (taille directe) process – chiselling directly into the stone by hand. From 1955 he was particularly interested in working in lava stone. These new works, tending towards the monumental, attracted a quite different audience and a lot of international attention. Countless exhibitions in galleries and museums followed. In 1959 Lipsi participated in the documenta II in Kassel, and the renowned Paris Galerie Denise René organized a solo exhibition for him. In 1963, 1964 and 1967 Lipsi took part in International Sculpture Symposia in Japan, Slovakia and France (as president). This period culminated in the works Océanique I and the 12 m high Ouverture dans l’espace, prominently placed in the public space during the Olympic Games in Tokyo 1964 and Grenoble in 1968 – in Tokyo in front of the Olympic Stadium, in Grenoble by the main road into town. During the following years Lipsi was much in demand as a sculptural designer for public spaces, with commissions throughout France, a state gift from France to Iceland, and purchases from Germany and Israel. During the later post-war years Lipsi was one of the most important exponents of large stone sculptures. Sikart. From 1979 Lipsi, for health reasons, worked mainly as a draughtsman. Since his death, works by Morice Lipsi are still being regularly exhibited in public galleries and museums.

She has also worked extensively in researching the roundtable and her work is compiled in the unpublished Archivists of Color Directory. When a history of the roundtable was being compiled, Jefferson was quoted in an interview on the importance of diversity to the archival profession: “Archives must ensure that all people are included in the historical record of humankind.” In 1996/1997, the SAA Council appointed a Task Force on Organizational Effectiveness with one of their main issues being how to address diversity. The Council chose to create a Task Force on Diversity, with Karen Jefferson as a member as well as Kathleen Roe, Susan Fox and Deborah King. The task force was to investigate how the SAA was addressing, or not, issues of diversity. In their discussions, they examined the SAA's organizational structure and how it could change to reinforce existing activities as well as how it could encourage diversity as a whole in the archival profession and the Society. She has served the SAA in several ways: on the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, Award Subcommittees, the Task Force on Diversity, as a member of the Publications Board, and as part of the Society's Council from 1997-2000.

History The union was founded on the initiative of Fritz Zietsch, editor of Die Ameise, the Germany pottery workers' journal. In 1905, he wrote to unions of pottery workers from around Europe, and those from Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom attended the founding meeting of the international in Berlin later in the year. The first triennial congress was held in Limoges in 1906, followed by Florence in 1909 and Hanley in 1912. The federation's objectives included providing support to affiliates involved in industrial disputes, and improvements in working hours and health and safety. The federation ceased to operate during World War I, but it was revived after the war, on the initiative of the British and German unions, with a Czech union joining those from France, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands at its first congress, back in Berlin. The federation operated effectively until 1933, when due to the rise of the Nazis, the German union largely ceased to operate. The federation's headquarters had already been moved to Czechoslovakia, and Ernst Roll was appointed as its acting secretary. With the French union unable to afford to send representatives to meetings in other countries, and the Austrian union ceasing to operate, in 1935 the International Federation of Trade Unions took action. The IFPW was merged into the International Federation of General Factory Workers. Initially, it continued to act as a distinct section, holding a conference in Hanley in 1937, with each delegate given a musical mug. Two years later, the Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish unions attempted to reform the IFPW, but World War II started before anything concrete happened.

The rudimental system used was very similar to that of the British Army, owing to Ashworth's birth in England and the relative youth of the United States as an independent country. Many similarities can be seen with Samuel Potter's 1815 book Art of Beating the Drum, a standard of British drumming published in London, though there are also some marked differences.

She was the co-creator and organizer of the Summer Music summer school in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. Biography Jacqueline Froom was born in Croydon in 1929, the only child of Sidney and Kathleen Froom. Her father was a civil servant at the Admiralty. She attended Whyteleafe School for Girls and had planned to go to university. In the late 1940s, returning servicemen took most of the university places and she did not secure a place. Froom attended the Central School of Speech and Drama before taking up a secretarial post with the Radio Times. She then continued in publishing, spending some years with Brockhampton Press and ultimately as assistant to the Music Editor at Oxford University Press. While there she met several composers including Alun Hoddinott, Kenneth Leighton and Graham Treacher, and began writing texts and translations for them. Froom met Jonathan Hinden, a member of the music staff at Glyndebourne, when he was the accompanist for her singing class and they married in 1968. In the same year she started the annual Summer Music Summer School with her friend Murray Gordon, which continued until 2005. Froom became an enthusiastic Bridge player, obtained an Area Community Service Employment and Training Council qualification and taught Bridge and Creative Writing for the local Adult Education in Brighton. She played for one of the Sussex County teams. Froom received an Master of Arts from the University of Sussex in creative writing. At 63, she was their oldest student. In her later years, Froom concentrated on poetry. She won several competitions, notably second place in the 2008 Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry, and published a volume of her poems. Summer Music Summer School Summer Music logo In the late 1960s, Froom had attended various music courses with her friend Murray Gordon, and they started running residential weekends. In 1968, they started the Summer Music summer school for singers and string players in Bexhill-on- Sea in 1968. The summer school grew into a major annual event with, at its peak in the late 1980s, some 300 students. There were also courses for accompanists, guitarists and children. It was notable for the family feeling it retained to the end, and there was great loyalty among the students and the tutors. Several regulars met their life partners there and returned with their children. The Summer School re-located to Herstmonceux, Bushey and Wellington College, ending at Ardingly College. When Murray Gordon retired in the early 1990s, Froom continued with Jonathan Hinden taking over the programming and business sides.

It was developed as part of a joint research project between the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Westchester County, New York and IBM in 1964–1966 for investigation of the use of computer-based simulations in schools. It was designed by Mabel Addis, then a fourth-grade teacher, and programmed by William McKay for the IBM 7090 time-shared mainframe computer. The first version of the game was played by a group of 30 sixth-grade students in 1964, and a revised version featuring refocused gameplay and added narrative and audiovisual elements was played by a second group of students in 1966. The game is composed of three segments, representing the reigns of three successive rulers of the city of Lagash in Sumer around 3500 BC. In each segment the game asks the players how to allocate workers and grain over a series of rounds while accommodating the effects of their prior decisions, random disasters, and technological innovations, with each segment adding complexity. At the conclusion of the project the game was abandoned; a description of it was given to Doug Dyment in 1968, however, and he recreated a version of the first segment of the game as King of Sumeria. This game was expanded on in 1971 by David H. Ahl as Hamurabi, which in turn led to many early strategy and city-building games. The Sumerian Game has been described as the first video game with a narrative, as well as the first edutainment game. As a result, Mabel Addis has been called the first female video game designer and the first writer for a video game. Gameplay alt=Girl sitting at a teleprinter with an image of a Mesopotamian city behind her The Sumerian Game is a largely text-based strategy video game centered on resource management. The game, set around 3500 BC, has players act as three successive rulers of the city of Lagash in Sumer—Luduga I, II, and III—over three segments of increasingly complex economic simulation. Two versions of the game were created, both intended for play by a classroom of students with a single person inputting commands into a teleprinter, which would output responses from the mainframe computer. The second version had a stronger narrative component to the game's text and interspersed the game with taped audio lectures, presented as the discussions of the ruler's court of advisors, corresponding with images on a slide projector. In both versions, the player enters numbers in response to questions posed by the game. In the first segment of the game, the player plays a series of rounds—limited to 30 in the second version of the game—in which they are given information about the current population, acres of farmland, number of farmers, grain harvested that round, and stored grain. The rounds start in 3500 BC, and are meant to represent seasons. The player then selects how much grain will be used as food, seed for planting, and storage. After making their selections, the game calculates the effect of the player's choices on the population for the next round. Additionally, after each round, the game selects whether to report several events. The city may be struck with a random disaster, such as a fire or flood, which destroys a percentage of the city's population and harvest. Independent of disasters, a percentage of the stored grain may also be lost to rot and rats. Additionally, the game may report a technological innovation which has a positive effect on subsequent rounds, such as reducing the amount of grain that may spoil or reducing the number of farmers needed for each acre of land. Several of these innovations require the player to have first \\"exhibited some good judgement\\", such as by adequately feeding their population for multiple rounds. In the second and third segments of the game, the city's population and grain are adjusted to preset levels, regardless of the player's performance in the prior segment, to represent that some time has passed since the decisions of the prior ruler. The player then again plays through a series of rounds. In the second segment, the player can also apply workers towards the development of several crafts—which in turn can result in innovations—while the third increases the complexity of the simulation by adding trade and expansion choices. In the original version of the game, the second and third segments were expansions on the first, requiring the same choices around grain in addition to the new choices. In the second version of the game, the second segment was refocused. The rounds were limited to 10 and the player was no longer required to make choices around grain allocation, but instead only make decisions about applying workers to farming or crafts. The third segment was not changed, though plans were made to either also remove the grain allocation choices and add more choices around trade, colonization, and war, or else to instead make the third segment a combination of the first two segments. Development In 1962, the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) of Westchester County, New York, began a series of discussions with researchers at IBM about the use of computers in education research. The BOCES system had been established in New York to help rural school districts pool resources, and the Westchester BOCES Superintendent Dr. Noble Gividen believed that computers, along with computer simulation games like the Carnagie Tech Management Game being used in colleges, could be used to improve educational outcomes at small districts in Westchester. BOCES and IBM held a joint workshop, led by Bruse Moncreiff and James Dinneen of IBM along with Dr. Richard Wing, curriculum research coordinator for BOCES, in June 1962, involving ten teachers from the area to discuss ways of using simulations in classroom curricula. Based on the result of the workshop, BOCES applied for a grant from the U.S. Office of Education that December to continue to study the concept for 18 months, receiving almost instead for \\"Cooperative Research Project 1948\\". The project began in February 1963 under the direction of Dr. Wing, who asked for proposals from nine teachers. One of the teachers, Mabel Addis, proposed an expansion of an idea made by Moncreiff at the summer workshop: an economic model of a civilization, intended to teach basic economic theory. Moncreiff had been inspired by prior research, especially the paper \\"Teaching through Participation in Micro-simulations of Social Organization\\" by Richard Neier, and by the board game Monopoly, and wanted to use the ancient Sumerian civilization as the setting to counter what he saw as a trend in school curriculum to ignore pre-Greek civilizations, despite evidence of their importance to early history. Addis, a fourth-grade teacher at Katonah Elementary School, agreed with Moncreiff about the undervaluation of pre-Greek civilizations in schools, and had studied Mesoptamian civilizations in college. Her proposal was approved, and she began work with IBM programmer William McKay to develop the game. The game itself, The Sumerian Game, was designed and written by Addis and programmed by McKay in the Fortran programming language for an IBM 7090 time-shared mainframe computer. Like many early mainframe games, it was only run on a single computer. Commands were entered and results printed with an IBM 1050 teleprinter. The researchers ran one play session with 30 sixth-grade students. Project 1948 concluded in August 1964, and a report on its outcome given to the Office of Education in 1965 listing the eight \\"subprojects\\" that had been proposed in it, of which The Sumerian Game was the only game. Two weeks after its conclusion a new project was started as Cooperative Research Project 2148, with two more grants given totaling over , focusing on the first project's progress with the game and to run through 1967. This project created three games: The Sierra Leone Game, The Free Enterprise Game, and an expansion of The Sumerian Game. Addis rewrote and expanded the game in the summer of 1966 by adding a stronger narrative flow to how the advisor tells the player about the events of the city, refocusing the second segment of the game on the new concepts introduced, and interspersing the game with taped audio lectures corresponding with images on a slide projector. These have been described as the first cutscenes. The researchers conducted a playtest of the new version of the game with another 30 sixth-grade students the following school year, and produced a report in 1967. Legacy Following the creation of the second version of The Sumerian Game, the first segment of the game was reprogrammed by Jimmer Leonard, a graduate student in Social Relations at Johns Hopkins University, for the IBM 1401, to be used at demonstrations at a terminal in the BOCES Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. The project was mentioned in Time and Life magazines in 1966. After the conclusion of the second project in 1967, however, BOCES did not receive funds to extend the project further, and as per the agreement with IBM all three games became the property of the company. IBM did not attempt to use them as part of any further educational initiatives. In 1968, however, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) employee Doug Dyment gave a talk about computers in education at the University of Alberta, and after the talk a woman who had once seen The Sumerian Game described it to him. Dyment decided to recreate the game as an early program for the FOCAL programming language, recently developed at DEC, and programmed it for a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. He named the result King of Sumeria. Needing the game to run in the smallest memory configuration available for the computer, he included only the first segment of the game. He also chose to rename the ruler to the more famous Babylonian king Hammurabi, misspelled as \\"Hamurabi\\". Dyment's game, sometimes retitled The Sumer Game, proved popular in the programming community: Jerry Pournelle recalled in 1989 that \\"half the people I know wrote a Hammurabi program back in the 1970s; for many, it was the first program they'd ever written in their lives\\". Around 1971, DEC employee David H. Ahl wrote a version of The Sumer Game in the BASIC programming language. Unlike FOCAL, BASIC was run not just on mainframe computers and minicomputers, but also on personal computers, then termed microcomputers, making it a much more popular language. In 1973, Ahl published BASIC Computer Games, a best-selling book of games written in BASIC, which included his version of The Sumer Game. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi and added an end-of-game performance appraisal. In addition to the multiple versions of Hamurabi, several simulation games have been created as expansions of the core game. These include Kingdom (1974) by Lee Schneider and Todd Voros, which was then expanded to Dukedom (1976). Other derivations include King (1978) by James A. Storer, and Santa Paravia en Fiumaccio (1978) by George Blank; Santa Paravia added the concept of city building management to the basic structure of Hamurabi, making The Sumerian Game an antecedent to the city-building genre as well as an early strategy game. As The Sumerian Game was created during the early history of video games as part of research into new uses for computer simulations, it pioneered several developments in the medium. In addition to being a prototype of the strategy and city-building genres, The Sumerian Game has been described as the first video game with a narrative, as well as the first edutainment game. As a result, Mabel Addis has been called the first female video game designer and the first writer for a video game. The original code for The Sumerian Game is lost, but the projector slides and three printouts of individual game sessions were found in 2012 and donated to The Strong National Museum of Play, where they are kept in the Brian Sutton-Smith Library and Archives of Play.

It was initially written in Cantonese and was eventually developed into various language versions. It has been widely adopted as the anthem of these protests, with some even regarding it as the \\"national anthem of Hong Kong\\". Since widespread protests in Hong Kong erupted in early June 2019, various songs that symbolise democracy, such as \\"Do You Hear The People Sing\\" from Les Misérables, have been sung by protesters on different occasions as their anthems. \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\", according to the composer, was created \\"to boost protesters' morale and unite people\\". Since the song's publication, it has been sung at most demonstrations. There are also numerous versions in English and other languages circulating the web. Background Thomas, a music composer and Cantonese-language lyricist, first posted an instrumental version of \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" and its lyrics on 26 August 2019 to LIHKG, an online forum where pro-democracy Hongkongers exchange views. After receiving suggestions from the forum users, he modified the lyrics, including the incorporation of the phrase \\"Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times\\" (), a motto at the protests. The song's music video, comprising scenes from demonstrations, was uploaded to YouTube on 31 August 2019. The song went viral within a few days across various social media, followed by the emergence of versions in English and other languages. An orchestral music video with SATB chorus was uploaded to YouTube on 11 September 2019, pulling 1.5 million views within a week. Hong Kong protesters previously sung \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" and \\"Sing Hallelujah to the Lord\\" as protest anthems, before adopting \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" as their main anthem. In an interview with Time magazine, the author-composer said: \\"Music is a tool for unity, I really felt like we needed a song to unite us and boost our morale. The message to listeners is that despite the unhappiness and uncertainty of our time, Hong Kong people will not surrender.\\" In an interview with Stand News, the composer explained his motivation to compose a new protest song for Hong Kong in place of songs commonly sung during protests such as \\"Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies\\" and \\"Glory Days\\", two songs by Hong Kong band Beyond, describing the songs as \\"not unpleasant to listen to\\", but that their rhythm was somewhat out of place with the atmosphere during protests. The composer said he was predominantly a pop rock artist, noting that a classical-style production like \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" was a personal first. Inspired by \\"God Save the Queen\\", \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\", the national anthem of Russia, the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" and \\"Gloria in Excelsis Deo\\" by Antonio Vivaldi, he spent two months composing the song's melody working backwards from the line “May people reign, proud and free”. The song was observed by to have similar motives to Roman Tam's \\"Below the Lion Rock\\", a Cantopop song highly regarded among Hong Kongers in association with the sense of the region's common spirit. Origin of the title Orchestra in black bloc playing the march Glory to Hong Kong The word \\"glory\\" (榮光) in the song title consists of the Chinese characters for honour () and brilliance (). The term has been used in poems by Li Bai and a prose by Lu Xun, in addition to being a common term used by Christians. The composer noted that he was irreligious, and described the last sentence \\"Glory be to Hong Kong\\" () as his twofold wish: that Hong Kong can regain its glory in the future, and that Hongkongers are willing to dedicate their pride and triumphs to the city. While this is largely an antiquated term in modern Chinese, it is still in common usage in modern Vietnamese (), Japanese (; eikō) and Korean (). Lyrics \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" comprises four stanzas of lyrics in Cantonese. The author states that he prioritised the meaning of the lyrics over the rhyming of lines, and explains the meaning of each stanza as follows: The first stanza solemnly describes the suppression and deprivation of fundamental human rights, such as democracy, liberty and justice. The second stanza describes the anti-ELAB movement, where the people stand up to injustice even though blood is shed. The solemness follows that in the first stanza. The third stanza describes the perseverance of Hong Kong people in darkness and despair. It is performed with slightly less solemn character. The final stanza, with the most recognisable motto \\"Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times\\" incorporated in the lyrics, envisages that the city will regain its glory and honour. It expresses hope for the future, ending the song with excitement. =Other languages= Various versions of English lyrics have appeared online, with the most notable version from \\"Seven Swords Spring and Autumn\\" (literal translation from Chinese: 七劍浣春秋) on LIHKG on 7 September 2019. Shek Ga-mak, a Hong Kong expatriate in Germany, released German lyrics for the song on 11 September 2019. Japanese lyrics for the song were also released by an anonymous Japanese person on 18 September 2019. Members of Action Free Hong Kong Montreal performed a French version written by netizen assuming pseudonym \\"Montreal Guy\\", which was uploaded to YouTube on 26 September 2019. Pícnic per la República released and sung a Catalan version on 24 October 2019 in front of the Chinese Consulate of Barcelona. A Taiwanese version was premiered by the indie band The Chairman during a solidarity concert in Taipei on 17 November 2019. Public use Times Square, Causeway Bay Football fans singing the song during Hong Kong's match against Iran on 10 September Around 1000 people singing the song \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" in New Town Plaza The song has been sung on numerous occasions by citizens in the public all over the city. 200 people participated in a sit-in at Prince Edward station on 6 September 2019, requesting MTR to hand over footage of the attacks on passengers conducted by police on 31 August; in addition to chanting slogans, the protesters sang this anthem and \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\". A few hundred people sang the song together at Cityplaza on 9 September. On 10 September, Hong Kong football supporters sang the song at a match for the first time during a FIFA World Cup qualification match against Iran, booing the Chinese anthem. On the same night, the song was again publicly sung by large groups at more than a dozen shopping malls across Hong Kong at 8:31 pm, a reference to both the police attacks on 31 August and the 2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong which was declared on 31 August 2014. On 11 September, around 100 people sang the song together in a memorial meeting for a suicide victim held at Ka Shing Court in Fanling. Around 500 students from 10 secondary schools in Kwun Tong District, Tseung Kwan O and Kowloon City District organized a human chain, in which they sang the song. Around 1000 people sang the song in New Town Plaza together that night, with crowds of people singing the song in other shopping malls around Hong Kong as well. Reception Robyn Dixon and Marcus Yam of Los Angeles Times described \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" as having \\"a more indigenous, electric, unifying effect\\" when compared to songs that were previously used at the protests. The march's Cantonese lyrics, in particular, affirms a sense of a collective cultural identity which is at the heart of the conflict. The lyrics evokes a sense of pride and belonging to Hong Kongers who struggle for identity after the 1997 hand-over to China. The hymn-like composition was also seen as \\"supremely approachable\\" to the populace who were accustomed to the Christian music tradition introduced by the region's British and missionary-influenced educational system. The Chinese edition of Deutsche Welle named \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" the \\"anthem\\" of the Hong Kong protests. The Chinese edition of Voice of America describes the lyrics of the song as reflecting the heartfelt views of protestors. Taiwanese newspaper Liberty Times described the song as \\"the military march of protesters\\" (), singing their anxiety towards Hong Kong's political situation, as well as an \\"unrelenting revolutionary spirit\\". Describing the song, Chinese Television System News noted that the song had \\"peaceful vocals coupled with scenes of bloody conflicts between Hong Kong Police and the people\\" and that by creating \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\", Hongkongers recorded their \\"history of struggling for democracy and freedom\\". Chow Po- chung, a professor of politics and public administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong noted that the song's melody and lyrics resonated with many people and united protesters, leading to many people developing great \\"attachment\\" to the song. Former President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Jasper Tsang praised the song as a high-quality technical production, believing it to be produced by professional musicians. He said that the song shows that the government's efforts at promotion have been weak. Wen Wei Po, a state-owned newspaper controlled by the Hong Kong Liaison Office, published an article on its front page on 12 September, criticising the song as the anthem for Hong Kong independence, and that the lyrics idealize violence. The title of the article 獨歌洗腦，煽走獨路 may be translated as \\"independence song brainwashes, touting independence as the route [for Hong Kong]\\", though \\"independence\\" may be treated as a pun for \\"poison\\" in this context due to its Chinese pronunciation. Carmen Poon published an article in Ming Pao on 13 September entitled \\"the brainwashing song that trumpets Hong Kong independence\\" (), in which she describes the \\"elegant lyrics\\" of the song as \\"advocating hate\\", and that \\"seeds of violence and hatred have been sown into the brainwashing song, causing people to inadvertently dance to its baton and commit bad behaviour\\". The song has been described as the unofficial anthem of Hong Kong, and some protesters stated they felt that \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" should replace the Chinese national anthem \\"March of the Volunteers\\" as the national anthem of Hong Kong; to which, the composer insisted that the song can only be a protest song: \\"There is no nation. How can there be a national anthem?\\" On the other hand, an opinion piece by Brian C. Thompson, a Chinese University of Hong Kong senior lecturer, for The Globe and Mail argues that despite only a \\"few\\" minority of the protesters are demanding for a separate state, the march is used as a thematic anthem representing the collective demands of the Hong Kong people – which are also considered \\"a nation [...]. A state may be home to multiple nations...\\" – therefore the march can still be regarded as \\"national\\" in nature. There were also slight criticism with how the march was made in terms of - its lyrics were seen in a professional sense as \\"clumsy\\" and its melodic range not only \\"too wide for most amateur singers\\" to which its lyrics' spoken tones are not synched by. The song has gained a huge popularity in Ukraine, as for the result of the song's name and slogan was inspired by the traditional Ukrainian slogan \\"Слава Україні! Героям слава!\\" (Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!) The Hong Kong's slogan version was also used by Ukrainian protesters in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters.  Controversies  Anita Lee, a host of Vancouver-based Chinese-language radio station CJVB, received complaints from local Chinese residents after playing \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" live on radio. She rejected rumours that she was suspended, whilst refusing to comment further. Apple Daily published an article on 15 September, quoting RTHK staff who claimed to have received a notice from their managers on 12 September which told them not to play the song outside of news and phone-in programmes for the needs of \\"news broadcasting\\" due to its ties with Hong Kong independence. The article also quoted that the song should be deleted from recordings of shows where previously played, due to an alleged violation of the RTHK Charter which states that RTHK should fulfil the purpose of \\"engendering a sense of citizenship and national identity through programmes that contribute to the understanding of [Hong Kong's] community and nation\\". After holding meetings with employees, Director of Broadcasting Leung Ka-wing instead said that the song was to be avoided due to its controversial nature. Responding to the newspaper's enquiry, Ng Man-yee of RTHK responded that its management has not banned \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\", has not deleted the song from its database, and as far as she knows, has not discouraged playing the song. Lai Rifu, a Weiquan dissident, was arrested by Guangzhou police for picking quarrels and provoking trouble on 16 September. On 13 September, Lai had shared a video to WeChat and Facebook, which showed scenery around his home town and used the song as its background music, with the caption \\"This is my homeland, I want her to be free!\\" On 18 September, around 20 pro-democracy activists, including Civic Party legislator Kwok Ka-ki, Civil Human Rights Front convener Jimmy Sham and members of the League of Social Democrats rallied to the Hong Kong Liaison Office, demanding the release of Lai. The activists chanted slogans and sang the song outside the Liaison Office's entrance. = Copyright infringement by secondary creations = On 12 September, a video titled \\"Glory to Hong Kong (Police Version MV)\\" (Chinese: 《願榮光歸香港》警察版MV) appeared on YouTube. It uses the original song and lyrics in audio, paired with scenes of Hong Kong Police using tear gas and other crowd-control weapons on protesters. On the screen, however, the lyrics \\"Revolution of our Times\\" were replaced with \\"Mission of the Police\\". Since being uploaded, this MV had received criticism from netizens which were removed later that night. Timelapse photographer Francis So condemned the MV on his Facebook page, stating that the timelapse of the night view of Hong Kong near the end of the video infringes his copyright. Cable TV also made a statement regarding clips from i-CABLE News used in the video, saying that they would retain the right to pursue all copyright infringements. Following this incident, another video titled \\"May Truth be Bestowed Upon Hong Kong\\" (Chinese: 願真理救香港) appeared. It used the instrumentals of \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\", but lyrics were rewritten by someone under the pseudonym \\"a person who loves Hong Kong\\" (Chinese: 愛港的人) to praise the Hong Kong Police Force and to fight against \\"rioters\\". Lin Xi made a remark stating that the use of instrumentals from the original \\"did not give a sense of violation, and was like a match made in heaven\\". He opined that the problem was the definition of \\"rioters, whether they were those who abused their power to arrest and beat up people or the powerless force that was attempting to fight back\\". This MV was reuploaded to Sina Weibo by various Chinese communist official organisations, such as the People's Daily and the Communist Youth League. On 28 September, the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement, a YouTube channel named \\"Channel Me\\" uploaded a video titled \\"Peace Upon Hong Kong\\" (Chinese: 願平安歸香港). It was a video spoof of the orchestral MV of \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" by Black Blorchestra. It was also re-uploaded to other social media, including Junius Ho's Facebook page. All uploads of this song were later blocked by Content ID claims by Denise Ho's label Goomusic. Following the enactment of Hong Kong national security law, some phrases in this song (particularly references to protest chant liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times) were deemed \\"separatist and subversive\\" by the government, thus illegal under Hong Kong law.

Ferrari intended to produce at least fifty examples for homologation by the CSI in the Sport 2.0 L Group 4 category. As only 18 were made, the car had to compete in the Prototype 2.0-litre class instead. In spite of this handicap the Dino 206 S took many class wins. The 206 S was the last of the Dino sports racing cars and simultaneously the most produced. Development The Dino 206 S had two immediate predecessors. The first was the 1965 Dino 166 P that was the first sports prototype model for the Dino marque and previewed the new rear-engined chassis and revised bodywork. The other, 206 SP, was a starting point for the final 65° DOHC race engine evolution. The first example of the 206 S model range, s/n 0842, was converted from the 166 P that did not participate in any races. Second example, s/n 0852, still shared the chassis number sequence with Ferrari race cars and was subsequently renumbered as s/n 002, the first in Dino race car sequence. The 206 S was bodied by Piero Drogo's Carrozzeria Sports Cars in the same style as before, evoking bigger Ferrari prototype cars. The majority were bodied in a spyder style with a roll-bar behind the driver. Only three examples were originally created as fully closed berlinettas. A handful of cars were later rebodied as an open barchettas. One of the Dino 206 S chassis was used for the Ferrari 212 E Montagna, a uniquely-engined, one-off hillclimb-oriented sports car. In 1967, at the Frankfurt Auto Show, Pininfarina presented a concept car based on a penultimate 206 S chassis, the Dino Berlinetta Competizione. It was designed by Paolo Martin, and was his first design for the Turin-based studio. Specifications Spyder, rear view The 65° V6 engine, mounted longitudinally in the rear, displaced 2.0-litres () from of bore and stroke. The earliest version, tipo 227L, had two valves per cylinder. Later types 231 and 231B received an experimental 3-valve heads. All had twin overhead camshafts per bank. This Dino engine received a newly designed combustion chamber derived directly from the Formula One experience. The compression ratio was between 10.8 and 11:1. Most engines were equipped with three classic Weber 40DCN15 carburettors but some received the Lucas indirect fuel injection. Either one or two spark plugs per cylinder were installed. The resulting power output was at 9000 rpm. As a race engine it also used dry sump lubrication. Top speed was 260–270 km/h. The drive train consisted of a 5-speed, non-synchro, manual transmission and twin-plate clutch. The chassis type 585, was an evolution of the one already tried in racing and was created out of a welded tubular frame. The front and rear suspension was fully independent. The wheelbase was shared with both its predecessors. The car used disc brakes all-round and the fuel tank had 100-litres capacity. Racing Guichet and Baghetti driving to a second place at 1966 Targa Florio The first racing result was a fifth place in the 1966 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by Lorenzo Bandini and Ludovico Scarfiotti. Three cars entered the Targa Florio the same year under Ferrari SEFAC team. Jean Guichet and Giancarlo Baghetti finished the race in second place also with a class win. Other cars finished fourteenth and not at all. 1000 km Spa netted sixth and first in the prototype class for Richard Attwood and Jean Guichet. At the 1000 km Nürburgring, Scarfiotti and Bandini won the Prototype 2.0 class being second overall. Their Dino was 90 seconds behind the 5.4-litre Chaparral.\\"Italians Are Next In 2-Liter Ferrari\\", New York Times, June 6, 1966, Page 57. Third was Pedro Rodríguez and Richie Ginther's car out of four Dino cars that entered. Rodriguez also scored a class win at the Nassau Trophy. At the Brands Hatch GP circuit, Mike Parkes scored sixth overall and first in class. The Dino 206 S won VI Coppa Citta di Enna. Also in 1966, the Swiss Mountain Grand Prix was won by Ludovico Scarfiotti. In 1967, Swedish driver Gustaf Dieden finished Swedish National Falkenberg and GP Swerige in fifth and ninth respectively. Ferdinando \\"Codones\\" Latteri and Pietro Lo Piccolo scored many overall and class wins between 1967 and 1969. =Hillclimbing= Dino 206 S in 1966 driven by Edoardo Lualdi-Gabardi, winner of Trofeo Città di Orvieto Ludovico Scarfiotti, a 1962 and 1965 European Hill Climb champion entered, with success, many hillclimb events in the 206 S. His 1965 championship was achieved in an earlier Dino model, the 206 SP. From June 1966, he contested the series as part of a Scuderia Sant'Ambroeus entry. He drove a works prototype Dino, s/n 0842. Scarfiotti scored a second place at Rossfeld and an overall win in the Cesana-Sestriere hillclimb. The Freiburg-Schauinsland hillclimb also yielded a second position with another victory at Sierre- Montana. And so for 1966, Ludovico Scarfiotti achieved a second overall place at the European Hill Climb Championship, behind Gerhard Mitter in a dominant Porsche 910 Coupé. Next year he participated in a one more hillclimb, this time at the very challenging Trento-Bondone, finishing second overall and a second in class as well. A Scuderia Sant'Ambroeus also fielded Edoardo Lualdi- Gabardi in the hillclimbing events. Lualdi had raced two cars throughout the 1966–1968. In 1966, his 206 S Spyder s/n 016, was used in no less than fifteen different hillclimbing races, winning six of them overall, with additional four-second places and simultaneous class wins to his name. For the 1967 and 1968 seasons he changed into yet another Spyder model, this time s/n 028, that he entered privately. Throughout those two seasons he entered thirty-four races, most of them of a hillclimbing nature. He won overall or in class at least twenty of them, with another seven second places on the podium. One of the victories was at the 1967 Trieste-Opicina hillclimb. In 1966, he placed sixth at the Trento-Bondone Hill Climb, but was unable to finish the dramatic race on the next two occasions. Collectability The Dino 206 S race cars from the period are collectable but are not fetching as high prices as their bigger Ferrari siblings. It is mostly due to a lesser engines and niche race series that they participated in. Also the Dino marque history is not all that well known to the public. The cars usually have a race history and are limited in numbers. Chassis number 006 car with an original Piero Drogo bodywork was sold in 2012 at RM Sotheby's auction for €2.5 million. The same auction house offered a s/n 028 car, as driven by Edoardo Lualdi-Gabardi in various hillclimbing events, but extensively converted at the later stage of its career. It still achieved a high bid of €2 million. More recently, in 2015, Gooding & Company auctioned the 206 S Spyder from the Peter Klutt collection, s/n 026 for US$2.3 million.

History The building was opened as a church in 1912 with seating for exactly 1,000 people. It was built, on the site of an earlier pedimented 18th century chapel, at a cost of £7,250 for a long-standing Baptist congregation which had been established by theologian Christopher Anderson in January 1808.. The architects were J A Arnott and J Inch Morrison. The building was listed on 28 March 1996. In 2012, the congregation bought the former St George's West Church of Scotland building in Shandwick Place for £1.55m. Senior pastor, Rev Paul Rees, said the Rose Street building was not fit for the congregation's needs while the Shandwick PLace building gave them a larger and more flexible space. In 2014, an application was made to convert the building to a ‘superpub’, but this was refused by City of Edinburgh Council. However, in 2016, a new application by Glendola Leisure Ltd, owners of Waxy O'Connors pub in Glasgow, to turn the building into a restaurant and apartment building was accepted. The ground floor was to be a 124 cover restaurant, while the basement was to have restaurant space for 64 and room for 48 standing at the bar. There were to be 22 serviced apartments in the space above, with two new floors created, including a guest lounge on the first floor. However, a different plan was eventually enacted, when a £1.8m development of a new theatre and performing arts centre by Danish ballet dancer and director Peter Schaufuss was accepted. The converted building features four performance spaces, including a 300 seat main hall, a basement space for 120, a 100 seat studio, and an attic with a capacity of 50. It opened at the 2017 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, programmed by Gilded Balloon who put on a mixed bill of 40 productions, including comedian Craig Ferguson. Shortly after that initial Fringe, Gilded Balloon announced a year round programme, including theatre in the main hall and comedy in the basement. Design The building is a four storey, five bay stripped Wrennaissance chapel and meeting halls, built of polished sandstone ashlar, with harled secondary elevations.

He served as resident in various countries and rose to First Deputy Head of the First Chief Directorate with the rank of General Lieutenant. Born in 1922, Kirpichenko initially trained to be a pilot, but with the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, he enlisted in the Red Army and served in Eastern and Central Europe during the closing stages of the war. Demobilised in 1946, he undertook studies at the Arab branch of the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, and was then recruited into intelligence work with the KGB's First Chief Directorate. He began his overseas postings with a period in Egypt as the KGB's deputy resident. This came during the early administration of Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Kirpichenko worked to gather information on its intentions. He passed information back to Moscow during the Suez Crisis in 1956, and worked to establish diplomatic relations with Yemen, before being recalled to the USSR in 1960. He returned to overseas postings in 1962 as resident in Tunisia, with a further period in the USSR between 1964 and 1970, serving as head of the African Department of the First Chief Directorate from 1967. Kirpichenko returned to Egypt in 1970 as resident, and served during the Yom Kippur War. He warned Moscow that Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was planning to reorient his foreign policy away from the Soviet Union and towards the USA. His predictions were unwelcome to the Soviet leadership, but were ultimately proved accurate. On Kirpichenko's return to the USSR in 1974 he was appointed deputy head of the First Chief Directorate and placed in charge of Department \\"S\\", , and in 1979 he became First Deputy Head of the First Chief Directorate, a post he would hold for the remainder of the existence of the Soviet Union. In late 1979 he was sent to Afghanistan to direct KGB operations surrounding Operation Storm-333, and the beginning of Soviet intervention in the country. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kirpichenko became head of a group of consultants under the director of one of the KGB's successors, the Foreign Intelligence Service. After retiring in 1997, he worked with others on a six-volume history of Russian intelligence, wrote two books of his own, and lectured widely on intelligence matters. Over the course of his career he received 54 awards from the Soviet, Russian and foreign governments. He died in 2005, survived by his wife, Valeriya Nikolaevna, an academic specialising in Arabic literature. Their son, Sergei Vadimovich, was a prominent diplomat in the Arab world, serving as ambassador to several Middle Eastern countries, including to Egypt, where his father had served as KGB resident for a number of years. Early life and wartime service Soviet troops approach Vienna during the closing stages of the war. Kirpichenko was involved in the Red Army's advances during 1945. Kirpichenko was born on 25 September 1922 in Kursk, Kursk Oblast, part of the Russian SFSR, in the USSR. He attended the No. 4 Air Force Special School, which provided primary flight training alongside the usual secondary education. He went on to attend the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy, but the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 interrupted his studies. He joined the 103rd Guards Rifle Division in January 1945, seeing action in the closing stages of the war, in Hungary, Austria and Czechoslovakia, and at the Balaton Defensive Operation in March that year. During his wartime service he was awarded the Medal \\"For Courage\\", for his part in the Vienna Offensive. His unit remained in action until the surrender of Axis forces in Czechoslovakia on 12 May 1945. Intelligence training Kirpichenko left the army at the end of 1946 with the rank of senior sergeant, and enrolled in the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, where he studied in the Arab branch. He graduated as the highest scoring student, and had been secretary of the Institute's party committee. He was then offered the chance to become an intelligence officer. He enrolled in Intelligence School No. 101 on 1 September 1952, where he learned the basics of the intelligence profession, alongside Arabic and French. With the completion of his studies in July 1953, he joined the Eastern Department of the KGB's First Chief Directorate, which was responsible for foreign operations and intelligence activities. He was assigned the code name \\"Vadimov\\". Overseas postings Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Kirpichenko was tasked on gathering information about his government's intentions. His first overseas posting was to Egypt in December 1954 as the KGB's deputy resident, where he was based until 1960. On his arrival in Egypt he found that he was not familiar with the local dialect, and spent the next one and a half years in intensive language study alongside his intelligence duties. His arrival coincided with the early period of Gamal Abdel Nasser's rule, with the Soviet authorities particularly concerned about the new government's stance towards the Western powers, and its intentions in the Arab world. Kirpichenko worked to develop intelligence sources and pass information back to the Soviet Union. When Dmitri Shepilov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, visited Egypt in May 1956, it was Kirpichenko who arranged a meeting between Nasser and Shepilov, using his contacts in Nasser's powerbase, the Free Officers Movement. During the Suez Crisis in October and November 1956, Kirpichenko remained in Cairo and continued to gather intelligence. Despite Western opinion that the Soviet Union was behind Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal, Kirpichenko noted that \\"we did not have any specific information about Nasser's intentions, but we always indicated in our reports that such a step was possible at any moment\\". Despite not having informed Moscow of their intentions, Kirpichenko reported that the general feeling among Egyptians was that the Soviet Union should come to their aid once fighting began. \\"The first days passed and our situation became grim. Agitated Egyptians, waving their fists, cried \\"Russians, where are you! Where are your airplanes? Where are your weapons? Where are your soldiers? Why isn't Russia saving Egypt?\\" I didn't understand these demands back then, but later on, after experiencing two further wars in Egypt, I stopped being amazed at these outcries.\\" In December 1958 he accompanied Nasser on his visit to the Soviet Union, and acted as a translator during Nasser's meetings with Nikita Khrushchev. Kirpichenko was also one of the diplomats involved in the establishment of diplomatic relations with Yemen. He did this by cultivating a friendship with Crown Prince Muhammad al- Badr, that was close enough that the Prince reportedly refused to visit London in 1957 without Kirpichenko at his side. Kirpichenko returned to the Soviet Union in 1960 and spent two years working with the KGB's central organisation, before moving to Tunisia as resident in February 1962. Here he was tasked with maintaining contacts with the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, the political arm of the National Liberation Front during the Algerian War. This posting lasted until August 1964. Anwar Sadat, president during Kirpichenko's period as head of the residency in Egypt. Kirpichenko warned that Sadat was preparing to break with the Soviet Union in favour of closeness to the USA. Returning once more to the Soviet Union, he spent between 1964 and 1967 with the central organisation. In 1967 he was appointed head of the African Department of the First Chief Directorate, holding this position until 1970. During this time he made visits to Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Angola, Libya, Algeria and Tunisia. Kirpichenko returned to Egypt in 1970, becoming foreign intelligence resident there until 1974. He was in post during the Yom Kippur War between Egypt and Israel in 1973, and subsequently warned Soviet leaders that Egyptian president Anwar Sadat was planning to reorient Egyptian foreign policy away from the Soviet Union and towards the United States, having learnt that Sadat had been in secret communication with US President Richard Nixon. This view was at odds with the general opinion of Soviet leaders, who considered Sadat a loyal friend of the Soviet Union, and successor to Nasser's political legacy. Subsequent developments were to vindicate Kirpichenko. As with the Suez Crisis, there were suspicions in Western capitals that the Soviet Union was behind Egypt's actions. Kirpichenko instead argued that the Soviet Union had tried to prevent an Egyptian offensive that risked destabilising the region. He was promoted to Major General in 1973, and to General Lieutenant in 1980. His good service brought him to the attention of Yuri Andropov, chairman of the KGB, and in 1974 he was appointed deputy head of the First Chief Directorate and led Department \\"S\\", , where he spent the next five years. In 1979 Kirpichenko became First Deputy Head of the First Chief Directorate, and would hold this position until 1991. Afghanistan Soviet troops in the aftermath of Operation Storm-333 On 4 December 1979 Kirpichenko arrived in Kabul, in Afghanistan, with a group of officers of the Soviet Airborne Forces, having been sent by KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov to plan for the removal of Hafizullah Amin, the sitting Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council of Afghanistan. He took charge of the intelligence officials in the country in preparation for Operation Storm-333, the ousting of Amin and the installation of Babrak Karmal as Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council. At a meeting at Kabul airport on 26 December 1979 Kirpichenko oversaw the inclusion of KGB reconnaissance and sabotage units with the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, with orders to direct elements of the division to key Afghan institutions, which were to be secured for the new government. The planning for the operation took place in great secrecy, with even the newly appointed Soviet ambassador, , unaware of the operation until after it had begun. Tabeyev telephoned Kirpichenko asking for explanations, but Kirpichenko replied that he was too busy at the time, but promised to report in the morning. Late and Post-Soviet period From 1 October 1988 to 6 February 1989 Kirpichenko served as chief of foreign intelligence. In June 1991 Kirpichenko warned against the effects of Glasnost, which he claimed were making it easier for foreign intelligence agents to work successfully in the USSR. In 1991, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and subsequent restructuring of the intelligence services, Kirpichenko was appointed head of a group of consultants under the director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. He retired from this in 1997, and began working with a number of authors as assistant editor-in-chief to compile a six-volume Essays on the History of Russian Intelligence. He lectured widely on this topic, in the US, UK, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Malta, South Korea and France, and attended numerous international conferences and seminars on the history of intelligence. He published two books; From the Intelligence Archives (, Iz arkhiva razvedchika) and Intelligence: People and Personalities (, Razvedka: litsa i lichnosti), and numerous articles and essays on intelligence matters. He was an honorary professor of the Academy of Foreign Intelligence. Awards and honours Over his career Kirpichenko received many awards and decorations. He held eight Soviet and Russian orders, including the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\" Fourth Class, the Orders of Lenin, October Revolution, Red Star, Patriotic War First Class, and the Badge of Honour. He was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He received the badges \\"Honorary State Security Officer\\" and \\"For Service in Intelligence\\", and had received honours from eight foreign governments, including Vietnam, Peru, Mongolia, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the German Democratic Republic and Afghanistan. He was awarded the in the field of literature and art. He was also an Honorary Citizen of Kursk. In total he had 54 awards. Family and death Kirpichenko died on 3 December 2005. His wife, Valeriya Nikolaevna, was a philologist and specialist in Arabic literature with the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences. She outlived him, dying in 2015. Their son, Sergei Vadimovich, was born in 1951, and like his parents specialised in Middle Eastern affairs. He became a diplomat, and served as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Syria and Egypt.

Early life and education  Born in Apollo, Pennsylvania, on May 22 1930, Grubbs primarily grew up on a rural farm with his siblings attending a schoolhouse with only one room. After the family relocated to Erie, Pennsylvania, in the early 1940s, he attended Strong Vincent High School in Erie, where he earned a varsity letter in baseball, and received his high school diploma in 1948. Shortly after graduating from high school, Grubbs and his brother Bill enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where they served honorably for four years. While employed at Raytheon, Grubbs furthered his education by attending the business school at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.  Career  After his Honorable Discharge from the US Navy in 1952, Grubbs settled with his wife in Massachusetts. By 1953 he had landed an entry-level position at Raytheon Company, working on the Hawk Missile Systems assembly line, and soon thereafter was promoted to supervisor. He eventually attained an important and highly responsible management position in the mid-60s, becoming the Missile Systems Quality Control Manager, overseeing as many as 3,000 employees. From the mid 1960s to the late 1970s, Grubbs was largely responsible for and instrumental in Raytheon's development of the Air Defense System of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 1967, Grubbs and his family moved to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia at Raytheon's complex. As a friend of the royal Saudi family, Grubbs was able to negotiate and secure billions of dollars in Hawk Missile Systems contracts; including installation and maintenance services of these missile systems, and formal education of many thousands of native Saudis to operate the defense system. In addition, his close relationships with members of the royal family enabled him to serve the kingdom and the royal family in several other capacities for Whittaker Corporation, Litton Corporation, and Orion Corporation well into the 1990s. In early 1972, Grubbs and his team of Raytheon contract specialists in Jeddah were engaged in advanced discussions with Prince Sultan and Prince Khalid bin Sultan on price and availability of the new munitions. By late 1972, Grubbs informed the Raytheon Executives that the next Improved Hawk Missile contract would probably involve somewhere between $400 million and $800 million in purchases by Saudi Arabia directly from Raytheon. The Grubbs's work contributed to the exponential growth of Raytheon from a fledgling diode and defense electronics company into one of the largest guided missiles manufacturer in the world.  Personal life  Grubbs married twice. While in the U.S Navy, stationed in Boston, he met Jean Louise Honnors, a student at Dean Junior College. They married in 1952 and went on to have 8 children between the years of 1952 and 1965. They divorced in 1969. Grubbs subsequently married Claire Corriveau in 1970, an executive secretary at Raytheon, and soon thereafter adopted her only son Robert, who was a hemophiliac.

Development of the film, known then as Jurassic Park IV, began in 2001. William Monahan was announced as screenwriter in 2002, and the film was scheduled for a 2005 release. When Monahan left to work on another project, he was replaced in 2004 by John Sayles. By 2005, the start of production had stalled, as executive producer Steven Spielberg was not satisfied with any of the script drafts. In 2006, Jurassic Park III director Joe Johnston was set to direct the film, which was subsequently expected for release in 2008. By 2010, filming had yet to begin. Johnston and Spielberg intended to work on the film following the completion of their own respective film projects. Writer Mark Protosevich was hired in 2011, although two story treatments by him were rejected. After a final story idea was chosen, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver were hired in 2012 to write a draft of Jurassic Park IV that would incorporate ideas from Spielberg. Colin Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, and the film was delayed once more to give Trevorrow and his writing partner Derek Connolly more time to perfect the script by Jaffa and Silver. Spielberg approved the script in September 2013, and a name change to Jurassic World was announced that month. Filming occurred from April 10 to August 5, 2014, with shooting in Hawaii and Louisiana. Jurassic World was completed on May 10, 2015, and was theatrically released the following month. Development Steven Spielberg was the film's executive producer William Monahan wrote the film's first draft In March 2001, Jurassic Park III director Joe Johnston said he and executive producer Steven Spielberg had discussed a story idea for a fourth Jurassic Park film, which Johnston was not interested in directing. In May 2001, Spielberg had Amblin Entertainment commence development of ideas for Jurassic Park IV, which he planned to produce. Late in Jurassic Park IIIs production, Spielberg devised a story idea he believed should have been used for the third film. In June 2001, Johnston announced he would not direct the film and that Spielberg had a story idea that would extend the Jurassic Park series' mythology. Johnston said the film would feel like a departure from the previous films, implying it would not be set on an island. Johnston also said it would not involve the Pteranodons from the ending of Jurassic Park III, then later hinted it would. Actor Sam Neill, who portrayed Dr. Alan Grant in two previous films in the series, said he could not imagine a way for his character to be involved in another film. Neill was contracted for three films; other actors from Jurassic Park III were also contracted for a potential fourth film. In April 2002, it was reported that the fourth Jurassic Park film would be the last in the series and that it would ignore events portrayed in its predecessor. In June 2002, Spielberg confirmed plans for a fourth film, which he hoped Johnston would direct. Spielberg also said he considered the film's story idea the best one since the first film. By October 2002, Neill was being considered for a possible role in the film. The following month, William Monahan was announced as the screenwriter, with Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy as producers. Universal Pictures would be involved in the film's production. The film was scheduled for a mid-2005 release. In January 2003, Jeff Goldblum said he had been asked to stay available for a possible return of his character Dr. Ian Malcolm. At the end of the month, it was reported the story would partially involve dinosaurs migrating to the Costa Rican mainland. A team of experts, including Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, would chart an expedition to an offshore island and discover the dinosaurs breeding freely. Part of the plot would involve the characters devising a way to restrict the spread of the dinosaurs and prevent an ecological disaster. Early concept art also depicted genetically engineered human-dinosaur mercenaries. Stan Winston's special effects studio, which worked on the previous films, was in the design phase for the film as of April 2003. Winston intended for the special effects to be more advanced than in the previous films, for instance by creating animatronics of Velociraptors with internal motors, providing better control and movement. Winston said Spielberg wanted to adapt several unfilmed scenes from Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel and its sequel The Lost World. By July 2003, Keira Knightley was in consideration for two roles, including a small role as a granddaughter.Knightly in Boxoffice via Monahan's first draft of the script was finished later that month; the story was not set in a jungle, as in previous films. Neill confirmed he would reprise his character; filming was set to begin in 2004 in California and Hawaii. In September 2003, Richard Attenborough said he would reprise his role as John Hammond. The following month, paleontologist Jack Horner said he would return as technical adviser for the fourth film, hinting it would feature a Velociraptor. He was later asked about a hypothetical idea of humans evolving from dinosaurs rather than mammals; Horner responded, \\"Keep thinking about that, and in a couple of years go see Jurassic Park 4\\". Knightley's character was written out in late 2003. [quote from Cinemania] In March 2004, Johnston said he had not been asked to direct the film and hoped Spielberg would direct it. Johnston said a story that would take the series in a completely different direction \\"away from the island and away from the T. rex and all this\\" was being written. In April 2004, script doctors were being sought to work on the film's story, which involved dinosaurs being trained by the government to carry and use weapons in battles. John Sayles wrote two drafts of the script in 2004. As of May 2004, screenwriter John Sayles was writing the script, after being hired to finish earlier work done by Monahan, who had left the project to work on Kingdom of Heaven. Sayles wrote two drafts for the film. In his first draft, Isla Nublar and InGen have been taken over by Grendel Corporation, a Swiss holdings company, while creatures from the island have begun attacking people on the mainland of Central and North America. The script featured a brief return to Isla Nublar and would focus on a mercenary named Nick Harris, a new character who is sent by John Hammond to the island to retrieve a canister of dinosaur DNA that was lost during the events of the first film. With the DNA, Hammond intends to have his scientists create a new group of infertile dinosaurs that can kill the extant ones. Harris retrieves the canister but is kidnapped and taken to Grendel Corporation's headquarters in the Swiss Alps, where he is persuaded into helping the company train a team of genetically modified Deinonychus and two Dilophosaurus for use on rescue missions and to combat drug dealers. The dinosaurs would be equipped with body armor and would use their teeth and claws as weapons. The Deinonychus would be hybrids, containing human DNA for intelligence and dog DNA for obedience. The script focused mostly on the efforts of Harris and a team of experts as they train the dinosaurs. Hammond would be the only returning character in this draft. The concept of a human who trains raptors came from Spielberg. Frank Marshall produced the film By June 2004, Frank Marshall had joined the project as a producer, while Alex Proyas was in discussions to direct, with filming expected to begin in March 2005 for a late-2005 release. Filming would begin at Pinewood Studios, where a massive tank was to be constructed for scenes involving marine reptiles. In July 2004, the script was being rewritten and Jeremy Piven and Emmy Rossum were being considered for two of the lead roles. Glen Powell auditioned for a role as well, and Attenborough was to reprise his character. Later in July 2004, Proyas said he was not interested in directing the film. In August 2004, Drew McWeeny of Ain't It Cool News published a review of Sayles's initial draft, calling it \\"well-written and inventive\\" but \\"bugfuck crazy\\". Sayles later confirmed this was an early draft of the script that had been intercepted through Spielberg's email by a hacker. In late August 2004, David Boreanaz was rumored and later reported to have the lead role, although he was actually in consideration for Fantastic Four. Sayles was still rewriting the script in September 2004, with the film on track for a late-2005 release. =Stalled progress= In April 2005, Winston confirmed the film was on hold because of repeated revisions to the film's script, none of which satisfied Spielberg. According to Winston, \\"He felt neither of [the drafts] balanced the science and adventure elements effectively ... too much science will make the movie too talky, but too much adventure will make it seem hollow\\". Progress on the film stalled during 2005 as Marshall and Spielberg were busy with other film projects. At the end of the year, Spielberg said he planned to include a scene inspired by Crichton's novel The Lost World that would involve characters on motorcycles as they flee from raptors. In January 2006, Johnston and Horner were working on a new screenplay, with further work expected to begin following the completion of a fourth Indiana Jones film that Spielberg and Marshall were working on. In February 2006, Marshall said the film now had a good script, with filming expected to begin in 2007 for a 2008 release. In March 2006, Marshall said the film had a script and was getting a director; Johnston was a possible candidate. In April 2006, Marshall said there was an idea for the film but no script. Marshall said Crichton would not write the script and that Spielberg would not direct it. The script was still being worked on in June 2006. The following month, Spielberg denied an Internet rumor that Breck Eisner would direct, saying Johnston was standing by for the job.Spielberg in In December 2006, Laura Dern said she was open to reprising her role as Ellie Sattler but had not been contacted about appearing in the film. In March 2007, Neill said he knew nothing about the project. By April 2007, Dern had been contacted about appearing in the film, with filming expected to begin that year for release in 2008. By that time, Johnston no longer planned to direct the film. In December 2007, Marshall said further work on the script would begin at the end of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, with filming potentially starting in 2008 for a release in mid-2009. Horner's 2009 book, How to Build a Dinosaur, was originally planned for release at the same time as the film as a scientific companion volume. During 2008, Attenborough and Goldblum expressed interest in reprising their roles, although Attenborough suffered a fall at his home later that year and subsequently retired from acting. In a 2008 interview, Johnston discussed the possibility of Jurassic Park IV, stating that the film's story was completely different from that of its predecessors and would not be set on an island. Johnston also said the film would take the franchise into a new trilogy. Interview conducted approximately two months (circa September 2008) before Johnston signed on to direct Captain America: The First Avenger (November 2008). In December 2008, a month after Crichton's death, Kennedy said, \\"I sorta felt maybe that's it. Maybe that's a sign that we don't mess with it.\\" In June 2009, Marshall said the film was a long shot and that it did not have a story. In early 2010, Johnston said Jurassic Park IV would essentially be the beginning of a second Jurassic Park trilogy. Johnston also said the film would feature new characters and a story that did not involve a dinosaur theme park, and would not use the story from Sayles's initial 2004 draft. Johnston hoped to further develop the project with Spielberg after they finished other projects, including Johnston's 2011 film, Captain America: The First Avenger. In 2011, Iain McCaig presented a pitch trailer titled Jurassic World to Spielberg. The trailer depicted loose pterosaurs attacking a surfer. The trailer, part of a multi-media attempt to revive the franchise, was rejected. By June 15, 2011, Spielberg had met twice with writer Mark Protosevich to work on a story for a potential fourth Jurassic Park film. In July 2011, Johnston said he was in discussions about the fourth film, which was still planned as the start of a new trilogy. Later that month at the San Diego Comic-Con International, Spielberg said a writer was working on a treatment for the film, which he said might be released \\"within the next two or three years\\". A representative of Universal said 2013 would be the preferred deadline for completion. Spielberg initially felt that the film's planned story was stronger than that of Jurassic Park III. Protosevich wrote two story treatments for the film, but neither were accepted. At the time, Spielberg and Kennedy felt that the film did not have an adequate story. Story ideas were still being discussed toward the end of 2011. In January 2012, Spielberg said he would not direct the film but would produce it. In June 2012, it was announced that writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver would be scripting Jurassic Park 4. Pre-production On January 11, 2013, Universal said the film would be made in 3D and released on June 13, 2014. In February, it was reported that Kennedy would not be producing the film in favor of focusing on the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Marshall remained as a producer. Shortly after, the director of studio operations at Raleigh Studios in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, confirmed that Universal Pictures had reserved space there from April to November 2013, without specifying the reason. Colin Trevorrow directed the film Brad Bird had wanted to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and he suggested to Kennedy that she temporarily employ Colin Trevorrow as a stand-in for him during the film's pre-production. Under this proposal, Bird would take over the Star Wars project upon completion of his film Tomorrowland. Bird's idea prompted Kennedy and her husband, Marshall, to watch Trevorrow's 2012 film Safety Not Guaranteed, which they found impressive. Marshall subsequently had Spielberg watch the film, convincing him that Trevorrow could be an adequate choice to direct Jurassic Park IV. At the end of February 2013, Marshall arranged a meeting between himself, Trevorrow and Spielberg. Marshall said he and Spielberg realized that Trevorrow \\"was deeply steeped in Jurassic Park and would bring that sense of childlike wonder to the film.\\" Trevorrow was subsequently hired without reading Jaffa and Silver's script, which was still being written.Colin Trevorrow Interview: Jurassic World, Jaws and More , Den of Geek On March 14, 2013, Universal announced Trevorrow as director, and Patrick Crowley as a producer. A year had been spent searching for a director. Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy had previously considered Juan Antonio Bayona to direct Jurassic World, but he declined because he felt there was not enough time for production. Trevorrow's only prior experience in directing a major film project was the low-budget Safety Not Guaranteed. Despite Trevorrow's lack of experience on such a large film project, Crowley said \\"from the beginning he exhibited real characteristics of leadership and had that inherent decisiveness required. His comments and observations were wise, certainly far beyond his experience and years, and it was clear early on that he had what it takes.\\" In April 2013, Jack Horner said a new, previously extinct creature would rise to stardom in the film. After reading Jaffa and Silver's draft, Trevorrow insisted on completely rewriting the script with writing partner Derek Connolly, who had never seen any of the Jurassic Park films prior to that point. Trevorrow had told the filmmakers, \\"if I direct this screenplay, it's going to be a bad movie. I'm gonna do a bad job, because I just don't get it.\\" Trevorrow and Connolly wrote their own draft of the script over a couple of weeks. The studio received the draft on May 6, 2013, and found the script changes more large-scale than anticipated. On May 8, 2013, the studio announced it was pushing the release from June 13, 2014, to an unspecified future date. Filming had been set to begin on June 24, 2013. Delaying the film allowed Trevorrow and Connolly more time to work on the script, as Spielberg felt that it needed improvement. Another reason for the delay was to allow time for the construction of practical sets for the fictional theme park; it was previously intended to add in these buildings using computer effects. In May 2013, Trevorrow tweeted a picture of Kauai taken during location scouting with the caption \\"Nublar\\", the name of the island in the original film. Later that month, Sam Neill said it was unlikely he would be a part of the film, stating, \\"I'm told it's a big reboot, a total re-jig.\\" Trevorrow eventually tweeted that \\"Reboot is a strong word. This is a new sci-fi terror adventure set 22 years after the horrific events of Jurassic Park.\\" In June 2013, a new release date of 2015 was announced, and it was reported that the film would revolve around a fully functional dinosaur theme park. In August 2013, Legendary Pictures was considering co-financing the film with Universal. On September 10, 2013, Universal Pictures announced that the film would be titled Jurassic World and would be released on June 12, 2015. Trevorrow chose to rename the film from its previous title, Jurassic Park IV, to differentiate it from previous films in the series. Trevorrow also said that within the story, \\"if you named a theme park 'Jurassic Park' after the disaster that had happened it would be a horrible PR mistake.\\" New Orleans was announced as a filming location in February 2014. By that time, Legendary Pictures had agreed to co-finance the film, and provided about 20% of the budget. China Film Group has been reported as also having financed the film. Thomas Tull of Legendary Pictures served as executive producer for the film with Spielberg. =Writing= Spielberg had three ideas he wanted Jaffa and Silver to incorporate into the script; a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, a human who has a relationship with trained raptors (from Sayles's earlier draft), and a human-eating dinosaur that escapes and has to be stopped. Spielberg also wanted the story to involve children. Jaffa and Silver's draft, titled Jurassic Park IV, included an early scene set in China, where the fossilized remains of a new dinosaur species are discovered by a Chinese paleontologist. In the draft, the remains are stolen by a corporation with malicious intentions, leading the paleontologist and her two sons to visit Jurassic Park. Jaffa and Silver worked on the script for approximately a year, with input from Spielberg. The script also included an opening scene with the dinosaur handler and his raptor pack jumping out of a helicopter to perform a military raid of a drug dealer's compound, an idea that was present in Sayles' earlier draft. Trevorrow and Connolly After the film was delayed in May 2013, Trevorrow and Connolly continued rewriting the script and worked with Spielberg to perfect it. Throughout the writing period, Trevorrow, Connolly and Spielberg discussed in meetings the film's story. David Koepp also met with Trevorrow and Connolly to advise them on the script. Koepp wrote the first two films in the series; he declined an offer to write the fourth film because he felt he had nothing left to contribute to the series. Trevorrow said perfecting the script was the hardest part because Jurassic Park films \\"don't fit into a specific genre. They're sci-fi adventures that also have to be funny, emotional and scary as hell. That takes a lot of construction, but it can't feel designed.\\" To write the film's story, Trevorrow and Connolly discussed major news events that occurred in the past twenty years. Trevorrow said two main ideas emerged; the ill-advised pursuit of money leading to environmental disaster and the ubiquity of technology leading to ignorance and the taking for granted of scientific wonders. According to Trevorrow; \\"[w]e take so much for granted … we imagined a teenager texting his girlfriend with his back to a T-Rex behind protective glass. For us, that image captured the way much of the audience feels about the movies themselves. 'We've seen CG dinosaurs. What else you got?'\\" The film features a large amount of product placement, including Samsung and Mercedes- Benz. Trevorrow said this was inspired by a quotation from Ian Malcolm in the first film; \\"You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you wanna sell it.\\" Trevorrow also viewed Jurassic World as a story about film sequels, explaining, \\"Why would you make another sequel to one of these movies? It's a horrible mistake. Well, because there's a lot of money on the table. Why would you rebuild a park? We re-make our mistakes because somebody somewhere is going to make a lot of money.\\" Trevorrow believed that Crichton would have appreciated the film's thematic perspective on corporations. Trevorrow and Connolly retained Spielberg's three ideas, although Trevorrow felt the concept of trained raptors was, in its original form, too extreme and had to be \\"pulled way, way, way back\\". A few months after being hired, Trevorrow read through each of the previous drafts for the film. Trevorrow said each previous draft \\"tried to do something different\\" from the earlier films in the series. Trevorrow called Sayles's initial draft \\"fascinating in a lot of ways. There were a lot of things I loved about it. It was properly bonkers. In a way, I aspired for our film, in its fearlessness and willingness, to go there\\". Trevorrow further stated that he was \\"interested in what the Sayles script was trying to do because it was so daring. It was trying to set a tone for how far forward we needed to push\\". However, he felt that each of the previous scripts \\"took us too far forward with man's progressions with dinosaurs.\\" Owen's relationship with raptors was inspired by real-life relationships between humans and dangerous animals such as lions and alligators. In their first appearance in the film, the raptors are ordered not to eat a live pig in their enclosure; Trevorrow said that this \\"was as far as we should be able to go\\" with the concept of trained raptors. Trevorrow and Connolly did not want to include previous characters in the new film without a good reason for their return to the series; they considered Dr. Henry Wu, the scientist responsible for recreating dinosaurs, a logical choice. In the first novel, Henry Wu had a much larger role, which was trimmed down for the film adaptation. Trevorrow said that the characters Alan Grant, Ian Malcolm, and Ellie Sattler were not included in the script because \\"I respect those actors too much to shoehorn them into this story for my own sentimental reasons. Jurassic Park isn't about the bad luck of three people who keep getting thrown into the same situation. The only reason they'd go back to that island is if the screenwriters contrived a reason for them to go.\\" Trevorrow said viewers could feel nostalgia without having an actor reprise a role after so many years, which he believed \\"might make you feel old and remind you that you're on a slow march towards death, like the rest of us!\\" According to Trevorrow, the film \\"isn't a sequel or a reboot or a remake, it's all of those things in a strange way\\". He did not wish to make a \\"carbon copy of Jurassic Park\\". Jurassic World features various references to Jurassic Park, and is considered a direct sequel to the first film; Trevorrow stated that the events of the previous two films were not relevant to the new film's story because they take place on a different island. He also said the events depicted in the film's predecessors are still canon in the film series. Rewrite Trevorrow's and Connolly's rewrite of the Jaffa/Silver script introduced various changes, including new characters. Trevorrow wrote the characters Hoskins, Masrani, and Wu while Connolly wrote the children and female characters. In Jaffa and Silver's draft, the main character, who would become Owen, actively supported the militarization of the raptors from the beginning of the story. Trevorrow said \\"if anyone's gonna militarize raptors that's what the bad guy does, he's insane\\". Characters in the Jaffa/Silver draft included Vance and Whitney, who would later become Owen and Claire in the Trevorrow/Connolly revision. Whitney would serve as an obstacle to Vance's plans, and would have a smaller role than that of Claire. Trevorrow felt that Whitney was the one character in the earlier script who \\"had the most room to grow\\". Trevorrow chose the name \\"Claire\\", describing it as \\"hard on the surface but ultimately warm and loving,\\" while Connolly chose the surname \\"Dearing\\". According to Trevorrow, Connolly \\"loves those Dickensian names that suggest a bit about the character, push the viewer in the direction the author wants them to go. She may seem sharp-edged at first, but ultimately she's very endearing.\\" Trevorrow's and Connolly's script redraft also changed the story so viewers would first see the theme park from the perspective of a child. Trevorrow said one of his goals was for the child characters of Zach and Gray to \\"not be annoying. And I think we pulled it off.\\" Gray was initially written as a child with autism, a trait that was removed from the final draft. Initially, the film's new dinosaur was known as Malusaurus. In Jaffa's and Silver's draft, the new dinosaur—a non-existent species—was depicted as a real animal. Trevorrow made the dinosaur a genetically modified hybrid named Indominus rex to maintain consistency with earlier films in the series, which had incorporated the latest paleontological discoveries; he said, \\"I didn't wanna make up a new dinosaur and tell kids it was real\\". Trevorrow said that the behavior of the Indominus rex was somewhat inspired by the 2013 film Blackfish, saying the dinosaur \\"is kind of out killing for sport because it grew up in captivity. It's sort of, like, if the black fish orca got loose and never knew its mother and has been fed from a crane.\\" Trevorrow said the idea of a hybrid dinosaur was \\"not tremendously different from [those in] the first film, by adding frog DNA. It's the next level.\\" In addition to the Indominus rex, the earlier draft by Trevorrow and Connolly also included a second hybrid dinosaur named Stegoceratops, which is bred using DNA from Stegosaurus and Triceratops. Trevorrow removed the animal from the final script after his son persuaded him that featuring multiple hybrids would not make the Indominus unique. Hybrid dinosaurs were previously introduced to the franchise through Jurassic Park: Chaos Effect, an unsuccessful toy line released by Kenner in 1998. Trevorrow and Connolly shortened the raptor hunt for the park's new, escaped dinosaur, which in the Jaffa/Silver draft occupied the second half of the film. One scene, which was inspired by Crichton's novel The Lost World, involves Owen riding a motorcycle while his raptors race alongside him during their search for the Indominus. Spielberg had intended to include the scene as early as 2005, although his initial vision for the scene involved humans on motorcycles fleeing from raptors rather than cooperating with them. The Indominus camouflage ability is also present in The Lost World, which features Carnotaurus with the same ability. Trevorrow suggested the idea of including a Mosasaurus as part of a theme-park feeding show in which park-goers would watch from bleachers as the animal leaps out of a lagoon and catches its prey: a shark hanging above the water. Spielberg suggested lowering the bleachers afterwards to give park guests a view of the creature in its aquatic habitat. The theme park's ball-shaped gyrosphere rides were another of Spielberg's ideas; he approved Trevorrow's and Connolly's draft in September 2013. =Casting= Prior to the production delay in May 2013, actors Bryce Dallas Howard, David Oyelowo and Garrett Hedlund had been considered for roles in the film. By August 15, 2013, John Krasinski was in talks for a role as a dinosaur tamer. In September 2013, Howard was in early negotiations for a role and was cast by early November. By mid-October, Ty Simpkins had been cast as the child lead, while Nick Robinson was cast as the older brother of Simpkins's character. Trevorrow wanted to cast Robinson after seeing his performance in The Kings of Summer. Robinson and Simpkins had to perform a \\"scream test\\" before being cast. During mid-October, Jake Johnson was being considered for a role while Josh Brolin was reportedly in talks to play Owen. Brolin was an early candidate in consideration but ultimately did not receive an offer for the role. By mid-November 2013, Brolin was no longer in consideration for the film and Chris Pratt was in negotiations for the role of Owen. By mid-January 2014, Pratt had been cast in the role. Trevorrow had been impressed by Pratt's acting in Zero Dark Thirty. In 2010, Pratt had joked that Spielberg had cast him in the film. Trevorrow said that when Pratt was cast, \\"we had no idea he'd become as big a star as he has. I just cast a bunch of character actors, as all Jurassic Park movies have. And somehow we ended up with a movie star.\\" Trevorrow considered Owen to be a combination of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm. Pratt said about the character; \\"He's got a little bit of the Goldblum cynicism but also the Sam Neill excitement at the wonder of the biology of it all, so it's a combination\\". Although Pratt received top billing in the cast, Trevorrow stated that Howard's character Claire is the lead character. Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy were cast in early 2014. Trevorrow had admired Sy's acting and wrote the character of Barry with him in mind for the role. Trevorrow also said he cast actors such as Sy because they were well- known internationally, stating that \\"this is a global film and Jurassic Park doesn't belong to just America\\". In March 2014, Johnson confirmed he would have a role in the film. Johnson previously starred in Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed. The same month, Trevorrow announced BD Wong would reprise his role as Dr. Henry Wu, stating that the character would have a more significant role than he did in the original film. A week before filming began, it was announced that Judy Greer, Katie McGrath and Lauren Lapkus had joined the cast. Over the next two months, it was announced Andy Buckley and James DuMont had joined the cast. Filming Principal photography began on April 10, 2014, at Hawaii's Honolulu Zoo. The film was made under the working title Ebb Tide, which Spielberg chose before Trevorrow was hired. Spielberg did not visit the set, although he watched daily film footage at the end of each production day and sometimes advised Trevorrow on the filming of certain scenes. In contrast to the prevalence of digital cinematography in the 2010s, cinematographer John Schwartzman used Panavision cameras with a combination of Kodak 35mm and 65mm film stocks. One of the 65mm cameras used on the production was used in the filming of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The reason the filmmakers chose to shoot Jurassic World on film stock, in addition to Spielberg's and Schwartzman's personal preference for the format, was to match the visual aesthetic of the previous three film-shot Jurassic Park pictures, and because the film's exterior jungle scenes required a greater dynamic range of light than digital cameras could accommodate. Most of Jurassic World was made on 35mm film and large exteriors in Hawaii were shot using 65mm film, which was used for visual effect sequences and as location shots where the filmmakers wanted extra visual impact. The film is presented in a Univisium 2.00:1 aspect ratio, an intermediate ratio that falls between the two industry standard aspect ratios of 1.85:1 (flat) and 2.39:1 (scope). This was chosen because it allowed enough height for humans and dinosaurs to fit into the same frame without giving up a sense of scope, and closely matches the ratio of digital IMAX screens. Schwartzman made extensive use of the Technocrane telescopic crane, which Crowley described as fitting for a thriller, \\"being able to march into people, to get in closer and closer, as they realize that there's something out there\\". Tracking shots, particularly those that would serve as reference to the visual effects team, used a Spydercam.Patrick Crowley – Jurassic World , ICG Magazine Scroggins Aviation Mockup & Effects was hired to fabricate and build the Blue Eurocopter EC130 T2 airframe body known as \\"JW001\\" in the film,Cinefex issue 142 page 90 and 95 (2015) while 32TEN Studios created the automatic Jurassic World gates and various practical effects such as explosions. During filming, Trevorrow confirmed reports that the story involved a functioning dinosaur theme park and a hybrid dinosaur; he was disappointed these details could not be kept secret until the film's release. During filming, the Indominus rex was also known as Diabolus rex, a name Trevorrow devised to maintain secrecy on the project. =Hawaii= Interior scenes were shot at the Hawaii Convention Center. Filming lasted four weeks on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. An elephant paddock at the Honolulu Zoo was used to portray Jurassic World's petting zoo. Howard's son portrayed one of the children seen in the zoo. Filming in Hawaii was limited to three hours on some days because of torrential rain. The -high Indominus paddock and the Gyrosphere departure platform were built at Oahu's Kualoa Ranch; both sets were left standing after production to become tourist attractions. A Triumph Scrambler was used as Owen's motorcycle. Three of the motorcycles were made for the film production. Owen's motorcycle sequence with the raptors was filmed along a dirt road at Kualoa Ranch; computer-generated jungle foliage was added during post-production. Pratt crashed his motorcycle during filming, resulting in minor injuries. A scene involving a mountainside helipad was also shot at Kualoa Ranch, as was a scene set outside Owen's camper trailer. At the end of April 2014, interior scenes were filmed at the Hawaii Convention Center. The film's ending, in which park guests are evacuated to an airplane hangar set up as a shelter, was filmed at the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor on Ford Island. A Honolulu ferry, the Navatek I, was used to portray a Jurassic World ferry for theme park guests. Filming moved to Kauai on May 15, 2014, and concluded there on June 6, 2014. The Hawaii shoot lasted a total of 33 days. =Louisiana= Jurassic World was also shot in Louisiana to take advantage of the state's tax incentives, making it the first film in the series not to be shot at studios in Los Angeles. Filming was scheduled to remain in Louisiana for eleven weeks beginning in June 2014 at New Orleans's abandoned Six Flags New Orleans theme park, and continuing there for approximately two weeks. Jurassic World's Main Street and boardwalk, measuring , was constructed in Six Flags New Orleans' parking lot, but the theme park itself was not used for filming, as it was too badly damaged from Hurricane Katrina. While filming was underway in Hawaii, a crew of approximately 400 people worked to construct the boardwalk set. Approximately 800 extras were used to populate the Main Street set during filming. One of Main Street's restaurants is named Winston's after Stan Winston, who died in 2008. A statue of Attenborough's character John Hammond is also seen in the film. Although Goldblum did not reprise his role as Ian Malcolm, the character is twice shown in an image on a fictional book written by the character. Singer Jimmy Buffett, a friend of Marshall, has a brief, non-speaking cameo appearance during the film's pterosaur attack sequence. A Margaritaville restaurant, part of a chain owned by Buffett, was constructed as part of Jurassic World's Main Street; it is destroyed during a battle between the T. rex and the Indominus. Trevorrow based the pterosaur attack sequence on triptych paintings by Hieronymus Bosch that include details for their admirers to observe. Trevorrow said about the scene, \\"I wanted to be able to step back and look at these tableaus of chaotic action and allow people who watch the movie over and over again ... to always see a different story as you look specifically at different parts of the frame.\\" The sequence includes a scene in which Claire's assistant Zara (McGrath) is carried off by several Pteranodon before falling into the park's lagoon, where she is eaten by the Mosasaurus, marking the first female death in the series. Trevorrow wanted to make it \\"the most spectacular death we can possibly imagine\\", while also wanting to surprise moviegoers, stating, \\"Let's have someone die who just doesn't deserve to die at all.\\" McGrath performed her own stunts for the scene, which involved the fall and submersion into the park's lagoon. Most of the filming in New Orleans took place at Big Easy Studios, located at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility complex in East New Orleans. Interior scenes, including the Jurassic World visitor's center, control room and laboratories, were filmed at the Michoud facility, where six stages were occupied for the production. Jack Horner helped designed the educational displays in the Jurassic World visitor center. Approximately 200 extras, acting as park guests sitting on bleachers, were doused with water as part of a scene depicting the Mosasaurus feeding show, which was filmed on an outdoor set at the Michoud facility. The raptor enclosure, an octagonal, -high outdoor structure, was also constructed at the Michoud facility. A set for the original Jurassic Park visitor center was also constructed at the facility. An overturned Ford Explorer tour vehicle from the original film was initially considered for inclusion in the film, but Trevorrow ultimately settled on featuring the original Jurassic Park visitor center instead. One jungle scene was filmed on a soundstage in Louisiana, while the rest were filmed earlier in Hawaii. On June 30, 2014, Robinson, Simpkins and Greer filmed scenes at Louis Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans. In July 2014, fake snow was used in New Orleans for scenes that depict Zach and Gray's house in Wisconsin. An evacuation scene was filmed at Audubon Zoo in New Orleans. Approximately 15 cameras were set up in trees at the zoo to film extras running around in a panic. These scenes were used as security footage for the park's control room. Swamp scenes were filmed in Slidell, Louisiana. The Jurassic World theme park was based on resorts around the world, and production designer Ed Verreaux said \\"we wanted to create an environment modern travelers would really want to visit.\\" Trevorrow wanted the theme park to resemble \\"a place that could exist now, not a sci-fi imagining set in the future.\\" To aid in the design of the Jurassic World control room, Trevorrow and Crowley visited the control rooms at various Universal and Disney theme parks prior to filming. Trevorrow and Crowley were disappointed by the unexciting appearances of real-life control rooms and made the Jurassic World control room more elaborate than its real- life counterparts. The control room set included many television monitors displaying miscellaneous information; some of the footage for the monitors was filmed in Hawaii and at the NASA facility, and some was also obtained from Universal Orlando. Production designers based parts of the control room set on the NASA facility's control room. Filming wrapped on August 5, 2014, after 78 shooting days. =Deleted scenes= Trevorrow filmed two versions of many scenes so he could choose which version to use for the final film. One scene that was deleted from the final film featured a kiss between the control-room characters of Vivian and Lowery. The scene was removed because the film already contained such a scene between Owen and Claire; Trevorrow said, \\"I knew I could only pull off one kiss in this movie.\\" A comedic scene featuring Howard's character and dinosaur feces, which is similar to Laura Dern's scene in the original Jurassic Park, was cut from the cinematic release. Another deleted scene occurs during the fight between the T. rex and the Indominus, which initially would have been watched by park guests. Trevorrow chose not to include the scene because it could not be seamlessly included without disrupting the fight scene, most of which filmed in a single take. During a conversation scene between Wu and Masrani, a line of dialogue in which Wu asks \\"How long do you think you can control it? We won't always be the only ones who can make a dinosaur\\" was cut. An unfilmed scene would have shown the Indominus rex being startled by an animatronic T. rex at the park and subsequently tearing the head off of the animatronic animal. Spielberg objected to the scene because he believed it would be disrespectful to Stan Winston for suggesting computer-animated dinosaurs are better than animatronics. Creatures on screen Jurassic World is the first film in the series without the involvement of Stan Winston, who died in 2008. The animatronic dinosaurs were handled by Winston's former colleagues at Legacy Effects, many of whom worked on the previous three films. Legacy Effects contributed lighting reference models and a practically built animatronic. Visual effects supervisor Phil Tippett and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) also returned to create dinosaurs using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Image Engine also worked on the film's creatures. Tim Alexander served as visual effects supervisor and Jurassic Park supervisor Dennis Muren provided advice to the ILM crew on matters such as lighting the dinosaurs.Failes, Ian. \\"A whole new Jurassic World\\" . FX Guide, June 17, 2015 Some of the computer- generated creatures, including those seen in the park's petting zoo, were created with motion capture using human actors to perform the animals' movements, marking the first time that motion capture technology had been used in the making of a dinosaur film. Trevorrow said, \\"We got to build everyone from the ground up because technology has changed so much that everything is a rebuild\\". New technology such as subsurface scattering allowed the creatures' skin and muscle tissue to be given additional detail that could not be achieved in the earlier films. As with previous films in the series, actors had to imagine many of the film's creatures, which were digitally added during post-production. Actors were aided by cardboard cut-outs and tennis balls on sticks, all of which represented the creatures that would later be added into the film. ILM used its V-scout application, which used an iPad to digitally depict dinosaur models in the filming environment, to further aid the actors. ILM also used the V-scout during location scouting. For more than a year and a half, sound designer Al Nelson and his team traveled to zoos and bird sanctuaries in several states to record various bird sounds, which would be used as vocal effects for the dinosaurs. Part of the fight scene between the T. rex and the Indominus was inspired by a video clip that Spielberg shot of his dogs growling and lunging at each other. Early in pre-production, Tippett helped Trevorrow plan and choreograph the battle sequence by having a scale model created for the scene. Previsualizations of the scene were then created to assist in filming it. Tippett also visited the set during production and later discussed the creature animations with ILM. Trevorrow included several creatures he felt had always deserved a big scene; he stated, \\"I didn't want to just throw the kitchen sink at it. Each of these movies has done a good job at just very carefully, in a measured way, increasing the new dinosaurs that you see.\\" Several creatures make notable appearances in the film: * Indominus rex: In addition to the DNA of T. rex, Velociraptor and cuttlefish, the film's promotional website states that the creature also has the DNA of Carnotaurus, Giganotosaurus, Majungasaurus, and Rugops. Trevorrow said the animal's mixed DNA allowed it to have attributes \\"that no dinosaur was known to have\\". The dinosaur's long forelimbs were based on those of Therizinosaurus. ILM conducted many animation tests to examine the creature's unique characteristics, which include its long arms, raptor claws and small thumbs; its ability to walk on four legs and push itself up from the ground with its claws; and its ability to throw objects with its claws. Glen McIntosh, the animation supervisor for ILM, said, \\"We did a bunch of animation tests to explore that. We found that if you overanimated or made it too anthropomorphic and human-like in its movement, it feels it. The goal was to always make sure she felt like a gigantic animal that was a theropod but taking advantage of its extra features.\\" Several fifth scale maquettes of the Indominus rex were created for lighting reference. Some motion capture tests were done with a human portraying the Indominus rex, although Trevorrow felt that the method did not work well for the animal. The animal sounds used to create the Indominus roars included those from big pigs, whales, beluga whales, dolphins, fennec fox, lions, monkeys, and walruses. * For the film's Velociraptor, Tippett provided animatics and previsualization scenes during pre-production. The creatures were primarily created using motion capture. Image Engine finished the creatures using the motion capture information and a near-final raptor model by ILM. Life-size maquettes of the raptors were also used during scenes in which the creatures are caged. For the sequence in which the raptors run through the jungle hunting for the Indominus, Trevorrow was inspired by a quotation from character Robert Muldoon in the first film, in which he stated that the animals were capable of running at the same speed as a cheetah. McIntosh said, \\"We had seen how smart and cunning the raptors could be as hunters but we hadn't seen them as these unbelievably agile and ferociously fast animals in their native jungle environment\\". Legacy Effects provided one of the full-sized raptor models built for Jurassic Park to the ILM crew to use as a reference. The raptor model weighed approximately and measured approximately tall and long, which helped the animators determine the raptors' locomotion for the hunting scene. The animators determined that an animal of such size probably weighed about —as much as a fully grown Bengal tiger. They referenced an ostrich and a tiger to determine on the raptors' movements. Ostrich was chosen because it is the largest existing bird and the fastest two-legged animal alive; McIntosh said the \\"length of the steps and the cadence of the steps informed the animators\\". McIntosh said tigers were also referenced because of their intense focus while running \\"where the body moves around the head but the head stays fixed and focused on its prey. The tiger also gave us the power of a predator that size charging and weaving through the jungle while on the hunt.\\" For the hunting scene, the raptors' heads were extended forward, giving them a straight, tiger-like, head-to-tail silhouette. Some initial animation tests were created for the hunting sequence about four months before filming. The raptor vocals were created using audio recordings of penguins and toucans. For the sound of the raptors running, a sound team member had microphones attached to his feet that recorded him running across wood chips. * Several individuals of Apatosaurus, including a practically built animatronic that was used for a sequence filmed in Kauaʻi, Hawaii, appear in the film. Because of the cost, Crowley was initially hesitant to have an animatronic created for the film but Trevorrow persuaded him fans of the series would enjoy it. The animatronic consisted of a -long section of the dinosaur's neck, which was used for a close-up shot depicting the animal's death. The audio recordings of a Harris's hawk provided the moans of the wounded Apatosaurus. ILM used elephants as an example of the animation of the Apatosaurus. McIntosh stated that \\"there are no existing animals that have such large necks, but in terms of the size and steps they're taking, elephants are an excellent example of that. Also the way their skin jiggles and sags. You also have impact tremors that rise up through their legs as they take steps.\\" Legacy Effects initially created a small model of the creature for use in the film; Spielberg decided a larger model would be better. The original model was scanned into a computer, allowing artists to create a 3-D model in the size needed for the film. * The film's Tyrannosaurus rex is intended to be the same individual that appeared in the first film. Trevorrow said \\"we took the original design and obviously, technology has changed. So, it's going to move a little bit differently, but it'll move differently because it's older. And we're giving her some scars and we're tightening her skin. So, she has that feeling of, like, an older Burt Lancaster.\\" The T. rex was portrayed using motion capture, and a full scale T. rex foot was created for lighting reference and to help with framing shots. Following the film's release, fans began referring to the individual as \\"Rexy\\". * According to Trevorrow, the film's Mosasaurus was designed to resemble dinosaurs designed by Winston for the franchise's earlier films: \\"We made sure to give her a look and a kind of personality in the way we designed her face that recalled Stan Winston's designs for many of the other dinosaurs in this world. She looks like a Jurassic Park dinosaur.\\" The Mosasaurus roars were created with the audio recordings of a walrus and a beluga whale. * Dimorphodon appears in Jurassic World, marking its first appearance in the series. Using motion capture, dwarf actor Martin Klebba stood in as a Dimorphodon for a scene in which one of the creatures tries to attack Owen. A full scale head of the creature was also created for the scene. Baby brown pelicans provided the vocal effects for the dimorphodons. * For the Pteranodon, vocal effects were created using audio recordings of a mother osprey defending her chicks against another individual. * Ankylosaurus, one of Trevorrow's favorite dinosaurs, is featured in the film. It is one of several creatures he felt was deserving of a substantial scene. Trevorrow noted the death of one of the ankylosaurs as an example of moments in the film \\"that are designed to really make these creatures feel like living animals that you can connect to. Especially since so many of the themes in the film involve our relationship with animals on the planet right now, I wanted them to feel real.\\" * Stegosaurus and Triceratops appear in the film; for their movements, which include running, ILM studied the movements of rhinos and elephants, and copied their movements when animating the dinosaurs. According to Trevorrow, \\"In certain shots, you're looking at real animals running that just have a dinosaur's skin laid over\\". * A running herd of approximately 60 Gallimimus makes an appearance in Jurassic World. Image Engine created the scene with more than 400 frames consisting of up to 50 layers that include clumps of grass, dirt and dust. Artists for Image Engine often viewed the dinosaur species' appearance in the first film, in which a group of running Gallimimus are also depicted. Jeremy Mesana, animation supervisor for Image Engine, said, \\"We were always going back and staring at that little snippet from the first film. It was always interesting trying to find the feeling of the Gallimimus. Trying to capture the same essence of that original shot was really tricky.\\" * Dilophosaurus appeared in the first film and makes a brief appearance in Jurassic World as a hologram in the theme park's visitor center. * Spinosaurus is featured in the theme park as a display skeleton that is destroyed when the T. rex is set free and smashes through it. The scene is meant as revenge for an earlier scene in Jurassic Park III, in which a Spinosaurus kills a T. rex. Music The musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously scored the video games Warpath: Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. John Williams's themes from previous Jurassic Park scores were incorporated by Giacchino, who said; \\"It was a really targeted approach, as to where to [include Williams's themes] and where would make the most sense and where would we most appreciate it, as fans ourselves\\". A soundtrack album was released on June 9, 2015, by Back Lot Music.

(1914) Bassanio is a fictional character in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice. He is a Venetian gentleman who wasted all of his money in order to be seen as a respectable man. To regain his fortune, he is determined to marry Portia, a wealthy, intelligent heiress of Belmont. In order to ask for her hand in marriage, Bassanio and his best friend, Antonio enter into an agreement with the usurer Shylock. Bassanio is not the main character of the play, but his 73 lines compared to Antonio's 47 and Portia's 117 show that he still plays an important role. Even though his actions do not have a large impact on the play, he is responsible for the driving force behind the plot.  Role in the play  In Act I, Scene I, Bassanio first makes an appearance while Antonio is complaining to his friends that he is sad. Antonio’s friends continue to speculate why he is upset, and Antonio asks Bassanio to tell him of the secret love he is hiding. Bassanio explains that he is in love with Portia and needs a loan to show his wealth and power to her. Even though Antonio has no money to give to Bassanio, he still promises to guarantee any loan Bassanio can find. In Act I, Scene III, Shylock finally agrees to lend Bassanio three thousand ducats for three months as long as Antonio guarantees the loan. Shylock is skeptical because Antonio’s ships are still at sea, and there is uncertainty whether they will return within three months. After they all agree to the loan, Bassanio offers Shylock to eat with him, but he denies the offer on the grounds of eating with Christians. After a long debate about the Jewish versus Christian morality of charging interest on loans, Shylock decides to add a clause that says that if they cannot repay the loan, Antonio will have to give a pound of his flesh. Bassanio’s next appearance comes in Act II, Scene II, just as Launcelot decides that he wants to work for Bassanio. He explains in his reasoning that he can no longer bear working for a Jewish man and would rather work for a Christian man. After this, Gratiano appears and asks Bassanio if he can accompany him to Belmont. Before Bassanio agrees, he ensures that Gratiano will behave himself in front of Portia and the other inhabitants of Belmont. In Act III, Scene II, Bassanio finally reaches Belmont, and Portia urges him to wait before choosing between the three caskets that determine if he gets to marry her. Bassanio reasons through his choices and decides to choose the casket of lead because it is a humble choice. When he opens the casket, he finds the portrait of Portia inside and realizes he has chosen correctly. Portia also gives Bassanio a ring that she says if he loses it, their love will be doomed. Finally, a letter from Antonio arrives telling Bassanio of the misfortunes of his ships, and it also explains how eager Shylock is to get his end of the bargain. Antonio pleads for Bassanio to see him one last time, and Portia encourages him to go to Venice after they marry. Act IV, Scene I is the critical trial scene in which the laws of Venice are put to a test to see if Antonio will truly have to give a pound of his flesh. Shylock is insistent that the bond be held true while the Duke and other characters argue on behalf of Antonio. Bassanio steps in to confront Shylock and offers to pay the sum that is owed or even pay more if that is what Shylock wishes. Shylock refuses, and that is when Portia, disguised as a lawyer, begins to argue the case. She finds a loophole to prevent the deal from following through and save the best friend of her husband. After the trial, Bassanio offers money to Portia (still disguised as a lawyer), which she begrudgingly takes, and she asks him for the ring she gave him. Initially, Bassanio refuses to give up the ring since it was an important gift from his wife, but Antonio convinces him to give it to her. In Act V, Scene I, Bassanio and Antonio return to Belmont and greet their wives who appear to be angry that they gave their rings away. After much debate and chastising, the women return the rings and reveal that they were indeed the lawyer and clerk that saved Antonio.Shakespeare, William (1992). The Merchant of Venice. New York, NY: The Folger Shakespeare Library. .  Origins  Most scholars agree that the character of Bassanio has his origins from two texts called Gesta Romanorum and Il Pecorone. The origin of the casket plot comes from the Gesta Romanorum. In contrast to the Merchant of Venice, the person who must make the decision is a woman, not a man, and she makes her decision after God's will \\"not, as Bassanio does, after having reasoned out his choice in the best Renaissance manner.\\" In Il Pecorone, there is a similar plot to the ring plot in the Merchant of Venice, but it only exists between one pair, instead of the two couples in the Merchant of Venice. Additionally, the character that is the Bassanio equivalent does not try to apologize for giving away the ring in Il Pecorone, and those that are involved in the ring plot are father and son, not lovers. Besides basic plot differences, Shakespeare also added specific character traits to Bassanio that did not exist in these previous sources. The characters in the original texts have an \\"absence of any details of characterization.\\" Shakespeare added all of Bassanio's good and less desirable characteristics from scratch. Shakespeare also added the monetary aspect of Bassanio's decision to court Portia.  Analysis  = Homosexuality = The relationship between Bassanio and Antonio is one that has been examined in great detail since the play's first performance in 1605. In older examinations of the play, there is a focus on the friendship between the two. During an early scene in the play, Antonio says to Bassanio that \\"My purse, my person, my extremest means / Lie all unlocked to your occasions.\\" (I.i.138-139) He continues to show his admiration for Bassanio throughout the play through entering the flesh bond and telling Bassanio that he has no need to explain why he needs monetary assistance. Additionally, he states that \\"he only loves the world for Bassanio\\" (II.viii.50), which to some indicates that \\"Antonio's primary emotional bond is with Bassanio.\\" Bassanio also reciprocates Antonio's admiration after he realizes that Antonio is willing to die for him. Bassanio says \\"But life itself, my wife, and all the world / Are not with me esteemed above thy life. / I would lose all—ay, sacrifice them all / Here to this devil—to deliver you\\" (IV.i.475-478). This statement indicated that he would sacrifice his wife, Portia, to save Antonio. In more contemporary analyses of the play, there is a focus on the possible romantic relationship over friendship between Bassanio and Antonio. However, some argue that \\"Antonio is fueled by a homoerotic passion for Bassanio that would substitute person for purse\\" which indicates that Bassanio does not fully reciprocate Antonio's love. = Mercenary = There is much debate between scholars on Bassanio's motivations for marrying Portia. In his first description of Portia, he describes her as \\"a lady richly left\\" (I.i.164) which to some indicates that he is solely focused on her money. However, one critic argues that his actions are fully justified under Elizabethan standards. They argue that it was natural for young gentlemen, such as Bassanio, at the time to marry for wealth since a large part of their identity was to be able to live a life of luxury. Additionally, some argue that this comment cannot be taken to mean his actual feelings since he is speaking to Antonio in order to obtain a loan to marry Portia. In contrast to the idea that he is a mercenary for solely focusing on Portia's money, some argue that he truly loves her for her beauty. Some scholars argue that Bassanio has a change of heart during his travels to Belmont saying that his confessions of love to Portia after the casket scene are truly what he feels. alt=  Portrayals  = Stage = The first known performance of The Merchant of Venice was at the court of King James in 1605. Clifford Williams directed a 1965 production of the play that suggestion for the first time that there could be an implication of homosexuality between Antonio and Bassanio. In a 1987 production of the play directed by Bill Alexander, portrayed a very romantic relationship between Bassanio and Antonio in which they kiss at the end of scene I. At the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1997, a slight change is made to the character of Bassanio in which he spills out gold coins at the end of the trial scene which remain there for the entirety of the play reminding the audience of the underlying motivations of wealth. = Film = An early production of The Merchant of Venice was made in 1914 with Douglas Gerrard as Bassanio. In 1923 a German adaption of The Merchant of Venice was made called the Jew of Mestri with Harry Liedtke as Bassanio. This adaptation attempts to make Shakespeare's play more similar to Il Pecorone, one of the inspirations for The Merchant of Venice, however, Bassanio's character is very similar to the Shakespeare version. One major difference is that in the film is that the characters in the German version have the same names as the Shakespeare characters, but in the American version the names are changed to the names in Il Pecorone. For example, Bassanio's character in the American version is called Giannetto. In a 1947, a made for TV movie was produced by George More O'Ferrall where André Morell plays Bassanio. In 1953, an Italian version called Le Marchand de Venise was made that cast Armando Francioli as Bassanio. Anthony Ainley played Bassanio in a 1969 Orson Welles film called The Merchant of Venice, but the footage was lost and the movie was never finished. Bassanio is played by Jeremy Brett in a 1973 TV movie of the play. John Nettles played Bassanio in a 1980 TV movie of The Merchant of Venice. In a 1996 made for TV movie production, Paul McGann portrayed Bassanio. In 2004, Joseph Fiennes played Bassanio in the film titled The Merchant of Venice. In a review by Roger Ebert, he expresses that this film adaptation makes clear the implication that Antonio is in love Bassanio. Additionally, he examines Bassanio's relationship with Portia and whether his love for her is genuine. = Literature = In 1996, A. R. Gurney published a sequel to The Merchant of Venice called Overtime: A Modern Sequel to the Merchant of Venice. This sequel further explores the relationships between the characters with alternative traits. In this book, the backgrounds of the characters are changed, and it is revealed that Bassanio is of Irish descent, and Antonio is gay.

An English expedition under the command of Francis Drake and Thomas Baskerville attacked the Spanish Main via Nombre de Dios in order to cross the isthmus of Panama.Andrews pp.21-22 Ravaged with dysentery and other diseases the English were repelled and defeated. Drake would die of the former and the expedition was forced to retreat back to England all the while harassed by the Spanish. Background Sir Francis Drake In 1595 Queen Elizabeth I of England had sent Francis Drake and John Hawkins on an expedition against the Spanish Main in an attempt to strike a blow against the source of Spain's gold and silver from their West Indian Fleet. The English tried to capture San Juan in Puerto Rico with 27 canoes and 2,500 men. The attack was a failure and any further action against the strengthened Spanish defences further discouraged Drake from attacking.Benson pp. 297-98 Drake decided to sail away in search of easier prey further South. Disease however by this point had taken its toll on the English force, and John Hawkins died not long after off Puerto Rico. Thomas Baskerville then became second-in-command.Andrews p 152 The expedition then headed towards South America and a week later they closed on Rio de la Hacha. On December 18 Drake seized the town following which the fleet then seized the neighbouring settlements of La Ranchería and Tapia, where more booty was acquired. A ransom failed and Drake promptly sacked and torched the area. The English sailed South West and two weeks later launched an attack on Santa Marta - the city was found abandoned as the Spanish had been forewarned of their arrival. Nevertheless, they managed to capture the Spanish Governor, Francisco Ordonez Flores. A ransom of 4,000 ducats was gained and the governor was released following which the town was burned.Andrews pp. 192-93 By this time the English crews were severely reduced because of disease and therefore an assault on Cartagena de Indias was deemed too risky. Drake instead wanted to march across the isthmus of Panama and attempt to claim it for his own. He headed for Nombre de Dios where he hoped to send his troops led by Baskerville to the Pacific and capture the port of Panama, an important Spanish base where gold and silver was sent to Spain. The Spanish in the region of Central America nevertheless were now prepared.Bradley pp. 122-23 Alonso de Sotomayor had been sent by the Viceroy of Peru to prepare defensive measures on the Camino Real and the Chagres River which would bar any assault Westward.Bicheno. pp 285-86 Assault on the isthmus =Nombre de Dios= On 6 January 1596 Drake and his men dropped anchor off Nombre de Dios without opposition. From the ships' boats they landed near the town but in order to seize it a small fort stood in its way, protected by around hundred militia. Baskerville ordered an assault, following which the fort was overwhelmed and the defenders were put to flight. The town was seized with scant resistance but little plunder was obtained. The place had been warned and the towns few Spanish defenders had retreated and dispersed into the jungle.Sugden pp. 311-12 Drake stayed for two weeks and ransomed the town but on hearing no answer he ordered the town destroyed and so it was set ablaze. All of the ships in the harbour which consisted of frigates, barks, and galliots were thoroughly pillaged after which they were all destroyed or burnt. Although no money was found in the town, a watchtower on the summit of a nearby hill was discovered which contained a chest of silver along with two bars of gold, some pearls, and other valuables. =Battle of Capirilla Hill= Alonso de Sotomayor the Spanish soldier who organised Panama's defence In order to clear the environs of lurking parties of the Spanish, Baskerville picked a force of 750 men. On 20 January they started upon the perilous march by the old Panama road. They occupied the small settlement of Venta de la Quebrada two days later but on the third day, after an exhausting march of nearly thirty miles in incessant rain and high humidity, Baskerville had found himself confronted by a gorge near another settlement of Capirilla. As furthered forward this became more precipitous and the road was dominated from above by a menacing hill.Andrews pp 204-05 Surrounding the top of the hill was an impressive defensive structure composed of a defile with an impenetrable abatis. Defending this fort was around seventy Spanish troops under Captain Juan Enríquez Conabut dug in to bar the English advance across the isthmus. Baskerville nevertheless ordered an attack to take the hill but this terrain was well chosen by the Spanish; the English attempted for three hours to dislodge the defenders. Each time they assaulted however they were repelled and suffered heavy casualties.Corbett pp. 398-99 The Spaniards were then reinforced by an additional fifty arquebusiers under Captain Hernando de Lierno Agüero which turned the tide. By this time half of Baskerville's remaining provisions and ammunition were ruined by the wet due to the rain and heavy humidity. Even if he did take the hill he realised he would have to fight his way through a succession of such obstacles to Panama and would have no troops left to hold it. The English retreated leaving the hill in the hands of the victorious Spaniards. Losses for the English were over sixty men killed or wounded including Baskerville's brother Nicholas. Spanish losses were only seven killed with an unknown number wounded. Baskerville's contingent, many of them sick and now demoralised, sent a desperate note to Drake to meet him with supplies and 200 men on the way back. Eventually the depleted force rejoined Drake at Nombre de Dios on 22 January. Drake's and the crews' morale plummeted and three days later they departed westward. =Death of Drake= On January 27 Drake's fleet anchored off Escudo de Veraguas Island, but his force by this time was ravaged by disease.Sugden pp. 313 The fittest men which numbered 37 men attempted to draw water from the Fator River were then set upon by angry Spanish residents (many of whom were freed salves) of Santiago del Príncipe from on the mainland opposite.Wheat p. 64 The English party were then massacred with only handful escaping. Drake with this bitter news ordered the fleet to sail east toward Porto Bello but within a few days he himself was suffering from severe dysentery. Drake on the night of 28 – 29 January 1596 succumbed aboard his flagship Defiance. The following morning before dying, Drake asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a lead- lined coffin, off Buenaventura Island near Porto Bello. Baskerville assumed command of the fleet and, after contemplating a repeat attack against Santa Marta he decided against it and ordered his disheartened men toward Santigao. According to the information they had, a fleet of sixty sail had been sent out from Spain against them, and this they believed would be stationed at the Yucatan Channel to intercept their homeward course. It was therefore agreed to hold together and attempt to escape by the outward bound route. To this end the fleet was compressed and reorganised, and as though in honour of the name, Thomas Drake was made vice-admiral. Once there and with the crews further weakened by disease he finally compelled a retreat back to England. In the process the 195-ton Elizabeth and 50-ton Delight were scuttled due to the poor conditions they were in, as well as a lack of crew to sail them.Wernham p 51 Aftermath The Spanish intercepted the retreating English near the Isla de la Juventud; in the ensuing Battle of Pinos, they managed to drive off the Spanish fleet and escape to England. Despite the expedition's failure, the gold sent to Spain was not enough; in 1597, Philip II of Spain defaulted on his debts and was unable to obtain credit for the last two years of his reign.Bicheno p. 288 News of Drake's death was received with rejoicing along the Spanish Main; in Spain itself, the devout greeted it as a sign the sins for which Heaven had permitted him to torment them had been expiated.Benson p. 228 The Spanish poet Lope de Vega wrote a triumphant poem to celebrate the removal of the scourge of the Church. Sir Francis Drake buried at sea. One of 4 bronze relief plaques on the base of the Drake statue in Tavistock in Devon When news of the defeat arrived in England, Elizabeth demanded this 'humiliation' be avenged. To demonstrate continuing English naval strength, she ordered George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland to seize San Juan and hold it for as long as possible.Van Middeldyk p. 114 In June, Cumberland succeeded where Drake had failed and captured San Juan, which he held for nearly two months before disease forced his withdrawal. =Drakes coffin= Drakes' coffin is assumed to have been deposited off Buenaventura Island, near the Elizabeth and the Delight, which were scuttled in Portobelo Bay. Wreckage thought to be that of the two ships was found by divers in 2011 but attempts to locate the coffin have been unsuccessful.

Incumbent mayor Steve Luecke, who had become mayor after his predecessor Joe Kernan became Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, was reelected to a first full- term (and second overall term). Luecke faced Republican challenger Steven Bradley. Nominations =Democratic primary= During the Democratic primary Luecke was challenged by Portage Township Assessor John Voorde as well as Kevin C. Horton and Zbigniew \\"Ziggy\\" Borowski. Voorde arose as the most significant challenger to Luecke. Voorde was the son of past mayor Edward F.

By April, polls reportedly showed Luecke with a double-digit lead over Voorde. =Republican primary= Steve Bradley defeated Melvin Townsend in the Republican primary. General election During the election campaign, Bradley criticized Luecke's record on public safety. Bradley used FBI statistics to claim that New York City was safer than South Bend in regards to violent crime. However, Luecke accused Bradley of distorting statistics, accusing Bradley of being \\"incorrigible\\" and using a Richard Nixon-style campaign tactic of distributing falsehoods. Bradley criticized Luecke for taking what he argued was too long to appoint a new police chief after South Bend's previous police chief resigned after being charged with a DUI, stating, It's time for the mayor to act like a mayor and show some leadership,\\" and declaring that the South Bend Police Department had been left \\"rudderless\\". Bradley proposed a business incentive development plan. Bradley placed emphasis on the city's loss of 1,000 jobs at AMGeneral and South Bend Stamping. Bradley attacked Luecke for having been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. Bradley ran a billboard which read \\"My girlfriend said it's either her or south bend. My girlfriend is gone. For me it's South Bend\\". This billboard was speculated to be one of the reasons Bradley would be shown to poll poorly among women voters. Ahead of the election, polls showed Luecke to be in the lead. A poll conducted October 13-15 by Howey Political Report found Luecke leading 51 to 32 (with 17% of respondents being \\"undecided\\") with a +/-5.2 margin. A similarly-timed South Bend Tribune poll found Luecke to have a 14-point lead. Additionally, South Bend was considered to be a strongly Demcoratic city.

This was during the tenure of Rao Saheb T. S. Paulus,The Commonwealth Year Book, Volume 2, 1956, p.518 as Principal. Continuing his academics, Melanchthon proceeded to Waltair and enrolled for a postgraduate programme leading to M.A. at Andhra University. Incidentally, the Geologist, Bunyan Edmund Vijayam, was also studying at the University during the same time and the two were contemporaries. The University was headed by Vice-chancellor V. S. Krishna during that period. Initially after his postgraduate studies, Melanchthon worked in the Andhra Pradesh Government serving in a Mandal Office. Around this time, he found his calling towards full-time priesthood. Much like Saint Ambrose of Milan, the Early Church Father, Melanchthon resigned from Government service and proceeded to the Office of the President of Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society headquartered in Guntur, which was headed by G.

By the end of the three-year course in 1961, Melanchthon performed well in his examinations and secured two University-level prizes, viz., George Howells Prize in History of Religions and Senators' Prize in Biblical Studies and was awarded a Bachelor of Divinity degree by the Senate of Serampore College (University) in the ensuing convocation of 1962 led by its Registrar, C. Devasahayam, CBCNC. =Advanced spiritual studies= After a couple of years' of parish ministry between 1961-1965, Melanchthon returned to his Alma mater to pursue a postgraduate course leading to M.

However, by the turn of the academic year 1975-1976, Melanchthon had to return to Bangalore to resume his teaching duties as his request for extension of leave was not granted, a move which brought an endThere have been instances of doctoral students being asked to return to their institutions ending their doctoral programme abruptly.

Career as Pastor and Teacher After Melanchthon stepped out of the portals of his seminary in 1961, he was ordained as a Pastor of Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society by K. Krupadanam, AELC, then President. Melanchthon then began to minister in Konaseema region at Kothapeta, East Godavari district in the 1960s, where Christianity was propagated in the Delta regionMartin Luther Dolbeer, The Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church: A Brief History, Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society, Rajahmundry, 1951, p.49. by the Lutheran missions in the late 19th century led by a German missionary, Rudolph F.

After serving as a Pastor, Melanchthon returned to his alma mater in 1965 to take up a postgraduate course. In 1968, during the Principalship of Joshua Russell Chandran, Melanchthon joined as Faculty Member at United Theological College, Bangalore, where Melanchthon used to teach Religions in India for students pursuing B. D. for nearly two decades until 1988. Many of his graduate students have contributed to the full spectrum of the ministries of the Church in India, who include, R. S. Sugirtharajah, J. W. Gladstone, P. J. Lawrence, S. J. Theodore, Timotheas Hembrom, Dharmakkan Dhanaraj, Paul Rajashekar, H. S. Wilson, Elizabeth Paul, Basil Rebera, Christopher Asir, John Sadananda, Sydney Salins, P.

Paralytic stroke and death During 1987-1988 while Melanchthon went on an assignment to Leonard Theological College, Jabalpur, he also happened to visit Pachmarhi, a hill station, where he suffered a Paralytic stroke. By the time he was brought back to Jabalpur for administering treatment, precious moments were lost due to lack of immediate medical access, resulting in severe Brain damage. Melanchthon was then taken by rail to Bangalore and treated at the Baptist Hospital, Hebbal. By then, E. C. John, CSI who had already taken up the Principalship, ensured that Melanchthon was kept away from teaching assignments until his recovery. Melanchthon gradually began to recover, but remained confined to his quarters in the campus. However, even after nearly six years of sustained treatment, Melanchthon could not recover fully and passed away on 22 September 1994. Gnana Robinson, CSI, then Principal and led the academic community in paying its obeisances. Melanchthon was buried with ecclesiastical honours at Hosur Indian Christian Cemetery, Bangalore. Melanchthon and the case of social security for Theologians In Melanchthon's untimely demise, the whole gamut of social security and health insurance coverage of Theologians comes to the fore. While the State has provided means through Legislation to ensure such safety through savings and health schemes, only a few of these are applied to Theological fraternity in India, who are otherwise employed in institutions registered as legal bodies either through Indian Trusts Act, 1882 (e.g. Bible Society of India), Indian Companies Act, 1956 (e.g. Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches), Societies Registration Act, 1860 (e.g. Andhra Christian Theological College), or such other Legislative acts applicable in India. There has only been a selective extension of The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, The Employees' State Insurance, 1948, Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provident Act, 1952, in theological institutions, and Theologians continue to be at risk being at the sole mercy of the institution and its management. A few of the notable Theologians who met untimely deaths while still in service include, Mutyala Theophilus (1895-1946), D. S. Amalorpavadass (1932-1990), George Soares-Prabhu (1929-1995), and others with the recent one being Siga Arles (1950-2015). The Cantabrigian and Old Testament Scholar, Victor Premasagar (1927-2005), then on a teaching assignment with Bethel Bible College, Guntur had been at the receiving end due to medical negligence of an Ophthalmologist and had issues with visibility and later met his death in the institution, while being its Principal. Somehow, the extended arm of social security as envisaged by State for the good of every Citizen of India employed in some entity or the other, seems to elude Theologians. Christianity in India dates back to AD 52. The Indian yogi and mystic, Jaggi Vasudev believes that the Church is organized, but he seemed to have said that in matters of organizational setup.Ajay Singh, Guru Mantra: This isn't the time for coalition government - Right now the coalition that we are seeing is just about winning the election, says Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudevon Opposition's attempt to form a grand alliance against Modi government in the upcoming Lok Sabha Election, Firstpost, 16 September 2019.

Incumbent mayor Joe Kernan was reelected to a third term, defeating Republican challenger Michael C. \\"Mike\\" Waite. In winning this election, Kernan became the first South Bend mayor since 1905 to win a third term. It also made Kernan poised to break the record, at the time, for longest-serving mayor of South Bend. Primaries =Democratic primary= Joe Kernan won renomination. =Republican primary= Waite, a businessman who had previously been an unsuccessful candidate in the 1987 South Bend Republican mayoral primary and had never before held public office, won a Republican primary that also featured Larry M. Scott and James W. Philson. Waite was president of High Tech Alarm Corporation Inc. General election Republican Mike Waite encountered several stumbling blocks during his candidacy, including an arrest for unpaid bills and a lawsuit for backpay on delinquent child support. Much of the campaign season would center on these controversies. Waite claimed his arrest was politically motivated and orchestrated by Kernan and the St. Joseph County Sheriff, with Kernan denying this accusation. Ultimately, while Waite remained their nominee, the Republican Party withdrew their backing of his candidacy. Kernan had attracted respect as mayor for his ability to attract economic development to the community. Kernan campaigned as an opponent of further privatization in South Bend. Kernan did not oppose all and any privatization, but was, rather, an opponent of what he called the, \\"wholesale auction of the city's assets\\". South Bend Republicans had been proponents of further privatization. Waite criticized Kernan on the issue of crime, accusing him of both ignoring and denying the issue. Kernan argued that he had taken measures to address crime, such as increasing the size of the city's police force by 34 officers since 1991. Kernan also claimed theat the rate of violent crime had decreased 19% since the previous year. Kernan, however, conceded that crime was, \\"the most significant challenge we face in the community\\". Indicative of the issue of crime, the city had already seen a record murder total in 1995 by the time of the election. Waite's proposals to address crime included spending more funds on the police department, restructuring the police department, and increasing the number of police officers. He argued that this could be accomplished without increasing taxes. Another issue was a proposed minor league ice hockey arena in South Bend. The city had been approached by an interested minor league ice hockey franchise, and Kernan was open to the idea, and was working to create a committee to weigh the cost and benefits of such a venture. Waite opposed the creation of a South Bend hockey franchise, arguing that stadium financing would take away funding better spent on other needs. Waite also criticized the scheme, arguing that it was problematic that such a new arena would create competition with the region's existing venues such as the Edmund P. Joyce Center. Waite also argued, \\"If people want to watch hockey they can go see the Notre Dame hockey team.\\" Another issue debated was the financing for the College Football Hall of Fame, with Waite criticizing the lack of transparency behind its financing and contracts. He characterized it to be a tax burden on the city. At the time, attracting the College Football Hall of Fame to South Bend had been considered one of Kernan's successes as mayor. Another issue debated was the Blackthorn development, which would see a privately managed golf course surrounded by office developments. Waite opposed this project, while Kernan supported it, arguing that it had added 3,000 jobs and $25 million in investment to the city. Kernan declared, \\"When Waite says he opposes Blackthorn, he is saying he opposes jobs in the community\\". Waite criticized Kernan for being allegedly indifferent towards the proposed establishment of an adult bookstore on South Main Street saying, \\"Mayor Joe Kernan would rather subsidize porno book than school books.\\" Kernan supported a measure to implement an option tax, arguing that it would provide property tax relief and enable capital improvements. Waite stood in opposition to any new taxes. Waite argued that the city needed more higher paying jobs, and that it was an issue that South Bend had more service sector employees than manufacturing sector, a reality which Waite accredited to planning choices the South Bend city government had made. Waite lodged allegations of wrongful actions by Kernan. Speculation had arisen that Kernan would be a prospective nominee for lieutenant governor in the 1996 Indiana gubernatorial election. Kernan denied having any such aspirations at the time, however, he would ultimately be the lieutenant gubernatorial nominee the following year and was elected as such. =Result= At the time, the voter turnout was considered to be relatively low, with the turnout equating to roughly 20% of the city's overall populace. Kernan's more than 82% of the vote set a record for South Bend mayoral elections. Kernan became the first South Bend mayor since 1905 to be elected to a third term. The election made Kernan poised to become the city's longest-serving mayor at the time.

It was released on LP in 1978 and on CD in 1992. Its CD version included nine bonus arias of Haydn's, mostly written to be inserted into other composers' works, performed by Mathis and the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne under the direction of Armin Jordan. Background At the time when the album was taped, no complete autograph score of the opera was known to exist. There were fragmentary autographs in collections in Berlin, Budapest, Cracow and Paris, and scholars had also found three contemporary copies - one, lacking Act 3, in Brussels, and two, complete, in Brno and Vienna. There are many inconsistencies between these various documents, reflecting the numerous revisions of his opera that Haydn undertook. The Vienna score was the principal source of the edition used by Doráti. When Doráti approached Decca and other companies to suggest recording Haydn's operas, they rejected his proposal as too risky. Il mondo della luna and the other works in Doráti's Haydn cycle were only taped after Philips's producer, Erik Smith, had secured support from the European Broadcasting Union.Gramophone, September 1976, p. 403 Recording The opera was recorded using analogue technology in September 1977 in the Grande Salle of the community theatre in Épalinges, a village high in the hills above Lausanne, Switzerland. The bonus arias included in the appendix of the CD issue of the album were recorded in the same location in June 1980. Packaging The cover of the CD edition of the album was designed under the art direction of Ton Friesen and features photography by Hans Morren. Critical reception Joseph Haydn, portrayed by Ludwig Guttenbrunn Lionel Salter reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in September 1978. Il mondo della luna was a better drama than some of Haydn's other operas, he thought, in that it did not have a \\"cat's-cradle [plot] full of confusing intrigue and confused motivation\\". Its musical excellence was vouchsafed by Haydn's recycling eight excerpts from it in his flute trios, his Symphony No. 63 and the Benedictus of his Mariazell Mass. As for the album itself, it was blessed with a cast that was \\"an uncommonly strong one, almost without weakness\\". Domenico Trimarchi, \\"particularly alert to textual nuances\\", painted a persuasive portrait of Buonafede, the wealthy old innocent being duped by his daughters' and maidservant's lovers. Luigi Alva was equally enjoyable as Ecclitico, the bogus astronomer - styled an astrologer by a librettist too ignorant to know the difference - who tricked his future father-in-law into believing that he had been miraculously transported to the moon. Anthony Rolfe Johnson, playing the servant Cecco, \\"[made] the most of his moment of glory as the mock Lunar Emperor\\". The opera's other male role, Ernesto, originally an alto part sung by a castrato, was undertaken by Lucia Valentini Terrani in the album's least successful performance. Her voice was \\"at times less than ideally steady\\", and she seldom sounded convincingly masculine. Doráti's other female soloists sang impeccably. As Clarice, the darling of the star-gazing confidence trickster, Edith Mathis \\"[negotiated] the fioriture of 'Son fanciulla da marito' with brilliant clarity\\". As Clarice's sister Flaminia, Ernesto's best beloved, \\"that admirable stylist Arleen Augér [revelled] in her tremendous bravura aria 'Ragion nell'arma' ... and in the tender 'Se la mia stella'\\". And as Lisetta, the below-stairs mezzo wooed by Cecco, Frederica von Stade dispatched her helter-skelter comic numbers with apparently effortless virtuosity. In this particular opera, the contribution made by Haydn's orchestra was a more important ingredient than usual: he had responded to its extraterrestrial theme with a sopranino recorder, some unusual violin harmonics and imaginative echo effects. Happily Doráti's band played better for him on Il mondo della luna than on any of the other albums in his Haydn cycle. Philips's production team had done their work well too, although not quite perfectly - a duet seemed to have been edited clumsily, and at one point Trimarchi sounded anomalously far from his microphone. The album's one serious negative lay in Doráti's handling of its recitatives (vital to the opera's narrative coherence). They were far too slow, dragging on ad infinitum.Gramophone, September 1978, p. 537 Eric Salzman reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in January 1979. He took a rather dimmer view of the opera than Salter. Its libretto, he wrote, was one of several \\"strained and overly sophisticated eighteenth-century comedies about human folly\\", and it was telling that Haydn had apparently struggled to work up much enthusiasm for composing it. All of his score was \\"solid stuff\\", but it was only in its pseudo-lunar Act 2 that his inventiveness truly flourished. At least the album presented the opera satisfactorily. The best of its soloists were Domenico Trimarchi as the credulous old gentleman and Frederica von Stade as a forerunner of the worldly-wise Despina. The runners-up for top honours were Anthony Rolfe Johnson, \\"modestly effective\\" in the stock opera buffa role of the comical servant, and Edith Mathis as one of Mr Good-faith's daughters. Luigi Alva's Ecclitico was marred by some less than perfect evenness. The orchestra's playing was nicely Haydnesque, and Doráti's conducting was \\"sensitive and stylish\\". A very appealing audio quality was the icing on the cake of a \\"highly commendable\\" album. People beginning to explore Haydn's operas would do better to start with the superior Orlando Paladino, but any confirmed Haydn enthusiast should certainly find an evening with Il mondo della luna time well spent.Stereo Review, January 1979, pp. 100-102 Carlo Goldoni portrayed in 1750 J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in April 1979, discussing it together with four other albums in Doráti's Haydn opera cycle. All five, he thought, were outstanding performances of music replete with vivacious musical fantasy. Each of them had many delightful arias, and his listening notes were peppered with asterisks and underlinings that made him want to put down his pen and go straight back to his turntable. Il mondo della luna was not quite as enjoyable as Orlando Paladino, the most impressive of the series to have appeared at that point, but it was still well worth investigating. \\"The records present an elegant, lightly ironical comedy\\", he wrote, \\"and an enchanting score. Beginning in laughter, it ends in affection: there is much more humanity in it than an outline of the plot might suggest.\\"Gramophone, April 1979, p. 1673 Salter revisited the album in Gramophone in June 1993, reviewing it together with Doráti's other Haydn opera recordings when all eight albums were simultaneously issued on CD. Most of the operas suffered, he thought, from the ineptitude of their librettists, few of whom were anywhere near as good as Mozart's Lorenzo da Ponte. That said, the operas provided \\"superb opportunities for first-class singers\\", and Philips had been able to recruit a company of artists sufficiently accomplished to meet Haydn's challenges. \\"A great strength of [these albums]\\", he wrote, \\"is the very high standard of performance of music that is not only immensely demanding of the artists but extremely attractive to the listener\\". Further merits of the project were the sprightly playing of the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra and the wealth of documentation in Philips's booklets. Salter's opinion of Doráti's Il mondo della luna in particular was exactly the same as when he had heard the recording on LP. What especially delighted him about the album's CD version was the inclusion of nine newly released soprano arias as bonus tracks. Most were variations on the theme of a woman \\"indignant or cynical about the deception of men\\", but there was also a striking 1790 number written for an opera seria that seemed to be about the sack of Troy.Gramophone, June 1993, pp. 99-100 Track listing, CD1 Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) Il mondo della luna, drama giocosa in tre atti (Eszterháza, 1777), Hob.

On the promenade there are statues of the heroes of the War of Independence, as well as fountains, stairs, squares, roads and walls. Since 1993, the Paseo Los Próceres and the entire annex system was declared a National Historic Landmark. History It was inaugurated in 1956 by President Marcos Pérez Jiménez, calling it El Sistema de Nacionalidad (The System of Nationality) in honor of the independence struggles of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. It was created to represent the Venezuelan military institution on an urban scale, it is part of the System of Nationality which is made up of several elements linked by a large road and pedestrian axis that articulates the ceremonial complex structured by the great Courtyard of Honor as a highlight and receiver of the urban axis that begins in the University City of Caracas. Structure The monument is defined by two rows of lighting poles as virtual walls. Located on the perimeter of Fort Tiuna, the largest national military complex, it articulates with the Military Academy of Venezuela, the parade courtyard, the monoliths of heroes, an oval of fountains, gardens and baroque ornaments. Glasses, cups and other pieces that commemorate the Greek Hellenistic period as the statue of the god of the waters, Poseidon, complement the architectural complex. Deployed along a two-kilometer avenue, it has driveways and grandstands on the sides, while fountains, gardens, four monoliths and huge statues in honor of the independence heroes extend in the center. It's the stage of great military parades and other official acts. The Monument to the Heroes is formed by four parallelepipeds: two vertical ones made of travertine marble and two horizontal ones in black marble, each with 30 meters/98 ft in length and a total weight of 300 tons/672.000 lb. On the horizontal walls there are bronze statues representing the heroes of independence: Simón Bolívar, Antonio José de Sucre, Rafael Urdaneta, Santiago Mariño, Francisco de Miranda, José Antonio Páez, Manuel Piar, José Félix Ribas, Luis Brión, Juan Bautista Arismendi and José Francisco Bermúdez. In the monoliths the names of the Venezuelan heroes and the four battles that sealed the independence of the Bolivarian countries were carved: Ayacucho, Boyacá, Carabobo and Pichincha, also represented in high relief. The Paseo de los Próceres, part of these emblematic blocks, is a wide avenue whose side stands are stands for military parades and official events. The monument is part of the System of the Nationality whose original function was to connect the Central University of Venezuela with the Military School. It was designed in Neoclassical style by Malaussena Avenue Los Próceres, presided over by the monument dedicated to national heroes, intended to occupy, in the urban geography of Caracas, the place of the Champs-Élysées occupy in Paris. The Paseo Los ilustres (The illustrious' walk) is a large vehicular avenue with driveways and a pedestrian island in the middle, erected as a tribute to the illustrious children of the nation, is the point of exchange of civil and military population, moving the Circle of Forces to the side Armed, headquarters for social events of members of the military institution. On the other hand, the Paseo de los Símbolos (Walk of the Symbols) is defined by a sculptural set made in bronze, on a marble pedestal and a water mirror. Performed by Ernesto Maragall in 1957, it constitutes an allegory to the Venezuelan national symbols: the coat of arms, the flag and the national anthem. On the Paseo Los Precursores (The precursors' walk) there's a sculpture of an Indian who stands on his horse, made of bronze, in the middle of a platform and marble base guarded by two lions, also by Maragall. A commemorative obelisk, mosaic paths, as well as the symmetrical design of the complex, offer the place a face of serenity, while bas-reliefs made in 1957 by sculptor Hugo Daini can be seen on one of the walls of the column. Scattered among the succession of fountains, squares and paths that go from the Monument of the Precursors to that of the Próceres are other sculptural pieces in the form of nymph figures, executed in artificial stone. On the walk you can see the murals that tell the history of Venezuela from the colonization.

He was an early member of the British Archaeological Association and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He composed several works on the history of his home county, Kent, and the Canterbury Cathedral, including: a criticism of Robert Willis' history of the cathedral, a petition of the cathedral's lay clerks for higher wages, and a history of Kentish customs. Early life and Sandys family Charles Sandys was born on 26 October 1786, to a Canterbury solicitor, Edwin Humphrey Sandys, and his second wife, Helen. On his father's side, he was born into the Sandys family, and so traces his lineage back as a direct descendant of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York (1576–1588), according to Burke's Landed Gentry. His mother was the heiress of Edward, Lord Chick. The Sandys family later took a prominent part in the colonization of Virginia. Antiquarian career While in Canterbury, Sandys became a keen antiquarian, especially relating to those antiquities of the historic county of Kent. In 1844, he became an early member of the British Archaeological Association, out of an interest in Kentish archeology. In 1845, he presented an impression of a brass seal, from the time of Edward III, on 23 December. The following year, he published his first book, A Critical Dissertation on Professor Willis's \\"Architectural History of Canterbury Cathedral\\" (1846). The work was dedicated to upholding William Gostling's view of the structural history of Canterbury Cathedral, against Robert Willis' \\"fanciful hypothesis\\", that the cathedral was almost entirely built in Archbishop Lanfranc's time, after the Norman conquest. J. G. Waller (in the Journal of the British Archeological Association) reviewed it favourably, claiming it \\"is exceeding useful and will be read with profit by all who feel interested in the metropolitan church of Canterbury\\", praising it for correctly pointing out flaws in Willis' work. Modern biographer of Willis, Alexandrina Buchanan, has taken a less positive view of the work, declaring that \\"in reality, it was Sandys who was guilty as charged [in making incorrect historical deductions], though Willis did not condescend to make this point\\". In the 1846 third Annual Congress of the British Archaeological Association, then held in Gloucestershire, Sandys presented a paper, entitled \\"On the Celtic of Ancient British Mound, called 'The Dane-John Hill', at Canterbury\\", on the particulars of the local mound. The same year, on 18 June, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries In 1848, he edited and introduced The Memorial and Case of the Clerici-Laici or Lay-Clerks of Canterbury Cathedral, a petition from the lay clerks of Canterbury Cathedral, to the Lord John Russell, asking for greater wages in comparison to the minor canons. Sandys composed a brief manuscript history of Reculver, Kent, from the Roman occupation to Henry VIII's reign. This was included by C. Roach Smith in his History and Antiquities of Richborough, Reculver, and Lymne (1850), and the manuscript is now held in the library of Canterbury Cathedral. In 1851, Sandys composed Consuetudines Kanciae: A History of Gavelkind and other Remarkable Customs in the County of Kent, described by his ODNB biographer, Shirley Burgoyne Black, as \\"his principal work\\". In his conclusion to the work, Sandys patriotically summed it up as \\"conduct[ing] the reader to the primeval fountains of historic truth, — to the pure sources of the English Constitution. And thus have we attempted to pourtray, in vivid contrast, the conflicting elements of Saxon liberty and Norman despotism\\"; wishing the reader to \\"dr[i]nk deeply of the gushing tide of patriotism\\". Personal life and death In 1808, Sandys became a solicitor, and took up a practise in Canterbury, Kent, which he continued until 1857. Here, he married Sedley Frances Burdett on 27 May 1815. Together, they had multiple children. In 1857, Sandys came across financial difficulty and travelled abroad, where, in 1859, at the age of 73, he died.

That doesn’t mean that it’s a good show, but at least it’s not terrible.\\" Keller adds that Big Show can do physical comedy \\"very well,\\" while praising Munn for \\"handl[ing] it like a pro\\" and describing the daughter characters as the \\"usual mix of overly-verbal and super-precocious kids\\". Matt Fowler of IGN described the show as having \\"the potential to be either wholly terrible or fully great. The truth, overall, lies somewhere in between as Big Show proves himself to be an amiable, glowing, towering 'family man' capable of carrying multi-cam sitcom shenanigans.\\" Randall Colbum of The A.V. Club also likened the sitcom to the TGIF sitcoms of the 1990s, and wrote: \\"As tends to happen in these sorts of stories, the very act of a man so large demonstrating vulnerability is all the punchline an audience needs.\\" Common Sense Media gave the show three out of five stars, describing it as \\"a little rough, but mostly sweet.\\" A comedic recap and review podcast about the show, The Big Show Show Show, was launched in May 2020.

It is targeted towards the budget and educational markets. Unlike previous iPad models, which have a 9.7-inch display, the device is the first in the entry-level iPad lineup to feature a larger 10.2-inch display size. Its successor, the iPad (2020) was revealed on September 15, 2020, This iPad was discontinued on that same day. iPad 8 was released on September 18, 2020, and it has replaced iPad 7 since then. History Rumors centering around a successor to the 2018 iPad began to surface in the first half of 2019, when seven iPad models were registered on the Eurasian Economic Commission, a database known for providing hints about upcoming devices to be released by Apple. One of the models was believed to be a new entry-level iPad, which would allegedly have minor design upgrades as compared to the 2018 iPad. Several sources have claimed that the new model would feature a dual- lens rear camera and that its screen size may measure 10.2 inches, up from the 9.7-inch screen size of previous iPad models. Reports from BGR also claimed that the device could begin its mass production in July 2019, with a predicted release date of around the third quarter of that year. This iPad was then revealed by Apple on September 10, 2019, at the Steve Jobs Theater with a scheduled release date of September 30 of that year. It was announced to retail at a starting price of $329 in the United States. The iPad was released on the online Apple Store on September 25, 2019.

In addition to eliminating recharging and Bluetooth pairing, the direct connection satisfies the education market's requirement for direct connection only during standardized tests. All iPads also retain backwards compatibility with third-party accessory Bluetooth keyboards. Reception The 2019 10.2-inch iPad was criticized for the a lack of a processor upgrade over the previous year's 9.7-inch model.

History  Marzoy-Mokhk is just north of the village of Guni. It was supposedly founded by immigrants from this village, on its pasture lands. In the 1920s, Marzoy-Mokhk began to grow quickly and became a larger settlement. The village extended along the foothills for 3 to 4 kilometers. Around the same time, two farms, Upper Farm () and Lower Farm () were created. They were mostly settled by immigrants from the villages of Guni, Khazhi-Aul and Cheberloy. In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Marzoy-Mokhk, as well as its two farms, were completely destroyed and abandoned. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Vedensky District of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1957, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen- Ingush ASSR was restored, the village's former residents were originally not allowed to resettle in the area, but this ban was eventually lifted and the area was resettled in 1958. In 1958, an elementary school was built in Marzoy- Mokhk. At the same time, a small library also appeared in the village. A high school was later built in the center of the village.

The text inspires a call to action for women to critique the feminist movement in the 20th century, while designing an agenda to secure women's identity within the changing spheres of society. This action is attained by casting out traditional roles and demolishing the distinction between the two sexes. The manifesto is dependent on political and rational involvement.  Historical and Literary Context  Loy wrote Feminist Manifesto in 1914, while living in an expatriate community in Florence, Italy. The Great War was underway, and lasted from 1914 until 1918, resulting in a huge disruption in social and economic values. Women were required to enter the workforce as a substitution for the men who were away at war. As the war came to an end, Parliament voted in favor of the Representation of the People Act. This law made it possible for women in England to vote for the first time, although it contained stipulations concerning those who were able to maintain social standing. In response to the changing spheres, Loy wrote Feminist Manifesto. The manifesto begins with a direct call on women: > The feminist movement as at present instituted is Inadequate. Women if you > want to realize yourselves—you are on the eve of a devastating psychological > upheaval—all your pet illusions must be unmasked—the lies of centuries have > got to go—are you prepared for the Wrench—? There is no half-measure—NO > scratching on the surface of the rubbish heap of tradition, will bring about > Reform, the only method is Absolute Demolition. Cease to place your > confidence in economic legislation, vice-crusades & uniform education—you > are glossing over Reality. Professional & commercial careers are opening up > for you—Is that all you want?  Impact on Feminism and Manifestos  = Legacy in Feminist Theory = Feminist manifestos like Valerie Solanas's SCUM Manifesto have borrowed some of the ideas employed in Feminist Manifesto, such as the argument that men have run the world disruptively and need to be stopped. = Manifesto Theory = The Modernist Manifesto is considered to be a public declaration of artistic convictions. This particular manifesto employs this characteristic by utilizing a more expressive form concerning word choice and sentence placement. Its form and language reflect a stance of autonomy and individuality using intense language for the purpose of getting readers invested. The manifesto originated from the idea to make works public. This same idea was practical in conveying a particular medium in which the audience was not specified, but intrigued by the intense tone and information presented through text. In the Modernist manifesto, hostile rhetoric became an essential tool to the material previously written.  Reception and Criticism  Feminist Manifesto has been one of the many templates used concerning women's issues since its unpublished release. Scholars such as Susan Gilmore and Cristanne Miller argue that the text itself is a reflection of Loy's personal experience. \\"Susan Gilmore, for instance, defines impersonality as a masculinist striving for “invisibility” through the “transcendence” of the “emotion[al]” and the “personal,” and uses “Feminist Manifesto” to categorize Loy’s project as a contrary aesthetic that “foregrounds the female poet’s visibility” and an “authority borne not of cultural transcendence but of cultural disenfranchisement.”' \\"'Similarly, Cristanne Miller, also citing the manifesto and aligning impersonality with the negation of the personal, contends that Loy “eschew[s] even apparent lyric impersonality” by “maintain[ing] strong illocutionary and suggestively autobiographical elements” in her poetry.'\\" Further reading   References  Category:Manifestos Category:Feminist works ","title":"Feminist Manifesto"},{"id":"61745687","text":"Nikolai Grigorevich Dokashenko (; 21 November 1921 – 22 February 1992) was a Soviet fighter pilot who was credited as a flying ace in the Korean War with nine shootdowns. He is also credited with two aerial victories from World War II. Early life Dokashenko was born on 21 November 1921 to a peasant family in Kindrativka village, now Sumy Oblast, Ukraine. In 1939 he completed his ninth grade of school and studied at a local aeroclub. Just a few days before the start of Operation Barbarossa he entered the military, but did not see combat in World War II until June 1944; he graduated from the Chuhuiv Military Aviation School of Pilots in 1943 and was initially assigned to the 22nd Reserve Aviation Regiment. Eventually he was transferred to the 17th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which he flew with for the remainder of the war. While on the eastern front he flew 113 sorties on the P-39 and gained two aerial victories, and after the capitulation of Nazi Germany he regiment was transferred to the Far East, where he flew just three sorties on the P-63 during the short war with Japan. After the war he was promoted to flight commander and became a member of the Communist Party in 1947. Korean War Regiments of the 303rd Fighter Aviation Division were sent to Mukden, China in March 1951 in preparation for Soviet participation in the Korean war, and in June Dokashenko experienced his baptism by fire of the Korean war. In October he was promoted to captain and made commander of the 3rd squadron. The two previous commanders of the 3rd squadron had to be removed from their post for incompetence, and the squadron did not gain a single aerial victory until 18 August during a flight with the regimental commander, Grigory Pulov. Before his promotion, Dokashenko gained his first credited victory in Korea on the morning of 20 September, hitting an F-86. In October 1951 alone he was credited with five more aerial victories, becoming considered a jet ace. The identity of aircraft he shot down on 25 October was disputed due to the low quality of the film showing the event, but it was narrowed down to either a F6F-5 or F4U-4. Not long after that, he was credited with shooting down three F-86 on the afternoon of 28 October. Korean war veteran Douglas K. Evans recalled a heavy dogfight from that day in his book, Sabre Jets over Korea: a Firsthand Account. Historian Igor Seidov indicated that it is likely that Dokashenko and his wingman were the MiGs described by Evans. After the incident in October he did not score any more aerial victories until 11 December, followed by his last two victories in January and February 1952 respectively. During the conflict he flew over 150 sorties, engaged in 45 dogfights, and was credited with nine aerial victories. Postwar Shortly after his return to the Soviet Union he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1955 he was promoted to assistant commander of flight and tactical training in his regiment, and in April 1958 he became the deputy flight commander. He then became the head of the Kurgan DOSAAF aeroclub before retiring with the rank lieutenant colonel in 1960. He lived in Sumy where he worked with the Sumy Regional Committee of DOSAAF before he died on 22 February 1992.

The party, founded by Matteo Salvini and other Lega members on December 2017, is the sister party of Lega Nord (LN) for central Italy and southern Italy. Lega per Salvini Premier represents the interests of Lega outside of its politically dominated areas in the North and so largely replacing the purpose of Us with Salvini. Description Lega per Salvini Premier describes itself as the following; \\"Lega per Salvini Premier is a confederal political movement constituted in the form of an unrecognized association whose purpose is the peaceful transformation of the Italian state into a modern federal state through democratic and electoral methods. Lega per Salvini Premier promotes and supports the freedom and sovereignty of peoples at European level.\\" However political commentators describe the party as a parallel of Lega that serves to represent Lega voters in Central and Southern Italy. The logo is a dark blue rectangle featuring the name of the party, the logo resembles that of the promotional material for the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign. History Lega per Salvini Premier was founded in December 2017 by Lega politicians; Matteo Salvini, Lorenzo Fontana, Giancarlo Giorgetti, Giulio Centemero and Roberto Calderoli to represent Central and Southern Italy. Since 2018, membership recruitment by Lega in the Centre-South has been made under the name of \\"Lega per Salvini Premier\\" (LSP), practically supplanting Us with Salvini. Officials of the League claimed that the creation of LSP was also due to \\"judicial reasons\\". The LSP, whose statute had been published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale in December 2017 and had been described as a \\"parallel party\\", might eventually replace both the LN and NcS, which would be merged into one. In the meantime, the parties' joint parliamentary groups have been named \\"Lega–Salvini Premier\\" in the Chamber and \\"Lega–Salvini Premier–Sardinian Action Party\\" in the Senate. According to news sources, Salvini might even launch a brand-new party and absorb most of the centre- right parties into it. In 2019 Lega per Salvini Premier was accepted into the European political party, Identity and Democracy Party. Other members of the ID Party include LSP's parallel party, Lega along with National Rally, Vlaams Belang, Freedom Party of Austria and Freedom and Direct Democracy.
