Like most Shakespearean fools, the Gravediggers are peasants or commoners that use their great wit and intellect to get the better of their superiors, other people of higher social status, and each other. The Gravediggers appear briefly in Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, making their only appearance at the beginning of Act V, scene i. They are first encountered as they are digging a grave for the newly deceased Ophelia, discussing whether she deserves a Christian burial after having killed herself. Soon, Hamlet enters and engages in a quick dialogue with the first Gravedigger. The beat ends with Hamlet's speech regarding the circle of life prompted by his discovery of the skull of his father's beloved jester, Yorick. Detailed summary The penultimate scene of the play begins with the two clowns digging a grave for the late Ophelia. They debate whether she should be allowed to have a Christian burial, because she committed suicide. This quickly leads them into a discussion of the impact of politics on the decision, and the two parody lawyer speech. They present Ophelia's case from both positions: if she jumped into the water, then she killed herself, but if the water effectively jumped on her, then she did not. The First Gravedigger laments the fact that the wealthy have more freedom to commit suicide than the poor. The pair get off the subject of suicide almost as quickly as they began it, however, and soon begins the more witty section of their scene. The First Gravedigger begins to goad and test the Second, beginning by confusing him with the double meaning of the word \\"arms\\" (as in weapons and appendages). The dialogue between the two ends when the First Gravedigger is unsatisfied by the answer to the riddle \\"What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?\\" (V.i.39‚Äì40) that the Second Gravedigger gives, and consequently sends him off to bring back alcohol. \\"Hamlet, Horatio, and the Gravediggers\\" by Eug√®ne Delacroix. The Second Gravedigger exits as Hamlet and Horatio enter, and the First Gravedigger begins to sing a song on the topics of love and graves as he digs. He throws a skull (and later a second) up and out of the grave. Hamlet then talks to Horatio about how inappropriate it is to treat what used to be someone's, and possibly an important someone's, body in such a way. He decides to ask the Gravedigger whose grave he is digging, but the Gravedigger will not reveal the answer without another witty exchange. Soon, it is revealed that the Gravedigger has been digging graves since the day Hamlet was born. The two then briefly discuss Hamlet's insanity (which they are able to do because the Gravedigger does not know Hamlet by sight). It is shortly thereafter that the Gravedigger points out a skull that used to belong to Yorick, the king's jester and Hamlet's caretaker. Hamlet asks if this could really be so, and the Gravedigger responds with, \\"E'en that,\\" (V.i.159), marking his last line in the play. Jokes When together, the Gravediggers speak mainly in riddles and witty banter regarding death, with the first asking the questions and the second answering. Gravedigger What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? Other The gallows-maker, for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. (V.i., 38‚Äì41) And later in the scene: Gravedigger And when you are asked this question next, say ‚ÄúA grave-maker.‚Äù The houses that he makes last till doomsday. (V.i., 53‚Äì55) Songs While digging Ophelia's grave, the first Gravedigger sings to himself: Gravedigger In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet To contract‚Äìo‚Äìthe time, for‚Äìa‚Äìmy behove, Oh, methought, there‚Äìa‚Äìwas nothing‚Äìa‚Äìmeet. (V.i.57‚Äì58) Gravedigger But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch, And hath shipped me into the land As if I had never been such. (throws up a skull) (V.i.63‚Äì64) Gravedigger A pickax and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet, Oh, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. (throws up another skull) (V.i.95‚Äì98) Note: this song is full of reworkings or misquotes from Thomas Vaux, 2nd Baron Vaux of Harrowden's poem. \\"The Aged Lover Renounceth Love\\" https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50280/the-aged- lover-renounceth-love  Analysis of the scene  Many important themes of the play are discussed and brought up by the Gravediggers in the short time they are on stage. The manner in which these themes are presented, however, is notably different from the rest of the play. While the rest of the play is set solely in the fictional world of Hamlet's Denmark, this scene helps make sense of the themes by simultaneously bringing the focus to the audience's world. \\"By using recognizable references from contemporary times, the clown can, through the use of the oral tradition, make the audience understand the theme being played out by the court-dominated characters in the play.\\" For example, although the First Gravedigger is definitely in the fictional world of the play (he is digging Ophelia's grave), he also asks his fellow to \\"go, get thee to Yaughan, fetch me a stoup of liquor\\".Hamlet, Act V, Sc i, line 61 This does not appear in all versions and means little to us now, but it is \\"generally supposed that [Yaughan] was a nearby inn-keeper [to the theatre]\\".The New Temple Shakespeare \\"Hamlet\\", J.M. Dent & Sons Ltd, 1938, London. Notes, p.184 Likewise, the First Gravedigger is in the same world as the English audience of the time when he jokes \\"...[insanity] will not be seen in [Hamlet] there [in England]; there the men are as mad as he\\".Hamlet, Act V, Sc i, line 155 This gives enough of a distance from Elsinore [for the audience] to view what the clowns say as discreet parallels, not direct commentaries. The literal graveness of the situation (the funeral) subsides to the humor. This makes it possible for the characters to look at the subject of death objectively, giving rise to such speeches as Hamlet's musings over the skull of Yorick. The tone is set from the opening of the scene, during the Gravediggers' dialogue regarding Ophelia. Simply, they use her death to debate whether suicide is legitimate and forgivable according to religious law. This is not the first time, however, that this question has been raised in the play. Hamlet has the very same discussion with himself during his \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy in Act 3 scene 1. The characters in Act 5 scene 1 approach the topic this time with dark comedy, and in doing so bring up an entirely different theme. The parody of legal jargon used by the pair of clowns continues the theme of the corruption of politics, as seen in the usurpation of the throne by Claudius (which should have belonged to prince Hamlet) upon King Hamlet's death. The disintegration of values, morals, and order is a theme discussed at length in \\"Hamlet\\". The colloquial tone of the Gravediggers brings this philosophy into the focus of the audience's world. The synthesis of all perspectives used ends in a greater comprehension of the play as a whole. Because Hamlet was written in the midst of England's Reformation, the role of religion was a contentious topic. However, Shakespeare was able to address religion and its relationship to suicide through Hamlet, discussing the legality of suicide through characters that have their own intention (i.e. to dig a grave) understood as separate from the author's intention.Bakhtin, M.M.

These included a flag of red and white stripes and a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national symbols were replaced by Soviet- era symbols in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two symbols, along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national symbols of Belarus.  Law  In the 1994 Constitution of Belarus, Article 19 lists the official symbols of the country. Article 19 reads: Each national symbol is further defined by their respective laws. Uses of the national symbols are covered in the relevant law of each symbol.  National flag  National flag The national flag has been in use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position. The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies were based on the national flag. Despite being replaced, the former flag of Belarus is used by those who oppose current Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Webpage showing photos of the white-red-white flag being used by the group Zubr The former flag consisted of a white background with a red horizontal stripe in the middle. It was used by the Belarusian People's Republic and immediately after independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.  National emblem  National emblem The other national symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum was the national emblem. The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in the colors of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At the base of the ribbon, it says the country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the ribbon was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages. The national emblem that was used at the time of the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base of a red shield, an armored white knight is mounted on a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.  National anthem  The only symbol that hasn't changed over during independence is the national anthem. Adopted during the Soviet era, \\"My Belarusy\\" was used provisionally until 2002. The only change that occurred was dropping the Soviet-era lyrics and choosing just to use the music, composed by Nyestar Sakalowski. On July 2, 2002, President Lukashenko issued a decree adopting new lyrics to the anthem, written by Uladzimir Karyzny. Klimkovich also wrote the lyrics to the Anthem of the Byelorussian SSR. Not only the lyrics were chosen, a protocol guide related to the national anthem was released by Lukashenko. The reason that was given for keeping Sakalowski's music was to keep the historic traditions of the country. While references to Lenin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the idea of Soviet brotherhood were dropped, the general idea of a \\"friendship of peoples\\" still remains present. According to the Belarusian Government, once the national anthem was adopted, the long process to adopt the three national symbols of Belarus was completed.

Ren√© Perron, \\"De Germain Doucet √† Jacob Bourgeois\\", Soci√©t√© historique acadienne, Cahiers, Vol. 23, No. 1 (October‚ÄìDecember 1991) and \\"Bourgeois et Doucet : √† Bassevelle, des suites surprenantes\\", Soci√©t√© historique acadienne, Cahiers, Vol. 23, No. 1 (January‚ÄìMarch 1992), pp. 27-46. (most likely Coubron northeast of Paris, France) was a French commander in the French colony of Acadia. Doucet's career began when he entered into an association with Charles de Menou d'Aulnay, noted seaman, captain, and future governor of Acadia. In 1632, he arrived in Acadia with the governor Isaac de Razilly. He served as master of arms of Fort Pentagouet (now Castine, Maine) as a major. After the death of d'Aulnay in 1650, Doucet became commandant serving at the French fort of Port Royal (now Annapolis Royal). Under Major General Robert Sedgwick, the English captured the fort on August 15, 1654. Under the terms of the surrender, Doucet was forced to leave Acadia for good, and returned to France. Both his son Pierre, and his daughter Marguerite stayed behind, however. Pierre married, in 1660, Henriette Pelletret, by whom he had issue. Marguerite married Abraham Dugas.Acadian Genealogy Homepage The name of Germain's wife is uncertain, although some genealogists suggest she may have been Marie Bourgeois.

The campus master plan, as well as eleven of its buildings, are important late designs of architect Bernard Maybeck, best known for his influential architecture in the American West. The Principia was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993.,. and was also placed on the National Register of Historic Places that same year. Description and history The Principia was founded in 1897 as an educational institution primarily serving the needs of Christian Scientists. Beginning with primary and secondary schools, the organization (unaffiliated with the Church of Christ, Scientist but operating with its approval) established Principia College in the early 20th century. Initially based in St. Louis, Missouri, the organization in the 1910s began to search for a suitable campus location for the college. A former country estate overlooking the Mississippi River just south of Elsah was purchased, and college president Frederic E. Morgan hired West Coast architect, Bernhard Maybeck, to develop the campus master plan and buildings. Maybeck used the existing roads on the estate as a foundation, and laid out what resembles an English country village. The centerpiece of the campus is the chapel, which was the first permanent building of the campus. It was built in 1931-34 in Maybeck's conception of an American Colonial Revival structure, with a limestone exterior. Most of the other buildings Maybeck designed have steel frames and use concrete extensively inside, but have exteriors of stone, brick, and timbering. In the later phases of the campus construction, the onsite work was supervised by Henry Gutterson, who also contributed designs for several of the buildings. One architectural oddity on the campus is what is called the \\"Mistake House\\", which was used as a design and materials test vehicle by Maybeck.

It could wirelessly connect PCs to an Ethernet fixed LAN at a speed of up to 512kbit/s, over a very wide area. It was a micro-cellular system, in which each base station had an effective range of about 100m indoors, 300m outdoors, and the system supported seamless handover between base stations. The system was based on the DECT standard, published in 1992. A prototype system was first demonstrated at the Telecom '91 show in Geneva in October 1991, and is believed to be the first public demonstration of the DECT transmission system. The product was launched in June 1993, and was the first product based on the DECT standard to reach the market, narrowly beating Siemens' highly successful Gigaset cordless telephone. It is also believed to be the first wireless LAN to be sold on the European market. In its first version, the adapter cards consisted of half-size PC cards connected to an external desk-seated radio unit of modest dimensions. The second version, launched at Telecom '95, consisted of a PCMCIA card and a small external radio unit suitable for portable use. thumb The system was developed in the laboratories of Olivetti Sixtel, the telecommunications technology division of Olivetti in Ivrea, Italy. At a time when knowledge of commercial digital radio technology was scarce in Italy, the group began research in 1988 and developed in-house a high level of capability in DECT technology, including patented technology that became fundamental to the standard.International patent describing the DECT synch word The development was funded partly from corporate venture resources, partly from ESPRIT funding, and partly from an unusual but highly effective tool of industrial policy, invented by Ing. Augusto Vighi of the Istituto Superiore delle Poste e Telecomunicazioni. Vighi placed a contract for proof-of-concept DECT demonstration systems with a consortium of Italian technology companies, covering the full range of DECT applications. This accelerated the development not only of the Net3 wireless lan by Olivetti, but of the FIDO public system by Italtel and of a complete wireless PABX by SELTA. Net3 was originally conceived as a means to substitute LAN cabling in problematic buildings, which are especially numerous in the historic centres of Italian cities. In practice this was not a fast-growing or eager market, and the product eventually instead found success when integrated with rugged portable computers on forklift trucks in large warehouses and stockyards. A system was also installed inside a steel works and worked reliably despite the very high levels of electrical interference. The team developing Net3 was also deeply involved in the development of the DECT standards, and contributed the chairmen of the DECT standards groups that designed the DECT network protocols and the data transport and interworking protocols. As a result, the DECT standards contained a high level of standardised, embedded support for wireless LAN functionality. The product benefited greatly from the availability of dedicated spectrum (1880-1900 MHz)throughout Europe thanks to a European directive on DECT, and from a single-stop type approval process arising from DECT's status as a pan-European standard. Although a very leading-edge product, Net3 was nevertheless able to exploit the availability of early semiconductor devices designed and priced to meet the mass consumer market for DECT-based cordless telephones. In 1995 Olivetti cancelled all its commercial telecommunications products as part of its strategy of transformation into a telecoms operator. The Net3 product was progressively withdrawn from the market. The technology was repurposed to work as a high performance, low cost wireless local-loop infrastructure, supporting both toll-quality voice and broadband internet access. A pilot system was built and operated in Ivrea. The approach eventually floundered on the difficulty of redistributing signals within the apartment blocks so prevalent in the Italian urban fabric, and the Net3 team was eventually disbanded in 1997.

His pre-episcopal life is not very well documented, but when he was provided to the bishopric of Ross in 1398, he already possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (i.e. canon law) and bore the title Archdeacon of Ross.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 89; Watt, Dictionary, p. 562; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 385-6. It is not known for how long he had held the latter title, but it could have been as early as August 1376, when the last known archdeacon Alexander Man was made Bishop of Caithness.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 285. It was on 17 August 1398, that Avignon Pope Benedict XIII provided Waghorn to the vacant diocese of Ross; the papal mandate of provision informs us that Alexander had been elected by the cathedral chapter to the vacant see, but that because the Pope had previously reserved the see for his own appointment, declared the election invalid. However, \\"to prevent a long and harmful vacancy\\" he nevertheless provided Waghorn as bishop.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 89. There is a papal mandate, dated 4 May 1404, in which three churchmen are told to confirm one clerk named William de Tayn (\\"of Tain\\") as Chancellor of Ross because William de Tayn \\"doubted the validity of his presentation and institution by Alexander, bishop of Ross\\".McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 120. A similar mandate for confirmation, this time issued to the Bishop of Moray (Henry de Lichton) and dated 16 August 1417, was as a result of similar concerns, this time in relation to one John de Kylwos, regarding Kylwos' exchange of the Ross subdeanery for the treasurership, an exchange authorised by Bishop Alexander.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 360. On 30 June 1407, a papal mandate was issued to the Bishop of Dunkeld and the Bishop of Caithness to receive Alexander's oath of fealty to the papal see, and to ensure that a copy of the oath was sent to the papal court by letters patent under Alexander's seal.McGurk (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 164. This is somewhat of a long period since his provision, and may be explained if some of the secular authorities were opposing his provision.Watt, Dictionary, p. 562. At this time, there was a power struggle over the province of Ross, the notable participants being Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross, and ally to the Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany; Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles, a magnate based on the western coast who was pressing his own claim to the earldom; and Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, husband of the deceased Countess of Ross, Euphemia I. It is possible that Waghorn was a prot√©g√© of one of these men and, if he was, the most likely candidate is the Earl of Buchan, namely because he is found witnessing a number of charters of Isabella, Countess of Mar, wife of Buchan's illegitimate son, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Bishop Alexander witnessed, at Kildrummy Castle in 1404, Isabella's deed handing over her rights to Buchan's son. He was at Perth on 18 July 1408, where he attended an ecclesiastical council and witnessed a deed. He can be found at St Andrews on 4 and 6 February 1414, attending the ceremonies celebrating the receipt of the papal bull which authorised the founding of the University of St Andrews; Bishop Alexander made a sermon on 6 February.Dowden, Bishops, p. 216; Watt, Dictionary, p. 562. He is found for the last time at Perth on 17 March 1416, witnessing a transumpt made by an ecclesiastical council. It is not known when he died, but the earliest secure date is 14 February 1418.Watt, Dictionary, p. 562; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 368. Notes References * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed.

The CR-Z is successor to the second generation Honda CR-X in both name and exterior design. In the U.S., the CR-Z is one of the least polluting vehicles available and is rated as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) as defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The CR-Z is the third gasoline- electric hybrid model offered by Honda (after the 2000‚Äì2006 Insight and 2003‚Äì2005 Civic Hybrid) that can be equipped with a manual transmission, and the only in its class. The CR-Z is the sixth unique version of Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) technology since the technology was first launched in the first generation Insight 3 door hatchback. Sales of the CR-Z began in Japan in February 2010. Sales in the U.S. began in August 2010, and production ended by the end of 2016. History The design and production of the CR-Z followed two other Honda hybrid concept cars: the Honda Remix, introduced at the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show, and the Honda Small Hybrid Sports, introduced at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. The Honda CR-Z was introduced as a concept vehicle on October 23, 2007 at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. Honda said the name \\"CR-Z\\" stood for ‚ÄòCompact Renaissance Zero‚Äô ‚Äî reflecting the idea of a renaissance in the design of compact cars. At the show, CEO Fukui stated that a production model is \\"in the works\\" and that the car was intended to be \\"sporty, incredibly efficient and inexpensive\\". The CR-Z was first shown in America at the 2008 Detroit North American International Auto Show. Honda Future Models+Concepts, In the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda displayed a revised \\"CR-Z Concept 2009\\". In January 2010, Honda introduced the production CR-Z at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. At its introduction in 2010, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award. Automotive News reported in June 2010 that since its debut at the Detroit Auto Show, the CR-Z Web site had had 1 million hits. Honda promoted the 2011 model from the Facebook game Car Town. The car was also featured in the music video for the Jason Derulo song Ridin' Solo. Safety CR-Z models have received an average rating for side crash safety, an excellent (5 out of 5 stars) rating for rollover, and a 4 out of 5 star rating for frontal crash safety for 2012 and newer model. The 2011 model has an average frontal crash safety rating (3 out of 5 stars). Development The project leader, Norio Tomobe, worked previously as chief engineer on Mobilio Spike and Elysion. The basic concept of the CR-Z is to create a fun-to-drive sports car with driving characteristics of a Honda. In a video, Torikai, the chief chassis engineer of CR-Z, explained that during the development process ‚Äúthis car was brought to Europe at each prototype stage to be tested under various road conditions to evaluate whether the desired performance had been achieved.‚Äù Norio Tomobe believes the hybrid element will make it a sports car without guilt. Powertrain Engine bay of a Honda CR-Z. The CR-Z is powered by a i-VTEC SOHC inline-4 engine, designated as LEA, with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid-electric system. A six-speed manual transmission is standard equipment and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is available. The system delivers a combined peak output of at 6000 rpm and at 1000 to 1500 rpm ( on CVT-equipped models). The gasoline engine contributes at 6000 rpm and at 4800 rpm. An early road test of a Japanese-market CR-Z resulted in 0‚Äì100 km/h in 10.5 seconds and the quarter mile in 17.6 seconds. Inside Line performed the same 0‚Äì100 km/h test in 8.8 seconds, and Motor Trend, in 8.3 seconds. On November 21, 2012, Honda released the 2013 CR-Z to the United States market, which other than minor cosmetic changes, included a more powerful electric motor (from 10 to 15 kilowatts), and a new, higher voltage (144V), 0.6 kWh lithium ion battery pack. The 2013 CR-Z delivers a combined peak output of 130 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 140 pound-feet of torque (127 pound-feet on CVT- equipped models), a gain of eight horsepower and 12 pound-feet of torque (4 pound-feet on CVT equipped models). A new Plus Sport System is standard. If the battery is more than 30 percent charged and the CR-Z is traveling over 18 mph, the driver can press the \\"S+\\" button on the steering wheel to deliver increased acceleration for up to five seconds. Manual-transmission versions also receive both a larger clutch and a new lower final drive ratio. EPA-rated fuel economy figures increased by 1 mpg city for CVT equipped models, and 1 mpg highway for those with the six-speed manual transmission. Fuel economy Japanese fuel economy ratings are for CVT and for MT in 10‚Ä¢15 mode; and for CVT and for MT in JC08 mode. The 2011 CR-Z U.S. EPA ratings are for city and for highway with manual transmission. The model with CVT transmission has a rating of for city driving cycle and for highway. Beyond U.S. EPA estimates, among drivers reporting real-world fuel economy the CR-Z averages nearly 39 mpg overall. When comparing fuel economy to the CR-Z's older cousin, according to fueleconomy.gov, the 1988 gasoline-powered Honda CR-X HF had an EPA rating of city driving, and highway driving. The CR-Z is ranked number four on 2011 EPA top ten list of fuel efficient vehicles for CVT equipped model and number ten for manual transmission equipped model. Price and sales by region =Japan= Sales of the CR-Z began in Japan on August 24, 2010 at a starting price of million (~) before any government subsidies. Honda announced that in less than one month it had received orders for more than 10,000 vehicles, far exceeding its sales forecast. As of the end of August 2010, more than 19,000 CR-Z were delivered and sales orders received are three times higher than expected, which led to Japanese media comparing its success with the NSX in the 1990s, another sports car from Honda. In an interview in early February 2011, a Honda executive disclosed that Honda produces around 200,000 hybrids a year in Japan. =North America= Sales in North America started on February 26, 2010. The 2011 CR-Z was offered in three trim levels: base, EX, and EX with navigation. The base CR-Z starts at , the CR-Z EX starts at and the EX with navigation trim is priced at . The CR-Z pricing was similar to the now discontinued Honda Insight and had a lower price than the market leader Toyota Prius. After its launch in late August 2010, there were 3,349 Honda CR-Z sold as of end of October, 2010. It ranked as the fourth most sold hybrid in the U.S. for September and October of that year. U.S. sales for year 2010 reached 5,249 units, and ranked 11th in hybrid sales for that year. For year 2011 cumulative sales of the CR-Z in the U.S. reached 9,635 units through August, ranking number four in hybrid sales in 2011 and outsold only by the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Honda Insight, and Toyota Prius. In addition to commercials airing during sporting events, Honda held a marketing competition available to universities throughout the United States. This competition allowed students to create public relations and social media campaigns for the vehicle. A team from Syracuse University won first place in the competition, followed by runners-up New England School of Communications and University of LaVerne. =Europe= The CR-Z was launched in the European market in mid-2010 after having been revealed at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. =South Africa= Sales in South Africa were scheduled to begin on the 30 August 2010. =Malaysia= The CR-Z was launched for the Malaysian market on November 3, 2011, which made it the first in Southeast Asia to offer the three-door hybrid. Within a month, Honda has received over 300 orders, over three times its target. The introduction of the CR-Z was a result of the 2012 Malaysian Budget that extended the full import duty and excise duty exemption to imported hybrid vehicles and electric cars to 31 December 2013. The 6-speed manual model has been offered, with plans to bring in the CVT version in 2012; in addition to white, three more colours will be offered by early 2012.http://paultan.org/2011/12/12/honda-cr-z-well-received-three-new-colours- available/ Honda CR-Z well received, three new colours available =Australia= Honda announced that it would being importing the CR-Z in mid-2011 after showing the car at the 2011 Australian International Motor Show in June but the launch was delayed by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The CR-Z was finally launched in December 2011 with a based price of A$34,990 plus on-road costs in two grades: Sport and Luxury. Grades were identical except that Sport was only available with manual transmission while Luxury was only available with CVT automatic transmission and the addition of satellite navigation and glass roof. In January 2015 Honda announced that it was cease selling the CR-Z in Australia citing rationalisation of its hybrid model lineup but the CR-Z did not sell strongly in the Australian market with only 86 reported sales in 2014. =New Zealand= It was launched in New Zealand in December 2011.http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/motoring/road- tests/6436536/Honda-hybrid-unlike-any-other-before-it Honda hybrid unlike any other before it =Indonesia= Introduced in Indonesia International Motor Show 2012 in September 2012, the CR-Z was launched in February 2013. Honda CR-Z was the third hybrid car released in Indonesia after Toyota Prius and Toyota Camry Hybrid. Transmission is offered in 6-speed manual or CVT automatic. =Philippines= Honda Cars Philippines Inc. introduced the CR-Z hybrid coupe to the Philippine market in August 2013. The Honda CR-Z is offered in three variants; a standard trim, Modulo, and Mugen. =Pakistan= Honda Atlas Cars (Pakistan) Limited introduced the CR-Z hybrid coupe to the Pakistani market in December 2013 with a price tag of Rs.3,269,000 for the manual transmission and Rs. 3,419,000 for the Automatic. An additional Rs. 80,000 is charged for the Pearl/Metallic Colors only. =Sri Lanka= Honda CRZ was launched in Sri Lanka the same time it was launched in Japan Refresh In 2016, the Honda CR-Z received a minor refresh. It received a change to the front and rear bumper, as well as a slightly revised interior. It also gained the EX-L trim from the refresh with a small increase in price. The base price LX trim starts at $20,295 with a manual transmission, and $20,945 with a continuously variable transmission or CVT. The EX trim increased to $22,140 with a manual transmission, and $22,790 with a CVT. The new EX-L trim starts at $24,440 with a manual transmission, and $25,090 with a CVT. The refresh has changed a few colors as well. The North Shore Blue Pearl color changed to the Aegean Blue Metallic color, the Crystal Black Pearl color has changed to the Jet Black color, and Premium White Pearl has changed to Ivory Pearl. On the EX trim, the secondary interior red color has changed to orange. The CR-Z also gained a few new wheel designs for the refresh. Honda had previously confirmed that a second generation of the CR-Z was under development, possibly for the 2018 model year. Discontinuation On June 17, 2016, Honda announced that the CR-Z will be discontinued at the end of the year to make room for the Accord Hybrid and Clarity. Racing Two Honda Performance Development CR-Z Racers entered the 25-hour of Thunderhill endurance race held on December 4‚Äì5, 2010 at Willows, California.

This is what the hybrid engine could withstand in terms of power. =CR-Z Mugen= Honda CR-Z Mugen at the 2010 Australian International Motor Show. A sportier and quicker variant called the CR-Z Mugen came with plenty of aftermarket parts from Honda's Motorsport division, Mugen. Parts include an Aero Package, a tweaked sports suspension, a special glossy black grille with daytime running lights, a triangular sports exhaust, carbon fiber shift knob, a set of 17-inch bronze/silver wheels in 7-spoke and minor interior cosmetic bits. The car is powered by a 1.5-liter engine which has been equipped with a supercharger and a revised ECU. Thanks to these tweaks, the hybrid is rumored to have 178 hp (133 kW / 180 PS) instead of the concept's 197 hp (147 kW / 200 PS). This enables the car to accelerate from 0‚Äì60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.1 seconds before hitting a top speed in excess of 130 mph (209 km/h). The CR-Z Mugen was slated to be launched early 2012 with a base price of approximately ¬£23,000 ($35,820 / ‚Ç¨26,780). =CR-Z Mugen RZ= CR-Z Mugen RZ (Japan) Honda's Motorsport Division Mugen has announced plans to offer a high-performance Honda CR-Z in Japan. Production was limited to 300 units. Dubbed the Mugen RZ, the model features an aerodynamic body kit with a front spoiler, a revised grille and modified side skirts. It also features a rear diffuser, an adjustable wing and a sports twin exhaust system. Other highlights include an adjustable suspension, high-performance brakes and 17-inch alloy wheels. The cabin has two-tone seats, a carbon fiber gear knob, a boost meter and an individually- numbered plaque. Power is provided by a supercharged 1.5-liter engine that produces 156 HP (115 kW) and 185 Nm (136 lb-ft) of torque. It is backed up by an IMA hybrid system that develops 20 HP (15 kW) and 78 Nm (58 lb-ft) of torque.

Deposits of lime are also located in Makareao and accordingly a limeworks operates.Holcim New Zealand, \\"Taylor's Lime\\" , accessed 13 October 2007. In 1990, Taylor's Lime opened a new plant at Makareao replacing one formerly operated at Weston.About Holcim - Holcim New Zealand  Transport  No major roads pass through Makareao. State Highway 85 passes through Dunback on the other side of the Shag River from Makareao. From 1900 until 1989, Makareao was the terminus of a short branch line railway. On 29 August 1885, a branch had been opened to Dunback from a junction with the Main South Line in Palmerston, but to provide better access to the lime deposits, a sub-branch was built from Inch Valley to Makareao. Together, the two lines were known as the Dunback and Makareao Branches and the Makareao portion served solely the limeworks; it did not carry passengers or general freight. It was just under 4 km long and opened on 31 March 1900.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 88. The terminus in Makareao was a modest affair, with just loading bins for the lime and a loop to hold 26 wagons.Patrick Dunford, \\"Dunback & Makareao Branches\\" , accessed 13 October 2007. On 1 January 1968, the Dunback portion of the branch closed and the 11 km section between Palmerston and Inch Valley operated solely to carry Makareao lime. The demise of the line was sudden. Trains ran thrice weekly to carry the lime to a Dunedin-based cement factory, and when this factory closed in 1988, the reason for the line's existence disappeared. The line was formally closed on 1 June 1989, but railway remnants remain at the Makareao terminus and the line's disused formation can still be seen between Makareao and Inch Valley.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 89.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Hetzel, a sidewheel steamer, was built in 1861 at Baltimore, Maryland, for the U.S. Coast Survey and was transferred to the Navy Department 21 August 1861. Her first commanding officer was Lt. H. K. Davenport.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Hetzel was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and arrived Newport News, Virginia, 18 November 1861. Her first taste of action came 2 December, when Confederate steamer Patrick Henry stood out into Hampton Roads and engaged several Union gunboats, including Hetzel. The Federal ships succeeded in damaging Patrick Henry in a 2-hour engagement.  North Carolina operations  The ship was next sent to the coast of North Carolina to participate in a series of successful moves by joint forces in that area. Arriving 4 January 1862 off Hatteras Inlet, Hetzel got underway with the fleet 5 February for the joint amphibious assault on Roanoke Island. She took part in the initial bombardment of the Confederate works 7 February, and, after the landing of troops under cover of naval guns, helped to consolidate the Union victory next day. Commander Rowan's forces quickly capitalized on their important victory by pursuing the retreating Confederate squadron up the Pasquotank River. At Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Hetzel and the other ships engaged Confederate batteries and destroyed or captured five Southern gunboats 10 February as Union forces strengthened their hold on the sounds of North Carolina. As the joint operations in North Carolina continued. Hetzel took part in the attack on New Bern, 13 and 14 March 1862. Getting underway and steaming up the Neuse River at night, the gunboats under Commander Rowan supported the landings by Army and Marines at the town, passed obstructions in the river, and carried troops for the occupation. This combined operation behind the big guns of the Navy captured the key depot at New Bern with a veritable arsenal of supplies. Hetzel was assigned to the sounds of North Carolina following this victory, and spent much of the rest of the war on blockading duty in that area. She participated in an expedition to Hamilton, North Carolina, and Williamston, North Carolina, 2‚Äì9 November 1862 to look for ironclads rumored to be building by Confederates in the area, but found none. In March 1863 the ship assisted in the defense of Fort Anderson, opposite New Bern, when it was threatened by Confederate troops. They attacked 13‚Äì14 March and the accurate fire of Hetzel, Hunchback and other gunboats was credited with saving the fortification from capture.  End-of-war operations  Hetzel was active in the sounds of North Carolina, at New Berne and Washington, until November 1864. She acted during this time as command ship for the area, as her commander was senior officer of the sounds. During the course of the war she shared in the capture of five steamers, six schooners, and one sloop, as Union blockaders effectively shut off the Confederacy from outside trade. Hetzel returned to Hampton Roads in November 1864 for much- needed repairs, sailing for North Carolina and her former blockading station again 29 May 1865.  Hetzel returned to the U.S. Coast Survey  She finally returned north in October 1865 and was returned to the Coast Survey during that month.

Like many other Cr(III) compounds, it has a quartet ground state. The complex is relatively inert toward substitution but undergoes bromination at the 3-positions of the chelate rings. Use in NMR The addition of small quantities of Cr(acac)3 to an NMR sample can allow for quantitative 13C NMR, i.e. accurate relative integrations of peaks. It achieves this by acting as a paramagnetic relaxation reagent which cancels out the Nuclear Overhauser effect, which can adversely effect the integration of 13C peaks.

Most live in the mountainous northern provinces of L√†o Cai, H√† Giang, Lai Ch√¢u, and Cao B·∫±ng. In 2019 the population was 67,858.  Language  The Gi√°y speak the Bouyei language, a member of the Tai language family. Literacy is low in their native language, however, most Gi√°y can also speak and write Vietnamese, which they learn in primary school.  Culture  The Gi√°y traditionally cultivate rice in paddy fields using simple technology. Water buffalo are raised as draft animals and are used to plow the land. Chickens and pigs are raised for food. Corn and cassava are also grown (sometimes on land too steep to use for rice cultivation) as feed for livestock. Gi√°y make their clothing from cotton. Women usually wear a brightly colored five-panel blouse which buttons under the right arm and features a contrasting collar and cuffs. Women also wear colorful plaid headscarves. Men traditionally wear simple tunics and turbans. Both men and women wear loose indigo trousers. Western dress is now common among many Gi√°y, especially men. Gi√°y society is patriarchal. Children carry the last name of their father. The eldest son in a family (or son-in-law if they have no sons) is responsible for caring for his parents; he continues to live in the family home even after he is married. Traditionally, the Gi√°y treated farmland as communal property. Although today it is becoming more common for each family to own a separate plot of farmland, planting and harvesting are still done as a community. On the snake day of the first lunar month, the Gi√°y celebrate Ro√≥ng Po·ªçc, a festival to mark the start of the rice season. They serve dishes called l·∫°p si·ªÅng and l√≤ n√πng. They sing v∆∞∆°ng and ph∆∞·ªõn.  Religion  The Gi√°y traditionally worship their ancestors, as well as animistic spirits that govern the heavens, the soil, the kitchen, and others. Each Gi√°y village has a grove called a ƒëoong x√≠a that is sacred. Offerings are made twice per year at the biggest tree in the grove, to ensure the favor of the spirit that governs over the village.

Activity as an informer In the early 1980s Fenton agreed to help the IRA and moved explosives from an arms dump to a safe house. He was then approached by officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch who said he could be prosecuted for the offence. The officers said if Fenton agreed to work for them as an informer he would not be prosecuted, and he would be paid in addition. After agreeing to a further meeting with the officers, Fenton tried to extricate himself from the situation by attempting to start a new life in Australia with his wife and four children.The Dirty War, p. 318. His immigration application was rejected by the Australian High Commission Consulate in Edinburgh, and Fenton started working as an informer for Special Branch in 1982. He started a new job as a salesman for an estate agent, and shortly after started his own estate agency named Ideal Homes based on the Falls Road. In his role as an estate agent Fenton had access to empty homes that were for sale, which he allowed the IRA to use as safe houses, arms dumps and meeting places for IRA leaders and active service units.The Dirty War, p. 319. Special Branch bugged the houses using covert listening devices, enabling them to gather intelligence in order to try to prevent IRA attacks. Over twenty IRA members were arrested in possession of firearms, and several IRA bombing units were arrested as they travelled to targets. A Special Branch officer said of Fenton: > Joe devastated the IRA in west Belfast in the mid-1980s. I was told he loved > his work and got a great deal of pleasure after operations were compromised. > He was a very willing agent and tried on at least two occasions to entrap > senior republicans. But it was probably only a matter of time before he was > caught out and by late 1988 he was under suspicion. Fenton had previously been under suspicion in 1985 following a series of compromised IRA operations.The Dirty War, pp. 324‚Äì325. The IRA's Internal Security Unit (ISU) began an investigation, but Fenton diverted suspicion away from himself by providing the names of two other informers, Gerard and Catherine Mahon who were husband and wife. The Mahons were interrogated by the ISU and confessed to informing, and were found shot dead in an alleyway in the Turf Lodge area on 8 September 1985. Fenton again came under suspicion in 1988 after four IRA members were arrested at a house in the Andersonstown area of Belfast which was being used as a mortar factory. Only a few people had knowledge of the location of the factory, and the ISU began a new investigation. As a result of the new investigation the ISU concluded there was a link between compromised IRA operations and homes provided by Fenton. Fenton's professional life was also investigated, and his sudden ability to start an estate agency business in the early 1980s could not be explained.The Dirty War, pp. 319‚Äì320. Fenton's handlers in Special Branch stopped paying Fenton when the IRA stopped using properties provided by him,The Dirty War, p. 321. and by the end of 1988 Ideal Homes was facing closure.The Dirty War, p. 320. By then Fenton was working as a taxi driver to supplement his income, and in early 1989 Ideal Homes ceased trading when the offices were closed by Fenton's landlord due to unpaid rent. England Former Force Research Unit operative Martin Ingram states that Fenton was taken out of Northern Ireland and transported to England by his handlers in Special Branch. Ingram states Fenton wanted to return to Northern Ireland, and asked for help from Andrew Hunter, an MP for the Conservative Party.Stakeknife, p. 234. Fenton returned to Northern Ireland, with Hunter stating \\"Special Branch told me that if he came home he would be killed very quickly. They warned me he was a marked man and that it was dangerous to be associated with him and I passed this on to him, but he still went back\\". According to Ingram, while back in Belfast Fenton continued to pass information to Special Branch, and in early February 1989 a planned IRA mortar attack was prevented and six IRA members were arrested. Author and journalist Martin Dillon states Fenton fled to England from Northern Ireland of his own accord, based on an interview with a senior IRA member with access to details of Fenton's court-martial.The Dirty War, pp. 321‚Äì325. Dillon states that Fenton was ordered to return to Northern Ireland by his handlers in Special Branch, and say he had gone to England to see a boxing match. According to the IRA, Special Branch knew Fenton faced execution if he returned and that he was deliberately sacrificed to preoccupy the IRA and divert suspicion from another informer operating within the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Death The IRA abducted Fenton on 24 February 1989, and took him to a house in the Lenadoon area of Belfast. He was interrogated by the ISU and confessed to working as an informer for Special Branch, and was court- martialled. Fenton was found dead in an alley in Lenadoon on 26 February 1989; he had been shot four times.Stakeknife, p. 238. The following day the IRA issued a statement that Fenton had been killed because he was a \\"British agent\\".The Dirty War, p. 316. In accordance with standard procedure the RUC denied Fenton had any connection with the police, while Fenton's father Patrick blamed the RUC for his son's death. The IRA had shown Fenton's written confession to his father, and Patrick Fenton stated: > Having seen and read evidence which was presented to me I accept his death > and wish to say that the position in which he was placed, due to pressures > brought to bear upon him by the Special Branch, led directly to the death of > my son. At Fenton's funeral the local priest, Father Tom Toner, criticised the role of Special Branch in Fenton's death stating: > The IRA is not the only secret, death-dealing agent in our midst. Secret > agents of the state have a veneer of respectability on its dark deeds which > disguises its work of corruption. They work secretly in dark places unseen, > seeking little victims like Joe whom they can crush and manipulate for their > own purposes. Their actions too corrupt the cause they purport to serve. Toner was also critical of the IRA's actions stating: > To you the IRA and all who support you or defend you, we have to say that we > feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul > and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. > What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have > done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. > The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, spreading death, killing > and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is > afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA > removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of > society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills > pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it > allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold- > blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.

The nature center is the largest urban wilderness preserve in the United States. The nature center is home to more than 370 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Over 220 species of birds reside or rely on the center as a safe resting-place on their migratory journeys. White-tailed Deer, Red-shouldered Hawk, Opossum, Crow, Armadillo, Coyote, Raccoon, American Alligator, Tricolored Heron and the rare Purple Martin can be found at the center and surrounding areas throughout the year. Armand Bayou Nature Center lies along the Central Flyway, the largest migratory bird route in North America. The center is part of the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail and one of the coastal preserves designated under the Texas Coastal Preserve Program of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.  History  The Armand Bayou area was once occupied by Native Americans, as evidenced by archaeological excavations that uncovered arrowheads, flints and pottery which identify it as a campsite for Nomadic Native American tribes such as the Attakapa, Cohuilletan and Karankawa. They likely hunted and fished in the area until the arrival of European settlers during the mid-19th century. The area was originally called the Middle Bayou and was settled by a small group of families during the mid-19th century. The settlers lived by hunting, fishing and growing produce, then selling it at the markets. At one point, a plantation existed on the banks of the bayou near Mud Lake called Killkare. Later residents of the Middle Bayou such as oilman Jim West took steps to ensure the land was protected and preserved by purchasing the homes owned by the early white settlers and protecting them as a game preserve. West owned 28,000 acres of land surrounding the bayou until 1930. The Humble Oil and Refining Company, now ExxonMobil, purchased the land for its natural gas and oil resources for $8,500,000 plus royalties. In 1962, 15,000 acres for residential development and 7,250 acres for industrial development were placed under the control of the Friendswood Developmental Company, a subsidiary of Humble Oil. Residential real estate development began in 1962, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used nearly 1700 acres of the West Ranch property to establish the Manned Spacecraft Center. After this came the development of Bay Area Boulevard in 1967, which cut through the middle of the Middle Bayou and became more accessible to the public. Prairie Tallgrass at Armand Bayou Nature Center Morning on Armand Bayou at the Nature Center One of 370 species of fauna at Armand Bayou Nature CenterWindmill & Cistern in transplanted early Texas farm at Armand Bayou Nature Center Armand bayou nature center entrance Local farmer Jimmy Martyn owned 28 acres of land that stood in the way of residential development, refusing a $500,000 offer from Friendswood until his death in 1964, when his heirs sold the property to Friendswood for development. The Armand Bayou Nature Center now houses a re- creation of a 19th century farm named Martyn Farm in his honor. Much of the Bayou remained natural, but the active preservation of the Bayou was sparked by the murder of Armand Yramategui, a leader in environmental preservation of Houston during the 1960s. Although Yramategui only visited the Middle Bayou a handful of times, the bayou was renamed to Armand Bayou in his memory after his tragic murder in a mugging on the Southwest Freeway in 1970. Yramategui, concerned about the increasing urban growth around Armand Bayou, worked to have the land remain a wilderness. Following Yramategui's death, conservationists worked hard against Friendswood Development Co. to preserve the Bayou. Biological surveys were conducted by biologist Norman Waldo from Rice University, who concluded the land would be ideal for nesting birds to remain indefinitely. Victor Emanuel of the Audubon Society said the region was \\"like a centerpiece on a table, it enhances the whole area.\\" Lawrence Dexter of the Texas Conservation Council said \\"[it] is important to preserve the vicinity of a city to show that the city and natural areas are compatible.\\" Fellow environmentalist and friend Hana Ginzbarg became the bayou's advocate for the Bayou Preservation Association. Her activism and work through the Bayou Preservation Association, Outdoor Nature Club, and other organizations was instrumental in creating the Nature Center. Founded in 1974, the center consists of a boardwalk through forest and marshes, live animal displays, bison and prairie platforms and butterfly gardens. The center also includes the \\"Martyn\\" \\"Karankawa\\" \\"Marsh\\" \\"Lady Bird\\" (named after Lady Bird Johnson) and \\"Prairie\\" nature trails that allow visitors to see forest, prairie, marsh and natural bayou habitats once common in the Houston and Galveston region.

The channel provides 24-hour live reports on traffic conditions and weather forecasts for the New York City metropolitan area, updated every 5 minutes. The channel is headquartered in Woodbury, New York. It is an affiliate of the News 12 Networks slate of regional cable news channels in the New York City area (each of which focus on areas outside of Manhattan and Queens, including the easternmost boroughs). News 12+ is carried on channel 61 on Altice USA systems in the region, and is also available on Verizon Fios and Comcast Xfinity in portions of the Hudson Valley region of upstate New York. Background The channel was launched in the 1980s News 12 Weather. The service originally aired each morning in place of Bravo and E!, as all three services had shared a channel slot on Cablevision's Long Island systems due to limited channel capacity at the provider's headends. Following the launch of Cablevision's Optimum TV service in 1996, News 12 Weather gained a full-time dedicated channel slot on the provider's systems. On August 5, 1998, the service was rebranded as MSG Metro Traffic & Weather and was rolled into the MSG Metro Channels slate (, it is the only channel that was a part of the original MSG Metro Channels slate that survives in operation); its format was also revised to include regular updates on traffic conditions in the New York metropolitan area. As a result, it became the first strictly local traffic and weather channel in the Tri-State area; although it faced competition for weather coverage via local broadcast stations and The Weather Channel, the traffic component was the feature that made the channel unique. In October 5, 2005, the channel was brought back in with the News 12 Networks slate of channels, accordingly being renamed News 12 Traffic & Weather.News 12 T&W; celebrating 15 years of Know Before You Go (2013) The channel launched high definition simulcast services of its five regional feeds in November 2012. In December 2013, News 12 Networks announced it would lay off eight of the channel's ten meteorologists and News 12 Traffic & Weather before a massive staff lay-off. The channel formerly had a full-time staff of 40 reporters and 10 meteorologists and 30 of its 40 traffic reporters; it also announced that the channels would broadcast in a semi-automated manner, with live reports only throughout the morning drive, unless significant traffic or severe weather conditions warrant extended coverage. Original News 12+ logo. Used until early 2020. In August 2019, Altice rebranded the network as News 12+ and expanded the programming to include short headline news stories, in addition to traffic and weather reports. Programming As with the rolling news- formatted channels under the News 12 umbrella, News 12+ is divided into five channel feeds available in different regions of the New York metropolitan area (New York City, New Jersey, Long Island, the Hudson Valley and Connecticut), which are centralcasted from News 12's headquarters in Woodbury. The channel maintains a staff of five part-time and several freelance traffic reporters, and two on-camera meteorologists.

Apparently it does not migrate or wander except possibly for dispersal of young. The (rather indefinite) boundary with the African goshawk is in western Uganda and the eastern and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Description Its wingspan is 18.4 to 20.3 cm (7.2 to 8.0 inches) in males, 20.4 to 24.3 cm (8.0 to 9.6 inches) in females. The length is about 3/5 of the wingspan. Males weigh 150 to 235 grams, females 170 to 265 grams. Though females of all birds of prey are bigger than males, this difference is much greater than usual. Adults' eyes, cere, and legs are yellow to yellow- orange. In the eastern subspecies, adults have dark gray upperparts with lighter heads. The underparts are plain rufous and white. The tail is blackish with two or three big white patches. Juveniles are more or less unmarked blackish above and white below. In the western subspecies, adults are also dark above, but have a grayish throat and barring mixed with rufous on the underparts. They have three white patches on the tail. Juveniles are blackish- brown above and white with heavy brown spotting below. The most common call is a \\"ventriloquial rasping krit or sharper whit\\" given regularly every 2 or 3 seconds. It is given when the bird is perched, especially at dawn, and in flight, and is used as a contact call between mates, in courtship, and for territorial advertising. The male gives a \\"quieter tchuck or krit\\" when bringing food to the nest. Other softer, less harsh calls are heard around the nest, maybe particularly from the female. Reproduction The breeding season begins in July or August and ends in February. Unlike the African goshawk, this species is said to perform flight displays only rarely. The nest is placed 6 to 20 meters above the ground in the main fork or on a side branch of a large tree, hidden by leaves or vines. It is built of sticks, 40 to cm across and 15 to 45 cm deep, with a lining of fresh leaves. The female lays 2 or 3 eggs (less often 1 or 4). As in most Accipitridae, the female incubates and cares for the young while the male supplies the food, with the female doing some of the hunting after the young are half-grown. Incubation lasts some 4 or 5 weeks, and the young fledge in 32 to 36 days. Juveniles probably molt directly into adult plumage when a little over one year old. Feeding This species' main foods are frogs and freshwater crabs. It takes more large insects than the African goshawk, and also eats lizards, earthworms, and small mammals and birds. It hunts throughout the day, including dawn and dusk. Among its methods is waiting hidden in the forest canopy, often near an open space such as a trail or a body of water. It also flies quickly from tree to tree looking for prey that it can swoop down on or snatch, and flies beside lines of dense vegetation to surprise prey by flying through. Conservation status This species is probably declining because of habitat loss but is fairly adaptable and is probably still common. Classification The two subspecies groups may be considered separate species, in which case the western one is called Accipiter macroscelides, the West African goshawk. More commonly, though, the present species is lumped with the African goshawk because the groups intergrade and vary widely within themselves and separated populations resemble each other. The red-chested goshawk is treated here as a separate species following the Handbook of the Birds of the World and other authorities., according to Etymology Des Murs and Verreaux named this species after Alphonse Toussenel in the hope of encouraging him to move toward serious studies of natural history.

He was sent to Stockholm in 1826 and came as secretary of embassy to St Petersburg in 1839. Five years later, he was promoted to envoy. In 1846, he succeeded his father as baron and in 1848, he was awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). Bloomfield was appointed ambassador to Berlin in 1851 and on this occasion was advanced to a Knight Commander (KCB). In 1858, he was further honoured as a Knight Grand Cross (GCB). He reached his highest post as ambassador to Vienna in 1860 and was sworn of the Privy Council. . He represented Britain at many official functions, helped organize international conferences, and gathered information on Austria- Hungary, Prussia and nearby smaller nations, sending daily reports to London. He supported the British policy of noninvolvement and saw the Emperor as essential to the balance of power and stability in continental Europe. On his retirement in 1871, he was created Baron Bloomfield, of Ciamhalltha in the County of Tipperary, this time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which enabled him to a seat in the House of Lords. He represented County Tipperary as a Deputy Lieutenant. Marriage and family On 4 September 1845, Bloomfield had married Hon. Georgiana Liddell, the 16th and youngest child of Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth and a former maid of honour to Queen Victoria. The couple had no children.

Built in New York City in 1862  During the later stages of the Taiping Rebellion, Shanghai local authorities contracted Henry Gamaliel Ward, brother of American mercenary Frederick Townsend Ward who had died in combat fighting for the Qing Dynasty earlier, to purchase 5 steamers. Henry Ward ordered the constructions of 3 steamers, one of them being Chih Kiang (), the other two being Dai Ching (later USS Dai Ching) and Kiang Soo (later USS Fuchsia). Instead of delivering the steamers to China, Ward re-sold them to the Union Navy. Chih Kiang was renamed Tulip in August. *  Civil War operations  = Assigned to the Potomac River Flotilla = Renamed Tulip and refitted for service as a tugboat and gunboat, the screw steamer joined the Potomac River Flotilla in August 1863. That force patrolled the river protecting Union waterborne communications between the nation's capital and the port cities of the divided nation during the Civil War. She initially performed towing duties at the Washington Navy Yard, and then served with the flotilla in operations against Confederate forces in the Rappahannock River. In the latter duties, the ship carried Federal troops and supported naval landing parties which from time to time went ashore for operations against Confederate traffic across the river. = Loss = Tulip memorial, St. Inigoes, Maryland As she continued this wartime riverine service into 1864, Tulip developed a defective starboard boiler. Commander Foxhall A. Parker Jr., commanding the Potomac Flotilla, ordered the ship home to the Washington Navy Yard so that repairs could be made to correct her defective propulsion plant. Tulip got underway on 11 November with orders restricting her steaming on the port boiler only. Not long after departing from St. Inigoes, Maryland, her engineers, against all orders, began supplying steam to the starboard boiler. When abreast Ragged Point (east of Ragged Point Beach), the boiler exploded and tore the fragile ship apart‚Äîkilling 47 men instantly‚Äîof the 57-man complement.

It is secreted in response to increased mean arterial pressure and increased blood volume from the cells of the distal tubule and collecting duct. It is important in oliguric patients (such as those with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney failure) as it lowers serum creatinine and increases urine output. Interactions Atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP-99-126) is a hormone system of clinical importance. Urodilatin (CDD/ ANP-95-126) is a homologue natriuretic peptide that differs from CDD/ANP-99-126, which is excreted into the circulation via exocytosis. The prototype of the natriuretic hormones is cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP). The endocrine heart is composed of specific myoendocrine cells that synthesize and secrete the natriuretic peptide hormones, which exhibit diuretic and vasorelaxant properties; secretion is the basis for a paracrine system regulating water and sodium reabsorption. Research efforts since the early 1980s have studied their effects on electrolyte homeostasis. When administered intravenously, urodilatin induces strong diuresis and natriuresis with tolerable hemodynamic side effects. Urodilatin is localized in the kidney, differentially processed (involved in the regulation of body fluid volume and water-electrolyte excretion, while circulating), and secreted into the urine. As a consequence, urodilatin is involved in drug development along with the prohormone CDD/ANP-1-126 and cardiodilatin CDD/ANP-99-126. A message for the preprohormone is transcribed in the heart and kidneys from the gene of NP type A, resulting in a cGMP-dependent signal transduction, which induces diuresis and natriuresis, differentially processed to a peptide of 32 amino acids from the same precursor as renal ANP, may not be identical to the circulating cardiac hormone ANP. The kidneys produce their own natriuretic 32-residue peptide. Urodilatin renal natriuretic peptide potency equals or exceeds that of Atriopeptin [ANP-(99-126)], the prototype of cardiodilatin. Atriopeptin is only of trivial importance in the regulation of sodium excretion during normal living conditions. Urodilatin is little affected by renal enzymes that inactivate atriopeptin, as the kidney elutes with urodilatin rather than with ANP. The degradation rates of (125I)-urodilatin and [125I]-ANP by pure recombinant NEP (rNEP) were compared. Phosphoramidon, a potent inhibitor of NEP, completely protected both peptides from metabolism by rNEP. Urodilatin has a four-residue extension at the N-terminus neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP) plays a physiological role in metabolizing atrial natriuretic peptide, and C-type natriuretic peptide (prohormone) degraded the bioactive peptides at about half the rate though the C-terminal that compete with natriuretic peptides for hydrolysis by neutral endopeptidase.

The original concept for the theatre grew out of political struggles, especially the land rights demonstrations which at the time were being organised by the Black Moratorium Committee. The centre held workshops in modern dancing, tribal dancing, writing for theatre, karate and photography, and provided a venue for new Aboriginal drama. It also ran drama classes under Brian Syron who conducted the first of a planned series of six- week full-time workshops for his students who included Jack Davis, Freddie Reynolds, Maureen Watson, Lillian Crombie, and Hyllus Maris. These people went on to become known in the Aboriginal community for their work in the Australian theatre and film industries. History = 1972 = Street theatre was organised by the Aboriginal community in Redfern by 1972 as a form of political action. Its value in publicising issues was used to support many protests and rallies in the early 1970s.

Participants included Euphemia Bostock, her daughter Tracey, Wayne Nicol, Norma Williams (Ingram), and Elsie and Joanne Vesper.Robinson p 26.

Funding Coe and Sheehan applied on behalf of 'Black Theatre' for funding from the Council of the Arts for training, to expand the drama workshops.Paul Coe interview in N'ingla a-na quoted by Casey, p 47 They were refused on the grounds of 'lack of expertise' and 'inexperience‚Äô. Other similar, equally inexperienced, groups received funding when they were formally established ‚Äì APG in 1970 and Nimrod in 1971. Casey outlines this as one of a number of obstacles they faced. In mid 1972 Bob Maza was invited to come to Sydney, to share his experience. He had set up Nindethana in Melbourne with Jack Charles, and had had a number of roles in television. A grant of $500 from the Council of the Arts went towards his train ticket and relocation costs.Bostock, Lester Black Theatre at Redfern Hindsight, ABC Radio Social History Unit, 1997. His 'professional' status did attract the funding that was needed. $5500 was granted by the Council of the Arts.Casey p 52 Maza had been to the United States in 1970 as part of a delegation to the Pan African Conference. He and Sol Bellear spent some time working and studying with the National Black Theatre of Harlem. Perhaps inspired by that, Redfern's National Black Theatre took shape.Eckersley. M.(ed.) 2009.

They rented a house at 174 Regent Street, and for workshops were given use of the hall named Murawina behind a church by Wayside Chapel and the Aboriginal Women‚Äôs Action Group who operated the children‚Äôs breakfast program. Maza ran the workshops when Coe and Sheehan had to resume their studies. When Johnson went to south- east Asia in September to continue her investigation of dance cultures, Phemie Bostock, assisted by Wayne Nicole, took over the co-ordination of the Dance Group.

What was needed next, was a performance space.Casey First National Seminar on Aboriginal Arts The first National Seminar on Aboriginal Arts was held in Canberra in May 1973, sponsored by the Aboriginal Arts Board of the newly formed Australia Council for the Arts. (The newly elected ALP had a commitment to the arts ‚Äì there was a substantial increase in funding and reorganisation of procedures enabling greater accessibility to resources, leading to independence of the Australia Council in 1975. The Aboriginal Arts Board had 15 Aboriginal members) Paul Coe, Brian Syron, Gary Foley, Oodgeroo Noonuccal, her grandson Denis Walker and other delegates discussed possibilities. A number favoured outreach work with mobile productions and workshops touring. Syron suggested a black theatre in each state, as a supplement, not replacement to traditional formsMcGuinness, Bruce A time to dream [film)] 1974, quoted by Casey A group presented a program of short sketches on topical issues.Australia Council for the Arts First annual report 1973 North Sydney: Australian Council for the Arts, 1974 p36 quoted by Casey Carole Johnson returned in November to take up a consultancy position with the Urban Theatre Committee (UTC), a sub-committee of the newly established Aboriginal Arts Board (AAB). This meant she worked more with helping to find a building for Black theatre than with dance workshops.Robinson p 48 For the first time, a theatre company used Aboriginal people to play Aboriginal people.

Roberta Flack and Rahsaan Roland Kirk were among the celebrities there. Singer Bettie Fisher had accepted the position to run the centre. She recruited Aboriginal theatre director, actor and teacher Brian Syron to work on setting it up. A huge empty former printing factory in Botany Street, Redfern, owned by the Methodist Church (Wesley Central Mission) was leased for $15,000 a year with very few conveniences.Kicking Down the Doors : A History of Indigenous Filmmaking 1968 ‚Äì 1993 : 29 The interior was a ghastly pale green, so early on it was repainted in cream, orange and brown, the paint having been donated by the local family paint company Pascols. With the help of friends such as Tom Hogan and Kevin Cook from the Builders' Labourers Federation, she renovated the old warehouse and developed a theatre and studio area. Born in Berry on the New South Wales south coast, Fisher was a well-known, respected and multi talented personality ‚Äì a cabaret entertainer for 16 years singing with Graeme Bell's Jazz Group. Fisher had also toured for 3 years with the Aboriginal band Black Lace and was on many Aboriginal service committees, including the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs. Her musical achievements in her short lifetime are quite remarkable when you consider that both Black Lace and Graeme Bell's Jazz Group are extremely highly regarded in the music world.Bettie Fisher Australian Dictionary of Biography By November 1974, it was up and running.A phoenix in Redfern. SMH 11 January 1975 A theatre provided seating for 100 in a semicircle built up on scaffolding, with cushions spread across.Black Theatre's debut SMH 13 January 1975 The focus was again on training and workshops.

For example, Peter Weir and some television producers did casting interviews there. The first play staged at the theatre, The chocolate frog, was written by non-Aboriginal Jim McNeil. While on the executive committee of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, Bettie Fisher had initiated its use as the subject of workshops conducted for inmates of Sydney prisons. (Year unknown)ADB Syron and Johnson worked on a workshop program to upgrade black theatre across Australia. Carole returned to the United States in May, but returned in 1975 committed to 'get dance on solid ground'. \\\\---- =1975= After sixteen months of lobbying the centre was given minimal government funding ($9200) from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. [ADB] Dance showcase A joint dance program with the Sydney dance group, and Queensland's Yelangi Dance Company and Torres Strait Island Dancers was presented in February, and a short performance on 6 April, to introduce funding bodies to the work being done by the Black TheatreRobinson p 60 The Cake Man The first serious play to be produced at the centre was The Cake Man, written in 1974 by Robert Merritt from Erambie Aborigines' Reserve\`, Cowra. Merritt wrote The Cake Man while he was in gaol and the play was then smuggled out of the gaol by the Prison Education Officer to the Australian National Playwrights Conference (ANPC). Katharine Brisbane and her husband Phillip Parsons, the founders of Currency Press, passed the text on to Bob Maza.Syron / kearney, \\" Kicking Down the Doors : A History of Indigenous Filmmaking 1968 ‚Äì 1993 \\" 31‚Äì32 . 36 In it Merritt expressed what he believed was at the root of Aboriginal despair. > \\"It is a poignant fragment of latter day mythology and a powerful Australian > play which traces white man's devastation of Blacks over the 200 years to > 1974\\" [Brian Syron]Syron / kearney Kicking Down the Doors: 31‚Äì32 > \\"about a Bible-loving mother and an alcoholic father, and how a small boy's > innocent faith transforms the life of a white Scrooge.

It was mainly cast in the Redfern community and starred Justine Saunders, Zac Martin, Teddy Phillips and an 8-year-old Lisa Maza, plus non-Aboriginal actors Max Cullen and Danny Adcock. Gerry Bostock tells how, during the performance of one scene in which a group is set upon by two white thugs, visitors from Elcho Island became incensed and tried to climb on to the stage to offer their assistance, yelling ‚ÄòI‚Äôll help ya, brother!‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôll come and save ya, cousin!‚ÄôAdam Shoemaker Aboriginality and Black Australian Drama in 'Black words, white pages; Aboriginal Literature 1929‚Äì1988‚Äô After initial refusal, Merritt was finally permitted to attend opening night under guard. The cast refused to go on stage until the handcuffs were removed. Lisa Maza presented him with a cake at the end. The play was a huge success with large Koori audiences attending. Casey stresses what an important milestone it was ‚Äì the first completely Aboriginal written, initiated, controlled, full length, professional, recognised production. Six week Training Program The first national performing arts training for Aboriginal people had a profound effect, on the participants, and as a catalyst for performing arts in Sydney. Syron and Johnson, as members of the UTC, devised a continuing training scheme ‚Äì to nurture new interests and new ideas, increase visibility and participation, and demonstrate the need for a permanent course or school. It was funded by the Commonwealth Department of Education and the Aboriginal Arts Board, and supported by the Black Theatre. 28 students were selected nationally through mini workshops held in the capital cities; Brisbane and Melbourne (Adelaide postponed). This 'travelling theatre' would also build networks. Syron taught drama, Johnson and Nicol taught dance, Ande Reese (aka Ande Evan Maddox) taught writing, Tom Rosser taught Karate.Robinson pp 60‚Äì74 The intensive six-week course took place at the Black Theatre in Redfern in June and July. Students included Maureen Watson, Jack Davis, Lillian Crombie, Andrew Jackamos, Hylus Maris, Wayne Nicol, Christine Donnelly, Aileen Corpus, Zac Martin, John Bayles, Lorraine Mafi. On the last night the group staged plays and dances they had written or choreographed. Over 300 people came from all over the country with no advertising.Haugh, How Bettie Fisher forced black theatre on the map quoted by Casey Syron met with Carole Johnson and Ande Reese to discuss the production of a film record of The Six Weeks Workshop because he believed that history was being made by all those involved and they needed to record the historic events to realise their value. Ande, like Carole, was an African American residing in Sydney, with experience in film and television production in the United States. She had been a screenwriting fellow at the American Film Institute, so she began work on a film (which would be completed in 1976).\\"Kicking Down the Doors ‚Äì A History of Indigenous Filmmaking 1968 ‚Äì 1993\\" Syron / kearney : 30 Outcomes After the six-week training program, people could for the first time see possibility of employment. Members of the dance group requested more specialised training, and a Careers in Dance course commenced in October. It moved to Bodenweiser Dance Studio in Chippendale, the breakaway causing some grief in the Redfern community. This was the forerunner of The Aboriginal / Islander Dance Theatre (AIDT) and The Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Scheme (AISDS), which evolved into the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA) in 1988,NAISDA History of the college; Dreamtime to dance and the offshoot Bangarra Dance Theatre in 1989. Christine Donnelly applied for a grant to continue dance workshops at the Centre, but was initially refused.Robinson p 77-78 In August, Johnson and Syron were terminated as consultants to the Aboriginal Arts Board (Urban dance and Urban Theatre), the only consultants for the UTC with experience in the performing arts. (Chicka Dixon was a member who became increasingly active.) While the dance group focused on further education, the drama group saw most of its students gain work. Many excelled in other areas of the performing arts as well. Yvette Isaacs was awarded a Conservatorium of Music scholarship. Known now as Maroochy Barambah, a successful musician, she has performed in leading roles and established a recording and publishing company Daki Budtcha.Maroochy Barambah in Australian Women Jack Davis developed as a playwright, Cheryl Stone became a booking agent, Maureen Watson became a well- known storyteller and started Radio Redfern. Christine Donnelly founded the Aboriginal Dance Theatre Redfern (ADTR) in 1979 to serve the Redfern community. Lucy Jumawan has worked there for many years as senior dance teacher. Performances Jack Davis presented for a performance his second one- act play, The Biter Bit.Casey p133 Bettie Fisher continued to invite touring international black artists to perform at the Black Theatre. Despite resistance by a number of non-Aboriginal entertainment managers, visitors included the band, Osibisa, and the Ghanaian drummers. =1976= A subscription season was planned of \\"black plays by black artists\\" including works by Gerry Bostock, Wole Soyinka, Ione elder and Archie Shepp.Aboriginal Black Theatre, subscription season brochure, 1976. Black Theatre Arts and Cultural Centre's Director Bettie Fisher died of coronary arteriosclerosis on 12 May 1976, still in her thirties. Funding withdrawn A proposed grant from the Federal government of $86,000Bettie Fisher ADB] for the 76‚Äì77 financial year was withdrawn in June 1976. (Dance and drama were funded separately.) The Board (under the new Liberal government) didn‚Äôt support the organisation, and was critical of Lester Bostock's appointment as Fisher's replacement.Casey p. 66. Ironically the Board was planning to spend $197,000 to send 30 Aboriginal performers to Nigeria to take part in the second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture. Marcia Langton believed that the difficulties faced by the black theatre in this period occurred because their work challenged the \\"accepted\\" expectations of Aboriginal people.Casey pp. 68‚Äì69. Justine Saunders agreed ‚Äì \\"challenging stereotypes, presenting real human beings dealing with conflict\\".Casey p. 109. Here comes the nigger To deal with the financial crisis a fundraising committee was established. The company used their limited resources to produce the play Here Comes the Nigger written by Gerry Bostock. This was the final production at the Redfern Black Theatre and Cultural Centre in 1976. It was directed by Jack Charles, then Bob Maza who withdrew for other commitments. It then became a cooperative affair with Gerry Bostock and Bryan Brown directing with the cast . The cast included Athol Compton, Kevin Stuart (Smith), Julie McGregor, Marcia Langton, Bryan Brown, Robert Hensley, John Bayles, Ron Murray, Lorraine Mafi Williams and Venieca Doolan.Casey p. 269. Marcia Langton, for example, was running the box office as a volunteer for NAISDA student performances at the centre, in between working for the Aboriginal Medical Service around the corner. This was the first occasion a profile was achieved outside the urban Aboriginal communities The play was successful ‚Äì they were starting to draw in a wider audience, often first-time visitors to Redfern, which helped to start to break down the barriers. Film: Tjintu Pakani ‚Äì Sunrise awakening Syron noted in Kicking Down the Doors that Tjinto-Pakani: Sunrise Awakening was completed, including footage of the first professional performance by Black Theatre's dance group under the direction of Carole Johnson in 1976. The film won first prize in the Greater Union Awards, documentary category, at the Sydney Film Festival in May that year. It also screened in Paris at L'Homme Regarde L'Homme, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and had a private screening at Universal Studios in Hollywood. A half-hour version was televised by the ABC. One of the items was the Embassy dance, performed this time with traditional movements.Bostock, Lester, \\"The Black Theatre\\" in GUWANYI; Stories of the Redfern Aboriginal community An exhibition at the Museum of Sydney 21 December 1996 ‚Äì 4 May 1997 reproduced in Redfern Oral History In an interview with Reese for a paper entitled \\"The Australian Film Commission\\" written in September 1977, Reese said that when she made Sunrise Awakening > Aborigines wanted to know why they couldn't make their own films about > themselves and how and what they were doing. They asked why films about > Aborigines were invariably made by the white middle classbriann kearney, > \\"The Australian Film Commission\\", 1977: 13. As Syron commented in his book Kicking down the doors, \\"We would ask that question for many years to come.\\" = 1977 = ABC TV made a television production of the play The Cake Man in 1977, making it the first telemovie to be written by an Aboriginal playwright. After its success, Merritt then tried to put on another stage production of the play with the director George Ogilvie who liked the play but saw it as a fresh challenge. The production opened at the Bondi Pavilion, Bondi Beach in Sydney on 30 April 1977Merritt, Robert, The Cake Man Currency Press, 1989 under Ogilvie's direction and starring Justine Saunders with Zac Martin and Brian Syron. It was the first Aboriginal play to enter the repertoire of the European Australian mainstream theatre. Syron's and Saunder's performances were both highly acclaimed.Casey p 118 Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced that cultural activities involving Aboriginal people would no longer be helped by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but would become the responsibility of the Australia Council. No funds were granted to the Council for its additional responsibilities. Lester Bostock recalled that the Theatre had applied to the Department and to the Australia Council for assistance but had received no reply.[Guwanyi] Lack of funding had become an enormous strain on the Theatre, and all involved. As Langton explained > With no grants for over a year, the burden of supporting the centre plus > making a living burnt people out .Langton, quoted by Casey By the end of 1977 the Black Theatre had closed.  Seeds sown for future growth  In 1979 Christine Donnelly, a participant in the six-week program, founded the Aboriginal Dance Theatre (ADTR) to serve the Redfern community. It is situated next to the Black Theatre site. In 1980 Bostock and Bryan Brown received Script development funding from the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission for a documentary to be made from Bostock's script Here Comes the Nigger. > Barbara Aylsen : You already have one project floating with Gerry Bostock. > Bryan Brown : The project with Gerry is the first concrete movement I have > made into another area. We worked together on a screenplay from Gerry's play > \\"Here Comes the Nigger\\" which I want to shoot. I haven't yet had the > opportunity to shoot it and I am still working out how I want to do it. In 1982 The Cake Man starring Justine Saunders, Graham Moore and Syron, and directed by Syron, was invited to the International World Theatre Festival in Denver, Colorado and played to packed houses receiving widespread acclaimBrisbane (despite bureaucratic and private company disinterest).This'll get 'em for sure ‚Äì An interview with Bob Merritt in Aboriginal Law Bulletin 1985 Merritt went on to become the first Aboriginal screenwriter to co-write a feature film \\"Running Man\\" (1982) and the first Indigenous screenwriter of feature film \\"Short Changed\\" (1986)Kicking Down the Doors ‚Äì A History of Indigenous Filmmaking 1968 ‚Äì 1993 : 125/157/165/505 In 1984 Bob Merritt set up the Eora Centre for the visual and performing arts in Redfern, offering young Aboriginal people a comprehensive education. He filmed it in Eora Corroboree In 1987 the First National Black Playwrights‚Äô Conference was held under the artistic directorship of Brian Syron, thanks to a push from people like Chicka Dixon, Gary Foley and Rhoda Roberts. Out of this came the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust (ANTT), established in Sydney in 1988. In 1988 Carole Johnson was a foundation member and first director of the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA). She played a major role in the training of Aboriginal and Islander dancers and actors in movement, dance and choreography. > I love it in the '90s how all these organisations get longer and longer > names. [Rhoda Roberts]Roberts, Rhoda A Passion for Ideas: Black Stage Third > Rex Cramphorn Memorial Lecture, Belvoir Street Theatre, Sydney, 23 November > 1997 NAISDA is based on an idea of Johnson's, where young people would be taught traditional dance from their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders while also studying a modern dance technique. Johnson also played a pivotal role in the establishment in 1989 of the Bangarra Dance Theatre. She was founder and foundation member of the theatre which began in the Police Boys Club, Pitt Street, Redfern. The Bangarra Dance Theatre performed their first professional performance in 1990 in Brian Syron's feature film Jindalee Lady, the first feature film to be directed by an Indigenous Australian.Syron / kearney, KDTD : 30 /306 Conclusion ‚Äì Impact The ABC radio program Hindsight summarised: > BlackTheatre had a profound impact on the Australian arts scene of today.

It was a blessing to a people. Moving on =The future of the site= The Black Theatre building was handed over to the Redfern Aboriginal community, to a group called the Organisation for Aboriginal Unity (OAU), after its closure as a theatre. The OAU consisted of members of all of the existing organisations and individuals at the time of forming (1975). The OAU and Charles Perkins wanted the site to be developed as a cultural centre for the Redfern community, but there were never any funds to redevelop the site. It then became a squat. As there are organisations that exist now that didn‚Äôt exist then, Wyanga (next door) being one and the Local Land Council another, the Aboriginal community established another organisation called the Redfern Aboriginal Authority, reforming late in 2004 following suggestions that the NSW Government planned to forcibly acquire land owned by Aboriginal people in Redfern's Block. National Indigenous Times When ATSIC was abolished in 2005, the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) took over the overseeing of the site, redeveloping it in 2008, liaising with Sol Bellear, Redfern Aboriginal Authority's CEO. The ILC sought expressions of interest from Aboriginal businesses and organisations in the arts, multimedia, retail and/or hospitality. Koori Radio moved in and set up a recording studio. =The future of black theatre= In 2007 a new black theatre group formed in Redfern: Moogahlin Performing Arts was formed in November 2007 by a group of Indigenous theatre artists, educators and community workers in honour of Kevin Smith's request and in memory of the founding members of the Black Theatre. In 2012 The Black Theatre's origins were commemorated in the Sydney Festival's Black Capital program.

Background and recording Spring was largely tracked in Brian Wilson's home studio in Bel Air, California from October 8, 1971 to May 1972, engineered by Stephen Desper. The track for \\"Good Time\\" was sourced from an outtake from the Beach Boys' album Sunflower and was recorded on January 7, 1970. The album was produced by Wilson, Desper, and David Sandler, but the record itself only credits the production to Wilson.  Release and reception  Spring was released in the US by United Artists in July 1972. Elsewhere, and on later reissues of the album, the record was renamed \\"American Spring\\" to avoid confusion with the English band of the same name. The album was critically acclaimed but sold poorly. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote of the album: \\"In which Brian Wilson produces his old female backup group‚Äîthe Honeys, featuring his wife Marilyn‚Äîin what sounds like the best and is certainly the most charming Beach Boys album since Sunflower. The old combination of ingenuousness and sophistication works as well as ever, only this time the vocals rather than the lyrics are naive‚Äîdirect, pretty, effortless, thoughtless. And Wilson's studio work is as precise and humorous as ever.\\" Track listing  Personnel  American Spring * Diane Rovell * Marilyn Wilson  References  Bibliography *  External links  * Category:1972 albums Category:Albums produced by Brian Wilson Category:United Artists Records albums ","title":"Spring (American Spring album)"},{"id":"13703866","text":"Jack 'Jock' Cordner (9 June 1910 ‚Äì 14 September 1996) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Footscray, Fitzroy and North Melbourne in the VFL.

Beginning Waterson was the scion of a family of publishers: his grandfather Richard and his father Simon were both in the book trade. Simon Waterson (1585-1634) was also the brother-in-law of William Ponsonby, the prominent publisher of Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney; when Ponsonby died in 1604, Simon acquired many of Ponsonby's copyrights. John Waterson became a \\"freeman\\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 27 June 1620, and soon after was an active independent publisher. He took over the management of his father's shop, at the sign of the Crown at Cheap Gate in St. Paul's Churchyard. (Simon Waterson is thought to have gone into semi-retirement when his son took over, though his name appeared on published books until his death.) The younger Waterson continued to publish some of his father's works; Simon Waterson issued the first four editions of William Camden's Remains of a Greater Work Concerning Britain (1605, 1614, 1623, 1629), and John printed the fifth and sixth editions (1636, 1637).Daly, Peter Maurice, Leslie T, Duer, and Anthony Raspa, eds.The English Emblem Tradition. Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1988; p. 7. Simon published the first edition of an anonymous English translation of Guarini's Il Pastor Fido (1602), and John published the second edition (1633).Chambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage. 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 4, pp. 40-1. One of John Waterson's earliest publications was also one of his most notable: the first quarto of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (1623), printed by Nicholas Okes.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 510. Maturity John Waterson also published a noteworthy and problematic entry in the Shakespeare canon: The Two Noble Kinsmen (1634), printed by Thomas Cotes.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 226. The title page of the quarto attributes the play to Shakespeare and Fletcher, an attribution that inspired three centuries of controversy before its general acceptance in the modern era. Other first editions of plays published by Waterson include: * Sir William Davenant's The Cruel Brother (1630), printed by Augustine Matthews; * Davenant's The Just Italian (also 1630), printed by Thomas Harper; * Philip Massinger's The Renegado (also 1630), printed by Matthews; * Massinger's The Emperor of the East (1632), printed by Harper; * Fletcher and Massinger's The Elder Brother (1637), in partnership with John Benson, printed by Felix Kingston; * Fletcher's Monsieur Thomas (1639), printed by Harper; * Massinger's The Unnatural Combat (1639), printed by \\"E.G.\\" (Waterson maintained a close professional relationship with printer Thomas Harper; they worked together on many projects, including the Camden editions noted above.) Waterson also had a connection with Ben Jonson; he entered Jonson's play The Staple of News into the Stationers' Register on 14 April 1626. For unknown reasons, the play was not published at that time, and Waterson transferred his copyright to Robert Allot on 7 September 1631. Waterson published works beyond the confines of drama; he issued poetry, with volumes that included: * Michael Drayton's The Muses' Elysium (1630), printed by Harper; * Samuel Daniel's The Whole Works in Poetry (1635), printed by Thomas Cotes. And Waterson produced the normal range of miscellaneous books typical of stationers in his era, including religious works like Anthony Stafford's The Female Glory, or the Life and Death of the Holy Virgin Mary (1635), and popular fiction like The Tragedy of Alceste and Eliza (1638) -- both printed by Harper. End Waterson apparently retired from business after 1641. In October 1646 he transferred his copyrights to The Two Noble Kinsmen, The Elder Brother, and Monsieur Thomas to Humphrey Moseley. The shop at the sign of the Crown passed to stationer John Williams; John Waterson's son, another Simon Waterson, served his apprenticeship under Williams in the 1640s. This younger Simon Waterson was active in the book trade in the middle 1650s, doing business at the sign of the Globe in Paul's Churchyard.Plomer, Henry Robert.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 8,086 and it contained 3,646 housing units. It is the largest of the six townships in the county. History The Miami people were the first occupiers of Cicero Township. Upon early white settlement, the Miami resided on reservation land in what was then known as Hamilton County. On January 15, 1844, that reservation land became a part of Tipton County. The Miami were forced to leave the County, resulting in the Potawatomi Trail of Death.Pershing, p. 82 The majority of white settles in Cicero Township were from Southern Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Squatters were abundant in the area prior to land being available to purchase, which began in 1838.Pershing, p. 84 Settlement was sporadic in Cicero Township due to land that was \\"flat and low and would be difficult to drain,\\" according to white settlers.Pershing, p. 85 Geography According to the 2010 census, the township has a total area of , all land. =Natural landscape= Reports from the early 20th century state that despite being very flat and hard to drain, Cicero Township had lands with the finest agricultural potential \\"in the state.\\" Historically, the area had plentiful oak, walnut, beech and ash trees, but most of the trees were cut for lumber in the late 19th century. Deer, squirrels, wild turkey, raccoons, mink, possum, and muskrats were plentiful during this time, too. Black bears were common near Cicero Creek.

Also located on Cicero Creek, the mill was conveniently located at the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad Company stream crossing. The mill sawed timber and processed wheat and corn. Benjamin Bailey built a mill, which was horse powered, in 1850. Bailey allowed any farmer who wanted to grind their own corn to use the mill and horse. George Kane and Newton J. Jackson built a saw mill, which ran on steam, in 1851. The land where they built the steam saw mill is known as Jackson Station. Cicero Township's economy grew after the completion of the railroad to Peru, Indiana, which connected Peru to the Wabash and Erie Canal, in 1854. Another steam mill was built, by Thompson Innis, in 1854 at Parker's Mill (also called Parker's Corner).Pershing, p. 89 Education =Early history= The first school was founded in West Kinderhook by Silas Blount in 1842.

He was a founding board member of the Brown University Entrepreneurship Program. He was also member of the Weehawken, New Jersey Hall of Fame. Massarsky first owned and operated an artist management company handling artists such as The Allman Brothers Band and The Wailers, and is responsible for launching the career of Cyndi Lauper. He next operated an entertainment law practice with such diverse clients as Nintendo, The Wailers, Cabbage Patch Dolls, the Psychedelic Furs, Collins Management, Aerosmith, Tom Chapin and Willie Mays. Massarsky next co-founded Voyager Communications in 1989, with Valiant Comics growing into the third largest comic book publisher in the United States behind only Marvel Comics and DC Comics during the comic boom of the 1990s. The company was later sold to Acclaim Entertainment, with Massarsky remaining on as President and Publisher of the resulting Acclaim Comics. He died from complications of cancer on October 5, 2007, aged 59.

Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with Greek philosophy of the pre-Socratics such as Thales (c. 624 ‚Äì c. 546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570 ‚Äì c. 495 BC), and eventually covering a large area of the globe.Kenny, Anthony, A New History of Western Philosophy, chapter 1.Gottlieb, Anthony, The Dream of Reason: A History of Western Philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance, 1st Edition, chapters 1 and 2. The word philosophy itself originated from the Ancient Greek philosoph√≠a (œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±), literally, \\"the love of wisdom\\" (œÜŒπŒªŒµ·øñŒΩ phile√Æn, \\"to love\\" and œÉŒøœÜŒØŒ± soph√≠a, \\"wisdom\\").  Ancient  The scope of ancient Western philosophy included the problems of philosophy as they are understood today; but it also included many other disciplines, such as pure mathematics and natural sciences such as physics, astronomy, and biology (Aristotle, for example, wrote on all of these topics). = Pre-Socratic period = The pre- Socratic philosophers were interested in cosmology; the nature and origin of the universe, while rejecting mythical answers to such questions. They were specifically interested in the arche (the cause or first principle) of the world. The first recognized philosopher, Thales of Miletus (born ca. 625 BCE in Ionia) identified water as the arche (claiming \\"all is water\\"). His use of observation and reason to derive this conclusion is the reason for distinguishing him as the first philosopher. Thales' student Anaximander claimed that the arche was the apeiron, the infinite. Following both Thales and Anaximander, Anaximenes of Miletus claimed that air was the most suitable candidate.Ionia, source of early Greek philosophy, in western Asia MinorPythagoras (born ca. 570 BCE), from the island of Samos off the coast of Ionia, later lived in Croton in southern Italy (Magna Graecia). Pythagoreans hold that \\"all is number\\", giving formal accounts in contrast to the previous material of the Ionians. The discovery of consonant intervals in music by the group enabled the concept of harmony to be established in philosophy, which suggested that opposites could together give rise to new things. They also believed in metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, or reincarnation. Living around the time of Anaximander and Pythagoras, Xenophanes was an atheist, rejecting the Greek gods and arguing for a naturalistic interpretation of the world. A possible student of Xenophanes, Parmenides argued that, unlike the other philosophers who believed the arche was transformed into multiple things, the world must be singular, unchanging and eternal, while anything suggesting the contrary was an illusion. An opposite view was presented by Heraclitus, who claimed that everything was in flux all the time, notably noting that one could not step into the same river twice. The adopted son and lover of Parmenides, Zeno of Elea formulated his famous paradoxes in order to support the former's views about the illusion of plurality and change (in terms of motion), by demonstrating them to be impossible. Empedocles may have been an associate of both Parmenides and the Pythagoreans. He claimed the arche was in fact composed of multiple sources, giving rise to the model of the four classical elements. These in turn were acted upon by the forces of Love and Strife, creating the mixtures of elements which form the world. Another view of the arche being acted upon by an external force was presented by his older contemporary Anaxagoras, who claimed that nous, the mind, was responsible for that. A final alternative view of the fundamental nature of the universe was offered by Leucippus and Democritus, who argued in favor of atomism. Like Parmenides, they accepted the idea that the world was eternal and unchanging, while also defending pluralism by arguing that these could be the properties of the building blocks which compose the many things that exist. On Zeno's arguments against infinite divisibility, they accepted them by arguing that atoms could not be further divided. Jonathan Barnes called atomism \\"the culmination of early Greek thought\\". The sophists represented the last group among the pre-Socratic philosophers. As teachers of rhetoric who taught students to win the debate on any side of an issue, they were not representative of specific views but would generally argue in favor of subjectivism and relativism. In this spirit, Protagoras claimed that \\"man is the measure of all things\\", suggesting there is no objective truth. This was also applied to issues of ethics, with Prodicus arguing that laws could not be taken seriously because they changed all the time, while Antiphon made the claim that conventional morality should only be followed when in society. Bust of Socrates, Roman copy after a Greek original from the 4th century BC =Classical period=  Socrates  A key figure in Greek philosophy is Socrates. Socrates studied under several Sophists but transformed Greek philosophy into a branch of philosophy that is still pursued today. It is said that following a visit to the Oracle of Delphi he spent much of his life questioning anyone in Athens who would engage him, in order to disprove the oracular prophecy that there would be no man wiser than Socrates.West, Thomas G., and Platon. Plato's Apology of Socrates: an interpretation, with a new translation. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1979. In this, Socrates used a critical approach called the Socratic method to examine people's views. He aimed to study issues of human life: the good life, justice, beauty, and virtue. Although Socrates wrote nothing himself, his disciples Plato and Xenophon wrote down some of his conversations. He was tried for corrupting the youth and impiety by the Greek democracy, and was found guilty and sentenced to death. Although his friends offered to help him escape from prison, he chose to remain in Athens and abide by his principles. His execution consisted of drinking the poison hemlock and he died in 399 BC.  Plato  Plato was a student of Socrates. Plato founded the Academy of Athens and wrote a number of dialogues, which applied the Socratic method of inquiry to examine philosophical problems. His philosophy comprises a coherent system of thought, with all of the components intended to give answers to different questions which were interrelated. In order to understand the good life, Plato followed Socrates who had identified virtue with knowledge, leading to the questions of epistemology on what knowledge is and how it is acquired. Following Parmenides, he believed that the sense are illusionary and could not be trusted to this end. He illustrated this point with the allegory of the cave. Instead, knowledge had to be sourced from eternal, unchanging and perfect objects, which he believed to exist in a different realm, leading to the theory of forms. Alfred North Whitehead claimed that \\"Philosophy is footnotes to Plato\\".  Aristotle  Aristotle in The School of Athens, by Raphael Aristotle was a pupil of Plato. Aristotle was perhaps the first truly systematic philosopher and scientist. He wrote about physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, politics and logic. Aristotelian logic was the first type of logic to attempt to categorize every valid syllogism. Aristotle tutored Alexander the Great, who in turn conquered much of the ancient world at a rapid pace. Hellenization and Aristotelian philosophy exercised considerable influence on almost all subsequent Western and Middle Eastern philosophers, including Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Western medieval, Jewish, and Islamic thinkers. =Hellenistic period = Following Socrates a variety of schools of thought emerged. In addition to Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Peripatetic school, other schools of thought derived from Socratic philosophy included the Academic Skeptics, the Cynics, the Cyrenaics, the Stoics, and the Neoplatonists. In addition, two non-Socratic schools derived from the teachings of Socrates' contemporary Democritus flourished, Pyrrhonism and Epicureanism. = Roman period = Roman philosophy was heavily influenced by the traditions of Greek philosophy. Thorough study of Greek philosophy was first introduced by Cicero. In Imperial times Epicureanism and Stoicism were particularly popular, especially the latter, as represented by the works of Seneca the Younger and Marcus Aurelius. Roman Philosophy (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)  Medieval  Saint Augustine was the greatest philosopher of the early Middle Ages St. Anselm of Canterbury is credited as the founder of scholasticism. St. Thomas Aquinas, painting by Carlo Crivelli, 1476 Medieval philosophy roughly extends from the Christianization of the Roman Empire until the Renaissance. Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of Abrahamic religion (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity) with secular learning. Early medieval philosophy was influenced by the likes of Stoicism, Neoplatonism, but, above all, the philosophy of Plato himself. Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of faith to reason, the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and metaphysics, the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation. The prominent figure of this period was Augustine of Hippo (one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity) who adopted Plato's thought and Christianized it in the 4th century and whose influence dominated medieval philosophy perhaps up to end of the era but was checked with the arrival of Aristotle's texts. Augustinianism was the preferred starting point for most philosophers (including Anselm of Canterbury, the father of scholasticism) up until the 13th century. The Carolingian Renaissance of the 8th and 9th century was fed by Church missionaries travelling from Ireland, most notably John Scotus Eriugena, a Neoplatonic philosopher. The modern university system has roots in the European medieval university, which was created in Italy and evolved from Catholic Cathedral schools for the clergy during the High Middle Ages. Thomas Aquinas, an academic philosopher and the father of Thomism, was immensely influential in Catholic Europe; he placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. Philosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers Augustine of Hippo, Boethius, Anselm, Gilbert de la Porr√©e, Peter Abelard, Roger Bacon, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham and Jean Buridan; the Jewish philosophers Maimonides and Gersonides; and the Muslim philosophers Alkindus, Alfarabi, Alhazen, Avicenna, Algazel, Avempace, Abubacer, Ibn Khald≈´n, and Averroes. The medieval tradition of scholasticism continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as Francisco Su√°rez and John of St. Thomas. Erasmus is Credited as the Prince of the Humanists  Renaissance  Bronze statue of Giordano Bruno by Ettore Ferrari, Campo de' Fiori, Rome The Renaissance (\\"rebirth\\") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought, in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.Frederick Copleston, A History of Philosophy, Volume III: From Ockham to Suarez (The Newman Press, 1953), p. 18: \\"When one looks at Renaissance philosophy ‚Ä¶ one is faced at first sight with a rather bewildering assortment of philosophies.\\"Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, Renaissance Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: \\"one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read.\\" The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as humanism.Frederick Copleston, A History of Philosophy, Volume III: From Ockham to Suarez (The Newman Press, 1953), p. 29: \\"The bulk of Renaissance thinkers, scholars and scientists were, of course, Christians ‚Ä¶ but none the less the classical revival ‚Ä¶ helped to bring to the fore a conception of autonomous man or an idea of the development of the human personality, which, though generally Christian, was more 'naturalistic' and less ascetic than the mediaeval conception.\\" Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed Petrarch in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy. At the point of passage from Renaissance into early/classical modern philosophy, the dialogue was used as a primary style of writing by Renaissance philosophers, such as Giordano Bruno.James Daniel Collins, Interpreting Modern Philosophy, Princeton University Press, 2015, p. 85. How much of Renaissance intellectual history is part of modern philosophy is disputed.Brian Leiter (ed.), The Future for Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.  Modern  The term \\"modern philosophy\\" has multiple usages. For example, Thomas Hobbes is sometimes considered the first modern philosopher because he applied a systematic method to political philosophy. By contrast, Ren√© Descartes is often considered the first modern philosopher because he grounded his philosophy in problems of knowledge, rather than problems of metaphysics. Portrait of Ren√© Descartes, after Frans Hals, second half of 17th century Portrait of John Locke, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1697 Modern philosophy and especially Enlightenment philosophy is distinguished by its increasing independence from traditional authorities such as the Church, academia, and Aristotelianism;Steven Nadler, A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy, 2008, pp. 1‚Äì2: \\"By the seventeenth century [‚Ä¶] it had become more common to find original philosophical minds working outside the strictures of the university‚Äîi.e., ecclesiastic‚Äîframework. [‚Ä¶] by the end of the eighteenth century, [philosophy] was a secular enterprise.\\"Anthony Kenny, A New History of Western Philosophy, vol. 3 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. xii: \\"To someone approaching the early modern period of philosophy from an ancient and medieval background the most striking feature of the age is the absence of Aristotle from the philosophic scene.\\" a new focus on the foundations of knowledge and metaphysical system-building;Donald Rutherford, The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 1: \\"epistemology assumes a new significance in the early modern period as philosophers strive to define the conditions and limits of human knowledge.\\"Kenny, A New History of Western Philosophy, vol. 3, p. 211: \\"The period between Descartes and Hegel was the great age of metaphysical system-building.\\" and the emergence of modern physics out of natural philosophy.Kenny, A New History of Western Philosophy, vol. 3, pp. 179‚Äì180: \\"the seventeenth century saw the gradual separation of the old discipline of natural philosophy into the science of physics [‚Ä¶] [b]y the nineteenth century physics was a fully mature empirical science, operating independently of philosophy.\\" = Early modern (17th and 18th centuries) = Portrait of David Hume, by Allan Ramsay, 1754 Some central topics of Western philosophy in its early modern (also classical modern)Jeffrey Tlumak, Classical Modern Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction, Routledge, 2006, p. xi: \\"[Classical Modern Philosophy] is a guide through the systems of the seven brilliant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers most regularly taught in college Modern Philosophy courses\\".Richard Schacht, Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant, Routledge, 2013, p. 1: \\"Seven men have come to stand out from all of their counterparts in what has come to be known as the 'modern' period in the history of philosophy (i.e., the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries): Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant\\". period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and God, and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy.Kenny, A New History of Western Philosophy, vol. 3, pp. 212‚Äì331. These trends first distinctively coalesce in Francis Bacon's call for a new, empirical program for expanding knowledge, and soon found massively influential form in the mechanical physics and rationalist metaphysics of Ren√© Descartes.Nadler, A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy, pp. 2‚Äì3: \\"Why should the early modern period in philosophy begin with Descartes and Bacon, for example, rather than with Erasmus and Montaigne? [‚Ä¶] Suffice it to say that at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and especially with Bacon and Descartes, certain questions and concerns come to the fore‚Äîa variety of issues that motivated the inquiries and debates that would characterize much philosophical thinking for the next two centuries.\\" Other notable modern philosophers include Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.Rutherford, The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy, p. 1: \\"Most often this [period] has been associated with the achievements of a handful of great thinkers: the so-called 'rationalists' (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz) and 'empiricists' (Locke, Berkeley, Hume), whose inquiries culminate in Kant's 'Critical philosophy.' These canonical figures have been celebrated for the depth and rigor of their treatments of perennial philosophical questions...\\"Nadler, A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy, p. 2: \\"The study of early modern philosophy demands that we pay attention to a wide variety of questions and an expansive pantheon of thinkers: the traditional canonical figures (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), to be sure, but also a large 'supporting cast'...\\" Many other contributors were philosophers, scientists, medical doctors, and politicians. A short list includes Galileo Galilei, Pierre Gassendi, Blaise Pascal, Nicolas Malebranche, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Christiaan Huygens, Isaac Newton, Christian Wolff, Montesquieu, Pierre Bayle, Thomas Reid, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Adam Smith, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The approximate end of the early modern period is most often identified with Kant's systematic attempt to limit metaphysics, justify scientific knowledge, and reconcile both of these with morality and freedom.Kenny, A New History of Western Philosophy, vol. 3, p. xiii.Nadler, A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy, p. 3. = Late modern (19th-century) = Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, steel engraving, after 1828 Arthur Schopenhauer Late modern philosophy is usually considered to begin around the pivotal year of 1781, when Gotthold Ephraim Lessing died and Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason appeared.Karl Ameriks, Kant's Elliptical Path, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 307: \\"The phenomenon of late modern philosophy can be said to have begun right around the pivotal year of 1781, when Kant's Critique of Pure Reason appeared. It was around this time that German thought started to understand itself as existing in a period when philosophy's main traditional options appeared to have been played out, and it no longer seemed appropriate to define oneself as simply modern or enlightened.\\" Friedrich Nietzsche, photograph by Friedrich Hartmann, German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German university system. German idealists, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the members of Jena Romanticism (Friedrich H√∂lderlin, Novalis, and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel), transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.Frederick C. Beiser, German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781‚Äì1801, Harvard University Press, 2002, p. viii: \\"the young romantics‚ÄîH√∂lderlin, Schlegel, Novalis‚Äî[were] crucial figures in the development of German idealism.\\" Arthur Schopenhauer's identification of this world-constituting process as an irrational will to live influenced later 19th- and early 20th-century thinking, such as the work of Friedrich Nietzsche. The 19th century took the radical notions of self-organization and intrinsic order from Goethean science and Kantian metaphysics, and proceeded to produce a long elaboration on the tension between systematization and organic development. Foremost was the work of Hegel, whose Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) and Science of Logic (1813‚Äì16) produced a \\"dialectical\\" framework for ordering of knowledge. As with the 18th century, developments in science arose from philosophy and also challenged philosophy: most importantly the work of Charles Darwin, which was based on the idea of organic self- regulation found in philosophers such as Smith, but fundamentally challenged established conceptions. After Hegel's death in 1831, 19th-century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical naturalism, such as the positivism of Auguste Comte, the empiricism of John Stuart Mill, and the historical materialism of Karl Marx. Logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline, as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of George Boole and Gottlob Frege. Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include: * Gottlob Frege and Henry Sidgwick, whose work in logic and ethics, respectively, provided the tools for early analytic philosophy. * Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, who founded pragmatism. * S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, who laid the groundwork for existentialism and post-structuralism. Contemporary (20th and 21st centuries) Martin Heidegger The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatism.Nicholas Joll, \\"Contemporary Metaphilosophy\\" They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. The 20th century deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems. 20th century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve, and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systems. Seminal figures include Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The publication of Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900‚Äì1) and Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th- century philosophy.Spindel Conference 2002 ‚Äì 100 Years of Metaethics. The Legacy of G.E. Moore, University of Memphis, 2003, p. 165. The 20th century also saw the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the beginning of the current (contemporary) era of philosophy.M.E. Waithe (ed.), A History of Women Philosophers: Volume IV: Contemporary Women Philosophers, 1900-Today, Springer, 1995. Since the Second World War, contemporary philosophy has been divided mostly into analytic and continental traditions; the former carried in the English speaking world and the latter on the continent of Europe. The perceived conflict between continental and analytic schools of philosophy remains prominent, despite increasing skepticism regarding the distinction's usefulness. =Analytic philosophy= Bertrand Russell In the English-speaking world, analytic philosophy became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. The term \\"analytic philosophy\\" roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non- classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Though the movement has broadened, it was a cohesive school in the first half of the century. Analytic philosophers were shaped strongly by logical positivism, united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to logic and language. Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, beginning with their rejection of British idealism, their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis. Russell's classic works The Principles of Mathematics, \\"On Denoting\\" and Principia Mathematica (with Alfred North Whitehead), aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy, set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition, emphasizing such problems as: the reference of proper names, whether 'existence' is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, and discussions on the foundations of mathematics. These works also explored issues of ontological commitment and metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind, persistence and change, which Russell often tackled with the aid of mathematical logic. Gottlob Frege, Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) was the first analytic work, according to Michael Dummett (Origins of Analytical Philosophy, 1993). Frege took \\"the linguistic turn,\\" analyzing philosophical problems through language. Some analytic philosophers held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of human language. In 1921, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who studied under Russell at Cambridge, published his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which gave a rigidly \\"logical\\" account of linguistic and philosophical issues. Years later, he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the Tractatus, in for example his second major work, Philosophical Investigations (1953). Investigations was influential in the development of \\"ordinary language philosophy,\\" which was mainly promoted by Gilbert Ryle and J. L. Austin. In the United States, meanwhile, the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine was having a major influence, with the paper \\"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\\". In that paper Quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable. Patricia Churchland, 2005 Notable students of Quine include Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett. The later work of Russell and the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the 20th century. But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a \\"new metaphysics\\" of possible worlds, as in the influential work of David Lewis. Recently, the experimental philosophy movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques. Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: Timothy Williamson, David Lewis, John Searle, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Michael Dummett, John McDowell, Saul Kripke, Peter van Inwagen, and Patricia Churchland. Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of A Theory of Justice by John Rawls and Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick, analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with Roger Scruton, Nelson Goodman, Arthur Danto and others developing the subject to its current shape. =Continental philosophy= Sigmund Freud by Max Halberstadt, 1921 Continental philosophy is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from mainland Europe. 20th-century movements such as German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism, modern hermeneutics (the theory and methodology of interpretation), critical theory, structuralism, post-structuralism and others are included within this loose category. While identifying any non-trivial common factor in all these schools of thought is bound to be controversial, Michael E. Rosen has hypothesized a few common continental themes: that the natural sciences cannot replace the human sciences; that the thinker is affected by the conditions of experience (one's place and time in history); that philosophy is both theoretical and practical; that metaphilosophy or reflection upon the methods and nature of philosophy itself is an important part of philosophy proper.Michael Rosen, \\"Continental Philosophy from Hegel\\", in A. C. Grayling (ed.), Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject, Oxford University Press (1998), p. 665. The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective, while Martin Heidegger drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional existential approach to ontology. Phenomenologically oriented metaphysics undergirded existentialism‚ÄîMartin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Albert Camus‚Äîand finally post- structuralism‚ÄîGilles Deleuze, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard (best known for his articulation of postmodernism), Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida (best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction). The psychoanalytic work of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, and others has also been influential in contemporary continental thought. Conversely, some philosophers have attempted to define and rehabilitate older traditions of philosophy. Most notably, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Alasdair MacIntyre have both, albeit in different ways, revived the tradition of Aristotelianism. S√∏ren Kierkegaard, sketch by Niels Christian Kierkegaard, Existentialism Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), page 259. shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject‚Äînot merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual. In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called \\"the existential attitude\\", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience. Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought. German idealism Portrait of Immanuel Kant, German idealism emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s.Frederick C. Beiser, German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801, Harvard University Press, 2002, part I. Transcendental idealism, advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood, since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data‚Äîa framework including space and time themselves‚Äîhe maintained that things-in-themselves existed independently of human perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant's account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy. The most notable work of absolute idealism was G. W. F. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between \\"being\\" and \\"not being\\"), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination (\\"being\\" and \\"not being\\" are resolved with \\"becoming\\"). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the \\"Hegelian dialectic\\". Philosophers influenced by Hegel include Ludwig Feuerbach, who coined the term \\"projection\\" as pertaining to humans' inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; Karl Marx; Friedrich Engels; and the British idealists, notably T. H. Green, J. M. E. McTaggart, F. H. Bradley, and R. G. Collingwood. Few 20th-century philosophers embraced the core tenets of German idealism after the demise of British idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic, most notably Frankfurt School critical theorists, Alexandre Koj√®ve, Jean-Paul Sartre (in his Critique of Dialectical Reason), and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. A central theme of German idealism, the legitimacy of Kant's \\"Copernican revolution\\", remains an important point of contention in 21st-century post-continental philosophy. Marxism and critical theory Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis, originating from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. Marxist analyses and methodologies influenced political ideologies and social movements. Marxist understandings of history and society were adopted by academics in archeology, anthropology, media studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology and philosophy. In contemporary philosophy, the term \\"critical theory\\" describes the Western Marxist philosophy of the Frankfurt School, which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. Critical theory maintains that ideology is the principal obstacle to human emancipation.Geuss, R. The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, ch. 4. Phenomenology and hermeneutics Edmund Husserl, in the 1910s Edmund Husserl's phenomenology was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general. An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called intentionality. Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses. Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich (Munich phenomenology) and G√∂ttingen (G√∂ttingen phenomenology). Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as Martin Heidegger (formerly Husserl's research assistant and a proponent of hermeneutic phenomenology, a theoretical synthesis of modern hermeneutics and phenomenology), Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism. Structuralism and post-structuralism Ferdinand de Saussure Inaugurated by the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the discourses they both limit and make possible. Saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks man. Structuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by post-structuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize it. Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines. While the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossible. Structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Roland Barthes and Jacques Lacan. Post- structuralism came to predominate from the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and even Roland Barthes; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations. =Pragmatism= Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870. It asserts that the truth of beliefs consists in their usefulness and efficacy rather than their correspondence with reality. Charles Sanders Peirce and William James were its co-founders and it was later modified by John Dewey as instrumentalism. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualized final truth as something established only by the future, final settlement of all opinion. William James in 1906 Pragmatism attempted to find a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. It interpreted the meaning of a statement by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Inquiry taken far enough is thus the only path to truth.Peirce, C. S. (1878), \\"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\\", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, 286‚Äì302. Reprinted often, including Collected Papers v. 5, paragraphs 388‚Äì410 and Essential Peirce v. 1, 124‚Äì41. See end of ¬ßII for the pragmatic maxim. See third and fourth paragraphs in ¬ßIV for the discoverability of truth and the real by sufficient investigation. Also see quotes from Peirce from across the years in the entries for \\"Truth\\" and \\"Pragmatism, Maxim of...\\" in the Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms, Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki. For Peirce commitment to inquiry was essential to truth-finding, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not fruitless. The interpretation of these principles has been subject to discussion ever since. Peirce's maxim of pragmatism is, \\"Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\\" Critics accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: that because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is an appropriate basis for its truthfulness. Pragmatist thinkers include Dewey, George Santayana, and C. I. Lewis. Pragmatism was later worked on by neopragmatists Richard Rorty who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979),Pragmatism ‚Äì Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. Neopragmatism has been described as a bridge between analytic and continental philosophy.William Egginton/Mike Sandbothe (eds.). The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy. Contemporary Engagement between Analytic and Continental Thought. SUNY Press. 2004. Back cover. =Process philosophy= Process philosophy is a tradition beginning with Alfred North Whitehead, who began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined Harvard University in 1924. This tradition identifies metaphysical reality with change. Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to continental philosophy than analytic philosophy, because it is usually only taught in continental departments.William Blattner, \\"Some Thoughts About \\"Continental\\" and \\"Analytic\\" Philosophy\\" However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus continental methods in contemporary philosophy.Nicholas Gaskill, A.J. Nocek, The Lure of Whitehead, University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: \\"it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the \\"continentals,\\" not scientific enough for the \\"analytics,\\" and too metaphysical‚Äîwhich is to say uncritical‚Äîfor them both\\" and p. 231: \\"the analytics and continentals are both inclined toward Kantian presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce.\\" =Thomism= Alasdair MacIntyre in 2009 Largely Aristotelian in its approach and content, Thomism is a philosophical tradition that follows the writings of Thomas Aquinas. His work has been read, studied and disputed since the 13th century, especially by Roman Catholics. Aquinas enjoyed a revived mainstream interest beginning in contemporary philosophy, among both atheists (Philippa Foot) and theists (Elizabeth Anscombe). Thomist philosophers tend to be rationalists in epistemology, as well as metaphysical realists and virtue ethicists. They claim that humans are rational animals whose good can be known by reason that can be achieved by the will. Thomists argue that soul or psyche is real and immaterial but inseparable from matter in organisms. Soul is the form of the body. Thomists accept Aristotle's causes as natural, including teleological or final causes. In this way, although Aquinas argued that whatever is in the intellect begins in the senses, natural teleology can be discerned with the senses and abstracted from nature through induction.Aquinas, De veritate, Q. 2, art. 3, answer 19. Contemporary Thomism encompasses multiple variants, from neo-scholasticism to existential Thomism. The so-called new natural lawyers like Germain Grisez and Robert P. George applied Thomistic legal principles to contemporary ethical debates, while Freeman proposed that Thomism's cognition was most compatible with neurodynamics. Analytical Thomism (John Joseph Haldane) encourages dialogue between analytic philosophy and broadly Aristotelian philosophy of mind, psychology and hylomorphic metaphysics. Other contemporary Thomists include Eleonore Stump, Alasdair MacIntyre and John Finnis. Western philosophical subdisciplines Western philosophers have often been divided into some major branches, or schools, based either on the questions typically addressed by people working in different parts of the field, or notions of ideological undercurrents. In the ancient world, the most influential division of the subject was the Stoics' division of philosophy into logic, ethics, and physics (conceived as the study of the nature of the world, and including both natural science and metaphysics). In contemporary philosophy, specialties within the field are more commonly divided into metaphysics, epistemology, ethics and aesthetics (the latter two of which together comprise axiology, or value theory). Logic is sometimes included as a main branch of philosophy, sometimes as a separate science philosophers happen to work on, and sometimes just as a characteristically philosophical method applying to all branches of philosophy. Within these broad branches there are now numerous sub-disciplines of philosophy. At the broadest level there is the division between analytic (the English-speaking world and Nordic countries) and continental philosophy (in the rest of Europe).

The pond is 3.49 acres (14,120 m2) in area, is rectangular in shape and is fed by a natural spring. History Mananchira was built as a bathing pool by the Zamorin Mana Vikrama, the feudal ruler of Kozhikode in around the 14th century. at the time of Tippu sultan Mysore ruler he made this as drinking water source as a gift For Sayed Jifri .The laterite obtained from excavating the pond was used to construct two palaces to the east and west. In the late 19th century, Calicut's municipal council decreed that the pond was to be reserved exclusively for drinking purposes, and prohibited its use for bathing, washing and recreational activities‚Äîa ruling that has remained in place ever since. The pond is an important source of drinking water for Kozhikode, but is susceptible to pollution from municipal sewage, domestic waste, and pollutants from nearby textile factories. An analysis of the water in 2000 by scientists from the Central Water Analysis Laboratory and Pondicherry Central University found that the pond was particularly bacteriologically contaminated during the monsoon season, and was highly alkaline afterwards. New park Mananchira Square, a park complex surrounding the lake was opened in 1994. Previously the Mananchira Square was known as Mananchira Maidanam (Playground) and was famous for football. Several football tournaments were conducted here. The Mananchira Maidanam was also famous for the religious activity called Mananchira Ayyappan Vilakku. The Mananchira Maidanam was transformed and named as Mananchira Square up on the leadership of then Kozhikode District Collector Mr Amitabh Kant, who was the administrator, by closing two roads in the vicinity. The place for conducting the Mananchira Ayyappan Vilakku (a religious function held every December) was shifted to Muthalakulam Maidanam (A ground near by to Mananchira Square / Maidanam, which was developed after filling a pond named Muthalakkulam). Cultural events The officials also kept a rule that Mananchira Square will not be used for any cultural or religious purpose, whereas nowadays its widely used for cultural purposes. There are many beautiful statues of Dhoti-clad Malayalam writers inside the park. The park opens after two pm and entrance is free. Other places of tourist attraction like the Pattala Pally and the Mittayi Theruvu are located near the park. The town hall and art gallery are also adjacent to the park. A hangout of non- Malayali residents called the Crown Theatre is on the western side of the park. The park has 250 beautiful lamp posts, an artificial rivulet and an open-air theater. The public library near the park has a huge collection of Malayalam and English books. CSI Church, Mananchira, Kozhikode Muthalakkulam The northern side of Mananchira is called Muthalakkulam. Muthalakkulam is traditional cloth drying ground used even now by the professionals in the laundry field. Touring Bookstall, Women's Hospital and Ahmadiyya Mosque are located here. Palayam Juma Masjid and the old Palayam bus station are also located here. Palayam junction boasts of the historic imperial building which was the first concrete building of Calicut city. Mananchira Square Mananchira Square is a park in the centre of Kozhikode, Kerala state, southern India. The historic maithan, adjacent to Mananchira has been converted into an acadia with trees and plants, an artificial hill, shrubs, sculpture, an open-air theatre, and a musical fountain. Mananchira Square is named after the man-made lake Mananchira around which it is situated in the centre of the city. It is named after Mahadevan Samoothiri, the erstwhile ruler of the Kozhikode Kingdom, known as Mana-vedan Chira (pond) and later transformed to Mana-an-Chira. 100 years ago Valiyangadi and the beach area was the centre of Kozhikode city. In the 1970s the downtown shifted to Mananchira area and again, in the 1980s, Mavoor Road became the centre of attraction. In 2010s, Thondayad Bypass area and Palazhi on the Airport road has emerged as the new city centre with a vibrant night life.

The Red Dragon Society is a secret society based at New York University, in New York, New York. The Red Dragon has long held the title to the most selective society at NYU, and has been known for its secrecy since its founding in 1898.  History  The Red Dragon Society was founded in 1898 upon the transfer of NYU's undergraduate college from Washington Square to University Heights. The Society inducts only rising seniors from the College of Arts and Science prior to their graduation. The Red Dragon is NYU's fourth oldest and perhaps most well known senior society. It was founded to create a robust network for the most distinguished students in the senior class of the College of Arts and Science, and it continues to pursue this goal today. The Red Dragon is thought to be the most selective society at NYU, tapping only a small group of rising seniors for membership each year. While the precise requirements to be inducted as a \\"Dragon\\" are largely unknown to those outside the society, the Red Dragon emphasizes the following qualities: academic excellence, a commitment to the betterment of the school and community, a non-intuitive sense of leadership, and dedication to moral action. The society is known for valuing merit above all else, and to date it is the only secret society at NYU that inducts both women and men. There is little publicly available information about the specific traditions and practices of the society, but lists of new members have been published sporadically over the last century. Membership was historically published in NYU's yearbook, Violet. Today, the Red Dragon tends to maintain a relatively low profile on campus, but periodically makes its presence known. In January 2004, the Bun, an NYU icon, disappeared from College of Arts and Science Dean Matthew Santirocco's desk. Days later, the dean received a ransom note reading, \\"I have the bun.\\" The \\"Bun Bandits\\" remained at large for several months and occasionally sent the Dean photos and kidnap notes. Eventually, a member of the Society facilitated its safe return to Dean Santirocco.  Membership  Members have historically been inducted from the Junior class at the end of each school year. New inductees are selected utilizing an ancient (and still) secret formula by members of the Society. By reputation, \\"Dragons\\" tapped are mavericks in some way. Little is known about this process, but membership is not a closely guarded secret. In addition to the periodic publication of the society's roster, Dragons can be identified at University events, such as commencement ceremonies in Washington Square Park, with Red Dragon Society pins. The Red Dragon Society boasts many of NYU's most influential alumni as members. These include some of America's most prominent doctors, attorneys, politicians, business people, artists and wealthiest alumni of the College. The society also maintains a faculty roster. The 1934 NYU yearbook lists Elmer Ellsworth Brown, Howard Cann, and Theodore Distler amongst the faculty associated with the Society.

In general, the manner in which this term is used today refers to methods currently in vogue within the software development industry where multiple individuals work simultaneously on the same activity; in these systems, programmers are often grouped in pairs at the same computer workstation, one observing the other working on the software and alternating roles at time intervals.  Traditional team management methods  Traditional software development has nearly always involved multiple programmers working on separate parts of a computer system for any project of significant scope and scale‚Äîa method of division of labour. Clearly, it is unreasonable to imagine that a single programmer could adequately complete all the required work for a complex system working entirely on their own within a viable timescale; and as development projects become more complex, specialised expertise becomes of paramount importance in aspects such as systems analysis, quality assurance, and technical challenges posed by individual components. Initially this tended to be an informal process, but with the rise of commercial software development as a viable industry, a more industrial and systematic approach became necessary. Paper-oriented systems methodologies originally designed for undertaking governmental projects, such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), assigned individual people to carry out individual tasks, and specified the role of designers as being clearly separate from that of the programmers in the waterfall software development model. This methodology also clearly separated each of the individual \\"life-cycle\\" stages through which a system development project progressed. The resulting \\"paper trail\\" for a systems development project could take so long to build that often parts of the analysis documentation‚Äîor sometimes its entirety‚Äîwas out of date by the time of actual development, rendering them worse than useless.  Modern trends: multiple programmers to one sub-task  Difficulties were experienced with these older methods, such as costs spiralling out of control as systems grew, and schedules failing to meet time-to-market targets. These issues gave rise to techniques such as pair programming, along with new systems lifecycle structures such as the Boehm spiral. Specification of these new approaches began in the mid-1980s and continues today. Many of these strategies involve multiple programmers working collaboratively on the same piece of source code as opposed to being individually responsible for individual tasks. For example, in \\"pair programming\\", responsibility for the resulting product is equally shared between two programmers who work on their assigned sub-task together. Benefits of this approach include the ability for deficiencies in knowledge and ability in specific areas to be compensated for by the other programmer; in addition, the shared responsibility is thought to increase incentives for meeting project deadlines and quality targets. This technique is frequently used in newer programming methodologies that are focused around object-oriented programming techniques, such as the Rational Unified Process and Extreme Programming (acronym \\"XP\\"), often in combination with design documentation methods such as the Unified Modelling Language (UML). In object-oriented programming languages, software functionality forms modular, discrete units (termed classes for the functional elements, and packages for constellations of interlinked classes that carry out a particular function); the two most well-known of these are C++ and Java. This lends itself well towards the division of programming projects into sub-teams, although issues are still often encountered in integrating the resulting product following completion of each sub-task.

It services the communities of South Bloomfield, Ashville, Commercial Point, and Amanda; in addition, students from Circleville and Grove City attend.  History  Teays Valley was officially established in 1963 when Ashville-Harrison, Walnut Township, and Scioto Township High Schools combined. At that time, the student population was just 1,650. They named the school \\"Teays Valley\\" after the ancient Teays River that ran under present day Pickaway County. The school district is the largest in Pickaway County. The district is featured in the Together Concepts video production \\"We Are Teays Valley\\". The video depicts a surprising number of achievements and innovations, as well as connections to American and world history.A New Film Sheds Light on Local Achievements In 2007, the Teays Valley Educational Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization was founded to promote excellence within the district. Schools =High schools=  Teays Valley High School  =Middle schools= The students living in the eastern part of the school district students go to Teays Valley East Middle School, while the ones living on the western side of the district go to Teays Valley West Middle School.  Teays Valley East Middle School  Opened in 2009, East Middle School is located in Ashville, Ohio, and hosts sixth through eighth grade students. Currently, there are 485 students enrolled at the school. Each grade is separated into two blocks, gold and blue. Each block is then assigned teaching staff for the core courses which consist of science, mathematics, social studies, and language arts. Other required courses (physical education, health education, college & career connections and arts education), and electives (vocal music, instrumental music). Nine sports are offered to students in both seventh and eighth-grade students. They are football, cross country, golf, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, and track and field. Non-competitive cheerleading is also offered. Like the high school, all teams compete in the Mid-state League Buckeye Division. Ashville Elementary and Walnut Elementary students feed into East. The school principal is Shannon Helser.  Teays Valley West Middle School  The school is located on 74.94 acres in the Village of Commercial Point, Ohio. The property was obtained in 2008 and is located next to Scioto Elementary. Currently, there are 502 students in grades sixth through eighth enrolled at the school. Each grade is separated into two blocks, gold and blue. Each block is then assigned teaching staff for the core courses which consist of science, mathematics, social studies, and language arts.

Scioto Elementary and South Bloomfield Elementary students feed into West. The principal is Michael Kauffeld. =Elementary schools= All of the district's elementary schools contain grades Pre-k through 5th grade.  Ashville Elementary  Ashville Elementary is a PK‚Äì5th grade school located in Ashville, Ohio. The school has 502 students as of February 2020. Originally a high school, the original building which was built in 1928, was transitioned to an elementary when Ashville‚ÄìHarrison School joined the district in 1963. In 2003, a new building was erected and the old building torn down. The mascot for the original school was the Broncos with black and orange as the colors.  Scioto Elementary  Scioto Elementary is the largest elementary school in the district with 677 students in grades PK‚Äì5. It is located in Commercial Point, Ohio next to West Middle School. The original school for Scioto Township was built on the location of the current school in 1917 and was demolished in 2003. The elementary was one of the three schools that originally made up the district in 1963. Scioto had been known as the Buffaloes with red and black as the school's colors.  South Bloomfield Elementary  South Bloomfield is the newest of the elementary schools, it is also the smallest with 422 students as of February 2020. The school opened in 2013 and has grades PK‚Äì5. The students feed into West Middle School upon advancement to sixth grade.  Walnut Elementary  Walnut Elementary is a PK‚Äì5th grade school located near the former village of Nebraska, Ohio and in Walnut Township. The school is the only building in the district that is not in the incorporation limits of a city or village. Walnut Township School was built in 1922 and were known as the Tigers with the colors of black and red. The building was torn down in 2003 when a new school was erected next to it. Currently, 513 students attend Walnut and eventually go to East Middle School. =Former schools=  Teays Valley Middle School  Opened in 1985, all sixth through eighth grade students attended this central campus. In 2002, the school expanded adding a new cafeteria, music rooms and several classrooms. Due to rapid growth in Scioto Township, the district decided to build two new middle schools and split the students based on the location of their residence. The new schools opened in 2009 and the former middle school became the Freshman Campus, District offices and home to Brooks-Yates.

The club won the league championship in 1907 but disbanded in the middle of the 1908 season.Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 217. Origins The Champs were among several minor league ball clubs that operated in Youngstown, Ohio, in the early 20th century. The team was preceded by the Youngstown Ohio Works, which won two consecutive league championships in 1905 and 1906. In 1907, the Ohio Works' sponsors, local industrialists Joseph and Thomas McDonald, approved the sale of the franchise to Zanesville investors. As the Marion Daily Mirror observed in March 1907, this move raised questions about the future of the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League. \\"For a time the threatened withdrawal of Youngstown portended the break up of the league\\", the paper stated. \\"Sharon and New Castle felt they could not support clubs without the rivalry that existed between the three towns\\". The article added that three candidates were initially considered for the position of club manager: Mert Whitney, a player with a Buffalo, New York, franchise who previously played first base for the Youngstown club; Harry Ostdiek, a recently signed catcher from Canton, Ohio; and Sam L. Wright, the city editor of The Youngstown Daily Vindicator. According to the article, however, the withdrawal of the Youngstown club's previous manager had dampened efforts to secure funding for a new franchise. \\"The fact that Marty Hogan will in no way be connected with the Youngstown team has made the work much harder than ordinary for the promoters\\", the paper stated. Ultimately, a new club was organized, with Wright as manager. That year, the Youngstown Baseball Company took an office on the mezzanine floor of the Dollar Bank Building in downtown Youngstown. Wright, who was former sports editor of the Vindicator, went on to serve as president of the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League in 1909. Championship and dissolution The Youngstown club won the 1907 championship in a close race with a Newark, Ohio, franchise. The Champs closed the season with an 86-53 record, while the Newark Newks worked up an 86-52 record, placing second in the league. The Champs met with less success the following season. On June 9, 1908, the Vindicator reported the Champs' claim that two losses suffered at East Liverpool, Ohio, and McKeesport, Pennsylvania, resulted from \\"putrid\\" drinking water at East Liverpool that made the players sick. The Champs' situation failed to improve, and in the middle of the 1908 season, the club's owners withdrew their sponsorship. The team was later replaced by the Youngstown Indians, which competed in the Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League in 1909, under the sponsorship of a New Castle, Pennsylvania, stock company.

It was based on the British paratroopers' Denison smock. The use of the pattern is widespread in Africa, despite its association with France, because armed factions and militaries tend to obtain them from whichever source has it available. There are two major types of lizard pattern, horizontal like the original French design, and vertical like the early variant developed by Portugal. In addition, the Vietnam War tigerstripe pattern is descended from Lizard. Evolution of lizard patterns Lizard camo BDU and pants. Lizard patterns have two overlapping prints, generally green and brown, printed with gaps so that a third dyed color, such as a lighter green or khaki, makes up a large part of the pattern. In this, it is printed like earlier British patterns used on that country's Paratroopers Denison smocks. Lizard patterns have narrower printed areas than the British patterns, and the original form had a strong horizontal orientation, disrupting the vertical form of the soldier's body. =Horizontal lizard patterns= Two Foreign Legion paratroopers in Kolwezi in 1978. Horizontal lizard patterns in different colour forms were made by the French. A copy of the French pattern, made in Asia, was adopted by some African countries such as Chad, Gabon, Rwanda, and Sudan. In around 1970 Cuba designed a gray variety, used by Cuba and by the FAPLA of Angola. Greece has used a range of horizontal lizard patterns from the 1960s. Russian Spetsnaz and interior ministry troops wear horizontal lizard patterns. The Israel Defence Force used actual French lizard uniforms (donated by France) until 1968, alongside plain (unpatterned) battledress. French lizard was among the patterns used in Congo in 1978. After the Algerian War the \\"Troupes A√©roport√©e\\" (Airborne Troops) \\"Tenue Leopard\\"/\\"tenues de saut\\" was officially withdrawn from French service in January 1963 as it was felt to be a reminder of the Paratroops mutiny.

The lizard pattern had been in use in Portugal since 1956 with the Air Force's Paratroopers, being extended to the Army's Special Rifles units in 1960. With the Portuguese Military engaged in the Overseas Wars mainly fought in the African jungles, the camouflaged uniform was issued throughout the whole Army and some units of the Navy and Air Force. In 1963, a vertical lizard pattern was developed, this replacing the French horizontal pattern. Paradoxically, the Portuguese vertical lizard pattern become popular amongst some of the guerrillas that opposed Portugal in the Overseas Wars and was later adopted by the armed forces of some of the former Portuguese African colonies after their independence. The Portuguese vertical lizard pattern was adopted by Brazil, which developed a range of colorways for each of its armed services. Egypt, Greece, India, Lebanese Palestinians and Syria have all used variants of the vertical lizard pattern. SWAPO guerrillas in Namibia wore a wide variety of camouflage, including Portuguese lizard. =Other descendants= The Vietnam War tigerstripe is descended from Lizard. It began as a French experimental pattern during the Indochina war. It was based on the TAP47 lizard pattern, and was adopted by the South Vietnamese Marines. Tigerstripe differed from lizard in having its printed areas interlocked rather than overlapped; it also used smaller areas of dyed background color.

Background After a series of pogroms in which people from the former Eastern Region of Nigeria living in other parts of that country were massacred between 1966 and 1967, the region seceded in 1967 and proclaimed an independent Republic of Biafra. A bitter war ensued as Nigeria fought to foil the secession of the oil-rich region. After three years of war and the loss of more than two million lives, the nascent republic lost its struggle for independence and was reabsorbed into Nigeria in January 1970. The leader of the republic, Oxford educated General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, went into exile, but later returned to Nigeria in 1983 under special pardon. In 1969 Biafra adopted one of the most progressive national constitutions in Africa at the time. The Constitution or \\"Principles\\" drew heavily from traditional communal modes of governance but was also informed by progressive political developments in other parts of the world in the 1960s, and the ideology of \\"Non-alignment\\" adopted by several post-colonial states during the Cold War. It also provided a platform for the country to criticise the West for its role in the plight of the rest of the world and to set out the ideals of the young nation. Document Modeled on Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere's 1967 Arusha Declaration, it was one of multiple documents drafted by Biafra's National Guidance Committee, a body including renowned author Chinua Achebe. The declaration criticized corruption in both Nigeria and Biafra, as well as imperialism on the part of outside countries, and encouraged patriotism among the Biafrans. According to Alexis Heraclides in her book The Self- Determination of Minorities in International Politics, the declaration signaled a shift to a more politically radical phase in Biafra's short history. General Ojukwu lambasted Britain, and in particular the \\"Anglo-Saxon branch of [the white] race\\", for having repeatedly \\"sinned against the world\\" in the form of numerous genocides, including that of the Biafran people: > For two years we have been subjected to a total blockade. We all know how > bitter, bloody and protracted the First and Second World Wars were. At no > stage in those wars did the white belligerents carry out a total blockade of > their fellow whites. In each case where a blockade was imposed, allowance > was made for certain basic necessities of life in the interest of women, > children and other non-combatants. Ours is the only example in recent > history where a whole people have been so treated. What is it that makes our > case different? Do we not have women, children and other non-combatants? > Does the fact that they are black women, black children and black non- > combatants make such a world of difference? The tract encourages the Biafran people to persist in their efforts, assuring them of the moral value of their sacrifices. Ojukwu emphasizes the difference between this revolution and other revolutions, in that the world seems to be unified against their cause; economic and political interests, as well as racist indifference to the suffering of black-skinned noncombatants, are the especial challenges of the Biafran movement. The \\"Nigerianism\\" against which they were struggling was merely a system of opportunism and exploitation: > Our struggle has far-reaching significance. It is the latest recrudescence > in our time of the age-old struggle of the black man for his full stature as > man. We are the latest victims of a wicked collusion between the three > traditional scourges of the black man - racism, Arab-Muslim expansionism and > white economic imperialism. Playing a subsidiary role is Bolshevik Russia > seeking for a place in the African sun. Our struggle is a total and vehement > rejection of all those evils which blighted Nigeria, evils which were bound > to lead to the disintegration of that ill-fated federation. Our struggle is > not a mere resistance - that would be purely negative. It is a positive > commitment to build a healthy, dynamic and progressive state, such as would > be the pride of black men the world over... > ...Since in the thinking of many white powers a good, progressive and > efficient government is good only for whites, our view was considered > dangerous and pernicious: a point of view which explains but does not > justify the blind support which these powers have given to uphold the > Nigerian ideal of a corrupt, decadent and putrefying society. To them > genocide is an appropriate answer to any group of black people who have the > temerity to attempt to evolve their own social system. > When the Nigerians violated our basic human rights and liberties, we > decided reluctantly but bravely to found our own state, to exercise our > inalienable right to self-determination as our only remaining hope for > survival as a people. Yet, because we are black, we are denied by the white > powers the exercise of this right which they themselves have proclaimed > inalienable. In our struggle we have learnt that the right of self- > determination is inalienable, but only to the white man.

The attack resulted in the ransacking and devastation of the town by fire. Situation After winning the decisive Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813, Wellington's army advanced into the western Pyrenees to take the mountain passes and to face Marshal Soult's who had retreated back to France to try to reorganise his army. To clear his rear area, and to evict the last French forces from Spain, Wellington needed to take Pamplona and San Sebasti√°n. Lacking resources to attack both simultaneously, Pamplona was blockaded and San Sebasti√°n was put under siege. The blockade of Pamplona took time, but resulted in the surrender of the French forces there due to starvation on 31 October 1813. Forces Louis Emmanuel Rey On 1 July General of Brigade Rey's 3,170-man French garrison consisted of the 22nd and 34th Line (1 battalion each), 62nd Line (2 battalions), elements of the 1st and 119th Line, one company each of sappers and pioneers, and two companies of gunners.Oman VII, p.529. Seventy-six guns lined the fortifications.Fortescue IX, p.226. To prosecute the siege, Lieut- Gen Sir Thomas Graham was given command of 9,000 troops from Maj-Gen John Oswald's 5th Division and Brig-Gen Henry Bradford's Portuguese brigade. Graham initially deployed 40 heavy guns from various sources.Oman VI, p.567 & 569 Javier Sada has stated that the makeup of the allied troops investing the town included an important multinational share of soldiers of fortune, whose only incentive was the booty obtained in the conquered strongholds. According to Charles Oman (1902-1930), the 5th Division had 3,900 British officers and men and 2,300 Portuguese, with a further 2,300 Portuguese troops in Bradford's brigade.Oman VI p.750 to 760, Marching strengths 25 May 1813, minus Battle of Vitoria casualties. Approaches San Sebasti√°n (Donostia in Basque), had 9,104 inhabitants at the time and was more liberal than the surrounding conservative province of Gipuzkoa. The town was open to different influences from Gascony and France in the north and Spain in the south. Moreover, the make-up of the town had been conspicuously mixed ethnic Gascon and Basque since its foundation, although the Gascon language may have died out already by this point in the town's history. After Napoleon's takeover in France, his elder brother Joseph I was proclaimed king of Spain in 1808. Francisco Amor√≥s, who is cited in many accounts as \\"French-minded\\", was then appointed chief magistrate of the town. While it seems that the new authorities and aides were not held in especially high regard by the population, peace prevailed throughout the period up to 1813, and French troops were generally well accepted. This balance swung when French troops retreating under Emmanuel Rey's command and refugees fleeing Vitoria after the French defeat arrived in the city in June. Book in Spanish San Sebasti√°n stands on a peninsula extending into the Bay of Biscay and runs generally north to south. The southern face of the city's fortifications was very strong with a large hornwork blocking the approaches with the higher town walls mounting guns that could fire over the hornwork to protect it. \\"it was the strongest fortification I ever saw, Gibraltar excepted\\", wrote William Dent.L. Woodford (ed.), A Young Surgeon in Wellingtons Army: the Letters of William Dent (Old Woking, 1976), p. 39. On its eastern side, the city was protected by the estuary of the Urumea River. British engineers detected a weak point near the riverfront at the city's southeastern corner. Assaults were possible across the river bed at low tide from both the south and the east. Breaching batteries could be placed south of the city and in sandhills on the east side of the estuary, which could themselves be protected from counterattack by the river. British sea power could not be utilized because the Biscayan blockading fleet was understrength. French vessels regularly brought in supplies and reinforcements, while taking out wounded and sick soldiers. Because of this, Wellington could not expect to starve out the city. He would have to breach the walls and carry the city by assault. First Siege An engraving of the siege of San Sebastian (1813) The first objective was the capture of a convent, on high ground, south of the hornwork. Work started on 11 July on two batteries from the convent, being completed and armed on the night of the 13/14 July. Continuous fire until 17 July reduced the convent to ruins, it was stormed and captured with no difficulties. On 13 July work began on three batteries in sand dunes and a fourth on the hill of Mount Olia, all east of the river, at a range of and , connected by trenches. Fire was commenced and continued day after day against the town walls and towers until by 23 July three breaches had been made. The captured convent was engineered to protect it from the north and batteries constructed to fire on the hornwork and town. On 20/21 July a parallel trench was thrown across the peninsular midway to the hornwork, where it was discovered that a large drain ran underground to the hornwork. It was decided to mine the end of the drain. At dawn on 25 July an attack was launched. preceded by the explosion of the mine, troops would assault to hornwork mine breach and the two town wall breaches. The mine was exploded too early, when it was still dark, the troops attacked but could not get support from the artillery as it was too dark to see. The hornwork was assaulted but the follow up troops were late arriving and the advance party were beaten back. The troops assaulting the walls were exposed to fire for 300 yards across the tidal flats. Although they reached the top of the breaches, the supports were again slow and they were beaten back with great loss of life. The British suffered 693 killed and wounded and 316 captured, including Harry Jones who was wounded while leading the forlorn hope. Rey's garrison lost 58 killed and 258 wounded. The assault having failed the siege was reconsidered. Supplies of ammunition for the guns running low, and on the same day, 25 July, Wellington learnt that Soult had launched an attack (which would become the Battle of the Pyrenees). The decision was to postpone the siege pending receipt of more supplies by ship, and Graham was ordered to remove his guns to ships at Pasaia. During the intermission, the garrison made several sorties, capturing 200 Portuguese soldiers as prisoners. Second Siege A British map of the siege After driving Soult back across the frontier, Wellington waited until the rest of the battering train and sufficient supplies of shot had arrived from England before he again turned his attention to San Sebasti√°n: even with the increased resources now available to him, Wellington could only mount one formal siege at a time, whilst it was decided to plump for San Sebastian on the grounds that it was weaker, more accessible and open to resupply by sea. By 15 August the French commander, Rey had received some drafts from blockade running vessels but, even so, he only had 2,700 effective troops and 300 wounded in hospital. On 19 August British supplies started to arrive, including additional engineering pioneers so that by 23 August the guns were ready to resume the offensive. By 26 August the British had established batteries for 63 pieces of artillery.Oman VII, p.12. On 26 August, 15 heavy cannon from the south and 48 guns from the east were blasting away, destroying towers and making more breaches in the walls. On 27 August, 200 men from , , , and Surveillante rowed into the bay to the west and after a brief fight and a handful of casualties, captured a small island, Santa Clara. The British then moved six guns from Surveillante on to the island to establish a battery to enfilade the town and the castle. The French were dismayed as they had thought the island's sides were too steep to assault. The main breach in the east wall was almost long with the towers at each end demolished. In the south a sap had been pushed forward to the glacis of the hornwork. Colin Campbell leading the 'forlorn hope' at the Siege of San Sebasti√°n, 1813. Painting by William Barnes Wollen Because the attack had to be made as the tide fell, it was scheduled for 11:00 am on 31 August. Another mine was exploded, which partly took down a wall, but also created a series of craters so that when the 5th Division made the assault from the south on the main breach. The soldiers dashed across the from the trenches through the craters to the foot of the breach with little loss, but then the French opened a terrific fire. Again and again the men of the 5th Division rushed up the rubble-strewn breach, but they were cut down in swathes. The French had built a coupure (inner wall) that stopped the redcoats from breaking through the defences. Hundreds of British soldiers were killed. Graham committed 750 volunteers from the 1st, 4th, and Light Divisions, but they were unable to push back the French defenders. A Portuguese brigade splashed across the Urumea River and attacked the eastern breach, but their drive also stalled. After two hours, the assault was a costly failure. The survivors hugged the ground to avoid the searing fire. After consulting with his artillery commander, Alexander Dickson, Graham chose to open fire on the coupure's inner wall, despite the risk of killing many British soldiers who lay so close under the barrier. When the British heavy guns first fired over their heads, the survivors of the attack began to panic. But, when the smoke cleared, they saw that the big guns had wrecked most of the inner wall. With a yell, they charged, reached the top of the breach, and spilled into the city. At the sight of their defence lines broken, the French retreated to the fortress on the hill of Urgull and by midday the besiegers had taken over the town. Book in Spanish On inspection it was discovered that not a single shot had fallen short into the allied troops, even though they were fired from for 20 minutes and that, aided by an explosion of ready grenades and live shells on the wall, few defenders survived uninjured. 700 French were captured in the town which by now was in flames. Rey and the garrison surrenders (from a British book) Rey and the rest of his surviving garrison held out until 5 September before asking for terms. The French commander formally surrendered on 8 September, and, in recognition of a noble defence, the remainder of the garrison stationed in the fortress was granted the honours of war by the Anglo- Portuguese forces. They marched out of the stronghold with shouldered arms, flags flying, to the sound of the drums. Their officers were permitted to retain their swords. Ransacking and burning On entering the town, the victorious British and Portuguese troops quickly discovered plentiful supplies of brandy and wine in the shops and houses, with many soon becoming part of a \\"reeling, riotous mob\\".Watson, B. When soldiers quit: studies in military disintegration, Chapter 5 The Siege of San Sebastian, pg 80 Drunken and enraged at the heavy losses they had suffered, the troops ran amok, pillaging and burning the city and killing an unknown number of inhabitants according to some sources,Watson, B, When soldiers quit: studies in military disintegration, Chapter 5 The Siege of San Sebastian, pg 80 (quote: \\"rape and murder were allegedly visited on the town's population but no-one knows the number of victims\\") but they may amount to 1,000. Some British officers tried to stop the looting but were either ignored or threatened by the drunken soldiers, or turned a blind eye or added to the plight. Statements (75 reports) were gathered bearing witness to the events starting on 31 August. One of the survivors and witness Gabriel Serres claimed that, \\"[the assailants] committed the biggest atrocities, such as killing and injuring many inhabitants and also raping most of the women\\". The burning started that very night on some houses, according to local witnesses. Local Domingo de Echave gave evidence echoing an English soldier's words pointing to flames coming out of a house: \\"See that house ablaze? Mind you, tomorrow all like this.\\" The city kept burning yet for seven days, by which time only a handful of buildings survived. The rest of it burned to the ground--600 houses, city hall and record office included. After the burning, the town council and many survivors of the destruction held a meeting in Zubieta, where the devastated town dwellers decided the reconstruction of the town almost from scratch. Since the previous council had collaborated with the French, a new council was appointed, and a letter was written congratulating Wellington on his victory and requesting him that they'd be granted 2,000 starvation wages for those most in need. The demand was not met since Wellington refused to do so, and wholeheartedly wished in the reply that he not be addressed again. He went on to attribute the pillage to the French, and on 2 November while he was in Lesaka the British general denied any responsibility of the British troops on the burning. In November a popular trial was arranged by the town council \\"on the atrocious behaviour shown by the British and Portuguese troops\\", where tellingly only 2 women answered the questionnaire provided. The tragedy is remembered every year on August 31 with an extensive candlelit ceremony. Consequences Of Rey's original garrison of 3,170 plus some later drafts, 850 were killed, 670 had been captured on 31 August and 1,860 surrendered, of whom 480 were sick and wounded.Fortescue IX, p.360. Graham's command lost 3,770 killed, wounded and missing.Fortescue IX, p.359, based on Jones. In the final assault, 867 men died, 1,416 fell wounded and 44 were listed as missing.Oman VII, p.530 (with additions corrected). Maj-Gen James Leith, who had just returned to command the 5th Division, was wounded in the assault. The chief engineering officer who laid out the Lines of Torres Vedras, Sir Richard Fletcher, was shot through the heart and killed in the siege, as was one of Harry Burrard's sons. Not realizing he was too late to save San Sebasti√°n, Soult launched a final attack on 31 August. Spanish forces repelled this attempt in the Battle of San Marcial. With the possession of San Sebasti√°n, Wellington could think about driving Soult back into France. The next action was the Battle of the Bidassoa on 7 October, followed by the Battle of Nivelle in November. The French garrison of Pamplona surrendered to the Spanish on 31 October.

The game was released during October 2009 in North America, Europe, and Australia. Though Br√ºtal Legend was originally to be published by Vivendi Games prior to its merger with Activision, Activision dropped the game from its portfolio after the merger. It was later picked up by Electronic Arts, though Activision and Double Fine brought counter-lawsuits against each other over publishing issues. The issues were settled out of court. Later, Double Fine announced a port of the game for Microsoft Windows via Steam, which was released in February 2013. Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game were made available as part of the Humble Bundle in May 2013. A physical collector's edition for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux was released by IndieBox in October 2014. Tim Schafer, the game's creative director, was inspired to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after Jack Black, a roadie who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of heavy metal album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down- trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that can tap into the magical powers of the world, and a customizable hot rod. The game, a hybrid of the action-adventure and real-time strategy genres, includes Stage Battles in both the single-player and multiplayer mode, where the player must command troops to defeat their foes while defending their own stage. In addition to Black, the game features voices of heavy metal musicians including Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford and other celebrities such as Tim Curry, as well as more than one hundred metal songs selected by Schafer for inclusion in the game. Br√ºtal Legend was generally well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and writing of the heavy metal-inspired world, and the performances of the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time strategy games did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre. Gameplay Br√ºtal Legend is a third person action-adventure game incorporating real time strategy elements. The game uses an open world that Tim Schafer has described as being approximately in area. The player controls the protagonist Eddie Riggs, a roadie who one day finds himself transported into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world. Eddie acquires three tools that are used for combat and transportation: a broad axe called \\"The Separator\\", his Flying V guitar \\"Clementine\\" from his own world which has the ability to cast magic spells in the heavy metal world, and a hot rod that Eddie builds called \\"The Druid Plow\\", a.k.a. \\"The Deuce\\". Spells, referred to as \\"Solos\\", from Clementine are performed by playing a minigame akin to the note-matching aspect of Guitar Hero or Rock Band over a brief guitar riff; however, Eddie cannot use the metal generated by Clementine constantly, as prolonged usage of the guitar will cause it to overheat, and the player will have to wait for a cool-off period before using the guitar's power again. Eddie may also find more solos hidden throughout the world, ranging from support to offensive spells. The player can spend in-game currency called \\"Fire Tributes\\", earned from completing missions, at the Motor Forge to gain new abilities and upgrades for each tool. These tools can be used in combination with each other to take out Eddie's foes; for example, the player can use his guitar Clementine to create pyrotechnics to launch a foe into the air and follow up by attack it with the Separator axe. In a case of a specific boss fight, the player must use the Deuce hot rod to lure the boss to a spiked gate held up by counterweights, and then play the \\"Earthshaker\\" move on Clementine to destroy the weights and sever the creature's head. Within the open world, the player can use a map and the Deuce's turn signals to guide them towards either story-advancing missions or side missions. Side missions include hot-rod races against a demon, defending Eddie's allies from a pending attack, or helping a cannon operator spot his targets. There are about 23 main missions in the story with 30 side missions that the player can optionally take. The player can also explore the game's world to find statues bound in leather or chains that can be freed to gain a health boost for Eddie or to reveal part of the game's backstory, and can look through special telescopes at vistas or complete certain jumps to earn additional Fire Tributes. The player can also find monuments they can raise that unlock an additional heavy metal song from the game's soundtrack that can be played on the Deuce's radio, \\"The Mouth of Metal\\"; the player can further customize its set list with songs they have been rewarded with or have collected. alt=Screenshot showing a giant concert stage dominating the background, accented by gothic elements such as towering spires; the foreground shows several forces converging on the stage, including a flying winged creature, two people mounted on bear-like creatures, a giant brute, and several other ground forces. Several main story missions of the game are Stage Battles based on real time strategy elements. The player, while still in control of Eddie, is required to defend a giant stage where new allies will spawn, holding out until a specific objective is completed. The player creates an army for attacks by building merchandise booths on \\"fan geysers\\" through Clementine's magic. Once enough fans are collected, the player can summon different allies, each consuming a specific number of fans, or upgrade their stage to allow them to produce more powerful allies. A character known as Mangus acts as the \\"sound guy\\" to help in the construction of these units and stage upgrades, and also warns the player of enemy attacks. Once the player has gathered their army, they can then seek out and attack their opponents. Eddie is able to control the entire army to follow, attack, or defend a point, and can use specialized squads of specific units to perform certain tasks, such as having a group of headbangers use their headbanging to destroy statues. The player can also use Eddie directly in combat during these battles. Ultimately, Eddie transforms into a winged demon who can fly above the battlefields to issue orders or lay out attacks. Spells in Eddie's arsenal can help control the performance of his armies, such as temporarily boosting their attack skills or creating a rally flag which troops will gather at, while others hinder the performance of the enemy faction by removing enemy buffs or preventing the creation of enemy units for a short time. Each of the different units, including special allies that Eddie meets in the game, has a special co-op move they can perform with Eddie; for example, Eddie's first ally, Ophelia, can be tossed at foes by Eddie in the style of the Fastball Special. These co-op moves are also available outside of Stage Battle missions. The game has a multiplayer mode, described by Schafer as \\"your typical head-to-head, battle of the bands scenario. But with axes.\\" The multiplayer modes are team-based and play in the same manner as the single- player Stage Battles, with team sizes from one-versus-one to four-versus-four. Each team selects from one of three factions which affect what resources and troops they can summon, and are tasked with defending their stage from attack by the other team. The three factions available are Ironheade, mostly human- based troops led by Eddie Riggs; The Drowning Doom, with more Goth/Black Metal creatures led by Ophelia; and The Tainted Coil, evil creatures controlled by Doviculus. Each player controls a single main avatar who has the same abilities as in the main game for combat and magic spells and can also fly about the map, but also is in control of troops that they may summon from the team's shared resources‚Äîfans as generated by fan geysers across the map. Different types of troops are available, costing various numbers of fans to summon, with the potential to upgrade to improved units through different routes. The number and types of troops that can be summoned is limited by a cap to prevent either team from becoming too overpowered. All of the troops can be engaged by the player to initiate various \\"Double Team\\" moves as with the single player game. The game can also be played by a single player with computer-controller opponents at one of five difficulty levels. Synopsis =Characters= Br√ºtal Legend follows the story of Eddie Riggs (voiced by Jack Black), who is \\"the world's best roadie\\" for \\"the world's worst 'heavy metal' band\\", Kabbage Boy. Much of the game takes place in an unnamed world inspired by heavy metal music, created by, according to the game's mythology, Ormag√∂den, The Eternal Firebeast, Cremator of the Sky, and Destroyer of the Ancient World. In this alternate world, the human race is enslaved by a race of demons, led by Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil, (voiced by Tim Curry). Doviculus is assisted by his glam metal human minion, General Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford and based on David Bowie with the name being an allusion to glammetal band White Lion) whose hair is so big \\"and luscious\\" that he uses it to fly, flapping it like a pair of broad wings. Leading the fight against Doviculus are a small band of human resistance fighters with whom Eddie joins forces: Lars Halford (voiced by Zach Hanks), his sister Lita (voiced by Kath Soucie), and Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale), whom Eddie takes a romantic interest in. Their group is later joined by the stage manager Mangus (Alex Fernandez), the bass-playing healer Kill Master (voiced by, and patterned after Lemmy Kilmister), the motorcycle-riding Fire Baron (also voiced by Halford, as well as visually inspired by him too), and the Amazonian Rima (voiced by Lita Ford and based on KISS characters). Also supporting Eddie is the Guardian of Metal (voiced by Ozzy Osbourne, who also lent his appearance to the character) that assists in upgrading his equipment. =Plot= During a gig for Kabbage Boy, Eddie is crushed by falling scenery while trying to save a member of the band; his blood lands on his belt buckle, in reality an amulet for Ormag√∂den. The stage is transformed into Ormag√∂den, who kills the band and takes the unconscious Eddie to the heavy metal world. Awaking in the Temple of Ormag√∂den, Eddie meets with Ophelia while fighting Doviculus' forces, developing a crush on her. They discover writings left by the Titans that Eddie is able to comprehend, and build a hot-rod, the \\"Deuce\\", that they use to escape the Temple and travel to Bladehenge, the base for the small human resistance force led by Lars and Lita. When they meet Eddie and learn he can understand the Titans' messages, they see him as a prophetical \\"Chosen One\\", though a 'dispute about the translation' leaves them unsure if he will be the savior or destroyer of the world. Ophelia also becomes concerned when Eddie, in the heat of battle, transforms into a winged creature, an effect Eddie decides to use to his advantage at the time. Eddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia create an army, named \\"Ironheade\\" to fight against General Lionwhyte. They successfully raid Lionwhyte's \\"Pleasure Tower\\" and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus is aware of the presence of his spy \\"Succoria\\" by the smell of her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth \\"Drowning Doom\\". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and find more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned. With their new allies, Ironheade manages to push the Drowning Doom back towards the Sea of Black Tears; defeated, Ophelia denies Eddie's belief that she is Doviculus' spy, again claiming that Eddie's the traitor. As they argue, Doviculus arrives and confirms that Succoria is not Ophelia, but Eddie's mother. In the past, Succoria, an even more vicious demon empress, also sought the Titans' secrets in the future. However, after discovering that humans eventually become the dominant species, Succoria fell into a deep despair. Riggnarok, who had followed Succoria through time to assassinate her, took pity on her in her misery, and the two fell in love and bore Eddie. Now in the past, Eddie's demon nature has borne out, and has also inadvertently revealed the Titans' secrets to Doviculus as well. Having no more use for Ophelia, Doviculus rips out her heart, taking her powers alongside his own and causing Ophelia to dissipate. While Ironheade battles Doviculus' forces, Eddie engages Doviculus in a one-on-one confrontation, which ends with the demon emperor's decapitation. As Eddie escapes the Sea, he recovers Ophelia's heart from Doviculus, containing his mother's necklace he gave her when they first met, and then proceeds to rescue the real Ophelia from the ocean floor. Ashore, they rekindle their love as Ironheade celebrates their victory over Doviculus and the Tainted Coil. Back at Bladehenge, a statue to Lars is erected, while Lita continues to lead the troops against the remaining demons. Eddie insists on maintaining his \\"roadie\\" presence, staying behind the scenes and making others look good. After he promises he is not leaving to his assembled friends, Eddie takes off to complete a few errands, with Ophelia watching as he drives off into the sunset, shedding a single black tear. Development Creator Tim Schafer has said that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, \\"The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, thinking about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [a Lucasfilm Games title released in 1990]. And Br√ºtal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since.\\" The title, which he describes as sounding \\"like the hardest core fantasy thing out there\\", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title. Br√ºtal Legend was based on the creative inspiration of Tim Schafer, founder of Double Fine studios. Part of the game's inspiration came from the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing Br√ºtal Legend to \\"fulfill the promise\\" of such lore. Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him. Schafer had previously explored the idea of a roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from Day of the Tentacle, but Br√ºtal Legend represented an opportunity to expand on it further. The 2003 movie School of Rock also reminded Schafer of his idea for Br√ºtal Legend, and made him more excited to publish it. Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for Br√ºtal Legend's creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting Br√ºtal Legend to Psychonauts. Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of Br√ºtal Legend, such as \\"hot babes and Jack Black\\", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of Br√ºtal Legend, as despite poor sales of Psychonauts, \\"as long as you make a cool game, publishers want to talk to you\\". When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful Guitar Hero with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of Guitar Hero, the metal approach in Br√ºtal Legend was readily accepted. Schafer has pointed out that there are music term inspired attacks, such as a \\"Face-Melting\\" guitar solo, which literally will melt the foe's faces off. The metal/motorcyclist lifestyles and Norse mythology also inspired the game's open-world environments, such as amps carved into the face of a mountain, a forest where tires replace leaves, giant axes and swords piercing the ground, spandex covered temples, and mining facilities where human slaves excavated car and motorcycle parts. However, Schafer noted that they attempted to make sure that non-metal fans would be able to get the jokes as well. =Art design= The art style for the game was based on the work of Frank Frazetta and inspired by heavy metal and rock album covers. The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork if they felt it would be something that could be seen on such covers. The setting includes hot rod-like engines that grow from the earth like a \\"V8 Truffle Of Speed\\", with design inspired by the designs of Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth. The art team wanted to avoid creating \\"another brown-gray game\\", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art. Cutscenes in the game use the game's engine, though some pre-recorded scenes from the engine have also been prepared with the help of Tasha Harris, a former Pixar employee who helped to animate character's faces during cutscenes. The game features over 80 unique characters in addition to the main protagonist, Eddie Riggs. Initial designs for Riggs was modeled after Lemmy Kilmister, and though the model was changed, the signature vest, tour pass and cigarette of the character remained part of the character design. As the character continued to develop, they began to add more aspects of Black's character, an \\"enthusiastic fan\\" of music, from School of Rock. Ultimately, Riggs' design came to become half Jack Black and half Glenn Danzig. The art team was able to use videos of Black's performances to add additional features to the character, such as \\"all his crazy eyebrow stuff he does\\". General Lionwhyte, who has \\"fabulous hair\\", and his minions are based on the glam metal fad of the 1980s which displaced heavy metal to the disappointment of Schafer and other development team members, and became the opponents of the game. To help create a more mature game with concepts that could be used to pitch the game, the art team created several factions that represented different parts of the heavy metal experience. Each faction had their own \\"exaggerated, simplified shapes and strong silhouettes\\" as to help distinguish each faction while also reducing the development costs. Inspirations for such factions include Nordic imagery, goth metal, and the artwork of Hieronymus Bosch. Additional characters include headbangers, \\"gravediggers\\", and \\"battle nuns\\". As the game features over two hours of spoken dialog, the art team wants to make the characters' faces and performances stand out, creating \\"clean, easy-to-read faces\\". The team had to change from their initial cartoony textures into more detailed ones that stood out on high-definition displays while exaggerating other features of the characters. The user interface and menus were created by Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie. =Characters and voice acting= Br√ºtal Legend includes over 35,000 lines of spoken dialog, mostly written by Schafer. In addition to Black, Lemmy, Judas Priest's Rob Halford, The Runaways' Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne provide character voices for these lines. Schafer's original vision for the game had not anticipated a celebrity cast. In particular, though Eddie came to resemble Black, the team had not planned on having Jack Black voice the character. After learning that Black was a fan of Schafer's previous game, Psychonauts, they met with the actor/musician and recognized he was an avid gamer and metal fan and understood all the choices the team made in the game, and subsequently signed on for the voice work. Black also performed live-action sequences as himself used for the in-game menu screens and additional promotional material. Once Black had signed up for the project, Schafer found that other artists and people involved in the heavy metal scene became very interested in participating through a domino effect and word of mouth, allowing Schafer to sign them on as voice talent or as part of the game's soundtrack. Lemmy was brought on board to play The Kill Master after Schafer and his team had developed the character's role in the story who assists Eddie by healing his allies through a giant bass harp on the back of a chopper. The original character, a man with a top hat and beard, was considered out of place by Schafer, leading him to consider famous bass guitar players and quickly recognizing the need to have Lemmy play that role. Halford plays two characters, General Lionwhyte and The Baron. Schafer had selected Lionwhyte to capture Halford's ability to scream, and found his abilities in the studio beyond what they expected. They created The Baron character specifically for Halford, as while Lionwhyte was considered a \\"heavy metal Stewie [from Family Guy]\\", that character was the complete opposite of Halford, while The Baron captures both Halford and Judas Priest's attitude. Lita Ford voices Rima, queen of a group of \\"Amazon-like jungle women\\"; Schafer considered the similarities between the lack of clothing that Rima was designed with and Ford's outfits from the 1980s, staying true to the development teams' memories of her. Osbourne plays The Guardian of Metal who helps the player upgrade their equipment; Schafer commented that both the character and Osbourne, while dark and brooding, are \\"really upbeat\\" and \\"optimistic\\". alt=A photograph of Jack Black, in casual clothes, holding an acoustic guitar while on stage. Though Ronnie James Dio of the band Dio had performed parts for the game, his role was replaced with voice work from Tim Curry. While the change was speculated to be due to tense issues between Osbourne and Dio, Schafer noted that as Dio's intended character, \\"Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil\\", grew, they found that Curry fit the role better for the part, citing Curry's role of the Lord of Darkness in the film Legend as a key factor; Schafer would also later state that Dio's part was cut due to a combination of \\"really complicated reasons\\" and other circumstances outside their control. Curry considered the role \\"perfect\\" for him when Schafer described Doviculus to him as \\"big and tough, but also has this kinky side who, when hit with an ax, might scream in pain or squeal with delight\\". Similar to their experience with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial. This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named \\"Lita Halford\\". Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to \\"bleep\\" out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center \\"Parental Advisory\\" label, an icon that Schafer considered to be part of the history of heavy metal. A similar filter exists for gore in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children. During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were \\"especially conducive to character creation\\" due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows. Kyle Gass, Black's collaborator with Tenacious D, voices and lends his facial likeness to a neurotic cannon operator in the game. Comedians David Cross, Steve Agee, Brian Posehn, and Wil Wheaton have also provided voice work for the game; Posehn had previously worked with Schafer on their high school newspaper. David Sobolov was also confirmed as a voice actor for other roles in the game; Sobolov noted that he recorded his lines separate from Black's despite his characters' having direct interaction with Riggs. Richard Horvitz, who voiced protagonist Raz in Schafer's previous game, Psychonauts, cameos as the lead guitarist of Kabbage Boy and as a car-lift operator that assigns Eddie certain side missions. Further voice acting work has been provided by veteran video game actors such as Zach Hanks, Kath Soucie, Dino Andrade and Jennifer Hale. =Development history= According to Schafer, Br√ºtal Legend had been in development since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but were not able to successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Br√ºtal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies. Schafer stated that they began the development with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game‚Äîspecifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, they were able to expand out the rest of the game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game. The multiplayer gameplay itself was inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For Br√ºtal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Br√ºtal Legend. This subsequently led to much of the action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game. The team used Unreal Engine 2.5 to build and test prototypes of the real-time strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine. Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign. The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed ‚Äî this was also something the team had no prior experience with. Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named after one of the test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi- User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game- world without fear of overwriting each other's work. The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space. With the popularity of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if Br√ºtal Legend would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass. While Br√ºtal Legends fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals, until EA Partners picked up the game in December 2008. However, even when the fate of the publication of the game was unsure, the team continued to work on its development. Schafer reflected that the time spent during development without a publisher was beneficial, allowing them to design the game without pressure from the publisher's goals. EA CEO John Riccitiello, when asked about EA picking up Br√ºtal Legend for distribution prior to December 2008, commented that \\"Sometimes significant creative risks end up being some of the world‚Äôs best products\\". =Other platforms= When rumors of a possible Wii port arose in March 2009, Schafer stated that \\"We are making an Xbox 360 and a PS3 version of Br√ºtal Legend.\\" However, according to Ben Fritz at Variety, another studio has been engaged by Electronic Arts to bring the game to the Wii, albeit at a later date than the other console versions, suggesting that it may follow the same model as Dead Space: Extraction, a Wii title scheduled to be released about a year after Dead Space's first release. However, further industry rumors, which claimed that the Wii version was being done by Electronic Arts in-house, have stated that the effort to port the game to the Wii has been canceled due to quality and technical concerns. Initially after its release, Double Fine had not planned on a PC version of the game, as Schafer has stated that the game is primarily an action game and \\"meant to be on a console\\". However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles. The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they will look at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version. Mac and Linux ports were released in May 2013, premiering as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle. =Sequel= Double Fine believed they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Br√ºtal Legend after the game's release, and had invested a great deal of development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Br√ºtal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted that at the end of the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death. The cancellation of the sequel nearly ruined Double Fine, as they had invested all current efforts toward the title. Instead of a sequel, Double Fine began work on four smaller projects, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade (formerly titled Trenched) and Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster, based on prototypes they had created from \\"Amnesia Fortnights\\" during the development period where they had lacked a publisher. In these two-weeks sessions, the Double Fine team was split into four groups and each tasked with creating a small prototype game to share with the rest of the company; all four mini-games were well received internally. Upon hearing of the cancellation of the sequel, Schafer and his team began to promote these games around, and were able to obtain publishing deals for all four titles. The games will be able to take advantage of the custom game world engine and other assets they had created for Br√ºtal Legend. The titles were considered financial successes, allowing Double Fine to recover and pursue further game development though steering away from major AAA releases. As of 2013, Schafer is still interested in a sequel to Br√ºtal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources to make it happen as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, there is a good chance that a sequel to Br√ºtal Legend would be possible. Tim Schafer said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017 that Br√ºtal Legend will eventually get a sequel. =Publishing issues= Br√ºtal Legend was originally to be published by Vivendi Games' subsidiary Sierra Entertainment. In 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi's game division (which included Blizzard Entertainment) to become Activision Blizzard, gaining the rights to publication of Br√ºtal Legend. Upon evaluation of their assets, Activision Blizzard chose to drop Br√ºtal Legend along with several other games, leaving the project in limbo. Activision CEO Robert Kotick later claimed the reason for dropping the project was due to: the project running late; missing milestones; overspending the budget and not looking like a good game. Double Fine themselves were unaware that Activision had chosen to drop the game, having been informed through an Activision press release that omitted the game from their upcoming release schedule, according to studio producer Caroline Esmurdoc. Industry rumors suggested that Electronic Arts was interested in publishing the property, and it was confirmed in December 2008 that Electronic Arts would publish the game. During the period when Br√ºtal Legends fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals. In February 2009, Activision Blizzard had asserted that the Electronic Arts deal was invalid, believing that they were still in negotiations with Double Fine to publish the game. It was believed that Activision was seeking monetary compensation in a similar manner as it received from Atari for Ghostbusters: The Video Game and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, games that were dropped when Activision Blizzard re-evaluated their assets. On June 4, 2009, Activision filed suit to prevent publishing of the game, claiming that they had invested $15 million in the title and still had a valid contract to release the game. Activision's suit also contends that Double Fine had missed a deadline for the game last year, requesting more time and an additional $7 million in development fees. Activision's considers both the loss of the money they spent on the game as well as potential sales and Br√ºtal Legend-related merchandise as part of the harm done in the lawsuit. In July 2009, Double Fine issued a countersuit against Activision, citing that the latter company had abandoned the project before, and was trying to harm Br√ºtal Legend during its critical marketing phase, as well as trying to protect its Guitar Hero franchise. The countersuit stated that Activision had dropped the game after its merger with Vivendi and a failed attempt to convert the game into a Guitar Hero sequel. Schafer was infamously quoted as saying, in commenting on their actions, \\"Hey, if Activision liked it, then they should have put a ring on it. Oh great, now Beyonce is going to sue me too.\\" In late July, the presiding judge, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan, reported that a preliminary ruling that could have affected the game's release would have been given on August 6, 2009, with Karlan tentatively ready to deny Activision's motion to delay the game. However, prior to the ruling, the companies announced they had reached an out-of-court settlement on the lawsuits, though details were not available. Though most of the developers involved in the game were shielded from the effects of the lawsuit, Double Fine's Caroline Esmurdoc noted that it took a significant toll on Schafer and the other lead executives at the company. Activision's lawsuit had been filed at the time the game had reached the alpha release state, and would need to be concluded prior to the game's final release; this required the executives to dedicate their time towards information gathering, interviewing, and other legal matters \\"during the crunchiest, most critical time of development\\". As such, while they ultimately were able to settle the legal matter, Esmurdoc believed that the impact of the effort in settling the lawsuit impacted the quality of the final product. Schafer wrote more than 50% of the game's dialog in the few months following the completion of the lawsuit and prior to release, a \\"big crunch\\" for him. =Downloadable content= Schafer, prior to the game's release, stated that Double Fine had \\"something awesome\\" planned for downloadable content to further support the game after release. Two downloadable packs have since been released. The first, \\"Tears of the Hextadon\\", was released in early November 2009, containing two new multiplayer maps and a new single-player weapon. The pack was initially free on the PlayStation Network for the first two weeks of release. The second pack, \\"The Hammer of Infinite Fate\\", was released in mid- December 2009, and in addition to new multiplayer maps, expands the single- player experience by incorporating new weaponry for the Deuce, outfits for Eddie, a GPS system to track collectibles in the game's world, and other additional content, including figureheads of Razputin, the lead character from Psychonauts, and Schafer himself. Marketing 2009's E3 through a large banner on the South Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center. Br√ºtal Legend was announced in October 2007 through a feature article in Game Informer; gaming journalists had received a vinyl record from Activision that contained a backwards message alluding to the game's story. The game's release in October 2009 was promoted as \\"Rocktober\\" in official literature about the game from Electronic Arts. At the 2009 Download Festival in Donington Park in England, Electronic Arts arranged for 440 fans of Br√ºtal Legend to help to break the Guinness World Record for the largest number of air guitar players, all simultaneously playing to \\"Ace of Spades\\" by Mot√∂rhead. A series of short online videos featuring Black (and Schafer in two instances), entitled \\"Brutal Thoughts with Jack Black\\", have been used to promote the game since May 2009. At the 2009 Video Music Awards, Black appeared in cosplay as Eddie to promote the game. A promotional concert for the game was held at the 2009 Comic-Con International Convention in July 2009, and featured the metal artists Gwar, 3 Inches of Blood, Unholy Pink, and Keith Morris. It has also been announced that Brutal Legend was the official sponsor of the 2009 Mastodon/Dethklok tour. Schafer appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on October 2, 2009 to promote the game. Black appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on October 14, 2009, dressed as Eddie Riggs and staying in character during his interview. A demo version of the game was made available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace and PlayStation Network Store; it was available for a limited time on September 17, 2009 for North American users who had pre-ordered the product through GameStop. The demo became available to all Xbox Live Gold users on September 24, 2009, and to Xbox Live Silver users and all PlayStation 3 users the following week. The demo is based on the game's beginning, showing Eddie's arrival and his encounters up until the first boss character fight. Soundtrack Br√ºtal Legend features 107 heavy metal tracks from 75 different bands, selected by Schafer and Music Director Emily Ridgway, each song being a \\"completely sincere choice\\" by Schafer and Ridgway, with the whole track list being \\"designed to be loved by Metal fans.\\" Schafer sought to include songs from most main subgenres of metal, including classic heavy metal, industrial metal, black metal, and doom metal, with each faction in the game favoring a specific type. Though Schafer and others on the Double Fine team had vast knowledge of specific types of metal, Ridgway turned to a used-CD store owner named Allan from Aquarius Records who had \\"encyclopedic knowledge\\" of the entire genre, and who provided the team with sample CDs to help them discover some of the more obscure metal bands. Schafer had identified many of the more well-known songs on the list, while Ridgway was able to locate mission- appropriate, more obscure titles for inclusion; for example, one mission, given by the Killmaster (voiced by Lemmy Kilmister), involves rescuing female troops for Ironheade's army; Ridgway had been able to locate a cover of \\"Bomber\\", originally recorded by Mot√∂rhead (Kilmister's band) and performed by the all-female metal band Girlschool, recorded in their 1981 split EP St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Schafer also credits Black with some of the music selections for the game. Instead of relying on labels or bands to provide them with a list of possible songs to select from, the development team sought permission to use specific songs they wanted in the game. In some cases, obtaining appropriate licensing proved difficult, as for songs from bands that had long split up, Double Fine needed to contact each band member to gain permission. This proved to be valuable, as some original bands were excited about their music being used in the game; in one case, Lita Ford was able to provide the game with a song with slight modifications to the lyrics from a version that she was about to release. One song is from the in-game band \\"Kabbage Boy\\" for which Eddie is a roadie at the start of the game. Schafer had tried to get music from groups like Metallica and AC/DC, but their licensing fees were too high. He further tried to work with Iron Maiden, but the group was hesitant to participate after recognizing that the character name \\"Eddie Riggs\\" suggested an attachment with the band's mascot, named \\"Eddie\\" and designed by Derek Riggs; the band's marketing group pointed out that this could imply that Iron Maiden had endorsed the game. In addition to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long-term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band to tie in with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other \\"real\\" drums (6 tracks) were played by Y&T; drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer would like to have a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not sure if it would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs‚Äî\\"We Are The Road Crew\\" by Mot√∂rhead, \\"The Metal\\" by Tenacious D, and \\"More Than Meets The Eye\\" by Testament‚Äîto appear in a pack of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Br√ºtal Legend's release. The full soundtrack remained intact for Br√ºtal Legends addition to the Xbox One backwards comparability catalog in September 2018; Double Fine had assured all music licensing rights had remains in place for this release. Reception Br√ºtal Legend received positive response from gaming journalists, with reviewers praising the story and characters of the game, and driven vocal performances of the voice actors, particularly Black and Osbourne. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt Black was \\"completely committed\\" to the role of Riggs, while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis found it relieving that Black reined in his typical \\"loud-talking heavy-metal goofball\\" act that he is known for and instead performed well, \\"bringing just the right amount of working-man's matter-of-fact-ness to the role\\". Osbourne's role was considered \\"amazing (and surprisingly coherent)\\" by GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini and \\"played brilliantly\\" by Computer and Video Games' Andrew Kelly. The full cast was commended for their roles; the heavy metal musicians were effective at playing themselves in the game, while the other voice talent performed well and \\"[did] their part to balance out the star power\\" in the game. The strength of the characters was considered to be enhanced by the quality of writing of the story, and the use of facial animation. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan considered the characters of Br√ºtal Legend to be the strongest aspect to the game, distancing the title from other video games due to \\"rounded, personable leads who are distinctly superior to the usual throngs of cybermen and super-vixens\\", and a facet of Schafer's signature work. Wired's Chris Kohler further attested the strength of the game's story to Schafer's skill, considering that \\"After Br√ºtal Legend, he should be considered one of the best storytellers in gaming, period.\\" 1UP.com's Justin Haywald noted that the game lacks the ability to review cutscenes, forcing the player to restart the story if they wanted to see these again. The heavy metal-inspired world of Br√ºtal Legend was also well received, and considered to show a clear reverence for the genre. Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be \\"dedicated to an unabashed love of metal\\" and \\"heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree\\". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements that made up the heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being \\"both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass\\" at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game may not be the most sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that \\"no matter where you are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at\\", while Donlan considered the world to be a \\"constant unfolding delight\\". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's \\"Through the Fire and Flames\\" would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have \\"enormous breadth of sound and diversity\\", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of \\"taking a class in heavy metal appreciation.\\" The actual gameplay was seen as Br√ºtal Legend largest weakness. Many reviewers were critical of the incorporation of real-time strategy (RTS) elements into the game, a fact that was not well advertised prior to the game's release and does not become apparent to the player in the first hours of the game. Though Schafer had set out to make the console-based game like an RTS from the start, they were warned by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts that \\"RTS\\" was \\"a naughty word in the console space\\", and instead marketed it as an action game. Despite this, reviewers found that the game was still difficult to play on a console due to the selected controls that made it difficult to target objectives or troops, the lack of a mini-map to track friends and foes, and the frantic pace of battle. Critics did appreciate the slow introduction to the various aspects of the game as part of the single player game, but felt the game did not adequately introduce or explain all of the game's RTS features, such as the ability to mount a final stand on one's stage. Some also considered the single-player campaign Stage Battles to be too easy, winnable by brute force, and that more advanced tactics would only become apparent as one played in multiplayer games, including learning the abilities and advantages of the other units of the factions other than Ironheade. The mix of gaming genres between the RTS and third-person action was found particularly confusing; Kohler commented that the handling of the individual genres was accomplished well, leading to \\"an astoundingly complex design instead of a simple one\\" that diminished the enjoyment of the game, while Davis considered that \\"perhaps there wasn't enough confidence in any one piece to let it carry the whole game\\". However, some felt that the various genres helped to create \\"a variety of gameplay opportunities\\", and made for \\"rather elegant\\" Stage Battles. In retrospect, Schafer lamented that they did not include enough tutorials in the game to guide the player as to \\"naturally how to play the strategy part a bit better\\", as they had come to accept over the years of development, and tried to use the Double Fine blog to explain some of these aspects. Though some critics argued that stripping out the RTS elements and leaving an action combat game wrapped in the metal-themed world would have been a better game, Schafer countered that this would have not been true to the vision that he had from the start. Schafer would later jokingly refer to the RTS elements of Br√ºtal Legend; during the fundraising for Broken Age, Schafer teasingly threatened to add RTS elements to the point-and-click if the funding had reached certain levels. Gameplay outside of the Stage Battles was also met with mixed impressions. Most considered the side missions highly repetitive, which included mission types that are generally disliked by gamers, such as escort missions. The lack of a mini-map, replaced by either following a glowing light from the sky illuminating the player's target or by navigating based on the Deuce's turn signals, was criticized for making it difficult to explore the game's world. The information about the world that players can access in the game's pause menu was also found to be lacking, neither showing the collectible elements of the game on the main map, nor easily identifying the alliance of the various troops in the in-game guidebook. Though Eddie gains the ability to fly during Stage Battles, the inability to use this or to make the character jump led to reviewers getting the character stuck on the landscape at times when exploring. Some reviewers found the number of progress checkpoints in the game to be lacking, requiring the player to repeat a long mission if they should die before reaching one. The single-player game was also considered to be short, lasting as little as four hours if one only completed the main story missions. In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Eddie Riggs as the 48th-top video game character of all time. =Sales= According to the NPD Group, Br√ºtal Legend sold approximately 215,000 copies in the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, making it the 12th- top-selling game in that month. These numbers were not considered to be strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Br√ºtal Legend's soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small. =Awards= Black was given the Best Voice award at the Spike Video Game Awards 2009. Br√ºtal Legend won the \\"Best Strategy/Simulation Game\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack\\" awards in the 13th-annual Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and was nominated for \\"Outstanding Character Performance\\" (for Eddie Riggs), \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Story\\", and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction\\". The game was also nominated for the Game Developers Choice Awards for \\"Best Writing\\" and \\"Best Audio\\".

He continued to serve the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. He fought in the Peninsular War and led a tenacious defense of San Sebasti√°n, Spain in 1813. His is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe. Early career In 1784 at the age of 16, Rey joined the French royal army's Regiment de Monsieur, which became the 75th Line Infantry Regiment in 1791. Promoted to sergeant-major in 1791, he earned a lieutenant's commission in 1792.Mulli√©, Louis Emmanuel Rey From that year, he served four years in the Army of the Alps with distinction and won promotion to general of brigade in 1796.Chandler, p 377 For a time, he commanded a camp at Lyon that reorganized units passing from the Vend√©e to the Army of Italy. Empire When the Grande Arm√©e left the shores of the English Channel to fight in the War of the Third Coalition, Rey was given command of the Camp de Boulogne from 1805 to 1808. In the latter year he was named a Baron of the Empire. He served as chief of staff in Laurent Gouvion Saint- Cyr's VII Corps in Catalonia beginning in August 1808. It is likely that he commanded a brigade at the Battle of Oca√±a in November 1809. One source stated that Rey led 3,500 men in six battalions.Gates, p 494. The other possible candidates are Gabriel Venance Rey and Jean Pierre Antoine Rey. It is probable that his brigade included three battalions each of the 12th Light and 43rd Line Infantry Regiments.Smith, 335. This source's battalion numbers were used, though Rey's name was not listed.Zimmermann, 25. This source suggested the probable composition of Rey's brigade, but credited the 12th Light with four battalions. At the Battle of Baza on 4 November 1810, he led a brigade from Horace Sebastiani de la Porta's 1st Division of the IV Corps consisting of one battalion of the 32nd Line Infantry Regiment and three battalions of the 58th Line.Smith, p 348 He fought at the Siege of Tarragona in 1811. Historian David G. Chandler noted that Rey was appointed governor of the fortress of San Sebasti√°n in August 1811. Another source asserted that Rey was defeated by Francisco Ballesteros at Alhaur√≠n el Grande on 14 April 1812. On this occasion he led a force of 3,000 men made up of three squadrons of the 21st Dragoon Regiment, two artillery pieces, and three battalions divided between the 43rd and 58th Line Infantry Regiments. French losses numbered 200 and included both guns.Smith, p 378. The fact that Rey commanded the 58th Line at both Baza and Alhaur√≠n suggests that this was the same general and that Chandler either had the wrong date or that one of the other Reys may have been involved. From 5 July to 9 September 1813 Rey conducted an extremely able defense of San Sebasti√°n.Glover, p 259-262. Glover gives many details of the siege, but fails to mention Rey. In relating the story of the siege, Historian David Gates called Rey, \\"a commander of the first order.\\"Gates, p 394 The army of the Marquess of Wellington shipped 40 heavy siege cannon and large quantities of supplies to the nearby port of Pasajes in early July. Wellington assigned Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch the British 5th Division and a Portuguese brigade to undertake the siege operation.Gates, p 392 An attempt to rush an outlying defense, the San Bartholom√© Monastery, failed on 15 July. A heavier bombardment and attack pried the French defenders from the monastery two days later, but the Allied infantry gave chase and were bloodily repulsed with 200 casualties at the main defenses. The Anglo-Portuguese siege guns went to work and opened a small breach on the east side. Meanwhile, the British engineers discovered an old sewer which they utilized to place a mine under the southern defenses. Rey sealed off the breach with internal defenses, manned the nearby buildings with marksmen, and zeroed in his artillery on the threatened area. At dawn on 25 July, Graham's attack went forward. The mine exploded, doing some damage, but the French easily drove off the southern Allied attack, which was only a diversion. Led by the Royal Scots, the main column splashed across the Rio Urumea estuary at low tide and assaulted the breach from the east. After the attackers reached the top of the breach, the French opened fire and the result was a massacre. The stunned British infantry stampeded, carrying away their supporting battalions. The attackers suffered a loss of 600 killed and wounded, while French casualties were only one-tenth as great. When the incoming tide threatened to drown the many British wounded, Rey generously allowed his soldiers to leave their defenses and rescue them.Gates, pp 394-395 The onset of the Battle of the Pyrenees that day caused Wellington to order Graham to abandon the siege.Gates, p 396 As the Allies withdrew their siege guns, Rey launched a surprise sortie that inflicted 200 more casualties and seized some equipment. Shaken by their setbacks, Allied morale dropped and desertion became a problem.Gates, p 422 This panoramic view shows San Sebastien from the west. Atop the headland at left center is the La Mota Castle, Rey's last place of refuge. During the interlude, Rey repaired his southern defenses and thoroughly sealed off the breach with a new wall. He also shipped in fresh troops and supplies through the leaky British naval blockade and sent his sick and wounded soldiers back to France. Rey awaited a return of the Allies with 3,000 infantry and 60 cannon. After defeating the French in the Pyrenees, Graham rearmed his siege batteries, which now numbered 63 heavy guns. On 26 August the bombardment began again and lasted for five days. The Allied artillery knocked out gun after gun and inflicted serious losses among the defenders. The bombardment blasted a 300-yard wide gap in the wall at the southeast corner of the city, plus a second breach farther north. Faced with the loss of most of his cannon, Rey armed each of his 2,500 surviving soldiers with three muskets and grenades. Several defensive mines were placed and rubble cleared from the breaches.Gates, p 424 The final assault began at 10:55 am on 31 August when James Leith's 5th Division rushed the main breach from the south while Thomas Bradford's Portuguese brigade stormed the smaller one from the east.Gates, pp 424-425 After running the gauntlet of mines and small-arms fire, both columns reached the tops of their respective breaches and came under murderous fire. After enduring the one- sided slaughter for nearly 30 minutes, both columns retreated to the base of the wall where the troops hugged the ground to escape the intense fire. In this emergency, Graham ordered his siege guns to fire over the heads of the surviving attackers. This expedient saved the day for the Allies, as the fire ripped apart the inner defenses, inflicting heavy losses on the French. As some of the 5th Division managed to make progress, an accident set off a store of bombs, killing 60 Frenchmen and injuring many more.Gates, p 425 Leith's men pushed along the walls toward the lesser breach where they assisted the Portuguese in breaking through. Still undefeated, Rey led his men in a house- to-house battle that finally ended when he and his remaining 1,300 troops took refuge in the La Mota Castle. Meanwhile, the Allied troops went berserk and sacked the city for three days in which the place was virtually destroyed. Ensconced in his hilltop castle, Rey held out against a 60-gun bombardment until 8 September when he finally ran up the white flag.Gates, pp 425-426 Before being forced to surrender the survivors of his garrison, his soldiers inflicted over 5,000 casualties on their enemies, including Leith who was wounded.Smith, p 448-449 As a reward for his meritorious services, Emperor Napoleon I of France promoted Rey to general of division in November 1813 even though he was a prisoner of war. Historians differ when describing Rey's 1814 service. David G. Chandler writes that he remained in British custody until May 1814. Digby Smith places a General Rey in command of a brigade in Eloi Charlemagne Taupin's division at the battles of OrthezSmith, p 500 and Toulouse in early 1814.Smith, p 518. A number of other generals named Rey fought in the French army. During the Hundred Days Rey rallied to Napoleon and was given command of the fortress of Valenciennes. He sustained a siege by 9,000 Dutch-Belgian troops from 30 June until surrendering on 12 August.Smith, p 557. Smith misspells the name Roy. After the restoration of the monarchy, he fell out of favor until 1830, when he received a three-year appointment to a royal commission.

Amoskeag Mfg. Co., 113 U.S. 9 (1885), was a U.S. Supreme Court case considering whether a dam constructed on privately owned land served a public purpose and whether having the owner of the dam compensate any adjacent landowner was a legal form of eminent domain. Background The state of New Hampshire passed a General Mills Act in 1868 which established a permitting process for companies to build dams on non-navigable waterways so long as they compensated any adjacent landowners for flooded property. Head v. Amoskeag Mfg Co, 113 U.S. 9 (1885) Justia.com The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company dammed the Merrimack River at Amoskeag Falls for the purpose of powering their cotton mills. This had the inadvertent result of flooding Head's land along the river for which he was offered compensation. Head sued claiming the benefit to the company was not a public purpose and that the Equal Protection Clause was being violated because the rights of a major employer was outweighing those of a smaller landowner. When the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that the dam was legal, Head appealed to the federal courts for a writ of error to reverse the judgment. Decision Justice Horace Gray, delivered the opinion of the court that regulating riparian water rights was clearly within the purview of the state, that similar regulations were used in other states, that similar laws in New Hampshire went back to 1718, and that the remedy for any financial loss showed that due process of law was being preserved. The court did not find the equal protection claims compelling. Therefore, the court ruled in favor of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. There were no concurring or dissenting opinions but Justice Samuel Blatchford did not participate in the case.

Throughout his career, the Texas-born virtuoso retained a loyal following. Other pianists admired his musicianship, while several studied with him privately and/or attended his summer master-classes in Southern California. In an effort to tear down barriers that can exist between classical performers and their audiences, Kochanski's concerts mixed humorous stories with classical music selections. Kochanski advertised himself as a \\"classical music entertainer\\". Career notes During his six years at Juilliard, Kochanski studied with Eduard Steuermann (1892-1964), and briefly with Rosina Lh√©vinne (1880-1976) who was also Van Cliburn‚Äôs teacher at the time.Mason & Hamblin - eNews: Kochanski records favorite classics for PianoDisc Shortly before completing studies at Juilliard, Kochanski was stricken with chronic internal bleeding, which caused the pianist to be hospitalized for three years. With a financial inheritance from Dr. Della Pennington (the doctor who helped restore his health), Kochanski formed the Della Moser Pennington Foundation (a non- profit corporation founded solely for the purpose of giving financial aid to gifted young musicians), which was subsequently dissolved. Kochanski did not begin to construct a concert career until he was approaching forty-years old. The guiding reference in shaping his professional persona and name was the legendary Polish pianist, Ignacy Jan Paderewski (1860-1941). Kochanski initially embarked upon a career using his birth-name, Robert Harvey. His first album, \\"Robert Harvey Plays Your Favorite Piano Classics\\" and a handbook for students, \\"The Magic Key to Keyboard Success,\\" were produced under his given name. Although not of Polish ancestry, his sympathetic identification with Poland inspired Harvey to change his name in the 1970s. Thus, the pianist reintroduced himself as Wladimir Jan Kochanski with his autobiography, \\"The People's Pianist.\\" Throughout the remainder of his concert/recording career, the pianist was known as Kochanski. He also converted to Mormonism, the religion of his manager, and thereafter played extensively for Mormon audiences.Mother Earth News, September/October 1981, Newsworthies: Briefs on Frank Serpico, Wladimir Jan Kochanski, Robert Nara. On numerous occasions, Kochanski played for notables, including a private concert for Pope John Paul II,Baldwin Artists as well as performances on television shows such as The 700 Club, Hour Magazine, Good Morning America and Voice of America. His autobiography, The People's Pianist was published in 1981 by Crown Summit Books.The People's Pianist, by Wladimir Jan KochanskiThe People's Pianist, by Wladimir Jan Kochanski Besides his music, he gained publicity by drawing attention to the welfare of needy Poles within Poland, for which he has received the Order of Polonia Restituta.NOTES ON PEOPLE; A Personal Touch in Helping Needy Poles by LESLIE BENNETTS AND DOROTHY J. GAITER (NYT) Proteges and pupils Kochanski taught casually for many years although none of his students have achieved recognition in the classical music world. Among his various students was pop-singer Christine Anderson. Kochanski seldom taught strictly piano technique, but lectured primarily in broad terms about music inspiration. This was especially true of his master-classes as students often attended in-conjunction with instruction from their own private teachers.\\"...the quintessential child prodigy\\"Spencer Huston Biography Awards and recognitions * He is a Baldwin Notable Artist, also appearing as a PianoDisc popular artistWladimir Jan Kochanski - One of PianoDisc's most popular artists * Order of Polonia Restituta Personal life In his autobiography, Kochanski claimed to have been previously married and widowed; however, public records documenting this union or the existence of a spouse have not been located. In 2003, due to an unsuccessful operation on his lower back, Kochanski was forced into early retirement. At that time, he relocated to the desert of Southern California, where he spent the remainder of his life. On 24 March 2015, Kochanski died after suffering a heart attack. His body was interred at Glen Abbey Memorial Park in Bonita, California.

While soft-spoken and shy, Tucker made his presence known through his unique and clearly recognizable guitar style. Tucker helped to define the music known as Chicago Blues, but played everything from blues to soul, rock, jazz and gospel, when given the chance. While never achieving the fame and notoriety of some of his contemporaries he was considered a great guitarist whether playing his own lead style or playing on the recordings of B.B. King, Mel Brown, Pat Hare, or Elmore James. He is considered one of the most prominent rhythm guitarists of Chicago Blues along with Eddie Taylor, Jody Williams and Freddie Robinson. He variously worked with Little Walter, Otis Rush, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, The James Cotton Blues Band and Elvin Bishop. Career =Early years= Tucker was born in Memphis, Tennessee. His father, a carpenter, built Tucker his first guitar, but his first real guitar was a Sears Silvertone that his mother got him to keep him out of trouble. His mother, who played boogie-woogie piano, introduced him to Big Bill Broonzy and to Robert Lockwood Jr., the stepson to Robert Johnson, usually acknowledged as \\"King of the Delta Blues\\". Tucker went on to become Robert Jr.'s prot√©g√©, a guitarist and an individual for whom he had the greatest admiration and respect. In fact, Tucker always referred to him as \\"Mr. Robert Jr. Lockwood\\". Tucker's family moved from Memphis to Chicago when he was a teenager and his teenage contemporaries and friends with whom he traded licks, shared ideas and played included Freddie King, Magic Sam and Otis Rush. Luther Tucker in France, in 1980 Playing with bands In 1952 he began playing with his uncle, J.T. \\"Boogie\\" Brown, saxophonist, studio musician, and sideman to slide guitarist, Elmore James. Tucker was soon back with Mr. Robert Jr. Lockwood, who was one of the most sought after sidemen and studio guitarists on the Chicago blues scene. Robert Jr. went to the musician's union asking that Tucker be allowed to play in clubs, and reassured the Union that he would act as a guardian to him and keep the 16-year-old Tucker out of trouble. Robert Jr., who was capable of playing Delta Blues had been B.B. King's rhythm guitarist in 1948-1949 and brought a unique jazz style to (the new style known as) Chicago Blues. A tough task master, Robert Jr. drilled into Tucker everything from minor diminished ninth and thirteenth chords to big bar-chords and the subtle nuances of jazz guitar. Initially, Robert Jr. played lead guitar and Tucker played bass on a tuned-down six-string guitar (the Fender bass had not yet been invented) or Tucker would play rhythm guitar. Tucker learned to read music and began working as a studio guitarist at an early age. If someone wanted Robert Jr., they also got Tucker as part of the package. They worked with Little Walter off and on for seven years. First, as part of a twosome with Robert Jr., and later as a lead guitarist, Tucker recorded on numerous classic sides behind Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Jimmy Rogers, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. He also recorded with Otis Rush, Snooky Pryor, and after moving to the West Coast, John Lee Hooker, Robben Ford, and Elvin Bishop. In the late 1960s Tucker had been working in Muddy Waters' band along with harmonica player, James Cotton, and drummer, Francis Clay. In 1968, a cooperative band was put together composed of Tucker on guitar; drummer, Sam Lay (best known for his work with Paul Butterfield); bassist and alumni of Howlin' Wolf's band, Bobby Anderson; Alberto Gianquinto, a pianist equally comfortable playing jazz, blues or classical music; and harmonica man and singer, James Cotton. First night out, the emcee at the club asked the band's name so he could announce them. For lack of a name, one of the band said, The James Cotton Blues Band. The name stuck. After a while, Sam Lay was replaced by Francis Clay. Clay, a veteran of Dizzy Gillespie's and Cab Calloway's big bands, Jay McShann's group and Muddy Water's band, brought a new dimension to the band and Tucker further developed his skills, playing soul tunes and jazz arrangements, utilizing the octave, minor and diminished chords he had learned from Robert Jr. The group traveled the country from Fillmore West, in San Francisco to Fillmore East in New York, and on to Great Britain, Europe and other points, sharing the stage with the biggest rock acts of the 1960s and 70's. The band spent a great deal of time in Northern California and in 1973 Tucker left The James Cotton Blues Band and relocated to the town of San Anselmo, California. For several years he worked with John Lee Hooker's band, Grayson Street Houserockers, L.C. \\"Good Rockin'\\" Robinson, and as a house musician at Clifford Antone's club in Austin, Texas. He finally formed the Luther Tucker Band where he also became known as a very competent and soulful singer. He played in clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area until his death. Tucker played at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1973, 1976, and 1979. He would also play as part of supporting bands behind visiting friends and bluesmen including Fenton Robinson, Freddie King and Jimmy Reed. Luther Tucker died of a heart attack in June, 1993 in Greenbrae, California, at the age of 57. His body was returned to Chicago, where he is buried in Restvale Cemetery in an unmarked plot. He recorded two albums, one incomplete, both released posthumously. On May 9, 2009 the second annual White Lake Blues Festival took place at the Howmet Playhouse Theater in Whitehall, Michigan. The concert was organized by executive producer, Steve Salter, of the nonprofit organization Killer Blues to raise monies to honor Tucker's unmarked grave with a headstone. The event was a success, and a headstone was placed in June, 2009.

This means everyone in the community gets a chance to contribute to the planning process. * Require that all plans and actions are based on sound science. This legislation sets out a basic framework for the establishment of community-based groups that represent a cross-section of sectors and geographic areas within Conservation Authority (Canada) boundaries.

He won the 1977 BAFTA Award for Best Editing for his work on Annie Hall, and published an influential memoir When the Shooting Stops, the Cutting Begins: A Film Editor's Story. Life and career Towards the end of the World War II in 1945, Rosenblum worked as a filmmaking apprentice in the U.S. Office of War Information; among his mentors there were Sidney Meyers and Helen van Dongen. Following the war he became van Dongen's assistant while she was editing Robert Flaherty's film Louisiana Story (1948), and was credited as an editor on Of Human Rights (1950), which van Dongen produced and directed. 20 minute film. Screenplay: Joseph Moncure March. Editor: Ralph Rosenblum. Cast: Dorothy Peterson, Howard Wierum, William E. Hawley. Much of Rosenblum's work in the 1950s and early 1960s was in television; he worked on shows such as The Search, Omnibus, The Guy Lombardo Show, and The Patty Duke Show. With Sid Katz and Gene Milford, he formed a company, MKR Films, that provided editorial services for television shows, spots, and corporate films. In the 1960s, Rosenblum edited four films directed by Sidney Lumet, starting with Long Day's Journey into Night (1962). These films, which were all serious dramas, were very important to Rosenblum's career; as John Gallagher has noted, Paul Monaco has summarized Rosenblum's editing innovations on The Pawnbroker, as well as their influence, as follows, \\"In his work on The Pawnbroker, Rosenblum imitated devices from several French films of the previous decade, but he also extended them. Like Dede Allen, Rosenblum broke editing conventions and rules. More importantly, and like her also, his innovations shifted editing away from its traditional reliance on telling a story to the creation of a new and penetrating subjectivity in the feature film.\\" In 1966, Rosenblum was nominated for an American Cinema Editors \\"Eddie\\" award (Best Editing of a Feature Film) for A Thousand Clowns (1965), which was directed by Fred Coe. In 1968, Rosenblum was hired as an \\"editorial consultant\\" to help a young Woody Allen hone a large amount of footage into what became Allen's first film, the mockumentary Take the Money and Run. Rosenblum went on to edit the next five of Allen's films, including Annie Hall, for which he won the 1977 BAFTA Award for Best Editing with Wendy Greene Bricmont. Interiors (1978) was Rosenblum's last film with Allen. Rosenblum and Allen came to a mutual decision that Rosenblum would not edit Manhattan. Susan E. Morse, who had been Rosenblum's assistant editor on several of Allen's films, became his successor and edited Allen's films for the ensuing twenty years. For the last film, Interiors, Allen was actively involved in the editing and was fearful concerning the reception of the film. Allen's biographer Eric Lax quoted Rosenblum about the film: alt=Artwork that looks like several frames of a strip of movie film with sprocket holes along its sides. The strip looks like it was cut near its middle, and the lower portion is angled about 20 degrees from the upper portion. In the frame of the upper section are the words \\"WHEN THE SHOOTING STOPS\\". The lower frame has a photograph, possibly of Diane Keaton and Woody Allen from Annie Hall, and then the words \\"THE CUTTING BEGINS\\". The text continues, in a smaller font, \\"A Film Editor's Story\\" and \\"Ralph Rosenblum and Robert Karen\\" In 1979, Rosenblum published a book written with Robert Karen, When the Shooting Stops, the Cutting Begins: A Film Editor's Story. Gallagher described the importance of this book as follows: According to his widow, Davida Rosenblum, \\"He was an autodidact, especially when it came to his prodigious knowledge of music, and used both jazz and classical music as temporary or permanent scores in many of the films he edited. Many of the composers exposed to his temporary tracks used them as a guide.\\" Rosenblum worked as a director for about five years, commencing with the documentary film Acting Out (1980). His films included Summer Solstice (1981), which was made for television and which was actor Henry Fonda's last film. Later years For the last eight years of his life, Rosenblum taught film and film editing at Columbia University as a Full Professor of Film Directing despite having not attended college himself. In his final decade, Rosenblum taught editing at the International Film and Television Workshops in Rockport, Maine. For the final four years, he was also an Artist in Residence. Rosenblum had been selected as a member of the American Cinema Editors.Members of the American Cinema Editors are often credited with the title \\"A.C.E.\\".

Their study belongs in the field of epidemiology. Breast cancer, like other forms of cancer, can result from multiple environmental and hereditary risk factors. The term \\"environmental\\", as used by cancer researchers, means any risk factor that is not genetically inherited. For breast cancer, the list of environmental risk factors includes the individual person's development, exposure to microbes, \\"medical interventions, dietary exposures to nutrients, energy and toxicants, ionizing radiation, and chemicals from industrial and agricultural processes and from consumer products...reproductive choices, energy balance, adult weight gain, body fatness, voluntary and involuntary physical activity, medical care, exposure to tobacco smoke and alcohol, and occupational exposures, including shift work\\" as well as \\"metabolic and physiologic processes that modify the body's internal environment.\\" Some of these environmental factors are part of the physical environment, while others (such as diet and number of pregnancies) are primarily part of the social, cultural, or economic environment. Although many epidemiological risk factors have been identified, the cause of any individual breast cancer is most often unknowable. Epidemiological research informs the patterns of breast cancer incidence across certain populations, but not in a given individual. Approximately 5% of new breast cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes, and well-established risk factors accounts for approximately 30% of cases. Age incidence by age among women in the UK 2006-2008.Excel chart for Figure 1.1: Breast Cancer (C50), Average Number of New Cases per Year and Age-Specific Incidence Rates, UK, 2006-2008 at Breast cancer - UK incidence statistics at Cancer Research UK. Section updated 18/07/11. The risk of getting breast cancer increases with age. A woman is more than 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer in her 60s than in her 20s. If all women lived to age 95, about one in eight would be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lives. However, the actual lifetime risk is lower than that, because 90% of women die before age 95, most commonly from heart attacks, strokes, or other forms of cancer. The probability of breast cancer increases with age, but breast cancer tends to be more aggressive in younger people. Sex Male individuals have a much lower risk of developing breast cancer than females. In developed countries, about 99% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in female patients; in a few African countries, which represent the highest incidence of male breast cancer, males account for 5‚Äì15% of cases. The rate of male breast cancer appears to be rising somewhat. Male breast cancer patients tend to be older than female ones. They are more likely to be diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive tumors, with about six out of seven cases being estrogen-receptor positive. The overall prognosis is worse for male than for female patients. Heredity United Kingdom being a member of the International Cancer Genome Consortium is leading efforts to map breast cancer's complete genome. =BRCA1 and BRCA2= In 5% of breast cancer cases, there is a strong inherited familial risk. Two autosomal dominant genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for most of the cases of familial breast cancer. Women who carry a harmful BRCA mutation have a 60% to 80% risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetimes. Other associated malignancies include ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. If a mother or a sister was diagnosed breast cancer, the risk of a hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation is about 2-fold higher than those women without a familial history. Commercial testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations has been available in most developed countries since at least 2004. In addition to the BRCA genes associated with breast cancer, the presence of NBR2, near breast cancer gene 1, has been discovered, and research into its contribution to breast cancer pathogenesis is ongoing. =Other genes= Hereditary non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 breast tumors (and even some sporadic carcinomas) are believed to result from the expression of weakly penetrant but highly prevalent mutations in various genes. For instance, polymorphism has been identified in genes associated to the metabolism of estrogens and/or carcinogens (Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1, CYP1B1, CYP17A1, CYP19, Catechol-O- methyltransferase, N-acetyltransferase 2, Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1, GSTP1, GSTT, . . . ), to estrogen, androgen and vitamin D action (ESR1, AR, VDR), to co-activation of gene transcription (AIB1), to DNA damage response pathways (CHEK2, HRAS1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC5). Sequence variants of these genes that are relatively common in the population may be associated with a small to moderate increased relative risk for breast cancer. Combinations of such variants could lead to multiplicative effects. Sporadic cancers likely result from the complex interplay between the expression of low penetrance gene(s) (risk variants) and environmental factors. However, the suspected impact of most of these variants on breast cancer risk should, in most cases, be confirmed in large populations studies. Indeed, low penetrance genes cannot be easily tracked through families, as is true for dominant high-risk genes. Part of the hereditary non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 breast tumors may be associated to rare syndromes, of which breast cancer is only one component. Such syndromes result notably from mutations in TP53 (Li‚ÄìFraumeni syndrome), ATM (ataxia‚Äìtelangiectasia), STK11/LKB1(Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome), PTEN (Cowden syndrome). RAB11FIP1, TP53, PTEN and rs4973768 are also associated with increased risk of breast cancer. rs6504950 is associated with lower risk of breast cancer. Mutations in RAD51C confer an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Prior cancers People who have previously been diagnosed with breast, ovarian, uterine, or bowel cancer have a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mothers of children with soft-tissue sarcoma may have an increased risk of breast cancer. Men with prostate cancer may have an elevated risk of breast cancer, although the absolute risk remains low. Dietary factors =Alcohol= In population studies that do not control for screening incidence drinkers of alcohol have a higher tendency to be diagnosed with breast cancer. For example, a study of more than one million middle-aged British women concluded that each daily alcoholic beverage was associated with the incidence of breast cancer by 11 cases per 1000 women. This means that among a group of 1000 women who drink one alcoholic beverage per day, they will have 11 extra cases of breast cancer when compared to a group of women who drink less than one alcoholic beverage per week; a group of 1000 women who have four drinks per day will have an extra 44 cases of breast cancer compared to non-drinkers. One or two drinks each day increases the relative risk to 150% of normal, and six drinks per day increases the risk to 330% of normal. However, studies of mortality show that drinkers have no greater risk of dying from breast cancer. An analysis of various causes of death of middle aged and elderly Americans found that, of the 251,420 women in the study, 0.3% of the zero and super-light drinkers died from breast cancer, over the 10 years of study observation. And exactly the same proportion, 0.3%, of the moderate to heavy drinkers (1 to 4+ drinks per day). In another mortality study of 85,000 women, the chance of death from breast cancer during the 12 year follow-up period was 0.4%, and again this was identical for zero- to-super-light drinkers as with moderate-to-heavy drinkers. This paradoxical difference between the results for diagnoses and those for mortality appears to be due to drinkers screening more for breast cancer potential reasons for the higher rates of screening among drinkers are because they are wealthier, more urban, more health conscious, closer to screening clinics. Studies that control for screening rates show no association between drinking and being diagnosed with breast cancer. Meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies looking at drinking and breast cancer mortality/survival after diagnosis shows no association between levels of drinking (before or after diagnosis) and risk of breast cancer death, nor reoccurrence of the cancer. Two recent studies looking at patients already diagnosed with breast cancer both found that women who drank before their breast cancer diagnosis had no higher risk of dying from the cancer than the non-drinkers. Similarly a large study with long follow-up of women with breast cancer showed breast cancer patients had better chances of survival if they were regular drinkers before diagnosis. If they altered their drinking after diagnosis this did not alter their chance of dying from breast cancer. But an increase in drinking was associated with an overall improvement in life expectancy (largely due to substantially fewer heart disease deaths among those who increased their alcohol consumption). = Fat intake = Dietary influences have been examined for decades with conflicting results and have so far failed to confirm any significant link. One recent study suggests that low-fat diets may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer as well as the recurrence of breast cancer. Another study showed no contribution of dietary fat intake on the incidence of breast cancer in over 300,000 women. A randomized, controlled study of the consequences of a low-fat diet, carried out as part of the Women's Health Initiative, failed to show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer incidence in the group assigned a low-fat diet, although the authors did find evidence of a benefit in the subgroup of women who followed the low- fat diet in a strict manner. A prospective cohort study, the Nurses' Health Study II, found increased breast cancer incidence in premenopausal women only, with higher intake of animal fat, but not vegetable fat. Taken as a whole, these results point to a possible association between dietary fat intake and breast cancer incidence, though these interactions are hard to measure in large groups of women. = Specific dietary fatty acids = Although many claims have been made in popular literature there is no solid evidence linking specific fats to breast cancer. A study published in 2001 found higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids MUFAs (especially oleic acid) in the erythrocyte membranes of postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer. That same study discussed that a diet high in MUFAs is not the major determinant of erythrocyte membrane MUFAs, where most oleic acid in mammalian tissue is derived from the saturated stearic acid residue. Where key conversion is controlled by the Delta9-desaturase, which also regulates the transformation of the other common saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (myristic and palmitic). The study discussed that fat content of the diet has an important effect on Delta9-d activity, while high levels of SFAs increase Delta9-d activity by twofold to threefold, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease. This conclusion was partially contradicted by a latter study, which showed a direct relation between very high consumption of omega-6 fatty acids (PUFAs) and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. = Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons = Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a known human carcinogens due to their mutagenic ability to damage DNA which causes cancer. A 2016 study found that sources of PAHs such as grilled and smoked meats (along with other sources such as cigarette smoking and indoor air pollution) were associated with 30‚Äì50% increase in breast cancer incidence. High risk individuals were those who were active smokers, consumed greater than 55 servings of grilled/smoked meats a year, frequently used indoor fire places, and were exposed to large amounts of traffic pollution. The study was a population-based case-control study conducted on Long island, New York (N=1,508 breast cancer cases/1,556 controls). The authors concluded that while PAHs are ubiquitous, breast cancer risk factors could be modified by dietary and lifestyle changes. = Phytoestrogens = Phytoestrogens have been extensively studied in animal and human in-vitro and epidemiological studies. Research failed to establish any noticeable benefit and some phytoestrogens may present a breast cancer risk. The literature support the following conclusions: # Plant estrogen intake in early adolescence may protect against breast cancer later in life. # The potential risks of isoflavones on breast tissue in women at high risk for breast cancer is still unclear. =Calcium= Some studies have found a relationship between calcium intake and lowered breast cancer risk. * In the Nurse's Health Study, a high dietary intake of calcium showed 33% lower risk of breast cancer. * Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort Concluded 20% lower risk of breast cancer with 1250 mg of calcium intake. * Women's Health Study shows an inverse association between total calcium intake and premenopausal breast cancer risk. * Another two studies, one in FranceAnn Nutr metab 2007; 51:139-45 and another in Finland, showed significant inverse relation between calcium intake and breast cancer. ;Hypotheses: * Calcium reduces cell proliferation and induces differentiation in mammary glands. * High calcium intake decreases fat-induced epithelial hypoproliferation of mammary gland and chemically induced carcinogenesis. * Breast density is positively associated with breast cancer. Dietary calcium intake reduces the breast density. * High calcium intake is associated with a reduced risk of benign proliferative epithelial disorders which are thought to be precursors of breast cancer. =Vitamin D= Vitamin D is related to reduced risk of breast cancer and disease prognosis. A 2011 study done at the University of Rochester Medical Center found that low vitamin D levels among women with breast cancer correlate with more aggressive tumors and poorer prognosis. The study associated sub-optimal vitamin D levels with poor scores on every major biological marker that helps physicians predict a patient's breast cancer outcome. The lead researcher stated, \\"Based on these results, doctors should strongly consider monitoring vitamin D levels among breast cancer patients and correcting them as needed.\\" ;Hypotheses: * Vitamin D metabolites (25 (OH) D, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D) promote cellular differentiation and it is important for chemoprevention. * Low circulating levels of 25 (OH) D in adolescence may be an important predisposing factor for breast cancer risk in later life. =Brassica vegetables= In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, biomedical investigators found that Brassicas vegetable intake (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprouts) was inversely related to breast cancer development. The relative risk among women in the highest decile of Brassica vegetable consumption (median, 1.5 servings per day) compared to the lowest decile (virtually no consumption) was 0.58. That is, women who consumed around 1.5 servings of Brassica vegetables per day had 42% less risk of developing breast cancer than those who consumed virtually none. =Country diet= A significant environmental effect is likely responsible for the different rates of breast cancer incidence between countries with different dietary customs. Researchers have long measured that breast cancer rates in an immigrant population soon come to resemble the rates of the host country after a few generations. The reason for this is speculated to be immigrant uptake of the host country diet. The prototypical example of this phenomenon is the changing rate of breast cancer after the arrival of Japanese immigrants to America. = Mushrooms = In 2009, a case-control study of the eating habits of 2,018 women suggested that women who consumed mushrooms had an approximately 50% lower incidence of breast cancer. Women who consumed mushrooms and green tea had a 90% lower incidence of breast cancer. A case control study of 362 Korean women also reported an association between mushroom consumption and decreased risk of breast cancer. =Iodine deficiency= The protective effects of iodine on breast cancer have been postulated from epidemiologic evidence and described in animal models. Obesity and Lack of Exercise Gaining weight after menopause can increase a woman's risk. A 2006 study found that putting on 9.9 kg (22 lbs) after menopause increased the risk of developing breast cancer by 18%.BBC report Weight link to breast cancer risk Lack of exercise has been linked to breast cancer by the American Institute for Cancer Research.Nelson Mya (3 November 2011) New Research: Getting Up From Your Desk Can Put the \\"Breaks\\" on Cancer. Experts Urge Americans to Rethink Outdated Notions of Physical Activity American Institute for Cancer Research, Press release from AICR 2011 annual meeting, Retrieved 7 December 2011 Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer by many scientific studies. There is evidence to suggest that excess body fat at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is associated with higher rates of cancer recurrence and death. Furthermore, studies have shown that obese women are more likely to have large tumors, greater lymph node involvement, and poorer breast cancer prognosis with 30% higher risk of mortality. Weight gain after diagnosis has also been linked to higher rates of breast cancer recurrence or mortality although this finding is not consistent. Weight gain is often less severe with newer chemotherapy treatments but one study found a significant risk of breast cancer mortality in women who gained weight compared to those who maintained their weight. However, other cohort studies and recent clinical trials have not shown a significant relationship between weight gain after diagnosis and breast cancer mortality. Weight loss after diagnosis has not been shown to decrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence or mortality. However, physical activity after breast cancer diagnosis has shown some associations with reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality independent of weight loss. Data for both weight loss and physical activity and the effect on breast cancer prognosis is still lacking. There is debate as to whether the higher rate of breast cancer associated with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index‚Äîthis effect was only seen in white women. Obese women are more likely to list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid mammography are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that mammography patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at a healthy weight indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups. Hormones Persistently increased blood levels of estrogen are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, as are increased levels of the androgens androstenedione and testosterone (which can be directly converted by aromatase to the estrogens estrone and estradiol, respectively). Increased blood levels of progesterone are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. A number of circumstances which increase exposure to endogenous estrogens including not having children, delaying first childbirth, not breastfeeding, early menarche (the first menstrual period) and late menopause are suspected of increasing lifetime risk for developing breast cancer. However, not only sex hormones, but also insulin levels are positively associated with the risk of breast cancer. = Pregnancy, childbearing and breastfeeding = Lower age of first childbirth, compared to the average age of 24, having more children (about 7% lowered risk per child), and breastfeeding (4.3% per breastfeeding year, with an average relative risk around 0.7) have all been correlated to lowered breast cancer risk in premenopausal women, but not postmenopausal women, in large studies. Women who give birth and breast-feed by the age of 20 may have even greater protection. In contrast, for instance, having the first live birth after age 30 doubles the risk compared to having first live birth at age less than 25. Never having children triples the risk. The studies have found that these risk factors become less material as a woman reaches menopause, i.e. that they affect risk of breast cancer prior to menopause but not after it. In balancing premenopausal reductions in risk from childbirth and lactation, it is important also to consider the risks involved in having a child. = Hormonal contraception = Hormonal contraceptives may produce a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis among current and recent users, but this appears to be a short-term effect. In 1996 the largest collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found a relative risk (RR) of 1.24 of breast cancer diagnosis among current combined oral contraceptive pill users; 10 or more years after stopping, no difference was seen. Further, the cancers diagnosed in women who had ever used hormonal contraceptives were less advanced than those in nonusers, raising the possibility that the small excess among users was due to increased detection. The relative risk of breast cancer diagnosis associated with current and recent use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to vary with family history of breast cancer. Some studies have suggested that women who began using hormonal contraceptives before the age of 20 or before their first full-term pregnancy are at increased risk for breast cancer, but it is not clear how much of the risk stems from early age at first use, and how much stems from use before the first full-term pregnancy. = Hormone replacement therapy = Data exist from both observational and randomized clinical trials regarding the association between menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative risk of breast cancer of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk. A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy. =Oophorectomy and mastectomy= Prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of ovaries) and mastectomy in individuals with high-risk mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes reduces the risk of developing breast cancer as well as reducing the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Because of a complex balance of benefits and risks of a prophylactic surgery it is recommended only in very specific cases. =Hormonal therapy= Hormonal therapy has been used for chemoprevention in individuals at high risk for breast cancer. Overall it is recommended only in very special circumstances. In 2002, a clinical practice guideline by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that \\"clinicians discuss chemoprevention with women at high risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse effects of chemoprevention\\" with a grade B recommendation. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) The guidelines were based on studies of SERMs from the MORE, BCPT P-1, and Italian trials. In the MORE trial, the relative risk reduction for raloxifene was 76%. The P-1 preventative study demonstrated that tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer in high-risk individuals. The relative risk reduction was up to 50% of new breast cancers, though the cancers prevented were more likely estrogen-receptor positive (this is analogous to the effect of finasteride on the prevention of prostate cancer, in which only low-grade prostate cancers were prevented). The Italian trial showed benefit from tamoxifen. Additional randomized controlled trials have been published since the guidelines. The IBIS trial found benefit from tamoxifen. In 2006, the NSABP STAR trial demonstrated that raloxifene had equal efficacy in preventing breast cancer compared with tamoxifen, but that there were fewer side effects with raloxifene. The RUTH Trial concluded that \\"benefits of raloxifene in reducing the risks of invasive breast cancer and vertebral fracture should be weighed against the increased risks of venous thromboembolism and fatal stroke\\". On September 14, 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration approved raloxifene (Evista) to prevent invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. AFP.google.com, US approves Lilly's Evista for breast cancer prevention =Endocrine disruptors= Many xenoestrogens (industrially made estrogenic compounds) and other endocrine disruptors are potential risk factors of breast cancer. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic form of estrogen. It has been used between the early 1940s and 1971. Pregnant women took DES to prevent certain pregnancy complications. However, it also increased their risk of breast cancer. It also increased the risk of breast cancer in the prenatally exposed daughters after they have reached an age 40 years. Furthermore, there is exposure to endocrine disruptors from the environment, in addition to phytoestrogens mentioned above in the diet section. See xenoestrogens in environmental factors below Factors in the physical environment According to a review, the main mechanisms by which environmental compounds increase breast cancer risk are acting like hormones, especially estrogen, or affecting susceptibility to carcinogenesis. The evidence to date generally supports an association between breast cancer and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Dioxins and organic solvents, on the other hand, have only shown an association in sparse and methodologically limited studies, but are suggestive of an association. Overall, however, evidence is still based on a relatively small number of studies. =Xenoestrogens= Many xenoestrogens (industrially made estrogenic compounds) are endocrine disruptors, and potential risk factors of breast cancer. Endocrine disruption is the hypothesis that some chemicals in the body, such as Bisphenol A, are capable of interfering with the production, processing, and transmission of hormones. A substantial and growing body of evidence indicates that exposures to certain toxic chemicals and hormone-mimicking compounds including chemicals used in pesticides, cosmetics and cleaning products contribute to the development of breast cancer. The increasing prevalence of these substances in the environment may explain the increasing incidence of breast cancer, though direct evidence is sparse. Bisphenol A Exposure to bisphenol A causes breast cancer. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical compound used in the production of plastics found in numerous commercial products, including laptops, baby bottles, food containers, water main pipes, and laboratory and hospital equipment. BPA was first produced in 1891, but its estrogenic properties went undiscovered until the mid-1930s. Today it is considered a xenoestrogen, and it functions as an endocrine disruptor that interferes with hormones in the body and disrupts the normal functioning of the endocrine system. At very low levels the FDA has long considered BPA in food to be safe, but this has been challenged over the years as more information is discovered regarding the effects of the chemical. Rats exposed prenatally to environmentally relevant doses of BPA show an increased number of intraductal hyperplasias (precancerious lesions) in mammary glands that appear during adulthood, while high doses induce the development of carcinomas in breast tissue. Animals exposed to BPA during fetal life develop palpable tumors, and all studies show an increased susceptibility to mammary gland neoplasia that manifests during adulthood. Exposure of mouse dams to environmentally relevant levels of BPA during organogenesis results in considerable alterations in the mammary gland. It was concluded that perinatal exposure to low doses of BPA results in altered mammary gland morphogenesis, induction of precancerous lesions, and carcinoma in situ. A study sought to determine whether early exposure to BPA could accelerate mammary carcinogenesis in a dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) model of rodent mammary cancer. In the study, scientists exposed neonatal/prebubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250 ¬µg BPA/kg body weight/day. For tumorigenesis studies, female offspring were exposed to 30 mg DMBA/kg body weight at 50 days of age. DMBA induces mammary tumors and allows chemicals that predispose for mammary cancer to increase the number of mammary adenocarcinomas. The results of the study showed that female rats in the control, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups administered DMBA exhibited a BPA dose-dependent increase in mammary tumors. The groups had 2.84, 3.82, and 5.00 mammary tumors per rat respectively. Treatment with BPA also reduced tumor latency, with the median tumor latency of 65, 53, and 56.5 days for 0, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups respectively. Maternal exposure to BPA during lactation decreased time to first tumor latency and increased the number of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female offspring. If these effects found in rodents carry over to humans, even minimal exposure to BPA could cause an increased risk for breast cancer. The elevated incidence of breast cancer in women has been associated with prolonged exposure to high levels of estrogens. Xenoestrogens, such as BPA have the capacity to perturb normal hormonal actions. This study provides evidence of the estrogenic effects of BPA. In this study the human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F were treated with 10-3 M, 10-4 M, 10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA continuously for two weeks. The cells treated with 10-3 M BPA died on the second day of treatment. The concentration of 10-4 M BPA was also toxic for the breast epithelial cells, and they died on the fourth day of treatment. This data indicated that these concentrations of BPA are toxic for MCF-10F cells. After the two-week observation period it was seen that the cells formed a high percentage of duct like structures in collagen. MCF-10F cells treated with 10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA formed a high percentage of solid masses, 27% and 20% respectively. This data indicates that BPA is able to induce neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells. Epigenetic changes are involved in the early stages of cancer initiation by altering ductulogenesis. BPA was able to induce transformation of human breast MCF-10F epithelial cells. After treatment with BPA, the cells produced fewer collagen tubules and more solid masses. Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenol A avoid canned food and polycarbonate plastic containers (which shares resin identification code 7 with many other plastics) unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenol A-free. The National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents on plastics, to avoid leaching.FDA Weighs Safety Of Bisphenol A =Aromatic Amines= Aromatic amines are chemicals that are produced when products such as dyes, polyurethane products, and certain pesticides are made. They are also found in cigarette smoke, fuel exhaust, and in over cooked, burned meat. The three types of aromatic amines monocyclic, polycyclic, and heterocyclic have all been found in recent studies of breast health. Monocyclic amines have been found to cause mammary cancer in rats. Studies have shown that women who eat higher amounts of overcooked meat, meaning more exposure to heterocyclic amines, have also been diagnosed with more post-menopausal breast cancer. Heterocyclic amines also have the ability to copy estrogen and in laboratory studies have been found to encourage the growth of cancerous tumors on human tissue.State of the Evidence, The Connection Between Breast Cancer and the Environment, 2008 =Benzene= Multiple studies point to a correlation between benzene exposure and breast cancer risk. Benzene is a petrochemical solvent. Benzene exposure mostly originates from air pollution resulting from industrial burning, exhaust and gas fumes, as well as cigarette smoke. Petroleum, its distillates such as gasoline, auto and truck exhausts also contain benzene. The International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Toxicology Program have labeled benzene as a definite human carcinogen. Multiple studies point to a correlation between benzene exposure and breast cancer risk. Laboratory studies on mice have shown that a high level of benzene exposure can lead to mammary cancer. =DDT= Although the pesticide DDT was banned over 20 years ago, studies have shown that there are still trace amounts found in certain agricultural products, as well as in human and animal milk. While individual studies have come to conflicting conclusions, the most recent reviews of all the evidence conclude that exposure to DDT before puberty increases the risk of breast cancer later in life. =Ethylene oxide= Ethylene oxide is a chemical that can be found in some personal care products, mainly in the form of fragrance. It is also used for the sterilization of various medical objects. The National Toxicology Program has labeled ethylene oxide as a definite human and animal carcinogen. A study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health including 7,576 women found a direct correlation between breast cancer rates and exposure to ethylene oxide during medical sterilization processes. Also, human breast cells put into contact with small amounts of ethylene oxide in a laboratory can lead to DNA damage of the breast tissue. =Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons= Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are chemical products of combustion from coal burners, fuel, cigarette smoke, and various other sources. PAH's are often found in the air and are breathed into the body. PAH's bioaccumulate easily and can copy the estrogen hormone. PAH's can also be genotoxic, meaning they have the ability to harm DNA. =Vinyl chloride= Vinyl chloride is produced when PVC or polyvinyl chloride is made. PVC is found in plastic packaging, outerwear, plastic toys and other plastic products. Vinyl chloride can be found in cigarette smoke and the air around garbage and land fills. It can also be found in the wastewater when PVC is made. The National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have both labeled vinyl chloride as a definite human carcinogen. =Tobacco= Until recently, most studies had not found an increased risk of breast cancer from active tobacco smoking. Beginning in the mid-1990s, a number of studies suggested an increased risk of breast cancer in both active smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke compared to women who reported no exposure to secondhand smoke. By 2005 enough evidence had accumulated for the [California Environmental Protection Agency] to conclude that breathing secondhand smoke causes breast cancer in younger, primarily premenopausal women.California Environmental Protection Agency: Air Resources Board, \\"Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant\\" (June 24, 2005); on January 26, 2006, the Air Resources Board, following a lengthy review and public outreach process, determined ETS to be a Toxic Air Contaminant (TAC). The Agency concluded that the risk was increased by 70%, based on epidemiological studies and the fact that there are many mammary carcinogens in secondhand smoke. The following year (2006) the US Surgeon GeneralU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \\"The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General\\", 2006 identified the same risk increase and concluded that the evidence is \\"suggestive,\\" one step below causal. There is some evidence that exposure to tobacco smoke is most problematic between puberty and first childbirth. The reason is that breast tissue appears most sensitive to chemical carcinogens breast cells not fully differentiated until lactation.J. Russo, I. Russo. \\"Molecular Basis of Breast Cancer: Prevention and Treatment,\\" Springer, 2003 The likely reason that the older studies of active smoking did not detect risks associated with smoking was that they compared active smokers to all nonsmokers (which includes many passive smokers). The newer studies, which exclude passive smokers from the control group, generally show elevated risks associated with active as well as passive smoking. Passive smoking Breathing secondhand smoke increases breast cancer risk by 70% in younger, primarily pre-menopausal women. The California Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that passive smoking causes breast cancer and the US Surgeon General has concluded that the evidence is suggestive, one step below causal. There is some evidence that exposure to tobacco smoke is most problematic between puberty and first childbirth. The reason that breast tissue appears most sensitive to chemical carcinogens in this phase is that breast cells are not fully differentiated until lactation. =Radiation= Women who have received high-dose ionizing radiation to the chest (for example, as treatments for other cancers) have a relative risk of breast cancer between 2.1 and 4.0. The risk increases with increased dose. In addition, the risk is higher in women irradiated before age 30, when there is still breast development. =Dioxins= Dioxins (most notably the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) are chemicals that are produced when chlorinated products are burned, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This occurs when chlorinated products are used in certain manufacturing industries. Dioxins are also added to the air when gasoline and diesel fuels break down. Dioxins are able to bioaccumulate, meaning that they settle and stay in human and animal fat for long periods of time. There are many different types of dioxins and only a few of them have been labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as definite human carcinogens and endocrine hormone disruptors. Although dioxins are floating in the air, they eventually settle on plants and other vegetation surfaces. These plants and vegetation are them eaten by cows and other animals. Humans end up eating the produce, milk, eggs, and meat produced by these animals that have consumed dioxin covered vegetation. Dioxins are more harmful when ingested this way. Multiple studies have led to the idea that increased dioxin levels can increase one's risk for breast cancer. A study done in 1976 after a chemical plant explosion in Seveso, Italy concluded that high dioxin level exposure in a woman's body correlated with a more than double chance of developing breast cancer. =Light at night and disturbance of circadian rhythm= In 1978 Cohen et al. proposed that reduced production of the hormone melatonin might increase the risk of breast cancer and citing \\"environmental lighting\\" as a possible causal factor. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences conducted a study in 2005 that suggests that artificial light during the night can be a factor for breast cancer by disrupting melatonin levels. According to a research in 2008, a reduced melatonin level in postmenopausal women is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer. In 2007, \\"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption\\" was listed as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer. (IARC Press release No. 180). Multiple studies have documented a link between night shift work and the increased incidence of breast cancer. A review of current knowledge of the health consequences of exposure to artificial light at night including the increased incidence of breast cancer and an explanation of the causal mechanisms has been published in the Journal of Pineal Research in 2007. Racial and socioeconomic factors Incidence and mortality vary with race and social status. Incidence rises with improving economic situation, while mortality is tied to low economic status. In the US incidence is significantly lower and mortality higher among black women and this difference appears to persist even after adjustment for economic status. It is currently unclear if significant racial differences in incidence and mortality persist after adjustment for economic status between women of white, Hispanic and Asian origin in the US. Several studies have found that black women in the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer even though white women are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women.Wisconsin Cancer Incidence and Mortality, 2000‚Äì2004 Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services Scholars have advanced several theories for the disparities, including inadequate access to screening, reduced availability of the most advanced surgical and medical techniques, or some biological characteristic of the disease in the African American population.Breast cancer rates differ in races by Amanda Villa Wednesday, October 24, 2007. Badger Herald Some studies suggest that the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes may reflect cultural biases more than biological disease differences. However, the lack of diversity in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment may contribute to these disparities, with recent research indicating that black women are more likely to have estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, which are not responsive to hormone treatments that are effective for most white women. Research is currently ongoing to define the contribution of both biological and cultural factors. Part of the differences in incidence that is attributable to race and economic status may be explained by past use of hormone replacement therapy Factors with inconclusive research =Tea= One research published in 2009 has shown that moderate green tea or black tea consumption (three or more cups per day) can reduce breast cancer risk by 37% in women younger than 50 years old, comparing with women who drank no tea at all. But no association was found for overall women. However that study has been criticized for inaccuracy and another study found no substantial association between breast cancer and tea consumption in the overall, but found a weak inverse association between caffeine-containing beverages and risk of post-menopausal breast cancer. Specifically about green tea, one study has found significant inverse association between risk of breast cancer and green tea intake in Asian women who were low soy consumers. =1,3-Butadiene= 1,3-Butadiene is an environmental factor that can be found in air pollution and can be produced by combustion engines, as well as petroleum refineries. It is found in cigarette smoke and is also used in the making and processing of certain synthetic rubber products and fungicides. The National Toxicology Program has labeled 1,3-Butadiene as definite human carcinogen. The EPA has stated that people are mainly put in contact with this chemical through the means of simple inhalation. =Mammographic density= Mammographic density refers to the relative proportions of radiodense area compared to the radiolucent area on a mammogram, which is basically an x-ray of the breast. The radiodense area on a mammogram is white and is associated with ductal and lobular epithelium, connective tissue and fluid in the breast. The radiolucent area is dark gray or black and is associated with fat in the breast. High mammographic density is associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but the reasons for this link are not certain and are being studied. Conversely, patients with very low mammographic breast density were found to hold a poorer prognosis irrespective of age, BMI and menopausal status. =Red No. 3= Red No. 3 is a coloring agent used in some foods. In laboratory tests human breast cell DNA was found positive for damage when put into contact with Red No. 3, which means that it is genotoxic. = Viruses = Several kinds of viruses with oncogenic potential are suspected to play a role or cause breast cancer. Among the three most commonly studied are the human papilloma virus (HPV), mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A study published in 2011, reviewing 85 original molecular research investigations on the presence of one or more of these three viruses found that only seven of the studies convincingly demonstrated the presence of an oncogenic virus biomarker, while twenty-five of the studies were able to show the absence of the virus studied, and the remaining studies were excluded due to shortcomings. Thus, the data from these investigations do not justify a conclusion as to whether HPV, MMTV, or EBV play a causal role in human breast cancer development. Humans are not the only mammals susceptible to breast cancer. Some strains of mice, namely the house mouse (Mus domesticus) are prone to breast cancer which is caused by infection with the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV or \\"Bittner virus\\" for its discoverer John Joseph Bittner), by random insertional mutagenesis. It is the only animal breast cancer with a known etiology. These findings are taken to mean that a viral origin of human breast cancer is at least possible, though there is no definitive evidence to support the claim that MMTV causes human breast cancer. For example, there may be critical differences between cancer pathogenesis in mice and people. A human homologue of the mammary virus has been described in 1971 and linked to human breast cancer in several small epidemiologic studies. Factors with minimal or no impact There is no significant association between first-trimester abortion and breast cancer risk. There is no scientific evidence to prove that any kind of brassiere can cause cancer. The myth that breast cancer is linked with deodorant use has been widely circulated, and appears to originate from a spam email sent in 1999. There is however no evidence to support the existence of such a link. There is no persuasive connection between fertility medications and breast cancer. History In past centuries, the development of breast cancer was most commonly seen as divine punishment or a trial. From ancient Greek medicine until the end of the 17th century, the dominant medical explanation was an imbalance of the four humors. By the start of the 18th century, humoralism had generally been rejected. Many other theories were put forward, often related to sexual activity: In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini said that nuns developed breast cancer at a higher rate than married women because they did not engage in sexual intercourse, and the \\"unnatural\\" lack of sexual activity caused instability of the breasts; others countered that the cause was frequently too much sexual activity. Other theories from the 18th century included various sorts of problems with the movement of body fluids, such as lymphatic blockages, curdled breast milk or the transformation of pus left after an infection. In modern times, women are more likely to blame themselves, perhaps deciding that their diet, childbearing history, decision not to breastfeed, or level of exercise is the cause.

Treatment types can be classified into local therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) and systemic treatment (chemo-, endocrine, and targeted therapies). Local therapy is most efficacious in early stage breast cancer, while systemic therapy is generally justified in advanced and metastatic disease, or in diseases with specific phenotypes. Historically, breast cancer was treated with radical surgery alone. Advances in the understanding of the natural course of breast cancer as well as the development of systemic therapies allowed for the use of breast-conserving surgeries, however, the nomenclature of viewing non-surgical management from the viewpoint of the definitive surgery lends to two adjectives connected with treatment timelines: adjuvant (after surgery) and neoadjuvant (before surgery). The mainstay of breast cancer management is surgery for the local and regional tumor, followed (or preceded) by a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine (hormone) therapy, and targeted therapy. Research is ongoing for the use of immunotherapy in breast cancer management. Management of breast cancer is undertaken by a multidisciplinary team, including medical-, radiation-, and surgical- oncologists, and is guided by national and international guidelines. Factors such as treatment, oncologist, hospital and stage of your breast cancer decides the cost of breast cancer one must pay.  Staging  Staging breast cancer is the initial step to help physicians determine the most appropriate course of treatment. As of 2016, guidelines incorporated biologic factors, such as tumor grade, cellular proliferation rate, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expression, and gene expression profiling into the staging system. Cancer that has spread beyond the breast and the lymph nodes is classified as Stage 4, or metastatic cancer, and requires mostly systemic treatment. The TNM staging system of a cancer is a measurement of the physical extent of the tumor and its spread, where: * T stands for the main (primary) tumor (range of T0-T4) * N stands for spread to nearby lymph nodes (range of N0-N3) * M stands for metastasis (spread to distant parts of the body; either M0 or M1) If the stage is based on removal of the cancer with surgery and review by the pathologist, the letter p (for pathologic) or yp (pathologic after neoadjuvant therapy) may appear before the T and N letters. If the stage is based on clinical assessment using physical exam and imaging, the letter c (for clinical) may appear. The TNM information is then combined to give the cancer an overall stage. Stages are expressed in Roman numerals from stage I (the least advanced stage) to stage IV (the most advanced stage). Non-invasive cancer (carcinoma in situ) is listed as stage 0. TNM staging, in combination with histopathology, grade and genomic profiling, is used for the purpose of prognosis, and to determine whether additional treatment is warranted.  Classification  Breast cancer is classified into three major subtypes for the purpose of predicting response to treatment. These are determined by the presence or absence of receptors on the cells of the tumor. The three major subgroups are: * Luminal-type, which are tumors positive for hormone receptors (estrogen or progesterone receptor). This subtype suggests a response to endocrine therapy. * HER2-type, which are positive for over-expression of the HER2 receptor. ER and PR can be positive or negative. This subtype receives targeted therapy. * Basal-type, or Triple Negative (TN), which are negative for all three major receptor types Additional classification schema are used for prognosis and include histopathology, grade, stage, and genomic profiling. Surgery Excised breast tissue showing a stellate, pale area of cancer measuring 2 cm across. The tumor could be felt as a hard, mobile lump before the surgical excision. Surgery is the primary management for breast cancer. Depending on staging and biologic characteristics of the tumor, surgery can be a lumpectomy (removal of the lump only), a mastectomy, or a modified radical mastectomy. Lymph nodes are often included in the scope of breast tumor removal. Surgery can be performed before or after receiving systemic therapy. Lumpectomy techniques are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that for patients with a single tumor smaller than 4 cm, a lumpectomy with negative surgical margins may be as effective as a mastectomy. Prior to a lumpectomy, a needle-localization of the lesion with placement of a guidewire may be performed, sometimes by an interventional radiologist if the area being removed was detected by mammography or ultrasound, and sometimes by the surgeon if the lesion can be directly palpated. However, mastectomy may be the preferred treatment in certain instances: * Two or more tumors exist in different areas of the breast (a \\"multifocal\\" cancer) * The breast has previously received radiotherapy * The tumor is large relative to the size of the breast * The patient has had scleroderma or another disease of the connective tissue, which can complicate radiotherapy * The patient lives in an area where radiotherapy is inaccessible * The patient wishes to avoid systemic therapy * The patient is apprehensive about the risk of local recurrence after lumpectomy Specific types of mastectomy can also include: skin-sparing, nipple-sparing, subcutaneous, and prophylactic. Standard practice requires the surgeon to establish that the tissue removed in the operation has margins clear of cancer, indicating that the cancer has been completely excised. Additional surgery may be necessary if the removed tissue does not have clear margins, sometimes requiring removal of part of the pectoralis major muscle, which is the main muscle of the anterior chest wall. During the operation, the lymph nodes in the axilla are also considered for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing lymphedema of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects while achieving the same 10-year survival as its predecessor. The sentinel lymph node is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65‚Äì70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete lymph node dissection for what could turn out to be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel Lymph Node mapping over the past decade have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel Lymph Node from 80% using blue dye alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities. SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5 cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups. Recent trends continue to favor less radical axillar node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node. A meta-analysis has found that in people with operable primary breast cancer, compared to being treated with axillary lymph node dissection, being treated with lesser axillary surgery (such as axillary sampling or sentinel lymph node biopsy) does not lessen the chance of survival. Overall survival is slightly reduced by receiving radiotherapy alone when compared to axillary lymph node dissection. In the management of primary breast cancer, having no axillary lymph nodes removed is linked to increased risk of regrowth of cancer. Treatment with axillary lymph node dissection has been found to give an increased risk of lymphoedema, pain, reduced arm movement and numbness when compared to those treated with sentinel lymph node dissection or no axillary surgery. = Ovary removal = Prophylactic oophorectomy may be prudent in women who are at a high risk for recurrence or are seeking an alternative to endocrine therapy as it removes the primary source of estrogen production in pre-menopausal women. Women who are carriers of a BRCA mutation have an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancers and may choose to have their ovaries removed prophylactically as well. = Breast reconstruction = Breast reconstruction surgery is the rebuilding of the breast after breast cancer surgery, and is included in holistic approaches to cancer management to address identity and emotional aspects of the disease. Reconstruction can take place at the same time as cancer-removing surgery, or months to years later. Some women decide not to have reconstruction or opt for a prosthesis instead. =Investigational surgical management= Cryoablation is an experimental therapy available for women with small or early-stage breast cancer. The treatment freezes, than defrosts tumors using small needles so that only the harmful tissue is damaged and ultimately dies. This technique may provide an alternative to more invasive surgeries, potentially limiting side effects. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is an adjuvant treatment for most women who have undergone lumpectomy and for some women who have mastectomy surgery. In these cases the purpose of radiation is to reduce the chance that the cancer will recur locally (within the breast or axilla). Radiation therapy involves using high-energy X-rays or gamma rays that target a tumor or post surgery tumor site. This radiation is very effective in killing cancer cells that may remain after surgery or recur where the tumor was removed. Radiation therapy can be delivered by external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy), or by intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT). In the case of external beam radiotherapy, X-rays are delivered from outside the body by a machine called a Linear Accelerator or Linac. In contrast, brachytherapy involves the precise placement of radiation source(s) directly at the treatment site. IORT includes a one-time dose of radiation administered with breast surgery. Radiation therapy is important in the use of breast-conserving therapy because it reduces the risk of local recurrence. Radiation therapy eliminates the microscopic cancer cells that may remain near the area where the tumor was surgically removed. The dose of radiation must be strong enough to ensure the elimination of cancer cells. However, radiation affects normal cells and cancer cells alike, causing some damage to the normal tissue around where the tumor was. Healthy tissue can repair itself, while cancer cells do not repair themselves as well as normal cells. For this reason, radiation treatments are given over an extended period, enabling the healthy tissue to heal. Treatments using external beam radiotherapy are typically given over a period of five to seven weeks, performed five days a week. Recent large trials (UK START and Canadian) have confirmed that shorter treatment courses, typically over three to four weeks, result in equivalent cancer control and side effects as the more protracted treatment schedules. Each treatment takes about 15 minutes. A newer approach, called 'accelerated partial breast irradiation' (APBI), uses brachytherapy to deliver the radiation in a much shorter period of time. APBI delivers radiation to only the immediate region surrounding the original tumor and can typically be completed over the course of one week. =Indications for radiation= Radiation treatment is mainly effective in reducing the risk of local relapse in the affected breast. Therefore, it is recommended in most cases of breast conserving surgeries and less frequently after mastectomy. Indications for radiation treatment are constantly evolving. Patients treated in Europe have been more likely in the past to be recommended adjuvant radiation after breast cancer surgery as compared to patients in North America. Radiation therapy is usually recommended for all patients who had lumpectomy, quadrant-resection. Radiation therapy is usually not indicated in patients with advanced (stage IV disease) except for palliation of symptoms like bone pain or fungating lesions. In general recommendations would include radiation: *As part of breast conserving therapy. *After mastectomy for patients with higher risk of recurrence because of conditions such as a large primary tumor or substantial involvement of the lymph nodes. Other factors which may influence adding adjuvant radiation therapy: *Tumor close to or involving the margins on pathology specimen *Multiple areas of tumor (multicentric disease) *Microscopic invasion of lymphatic or vascular tissues *Microcopic invasion of the skin, nipple/areola, or underlying pectoralis major muscle *Patients with extension out of the substance of a LN *Inadequate numbers of axillary LN sampled =Types of radiotherapy= The SAVI applicator is a multiple catheter breast brachytherapy device. Radiotherapy can be delivered in many ways but is most commonly produced by a linear accelerator. This usually involves treating the whole breast in the case of breast lumpectomy or the whole chest wall in the case of mastectomy. Lumpectomy patients with early-stage breast cancer may be eligible for a newer, shorter form of treatment called \\"breast brachytherapy\\". This approach allows physicians to treat only part of the breast in order to spare healthy tissue from unnecessary radiation. Improvements in computers and treatment delivery technology have led to more complex radiotherapy treatment options. One such new technology is using IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy), which can change the shape and intensity of the radiation beam making \\"beamlets\\" at different points across and inside the breast. This allows for better dose distribution within the breast while minimizing dose to healthy organs such as the lung or heart. However, there is yet to be a demonstrated difference in treatment outcomes (both tumor recurrence and level of side effects) for IMRT in breast cancer when compared to conventional radiotherapy treatment. In addition, conventional radiotherapy can also deliver similar dose distributions utilizing modern computer dosimetry planning and equipment. External beam radiation therapy treatments for breast cancer are typically given every day, five days a week, for five to 10 weeks. Within the past decade, a new approach called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has gained popularity. APBI is used to deliver radiation as part of breast conservation therapy. It treats only the area where the tumor was surgically removed, plus adjacent tissue. APBI reduces the length of treatment to just five days, compared to the typical six or seven weeks for whole breast irradiation. APBI treatments can be given as brachytherapy or external beam with a linear accelerator. These treatments are usually limited to women with well-defined tumors that have not spread. A meta-analysis of randomised trials of partial breast irradiation (PBI) vs. whole breast irradiation (WBI) as part of breast conserving therapy demonstrated a reduction in non-breast-cancer and overall mortality. Full text and Audio Slides In breast brachytherapy, the radiation source is placed inside the breast, treating the cavity from the inside out. There are several different devices that deliver breast brachytherapy. Some use a single catheter and balloon to deliver the radiation. Other devices utilize multiple catheters to deliver radiation. A study is currently underway by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to determine whether limiting radiation therapy to only the tumor site following lumpectomy is as effective as radiating the whole breast. New technology has also allowed more precise delivery of radiotherapy in a portable fashion -- for example in the operating theatre. Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) is a method of delivering therapeutic radiation from within the breast using a portable X-ray generator called Intrabeam. The TARGIT-A trial was an international randomised controlled non-inferiority phase III clinical trial led from University College London. 28 centres in 9 countries accrued 2,232 patients to test whether TARGIT can replace the whole course of radiotherapy in selected patients. The TARGIT-A trial results found that the difference between the two treatments was 0.25% (95% CI -1.0 to 1.5) i.e., at most 1.5% worse or at best 1.0% better with single dose TARGIT than with standard course of several weeks of external beam radiotherapy. In the TARGIT-B trial, as the TARGIT technique is precisely aimed and given immediately after surgery, in theory it could be able provide a better boost dose to the tumor bed as suggested in phase II studies. Systemic therapy Nolvadex (tamoxifen) 20 mg tablets (UK)Systemic therapy uses medications to treat cancer cells throughout the body. Any combination of systemic treatments may be used to treat breast cancer. Standard of care systemic treatments include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy. = Chemotherapy = Chemotherapy (drug treatment for cancer) may be used before surgery, after surgery, or instead of surgery for those cases in which surgery is considered unsuitable. Chemotherapy is justified for cancers whose prognosis after surgery is poor without additional intervention. = Hormonal therapy = Patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors are candidates for receiving endocrine therapy to reduce chance of relapse or of a new primary breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is usually administered after surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been given, but can also occur in the neoadjuvant or non-surgical setting. Hormonal treatments include: * Tamoxifen is typically given to premenopausal women to inhibit activity of estrogen receptors. * Aromatase inhibitors are typically given to postmenopausal women to lower the amount of bioavailable estrogen in their systems. * GnRH analogues for are beneficial in women who remain premenopausal and are at sufficient risk for recurrence to warrant adjuvant chemotherapy. * Estrogen cycling was reported at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About a third of the 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen- lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). * Anabolic steroids such as testosterone, fluoxymesterone, drostanolone propionate, epitiostanol, and mepitiostane have historically been used to treat breast cancer because of their antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but are now rarely if ever used due to their virilizing side effects. = Targeted therapy = In patients whose cancer expresses an over-abundance of the HER2 protein, a monoclonal antibody known as trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used to block the activity of the HER2 protein in breast cancer cells, slowing their growth. In the advanced cancer setting, trastuzumab use in combination with chemotherapy can both delay cancer growth as well as improve the recipient's survival. Pertuzumab may work synergistically with trastuzumab on the expanded EGFR family of receptors, although it is currently only standard of care for metastatic disease. Neratinib has been approved by the FDA for extended adjuvant treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. PARP inhibitors are used in the metastatic setting, and are being investigated for use in the non- metastatic setting through clinical trials. Treatment response assessment =Medical imaging= Managing side effects Drugs and radiotherapy given for cancer can cause unpleasant side effects such as nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, dermatitis, and menopausal symptoms. Around a third of patients with cancer use complementary therapies, including homeopathic medicines, to try to reduce these side effects. =Insomnia= It was believed that one would find a bi-directional relationship between insomnia and pain, but instead it was found that trouble sleeping was more likely a cause, rather than a consequence, of pain in patients with cancer. An early intervention to manage sleep would overall relieve patient with side effects. Approximately 40 percent of menopausal women experience sleep disruption, often in the form of difficulty with sleep initiation and frequent nighttime awakenings. There is a study, first to show sustained benefits in sleep quality from gabapentin, which Rochester researchers already have demonstrated alleviates hot flashes. =Hot flushes= Lifestyle adjustments are usually suggested first to manage hot flushes (or flashes) due to endocrine therapy.See for example a review by Kligman and Younus This can include avoiding triggers such as alcohol, caffeine and smoking. If hot flashes continue, and depending on their frequency and severity, several drugs can be effective in some patients, in particular SNRIs such as venlafaxine, also oxybutinin and others. Complementary medicines that contain phytoestrogens are not recommended for breast cancer patients as they may stimulate oestrogen receptor-positive tumours.For example National Prescribing Service NPS MedicineWise  Published in Health News and Evidence 14 July 2014  retrieved 25 August 2014 =Lymphedema= Some patients develop lymphedema, as a result of axillary node dissection or of radiation treatment to the lymph nodes. Although traditional recommendations limited exercise, a new study shows that participating in a safe, structured weight-lifting routine can help women with lymphedema take control of their symptoms and reap the many rewards that resistance training has on their overall health as they begin life as a cancer survivor. It recommends that women start with a slowly progressive program, supervised by a certified fitness professional, in order to learn how to do these types of exercises properly. Women with lymphedema should also wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise sessions. = Upper-limb dysfunction = Upper-limb dysfunction is a common side effect of breast cancer treatment. Shoulder range of motion can be impaired after surgery. Exercise can meaningfully improve should range of motion in women with breast cancer. An exercise programme can be started early after surgery, if it does not negatively affect wound drainage. =Side effects of radiation therapy= External beam radiation therapy is a non-invasive treatment with some short term and some longer-term side effects. Patients undergoing some weeks of treatment usually experience fatigue caused by the healthy tissue repairing itself and aside from this there can be no side effects at all. However many breast cancer patients develop a suntan-like change in skin color in the exact area being treated. As with a suntan, this darkening of the skin usually returns to normal in the one to two months after treatment. In some cases permanent changes in color and texture of the skin is experienced. Other side effects sometimes experienced with radiation can include: *muscle stiffness *mild swelling *tenderness in the area *lymphedema After surgery, radiation and other treatments have been completed, many patients notice the affected breast seems smaller or seems to have shrunk. This is basically due to the removal of tissue during the lumpectomy operation. The use of adjuvant radiation has significant potential effects if the patient has to later undergo breast reconstruction surgery. Fibrosis of chest wall skin from radiation negatively affects skin elasticity and makes tissue expansion techniques difficult. Traditionally most patients are advised to defer immediate breast reconstruction when adjuvant radiation is planned and are most often recommended surgery involving autologous tissue reconstruction rather than breast implants. Studies suggest APBI may reduce the side effects associated with radiation therapy, because it treats only the tumor cavity and the surrounding tissue. In particular, a device that uses multiple catheters and allows modulation of the radiation dose delivered by each of these catheters has been shown to reduce harm to nearby, healthy tissue.

It lifts water 1,926 feet (600 m) to cross the Tehachapi Mountains where it splits into the west and east branches of the California Aqueduct serving Southern California. It is the most powerful water lifting system in the world, not considering pumped-storage hydroelectricity stations. There are 14 4-stage 80,000-horsepower centrifugal pumps that push the water up to the top of the mountain. Each motor-pump unit stands 65-feet high and weighs 420 tons. The pumps themselves extend downward six floors. Each unit discharges water into a manifold that connects to the main discharge lines. The two main discharge lines stairstep up the mountain in an 8400-foot-long tunnel. They are 12.5 feet in diameter for the first half and 14 feet in diameter for the last half. They each contain 8.5 million gallons of water at all times. At full capacity, the pumps can fling nearly 2 million gallons per minute up over the Tehachapis. A 68-foot-high, 50-foot-diameter surge tank is located at the top of mountain. This prevents tunnel damage when the valves to the pumps are suddenly open or closed. Near the top of the lift there are valves which can close the discharge lines to prevent backflow into the pumping plant below in event of a rupture. The station consumes up to 787 MW of electricity, delivered through a dedicated 230kV transmission line from the nearby Southern California Edison Pastoria substation.http://www3.sce.com/sscc/law/dis/dbattach7.nsf/0/A3FCBFC1CFED06DA882575920062466D/$FILE/2005-03-07+Offer+Of+Settlement+ER05-170.pdf#page=20 Characteristics * Number of units: 14 (two galleries of 7) * Normal static head: 1,970 ftFerretti, Alexandra. \\"Success Story of the Year 2009 Finalists: Hitachi\\" Pumps&Systems;, July 2009.

The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. A clinical or self breast exam involves feeling the breast for lumps or other abnormalities. Medical evidence, however, does not support its use in women with a typical risk for breast cancer. The use of mammography in universal screening for breast cancer is controversial as it may not reduce all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures. Many national organizations recommend it for most older women. In the United States screening mammography women at normal risk for breast cancer, is only recommended every two years in women between the ages of 50 and 74. Several tools are available to help target breast cancer screening to older women with longer life expectancies.Schonberg M. Breast cancer screening: at what age to stop? Consultant. 2010;50(May):196-205. Similar imaging studies can be performed with magnetic resonance imaging but evidence is lacking. Earlier, more aggressive, and more frequent screening is recommended for women at particularly high risk of developing breast cancer, such as those with a confirmed BRCA mutation, those who have previously had breast cancer, and those with a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer. Abnormal findings on screening are further investigated by surgically removing a piece of the suspicious lumps (biopsy) to examine them under the microscope. Ultrasound may be used to guide the biopsy needle during the procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging is used to guide treatment, but is not an established screening method for healthy women. Breast exam A pictorial example of breast self-examination in six steps. Steps 1-3 involve visual inspection of the breasts with the arms in different positions. Step 4 is palpation of the breast. Step 5 is palpation of the nipple. Step 6 is palpation of the breast while lying down. Breast examination (either clinical breast exams (CBE) by a health care provider or by self exams) were once widely recommended. They however are not supported by evidence and may, like mammography and other screening methods that produce false positive results, contribute to harm. The use of screening in women without symptoms and at low risk is thus controversial. A 2003 Cochrane review found screening by breast self-examination is not associated with lower death rates among women who report performing breast self-examination and does, like other breast cancer screening methods, increase harms, in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed. They conclude \\"at present, breast self-examination cannot be recommended\\". There was no high quality evidence looking at clinical breast examination. Mammography Mammography is a common screening method, since it is relatively fast and widely available in developed countries. Mammography is a type of radiography used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms or has been called back for follow-up views (called diagnostic mammography), and for medical screening of apparently healthy women (called screening mammography). Mammography is not very useful in finding breast tumors in dense breast tissue characteristic of women under 40 years. In women over 50 without dense breasts, breast cancers detected by screening mammography are usually smaller and less aggressive than those detected by patients or doctors as a breast lump. This is because the most aggressive breast cancers are found in dense breast tissue, which mammograms perform poorly on. The presumption was that by detecting cancer in an earlier stage, women will be more likely to be cured by treatment. This assertion, however, has been challenged by recent reviews which have found the significance of these net benefits to be lacking for women at average risk of dying from breast cancer. =Mechanism= Normal (left) versus cancerous (right) mammography image. Screening mammography is usually recommended to women who are most likely to develop breast cancer. In general, this means women who have risk factors such as having a personal or family history of breast cancer or being older women, but not being frail elderly women, who are unlikely to benefit from treatment. Women who agree to be screened have their breasts X-rayed on a specialized X-ray machine. This exposes the woman's breasts to a small amount of ionizing radiation, which has a very small, but non-zero, chance of causing cancer. The X-ray image, called a radiograph, is sent to a physician who specializes in interpreting these images, called a radiologist. The image may be on plain photographic film or digital mammography on a computer screen; despite the much higher cost of the digital systems, the two methods are generally considered equally effective. The equipment may use a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. There is considerable variation in interpreting the images; the same image may be declared normal by one radiologist and suspicious by another. It can be helpful to compare the images to any previously taken images, as changes over time may be significant. If suspicious signs are identified in the image, then the woman is usually recalled for a second mammogram, sometimes after waiting six months to see whether the spot is growing, or a biopsy of the breast. Most of these will prove to be false positives, resulting in sometimes debilitating anxiety over nothing. Most women recalled will undergo additional imaging only, without any further intervention. Recall rates are higher in the U.S. than in the UK. =Effectiveness= On balance, screening mammography in older women increases medical treatment and saves a small number of lives. Usually, it has no effect on the outcome of any breast cancer that it detects. Screening targeted towards women with above-average risk produces more benefit than screening of women at average or low risk for breast cancer. A 2013 Cochrane review estimated that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old results in a relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were just as likely to die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect might be less in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is ‚Äúno longer effective‚Äù at preventing deaths and ‚Äúit therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend‚Äù for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. The review also concluded that \\"half or more\\" of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment. They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because these changes would not have progressed into invasive cancer. The accidental harm from screening mammography has been underestimated. Women who have mammograms end up with increased surgeries, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other potentially procedures resulting from the over-detection of harmless lumps. Many women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. Half of suspicious findings will not become dangerous or will disappear over time. Consequently, the value of routine mammography in women at low or average risk is controversial. With unnecessary treatment of ten women for every one woman whose life was prolonged, the authors concluded that routine mammography may do more harm than good. If 1,000 women in their 50s are screened every year for ten years, the following outcomes are considered typical in the developed world: * One woman's life will be extended due to earlier detection of breast cancer. * 2 to 10 women will be overdiagnosed and needlessly treated for cancer that would have stopped growing on its own or otherwise caused no harm during the woman's lifetime. * 5 to 15 women will be treated for breast cancer, with the same outcome as if cancer had been detected after symptoms appeared. * 500 will be incorrectly told they might have breast cancer (false positive). * 125 to 250 will undergo breast biopsy. The outcomes are worse for women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, as they are far less likely to have a life-threatening breast cancer, and more likely to have dense breasts that make interpreting the mammogram more difficult. Among women in their 60s, who have a somewhat higher rate of breast cancer, the proportion of positive outcomes to harms are better: * For women in their 40s: About 2,000 women would need to be screened every year for 10 years to prevent one death from breast cancer. 1,000 of these women would experience false positives, and 250 healthy women would undergo unnecessary biopsies. * For women in their 50s: About 1,350 women would need to be screened for every year for 10 years to prevent one death from breast cancer. Half of these women would experience false positives, and one-quarter would undergo unnecessary biopsies. * For women in their 60s: About 375 women would need to be screened for every year for 10 years to prevent one death from breast cancer. Half of these women would experience false positives, and one-quarter would undergo unnecessary biopsies. Mammography is not generally considered as an effective screening technique for women at average or low risk of developing cancer who are less than 50 years old. For normal-risk women 40 to 49 years of age, the risks of mammography outweigh the benefits, and the US Preventive Services Task Force says that the evidence in favor of routine screening of women under the age of 50 is \\"weak\\". Part of the difficulty in interpreting mammograms in younger women stems from breast density. Radiographically, a dense breast has a preponderance of glandular tissue, and younger age or estrogen hormone replacement therapy contribute to mammographic breast density. After menopause, the breast glandular tissue gradually is replaced by fatty tissue, making mammographic interpretation much more accurate. =Recommendations= Recommendations to attend to mammography screening vary across countries and organizations, with the most common difference being the age at which screening should begin, and how frequently or if it should be performed, among women at typical risk for developing breast cancer. In November 2016 the European Commission published recommendations suggesting asymptomatic women with average risk to attend organised screening between 45 and 74 years old. In England, all women were invited for screening once every three years beginning at age 50,\\"Why are women under 50 not routinely invited for breast screening?\\", Public Health England, accessed 19 May 2014. There is a trial in progress to assess the risks and benefits of offering screening to women aged 47 to 49 (Public Health England 2017). Public Health England, accessed 19 May 2014 Some other organizations recommend mammograms begin as early as age 40 in normal-risk women, and take place more frequently, up to once each year. Women at higher risk may benefit from earlier or more frequent screening. Women with one or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with premenopausal breast cancer often begin screening at an earlier age, perhaps at an age 10 years younger than the age when the relative was diagnosed with breast cancer. As of 2009 the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women over the age of 50 receive mammography once every two years. The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) states that the best quality evidence neither demonstrates a reduction in either cancer specific, nor a reduction in all-cause mortality from screening mammography. When less rigorous trials are added to the analysis there is a reduction in breast cancer specific mortality of 0.05% (a relative decrease of 15%). Screening results in a 30% increase in rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment, resulting in the view that it is not clear whether mammography screening does more good or harm. On their Web site, Cochrane currently concludes that, due to recent improvements in breast cancer treatment, and the risks of false positives from breast cancer screening leading to unnecessary treatment, \\"it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend for breast cancer screening\\" at any age. =Breast density= Two mammograms of normal dense breasts. Breasts are made up of breast tissue, connective tissue, and adipose (fat) tissue. The amount of each of the three types of tissue varies from woman to woman. Breast density is a measurement of relative amounts of these three tissues in a woman's breasts, as determined by their appearance on an X-ray image. Breast and connective tissues are radiographically denser (they produce a brighter white on an X-ray) than adipose tissue on a mammogram, so a woman with more breast tissue and/or more connective tissue is said to have greater breast density. Breast density is assessed by mammography and expressed as a percentage of the mammogram occupied by radiologically dense tissue (percent mammographic density or PMD). About half of middle-aged women have dense breasts, and breasts generally become less dense as they age. Higher breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Further, breast cancers are difficult to detect through mammograms in women with high breast density because most cancers and dense breast tissues have a similar appearance on a mammogram. As a result, higher breast density is associated with a higher rate of false negatives (missed cancers). Because of the importance of breast density as a risk indicator and as a measure of diagnostic accuracy, automated methods have been developed to facilitate assessment and reporting. =Health programs= United States In 2005, about 68% of all U.S. women age 40‚Äì64 had a mammogram in the past two years (75% of women with private health insurance, 56% of women with Medicaid insurance, 38% of currently uninsured women, and 33% of women uninsured for more than 12 months). All U.S. states except Utah require private health insurance plans and Medicaid to pay for breast cancer screening. As of 1998, Medicare (available to those aged 65 or older or who have been on Social Security Disability Insurance for over 2 years) pays for annual screening mammography in women aged 40 or older. Canada Three out of twelve (3/12) breast cancer screening programs in Canada offer clinical breast examinations. All twelve offer screening mammography every two years for women aged 50‚Äì69, while nine out of twelve (9/12) offer screening mammography for women aged 40‚Äì49. In 2003, about 61% of women aged 50‚Äì69 in Canada reported having had a mammogram within the past two years. United Kingdom The UK's NHS Breast Screening Programme, the first of its kind in the world, began in 1988 and achieved national coverage in the mid-1990s. It provides free breast cancer screening mammography every three years for all women in the UK aged from 50 and up to their 71st birthday. The NHS Breast Screening Programme is supporting a research study trial to assess the risks (i.e. the chances of being diagnosed and treated for a non-life-threatening cancer) and benefits(i.e. the chances of saving life) in women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 (Public Health England 2017). As of 2006, about 76% of women aged 53‚Äì64 resident in England had been screened at least once in the previous three years. However a 2016 UK-based study has also highlighted that the uptake of breast cancer screening among women living with severe mental illness (SMI) is lower than patients of the same age in the same population, without SMI. After information technology problems affected the recall system in England an internal inquiry by Public Health England and an independent inquiry were established and the National Audit Office started an investigation. Australia The Australian national breast screening program, BreastScreen Australia, was commenced in the early 1990s and invites women aged 50‚Äì74 to screening every 2 years. No routine clinical examination is performed, and the cost of screening is free to the point of diagnosis. Singapore The Singapore national breast screening program, BreastScreen Singapore, is the only publicly funded national breast screening program in Asia and enrolls women aged 50‚Äì64 for screening every two years. Like the Australian system, no clinical examination is performed routinely. Unlike most national screening systems, however, clients have to pay half of the cost of the screening mammogram; this is in line with the Singapore health system's core principle of co-payment for all health services. =Criticisms= Most women significantly overestimate both their own risk of dying from breast cancer and the effect screening mammography could have on it. Some researchers worry that if women correctly understood that screening programs offer a small, but statistically significant benefit, more women would refuse to participate. The contribution of mammography to the early diagnosis of cancer is controversial, and for those found with benign lesions, mammography can create a high psychological and financial cost. Most women participating in mammography screening programs accept the risk of false positive recall, and the majority do not find it very distressing. Many patients find the recall very frightening, and are intensely relieved to discover that it was a false positive, as about 90% of women do.Welch, 2011. pp. 177‚Äì178. A major effect of routine breast screening is to greatly increase the rate of early breast cancer detection, in particular for non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), sometimes called \\"pre-breast cancer\\", which almost never forms a lump and which generally cannot be detected except through mammography. While this ability to detect such very early breast malignancies is at the heart of claims that screening mammography can improve survival from breast cancer, it is also controversial. This is because a very large proportion of such cases will not progress to kill the patient, and thus mammography cannot be genuinely claimed to have saved any lives in such cases; in fact, it would lead to increased sickness and unnecessary surgery for such patients. Consequently, finding and treating many cases of DCIS represents overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Treatment is given to all women with DCIS because it is currently impossible to predict which patients with DCIS will have an indolent, non-fatal course, and which few will inevitably progress to invasive cancer and premature death if left untreated. Consequently, all patients with DCIS are treated in much the same way, with at least wide local excision, and sometimes mastectomy if the DCIS is very extensive. The cure rate for DCIS if treated appropriately is extremely high, partly because the majority of DCIS cases were harmless in the first place. The phenomenon of finding pre-invasive malignancy or nonmalignant benign disease is commonplace in all forms of cancer screening, including pap smears for cervical cancer, fecal occult blood testing for colon cancer, and prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer. All of these tests have the potential to detect asymptomatic cancers, and all of them have a high rate of false positives and lead to invasive procedures that are unlikely to benefit the patient. Risk- based screening Risk-based screening uses risk assessment of a woman‚Äôs five- year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer to issue personalized screening recommendations of when to start, stop, and how often to screen. In general, women with low risk are recommended to screen less frequently, while screening is intensified in those at high risk. The hypothesis is that focusing screening on women most likely to develop invasive breast cancer will reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The first clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of risk-based screening compared to annual screening, the Wisdom Study, is under way in California (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02620852) Molecular breast imaging Molecular breast imaging is a nuclear medicine technique that is currently under study. It shows promising results for imaging people with dense breast tissue and may have accuracies comparable to MRI. It may be better than mammography in some people with dense breast tissue, detecting two to three times more cancers in this population. It however carries a greater risk of radiation damage making it inappropriate for general breast cancer screening. It is possible to reduce the dose of radiation used. An earlier alternative technique suited to dense breast tissue, scintimammography is now not recommended by the American Cancer Society, which states, \\"This test cannot show whether an abnormal area is cancer as accurately as a mammogram, and it‚Äôs not used as a screening test. Some radiologists believe this test may be helpful in looking at suspicious areas found by mammogram. But the exact role of scintimammography is still unclear.\\" Ultrasonography Medical ultrasonography is a diagnostic aid to mammography. Adding ultrasonography testing for women with dense breast tissue increases the detection of breast cancer, but also increases false positives. Review in: J Fam Pract. 2008 Aug;57(8):508 Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to detect cancers not visible on mammograms. The chief strength of breast MRI is its very high negative predictive value. A negative MRI can rule out the presence of cancer to a high degree of certainty, making it an excellent tool for screening in patients at high genetic risk or radiographically dense breasts, and for pre-treatment staging where the extent of disease is difficult to determine on mammography and ultrasound. MRI can diagnose benign proliferative change, fibroadenomas, and other common benign findings at a glance, often eliminating the need for costly and unnecessary biopsies or surgical procedures. The spatial and temporal resolution of breast MRI has increased markedly in recent years, making it possible to detect or rule out the presence of small in situ cancers, including ductal carcinoma in situ. Despite the aids provided from MRIs, there are some disadvantages. For example, although it is 27‚Äì36% more sensitive, it has been claimed to be less specific than mammography. As a result, MRI studies may have up to 30% more false positives, which may have undesirable financial and psychological costs on the patient. Also, MRI procedures are expensive and include an intravenous injection of a gadolinium contrast, which has been implicated in a rare reaction called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NFS). Although NSF is uncommon, other patients with a history of renal failure/disease would not be able to undergo an MRI scan. Breast MRI is not recommended for screening all breast cancer patients, yet limited to patients with high risk of developing breast cancer that may have high familial risk or mutations in BCRA1/2 genes. Breast MRI is not a perfect tool despite its increased sensitivity for detecting breast cancer masses when compared to mammography. This due to the ability of MRIs to miss some cancers that would have been detected with conventional mammography, as a result, MRI screening for breast cancer is most affective as a combination with other tests and for certain breast cancer patients. In contrast, the use of MRIs are often limiting to patients with any body metal integration such as patients with tattoos, pacemakers, tissue expanders, and so on. Proposed indications for using MRI for screening include: *Strong family history of breast cancer *Patients with BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 oncogene mutations *Evaluation of women with breast implants *History of previous lumpectomy or breast biopsy surgeries *Axillary metastasis with an unknown primary tumor *Very dense or scarred breast tissue In addition, breast MRI may be helpful for screening in women who have had breast augmentation procedures involving intramammary injections of various foreign substances that may mask the appearances of breast cancer on mammography and/or ultrasound. These substances include silicone oil and polyacrylamide gel. BRCA testing Genetic testing does not detect cancers, but may reveal a propensity to develop cancer. Women who are known to have a higher risk of developing breast cancer usually undertake more aggressive screening programs. A clinical practice guideline by the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine referral for genetic counseling or routine testing for BRCA mutations, on fair evidence that the harms outweigh the benefits. It also encourages a referral for counseling and testing in women who have a family history that indicates they have an increased risk of a BRCA mutation, on fair evidence of benefit. About 2% of American women have family histories that indicate an increased risk of having a medically significant BRCA mutation. Immuno-tests TBIA (Total Biochemistry Infra-red Analysis) is a new technology for breast cancer screening based on the immune system's respond to the tumor. It is a blood test that can detect cancer at early stages as well as distinguish benign from malignant tumors. the test is based on the fact that cells from the immune system that pass through a tumor change and can be found everywhere in the body and identified in early stages of cancer. The blood sample is taken and is checked using an infra-red spectrometer so that cells that interacted with cancer cells will be identified. Other The nipple aspirate test is not indicated for breast cancer screening. Optical imaging, also known as diaphanography (DPG), multi-scan transillumination, and light scanning, is the use of transillumination to distinguish tissue variations. It is in the early stage of study.

It was formed from the names of four students ‚Äî Mario Martins de Almeida, Euclides Miragaia, Dr√°usio Marcondes de Sousa and Antonio Camargo de Andrade ‚Äî who were killed by federal troops in a clash on May 23, 1932, at the Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica, in S√£o Paulo. This event triggered the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution.  History  In 1932, Brazil experienced a period in which the Vargas regime governed without a constitution that formally delineated the powers of the President or that made clear the separation of powers between the National Congress, the Legislature, and municipal councils. In reaction, the Paulistas began to move against the Vargas dictatorship, and students prepared a series of demonstrations, which broke out across the capital in a climate of growing revolt on 23 May of that year. The Revolutionary League, an organization favorable to the regime of Get√∫lio Vargas was located near the Republic Square. A group of students tried to invade the pro-government League, which resisted with force resulting in the death of four students, Martins, Miragaia, Camargo and Dr√°usio died - three of them during the confrontation, and the fourth shortly afterward. A fifth student, Orlando Alvarenga de Oliveira, was injured during the fight did not have his name immediately associated with the movement since he died three months later on 12 August, 1932. Following the episode of Republic Square, an intense campaign of voluntary enlistment throughout the state commenced on July 9, 1932, culminating in the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution. The initials of Martins, Miragaia, Camargo and Dr√°usio, M.M.D.C, were used to represent a secret civil organisation which, among other activities, offered military training to the Paulista guerrillas.  MMDCA  Some historians use the initialism MMDCA in honor of Orlando de Oliveira Alvarenga, who died of his wounds three months after the clash in August 1932. To honor him, the state government created the \\"Colar Cruz de Alvarenga e dos Her√≥is An√¥nimos\\" (\\"Necklace Cross of Alvarenga and Anonymous Heroes\\").

Crosbie, who often spoke of \\"killing somebody\\" to be reunited with his older brothers in prison, was nineteen at the time of the murders. He was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2003 and will be eligible for parole in 2031, aged 49. Early life Crosbie was born the youngest of five children in a family home that was often the scene of domestic violence. His parents separated when he was five years old and Crosbie was at times placed into foster care. He would often spend times with his older brothers killing dogs, cats and other animals and watching violent films. Crosbie's older brother resides as an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital after being found not guilty of murder due to mental impairment. Another brother is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence for attempted murder. Crosbie spoke regularly of killing somebody to be \\"reunited\\" with his brothers. During August 2000, police attended at Crosbie's home when neighbours alerted them of Crosbie smashing his belongings. Police arrested Crosbie and escorted him to the Latrobe Regional Hospital where he was treated by a psychiatrist after making alarming statements. A police officer who escorted Crosbie to the hospital made the following notes, :\\"Listening to Crosbie he was a very angry and disturbed person. He feels like the world is against him. He has a deep hatred for all those that have caused him grief in the past. I believe that he could cause serious injury to someone in the future. He appeared fixated with the idea of killing someone in an effort to be reunited with his two brothers. All members (of the police force) should be made aware of his thoughts and treat Crosbie with extreme caution.\\" During 2000, Crosbie met Melissa Maahs and commenced a relationship. After a short time they moved in together at Crosbie's father's premises in Morwell. From 5 November 2000 they shared a Ministry of Housing home in Buna Street, Morwell, until 8 April 2001 when the couple moved in to share with Melissa's mother Kaye in Dayble Street. Double murder On 18 August 2001, at approximately 3am, Crosbie sat awake watching a movie. His girlfriend Melissa lay sleeping beside him in the couple's bed. Without warning, Crosbie removed a skinning knife from a scabbard and proceeded to stab his girlfriend three times to the head while she lay sleeping. Melissa woke and began to scream and fight off her attacker. Crosbie then attacked Melissa's mother Kaye in the hallway of their home as she came to her daughter's assistance. Realizing Kaye was not dead, he attacked her further using two porcelain ornaments, smashing them both; a frying pan, buckling it; and an iron. Crosbie alternated between attacking Melissa and Kaye many times over, and would have sexual intercourse with Melissa's dead body, using pornographic magazines on her back while defiling her. After murdering the two women, Crosbie then disturbed the contents of the house to make it appear as if a burglary had occurred. Crosbie escaped the murder scene in a taxi, travelling to Morwell railway station and purchasing a ticket to Wangaratta. A male relative later found the bodies of the two women when he visited their home after not hearing from them for two days. Crosbie disposed of the murder weapon in a creek in Wangaratta. Guilty plea On 20 August 2001, police attended to Crosbie's father's home in relation to the murders. Crosbie made full admissions to his crimes. He could not offer police any reasonable explanation for the murders, saying of his girlfriend Melissa's murder, :\\"I don't know. I don't. I just did and I've been thinking about it ever since fucking Saturday morning. Wouldn't have a clue ... It's got me thinking all this time, about what normal reason she's the only girl that's ever loved me. Why the fuck would I wanna hurt her? \\" Professor Paul Mullen, Professor of Forensic Psychiatry at Monash University spoke of Crosbie's sexual sadism in a pre-sentencing report, :\\"Crosbie states that his relationship with Melissa Maahs was the closest and most personally rewarding relationship of his life. Similarly he describes his prior relationship with the mother, Mrs Kaye Maahs as one of affection and closeness. The dreadful killings appear to have emerged not out of anger, resentment or jealousy, but in the context of a fear of increasing closeness and a fear that he would inevitably lose these relationships which he valued. The killings themselves would appear to have elements not just of extreme brutality but of active sadism involving sexual excitement linked to the murderous acts.\\" Crosbie pleaded guilty to both murders and was sentenced on 11 March 2003 in the Supreme Court of Victoria to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years. Crosbie later appeared in court seeking to suppress the fact that he had sex with the body of Melissa Maahs after he murdered her. His request was denied; he resides in protective custody while imprisoned due to threats on his life from fellow prisoners.Sex Sadist Pleads Guilty to Murder Of Two Women , Accessed 13 October 2007 He will be eligible for parole on 20 August 2031, aged 49.

Many were arrested and rewards were offered for the capture of their leader Dr. Charles Duncombe, plus David Anderson, Joshua Doan and others. Some of the suspects from the Sparta area - George Lawton, Dr. John T. Wilson, Joshua and Joel Doan, escaped to the United States. Joshua Doan was captured after engaging in a foolhardy attack against the village of Windsor in December 1838. Along with other exiles captured in the raid, Doan was tried, found guilty, and hanged.

Up until his death, Moore served as clergy reserve inspector, helping to implement one of the post-rebellion recommendations of Lord Durham, that land set aside for the Church of England be sold off, as no other denomination had been granted land. The abuse, by the Family Compact, of clergy reserves and the income from them had been one of the sorest points for inciting the rebellions.

In May 1968 they mounted the barricades, but in the film they have both reached fifty. Eddie ended up marrying and became the mother of a beautiful girl. She lives off her ex-husband under the same roof. His public relations firm has only one client, Chantal Goya. Patsy remained single and independent, spending her life as muse to various men. Patsy and Eddie are shown drinking champagne at any time of day or night, shrouded in the smoke of tobacco and marijuana. Eddie leads Safrane, her daughter, into the chaos of her values. She is still a virgin at 17 and preparing for the Polytechnic entrance exam. Eddie's ex-husband can no longer put up with her permanent pranks, alcoholism, grotesque and pathological irresponsibility.

For the screenplay, Aghion translated scenes from the original series, and tied them together into a coherent screenplay. The role of Patsy was originally offered to Amanda Lear, who declined by saying that she had \\"already lived it\\". Reception The film performed poorly at the French box office and was panned by most French critics,Absolument fabuleux : Critiques Presse who argued that it failed to translate the typically British humour of the original television series.

In contention, any computer in the network can transmit data at any time (first come-first served). This system breaks down when two computers attempt to transmit at the same time. This is known as a collision. To avoid collisions, a carrier sensing mechanism is used. Here each computer listens to the network before attempting to transmit. If the network is busy, it waits until network quiets down. In carrier detection, computers continue to listen to the network as they transmit. If computer detects another signal that interferes with the signal it is sending, it stops transmitting. Both computers then wait for random amount of time and attempt to transmit. Contention methods are most popular media access control method on LANs. Collision detection and recovery One method to handle collisions in a contention based system is to optimize collision detection and subsequent recovery. *A collision can be detected by listening to the shared medium immediately after transmitting and identifying collision characteristics ; or by capturing data from the medium and performing error detection. *For recovery, some systems simply cause senders to re-transmit collided data (perhaps with backing-off algorithms which reduce the sender's re-transmit rate when collisions keep occurring) or use Error Correction techniques such as FEC. Collision avoidance An alternative method to handle collisions in a contention based system is to attempt to avoid them. Some systems may utilize a strict scheduling guideline to identify who may use which resources when. Other systems may have the senders listen to the channel immediately prior to transmitting and determine suitable times to transmit. Common examples Collisions are a condition that arises when two or more data stations attempt to transmit at the same time over a shared channel, or when two data stations attempt to transmit at the same time in a half duplex communication link. A contention based channel access (multiple access) protocol is a protocol where data packet collisions may occur. Examples of such protocols are: * The Aloha protocol * Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) * Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance Other examples In telecommunication, the term contention also has the following less usual meanings: *Competition by users of a system for use of the same facility at the same time. This may also be known as oversubscription. The term contention ratio applies specifically to the number of people connected to an ISP who share a set amount of bandwidth. Typical values would be 50:1 for home users (that is to say that 50 people or lines will vie for the same bandwidth) and 20:1 for business users. It is for this reason that the shortfall between supplier-claimed access speeds and those experienced by the consumer once signed-up to a contract is particularly bad at just those times when most consumers actually want to use the service. *A contention can occur in data communications when no station is designated a master station. In contention, each station must monitor the signals and wait for a quiescent condition before initiating a bid for master status.

The 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt occurred on July 5, 1922, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, then the Federal District of Brazil. It was the first revolt of the tenentista movement, in the context of the Brazilian First Republic.  Tenentismo  Tenentismo is the political-military movement of various rebellions by young officers (mostly lieutenants) of the Brazilian army that occurred during the 1920s. The tenentes called for reforms in the power structure. Among these reforms was the end of the cabresto vote (a tool of political control through the abuse of authority, the buying of votes, the use of public institutions, violence, ghost voting, exchange of favors, and fraud). Other goals included the institution of a secret ballot, and the reform of public education. In 1922 until 1930, the tenentes constituted a minority in the officer corps. Their number was around 325, consisting of officers who graduated from Brazil's Escola Militar do Realengo. By 1930, the number of these tenentes exceeded 600 or about 11 percent of the 5,255-strong officer corps on active duty. Although the 1922 revolt at Copacabana fort ended in failure, the sheer audacity by which the small band of rebels attacked a much larger force captured the attention of the public and inspired similar movements by the tenentes later on. Some sources maintained that the uprising was doomed from the start because authorities, including the Brazilian president, knew of the plot. The officers involved were also said to have accepted death. These factors contributed to the way the rebels emerged as martyrs especially for their fellow soldiers. Army Reasoning The Army reasoned that itself was the only force capable of saving the Republic. As a result, the movement was based in only one part of society, the army, and this isolated the Tenentista movement from the rest of the society.  Reasons for the revolt  On October 3, 1919, a civilian - Jo√£o Pandi√° Cal√≥geras - was designated as War Minister for the first time in the history of the Brazilian Republic by President Epit√°cio Pessoa. Cal√≥geras held this post until November 15, 1922. In 1921, the Correio da Manh√£ (Brazil), a Brazilian newspaper published in Rio de Janeiro from 1901 to 1974, published letters supposedly written by Artur Bernardes (Brazilian president from 1922 to 1926) and Raul Soares, a Brazilian politician who was Navy Minister during Epit√°cio Pessoa's government and Secretary of the Interior during Artur Bernardes‚Äô government. These letters included insults directed at the Army and Marshal Hermes da Fonseca; the Brazilian president from 1910 to 1914, and one of the most important figures in the Army during Epit√°cio Pessoa's and Artur Bernardes‚Äô governments. It was later found that the signatures in the letters were forged. In 1922, Artur Bernardes (supposed author of the letters published in 1921) won the Presidential elections. The Militar Club, a traditional military college in Rio de Janeiro, and Borges de Medeiros, a famous Brazilian politician and lawyer, asked for the creation of a court to review the election results. However, the elections were recognized by the Congress, so the court was never created. In June 1922, Epit√°cio Pessoa intervened in the state of Pernambuco‚Äôs elections, and this act was strongly criticized by Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. As a reaction, Epit√°cio ordered Marshal Hermes da Fonseca's arrest and the closure of the Militar Club.  The Copacabana Fort revolt  The revolt was supposed to include supporters in many military bases, but only a few joined in: Fort Copacabana, at Copacabana, some marginal elements from the Military village, Vigia Fort, the Realengo Military School, the 1st Engineering Battalion, navy and army members, and the 1st Military Division. The response of pro-tenentistas was weak because the government received notice that the revolt would happen and removed the crucial pro- tenentista officers from the most important military bases. Copacabana Fort's Main battery Guns pointing towards the Sugar Loaf Mountain. Copacabana Fort is now a Museum and a tourist attraction. The Fort Copacabana rebels fired their cannons against many important government and military bases during the early morning of the 5th. Throughout the rest of the day, the fort was bombed. In the early morning of the 6th, Captain Euclides da Cunha and Lieutenant Siqueira Campos permitted any soldiers who wanted to leave the fort to do so; 273 of 301 left the Fort. Meanwhile, a destroyer and two battleships took up positions near the Fort and started to shell it. Captain Euclides Hermes left to negotiate, but was arrested. The government's last word to the rebels was an order to either surrender or be destroyed. The Tenentistas still inside the Fort then cut a Brazilian flag in 29 pieces, one for each rebel, and decided to march to the Catete Palace, the head office of the Executive Power. Most of them dispersed and only 24 R. S. Rose, O homem mais perigoso do pa√≠s: biografia de Filinto M√ºller, o temido chefe de pol√≠cia da ditadura Vargas.

She was also the original describer of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Biography Noonan was born October 28, 1928 in Burlington, Vermont, the daughter of Francis and Eugenia Noonan. She had three sisters, Beverly, Joan, and Joyce. She studied chemistry at Albertus Magnus College, medicine at the University of Vermont, and became certified in her field in Boston in 1956. She subsequently began work at the University of Iowa. As their first pediatric cardiologist, she noticed that children with a rare type of heart defect called pulmonary valve stenosis often had a characteristic physical appearance with short stature, webbed neck, wide- spaced eyes, and low-set ears. She presented her first paper on the subject in 1963, and after several more papers and recognition, the condition was officially named Noonan syndrome in 1971. Dr. Noonan moved on to the fledgling University of Kentucky medical school in 1961, where she served for over forty years. An endowed chair in pediatric research has been established in her name, and while she semi-retired as of 2007, she was still working at age 85 as of February 2014. She died on July 23, 2020, at the age of 91. Recognition Aside from the rare distinction of having a medical condition named after her, Noonan has received numerous other honors, including the 1971 Helen B.

The auditorium seated nearly 1000 and featured a large stage that was the venue for decades of performances, ceremonies and school functions. The 22 acre site boasted multiple sports fields, a running track and tennis courts, and the Gym was home to decades of sporting events, including Totem Tournaments (basketball). In January 1974, the roof was blown off the building and extensive damage was caused to the interior. The largest graduating class from ADSS was 1988, at over 460 students.

Researchers believe that he may have emigrated from Germany to Philadelphia, and then may have moved from there to East Brandywine Township sometime prior to the American Revolution. He arrived in Philadelphia in 1741 with his parents Johann Reichard and Anna Elizabeth (Roos) Bicking (B√∂cking/B√∂ecking), a brother and two of his three sisters.Develin, Dora Harvey. Historic Lower Merion and Blockley Following his arrival in Pennsylvania, Bicking owned and operated a paper mill, establishing the Bicking paper dynasty that would last well into the 19th century. He also owned a fishery on the Schuylkill River, and operated the Sheetz, or \\"Dove Mill\\", which was thought to be the oldest or second oldest paper mill (to the Rittenhouse mill) in the colonies. As someone who utilized indentured servants, his advertisements for assistance in recapturing \\"runaways\\" can be found in newspapers of the time period. The Continental Congress allocated funds to purchase Bicking's paper for currency production. The bank notes to pay the troops at Valley Forge were printed on his paper. He is mentioned in several of the minutes of the Continental Congress and in the George Washington Papers where Capt. James Lovell explains to General Washington that he thought the minutes of the Continental Congress were buried at Bicking's property to avoid destruction of the documents by the British. He also submitted a petition that papermakers should be exempt from military service. Bicking was named as a Patriot of the Revolution. Many of the second and third generation members of the family are buried in the Bicking family cemetery which has remained preserved for nearly two centuries and is now located on private property in Narberth, Pennsylvania. Frederick Bicking married Mary Catherine Unverzagt of Otwiller, Germany on May 26, 1752 at St. Michael's & Zion Lutheran Church in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Mary Catherine Unverzagt, daughter of Johannes Unverzagt, was also a German Palatine. Of Frederick Bicking's five sons, three were paper makers in Pennsylvania.

Abba consists of four communities. Listed in order of seniority they are Umuokpara, Umudurunna, Ekiti-Afor, and Ogwuaga, which all consist of twenty-eight villages. History of Abba Etymologically, the word Abba means father, which in common usage is called \\"Abba Nna\\". Historically, Abba in Nwangele LGA and Abam in Bende LGA of Abia State originated from the same place. Centuries ago, Field Marshall Ochiagha Uburu left Bende and fought through several towns in a move to demonstrate his military prowess and extract respectability. Uburu finally decided to stay and establish himself in a rocky grove that was known as Ebu-Ogbugha Nkume (rock of ages) and is the location of the present day Abba. The four villages of Abba According to oral history, Ochiagha Uburu originally had five children. They were Okpara, Osuama, Durunna, Ekitiafor, and Ogwuaga. Osuama is now in Mbano.

Even his Flemish name is not known with certainty. He is believed to have been a native of Antwerp who trained as a painter and engraver in his hometown. The first record on Campolargo in Seville is 17 November 1640 when he is recorded with his wife, Angela Adriaensens, at the baptism of their son in the parish of the Blessed Sacrament in Seville Cathedral. Years later, in October 1651, he was again recorded when taking an examination in the \\"art of painter of images on plates\\" with Sebasti√°n de Llanos y Vald√©s. Campolargo, declared in an official document that he was \\"of the Flemish nation and age 46 or so.\\"Fernando Quiles Garcia, Pedro de Campolargo, pintor flamenco, in: Laboratorio de Arte, Revista del Departamento de Historia del Arte, Universidad de Sevilla, n¬∫ 3 (1990), pp. 265-270 In 1660 there is a record of Campolargo receiving an apprentice. In Seville, Campolargo formed part of a group of Flemish artists, principally from Antwerp, such as Cornelis Schut III, Jan (Juan) van Mol and Sebasti√°n Faix. Some of them such as Schut and Campolargo were also involved in the establishment and promotion of the Academy of Fine Arts of Seville founded in 1660. Until 1663 Campolargo was one of the academy members who promoted the drawing style of Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo. Campolargo is again documented in 1671 while working on the Triumph elevation in the cathedral on the occasion of the celebrations for the canonization of San Fernando, charging for the prints 1800 reales. He dictated his will on May 25, 1675. He was buried on 23 January 1687. He left a son of the same name who in historical documents is also referred to as a painter. Campolargo is documented as having worked in the so-called 'minor' genres such as landscape and portrait painting and worked also as a stage decorator.

Life and work His father, Pedro, was a silversmith and his mother, Juana (n√©e Passano) was descended from the Peroli brothers; painters from Genoa who had worked on the frescoes at the . At the age of fourteen, he was apprenticed to Luis Trist√°n in Toledo. He does not appear on the official record again until 1630, when he passed the exam for the painter's guild in Seville. It is presumed that he completed his training in Madrid with Juan van der Hamen, due to comparable stylistic elements in his early works.P√©rez S√°nchez, Alfonso E. (1992). Pintura barroca en Espa√±a 1600-1750. Madrid : Ediciones C√°tedra. From 1632 to 1634, he created the \\"Magdalena Repentant\\" at the , which is the only religious work he is known to have produced. The figures show the influence of Francisco de Zurbaran, but his still-life sensibility is displayed in the items arranged on a table, in the style of a \\"vanitas\\". He married and had two daughters, but was already a widower when he made out his will in 1670. Ten years earlier, he and other notable artists, such as Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, Juan de Vald√©s Leal and Francisco Herrera, had participated in the creation of the \\"Academia de dibujo de Sevilla\\" (drawing academy), in which he collaborated until his death. Although he painted a wide variety of still lifes, his true specialty was floral arrangements; always presented in bowls or vases, with a casual look, and occasionally accompanied by living creatures, such as butterflies. Some have architectural perspectives; in the style of contemporary Italian models. He has been credited with the painting, \\"Death and the Knight\\", at the Hospital de la Caridad; an attribution based on the arrangement and symbolic value of numerous everyday objects.

Visual censorship was exploited in a political context, particularly during the political purges of Joseph Stalin, where the Soviet government attempted to erase some purged figures from Soviet history, and took measures which included altering images and destroying film. The USSR curtailed access to pornography, which was specifically prohibited by Soviet law. Censorship of pornographic images Soviet law prohibited the creation and distribution of pornography under Article 228 of the criminal code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and analogous legislation adopted by other republics of the Soviet Union. While nude shots appeared in a number of Soviet films before the glasnost reform of the 1980s, the 1988 film Little Vera was the first to include an explicit sex scene. Pornographic images and videotapes were smuggled into the Soviet Union for illegal distribution. In addition to the anti-pornographic law, such smuggling was prohibited by legal provisions giving the Soviet state the exclusive right to conduct foreign economic trade. Censorship of historical photographs =The Water Commissar= This image taken by the Moscow Canal was taken when Nikolai Yezhov was water commissar. After he fell from power, he was arrested, shot, and his image removed by the censors. Yezhov was born in Saint Petersburg on May 1, 1895, and from 1915 to 1917 Yezhov served in the Tsarist Russian Army. He joined the Bolsheviks on May 5, 1917, in Vitebsk, a few months before the October Revolution. During the Russian Civil War (1919‚Äì1921), he fought in the Red Army. After February 1922, he worked in the political system, rising in 1935 to the Central Committee of the Communist Party; in the next year he became a secretary of the Central Committee. From February 1935 to March 1939 he was also the Chairman of the Central Commission for Party Control. In 1935 he wrote a paper in which he argued that political opposition must eventually lead to violence and terrorism; this became in part the ideological basis of the Purges. He became People's Commissar for Internal Affairs (head of the NKVD) and a member of the Presidium Central Executive Committee on September 26, 1936. Under Yezhov, the purges reached their height, with roughly half of the Soviet political and military establishment being imprisoned or shot, along with hundreds of thousands of others, suspected of disloyalty or \\"wrecking.\\" Yezhov was blamed for these \\"excesses\\" and on April 10, 1939, he was arrested. On February 4, 1940, he was executed. =Lenin's speech= Lenin's speech, an image edited after Stalin's rise to remove Trotsky and Kamenev, Stalin's main opponents On May 5, 1920, Lenin gave a famous speech to a crowd of Soviet troops in Sverdlov Square, Moscow. In the foreground were Leon Trotsky and Lev Kamenev. The photo was later altered and both were removed by censors. Leon Trotsky Leon Trotsky () was a Ukrainian-born ethnically-Jewish Bolshevik revolutionary and Marxist theorist. He was an influential politician in the early days of the Soviet Union, first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army and People's Commissar of War. He was also among the first members of the Politburo. He became an enemy of the State and was erased from Soviet history after leading the failed struggle of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and the increasing bureaucratization of the Soviet Union. Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party and deported from the Soviet Union in the Great Purge. As the head of the Fourth International, he continued in exile to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, and was eventually assassinated in Mexico by Ram√≥n Mercader, a Soviet agent who used an ice axe to fatally stab Trotsky. Trotsky's ideas form the basis of Trotskyism, a variation of communist theory, which remains a major school of Marxist thought that is opposed to the theories of Stalinism. =October Revolution celebration= On November 7, 1919, this image was snapped of the Soviet leadership celebrating the second anniversary of the October Revolution. After Trotsky and his allies fell from power, a number of figures were removed from the image, including Trotsky and two people over to Lenin's left, wearing glasses and giving a salute. Lev Kamenev two men over on Lenin's right was another of Stalin's opponents and below the boy in front of Trotsky, another bearded figure, Artemic Khalatov the one time Commissar of publishing, was also edited out. Lev Kamenev Kamenev was born in Moscow, the son of a Jewish railway worker and a Russian Orthodox housewife. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1901 and its Bolshevik faction when the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in August 1903. He climbed the ranks of the Soviet leadership and was briefly the nominal head of the Soviet state in 1917 and later chairman (1923‚Äì1924) of the ruling Politburo. After Sergei Kirov's murder on December 1, 1934, which precipitated Stalin's Great Purges, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their closest associates were once again expelled from the Communist Party and arrested in December 1934. They were tried in January 1935 and were forced to admit \\"moral complicity\\" in Kirov's assassination. Zinoviev was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Kamenev to five years in prison. Kamenev was charged separately in early 1935 in connection with the Kremlin Case and, although he refused to confess, was sentenced to ten years in prison. In August 1936, after months of careful preparations and rehearsals in Soviet secret police prisons, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 others, mostly Old Bolsheviks, were put on trial again in the Moscow Trials. Kamenev and all the others were found guilty and were executed by shooting on August 25, 1936. =Postcard= On November 7, 1917, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin led his leftist revolutionaries in a revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still using the Julian Calendar at the time, so it is still called the October Revolution). The October Revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February of that year, replacing Russia's short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks' Red Army. During the Revolution a number of pictures were taken of successful fighters celebrating their victories. These were often used as postcards after the war. The background of the original image includes a store that says in Russian, \\"Watches, gold and silver\\". The image was then changed to read, \\"Struggle for your rights\\", and a flag was changed to more clearly read, \\"Down with the monarchy ‚Äì long live the Republic!\\". =Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class= The Union for Struggle of the Liberation of the Working Class (), a St Petersburg-based organization, was founded by a number of Russian revolutionaries including Mikhail Kalinin and Lenin. They would eventually merge with other groups to lay the foundation for the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP). The RSDRP formed in 1898 in Minsk to unite the various revolutionary organizations into one party.(It would later split into Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, with the Bolsheviks eventually becoming the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.) This picture, taken in February 1897, records a meeting of the St. Petersburg chapter of the Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class. Shortly after the picture was taken the Okhrana arrested the whole group. The members received various punishments, with Lenin being arrested, held by authorities for fourteen months and then released and exiled to the village of Shushenskoye in Siberia, where he mingled with such notable Marxists as Georgy Plekhanov, who had introduced socialism to Russia. Standing at center is Alexander Malchenko. At the time of this picture he was an engineering student and his mother would let Lenin hide out at her house. After his arrest he spent some time in exile before returning in 1900 and abandoning the revolution. He moved to Moscow, where he worked as a senior engineer in various state departments before in 1929 being arrested, wrongfully accused of being a \\"wrecker\\" and executed on November 18, 1930. After his arrest and execution he was airbrushed out of all reproductions. In 1958 he was posthumously rehabilitated and reappeared in reproductions of the image. =\\"Lost\\" cosmonaut= After cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died in a training accident in 1961, the Soviet government airbrushed him out of photographs of the first group of cosmonauts. As Bondarenko had already appeared in publicly available photographs, the deletions led to rumours of cosmonauts dying in failed launches.Oberg, James, Uncovering Soviet Disasters, Chapter 10: \\"Dead Cosmonauts\\", pp 156-176, Random House, New York, 1988, retrieved January 8, 2008 Both Bondarenko's existence and the nature of his death were secret until 1986. =Flag on the Reichstag= As Berlin fell in the closing days of the World War in Europe, Red Army photographer Yevgeny Khaldei gathered some soldiers and posed a shot of them hoisting the flag (called the Victory Banner) on the roof of the Reichstag building. The photo represented a historic moment, the defeat of Germany in a war that cost the Soviet Union tens of millions of lives. After taking the symbolic photo, Khaldei quickly returned to Moscow. He further edited the image at the request of the editor-in-chief of the Ogonyok, who noticed that Sen. Sgt. Abdulkhakim Ismailov, who is supporting the flag-bearer in the photo, had a wristwatch on each arm, indicating he had been looting. Later Soviet sources claimed that the extra watch was actually an Adrianov compassRare Historical Photos: The Soviet flag over the Reichstag, 1945. Retrieved November 26, 2017. and that Khaldei, in order to avoid controversy, doctored the photo to remove the watch from Ismailov's right wrist. Khaldei also copied smoke in the background of another photo to make the scene more dramatic. The photo was published May 13, 1945 in the Ogonyok magazine. While many photographers took pictures of flags on the roof it was Khaldei's image that stuck.

London Assurance Co., 113 U.S. 51 (1885), was a fire insurance case regarding two policies of fire insurance, issued March 10, 1883, by the London Assurance Corporation, of London for the property of the firm of Drennen, Starr & Everett, a business in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The loss occurred on July 29, 1883.. At the ensuing trial, the amount was not disputed, but since each policy contained a provision that it should be void if the property insured \\"be sold or transferred, or any change takes place in title or possession, (except by succession by reason of the death of the insured,) whether by legal process, or judicial decree, or voluntary transfer or conveyance,\\" all interest or liability on the part of the issuer would immediately terminate.' The defendant disputed its liability on the ground that Drennen, Starr & Everett, on May 24, 1883, before the loss, admitted one Arndt as a partner in their firm, and that thereby, without its knowledge or consent, and by the voluntary act of the plaintiffs, the title, interest, and possession of the insured in the property was changed, and the policies became void. The plaintiffs denied that Arndt became a member of their firm, and substantial proof was given that Arndt resided in Sandusky, Ohio. He visited Minneapolis in May 1883, and first became acquainted with plaintiffs Drennen and Starr on or about May 20. Negotiations then commenced with Drennen and Starr, who acted for their firm. In the court's judgment of the agreement as a whole, the parties did not contemplate or establish a partnership. The agreement was for a corporation with all the payments and other specified items for preparation for its formation and no change in the title or possession of the property.

We do know that his father, a painter named Jer√≥nimo de Loarte, was probably his first teacher and survived him. At his death, he was in charge of a prestigious studio in Madrid and, just before his death, named the artist Pedro Orrente as his executor. His religious paintings varied in quality; some were even copies. His style is closely related to that of Luis Trist√°n, and the influence of Orrente is obvious. A large canvas of \\"Saint Bernard with his Monks\\", in the convent of the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande, once believed to be the work of Francisco Pacheco, has been reattributed to him.

Vol. 5, J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott & J. Sargatal (eds.), Barcelona, 1999. It is one of 6 species in the genus Oreotrochilus, and can be distinguished from its relatives by subtle differences in plumage coloration. Hillstars of this genus are distinct among the hummingbird family Trochilidae because of their preference for high- elevation environments, and the development of many behavioral and physiological adaptations in order to survive the cold climate of the high Andes.  Description  The green-headed hillstar is a species of South American hummingbird ranging in length from 12‚Äì13 cm and weighing between 7.9-8.4 g. The green-headed hillstar is a sexually dimorphic species. The males are more brightly colored than females. Males have a bronzed-green posterior, including the forehead, crown, back, sides and rump. Their wings are a dark contrast to their back. The primaries and secondaries are typically a dark black/brown and green. Their tail's central rectrices are a soft bronze and their wide blunt ended outer rectrices are nearly white. On their anterior, They have a metallic emerald green throat that may appear bronze or blue in certain angles. their underparts are white with a black streak down the center. The females share a similar physique as males, primarily differing in throat and tail feathers. Their throats are white with dotted lines of green to grey spots. Females have darker tails than males. Their tails are green and black with white webbing along the base of the outer rectrices. Juveniles resemble adult females.  Taxonomy  First described in 1895, it has traditionally been considered a subspecies of the Andean hillstar, Oreotrochilus estella, but is now increasingly treated as a separate species based on differences in genetics and plumage.Sornoza-Molina, F., J. F. Freile, J. Nilsson, N. Krabbe & E. Bonaccorso. 2018. A striking, critically endangered, new species of hillstar (Trochilidae: Oreotrochilus) from the southwestern Andes of Ecuador. Auk 135(4): 1146‚Äì1171. It is more closely related to the blue-throated hillstar and black-breasted hillstar than the Andean hillstar. Females of these are very similar, but the males are easily separated. The male blue-throated hillstar has a blue throat and the male black-breasted hillstar has almost entirely black underparts. Compared to the Andean hillstar, the male green-headed hillstar has a brighter green head and a black (not brown) line to the central underparts. After the recent discovery of a new hillstar species, Oreatrochilus cyanolaemus, studies think the green- headed hillstar is a sister species to the O. cyanolaemus. This supports the green-headed hillstar's differentiation from the Andean hillstar. The binomial name commemorates Polish ornithologist Jan Sztolcman (Jean Stanislaus Stolzmann). There are currently seven species in the genus Oreatrochilus. * Green-headed hillstar (Oreotrochilus stolzmanni) * Andean hillstar (Oreotrochilus estella) * Ecuadorian hillstar (Oreotrochilus chimborazo) * Black-breasted hillstar (Oreotrochilus melanogaster) * Wedge-tailed hillstar (Oreotrochilus adela) * White-sided hillstar (Oreotrochilus leucopleurus) * Blue-throated hillstar (Oreotrochilus cyanolaemus) This species radiation is hypothesized to be a result of allopatric speciation.  Habitat and distribution  The green-headed hillstar is distributed across north and central Peru, and extends up to the southernmost portion of the Ecuadorian Andes. Its habitat includes rocky alpine grasslands, meadows, and scrublands populated by Puya and Polylepsis stands. They are found at altitudes of 3,600 to 4,200 meters (11,800 to 13,800 ft) and are known to seasonally shift to lower elevations.  Behaviour  Similar to other hummingbird species, the green-headed hillstar has one of the highest mass-specific metabolic rates of all homeothermic animals, and therefore must consume a large quantity of sugar everyday in order to sustain this high metabolism. To reduce the metabolic cost of energy during the night when they are not feeding, hummingbirds are one of the few bird species that enter a state of torpor, or deep sleep, to reduce their metabolic rate to 1/15 of its normal rate. Hillstar species, like the green-headed hillstar, have further developed these behavioural adaptations in order to live in the especially cold climate of the Andes. For example, on cold nights the green-headed hillstar enters a state of torpor and will sleep in sheltered places like cavities in rocks or caves, and often sleep nestled close together with several other hillstars in order to reduce heat loss from their bodies. Additionally, while hummingbirds are distinct for their ability to hover by producing power on both the forward and back wing beat, in order to save energy the green-headed hillstar rarely hovers and instead clings to flowers to feed on their nectar, as well as only flying short distances. These behaviors can help minimize the energy required to maintain their body temperature and metabolism, and reduce energy expenditure which helps them thrive in the cold, harsh climate of the Andes Mountains. = Vocalization = Call is a series of fast ‚Äútseep‚Äù . Other vocalizations include a song-like display call, similar to that of the Andean hillstar. = Diet = Like other hummingbirds, the green-headed hill star is a specialized nectarivore, and feeds preferably on the nectar and pollen of Puya, Cacti, Chuquiraga, and Cajophora/Caiophora. They are also known to occasionally feed on flying insects mid-air using a hawking technique. They tend to perch on flowers within 3 feet of the ground, and will occasionally come and rest on the ground. Males are highly territorial of feeding grounds. The green-headed hillstar is one of few hillstars that appears to have a mutualistic relationship with the Chuqiraga plant genus. an estimate of 91% of its range overlaps with that of the Chugiraga. This Plant genus is reliant on northern hillstars for pollination. = Reproduction = The green-headed hillstar will begin breeding during its second year of life, with the breeding season usually starting in February and ending in June, though sometimes continuing into august. A cup-shaped nest is built out of plant fibers and moss in protective places like rock cavities, under overhangs, in roofs or houses, or inside old open buildings like barns. The female lays a clutch of two white eggs, and incubates them for 19 to 21 days. When the eggs hatch, the chicks are generally dark with two dorsal rows of grey natal down or plumulaceous feathers. Fledging of these young birds occurs approximately 36 to 40 after hatching. Courtship in the green-headed hillstar is not well studied, but evidence suggests males display using various postures to enhance their iridescent green throat, and this is display accompanied by melodious twittering.  Conservation and potential threats  According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the green-headed hillstar is ranked as least concern due to it being locally common in its extensive geographic range throughout the Peruvian Andes. While their population has not been thoroughly quantified, evidence suggests that the total number of mature individuals is greater than 10,000 and their population trends are stable, which provides further evidence of the green-headed hillstar's Red List status of least concern. In 2019, 35% of the green-heeded hillstar‚Äôs Peru range overlapped with mineral mining concessions. Due to the rocky and arid nature of their habitat, agriculture does not pose a threat to their habitat at this point in time.

He is now best known for his publication in the 1640s of his father's pioneer works on chemistry, which link the origins of the science to the study of alchemy. From his early work as a physician, he became a kabbalist and together with Henry More of the Cambridge Platonists he annotated Christian Knorr von Rosenroth's translations of kabbalist texts. Contacts and movement He led an itinerant life in wanderings in Europe, an adjective already applied to him by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury in his 1711 Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times. He self-identified as a \\"wandering eremite\\". Franciscus van Helmont had important groups of contacts in the Netherlands, where he knew Adam Boreel and Serrarius, and later in life, in 'the Lantern', the circle around the Rotterdam merchant Benjamin Furly that included John Locke. He was an influence on Franciscus van den Enden, and on the Spanish medical professor Juan de Cabriada. In Amsterdam around 1690 he worked out theory to support the work Johann Konrad Ammann was doing with deaf people. He also spent much time in Germany and England. From 1644, when his father died, to 1658, when Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor ennobled him, he was constantly involved in diplomacy for German princes and their families. Life from 1660 In 1661 he was in Kitzingen when he was forcibly taken by soldiers of Philipp Wilhelm, Elector Palatine to Rome and a prison of the Inquisition, where he was tortured and kept for 18 months. His first work was a 1667 Latin treatise Alphabeti veri naturalis hebraici brevissima delineatio (usual short English title Alphabet of Nature) on Adamic language, which he equated with Hebrew. He argued that the Hebrew alphabet implicitly gave a pronunciation guide, analogous to a musical notation for the tongue and voice. He was a friend of Gottfried Leibniz, who wrote his epitaph, and he introduced Leibniz to Christian Knorr von Rosenroth in 1671. Leibniz writing in 1669 took the \\"Helmontians\\" seriously, as one of three contending groups in philosophy, the others being the traditionalist followers of Aristotle, and the Cartesians. The Helmontians comprised remaining Paracelsans and those who took the writings of Jan Baptist van Helmont to heart. He came to England in 1670, meeting the king, Charles II.Masonic quotes by Brothers. themasonictrowel.com He was on a diplomatic mission on behalf of Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine. At this time he met Robert Boyle, a leading Helmontian chemist. Through his relationship as physician to Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway, he began to attend Quaker meetings, in 1675.Anne Finche, Viscountess Conway (1631‚Äì1678 or 79) . oregonstate.edu In return he introduced her to kabbalist thought. He was resident at the old Ragley Hall from 1671 until 1679, when she died. Twenty years later, he was a figure in the Keithian Controversy, a schism formed in the Quakers, in which van Helmont took the side of George Keith who broke away. Keith had translated van Helmont's Two Hundred Queries in 1684; it was a work of speculative theology, written in Latin in a simultaneously published version and anonymous until the following year, and van Helmont had hoped for an effect on Quaker belief, at the time still plastic and uncodified. But he encountered serious resistance from George Fox. Keith collaborated on van Helmont's Paradoxal Discourses of 1685, but went to some pains to deny he held the same opinions. In a A Cabbalistical Dialogue (Latin version first, 1677, in English 1682) he launched a defence of kabbalist metaphysics. He had been closely associated with the Kabbala Denudata of Rosenroth. The Dialogue puts matter and spirit on a continuum, describing matter as a \\"coalition\\" of monads. There are various views on the evolution of the concept of \\"monad\\", which Conway and Van Helmont shared with Leibniz. Physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein found this to be a kind of Pandeism. From the same period, the attributed work Adumbratio Kabbalae Christianae, sometimes included with the Kabbala Denudata as an anonymous essay, purported to be a tract to convert Jews to Christianity, but equally served as an introduction to Christian Kabbalist views, and the identification of Adam Kadmon of the Lurianic Kabbalah with Christ. In his last years he was in Germany, and continued to work closely with Leibniz. It has been argued that Leibniz may have written the final book to appear under van Helmont's name, the Quaedam praemeditatae et consideratae cogitationes super quattuor capita libri primi Moisis (Amsterdam 1697), translated in English in 1701 as Premeditate and Considerate Thoughts, on the early chapters of the Book of Genesis.

His work has been part of creative projects such as Banksy's Dismaland, Beyond The Streets and The Cunning Little Vixen, a new media production of the Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek opera produced by the Cleveland Orchestra. He works in many mediums and starting in 2008 began producing cardboard sculptures that focus on white forms with pinstripe outlines to convey the notion of 3 dimensional drawings. In 2018 he was a participating artist in Beyond The Streets artshow curated by Roger Gastman. In 2019 Barminski created a cardboard living room where visitors were encouraged to play with the artwork for the New York City iteration of Beyond the Streets. Art by Barminski ca 1996  Life and art  Born in Chicago, Barminski moved with his family to Fort Worth, Texas when he was 10. While attending the University of Texas at Austin as an art major, he was a contributor of satirical cartoons to the student newspaper, The Daily Texan. The cartoon strip, entitled \\"King of the Pre-Fab\\", featured Dick Nixon, a used car salesman and campus gadfly. Despite repeated efforts by the student's association to have him removed, Barminski went on to create the underground comicbook, Tex Hitler, Fascist Gun in the West. Author and cultural critic, Greil Marcus references this character in Artforum as being an offshoot of the Situationist International political movement: \\"What's most remarkable about Bill Barminski's Fascist Gun in the West is how quickly and completely it pulls you into its twisted, yet utterly familiar little world\\". After dropping out of art school in 1985, Barminski moved to Los Angeles where he continued to produce his hand-bound comic books. He began in earnest to paint. His first show in 1986 in a downtown L.A. gallery, Oranges/Sardines, created a minor sensation and resulted in modest sales. His work caught the eye of record producer, Scott Arundale, who commissioned him to create the album cover for an Industrial/Tribal band, \\"Death Ride '69\\". The image of Elvis Presley as Jesus Christ was later acknowledged and reprinted in the Greil Marcus book, Dead Elvis: A Chronicle of a Cultural Obsession (1991), about the phenomenon of the Rock 'n' Roll icon in the years since his death. The themes and style of his work critique mass media and consumer culture. His exhibitions usually contain installation elements showcasing a video work produced for each show. His richly textured paintings have been reviewed in numerous publications such as Flash Art, Art in America, ARTnews, Visions Art Quarterly, New American Paintings, and the LA Weekly. Tobey Crockett describes his work in a 1996 article for Art in America: \\"The advertising-derived images that Barminski incorporates into his paintings are meant to evoke postwar America. Like filmmaker David Lynch and others, Barminski is interested in the ominously surreal side of the good life.\\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n3_v84/ai_18119086/pg_1 Art in America Barminski's paintings are prominently featured in the movie Horseplayer (1990). The film stars Brad Dourif as a homicidal artist living in downtown Los Angeles and Barminski makes a cameo appearance. His paintings have adorned the walls of several feature films including Sliver (1993) and Zero Effect (1998) as well as the TV show, Friends. In 1996, he designed the album art for the School of Fish recording, \\"Human Cannonball\\". In 1998, Barminski is credited with designing the largest and most expensive billboard ever commissioned by Absolut Vodka which remained on the Sunset strip for over two years. More recently Barminski has created artwork and sculpture in cardboard. In 2011 he was part of a show in London at POW Gallery that featured artists Evol, Tilt, Dran, Paul Insect, Jimmy Caulty, Banksy and others. In 2014 Barminski collaborated with opera director Yuval Sharon to create an innovative version of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's opera The Cunning Little Vixen. Performed by the Cleveland Orchestra at the Severance Hall and conducted by Franz Welser-M√∂st, the production returned the opera to its comic-strip roots; Jan√°ƒçek was inspired by a daily comic strip that followed the adventures of a female fox called Sharp Ears. Barminski and Christopher Louie created a hand- drawn animated world that captured the simple yet beautiful world of the Cunning Little Vixen. In 2015, Barminski was part of Banksy's Dismaland art show along with artists Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Escif and others. For Dismaland he created a cardboard security entrance that every visitor to the park had to enter through. Since 1998, Barminski has taught digital art and design at UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. Art by Barminski, ca 2005 Music video In 1999, Baz Luhrmann hired Barminski to create a music video for his song \\"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\\", based on Mary Schmich's newspaper column, \\"Wear Sunscreen\\". The spoken word piece is set to music by Luhrmann and features animation and home movies of Barminski and his family. The video aired on all major networks in the U.S. and was featured on The Tonight Show, The Today Show and The View as well as VH1 and MTV. It also appeared in the UK, Australia and Japan. The Goo Goo Dolls commissioned him the following year to create a video to be presented on stage as part of their 2000 summer concert tour. Entitled \\"Greed in Action\\", the four-minute piece features stock footage and original flash animations by the artist including American vintage automobiles being dropped from B-52 Stratofortress bombers. Barminski worked with director Peter Howitt and Oscar-winning editor Zach Staenberg to create multiple video sequences for the feature film Antitrust (2001), starring Tim Robbins and loosely based on the real-life creator of a major software conglomerate. In 2001, H&M;, an international clothing retailer of Sweden, commissioned him to create a music video to present to its corporate staff entitled \\"Add Your Note\\".http://www.mergefilms.com/merge/video/qtbarminski/hm.html Barminski joined forces with Christopher Louie in 2007, to create a fictional film director named Walter Robot. The very same robot stars in his own video for the band Modest Mouse called Missed the Boat. The duo has created numerous videos for bands such as Gnarls Barkley, Rob Thomas, Hawthorn Heights, Underoath and Death Cab for Cutie. Their animated Death Cab for Cutie video for the song \\"Grapevine Fires\\" won several awards including Best Music Video at the 2009 Los Angeles Film Festival and was nominated for Breakthrough Video of the Year MTV, 2009. Art by Barminski, ca 2002 Digital media Barminski is an accomplished Flash, Shockwave and After Effects designer with his many musical and digital art compositions available on his website. Macromedia frequently awarded him \\"Flash Site of the Day\\" during the late 1990s as he constantly tinkered with and updated his on-line works. Barminski is author and co-creator (along with Webster Lewin and Jerry Hesketh) of \\"The Encyclopedia of Clamps\\", Fine Art Forum an interactive CD-ROM game Wired Magazine featuring an amusement park of games and social and political commentary. It was awarded first prize for Best Foreign Package at the Tokyo MultiMedia Grand Prixhttp://www.dcaj.org/oldgp/97awards/package/work10.htm in 1997. During the same year, Barminski and Webster Lewin created the original character Cyclops Boy, featured in the internet series Cyclops Boy: The One- Eyed Detective in Satellite Sky. It won Best Multimedia Award at the FilmWinter Fest in Stuttgart, Germany. In 2006, Barminski created a video for Mortified, the spoken word project ripped from the pages of real life. Mortified is a comic excavation of adolescent artifacts (journals, letters, poems, lyrics, home movies, stories and more) as shared by their original authors before total strangers. The innovative video has been hailed as a breakthrough in guerilla web marketing. In 2009 Barminski and Chris Louie worked with Joel Stein to create an animated short, \\"The Adventures of Joel Stein\\" which was included in the Sundance 2009 Film festival.

The subject is a pretty shepherdess who loves two young men, but loses both when they discover her fickleness. Believed lost for many years, the score is the source of arias in some of Handel's later, more celebrated operas. History In 1706 Handel left Hamburg for Italy, and in May 1707 began living as composer-in-residence with the Marchese Francesco Maria Ruspoli, traveling between the Bonelli Palace in Rome and the Ruspoli estate. Clori, Tirsi, e Fileno was written sometime before October of that year ‚Äì a copyist's bill for the work is dated October 14, 1707. There is no certain record of any performance, but it may have been given privately before Handel left for Florence later that year to conduct the premiere of Rodrigo, his first Italian opera, which shares an aria with the cantata. The cantata was never revived, and for centuries was known only from a fragmentary manuscript score kept in the British Library. A version of this fragment was published by Chrysander in 1889. However, in 1960 musicologist Rudolf Ewerhart announced the discovery of a complete score in the Santini Collection at M√ºnster, the only one in existence. Comparison of the complete score with the earlier fragment in the British Library reveals revisions made late in composition: Handel had originally closed the cantata with a cynical duet for the two deceived lovers, \\"Senza occhi\\" (\\"Without eyes\\") in which they heap scorn on womankind and renounce love forever. He replaced this with a more light-hearted trio in which the young woman and her disappointed lovers all join, \\"Vivere e non amar\\" (\\"To live and not to love\\"). In August 2012 the work was performed as an immersive piece at the Gladstone Hotel in Toronto, Canada. It was presented in a modern setting to an English libretto (translated by playwright Deborah Pearson) under the title A Synonym for Love. It featured sopranos Tracy Smith Bessette and Emily Atkinson as Clori and Tirsi (Theresa), respectively, and countertenor Scott Belluz as Fileno (Phil). The production was presented by Toronto-based Volcano Theatre and featured accompaniment by Classical Music Consort on period instruments, conducted by Ashiq Aziz. Musical connections Handel reused the aria \\"Un sospiretto\\" twice, that same year in Rodrigo, and in 1732 in the expanded Italian-English version of Acis and Galatea. \\"Come la rondinella\\" was also included in the Acis and Galatea revision. The music for \\"Amo Tirsi\\" was used twice more, although with different texts. It was adapted first as \\"Se vuoi pace\\" in Agrippina (1709), and again as \\"As when the dove\\" in the original, all-English version of Acis and Galatea (1718). Two of the duets were reused in Rinaldo (1711). The overture, in a keyboard reduction, became the opening movement of the G-minor suite in Handel's 1st volume of harpsichord suites, published in 1720. And in 1734 it was again heard with full orchestra, appended to the pastiche opera Oreste. References * Adapted from the essay \\"Handel: Clori, Tirsi, e Fileno,\\" by Anthony Hicks.

Life and career Eine became known for his alphabet lettering on shop shutters. Some of these letters have been mapped for ease of finding. He has also taken his lettering to the streets of Paris, Stockholm, Hastings and Newcastle upon Tyne. Eine first started to explore more commercial avenues in a workshop above the Dragon Bar in Leonard Street, London (since demolished). Eine produced a number of custom clothing designs notably some custom \\"VANDALS\\" sweatshirts and started to explore screen prints, eventually founding the cult screen print company Pictures On Walls (POW) with Banksy. Eine produced many of the hand pulled prints for artists represented by POW including Jamie Hewlett, Mode2, Modern Toss and David Shrigley. His natural talent for colour combinations meant that he was able to enhance the work supplied by the artists. He left this position to continue to pursue his own solo career in 2008. At this time Eine contributed to sticker graffiti and was prolific in East London with his neon and black EINE stickers (multiple EINE names). Eine first came to prominence in the \\"commercial\\" graffiti scene through his symbiotic partnership with the London graffiti artist Banksy; through Eine, Banksy was able to access the underground scene and through Banksy Eine accessed the commercial world. Eine's shutter lettering on Hackney Road, London In his commercial work he has produced numerous lettering styles including Shutter, NewCircus, Neon, Elton, Vandal ~~ism,~~ Tenderloin and Wendy. In 2007, the Tower Hamlets Partnership began to survey residents of Brick Lane to ask whether they considered his graffiti offensive and should be removed. The result was that the council treated graffiti as vandalism.Banksy works to be painted over. Tower Hamlets policy on the BBC News website The Council has since revised the policy on graffiti, aiming to keep street art that is popular and unoffensive because it attracts tourism.Removing blight and protecting street art. Tower Hamlets policy in 2019 In May 2010 Ben Eine painted a complete alphabet on Middlesex Street in East London. The shutters and murals on which he painted his colours and typography can be seen in London's Shoreditch, Brick Lane and Broadway Market areas. Middlesex Street was re-christened Alphabet Street by the residents and described by The Times as \\"a street now internationally recognized as a living piece of art with direct links to The White House\\". In July 2010, President Barack Obama was presented with a painting by Eine, Twenty First Century City, as an official gift from the British prime minister, David Cameron. \\\\- \\\\- Eine was so surprised that he subsequently created \\"The Strangest Week\\", an artwork of giant letters made out of \\"smileys\\" along Hackney Road.\\"Ben Eine: the art of the States\\", Hackney Citizen 3 August 2010 Eine's solo show (March 2011) at White Walls gallery in San Francisco sold out prior to opening. He was also included in the biggest exhibition of street art to date \\"Art in the Streets\\" at MOCA, Los Angeles, in April 2011. Eine's work was featured at Art Below's The Peace Project.http://www.designweek.co.uk/whats- on/the-peace-project/3035327.article His work at the show contained his graffiti typography. One of his pieces that simply spelled out the word love titled \\"Circus Love\\" was displayed at Regent's Park. This had previously being featured in Art Below's July 2012 show where it was placed on the wall of Oxford Circus tube station on the Central Line. Eine joined a growing list of street artists who have exhibited with Art Below such as Banksy, Inkie, Mike Ballard and Goldie. In 2012, the typographer Chank Diesel released Tenderloin, a free font designed in collaboration with Eine. In 2013, Edition House and Gallery Nelly Duff released \\"Tenderloin A-Z\\", a 52-colour silkscreen based on the Tenderloin font. In 2020 Ben Eine designed a pod for the London Eye's 20th anniversary In January 2020, Central Saint Martins college named a class room after Ben Eine. Charitable work Throughout Eine's career, he has made numerous charitable contributions, including donations to Shelter and War Child through sales at Christie's auction house.\\"Street Artist Ben Eine Donates Work to War Child Charity for Auction at Christie's\\", Hang-Up Gallery, 19 August 2011 \\\\- Mike Brooke, \\"Street artist Ben Eine raises ‚Äòunexpected‚Äô cash for Shelter homeless charity\\", East London Advertiser, 31 August 2016 Eine joined efforts towards raising awareness and support around mental health with the Movember Foundation and Sotheby‚Äôs Charity Auction, who launched a sale of ten dynamic new works from acclaimed street artists across the globe. Spearheaded by the artist D*Face, the initiative included original pieces from Felipe Pantone, Shepard Fairey, Jonathan Yeo, Invader, Okuda, Alexis Diaz, Conor Harrington and Vhils. Collectively, \\"each artist created an agenda-setting piece motivated by, and aimed at nurturing, open conversations surrounding men‚Äôs mental health and suicide prevention\\".

Youth empowerment and development has also been an issue Eine ha contributed towards by participating in projects such as Youth Unity Day, to inspire positivity and draw young people away from violence. In 2011, Eine was invited by Amnesty International to design its 50th anniversary poster, joining other artists such as Picasso and Miro in supporting the charity through art.  Other endeavours  In January 2018, Eine launched the first collection for his clothing company EINE London, at London Fashion Week: Men's. In August 2019, Eine launched his creative studio OurTypes. To celebrate the launch of OurTypes he painted every letter of the alphabet on shutters in East London. OurTypes is a multidisciplinary creative studio focused on words. It collaborates with other artists on font releases and global brands on commercial projects. In August 2019, OurTypes launched Eine's most notorious typeface, New Circus font, for personal use.  Eine in popular culture  In January 2008, Eine was featured in an article in London's Time Out magazine as one of the six best new street artists working in the capital. There is a chapter on Eine in Street Renegades: New Underground Art by Francesca Gavin and he is also featured in The Art Of Rebellion 2: World Of Urban Art Activism by Christian Hundertmark, and he was featured in Sebastian Peiter's documentary Guerilla Art.

Benedict & Burnham Mfg. Co., 113 U.S. 59 (1885), was an American bill regarding alleged infringement on a patent issued to Edward A. Locke for specific improvements in identifying revenue marks. The defendants, Benedict & Burnham Manufacturing Company of Waterbury, were assignees of the patentee, and the plaintiff was the collector of internal revenue for the Second collection district of Connecticut.. The court ruled that, while the improvement was useful, it was not novel enough to be a patent. Background The patent was for a device that was designed specifically for sealing liquor casks with identifying marks or labels for tax purposes and for identifying the contents of the cask, and any other pertitent information. It was designed so that the marks and labels could not be fraudulently removed. There were two pieces, one to be retained by the government, the other meant to stay affixed to the cask. In 1875 new regulations in regard to the use of tax-paid stamps, by which a portion of the stamp is cut out at the time of dumping and returned with the gauger's report, was adopted. This method effectually destroys the stamp and prevents its reuse, while, at the same time, a sufficient mount of the engraving is shown upon the slip to determine whether the stamp is genuine. It was believed that this system afforded the government an effective means of protection against fraud in connection with the collection of distilled spirit taxes. Decision The court observed that while there was an increased utility beyond previous devices, there was no observable change in the character of the stamp, the identifying marks, nor the purpose of destroying the stamp while retaining the evidence of the stamp's purpose and \\"seems to us not to spring from that intuitive faculty of the mind put forth in the search for new results or new methods, creating what had not before existed, or bringing to light what lay hidden from vision; but, on the other hand, to be the suggestion of that common experience which arose spontaneously, and by a necessity of human reasoning, in the minds of those who had become acquainted with the circumstances with which they had to deal.\\" \\"Cutting out a portion of the stamp, as a means of defacing and mutilating it so as to prevent a second use, was matter of common knowledge and practice before the date of this patent; and cutting out a particular portion on which the identifying marks had been previously written or printed was simply cutting a stub from the stamp instead of cutting the stamp from the stub, as before.\\" The court mentioned a flaw in the system whereby frauds were committed by the \\"removal of tax-paid stamps from packages on which they had been originally placed by the officer to others surreptitiously substituted for them, or by emptying the packages of their original contents and fraudulently refilling them with spirits on which had not been paid, attracted the general attention of the revenue department, the answer to the problem of prevention was found by immediate inference from the existing regulations, in the adoption of the expedient now in question.\\" \\"As soon as the mischief became apparent, and the remedy was seriously and systematically studied by those competent to deal with the subject, the present regulation was promptly suggested and adopted; just as a skilled mechanic, witnessing the performance of a machine, inadequate by reason of some defect, to accomplish the object for which it had been designed, by the application of his common knowledge and experience perceives the reason of the failure and supplies what is obviously wanting. It is but the display of the expected skill of the calling, and involves only the exercise of the ordinary faculties of reasoning upon the materials supplied by a special knowledge, and the facility of manipulation which results from its habitual and intelligent practice; and is in no sense the creative work of that inventive faculty which it is the purpose of the constitution and the patent laws to encourage and reward. On this ground the decree of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to enter a decree dismissing the bill; and it is so ordered.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 113 References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:United States patent case law Category:1885 in United States case law Category:Revenue stamps Category:Waterbury, Connecticut ","title":"Hollister v.

Located approximately south west of the city of Trincomalee, the airport is also known as Trincomalee Airport and SLAF China Bay. Originally built by the British, it was transferred to the Royal Ceylonese Air Force which later became the Sri Lanka Air Force. History During the 1920s the British built an airfield in China Bay in eastern Ceylon. The Royal Air Force established an airfield called RAF Station China Bay in March 1942 with Hurricane, Spitfire and Catalina aircraft. A number of RAF squadrons (17, 159, 205, 240, 258, 261, 273, 321, 357, 648) and other units were stationed at the airfield during and immediately after the war. The airfield was bombed by the Japanese on 9 April 1942 during World War II. The airfield was upgraded to accommodate Boeing B-29 Superfortress over the first half of 1944. After these upgrades were complete it was used to stage the B-29 attack force for the unsuccessful Operation Boomerang raid on oil refineries at Palembang in August 1944. After independence, the British maintained two military airfields in Ceylon, the Royal Air Force station at RAF Katunayake and the Royal Navy base in Trincomalee, and camps at Diyatalawa. The naval base in Trincomalee included the airfield in China Bay. It was opened to civilian flights in 1952. All British military airfields/barracks and sites in the country were transferred and taken over by the Ceylonese government in November 1957. RAF China Bay became RCyAF China Bay. It became SLAF Base China Bay in May 1972. The base was turned into the Sri Lanka Air Force Academy in March 1976. The academy was made an air force base in January 1987 due to the civil war.

It is a tempera on panel and measures 49.5 cm tall and 58.5 cm wide. It is in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow, Scotland. Its date is not certain though a majority of the critics consider it early, noticing certain elements reminiscent of Verrocchio. Van Marle, however, dates it circa 1490. On the lower part there is a note that indicates that it came from the Florentine Church of Saint Barnabas. The atmosphere is achieved through the succession of columns and sections of flooring that serve to demonstrate the perspective. The solemn architecture overlooks the figures.

It is the oldest house in the hamlet, reflecting several different eras of architecture and regional history, and has been a Registered Historic Place since 1998. It was built by Andries DuBois, a descendant of the original family of Huguenot settlers of nearby New Paltz, who built the house and farmed the land near the Wallkill River around the present-day hamlet. It was believed for a long time that the original construction took place around the middle of the 18th century. But several features ‚Äî the gambrel roof, eyebrow windows, classically styled windows, full porch and alternation of brick and wood walls ‚Äî suggested a different period of origin, or at least substantial subsequent alterations. After the Historical Society of Shawangunk and Gardiner acquired the house in 1998, it applied for and received a $7,500 grant from the Preservation League of New York State in 2003 for a historic structure report. An examination of the structural lumber dated it, and at first the house's original construction, to 1769. However, that lumber, and an archeological examination of the surrounding soil, showed charcoal layers, evidence of a serious fire at the site. Further investigation showed that the fire destroyed most of the original house, but enough of the framing timbers remained in condition good enough to be reused for the beginning of the current building in 1814. The entrance, windows, porch and interior molding were added in 1845, all reflecting the influence of the then-popular Greek Revival style. Finally, in 1981 the current porch was rebuilt using earlier materials. The dig also found a variety of artifacts, including early 19th-century American coinage, a comb and a child's doll. Lithics included debitage and a quartz scraper, suggesting a Native American presence at the site prior to the construction of the house. The Historical Society is currently renovating the house, which had come to some disrepair, with the help of locally raised funds and a grant from the State Historic Preservation Office., retrieved October 13, 2007. It will be used as a local history museum.

However, occasionally member states negotiate certain opt-outs from legislation or treaties of the European Union, meaning they do not have to participate in certain policy areas. Currently, three states have such opt-outs: Denmark (four opt-outs), Republic of Ireland (two opt-outs) and Poland (one opt-out). The United Kingdom had various opt-outs before leaving the Union. This is distinct from the enhanced cooperation, a measure introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam, whereby a minimum of nine member states are allowed to co-operate within the structure of the European Union without involving other member states, after the European Commission and a qualified majority have approved the measure. It is further distinct from Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification and permanent acquis suspensions, whose lifting is conditional on meeting certain benchmarks by the affected member states. Current opt-outs As of 2020, three states have formal opt-outs from a total of five policy areas. =Schengen Agreement ‚Äì Ireland= The Schengen Agreement abolished border controls between member states. When the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 incorporated it into the EU treaties, Ireland and the United Kingdom (a member state at the time) received opt-outs from implementing the Schengen acquis as they were the only EU member states which had not signed the agreement. However, the protocol on the Schengen acquis specified that they could request to opt into participating in Schengen measures on a case-by-case basis if they wished, subject to unanimous approval of the other participating states. Ireland only joined the UK in adopting this opt-out to keep their border with Northern Ireland open via the Common Travel Area (CTA). Prior to the renewal of the CTA in 2011, when the British government was proposing that passports be required for Irish citizens to enter the UK, there were calls for Ireland to join the Schengen Area. However, in response to a question on the issue, Bertie Ahern, the then- incumbent Taoiseach, stated: \\"On the question of whether this is the end of the common travel area and should we join Schengen, the answer is 'no'.\\" The opt-out was criticised in the United Kingdom for hampering the country's capabilities in stopping transnational crime through the inability to access the Schengen Information System. The UK formally requested to participate in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis ‚Äì Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation ‚Äì in 1999, and this was approved by the Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000.Council Decision (2000/365/EC) of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis (OJ L 131, 1 June 2000, p. 43) The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.Council Decision (2004/926/EC) of 22 December 2004 on the putting into effect of parts of the Schengen acquis by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (OJ L 395, 31 December 2004, p. 70) In contrast, while Ireland initially submitted a request to participate in the Schengen acquis in 2002, which was approved by the Council of the European Union,Council Decision (2002/192/EC) of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis (OJ L 64, 7 March 2002 p. 20) that decision has not yet been put into effect.

The protocol on the Schengen acquis and protocol on Denmark of the Treaty of Amsterdam stipulate that Denmark, which had signed an accession protocol the Schengen Agreement, would continue to be bound by the provisions and would have the option to participate in future developments of the Schengen acquis, but would do so on an intergovernmental basis rather than under EU law for the provisions which fell under the Justice and Home Affairs pillar, from which Denmark obtained an opt-out. However, the protocol stipulates that if Denmark chooses not to implement future developments of the Schengen acquis, the EU and its member states \\"will consider appropriate measures to be taken\\".Article 4(2) in Protocol (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union In the negotiations for the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark obtained an option to convert its Area of freedom, security and justice (which had incorporated the former Justice and Home Affairs pillar) opt-out into a flexible opt-in modelled on the Irish and British opt-outs. The Protocol stipulates that if Denmark exercises this option, then it will be bound by the Schengen acquis under EU law rather than on an intergovernmental basis. In a referendum on 3 December 2015, 53.1% rejected exercising this option. =Economic and Monetary Union ‚Äì Denmark= All member states other than Denmark, have either adopted the euro or are legally bound to do so. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 included protocols on the UK (a member state at the time) and Denmark giving them opt- outs with the right to decide if and when they would join the euro. Denmark subsequently notified the Council of the European Communities of their decision to opt out of the euro, and this was included as part of the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement, a Decision of Council, reached following the Maastricht Treaty's initial rejection in a 1992 Danish referendum. The purpose of the agreement was to assist in its approval in a second referendum, which it did. The Danish decision to opt out was subsequently formalized in an amended protocol as part of the Lisbon Treaty. In 2000 the Danish electorate voted against joining the euro in a referendum by a margin of 53.2% to 46.8% on a turnout of 87.6%. In the UK, the Labour government of Tony Blair argued that the UK should join the euro, contingent on approval in a referendum, if five economic tests were met. However, the assessment of those tests in June 2003 concluded that not all were met. The policy of the 2010s coalition government, elected in 2010, was against introducing the euro prior to the 2015 general election.. The UK ultimately withdrew from the European Union in 2020, leaving Denmark as the only state with the opt-out. While the remaining states are all obliged to adopt the euro eventually by the terms of their accession treaties, since membership in the Exchange Rate Mechanism is a prerequisite for euro adoption, and joining ERM is voluntary, these states can ultimately control the timing of their adoption of the euro by deliberately not satisfying the ERM requirement. =Defence ‚Äì Denmark= The Edinburgh Agreement of 1992 included a guarantee to Denmark that they would not be obliged to join the Western European Union, which was responsible for defence. Additionally, the agreement stipulated that Denmark would not take part in discussions or be bound by decisions of the EU with defence implications. The Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 included a protocol which formalised this opt-out from the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). As a consequence, Denmark is excluded from foreign policy discussions with defence implications and does not participate in foreign missions with a defence component. =Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ‚Äì Poland= Although not a full opt- out, both Poland and former member state the United Kingdom secured a protocol which clarified how the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, a part of the Treaty of Lisbon, would interact with national law in their countries limiting the extent that European courts would be able to rule on issues related to the Charter if they are brought to courts in Poland or the UK. Poland's then ruling party, Law and Justice, mainly noted concerns that it might force Poland to grant homosexual couples the same kind of benefits which heterosexual couples enjoy, while the UK was worried that the Charter might be used to alter British labour law, especially as relates to allowing more strikes. The European Scrutiny Committee of the British House of Commons, including members of both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, cast doubts on the protocol's text, asserting that the clarification might not have been worded strongly and clearly enough to achieve the government's aims. The UK ultimately withdrew from the European Union in 2020, leaving Poland as the only state with the opt-out. After the Civic Platform won the 2007 parliamentary election in Poland, it announced that it would not opt out from the Charter, leaving the UK as the only state not to adopt it. However, Donald Tusk, the new Prime Minister and leader of the Civic Platform, later qualified that pledge, stating he would consider the risks before signing the Charter, and on 23 November 2007 he announced that he would not sign the Charter after all (despite the fact that both his party and their coalition partner, the Polish People's Party, were in favour of signing), stating that he wanted to honour the deals negotiated by the previous government and that he needed the support of Law and Justice to gain the two-thirds majority necessary to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon in the Parliament of Poland. Shortly after the signature of the treaty, the Polish Sejm passed a resolution which expressed its desire to be able to withdraw from the Protocol. Tusk later clarified that he may sign up to the Charter after successful ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon has taken place. However, after the treaty entered into force a spokesperson for the Polish President argued that the Charter already applied in Poland and thus it was not necessary to withdraw from the protocol. He also stated that the government was not actively attempting to withdraw from the protocol. Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Rados≈Çaw Sikorski, of Civic Platform, argued that the protocol only narrowly modified the charter's application in Poland, and that formally renouncing the opt-out would require a treaty amendment which would need to be ratified by all EU member states. In April 2012, Leszek Miller, leader of the Democratic Left Alliance, stated that he would sign the charter if he comes to power. According to Andrew Duff, British Member of the European Parliament, \\"A Polish constitutional mechanism has since been devised whereby Poland can decide to amend or to withdraw from the Protocol, and such a possibility remains under review.\\" Proposed Czech opt-out In 2009, Czech President V√°clav Klaus refused to complete ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon unless the Czech Republic was given an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights (as Poland and the United Kingdom had been with Protocol 30) fearing the Charter would allow the families of Germans who were expelled from territory in the modern-day Czech Republic after the Second World War to challenge the expulsion before the EU's courts, though legal experts have suggested that the laws under which the Germans were expelled, the Bene≈° decrees, did not fall under the jurisdiction of EU law. In October 2009, EU leaders agreed to amend the protocol to include the Czech Republic at the time of the next accession treaty. In September 2011, the Czech government formally submitted a request to the Council that the promised treaty revisions be made to extend the protocol to the Czech Republic, and a draft amendment to this effect was proposed by the European Council. However, the Czech Senate passed a resolution in October 2011 opposing their accession to the protocol. When Croatia's Treaty of Accession 2011 was signed in late 2011, the Czech protocol amendment was not included. In October 2012, the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee approved a report which recommended against the Czech Republic's accession to the Protocol. On 11 December 2012, a third draft of the European Parliament's committee report was published, and on 22 May 2013 the Parliament voted in favour of calling on the European Council \\"not to examine the proposed amendment of the Treaties\\". The Parliament did, however, give its consent in advance that a treaty revision to add the Czech Republic to Protocol 30 would not require a new convention. In January 2014, the new Czech Human Rights Minister Ji≈ô√≠ Dienstbier Jr. said that he would attempt to have his country's request for an opt-out withdrawn. This was confirmed on 20 February 2014 by the new Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who withdrew the request for an opt-out during a meeting with President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso shortly after his newly elected government won the confidence of Parliament. In May 2014, the Council of the European Union formally withdrew their recommendation to hold an Intergovernmental Conference of member states to consider the proposed amendments to the treaties. =Area of freedom, security and justice ‚Äì Denmark and Ireland= Denmark and Ireland have opt-outs from the area of freedom, security and justice. The United Kingdom also had an opt-out prior to its withdrawal from the European Union in 2020. Ireland has a flexible opt-out from legislation adopted in the area of freedom, security and justice, which includes all matters previously part of the pre-Amsterdam Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar.See Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (page 295 of the PDF) This allows it to opt in or out of legislation and legislative initiatives on a case-by-case basis, which it usually did, except on matters related to Schengen. The opt-out from the JHA policy area was originally obtained by Ireland and the United Kingdom in a protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997, and was retained by both with the Treaty of Lisbon. Under Protocol 36 of the Lisbon Treaty, the UK had the option to opt out of all the police and criminal justice legislation adopted prior to the treaty's entry into force which had not been subsequently amended. The decision to opt out had to be made at least six months prior to the aforementioned measures coming under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice on 1 December 2014. The UK informed the European Council of their decision to exercise their opt-out in July 2013, and as such the impacted legislation ceased to apply to the UK as of 1 December 2014. While the protocol only permitted the UK to either opt out from all the legislation or none of it, they subsequently opted back into some measures. In contrast, Denmark has a more rigid opt-out from the area of freedom, security and justice. While the Edinburgh Agreement of 1992 stipulated that \\"Denmark will participate fully in cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs\\", the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 included a protocol which exempt it, as a matter of EU law, from participating in these policy areas, which are instead conducted on an intergovernmental basis with Denmark. The exception is the Schengen visa rules. When a measure is adopted which builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark has six months to decide whether to implement it. If Denmark decides to implement the measure, it takes the force of an international agreement between Denmark and the Schengen states. A failure by Denmark to implement a Schengen measure could result in it being excluded from the Schengen Area. A number of other parallel intergovernmental agreements have been concluded between the EU and Denmark to extend to it EU Regulations adopted under the area of freedom, security and justice, which Denmark can't participate in directly due to its opt-out. These include the Brussels Convention and Dublin Convention. In the negotiations of the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark obtained an amendment to the protocol to give it the option to convert its opt-out into a flexible opt-in modelled on the Irish and British opt-outs. In a referendum on 3 December 2015, 53.1% rejected exercising of this option. Legal guarantees Several times an EU member state has faced domestic public opposition to the ratification of an EU treaty leading to its rejection in a referendum. To help address the concerns raised, the EU has offered to make a \\"legal guarantee\\" to the rejecting state. These guarantees did not purport to exempt the state from any treaty provisions, as an opt-out does. Instead they offered a clarification or interpretation of the provisions to allay fears of alternative interpretations. =Citizenship ‚Äì Denmark= As part of the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement, Denmark obtained a clarification on the nature of citizenship of the European Union which was proposed in the then yet-to-come- into-force Maastricht Treaty. The Agreement was in the form of a Decision of Council. The part of the agreement, which only applied to Denmark, relating to citizenship was as follows: The guarantee to Denmark on citizenship was never incorporated into the treaties, but the substance of this statement was subsequently added to the Amsterdam Treaty and applies to all member states. Article 2 states that: = Irish protocol on the Lisbon Treaty = Following the rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon by the Irish electorate in 2008, a number of guarantees (on security and defence, ethical issues and taxation) were given to the Irish in return for holding a second referendum. On the second attempt in 2009 the treaty was approved. Rather than repeat the ratification procedure, the guarantees were merely declarations with a promise to append them to the next treaty.Crosbie, Judith (12 May 2009) Ireland seeks sign-off on Lisbon treaty guarantees, European VoiceSmyth, Jamie (2 April 2009) MEP queries legal basis for Ireland's Lisbon guarantees, The Irish Times The member states ultimately decided not to sign the protocol alongside the Croatian accession treaty, but rather as a single document. A draft protocol to this effect was proposed by the European Council and adopted by the European Parliament in April 2012. An Intergovernmental Conference followed on 16 May, and the protocol was signed by all states of the European Union between that date and 13 June 2012. The protocol was planned to take effect from 1 July 2013, provided that all member states had ratified the agreement by then, but it only entered into force on 1 December 2014. Former opt- outs The Major ministry secured the United Kingdom an opt-out from the protocol on the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty before it was signed in 1992. The Blair ministry abolished this opt-out after coming to power in the 1997 general election as part of the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam. = Former proposals = Following the announcement by the government of the United Kingdom that it would hold a referendum on withdrawing from the European Union, an agreement was reached between it and the EU on renegotiated membership terms should the state vote to remain a member. In addition to a number of amendments to EU Regulations which would apply to all states, a legal guarantee would be granted to the UK that would explicitly exempt it from the treaty-stated symbolic goal of creating an \\"ever closer union\\" by deepening integration. This guarantee was included in a Decision by the European Council, with the promise that it would be incorporated into the treaties during their next revision. However, following the referendum, in which the UK voted to leave the EU, per the terms of the Decision the provisions lapsed.

She has written on social affairs and political issues for a range of blogs including Conservative Home and Conservative Way Forward. She is a regular news reviewer on the Ian Collins show Roundtable on LBC. Boosting Britain In 2012, after visiting a range of different businesses, she set up an online initiative named 'Boosting Britain' to encourage and promote new ideas and companies which were helping Britain. It covered infrastructure, defence industry, education as well as motivational factors. She has suggested more honorary titles for engineers would help to bolster their image and help with the skills shortage As of 2017, the website was unregistered and not connecting. Campaigning Since setting up Act Against Bullying, Burfitt-Dons has been outspoken on the ill-effects of tribalism in society as a speaker and writer. She has advocated that tribalism is on the increase and has been taking effect in all forms of modern society leading to social unrest. Feeling the need to express what the public was confiding in her she designed a range of campaigns to promote human dignity and individuality in modern society. She designed the \\"Cool to Be Kind\\" Campaign in 2000; two years later she founded the National Decency Campaign in 2002. and, in 2006, the \\"Grade Not Degrade\\" campaign. The Scotsman quoted her as suggesting Celebrity Big Brother was legitimising the growing trend of bullying behaviour in classrooms around the country. She spoke at the Conservative Women's Organisation Forum at the House of Commons on cyber bullying claiming that today \\"children have to be as savvy as celebrities but without the pr support\\". In response to the growing trend of internet abuse she designed the CyberKind Campaign, which was launched on Remembrance Day (11 November) 2009. Burfitt-Dons founded the UK Kindness Movement and co-founder of Kindness Day UK. She appeared on BBC Breakfast on the first Kindness Day UK on 13 November 2010 alongside Kathy Lette who claimed that English people were condescending and unfriendly. In 2007 she began campaigning on global warming and has said that \\"climate change may be the ultimate issue that unites us all\\". Awards In 2006 she was nominated as an Angel Hero for The My Hero Project. In May 2009 she was invited to become a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in recognition of her work with children as well as to acknowledge her efforts as a campaigner and speaker on humanitarian and environmental issues. Global warming Burfitt-Dons co-founded the Global Warming Alliance which was set up in January 2006 to find solutions to the crisis. On 2 December 2008, she launched the Global Warming Hotspot channel on YouTube. She spearheaded the international Hot Women Campaign, which encouraged women to become more active in climate change issues and reduce carbon emissions and significantly raised awareness of the differences between male and female thinking on the issues. The Scotsman quoted Burfitt-Dons' claims that \\"the relentless rise in CO2 emissions is incrementally raising planetary temperatures, increasing water vapour in the atmosphere with a commensurate rise in rainfall, and ever stronger wind patterns randomly occurring across the globe.\\" Feminism Burfitt-Dons got involved with women's issues because of her charity work as a motivational speaker and mentor. In October 2009 she was part of the freshers feminist debate at Cambridge University with Cosmopolitan Magazine editor Louise Court and Edwina Currie. Burfitt-Dons set up the Royal Society of Arts' Women's Speakers' Network whose mission is to \\"raise women's profile in society by greater involvement in public speaking\\". She chaired the launch event at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on 9 November 2010 in a public debate entitled \\"The Great Female Debate: Do Women Speak Too much or too little?\\" She believes that some feminist groups have hijacked and radicalised the equality movement and has catalysed a debate around feminism calling on more gender realism via her blog The Common Sense Feminist. Her work on feminism includes the book Moderating Feminism:The Past The Now and What Comes Next (2016). Politics In September 2014 she was selected to fight the 2015 General Election for the Conservative Party in Nottingham North. She clashed with the incumbent MP Graham Allen over his criticism of small businesses in Nottingham North She has challenged Nottingham City Council over its Workplace Parking Levy policy as \`short term thinking' at its worse and suggested it was a political decision rather than an economic one.

This is perhaps the second earliest linga associated with Shiva discovered so far,Rao, 63-64. Much older phalluses in clay etc are known (See Ellgood, 46). and it has been dated to the 2nd/1st century BC,Harle, 271; Blurton, 78; Elgood, 47 says from end BC to 1st AD or the 3rd century BC, or much later, to the 2nd century AD, 3-4th century AD, or even, according to one source, as late as the 7th century AD. This is \\"the only sculpture of any importance\\" to survive from ancient South India before sculpture made under the Pallava dynasty from the 7th century AD onwards, and \\"its mysteriousness lies in the total absence so far of any object in an even remotely similar manner within many hundreds of miles, and indeed anywhere in South India\\".Harle, 271 If assigned an early date, the figure on the linga is \\"one of the earliest surviving and unequivocal images of the god Shiva\\".Blurton, 82 The temple is later than the linga; again, estimates of the date of the temple vary considerably, but it is usually dated to \\"the later Chola and Vijayanagara periods\\", so possibly a thousand years later than the sculpture. The linga was originally sited in the open air, with the rectangular stone surround that still remains.Blurton, 78-81 (78 quoted) The temple remains in worship, but has been protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) since 1954. Description and context The linga was, by his own account, discovered by the ASI archaeologist T. A. Gopinatha Rao, \\"some years\\" before he published it in 1916. The linga is carved out of a hard dark brown local stone. It is over 5 ft high and slightly above a foot in diameter on the main shaft. The glans penis is clearly differentiated from the shaft by being wider, with a deep slanting groove cut about a foot from the top of the Linga.Rao, 65-67; he gives the height as 5 foot exactly, but did not see the full length. Unusually, the garbhagriha is semi-circular, curving behind the linga. An image of Shiva in sthanaka posture is carved in high relief. On the front portion of the linga the God is standing on the shoulders of the apasmarapurusha or a dwarf.Rao, 65-67 The figure of Shiva resembles a vigorous hunter; He holds a ram or antelope in his right hand and a small water pot in his left hand.Rao, 66 calls it a ram, Blurton, 78 also suggests an antelope. Other sources mention a goat. There is a battle axe (Parasu) resting on his left shoulder. He wears a number of heavy earrings in his ears, an elaborate flat necklace, and a girdle with a dangling central portion. His arms are adorned with five bracelets, with different designs in relief, on each wrist, and a high arm-ring on each side. He wears a dhoti of very thin material, fastened at his waist with a vastra-mekhala.Rao, 67 This extends round the whole shaft of the linga. He has no yagnopavita or sacred thread. Emerging from a complicated turban-like head-covering, his hair is long and plaited (not matted).Rao, 66-67 His features are described by Rao as Mongoloid,Rao, 66 and Blurton describes the figure as not having \\"the features associated with gods of orthodox Hinduism\\" but \\"squat and broadly-built, and with the thick curly hair and the pronounced lips still seen amongst tribal populations in Central India\\", suggesting the non-Vedic aspects being absorbed into the emerging figure of Shiva.Blurton, 81; Elgood, 47 \\"with full lips and thick, curly hair\\". Rao's account emphasizes that the linga here is unmistakably a representation of an erect human penis, as therefore are other Shiva lingas,Rao, 68-69 this point having apparently been disputed, or over- generalized,Elgood, 46 by some previously. He describes it as \\"shaped exactly like the original model, in a state of erection\\",Rao, 68 though one of his illustrations shows the \\"plan\\" section of the shaft, with seven straight-line faces, and gives their unequal lengths. The sharpest angle made by these faces would run through the centre of the Shiva figure, and the front face of the linga is made of the two longest faces (at 6 inches). Two side faces of 4 inches are at right angles to the figure, and the rear of the shaft has one central longer face at right angles to the sides, and two shorter ones joining the back and sides.Rao, \\"Plate II (to face page 66)\\" Gudimallam statue details Though the linga has remained in worship in the temple built around it, its relationship to the sanctuary and setting has been altered since Rao's time. The photograph in Rao's 1916 book,Rao, Plate II, after p. 66 like the one at the top of the article, shows the linga set into the floor, which comes at about the level of the dwarf's midriff. More recent photos and videos, presumably taken after an ASI exploration in 1973-74,ASI \\"Since Independence ‚Äì Andhra Pradesh\\" show the lingam in a square stone enclosure on the floor, with the whole length of the dwarf (who is kneeling) visible, as well as a circular pediment.Harle, 271 and Arundhati, 41, for examples The stone slabs making the enclosure are plain on the outside, but carved on the inside as stone railings (with three horizontal rails) in a pattern comparable to those of ancient Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi (but much smaller).Blurton, 81 Rao was unaware of this structure, then below the floor, saying \\"the pedestal is cut out in the form of a quadrangular ridge on the ground\\", this ridge in fact being the top of the uppermost rail of the railings. Whether the rest of the floor was lowered or the linga and railings raised is unclear; the sanctuary floor is now a few steps below the main floor level of the temple, an unusual feature which Rao's account does not mention. The linga also has a modern golden metal frame, topped by a naga head, behind it.Hidden Temples.com, \\"Gudimallam Temple Abhishekam\\", showing the linga in worship. Gudimallam Temple Sources disagree about the expression and connotations of the \\"dwarf\\" below Shiva. To Rao he is \\"jolly and happy, as is evidenced by the broad grin on his face\\". He has \\"pointed animal ears\\". For Elgood, he is a \\"yaksha with fish-shaped feet and conch-shaped ears\\", so a spirit connected with water, matching the water pot held by Shiva (Rao would never have seen these feet).Elgood, 47 Shiva conventionally stands on such a figure in much later depictions of him as Nataraja (\\"Lord of the Dance\\"), where the figure is usually said to represent \\"ignorance\\",Elgood, 49; Shiva as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja), Chola period, c. 10th/11th century The Art Institute of Chicago, United States but in the earliest Indian stone monumental sculpture, figures often stand on dwarfish figures, as with (for example) the Bhutesvara Yakshis (Buddhist, 2nd century AD), where these figures also seem rather cheerful. Karthikeya Sharma, who conducted the ASI excavations, states that the Gudimallam Linga combines several later aspects of Siva; for example, the God's eyes focusing on the tip of his nose indicates the Virupaksha and Yoga-Dakshinamurthy aspects of later years. The holding of a ram in his right hand indicates the Bhikshatanamurthi aspect of Siva. History of the temple and site Gudimallam Temple entrance The name of the temple is mentioned as Parasurameswara Temple in the inscriptions. These inscriptions do not refer to the original builders of the temple. But they register the gifts made to the temple like land, money and cows for the conduct of daily worship in the temple. Black and Redware sherds of the 2nd or 3rd century AD have been brought to light during the course of excavations conducted in 1973. Potsherds of the Andhra Satavahana period (Circa 1st century AD to 2nd century AD) and large sized bricks measuring 42x21x6 inches of the same period have also been found. Hence some historians assign the temple to the Satavahana period. Videos of the temple show a number of medieval sculptures in position. Historians disagree about the political history and the name of this place. There are several inscriptions which date to the Pallava, Yadava Devarayalu, Ganga Pallava, Bana and Chola periods on the walls of the shrine and on stone slabs in the temple courtyard. The earliest inscription belongs to the reign of Nandivarma Pallava (802 AD). All the inscriptions mention the keen interest taken by the donors and their gifts to the Temple. However, none of the inscriptions give the village name as Gudimallam. These two names however are not mentioned in the inscriptions. The village is referred as Viprapita (Brahmana Agrahara). Comparisons for the lingam Gudimallam lingam: front, rear & side elevations, with sectional plan. Some of the copper coins obtained at Ujjain and belonging to the 3rd century BC contain figures which resemble the Linga of Gudimallam. A 1st century sculpture in the Mathura Museum also contains a figure resembling the Gudimallam Shiva. J.N. Benerjee in his work Religion in art and archaeology observes: > The Lingam in Arghya motif was comparatively late phase. In the course of > its conventionalisation and development, the Arghya was supposed to > symbolise the female part and it was described, in many late texts of a > tantric character. But originally in comparatively early times, the emblems > of the male and the female deities were worshiped separately, as the > earliest specimens of the Phallus and ring stone testify. The Gudimallam > Shiva Linga or for that matter the Shivalingas of the Pre-Gupta and the > early Gupta periods did not show any real base in the shape of the latter > characterization of the arghya or pita. Even in latter representations of > the emblem, the projecting section of the Pita really served the very useful > purpose of draining off the water profusely poured on the top of the Shiva > Linga to some distance from its base. This statement needs revision, for it > is evident from the recent excavations conducted by the Archaeological > Survey of India, South eastern Circle of Hyderabad, clearly revealed that > Gudimallam Linga was originally provided with a pedestal.

Designed by Ken Shuttleworth of Make Architects, it contains 135 flats, of offices, shops, a hotel and a 'skyline' restaurant. It is the final phase of The Mailbox development. The site is enclosed by The Mailbox complex, Commercial Street, Washington Wharf apartment complex and the Worcester & Birmingham Canal.  History  The Cube under construction, February 2009 = Planning history = As the final stage of The Mailbox development, Birmingham Development Company Ltd. decided to organise a design competition for a building on the site. The winning design was submitted by Birmingham-born architect Ken Shuttleworth of Make Architects. Plans for The Cube were first submitted to Birmingham City Council's Planning Department on 31 August 2005 for outline planning permission. A six-week public consultation stage was implemented immediately, and the planning application received outline planning permission from the Planning Committee on 7 February 2006. On 17 May 2006, a reserved matters planning application was submitted to Birmingham City Council, the submission of reserved matters for design, external appearance and landscaping relating to the erection of two buildings. One in the form of a cube incorporating a mix of uses to include car parking, retail, restaurant, office, residential, boutique hotel and skyline restaurant, and one plant building in accordance with the application. Full planning permission was granted by the Planning Committee on 7 August 2006. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in 2008, but has been delayed. Construction company, Taylor Woodrow had won the project from Sir Robert McAlpine and Miller Construction, but had been unable to agree a final price, with the developer, BDC. Due to other contractors being deterred by the complexity of the design, BDC decided to establish their own subsidiary contractor, BuildAbility. This led Building magazine to dub the project 'Britain's biggest DIY job'. Employees of Build Ability are being offered a 60% share of the profits of The Cube as an incentive to encourage recruitment. = Construction = Preparation for construction commenced in 2007 with the clearance of all structures on site and reconfiguration of a pedestrian bridge towards The Mailbox. Bachy Soletanche Limited (BSL), led by Project Manager Oliver Cooper, then set to work creating a perimeter retaining wall around the site to prevent ground movement whilst the foundations were being constructed. A large diameter auger piling technique was used to install 226, diameter piles at spacings and to depths of . BSL skipped three piles ‚Äì after installing the first pile ‚Äì to avoid concrete flowing into the next borehole and therefore damaging the original pile. Due to the presence of groundwater when the piles were bored, a Tremie pipe was used which displaced water to the surface as the bore hole was filled with concrete. At the southwest corner of the site, where the automated car stacking system was to be installed, BSL removed the large diameter auger piles and replaced them with 24Nr, diameter minipiles bored to a depth of . Along the western boundary of the site, a further 54 minipiles were installed to a depth of to provide further support Washington Wharf, an adjacent apartment building. BSL then constructed 30 king post piles to provide the foundation for a temporary ramp which was required for future building works. Each king post pile was formed in a diameter pile, with a square steel column concreted into the toe of the pile. These piles ran in two parallel rows down the centre of the site from Commercial Street. The Cube by night With all the initial piling works complete, excavation commenced on site by local firm O'Donnell, who had to test various ramp gradients at one of their sites before starting work at the Cube. The optimum gradient for lorries transporting earth from a hill start was recreated at the site, with the surface of the temporary ramp up to Commercial Street being maintained in a coarse condition to give sufficient grip for vehicles entering and leaving the site. A total of of earth and sandstone was removed from the site. Once this had been completed, BSL returned to construct 12 temporary anchors to hold back the retaining piles on the east side of the site. BSL completed the piling project at the end of 2007. BuildAbility then subcontracted work for the construction of the concrete shell to O'Donnell, who assembled two tower cranes at either end of the site. O'Donnell used a formwork construction technique in partnership with PERI Ltd. to construct the cores, columns and basement walls. A rail climbing system was installed, which provided a scaffolding cage around the workforce during building. Lifting platforms were used to reduce the space occupied by scaffolding. An aluminium fast slab formwork system named Skydeck was used to construct the floorplates. BuildAbility decided to use unbonded post-tensioned concrete, an uncommon system in the UK, for the floorplates as this allowed them to be thinner and reduced construction time. Once the concrete shell had been constructed, work commenced on the construction of the two-storey steel crown which allowed for the installation of the complex glazing system. Formed with box sections in the larger northern tips and UC sections in the southern tips, the wings were delivered to site in pieces no heavier than 7t due to the tower crane's weight limitations. The wings were then welded on site using high-precision welding. The remainder of the structure consists of a composite design with columns of exposed circular hollow sections (CHS), working as an architectural feature. Heavier deep plate girders were installed in the centre of the crown to support the window cleaning machine. The main body of steelwork for the crown was completed in December 2009, with secondary steelwork onto which the cladding was attached being installed later on. The Cube from the canal J T Hawkes (Electrical Contractors) who partnered with Robert Prettie and Co were awarded a ¬£28 million contract for HVAC, mechanical & electrical engineering works at the scheme and they subsequently contracted Hattersley to install HVAC Compact Hook-Up units. The units provide flow control, flow measurement, system and coil flushing and isolation capabilities from a single compact and lightweight unit. Built from bronze and DZR brass they can be used for chilled and heating water systems from ‚Äì10¬∞C to 120¬∞C. German cladding manufacturer HAGA won the ¬£11 million contract to design, manufacture and install the distinctive cladding, with BDC giving the firm ¬£1 million up-front when the contract was awarded. HAGA contracted Polypipe Ventilation to manufacture over 200 ventilation units which were transported to HAGA's factory in Germany and installed into the cladding for the fretwork. Additionally, HAGA contracted Wicona to assist with the manufacture of the cladding panels, making it the largest project in the UK for the company. Starting in early 2010, W√∂hr Parking Systems installed an automatic car parking system for 339 in the three basement floors of the building. Cars access the car park by entering through Building B and entering one of the four lift-garages. The installation is the largest of its kind in the UK. The fit-out process for the office space for the Highways Agency by JD Interiors incorporating J T Hawkes (electrical contractors) and Robert Prettie took 35 weeks to complete. Facilities provided include toilet blocks, shower rooms, kitchen areas, first aid areas and prayer rooms. The reception area was fitted out with oak panelling to the ceilings and walls, and glass feature walls and reception desk. The Highways Agency moved their Broadway offices at Five Ways to The Cube in May 2010. = Financial issues = To fund the construction of The Cube, Birmingham Development Company approached Lloyds TSB, who had funded the company's previous, successful development The Mailbox. Lloyds TSB agreed to fund the development as the sole debt collector and provided a ¬£87 million speculative loan that was to be issued in stages in accordance with the various phases of the project. However, against the backdrop of a challenging property market, on 26 March 2010 the Lloyds Banking Group called in PricewaterhouseCoopers as administrators to BDC and BuildAbility, after a failure to agree further funding for the project. It was rumoured that the additional funding was requested by BDC due to a budget overrun as a result of the complex design and construction methods. PricewaterhouseCoopers began by gathering together the main sub-contractors on site and agreeing to complete the project, which was already 80% complete, with new funding being secured from Lloyds TSB.  Architecture  The cubic dimensions of the main design element lends to the name of the development. However, the building consists of three stages with the cube being one of them. The building is constructed of concrete, with two fire-fighting cores rising up either side of the building. Birmingham-born Ken Shuttleworth, who designed London's Gherkin building with Norman Foster, has stated that the design evokes the city's industrial heritage. = Base = Front of The Cube At ground level there is a fully glazed base that is two storeys tall at the canal elevation and one storey in height at the Commercial Street elevation, to the gradients across the site. The base houses two out of the four retail levels, with the ground floor also accommodating public toilets and a Health Club and Spa operated by Hotel Indigo above, which will be discretely accessed by the main hotel lifts. The floor below the canal towpath level will be a courtyard area with a ¬£250,000 public art piece created by Wolverhampton-born graffiti artist Temper. Rising up through the building from the courtyard is a six-sided, twisting atrium that allows rain to fall into the courtyard area with shelter being provided by walkways on the upper levels and canopies. Access to the floors above is provided by escalators. = Cube = Sitting on top of the base, is a perfect cube element measuring in height, width and breadth. The cube consists of 16 floors, with retail distributed on the lower two storeys, office space on the above five floors, residential apartments on the above nine levels, with the top floor of the cube being shared with Hotel Indigo. The Cube residential apartments are separated into East and West Wing. East Wing is strictly limited to owner occupiers, according to contract it is not allowed to let. West Wing is buy- to-let, owner may occupy the flats or let to tenants. East and West Wings have connections on each floor inside the building, but locked fire doors prevent access to different wings. The floor to floor height of the retail floors will be , whilst this is reduced to on the office floors and further reduced to on the residential and hotel floors. Canal-side elevation showing opening at residential level, and the crown. The exterior of the cube is being clad in glazed and gold colour anodised aluminium panels with structural silicone bonding to the mullions. There are a total of over 2,100 panels used, with the aluminium panels projecting from the glazing. The cladding units were manufactured in lengths of and , depending on the floor to floor heights. Each panel was designed on a geometric module, maintaining the illusion that each floor was of an equal height. Insulation was added behind the metal boxes in the cladding units. The atrium rising through the cube meant that cladding is needed on the interior. This will be composed of polyester powder coated aluminium mullions and transoms incorporating double glazed units, as well as polyester powder coated aluminium panels with an outer glazed panel and a ceramic frit application, which will create a consistent glossy appearance throughout the atrium. These will be bonded with structural silicone. At the point where residential levels start, the atrium expands out and creates an opening in the canal elevation of the cube's facade. The opening will hold a large fretwork of various shapes of various sizes, constructed out of steel box sections. These were then covered with a cladding system consistent with that used along the exterior. Along the top of the fretwork will be a fabricated truss section, composed of four pieces, that will provide lateral stability in the fretwork. The Cube offers concierge service to East Wing residents only. The concierge, takes care of parcel arrival, providing useful information for residents and present 24 hours. The residents in West Wing is strictly restricted to use concierge service offered by the Cube, even though a concierge desk is present at the entrance of West Wing but never taken in operation as concierge service. = Crown = View from restaurant on level 25, looking north-west The third element is the two storey crown that sits on top of the cube element. It is two storeys in height and will house facilities for the boutique hotel and a rooftop restaurant with skybar, offering panoramic views of the city centre. Unlike the rest of the Cube, the crown is constructed from a steel frame due to the complexity of the glazing. Four of the corners overhang the edge of the cube element, creating an angular form. The restaurant was designed by Conran & Partners and was to be operated by D&D; London, in their first venture outside London, but they later pulled out. The new restaurant called \\"Steakhouse Bar and Grill\\" by Marco Pierre White opened in December 2011. It takes up the entire top floor of the scheme as part of a ¬£10 million investment by Sanguine Hospitality Limited. = Building B = Building B is the name for the entrance block to the car parking garage, which uses an automated car stacking system. The brick building houses plant on the roof, hidden from view by a brick parapet. Access to the building is via steel rolling shutters on Commercial Street.

The program was broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network (AFRS) and transmitted by shortwave to the troops overseas‚Äîwith few exceptions, it was not broadcast over domestic U.S. radio stations. Background Most episodes of the program were produced before an audience in the Vine Street Playhouse in Hollywood, California, and recorded via electrical transcription. The weekly listening audience of was estimated at 95.5 million. Troops sent in requests for a particular performer or program to appear, and they also suggested unusual ideas for music, sketches, or sounds from home on the program, such as: \\"Ann Miller tap dancing in military boots\\"; \\"a sigh from Carole Landis\\" or Lucille Ball; \\"foghorns on San Francisco Bay\\"; \\"Errol Flynn taking a shower\\"; \\"a slot machine delivering the jackpot\\" and \\"Bing Crosby mixing a bourbon and soda for Bob Hope\\". Top performers of the day appeared, including Bing Crosby, Jack Benny, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland and The Andrews Sisters. The first Command Performance was broadcast on March 1, 1942, almost exactly three months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It was produced under the aegis of the Office of War Information and its success paved the way for the creation of the Armed Forces Radio Service in May 1942. Time magazine described Command Performance as being, \\"the best wartime program in America\\". However very few listeners in the United States ever heard it and it would appear that the Christmas Eve Command Performance of 1942 was the only program of the series to be broadcast to a general audience. Variety magazine commented on this saying: > The War Department on Christmas Eve gave domestic listeners their first > taste of a series that had been going out to the Armed Forces on short-wave > for 43 consecutive weeks. The purpose of the special occasion as Elmer > Davis, Office of War Information chief, expressed it in a foreword to the > show, was to forge a link between the servicemen abroad and the folks on the > Home Front. A recorded version of the show was short-waved, all over the > world, the next day... Hope emceed, tossed off a monologue and cross-fired > with Crosby. A special treat in the vocal department was the version of > \\"Basin Street Blues\\" that came out of the tonsil partnership of Bing Crosby > and The Charioteers.\\" Variety also observed that ‚Äúsometimes the language on these shows is just a little more robust than is passed by standard broadcasting stations. Jack Benny, as we recall, last Sunday night encouraged our fighting men to ‚Äògive ‚Äôem hell.'‚Äù Transcription disc label for broadcast number 175 (May 17, 1945) of Command Performance, featuring Orson Welles At the outset, the AFRS was shortwaving the shows but the reception was often distorted or spoiled by fading and static. Also, many servicemen had no access to a shortwave receiver. These problems were resolved when the Armed Forces Radio Service sought permission from the four major radio networks to record favorite programs on 16\\" transcription discs. As many as 70 of these programs were recorded and produced each week, especially for the armed forces, together with Command Performance, Mail Call, G.I. Journal, and various other series. At the peak of the war around 21,000 transcriptions were being shipped to troops in Europe, Asia, and the South Pacific and over 800 radio stations, operated by and for servicemen, were set up to cover all theaters of war. Performers volunteered their talents for the program. An article in a 1943 issue of Tune In magazine estimated if \\"Presented by a commercial sponsor, Command Performance would have a weekly talent cost of $50,000.\\" In addition, performing and production unions waived their rules for the war effort on the condition that the shows were only broadcast to service personnel. The final episode of Command Performance‚Äîthe 415th in the series‚Äîwas produced in December 1949. The program was one of nine AFRS shows that were ended as a result of a budget cut by the Secretary of Defense. Dick Tracy in B Flat One memorable program, No. 162, a 55-minute musical adaptation of Dick Tracy, was broadcast on February 15, 1945. Bing Crosby had the title role in Dick Tracy in B Flat with Dinah Shore as Tess Truheart and Jimmy Durante as The Mole. The supporting cast included Judy Garland, Cass Daley, Frank Sinatra, Frank Morgan, Bob Hope, Harry von Zell, Jerry Colonna, Lou Crosby, the Andrews Sisters and the Joe Lilley Chorus. The show managed to do what Tracy's creator, cartoonist Chester Gould, had never done - marry Tracy to Tess. The act opened with a Tracy - Tess wedding scene and song - ‚ÄúOh Happy, Happy, Happy Wedding Day‚Äù which faded into the sound of an auto, the squeal of tyres, a machine gun burst and three pistol shots. Subsequent wedding scenes were interrupted by a bank robbery, a kidnapping and a hold-up with 13 people killed. \\"Most of the songs were clever parodies and the entire show was one big laugh from beginning to end.\\" The program generally ran for 30 minutes outside of holiday and other specials. Spinoff A spinoff series, Request Performance, aired on CBS in 1945‚Äì46. Revival In 2009, the Pentagon Channel revived the show with some of today's newest acts.

History  The Intermountain Indian School was originally the Bushnell Army Hospital, which was open from 1942 to 1946 and served wounded soldiers of World War II. The land was donated by the city to the Federal government so Brigham City could get the hospital. Doctors, nurses, military personnel, wounded patients, and their families arrived in Brigham City to work at Bushnell. After the hospital's closure, the buildings sat empty for a short period while the city decided what should be done with the land. The last patient was discharged 22 June 1946. At its peak, the hospital was a community of some 6,000 inhabitants, including patients, assigned military personnel, and civilian employees. The first patient was admitted on 10 October 1942.Staff, \\"S. B. Soldier Last Patient At Bushnell Hospital, Utah - Combat Wounded Veteran Holds Distinction As Final Man at Once Busy Institution\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 23 June 1946, Volume 52, page 15. In 1948, Brigham City got a proposal for an Indian school. The estimate for remodeling, new construction, and equipment was $3.75 million. President Harry Truman signed the bill allocating the money in May 1949. The superintendent and a few assistants began working on June 4, 1949, and by January 1950, 542 students were accepted at the federally run Intermountain Indian School. Since that time, the school was authorized to enroll 2,150 students. The school served Navajo children who were bused from Arizona and were taught from elementary to high school, and had its own medical facility and printing press. In 1954, 24 students graduated from the school, and by 1955 that number jumped to 188. By 1981, 5,319 students had graduated. Despite its success as a Navajo boarding school, enrollment was down in the early 70s, so the school was changed to the Intermountain Inter-Tribal School for the 1974-1975 school year. It grew to having students from nearly 100 tribes. The school closed in 1984, after which city officials submitted a master plan in Washington, D.C. to get the along U.S. Route 91 back from the federal government. The agreement reached was that the land would remain open space and not be used for anything other than recreation, and it was deeded back to the city.  The school today  The letter I representing the school is still visible on the mountainside. Brigham City turned the open land into a golf course and sold the rest to fund the golf course. Objects from the buildings were sold for $100,000, and property was sold for $2.5 million. The dormitories have been turned into townhouses called \\"Eagle Village\\". A furniture store, a consulting firm, a martial arts company, and various churches all house their businesses in the former home of the Intermountain Indian School. For several decades many of the buildings stood vacant, but in early 2013 these buildings were demolished to make way for an extension of the Brigham City campus of Utah State University. For the past 20 years, former students of Intermountain have held an annual reunion the third week of July at Wheatfields Lake near Navajo, New Mexico.  Urban legends  Until recently the school was left largely deserted. This allowed local delinquents to break windows and enter to paint graffiti. Entering these buildings is done as a sort of dare. There are several urban legends concerning the buildings. The most popular are that the buildings are haunted, or that tunnels built during World War II connecting the buildings underneath are used for satanic blood filled rituals. The School property and buildings were originally the Bushnell Army Hospital, designed specifically to treat amputees during World War II. The buildings were all connected by ramp ways for wheelchair access, including ramps between the first and second floors. Both steam heating pipes and electrical power lines ran under the ramps. The students used to speculate that during the war, they threw all the amputated limbs under the ramps. During the war the grounds were meticulously kept by German POWs. In the late 1970s and early 1980s numbers of former POWs returned to show their children and grandchildren where they spent the war. The original School classroom buildings and the school auditorium have been torn down.

A memorial cairn marks the site of the mission adjacent to the cemetery on the south side of the Kaeo River. =Flooding= Kaeo is built on the flood plain of the Kaeo River and has experienced destructive flooding. It came to national attention in 2007 when it took the brunt of three major floods within the space of a few months - in February, March and July. Water flooded homes and shops and destroyed the primary school's pool complex. The local rugby clubrooms also suffered, and the club received support from the whole country as it raised funds to lift the clubrooms off the ground to minimise the risk of damage from further flooding. Landslips, fallen power lines, and road closures resulted from heavy rain in February 2008. The Northland Regional Council scheduled flood-protection work for 2008, but as of 2011 it was still waiting on various consents.

He was of Khitan ethnicity.  Career  In 696, the Khitan rose against Chinese hegemony under the leadership of Li Jinzhong and his brother-in-law Sun Wanrong. At the time, Li Kaigu was a general under Li Jinzhong. By 697 Li Jinzhong had died and Sun had been defeated and killed. Li Kaigu and fellow Khitan general Luo Wuzheng (Èß±ÂãôÊï¥) surrendered to Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty. Initially, Zhou generals wanted to put Li Kaigu and Luo Wuzheng to death in retaliation for their victories over Zhou forces, but the chancellor Di Renjie intervened and persuaded Wu Zetian to make them her generals. Li Kaigu was subsequently able to suppress the remaining Khitan forces. In 700, Li Kaigu was named Duke of Yan and subsequently took the surname \\"Wu\\". (Presumably, he changed his surname back to \\"Li\\" after Wu Zetian's son, Emperor Zhongzong of the Tang Dynasty, returned to the throne in 705 following a coup that restored the Dynasty).

LINQ extends the language by the addition of query expressions, which are akin to SQL statements, and can be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays, enumerable classes, XML documents, relational databases, and third-party data sources. Other uses, which utilize query expressions as a general framework for readably composing arbitrary computations, include the construction of event handlers or monadic parsers. It also defines a set of method names (called standard query operators, or standard sequence operators), along with translation rules used by the compiler to translate query syntax expressions into expressions using fluent-style (called method syntax by Microsoft) with these method names, lambda expressions and anonymous types. Many of the concepts that LINQ introduced were originally tested in Microsoft's Cœâ research project. Ports of LINQ exist for PHP (PHPLinq), JavaScript (linq.js), TypeScript (linq.ts), and ActionScript (ActionLinq), although none are strictly equivalent to LINQ in the .NET inspired languages C#, F# and VB.NET (where it is a part of the language, not an external library, and where it often addresses a wider range of needs). Architecture of LINQ in the .NET Framework =Standard Query Operator API= In what follows, the descriptions of the operators are based on the application of working with collections. Many of the operators take other functions as arguments. These functions may be supplied in the form of a named method or anonymous function. The set of query operators defined by LINQ is exposed to the user as the Standard Query Operator (SQO) API. The query operators supported by the API are: ;Select: The Select operator performs a projection on the collection to select interesting aspects of the elements. The user supplies an arbitrary function, in the form of a named or lambda expression, which projects the data members. The function is passed to the operator as a delegate. ;Where: The Where operator allows the definition of a set of predicate rules that are evaluated for each object in the collection, while objects that do not match the rule are filtered away. The predicate is supplied to the operator as a delegate. ;SelectMany: For a user-provided mapping from collection elements to collections, semantically two steps are performed. First, every element is mapped to its corresponding collection. Second, the result of the first step is flattened by one level. Note: Select and Where are both implementable in terms of SelectMany, as long as singleton and empty collections are available. The translation rules mentioned above still make it mandatory for a LINQ provider to provide the other two operators. ;Sum / Min / Max / Average: These operators optionally take a function that retrieves a certain numeric value from each element in the collection and uses it to find the sum, minimum, maximum or average values of all the elements in the collection, respectively. Overloaded versions take no function and act as if the identity is given as the lambda. ;Aggregate: A generalized Sum / Min / Max. This operator takes a function that specifies how two values are combined to form an intermediate or the final result. Optionally, a starting value can be supplied, enabling the result type of the aggregation to be arbitrary. Furthermore, a finalization function, taking the aggregation result to yet another value, can be supplied. ;Join / GroupJoin: The Join operator performs an inner join on two collections, based on matching keys for objects in each collection. It takes two functions as delegates, one for each collection, that it executes on each object in the collection to extract the key from the object. It also takes another delegate in which the user specifies which data elements, from the two matched elements, should be used to create the resultant object. The GroupJoin operator performs a group join. Like the Select operator, the results of a join are instantiations of a different class, with all the data members of both the types of the source objects, or a subset of them. ;Take / TakeWhile: The Take operator selects the first n objects from a collection, while the TakeWhile operator, which takes a predicate, selects those objects that match the predicate (stopping at the first object that doesn't match it). ;Skip / SkipWhile: The Skip and SkipWhile operators are complements of Take and TakeWhile - they skip the first n objects from a collection, or those objects that match a predicate (for the case of SkipWhile). ;OfType: The OfType operator is used to select the elements of a certain type. ;Concat: The Concat operator concatenates two collections. ;OrderBy / ThenBy: The OrderBy operator is used to specify the primary sort ordering of the elements in a collection according to some key. The default ordering is in ascending order, to reverse the order, the OrderByDescending operator is to be used. ThenBy and ThenByDescending specifies subsequent ordering of the elements. The function to extract the key value from the object is specified by the user as a delegate. ;Reverse: The Reverse operator reverses a collection. ;GroupBy: The GroupBy operator takes a function that extracts a key value and returns a collection of \`IGrouping\` objects, for each distinct key value. The \`IGrouping\` objects can then be used to enumerate all the objects for a particular key value. ;Distinct: The Distinct operator removes duplicate instances of an object from a collection. An overload of the operator takes an equality comparer object which defines the criteria for distinctness. ;Union / Intersect / Except: These operators are used to perform a union, intersection and difference operation on two sequences, respectively. Each has an overload which takes an equality comparer object which defines the criteria for element equality. ;SequenceEqual: The SequenceEqual operator determines whether all elements in two collections are equal and in the same order. ;First / FirstOrDefault / Last / LastOrDefault: These operators take a predicate. The First operator returns the first element for which the predicate yields true, or, if nothing matches, throws an exception. The FirstOrDefault operator is like the First operator except that it returns the default value for the element type (usually a null reference) in case nothing matches the predicate. The last operator retrieves the last element to match the predicate, or throws an exception in case nothing matches. The LastOrDefault returns the default element value if nothing matches. ;Single: The Single operator takes a predicate and returns the element that matches the predicate. An exception is thrown, if none or more than one element match the predicate. ;SingleOrDefault: The SingleOrDefault operator takes a predicate and return the element that matches the predicate. If more than one element matches the predicate, an exception is thrown. If no element matches the predicate, a default value is returned. ;ElementAt: The ElementAt operator retrieves the element at a given index in the collection. ;Any / All: The Any operator checks, if there are any elements in the collection matching the predicate. It does not select the element, but returns true if at least one element is matched. An invocation of any without a predicate returns true if the collection non-empty. The All operator returns true if all elements match the predicate. ;Contains: The Contains operator checks, if the collection contains a given element. ;Count: The Count operator counts the number of elements in the given collection. An overload taking a predicate, counts the number of elements matching the predicate. The Standard Query Operator API also specifies certain operators that convert a collection into another type: * AsEnumerable: Statically types the collection as an \`IEnumerable\`. * AsQueryable: Statically types the collection as an \`IQueryable\`. * ToArray: Creates an array \`T[]\` from the collection. * ToList: Creates a \`List\` from the collection. * ToDictionary: Creates a \`Dictionary\` from the collection, indexed by the key K. A user supplied projection function extracts a key from each element. * ToLookup: Creates a \`Lookup\` from the collection, indexed by the key K. A user supplied projection function extracts a key from each element. * Cast: converts a non-generic \`IEnumerable\` collection to one of \`IEnumerable\` by casting each element to type \`T\`. Alternately converts a generic \`IEnumerable\` to another generic \`IEnumerable\` by casting each element from type \`T\` to type \`R\`. Throws an exception in any element cannot be cast to the indicated type. * OfType: converts a non-generic \`IEnumerable\` collection to one of \`IEnumerable\`. Alternately converts a generic \`IEnumerable\` to another generic \`IEnumerable\` by attempting to cast each element from type \`T\` to type \`R\`. In both cases, only the subset of elements successfully cast to the target type are included. No exceptions are thrown. =Language extensions= While LINQ is primarily implemented as a library for .NET Framework 3.5, it also defines optional language extensions that make queries a first-class language construct and provide syntactic sugar for writing queries. These language extensions have initially been implemented in C# 3.0, VB 9.0, F# and Oxygene, with other languages like Nemerle having announced preliminary support. The language extensions include: *Query syntax: A language is free to choose a query syntax that it will recognize natively. These language keywords must be translated by the compiler to appropriate LINQ method calls. *Implicitly typed variables: This enhancement allows variables to be declared without specifying their types. The languages C# 3.0 and Oxygene declare them with the \`var\` keyword. In VB9.0, the \`Dim\` keyword without type declaration accomplishes the same. Such objects are still strongly typed; for these objects the compiler infers the types of variables via type inference, which allows the results of the queries to be specified and defined without declaring the type of the intermediate variables. *Anonymous types: Anonymous types allow classes that contain only data-member declarations to be inferred by the compiler. This is useful for the Select and Join operators, whose result types may differ from the types of the original objects. The compiler uses type inference to determine the fields contained in the classes and generates accessors and mutators for these fields. *Object Initializer: Object initializers allow an object to be created and initialized in a single scope, as required for Select and Join operators. *Lambda expressions: Lambda expressions allow predicates and other projection functions to be written inline with a concise syntax, and support full lexical closure. They are captured into parameters as delegates or expression trees depending on the Query Provider. For example, in the query to select all the objects in a collection with \`SomeProperty\` less than 10, var results = from c in SomeCollection where c.SomeProperty < 10 select new {c.SomeProperty, c.OtherProperty}; foreach (var result in results) { Console.WriteLine(result); } the types of variables result, c and results all are inferred by the compiler in accordance to the signatures of the methods eventually used. The basis for choosing the methods is formed by the query expression-free translation result var results = SomeCollection .Where(c => c.SomeProperty < 10) .Select(c => new {c.SomeProperty, c.OtherProperty}); results.ForEach(x => {Console.WriteLine(x.ToString());}) =LINQ providers= The C#3.0 specification defines a Query Expression Pattern along with translation rules from a LINQ expression to an expression in a subset of C# 3.0 without LINQ expressions. The translation thus defined is actually un-typed, which, in addition to lambda expressions being interpretable as either delegates or expression trees, allows for a great degree of flexibility for libraries wishing to expose parts of their interface as LINQ expression clauses. For example, LINQ to Objects works on \`IEnumerable\`s and with delegates, whereas LINQ to SQL makes use of the expression trees. The expression trees are at the core of the LINQ extensibility mechanism, by which LINQ can be adapted for many data sources. The expression trees are handed over to LINQ Providers, which are data source-specific implementations that adapt the LINQ queries to be used with the data source. If they choose so, the LINQ Providers analyze the expression trees contained in a query in order to generate essential pieces needed for the execution of a query. This can be SQL fragments or any other completely different representation of code as further manipulatable data. LINQ comes with LINQ Providers for in-memory object collections, Microsoft SQL Server databases, ADO.NET datasets and XML documents. These different providers define the different flavors of LINQ: LINQ to Objects The LINQ to Objects provider is used for in-memory collections, using the local query execution engine of LINQ. The code generated by this provider refers to the implementation of the standard query operators as defined on the \`Sequence\` pattern and allows \`IEnumerable\` collections to be queried locally. Current implementation of LINQ to Objects perform interface implementation checks to allow for fast membership tests, counts, and indexed lookup operations when they are supported by the runtime type of the IEnumerable. LINQ to XML (formerly called XLINQ) The LINQ to XML provider converts an XML document to a collection of \`XElement\` objects, which are then queried against using the local execution engine that is provided as a part of the implementation of the standard query operator. LINQ to SQL (formerly called DLINQ) The LINQ to SQL provider allows LINQ to be used to query Microsoft SQL Server databases, including SQL Server Compact databases. Since SQL Server data may reside on a remote server, and because SQL Server has its own query engine, LINQ to SQL does not use the query engine of LINQ. Instead, it converts a LINQ query to a SQL query that is then sent to SQL Server for processing. However, since SQL Server stores the data as relational data and LINQ works with data encapsulated in objects, the two representations must be mapped to one another. For this reason, LINQ to SQL also defines a mapping framework. The mapping is done by defining classes that correspond to the tables in the database, and containing all or a subset of the columns in the table as data members. The correspondence, along with other relational model attributes such as primary keys, are specified using LINQ to SQL-defined attributes. For example, [Table(Name=\\"Customers\\")] public class Customer { [Column(IsPrimaryKey = true)] public int CustID; [Column] public string CustName; } This class definition maps to a table named \`Customers\` and the two data members correspond to two columns. The classes must be defined before LINQ to SQL can be used. Visual Studio 2008 includes a mapping designer that can be used to create the mapping between the data schemas in the object as well as the relational domain. It can automatically create the corresponding classes from a database schema, as well as allow manual editing to create a different view by using only a subset of the tables or columns in a table. The mapping is implemented by the \`DataContext\` that takes a connection string to the server, and can be used to generate a \`Table\` where T is the type to which the database table will be mapped. The \`Table\` encapsulates the data in the table, and implements the \`IQueryable\` interface, so that the expression tree is created, which the LINQ to SQL provider handles. It converts the query into T-SQL and retrieves the result set from the database server. Since the processing happens at the database server, local methods, which are not defined as a part of the lambda expressions representing the predicates, cannot be used. However, it can use the stored procedures on the server. Any changes to the result set are tracked and can be submitted back to the database server. LINQ to DataSets Since the LINQ to SQL provider (above) works only with Microsoft SQL Server databases, in order to support any generic database, LINQ also includes the LINQ to DataSets. It uses ADO.NET to handle the communication with the database. Once the data is in ADO.NET Datasets, LINQ to DataSets execute queries against these datasets. Performance Non-professional users may struggle with subtleties in the LINQ to Objects features and syntax. Naive LINQ implementation patterns can lead to a catastrophic degradation of performance. LINQ to XML and LINQ to SQL performance compared to ADO.NET depends on the use case. PLINQ Version 4 of the .NET framework includes PLINQ, or Parallel LINQ, a parallel execution engine for LINQ queries. It defines the \`ParallelQuery\` class. Any implementation of the \`IEnumerable\` interface can take advantage of the PLINQ engine by calling the \`AsParallel(this IEnumerable)\` extension method defined by the ParallelEnumerable class in the System.Linq namespace of the .NET framework. The PLINQ engine can execute parts of a query concurrently on multiple threads, providing faster results.

RBS train and bus station in Zollikofen. The yellow bus is operated by Swiss Post. Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn RBS () is a Swiss public transport company. It operates train, tram, and bus lines between Bern, Solothurn and Worb. There had been a desire for a direct connection between Solothurn and Bern since the middle of the nineteenth century, only partly satisfied by the opening of a standard gauge line between Solothurn and Burgdorf by the Emmentalbahn in 1876. A campaign for a line via Fraubrunnen finally resulted in a concession granted in 1912 for the Elektrische Solothurn-Bern-Bahn (ESB) to build a metre-gauge line between Solothurn and Zollikofen. Here it would connect with the Bern-Zollikofen-Bahn, which had been opened in the same year. The full line was opened on 9 April 1916, but for the first eight years, passengers were obliged to change trains in Zollikofen. Public pressure led to the fusion of the two lines into the Solothurn-Zollikofen-Bahn (SZB) in 1922. The town of Worb had been connected to Bern by the Bern-Worb-Bahn (BWB) in 1898, and the Worblentalbahn subsequently connected Worb with the villages of the Worble valley, making a connection with the BZB line at Worblaufen. The two lines to Worb fused in 1927 into the Vereinigte Bern-Worb-Bahnen (VBW). After a series of working agreements in the 1970s, the SZB and the VWB finally merged into the RBS in November 1984 through a series of mergers. 94% of RBS shares are owned by federal, cantonal and local authorities. As of 2006, the company has 361 employees and owns 185 vehicles. It operates on 57 km of track and 61 km of bus lines and transports 23.5 million passengers each year. The subterranean RBS train station in Bern is the country's eighth-largest in terms of passenger usage, with 49,000 people using it on peak days. This heavy usage leads to overcrowding during peak hours. To increase the station's passenger handling capacity and reduce overcrowding, strict rules have been put into place to govern passenger flow. A steady programme of track-doubling has significantly increased track capacity. Planning has already started to increase the size and capacity of the station in terms of passenger flow and number of trains it can handle. In 2009, a 15-minute interval for all lines was planned, which takes the station to the limit of its ability to handle passengers. New 120 km/h train sets have been introduced on the RE line (Bern - Solothurn) to enable running at 15-minute intervals. These sets were made by Stadler Rail AG.

Founded in 1982 by Ela Bhatt, it is located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Foundation Friends of Women's World Banking was established as a non-profit organization to promote direct participation of poor women in the economy through access to financial services. It was created to extend and expand informal credit supports and networks within India to link them to a global movement. Outreach FWWB-I combined its loans with technical assistance to ensure sustainable growth of microfinance institutions. From 1989 to 2010 it reached out to more than 300 institutions with technical assistance and nearly 200 with loan support. Till March 2010, FWWB-I had made a cumulative disbursement of around Rs. 11 billion benefitting 2.6 million women. Transformation FWWB-I, being a member of various networks, has played a significant role in the building of the sector. To expand its outreach to more institutions, FWWB-I promoted an NBFC Ananya Finance for Inclusive Growth (AFIG). FWWB-I hived off its micro finance activity to AFIG in April 2010. Ananya‚Äôs mandate is to continue to build the network of institutions that will successfully be able to balance their social mission with the commercial one. Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Das who had steered the growth of FWWB-I as an apex for the last twenty one years is now the Managing Director of Ananya Finance for Inclusive Growth. Current activity FWWB-I (Friends of Women's World Banking), under the leadership of Ms. Vijaylakshmi Das, will continue to work in the areas of women empowerment, strengthening community based and micro finance institutions, livelihood promotion and need based financial products and services that impact the lives of the poor. Both FWWB-I and AFIG have a common vision and goal of reaching out to larger number of low income households in the under served regions of the country. Niche FWWB specializes in dealing with small local lending organizations. It selects its partner organization through a rigorous screening process.

Louis-Philippe Dalembert (born December 8, 1962 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti) is a Haitian poet and novelist. He writes in both French and Haitian creole. His works have been translated into several languages. He now divides his home between Berlin, Paris and Port-au-Prince.  Life  The son of a school teacher and principal, Louis-Philippe Dalembert was born in Port-au-Prince on December 8, 1962. His father‚Äôs death, a few months later, drastically affected the economic situation of the family. As a result, he spent his early childhood in the populous neighbourhood of Bel-Air, in a feminine universe. With his mother needing to travel away during the week to teach in the countryside, he grew up surrounded by his mother‚Äôs cousins, his elder sister, his great-aunts and his maternal grandmother who controlled her family with the stick, in a Port-au-Prince that was run by the iron fisted Fran√ßois Duvalier, \\"Papa Doc\\". At the age of six, he experienced the first great break of his life: his family moved away from that neighbourhood. He drew on these formative very religious years lived under the sign of the sabbath to compose his novel Le crayon du bon Dieu n‚Äôa pas de gomme. Port-au- Prince during the 1960s and 70's, was also all about outdoor cinemas, and in particular drive-ins. One of these happened to be located right behind the new house, over the ravine. In the evening, the entire neighbourhood would meet on the empty lot and watch the film. Dalembert saw westerns, about which he is still mad, the first kung-fu films, and The Last Tango in Paris. The problem was that they couldn‚Äôt hear anything. They had to imagine the dialogue on their own, when of course someone didn‚Äôt play to the crowd with his own improvisations. Telling from this time forth became for him above all else making one see. Trained in literature and journalism, Dalembert worked first as a journalist in his homeland before leaving in 1986 for France where he obtained his PhD in comparative literature at the Sorbonne with a dissertation on the Cuban author, Alejo Carpentier. Since leaving Haiti, this polyglot vagabond (he juggles seven languages) has lived in Nancy, Paris, Rome, Jerusalem, Brazzaville, Kinshasa, Florence, and has traveled wherever his steps have taken him ... in the renewed echo of his native land. His work carries the trace of his vagabonding [roaming] (a concept he prefers to that of errance [free-wheeling]) in its permanent tension between two periods (a childhood from which he continues to view the world, and adulthood) and two or more spaces. His works have been translated into several languages including Spanish, Italian, German, Danish, English and Serbo-croate. Today Dalembert lives in-between Italy, France and Haiti. He sporadically teaches in universities, such as the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Bern. He is also known to be an avid soccer fan.

The conservancy covers approximately 72 km2. It is located along the eastern bank of the Tana River, and borders the former Tana River Primate Reserve (1976‚àí2007). Despite its small size, the conservancy is a core refuge and breeding ground for the endemic and critically endangered Hirola antelope. Together with the Arawale National Reserve, the conservancy forms a key part of the Hirola's habitat.  History  The Hirola population, endemic to north-eastern Kenya, has been at the centre of the formation of the conservancy. In 1963, fears for the species‚Äô survival prompted the defunct National Park Organization and the Game Department to attempt a precautionary translocation of about 50 Hirola to the Tsavo East National Park. Although well-intentioned, the translocation was strongly opposed by local communities. The escalating conflict in Somalia in the 1990s and continuous decrease in population numbers of the Hirola, led to a second translocation by the Kenyan Wildlife Service in 1996. A fresh opposition to the plan resulted in the formation of a number of community- based conservation groups, one of them successfully filing a case in the Kenyan High Court against any future translocation. Nevertheless, the translocations had resulted in an isolated and viable ex situ population of perhaps 120 Hirola antelopes in Tsavo East National Park. In 2005, with the aim to conserve the Hirola as part of their natural and cultural heritage, four local communities (Kotile, Korisa, Hara and Abaratilo), supported by the Northern Rangelands Trust, Northern Rangelands Trust developed and put forward a proposal to the government of Kenya to establish the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy.  Birds  The number of bird species in the conservancy is estimated at 350. 60% of the total number of bird families recorded in Kenya are present in the conservancy. 13 species are listed on East Africa's regional Red Data List, including the hooded vulture and Clarke's weaver. Other, more common species inhabiting the conservancy are the saddle-billed stork, eastern violet-backed sunbird, the white-throated bee-eater and the crested francolin. The conservancy is unique in that it has significant numbers of species of the East Africa Coast and the Somali-Masai biomes, species that qualify an area as an important bird area.

In August 2017, Hosono left the Democratic Party, the successor of the DPJ, with the intention to form his own political party. His reason for wanting to leave the party was because of its policy on security and amending the Constitution. In September, he collaborated with Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike and Diet member Masaru Wakasa to form a conservative opposition party named the Party of Hope. After the then-DP leader Seiji Maehara allowed party members to run under the Hope banner in the imminent general election, conservative-leaning DP representatives moved to Hope en masse. However, a significant bloc of ex-DP representatives were barred from running under the Hope ticket by then-party leader Koike. Several of these representatives then formed the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) to house liberal-leaning former DP members. Some chose to run as independents, including Yoshihiko Noda and Katsuya Okada. Despite appearing at the start of the campaign to be able to deprive Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of his majority, campaign blunders by Koike led the party to fall short of initial expectations. Hope lost seats and only became the second largest opposition party behind the CDP, which ran a relatively successful campaign despite being hastily established. When Hope merged with the Democratic Party in May 2018 to form the Democratic Party for the People, Hosono decided to not join the new party and became an independent member instead. Hosono later joined the Nikai faction of the LDP in January 2019 while remaining as an independent.

As Nelson lived until 1934, Winbush had a few years as a young boy to absorb his vivid first- person accounts of slavery and service with the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. As a slave youth, Louis Nelson had accompanied his master James Oldham's sons as a servant when they went to war from their plantation. He eventually became part of Company M, 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment of the Confederate Army, first working as a cook. The regiment was one of many Confederate cavalry formations that fell under the overall command of the noted Confederate cavalry general Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest. In Winbush's speeches and writing he frequently discusses Nelson. In the late stages of the war, Winbush claims, Nelson was allowed to serve as a rifleman and later as chaplain to both blacks and whites; he had already memorized the King James Bible by heart. As a descendant from Nelson, Winbush later qualified for membership in the Sons of Confederate Veterans. He notes that his grandfather received a state pension from Tennessee for Confederate veterans beginning in 1920.Aaron Jerome Martin, Behind the Dixie Stars, video, accessed 19 January 2012 Existing records classify him as a cook and servant, Simpson, Brooks D. \\"African Americans in Confederate Military Service: Myth and Reality\\" in Moody, Wesley, Alfred J.

Both Winbush's mother Ganelle and his maternal grandmother were teachers, and education was prized in their family. Winbush and his siblings all earned college degrees and some, like his sister Mary, also earned graduate degrees. She became a teacher and principal. Winbush earned an undergraduate degree in science and a master's degree in physics education. Marriage and children Winbush married Naomi Daniel of Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Mrs. Winbush passed in 1999. They have two children, five grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Career Winbush became a teacher and later an assistant principal, having a career in education like his mother and grandmother. In 1955 he moved with his family to Florida where the public school system resisted integration and retained segregated schools for years past the US Supreme Court ruling of Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that declared them unconstitutional. Opinions on Confederate history In 1991, after the NAACP began a campaign against the Confederate flag being celebrated on public buildings, Winbush disagreed with such sentiment and efforts, and decided to join the Sons of Confederate Veterans. He is a member of the SCV's Jacob Summerlin Camp #1516 in Kissimmee, Florida.\\"Jacob Summerlin Camp\\", Official Website As an adult he had learned more about his grandfather and his military service, and Winbush came to honor his support for the Confederacy. With his retirement from teaching, Winbush felt ready to speak out on public issues. For instance, unlike many other African Americans, he considers the Confederate flag part of Southern heritage and appropriate for public display. He has said that the South seceded from the Union because of states' rights, not slavery. \\"He denies that President Lincoln freed the slaves, explaining that the Emancipation Proclamation affected only the Confederate states, which were no longer under his authority.\\" Winbush has traveled widely visiting various SCV camps and other organizations willing to listen and consider his views about the Civil War and his heritage.Kollatz, Harry, Jr. \\"Sons of the Great Rebellion\\", The Metropolitan Monthly, August 1996, p. 62. He has been known to sing a Confederate song including the line, \\"....Black is nothing other than a darker shade of rebel gray.\\" In 1998 Winbush participated in making a video on Black Southern Heritage, directed by Dr. Edward Smith of American University, who is also an African-American SCV member. The video covers his grandfather's Confederate military service and qualification for a Confederate pension after the war, as well as elements of other African- American heritage. The NAACP and similar organizations have criticized Winbush for his support of what they believe are neo-Confederate causes; they think he misunderstands the history of the South.

In 2014, the first Jewish boat and the first Moroccan boat participated in the Amsterdam Pride Canal Parade.http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2014/08/136244/moroccan-lgbt- boat-sails-in-amsterdam-gay-pride-canal-parade/ Dana International was on the Jewish boat, as well as the Fokkens twins (Louise Fokkens and Martine Fokkens), who are famous in the Netherlands for having worked 50 years as sex workers in Amsterdam's Red Light District before their retirement earlier in 2014.http://forward.com/articles/203478/flamboyant-first-as-jewish-boat- floats-in-amsterda/ Marianne van Praag, a Reform rabbi from The Hague, was the only rabbi aboard the Jewish boat. The Amsterdam Gay Pride usually spans a week of various activities for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, including exhibitions, cultural and sport events. There are also street parties in the streets where there's a concentration of gay bars, like Reguliersdwarsstraat, Zeedijk, Warmoesstraat and alongside Amstel. On Rembrandtplein there's a closing party on the Sunday after the Canal Parade.Program Amsterdam Pride 2007 . Retrieved on 2007-10-13.  Name change Amsterdam Pride  In 2015, the board of the Amsterdam Gay Pride took a different approach towards the name of the festival. The ProGay foundation, that founded the festival, argued that the term 'Gay' did not sufficiently express the diversity amongst the participants of the Pride. President of the board, Irene Hemelaar, confirmed that the change will be happening, but the name change only came through in 2017. By changing the name of the festival they hoped to encourage other prides to become more inclusive in their annual events. The Netherland Police Units participate in a yearly event that illustrate the inclusion of the Netherlands. The Netherlands' Police Department wear pink uniforms during the festival to emphasis the departments' support in the LGBT community. In 2016, the EuroPride had changed its community name to LGBTI, I for intersexual, since it was the first year in which there was an appearance of an intersexual community in the festivals' program. Since the Netherlands have learned about the intersexual community, digesting and learning their culture has been their top priority. The name change and the appearance of the 'I' in LGBTI worked to form a more inclusive environment for all people to celebrate their gender and sexuality.  LGBT in Netherlands  The Netherlands shows a very high level of social acceptance to the LGBT community. Through the years, social acceptance towards LGBT groups has been increasing and the Netherlands received top rankings in several surveys into the attitude towards LGBT groups, relative to a number of other European countries such as Spain, the United Kingdom, etc. The tolerant attitude of different groups of Dutch people can be seen in some aspects of how the public view LGBT people, acceptance of equal rights for LGBT people, the visibility of the LGBT community and construction of networks of LGBT groups. For example, the Netherlands has the highest ranking in support for LGBT groups having the freedom to pursue their desired lifestyles, and feel most comfortable with LGBT political leaders. The attitude of the Dutch towards lesbians, gays and bisexuals is more open than that towards transgender people. This is also common in other European societies, which is caused by transgender people being less common than the LGB people, and therefore people being more likely to have more LGB friends or acquaintances than transgender friends or acquaintances. In the Netherlands, more than 75% of the interviewees revealed that they had LGB friends and hold a positive stance towards homosexuality while less than 10% of the interviewees revealed that they had transgender friends or acquaintances. The general view of the Dutch Society towards LGBT is positive and people support and are open to promoting the equalities and freedom of LGBT community.

He became a Fellow of the Royal Society on 16 January 1772, a foreign member of the Imperial Academy at Brussels in 1773, and a correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences in 1776. Life and career Born in Whitton, Middlesex, Pigott was the son of Ralph Pigott of Whitton by his wife Alethea, daughter of the eighth Viscount Fairfax. He was the grandson of barrister Nathaniel Pigott (1661‚Äì1737), a Roman Catholic and intimate friend of poet Alexander Pope, who eulogised him in an epitaph inscribed in the parish church of Twickenham. The younger Nathaniel Pigott married Anna Mathurina, daughter of Monsieur de B√©riol, and spent some years at Caen in Normandy for the education of his children. He and his family led a somewhat vagrant life in various parts of Britain and the Continent, where conditions were more congenial for the staunchly Catholic family. It is not known when Pigott first became interested in astronomy. However, he was able to purchase fine instruments from London craftsmen and became known for observational ability and computational accuracy. The Academy of Sciences of Caen chose him a foreign member about 1764, and he observed there, with John Dollond's six-foot achromatic telescope, the partial solar eclipse of 16 August 1765. His observations of the transit of Venus on 3 June 1769 were transmitted to the French Academy of Sciences; his meteorological record at Caen, from 1765 to 1769, to the Royal Society, of which body he was elected a fellow on 16 January 1772. He maintained a friendly relationship with astronomer William Herschel. In Brussels in 1772, he undertook, at the request of the government, to determine the geographical positions of the principal towns of the Low Countries. The work occupied five months and was carried out at his own expense, with the assistance of his son Edward Pigott and of his servants. The longitudes were obtained from observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, the latitudes by means of meridian altitudes taken with a Bird's quadrant lent by the Royal Society. Pigott described these operations in a letter to Nevil Maskelyne, dated Louvain, 11 August 1775, and their results were printed at large in the Memoirs of the Brussels Academy of Sciences. He was chosen a foreign member of the Brussels Academy on 25 May 1773, and a correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences on 12 June 1776. Pigott also participated in an unusual experiment on 1 November 1773, to ascertain variances in barometric pressure created by the ringing of the 16,000-pound bell of the cathedral of Ste. Goedule in Brussels. Pigott spent part of the summer of 1777 at Lady Widdrington's house in Gloucestershire, of which he determined the longitude, and then took up his residence at Frampton House, Glamorganshire, on his own estate. Here he fitted up an observatory with a transit by Sisson, a six-foot achromatic by Dollond, and several smaller telescopes. He ascertained its latitude, and in 1778‚Äì9 discovered some double stars. He and his son Edward also investigated and corrected the mapping of many localities in the area. In 1783 he sent to the Royal Society an account of a remarkable meteor seen by him while riding across Hewit (Heworth) Common, near York. He observed at the Coll√®ge Royal, Louvain, a few days after his arrival from England, the transit of Mercury of 3 May 1786. Pigott died abroad in 1804. His son Edward, who assisted in many of his observations, became a noted astronomer in his own right. His second son, Charles Gregory Pigott, assumed the name Fairfax on succeeding his cousin, Anne Fairfax, in 1793, in the possession of Gilling Castle, Yorkshire; he married in 1794 Mary, sister of Sir Henry Goodricke, and died in 1845. The possession of Gilling Castle had been the subject of a lengthy family dispute. Publications * 1782 (with Dr William White): \\"Observations on the Bills of Mortality at York.

Quantitative proteomics is an analytical chemistry technique for determining the amount of proteins in a sample. The methods for protein identification are identical to those used in general (i.e. qualitative) proteomics, but include quantification as an additional dimension. Rather than just providing lists of proteins identified in a certain sample, quantitative proteomics yields information about the physiological differences between two biological samples. For example, this approach can be used to compare samples from healthy and diseased patients. Quantitative proteomics is mainly performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) or mass spectrometry (MS). However, a recent developed method of quantitative dot blot (QDB) analysis is able to measure both the absolute and relative quantity of an individual proteins in the sample in high throughput format, thus open a new direction for proteomic research. In contrast to 2-DE, which requires MS for the downstream protein identification, MS technology can identify and quantify the changes.  Quantification using spectrophotometry  The concentration of a certain protein in a sample may be determined using spectrophotometric procedures.Ninfa, Ballou, Benore. Fundamental Approaches to Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 2nd edition 2010. Fitzgerald Science Press, Bethesda, MD. The concentration of a protein can be determined by measuring the OD at 280 nm on a spectrophotometer, which can be used with a standard curve assay to quantify the presence of Tryptophan, Tyrosine, and Phenylalanine. However, this method is not the most accurate because the composition of proteins can vary greatly and this method would not be able to quantify proteins that do not contain the aforementioned amino acids. This method is also inaccurate due to the possibility of nucleic acid contamination. Other more accurate spectrophotometric procedures for protein quantification include the Biuret, Lowry, BCA, and Bradford methods. Quantification using two dimensional electrophoresis  Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) represents one of the main technologies for quantitative proteomics with advantages and disadvantages. 2-DE provides information about the protein quantity, charge, and mass of the intact protein. It has limitations for the analysis of proteins larger than 150 kDa or smaller than 5kDa and low solubility proteins. Quantitative MS has higher sensitivity but does not provide information about the intact protein. Classical 2-DE based on post-electrophoretic dye staining has limitations: at least three technical replicates are required to verify the reproducibility. Difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) uses fluorescence-based labeling of the proteins prior to separation has increased the precision of quantification as well as the sensitivity in the protein detection. Therefore, DIGE represents the current main approach for the 2-DE based study of proteomes.  Quantification using mass spectrometry  Examples of quantitative proteomic workflows. Red represents physiological sample of interest, while blue represents control sample. White boxes represent areas where errors are most likely to occur, and purple boxes represent where the samples have been mixed. Mass spectrometry (MS) represents one of the main technologies for quantitative proteomics with advantages and disadvantages. Quantitative MS has higher sensitivity but can provide only limited information about the intact protein. Quantitative MS has been used for both discovery and targeted proteomic analysis to understand global proteomic dynamics in populations of cells (bulk analysis) or in individual cells (single-cell analysis). Early approaches developed in the 1990s applied isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT), which uses two reagents with heavy and light isotopes, respectively, and a biotin affinity tag to modify cysteine containing peptides. This technology has been used to label whole Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and, in conjunction with mass spectrometry, helped lay the foundation of quantitative proteomics. This approach has been superseded by isobaric mass tags, which are also used for single-cell protein analysis. =Relative and absolute quantification= Mass spectrometry is not inherently quantitative because of differences in the ionization efficiency and/or detectability of the many peptides in a given sample, which has sparked the development of methods to determine relative and absolute abundance of proteins in samples. The intensity of a peak in a mass spectrum is not a good indicator of the amount of the analyte in the sample, although differences in peak intensity of the same analyte between multiple samples accurately reflect relative differences in its abundance. =Stable isotope labeling in mass spectrometry= Stable isotope labels An approach for relative quantification that is more costly and time-consuming, though less sensitive to experimental bias than label-free quantification, entails labeling the samples with stable isotope labels that allow the mass spectrometer to distinguish between identical proteins in separate samples. One type of label, isotopic tags, consist of stable isotopes incorporated into protein crosslinkers that causes a known mass shift of the labeled protein or peptide in the mass spectrum. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together, and the differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately reflect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins. Absolute proteomic quantification using isotopic peptides entails spiking known concentrations of synthetic, heavy isotopologues of target peptides into an experimental sample and then performing LC-MS/MS. As with relative quantification using isotopic labels, peptides of equal chemistry co-elute and are analyzed by MS simultaneously. Unlike relative quantification, though, the abundance of the target peptide in the experimental sample is compared to that of the heavy peptide and back-calculated to the initial concentration of the standard using a pre-determined standard curve to yield the absolute quantification of the target peptide. Relative quantification methods include isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT), isobaric labeling (tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)), label-free quantification metal-coded tags (MeCAT), N-terminal labelling, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS). A mathematically rigorous approach that integrates peptide intensities and peptide-measurement agreement into confidence intervals for protein ratios has emerged. Absolute quantification is performed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Metal-coded tags Metal-coded tags (MeCAT) method is based on chemical labeling, but rather than using stable isotopes, different lanthanide ions in macrocyclic complexes are used. The quantitative information comes from inductively coupled plasma MS measurements of the labeled peptides. MeCAT can be used in combination with elemental mass spectrometry ICP-MS allowing first-time absolute quantification of the metal bound by MeCAT reagent to a protein or biomolecule. Thus it is possible to determine the absolute amount of protein down to attomol range using external calibration by metal standard solution. It is compatible to protein separation by 2D electrophoresis and chromatography in multiplex experiments. Protein identification and relative quantification can be performed by MALDI-MS/MS and ESI-MS/MS. Mass spectrometers have a limited capacity to detect low-abundance peptides in samples with a high dynamic range. The limited duty cycle of mass spectrometers also restricts the collision rate, resulting in an undersampling Sample preparation protocols represent sources of experimental bias. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a method that involves metabolic incorporation of ‚Äúheavy‚Äù C- or N-labeled amino acids into proteins followed by MS analysis. SILAC requires growing cells in specialized media supplemented with light or heavy forms of essential amino acids, lysine or arginine. One cell population is grown in media containing light amino acids while the experimental condition is grown in the presence of heavy amino acids. The heavy and light amino acids are incorporated into proteins through cellular protein synthesis. Following cell lysis, equal amounts of protein from both conditions are combined and subjected to proteotypic digestion. Arginine and lysine amino acids were chosen, because trypsin, the predominant enzyme used to generate proteotypic peptides for MS analysis, cleaves at the C-terminus of lysine and arginine. Following digestion with trypsin, all the tryptic peptides from cells grown in SILAC media would have at least one labeled amino acid, resulting in a constant mass shift from the labeled sample over non-labeled. Because the peptides containing heavy and light amino acids are chemically identical, they co-elute during reverse-phase column fractionation and are detected simultaneously during MS analysis. The relative protein abundance is determined by the relative peak intensities of the isotopically distinct peptides. Traditionally the level of multiplexing in SILAC was limited due to the number of SILAC isotopes available. Recently, a new technique called NeuCode SILAC, has augmented the level of multiplexing achievable with metabolic labeling (up to 4). The NeuCode amino acid method is similar to SILAC but differs in that the labeling only utilizes heavy amino acids. The use of only heavy amino acids eliminates the need for 100% incorporation of amino acids needed for SILAC. The increased multiplexing capability of NeuCode amino acids is from the use of mass defects from extra neutrons in the stable isotopes. These small mass differences however need to be resolved on high resolution mass spectrometers. One of the main benefits of SILAC is the level of quantitation bias from processing errors is low because heavy and light samples are combined before sample preparation for MS analysis. SILAC and NeuCode SILAC are excellent techniques for detecting small changes in protein levels or post-translational modifications between experimental groups. Isobaric labeling Isobaric mass tags (tandem mass tags) are tags that have identical mass and chemical properties that allow heavy and light isotopologues to co-elute together. All mass tags consist of a mass reporter that has a unique number of 13C substitutions, a mass normalizer that has a unique mass that balances the mass of the tag to make all the tags equal in mass and a reactive moiety that crosslinks to the peptides. These tags are designed to cleave at a specific linker region upon high-energy CID, yielding different-sized tags that are then quantitated by LC-MS/MS. Protein or peptide samples prepared from cells, tissues or biological fluids are labeled in parallel with the isobaric mass tags and combined for analysis. Protein quantitation is accomplished by comparing the intensities of the reporter ions in the MS/MS spectra. Three types of tandem mass tags are available with different reactivity: (1) reactive NHS ester which provides high-efficiency, amine-specific labeling (TMTduplex, TMTsixplex, TMT10plex and TMT11plex), (2) reactive iodacetyl function group which labels sulfhydryl-(-SH) groups (iodoTMT) and (3) reactive alkoxyamine functional group which provides covalent labeling of carbonyl-containing compounds (aminoxyTMT). A key benefit of isobaric labeling over other quantification techniques (e.g. SILAC, ICAT, Label-free) is the increased multiplex capabilities and thus increased throughput potential. The ability to combine and analyze several samples simultaneously in one LC-MS run eliminates the need to analyze multiple data sets and eliminates run-to-run variation. Multiplexing reduces sample processing variability, improves specificity by quantifying the proteins from each condition simultaneously, and reduces turnaround time for multiple samples. The current available isobaric chemical tags facilitate the simultaneous analysis of up to 11 experimental samples. =Label-free quantification in mass spectrometry= One approach for relative quantification is to separately analyze samples by MS and compare the spectra to determine peptide abundance in one sample relative to another, as in label- free strategies. It is generally accepted, that while label-free quantification is the least accurate of the quantification paradigms, it is also inexpensive and reliable when put under heavy statistical validation. There are two different methods of quantification in label-free quantitative proteomics: AUC (area under the curve) and spectral counting. Methods of label-free quantification AUC is a method by which for a given peptide spectrum in an LC-MS run, the area under the spectral peak is calculated. AUC peak measurements are linearly proportional to the concentration of protein in a given analyte mixture. Quantification is achieved with through ion counts, the measurement of the amount of an ion at a specific retention time. Discretion is required for the standardization of the raw data. High- resolution spectrometer can alleviated problems that arise when trying to make data reproducible, however much of the work regarding normalizing data can be done through software such as OpenMS, and MassView. Spectral counting involves counting the spectra of an identified protein and then standardizing using some form of normalization. Typically this is done with an abundant peptide mass selection (MS) that is then fragmented and then MS/MS spectra are counted. Multiple samplings of the protein peak is required for accurate estimation of the protein abundance because of the complex physiochemical nature of peptides. Thus, optimization for MS/MS experiments is a constant concern. One alternative to get around this problems is use a data independent technique that cycles between high and low collision energies. Thus a large survey of all possible precursor and product ions is collected. This is limited, however, by the mass spectrometry software's ability to recognize and match peptide patterns of associations between the precursor and product ions.

(C) is the candidate list of kinases that indicate physiological differences in Œ± and Œ≤ cells. = Biomedical applications = Quantitative proteomics has distinct applications in the medical field. Especially in the fields of drug and biomarker discovery. LC- MS/MS techniques have started to over take more traditional methods like the western blot and ELISA due to the cumbersome nature of labeling different and separating proteins using these methods and the more global analysis of protein quantification. Mass spectrometry methods are more sensitive to difference in protein structure like post-translational modification and thus can quantify differing modifications to proteins. Quantitative proteomics can circumvent these issues, only needing sequence information to be performed. Disadvantages, however, in sensitivity and analysis time must be kept in consideration.  Drug discovery  Quantitative proteomics has the largest applications in the protein target identification, protein target validation, and toxicity profiling of drug discovery. Drug discovery has been used to investigate protein-protein interaction and, more recently, drug-small molecule interactions. Thus, it has shown great promise in monitoring side- effects of small drug-like molecules and understanding the efficacy and therapeutic effect of one drug target over another. One of the more typical methodologies for absolute protein quantification in drug discovery is the use of LC-MS/MS with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).

In 1939, he married Dorothy Jean Carswell. Smye first worked with the Canadian aircraft industry during World War II in 1940 as an official in the New York, Washington and Ottawa offices of the Department of Munitions and Supply, eventually becoming Director of Aircraft Production. In 1944 he was appointed Assistant General Manager of Federal Aircraft Limited in Montreal to wind up the Canadian Government's aircraft production program. At the close of the war he played a key role in establishing the British Hawker Siddeley Group in Canada through the formation of A.V. Roe Canada Limited. On August 1, 1945, Smye became the first employee of A.V. Roe Canada established in the former Victory Aircraft facilities at Malton, Ontario. With the official formation of Avro Aircraft on December 1, 1945, he was appointed Assistant General Manager. He was a lead administrator of all the major Avro projects: the Jetliner, the CF-100, the Orenda engines to power it, and the Arrow supersonic interceptor. He held various A. V. Roe Canada positions including President of Avro Aircraft, Executive Vice-President (aeronautical) and Board Member of several A. V. Roe subsidiaries. After the cancellation of the Arrow by the Diefenbaker government in 1959, Smye resigned from A. V.

The trio were sentenced to life imprisonment. Background Nisha Patel-Nasri was a 29-year-old Luton-born Hindu Gujarati British Indian who grew up in London and ran a hairdressing business near her home in Wembley. She also volunteered as a special constable in the Metropolitan Special Constabulary for the three years prior to her death.2006 September 12, BBC, Stabbed Pc's murder weapon found In Berkshire in May 2003, she married 33-year-old Beirut-born Fadi Nasri who ran a limousine hire company from their home.Marriages England and Wales 1984‚Äì2005 On the night before her murder, Patel-Nasri and her husband had dined out to celebrate their third wedding anniversary. Murder Patel-Nasri's home was in a neighbourhood with generally low crime rates, but the Saturday before her murder three men, initially believed to be burglars, attempted to enter her home but fled after they were confronted by her at around 10 pm. On the evening of 11 May 2006, Patel-Nasri was reported to have gone outside her home carrying a chef's knife. It is believed that this was the murder weapon.2006 May 16, Telegraph, Duncan Gardham, \\" Volunteer Pc 'was killed with her own kitchen knife'\\" A man wearing a hooded top was seen running away from the scene. During the subsequent trial, it transpired that Patel-Nasri had been stabbed inside her home and had staggered outside the front door before collapsing. She died in Northwick Park Hospital as a result of a stab wound to her left thigh. Police investigation As expensive limousines were parked outside her home the police initially tried to understand whether this could have attracted the murderer. Police also considered what could have caused her to go outside her house that night, carrying a knife. The murder weapon was found but forensic analysis failed to match the DNA on it to any person on the national database. Patel-Nasri's widower, Fadi Nasri, was arrested on 27 February 2007 as a suspect in the case. The murder was examined on the BBC television programme Crimewatch Solved on 6 August 2008. The programme revealed how Nasri came to be linked to the murder, despite having an alibi placing him nowhere near the scene. Through his mobile phone records on the day, police investigators linked Nasri to Roger Leslie, a known criminal and heroin dealer; to Jason Jones, a nightclub bouncer with several previous convictions; and to Tony Emmanuel, a nightclub promoter. Through a CCTV camera near the scene where the knife was found, it was concluded that it was Emmanuel's car, a silver Audi, from which the murder weapon had been dumped. Although the number-plate could not be made out, it was identified as being Jones' car by the fact it had a non-standard roof aerial and a defective left rear number-plate light. Emmanuel could also be placed near the scene on the night of the murder. Emmanuel admitted that he had been hired by Jones to drive him to the house on the pretense of doing a drugs deal, but insisted he did not know that Jones was going to commit a murder. Through statements from Emmanuel attributed to Jones about money being counted inside the house on the night of the murder, it was concluded that Jones must have been inside and had been provided with a key. It was concluded that Jones had stabbed Patel-Nasri inside and she had staggered outside as Jones fled. After being presented with the phone records linking the men, with investigators initially thinking the murder was carried out by Leslie as part of a feud, Nasri confessed to having paid Leslie to commit the murder. Through subsequent investigation, the police concluded the motive for the crime was monetary; through an extravagant lifestyle and a failing business, Nasri had accumulated six-figure debts. The couple had taken mutual life insurance policies three months before, which paid out ¬£100,000. Additionally, following her death, Nasri attempted to claim his wife's entitlement to half of the equity of her parents' house from her brother, amounting to nearly ¬£400,000. =Convictions= At the Old Bailey on 28 May 2008, after six days of deliberation, Emmanuel was acquitted but Nasri, Leslie and Jones were all convicted of murder by a jury majority of ten to two. The following month, Leslie was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum tariff of eighteen years, which would keep him in prison until 2026 and the age of 56, and both Jones and Nasri were sentenced to life with tariffs of twenty years, which would keep them imprisoned until 2028 and the ages of 56 and 54 respectively.Life sentences for killers of Nisha Patel- Nasri - Metropolitan Police Service References Category:1977 births Category:2006 deaths Category:2006 in London Category:Murder in London Category:2006 murders in the United Kingdom Category:People from Luton Category:Women Metropolitan Police officers Category:Metropolitan Special Constabulary officers Category:People murdered in England Category:Murdered British police officers Category:English people of Indian descent ","title":"Nisha Patel-Nasri"},{"id":"13706991","text":"The Deep is a children's novel by English writer Helen Dunmore, published in 2007 and the third of the Ingo tetralogy (following Ingo and The Tide Knot and to be followed by The Crossing of Ingo). Plot summary A devastating flood has torn through the worlds of Air and Ingo, and now, deep in the ocean, a monster is stirring. Mer legend says that only those with dual blood--half Mer, half human--can overcome the Kraken that stirs in The Deep. Sapphire must return to the Deep, with the help of her friend the whale, and face this terrifying creature - and her brother Conor and Mer friend Faro will not let her go without them. Those with pure Mer blood cannot go to the Deep. Sapphire has moved back into the cottage by the cove, and is visiting Ingo all the time. When she is summoned to an assembly of the Mer she learns that the Kraken, a creature with the power to destroy their world, has awakened. Sapphire makes a deal with the Mer: if she and Conor help put the Kraken back to sleep their father will have the choice to leave Ingo. Ervys, a spokesperson (self-proclaimed leader, which the Mer do not have, as it causes problems) for the Mer, is outraged by this deal but gives his approval so the Mer will be safe. Sapphire, Conor and Faro (Faro should not be able to go to The Deep, but in Saldowr's mirror, he sees that he is not pure Mer, but part Human) go into the Deep with the help of the whale (that saves Sapphire from the Deep in The Tide Knot) to find the Kraken, and put him to sleep. It is not revealed what the Kraken really is, but it is clearly a shapeshifter. After a battle of minds, Sapphire manages to get the Kraken to sleep, and with Conor and Faro she goes back to the Mer to tell them the good news. Ervys is still furious especially when Faro asks Sapphire to make the crossing of Ingo with him. She agrees, but only on the condition that Conor may go too. Faro counters by insisting that his sister will also go. Although Sapphire does not want Elvira and Conor together, she agrees. When Sapphire and Conor return home they are horrified when their mother and her boyfriend Roger tell them they are all moving to Australia for three months. After talking with her friend Rainbow and Granny Carne Sapphire tells Conor she does not want to leave, and they tell their mother and Roger that they won't be going. Jennie and Roger reluctantly decide to go without them. The final chapter ends with Faro and Sapphire making Deublek, or friendship bracelets out of their hair.

They also hunt small marsupials and cassowaries. Yams Yam growing forms a large part of Abelam society. The growing of large yams (they can be as large as 80- long) determines the status of individuals as well as the whole village. At yam festivals an individual would give his largest yam to his worst enemy who would then be obligated to grow an even larger yam or have his status fall each year in which he was unable to do so. Separate villages would gather at yam festivals where the hosting villages status would be determined by the size of their yams as well as their ability to provide more food than could be eaten and carried away by the rival village. During the yam growing season, strong emotions were kept to a minimum as they were thought to impede the growth of the yams. Fighting was taboo as was sexual activity.

Education and career He was born in West Hartlepool the son of Horace Stanley Raine Westoll. He was educated at the West Hartlepool Grammar School. He then studied Sciences on a scholarship at Durham University, specialising in geology and palaeontology, graduating BSc in 1932. Continuing as a postgraduate he gained his first doctorate (PhD) in 1934 from research on Permian fishes. In 1937 he began lecturing in Geology and Mineralogy at Aberdeen University, his central interest being the study of fossil fish. In 1943 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Robert MacFarlane Neill, Thomas Phemister, Ernest Cruickshank, and James Robert Matthews. Aberdeen University awarded him his second doctorate (DSc). In 1948 he left Aberdeen to return to England as Professor of Geology at the University of Newcastle, staying there until his retirement in 1977. In retirement he remained as a research fellow and Chairman of Convocation. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in March 1952. The citation on his application read: \\"Westoll is a palaeontologist who by his description of new materials and by the introduction of new and fertile ideas into the interpretation of the structure of early fossil vertebrates has greatly increased our understanding of the problems they present. He has introduced new views about the origins of the pectoral fins of craniates and of the Tetrapod limb. He has clarified our ideas about the homologies of the dermal skull bones of vertebrates and made a new and convincing comparison between the skulls of Amphibia and Fish. He has made important contributions towards the solution of the old problems of the origin of the mammalian palate and ear. His monograph of the Haplolepidae sets a new standard for taxonomic work on fossil fish\\". He was on the council of the Royal Society and from 1972 to 1974 was President of the Geological Society of London. He died in Newcastle upon Tyne on 19 September 1995. Family He married twice: firstly in 1939 to Dorothy Cecil Isobel Wood, then, following divorce in 1951, in 1952 he married Barbara Swanson McAdie. Research interests His research interests were wide-ranging, but he is best known for his work on the evolution of fish. The development of the tetrapod limb and issues with the Silurian-Devonian boundary were some of the topics which occupied him.

The scandal involved several prominent men, including TV presenter Carlos Cruz, former Casa Pia governor Manuel Abrantes, and former UNESCO ambassador Jorge Ritto. The trial was one of the longest running in Portuguese history, lasting more than five years, with testimony from 32 alleged victims, out of a total of over 800 witnesses and experts. On 3 September 2010, Carlos Cruz, Carlos Silvino, Hugo Mar√ßal, Manuel Abrantes, Ferreira Diniz and Jorge Ritto were convicted and sentenced to up to eighteen years in prison due to crimes occurring in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was the first time an institutional sex abuse scandal had been taken to court in Portugal. First revelations Portuguese Judiciary Police (Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria) first accused the caretaker of a Casa Pia state-run children's home in 1981 of raping dozens of children over a period of 30 years, even though some reports of abuse pre-date the 1974 Carnation Revolution. Police accused the perpetrators of supplying children to men from Portugal and other countries, including to some prominent public figures in Portugal. However, these early allegations did not result in any legal action. Second revelations The scandal of alleged sexual abuse at the state-run Casa Pia orphanages resurfaced when several former orphanage children came forward with accusations of abuse. The accusations linked some politicians, diplomats, and media celebrities‚Äîall of whom were alleged to have conspired in a paedophilia ring that had operated for decades. The scandal broke in September 2002 when the mother of one alleged victim, known as Joel, complained of abuse by staff at a Casa Pia house. Former Casa Pia children came forward to publicly accuse several employees of sexual abuse. The weekly magazine Vis√£o reported that a Portuguese diplomat, Jorge Ritto, was removed from his post as consul in Stuttgart (1969‚Äì1971) after German authorities complained to Lisbon about his involvement with an under-age boy in a public park.Pedro Vieira, VIS√ÉO (Portuguese magazine) number 508, Accused were diplomat Jorge Ritto, Carlos Cruz, Carlos Silvino (a.k.a. Bibi, an employee of Casa Pia and a former pupil in the institution), Ferreira Diniz (a physician from Lisbon), Hugo Mar√ßal (a lawyer who represented Carlos Silvino in the early stages of the process) and among other individuals, a marine archaeologist. Secretary of State for Labor and Training from 1999 to 2001, Paulo Pedroso, who was responsible for the Casa Pia homes, which care for some 4,600 children at 10 centers around Portugal, was suspected of 15 cases of sexual violence against minors, which allegedly took place between 1999 and 2000. His case was also subsequently dropped. In September 2008, a Portuguese court ordered the state to pay 100,000 euros ($140,000) to the ex-minister Paulo Pedroso, on the grounds that he was wrongly detained on paedophilia charges. Casa Pia: Paulo Pedroso ganha ac√ß√£o contra o Estado The Socialist Party leader at the time, Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, who was a close personal friend of Paulo Pedroso, offered to undergo police questioning after \\"he had learned of plans to implicate him in the [Casa Pia] scandal\\". The weekly paper Expresso published a report on 25 May 2003, from four children who said they saw Ferro Rodrigues at locations where sexual abuse was taking place. The paper said there was no evidence he was personally involved and the Attorney General Jos√© Souto de Moura insisted he was not a suspect. Ferro Rodrigues took legal action against those who said they saw him at locations where sexual abuse was taking place. Rodrigues has said, \\"I want it to be clear: our fight will be serene but determined and it is and will only be directed at those who are responsible for this defamation, whatever their objective is.\\" The Prime Minister at the time, Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso, whose Social Democratic Party ousted the Socialists in March 2002, promised to bring life and honor back into the Casa Pia children's homes and allow new director Catalina Pestana to reform the institution. As a result, several senior staff of Casa Pia were fired after the 2002 revelations. However, Pestana told parliament and the media, as late as 2007, that there may still be paedophiles in the Casa Pia system. She also criticised the legal changes made after the start of the trial, which she claims were made in order to help those who were present to court. Casa Pia: Catalina Pestana diz que n√£o quis criticar juizes , , Di√°rio Digital These controversial legal changes were partially reverted just before the sentence in September 2010. Caso de pedofilia obrigou pol√≠ticos a alterar as leis, Associa√ß√£o Sindical dos Ju√≠zes Portugueses The Casa Pia abuse scandal has had the effect of raising public awareness of sexual abuse of children. The number of incidents reported to Portuguese police has soared after the scandal has been revealed. Catarina Guerreiro, Menores: triplicou n√∫mero de queixas de pedofilia na PJ CASA PIA FAZ DISPARAR DEN√öNCIAS DE ABUSO , Correio da Manh√£ Investigation and trial The Casa Pia child sex abuse trial started in 2004. In 2004, as an arguido involved in the trial, Carlos Cruz published a book of personal reflections, Preso 374.; Publisher: Oficina do Livro The final allegations, formerly scheduled for 20 October 2008 in Lisbon were postponed several times. The country's justice system, often accused of being excruciatingly slow, is believed by some opinion makers such as journalists and Catalina Pestana (former head of Casa Pia), to be vulnerable to external pressures of well-connected personalities and the possibility of corrupting external interference has been considered a real danger, according to those critics. They feared that even if Carlos Silvino (the Casa Pia driver), whose initial trial had been twice postponed, is found guilty, better-connected abusers might go free. Casa Pia: Catalina Pestana alega que julgamento se arrasta porque era preciso esperar por \\"leis mais brandas\\" , , P√∫blico On 3 September 2010, Carlos Cruz (seven years), Carlos Silvino (eighteen years), Hugo Mar√ßal (six years, two months), Manuel Abrantes (five years, nine months), Ferreira Diniz (seven years) and Jorge Ritto (six years, eight months) were convicted on charges of paedophilia and other crimes occurring in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Tribunal d√° 17 crimes como provados, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias (3 September 2010) The full ruling, which allegedly runs to nearly 2,000 pages, was due to be released on 8 September 2010. However, it was delayed several times due to a Microsoft Word glitch. At√© a Microsoft foi dar uma ajuda √† ju√≠za da Casa Pia, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias (11 September 2010)Child Abuse Verdict Held Back By MS Word Glitch, Slashdot (12 September 2010) On 13 September 2010 the full ruling containing the verdict was released. According to chief prosecutor Miguel Matias, the victims were pleased with the outcome. The court ruling was hailed as a victory by those fighting for Casa Pia children's rights in Portugal, such as Pedro Namora, a former pupil at Casa Pia and now a lawyer who publicly supported the victims, and Catalina Pestana, who was head of Casa Pia during the period when some of the cases were made public in the early 2000s.Portuguese court finds 6 guilty of child abuse , The Daily Herald See also *Child abuse *Richard Webster *Sexual misconduct References External links *Confession of Pedro Cust√≥dio saying he lied in court Category:School sexual abuse scandals Category:Violence in Portugal Category:1981 in Portugal Category:2004 in Portugal Category:2010 in Portugal Category:1981 crimes in Portugal Category:2004 crimes in Portugal Category:2010 crimes in Portugal Category:1981 in law Category:2004 in law Category:2010 in law Category:Institutional abuse Category:Sexual abuse cover- ups Category:Sex gangs Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:Scandals in Portugal Category:Violence against children Category:Violence against men in Europe ","title":"Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal"},{"id":"13707072","text":"\\"This One Eats Souls\\" is a single by The Blackeyed Susans, released in July 1994, from their 1993 album, All Souls Alive.

He was the chief executive officer (CEO) of Statoil from 1999 to 2003, and of Hurtigruten from 2007 to 2012. Career Fjell has a siv.√∏k. degree from the Norwegian School of Economics in 1975 as well as education from the Royal Norwegian Army. His career started as an accountant at Kongsberg Vaabenfabrik in 1975 where he stayed until 1987, by which time he had become vice president. He had a continual employment in Bergen Bank, Den norske Bank and finally as CEO of Postbanken until he was hired as CEO of Statoil in 1999. After quitting in Statoil in 2004 he worked as a strategic and financial adviser for First Securities. He was later chief executive of Lindorff from 2006 to 2007 and Hurtigruten from 2007 to 2012. He has also had a number of board positions, including chairman of NSB (Norwegian State Railways) from 2000 to 2003, in Eastern Drilling and Lindorff. He currently chairs of the boards of Statkraft and Deep Sea Supply. He is a fellow of the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences. Controversy As a controversial businessperson, Fjell has had a strained relationship with the press. In his last period as CFO in Kongsberg, he had massive problems internally because of the company's economic fall and felt that the press was excessive and critical. As in 2003 with the Statoil corruption case in Iran it was Dagens N√¶ringsliv that led the critical journalism. It ended with him being decommissioned from his position with Kongsberg. Fjell was central in the corruption scandal that Statoil experienced in 2003. After pressure both internally and from the media the board had to remove Fjell on the evening of 22 September 2003. Statoil was fined for corruption from the Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime. Despite the seriousness of the case and the weakening of the name of Statoil, Fjell was according to the media given a compensation between NOK 7.5 and 10 million. In addition he sued Statoil with demands for early pension from 60 years equal to 66% of his wage. Statoil denied this agreement, though it was mentioned in the press release at the time of Fjells departure. In December 2005 Fjell won the court case, and he can expect payments from Statoil up to about NOK 40 million.

History =Early settlement= Brazilians came to the UK from the 1980s onwards to study, but once they arrived some discovered that the major cities (in particular London's) ethnic and cultural diversity offered more professional opportunities. In part, this immigration of Brazilians to the UK is a consequence of the economic possibility of travel. =Contemporary history= Shrine to Jean Charles de Menezes outside Stockwell Underground Station The Brazilian community of the UK was brought into the global spotlight in 2005 as a result of the death of Jean Charles de Menezes. Menezes was a Brazilian national living and working in Tulse Hill, south London who on the morning of 22 July 2005 was misidentified as Hamdi Adus Isaac‚Äîone of the fugitives involved in the previous day's failed bombing attempts. This misidentification ultimately lead to a number of non-uniformed Metropolitan Police officers following Menezes into Stockwell tube station and onto a train, where he was shot in the head seven times. The \\"shoot to kill\\" policy had been put in place after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The inquest that resulted was followed worldwide including by Menezes's family in Gonzaga, Minas Gerais, who set up the \\"Justice4Jean\\" campaign. Demographics Brazilian nationals gaining British citizenship between 1997 and 2008. Red indicates through residence, green through marriage and purple grants of citizenship to children, blue is the total of all three. =Population= The 1991 Census recorded 9,301 Brazilian born people in the UK, and the 2001 Census recorded 15,215. In 2004, the Brazilian Consulate in London had 13,000 Brazilians registered as living in the UK. Office for National Statistics estimates suggest that there were 60,000 Brazilian-born people resident in the UK in 2009. The 2011 Census recorded 50,117 Brazilian- born residents in England, 453 in Wales, 1,194 in Scotland and 384 in Northern Ireland. The ONS estimates that in 2018, 87,000 people born in Brazil were living in the UK. Several older guesstimates of the Brazilian population in the UK in the mid-2000s put the number at around 200,000. The discrepancy between official and unofficial population estimates has also been observed in studies of Brazilians in the United States. It has been suggested that the discrepancy is due to Brazilians overstaying their visas, or only seeing their stays as temporary, and therefore not participating in surveys or censuses. The Brazilian consulate in London estimated that in 2015, there were 120,000 Brazilians in the UK. =Spread and distribution= The majority of Brazilians in the UK reside in and around London. The 2001 Census showed that 8,000 people born in Brazil were residing in the capital, however in the same year other estimates suggested that were that between 15,000 and 50,000 Brazilians in London. In 2005, the BBC stated that the number of Londoners of Brazilian origin was approximately 60,000. Community groups estimated in 2007 that between 130,000 and 160,000 Brazilians were likely to be living in the London area. Within London, some 30,000 Brazilians were thought to reside in the Borough of Brent. Stockwell, south London is also home to a sizeable Brazilian community that lives alongside the UK's single largest Portuguese community in 'Little Portugal'. Bayswater in the City of Westminster has long been referred to as 'Brazilwater', indicating their heavy presence in the area. Besides the Brazilian community in London, there are numerous other locations in England with Brazilian populations. It is estimated that some 20,000 Brazilians reside in the Midlands (the majority in Birmingham), while some 15,000 Brazilians are thought to live in the county of Norfolk in East Anglia (most of these in King's Lynn and Norwich). The coastal town of Brighton was home to an estimated 10,000 Brazilians in 2005. 10,000 individuals of Brazilian origin also live in the Greater Manchester/Liverpool Urban Area. =Religion= Brazil is the world's largest Catholic nation, 68% adhere to the faith while 19% of Brazilians follow Protestantism. The largest Brazilian church in the UK is Universal Church of the Kingdom of God has temples in London and Birmingham. This church has been embroiled in scandals and accusations for over a decade, also in 2000 a Brazilian Christian evangelical sect bought London radio station Liberty Radio (previously owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed). This purchase was surrounded by controversy largely due to the stations large established audience that could be influenced by the alleged corrupt church, which tells its followers that \\"diseases are caused by demons and prayer can rid them of debt\\". There are some 30 Brazilian evangelical churches in London. Further, many other denominations has a strong representation of Brazilians' communities in the UK including some special meetings in Portuguese language in the IPDA Igreja Pentecostal Deus e Amor-Pentecostal Church God is Love, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehova's Witnesses, Kardecists and others. There is a Brazilian Chaplaincy in East London, set up by the Catholic Church and run by Brazilian priests, who conduct mass in Portuguese to hundreds of Brazilians at weekends. Culture and community =Business and economics= According to analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research based on Labour Force Survey data for 2000 to 2004, 57.4 per cent of Brazilian-born immigrants arriving in the UK in 1990 or after were employed (as opposed to studying, unemployed or inactive), with 80.7 per cent arriving before 1990 employed. Despite being relatively well educated, the majority of Brazilian immigrants to the UK have taken up professions that differ greatly from their previous careers in Brazil. The majority of Brazilian-born migrants to the UK choose jobs that are for the most part unskilled and low-paid; the reasons behind this include restrictions imposed by their immigration status and lack or limited knowledge of the English language. This has also been witnessed in the Brazilian diaspora in United States. A study conducted by Queen Mary, University of London revealed the most common jobs taken up by Brazilian immigrants in London. 32 per cent of individuals surveyed were involved in the cleaning industry, 26 per cent in hotel work and catering, 13 per cent in other 'services'. 10 per cent worked as couriers, 9 per cent in the construction industry, 3 per cent as au pairs or baby sitters. 6 per cent of those surveyed choose not to answer, while 1 per cent told of unemployment. Work and employment is an extremely important aspect for Brazilians in the UK, especially first-generation immigrants ‚Äì many of whom came to the UK for the sole reason of seeking employment. In the same study, 25 per cent of respondents said they came to the UK to work and/or study, while 24.3 per cent claimed to have come for work and to save money either to be able to permanently settle in the UK or to send to family back in Brazil. A large number of Brazilian-owned businesses have sprung up in the UK over recent decades. They include personal care, counselling, solicitors and lawyers that provide services in Portuguese, baby sitting, private cleaning, removals and transportation, travel agencies, private functions, money transfer, accommodation, as well as shops selling Brazilian clothing, food and drink, alongside numerous cafes and restaurants. 'Made in Brasil', a Brazilian bar in Camden Town =Media= Television =Rede Record= The Brazilian television channel Rede Record can be found on Sky channel 801, and Record Radio can be found on 0206. =Creature Comforts= The 1989 animated short films produced by the Aardman Animations gives a humorous take on the voices of the British public spoken by animals.

Community newspapers and magazines There are also many newspapers throughout the UK that cater specifically for the Brazilian British community. br@sil.net is a physical and online magazine that is concerned with topics from Brazil as well as covering information about the Brazilian British community. Not√≠cias em Portugu√™s is another UK-based fortnightly newspaper covering Brazilian and Portuguese-speaking community. Jungle Drums is a monthly magazine with content in Portuguese and English aimed primarily at the younger generations of the Brazilian British community. There are articles on Brazilian popular culture, society and politics, plus comparisons between life in the UK and Brazil. Leros and Revista Real are the names of two other monthly magazines read by the Brazilian British population, while Oi Londres is aimed specifically at Brazilians in the capital who are seeking information on immigration, employment opportunities and general news pieces. BrasUkas, To Em Londres, and VerdeAmarelas are Brazilians portals for people looking for jobs and opportunities in London as well as providing information for people who wish to move to or study in London. They also offer free classifieds sections that allow the Portuguese-speaking community to post advertisements for their businesses, job opportunities and property for sale. An investigation conducted by the International Organization for Migration in 2005 found that in terms of newspaper readership, 67% of Brazilian British respondents stated that they prefer to read UK newspapers. Magazine readership differed completely, where 51% of respondents said they favoured Brazilian publications in the UK over general UK publications and even Brazilian publications from Brazil. Brazilian associations =ABEP- UK‚ÄîAssociation of Brazilian Postgraduate Students and Researchers in the United Kingdom= The Brazilian Association of Postgraduate Students and Researchers in the United Kingdom is a civil, nonprofit association based in London that brings together its members (Brazilian postgraduate students and researchers residing in the United Kingdom). ABEP-UK promotes the integration of its members and organises conferences and meetings within the academic community. =Anglo-Brazilian Society= The Anglo-Brazilian Society is a UK registered charity with a focus on promoting the Brazilian culture by means of exhibitions and cultural demonstrations, as well as supporting charitable activities related to Brazil. =Music and dance= A Brazilian festival in March 2009, Golborne Road, Notting Hill The vibrant emerging Brazilian community in the capital has in a short time been influential in shaping the face of London and its residents. The culture and music of Brazil has had a significant impact in the UK, most evidently as previously stated in London. Numerous bars, clubs and other late nite venues are across the city, including the Guanabara Bar in Holborn, London. Many Brazilian acts perform in the Carnaval del Pueblo, Europe's largest celebration of Latin American culture, held in Burgess Park, London. There is also an annual festival celebrating Brazilian culture in the Golborne Road area that was most recently held in 2009. Brazilians have also participated in the Notting Hill Carnival and the Sadler's Wells Brazilian Carnival. A major three month event called 'Festival Brazil' is planned to take place between June and September 2010. Despite this, the single largest celebration of Brazilian culture in the UK is, in fact, held in Liverpool, Brazilica Festival has been held annually since 2008 when the city was European Capital of Culture and regularly attracts over 50,000 people. Samba, the world-renowned Brazilian dancing style alongside the other Latin American dances, Salsa have spread in popularity across the world. Dance schools teaching the art form include 'Paraiso School of Samba', and the 'London School of Samba'. The 2001 film The Girl from Rio starring Hugh Laurie makes reference to a samba school in London, in which a banker, while fed up with his day job, gives samba lessons at night. Besides the presence of traditional Brazilian music in the UK, numerous British-born Brazilians have made a significant impact on the British music scene. =Sport= Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy in Kensington, established by Roger Gracie The Brazilian community in the UK has established many sporting groups including a number of Football, Futsal and Footvolley teams (the latter two of which are sports that originate in Brazil). This alongside schools for the Brazilian sports of Jiu- Jitsu and Capoeira. There are some Brazilian-organized teams that play in English leagues at amateur-level including the Brazilian Football Club of London. Helvecia, and Kickers are also among some of the teams established by the Brazilian British community who compete in the FA Futsal League. The Brazilian sport of Footvolley also now has a presence in the UK, and there is an England national team that has competed in places such as Brighton and Margate as well as abroad in France, Spain and Portugal. Capoeira is an Afro- Brazilian art form that combines elements of dance, sport and martial art.

The accident happened on 3 November 1924 to the 4.40 pm Liverpool express travelling to Blackpool at 5.46 pm. When the tyre failed, the train was moving at about , and the train derailed at a crossing, then hit a bridge, closely followed by the Warton signal box. The building was completely demolished and coals from the grate ignited a carriage. The engine toppled over together with two of the carriages. Investigation Colonel Pringle of the Railway Inspectorate found part of the broken tyre away in a field, the left-hand leading wheel of the engine having broken. The tread had broken from a large internal blow hole. The defect probably formed during the steel casting operation, and became critical as the tread was worn away. The tyre had been made in 1920, and had run over before failure. All the other wheels from the same batch were removed from service and broken up, but without finding any cavities in the treads. Pringle also showed how tyre fractures had decreased over the years. In 1880, there were 1238 broken tyres, 577 ten years later and by 1900, the number had dropped to 234. The majority were found on wagons, but by 1920, there were only 20 wheel failures. The drop in failure rate was due to the introduction of the monobloc steel wheel and better inspection and maintenance methods.

It is traditionally the city's most prestigious business address. Colmore Row and its environs were designated a conservation area in 1971, which was extended twice in 1985. Colmore Row itself has 23 listed buildings, two listed at Grade I and two at Grade II*. History Colmore Row, shown as New Hall Lane, on William Westley's 1731 map of Birmingham.Grand Hotel in 1896. St. Philip's Cathedral is located on the street. Before this area of Birmingham was developed in the 18th century, Colmore Row was a country lane called New Hall Lane, connecting the roads from City centre to Dudley and West Bromwich and separating the farmlands of the New Hall Estate to the north from those of the Inge Estate to the south. Development of the south of the lane started with the building of St Philip's Church (now St Philip's Cathedral) in 1708. In 1746, a private Act of Parliament opened up the New Hall Estate to the north for development, with the first plots being let and developed from 1747 onwards. The road was renamed at this point, but initially only the stretch between Newhall Street and Livery Street was named Colmore Row (after the Colmore family, owners of the New Hall Estate). The stretch between Newhall Street and New Street was named Ann Street, after head of the family Ann Colmore, while the stretch north of Livery Street, originally called Bull Lane, became known as Monmouth Street. Ann Street disappeared as a name when the street was divided between Colmore Row and Victoria Square, when the latter was created (initially as Council House Square) in 1879. The original buildings of Colmore Row were the brick and stucco Georgian houses typical of the late 18th century. The 120 year leases on these properties started to expire in the 1840s and 1850s, and between 1869 and 1900 all were replaced by the late Victorian commercial premises that still give the street its predominant character. Colmore Row in the 1870s, showing the original Georgian terraces being replaced by Victorian commercial buildingsAfter the Second World War, Colmore Row was to have formed part of the extensive Inner Ring Road system planned by City Engineer Herbert Manzoni. This would have necessitated demolishing all of the buildings between Colmore Row and Waterloo Street, but fell victim to increasing land values and awareness of conservation issues in the 1970s. The plans for the street included widening it to a width of with a central reservation of in width. Ironically, the likelihood of forthcoming comprehensive redevelopment protected many of the buildings from being demolished to make way for office developments (see Colmore Business District), and today Colmore Row and the surrounding area has one of the most consistent 19th century streetscapes in Central Birmingham. In the 1980s, Barclays proposed a redevelopment of 55-73 Colmore Row. The scheme involved the demolition of the entire building except for the fa√ßades and the banking hall of the listed building. The local planning authority called for greater retention of the building structure as with other schemes in the area. The agents submitted multiple planning applications to put pressure on the planning department. As the planning department failed to come to a decision on two planning applications in their time periods, the bank took the case to a government department. Barclays and local planning authority failed to reach any deal in negotiations, which eventually broke down. The government saw that the retention of the fa√ßade was satisfactory as it allowed the economic reuse of the site. The decision left the development and design framework for the area in a weakened state as the building subject to the decision was deemed to be of less national importance in respect to its local importance. The use of fa√ßadism on the building has since been seen as successful following the addition of Mansard roofs providing additional floorspace. Transport Hub In addition to Snow Hill station, Colmore Row also hosts the city centre bus stops AB to AF - which together have the IATA location identifier code ZBC.

Berkenbrock was of German descent both sides and she worked on her farm while also teaching fellow children catechism and attending Mass on a frequent basis. Berkenbrock's beatification cause came to fruition with the beatification held on 20 October 2007. Life Albertina Berkenbrock was born in Imaru√≠ in Brazil on 11 April 1919 to the devout farmers Johann Hermann and Elisabeth Schm√∂ller as one of nine children. Her grandparents immigrated from Sch√∂ppingen to Brazil and brought with them their three children one of who was Johann Hermann. Berkenbrock was baptized on 25 May 1919 and received her Confirmation on 9 March 1925. On 16 August 1928 she made her First Communion which was an experience that she herself described as the most beautiful event in her entire life. Berkenbrock also fostered a special devotion to the Mother of God and to Saint Aloysius Gonzaga who was the patron saint of S√£o Lu√≠s. Her teachers praised her morals and her generous nature and she never retaliated against those that teased her or taunted her like her brothers sometimes did as siblings do. Maneco Palho√ßa, who worked for her father, tried to rape her on 15 June 1931. Berkenbrock searched for a bullock that ran off and came across Maneco who was loading beans into a cart; she asked if he had seen it and so Maneco pointed her in the wrong direction to a wooded area so he could attack her. The girl followed his directions and heard twigs cracking believing it was the bullock but was petrified to see Maneco behind her. Berkenbrock tried to fight back but her attacker realized that he would fail and she would point him out so grasped her hair and slit her throat with a knife. He tried to cover up his crime when he blamed it on Jo√£o Candinho and then fled but he was soon arrested after people suspected him; each time Maneco was taken near the girl's corpse the blood from her neck gushed as a sign he was the culprit. He confessed to his crime as well as two other previous murders. He was tried and convicted in which he was given a life sentence. In prison he admitted to his fellow prisoners that he murdered the girl because she resisted his rape attempts. Her remains were later relocated in 2002. Beatification The beatification process opened in Tubar√£o in an informative process that spanned from 30 December 1954 until its closure later in 2001; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process in Rome on 18 January 2002. The cause commenced on a formal level under Pope John Paul II on 2 October 2001 and Berkenbrock was titled as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. received the official Positio dossier from the postulation in 2002 for assessment. Theologians approved the cause on 26 September 2006 as did the C.C.S. on 21 November 2006 while Pope Benedict XVI approved that Berkenbrock was killed \\"in defensum castitatis\\" on 16 December 2006 and thus approved her beatification. Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf in Brazil on 20 October 2007. The current postulator for the cause is Dr. Paolo Vilotta.

The information about Kashpir Ganusov is scarce. It is difficult to tell what nationality he was or where he came from. We can only cautiously assume that Kashpir Ganusov was one of those craftsmen who had left the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the first half of the 16th century. According to the Moscow Cannon Yard documents and archives, Kashpir Ganusov was working at the court of Ivan the Terrible in 1550s. In 1554, the cannon yard produced a huge bell weighing 19,657 kg, which would later receive the name of Lebed‚Äô (–õ–µ–±–µ–¥—å, or \\"swan\\"). This bell didn't survive to this day, but we only know of one bell maker in Moscow of that time, who could have cast it. Based on this, Kashpir Ganusov is considered the maker of this bell (or his predecessor, whose name is unknown). At a certain point in time, Kashpir Ganusov moved his activities to Smolensk. According to some documents of the 19th century, there were quite a few arquebuses along the fortress walls of Smolensk with Ganusov's name on them (and his apprentices‚Äô names, as well). One of the most famous pieces of ammunition made by Kashpir Ganusov is an arquebus named Ostraya Panna (–û—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—è –ü–∞–Ω–Ω–∞), then located at the Government Warehouse (–ö–∞–∑—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞–º–±–∞—Ä) in Smolensk. It weighed 185 poods (3,030 kg). The engraving on this arquebus says that it was made by Kashpir Ganusov in the summer of 1564. There are no other known arquebuses with Ganusov's name on them, but some of them have the name of his most famous apprentice ‚Äì Andrei Chokhov. It happened so that Chokhov had to recast his teacher's creation‚Äîthe Lebed‚Äô bell‚Äîafter Devlet I Giray‚Äôs raid on Moscow in 1571. It is this very bell that is pictured on the so-called Kremlenagrad‚Äîthe first detailed map of the Moscow Kremlin. We also know about other Ganusov's apprentices, such as Bogdan Andreytokhov, Kuzmin Pervoy, Nikita Tupitsyn and Yuri Bochkaryov, who worked in Moscow between the second half of the 16th century and early 17th century. Semyon Dubinin, Ganusov's apprentice in Smolensk, would later move to Pskov. So far, we know nothing about Kashpir Ganusov since he was last mentioned in a document of the late 1560s.

It dates to the early Neolithic, about 4800 BC. Along with the Tumulus of Bougon and Locmariaquer megaliths, also located in Great West France, it is one of the earliest megalithic monuments in Europe and one of the oldest man-made structures in the world. It is also remarkable for the presence of megalithic art. History One of the chambers, exposed by 20th century quarrying Artistic reconstruction of the cairn, c. 4000 BC =Dates= Radiocarbon dates indicate that the first phase of the monument was erected between 4850 and 4250 BC, and the second phase between 4450 and 4000 BC. =Secondary use= Pottery found in and around the monument indicates that it underwent a period of reuse in the Bronze Age, in the 3rd millennium BC. =Recognition as an ancient monument= The cairn was first mapped in 1807, in the context of the Napoleonic cadaster. Its first scientific recognition took place in the context of an academic congress in Morlaix in 1850, when it was classified as a tumulus. =Quarry damage= Privately owned until the 1950s, the cairn was used as a quarry for paving stones. This activity, which threatened to destroy the monument, was only halted after the discovery of several of its chambers in the 1950s. The local community then took control of the site. =Restoration and excavation= The cairn was restored between 1954 and 1968. At the same time, vegetation was removed from the mound and systematic excavation took place in and around the monument. The monument One of the passages =The mound= The Cairn of Barnenez Today, the Barnenez cairn is 72 m long, up to 25 m wide and over 8 m high. It is built of 13,000 to 14,000 tons of stone. It contains 11 chambers entered by separate passages. The mound has steep facades and a stepped profile. Several internal walls either represent earlier facades or served the stability of the structure. The cairn consists of relatively small blocks of stone, with only the chambers being truly megalithic in character. The monument overlooks the Bay of Morlaix, probably a fertile coastal plain at the time of its erection. Simplified plan. Cairn 1 marked in yellow, Cairn 2 in green. =Construction phases= The monument is the result of at least two phases of building. Cairn 1, before 4500 BC In a first phase, a slightly trapezoidal mound of 32 m by 9 to 13 m was erected. It contained 5 chambers and was surrounded by a double kerb. The first phase favoured the use of dolerite. Cairn 2, c. 4200 ‚Äì c. 3900 BC In a second phase, an extension with six further chambers was added in the west. At the same time, Cairn 1 was enveloped in a wider and taller structure; its passages had to be extended. More granite was used in this phase. =The chambers= The 11 chambers of the Barnenez cairn are of the type known as Dolmen √† couloir in French archaeological terminology. The term translates roughly as \\"passage grave\\". They are built of large slabs of slate and granite. Originally, all the chambers were entirely enclosed by the mound. The fact that several of them are partially exposed now is the result of modern quarrying. Each of the 11 chambers is reached from the southeast via a long narrow passage (7‚Äì12 m long). They are arranged parallel to each other. Shapes and construction techniques differ slightly. In nine cases, narrow passages lead to corbelled chambers. Normally, the corbel vault rests on orthostats, in one chamber it actually sits on the ground, forming a true tholos. The passages have slab- built or dry stone walls and are covered with slabs. One of the chambers has a dry-stone vaulted ante-chamber. Examples of the carved symbols = Logistics = One cubic metre of the Barnenez cairn contains 1,500 kg of stone. It is estimated that the quarrying, fashioning, transport and construction of such an amount represents about four work days for a single worker (assuming a 10-hour day). The original monument, Cairn 1, had a volume of about 2,000 cubic metres; it is built of 1,000 tons of granite and 3,000 tons of dolerite. It would thus have required 15,000 to 20,000 working days; in other words, it would have taken 200 workers three months to erect Cairn 1 alone. In its final form, the Barnenez mound is nearly three times as big as the first phase. Reproduction of the \\"Dolmen Goddess\\" of Barnenez =Engraved symbols= Engraved symbols occur in several of the chambers and passages. They depict bows, axes, wave symbols or snakes and a repeated U-shaped sign. One of the carved slabs is in secondary use was originally part of a different structure, an interesting parallel to the situation in several other such monuments, including Gavrinis. The symbols on the engraved blocks resemble those found in other megalithic monuments in Brittany; in broader terms they belong to the cultural phenomenon described as megalithic art. One of the recurring symbols is sometimes interpreted as an anthropomorphic depiction (the so-called \\"Dolmen Goddess\\"). =Finds= Material from the original period of use Only Cairn 2, namely chambers A, C and D, contained Neolithic finds at the time of excavation. They included pottery, polished stone axes (of dolerite), flint blades and arrowheads. Bronze Age pottery Pottery shards found outside the monument indicate that it was reused in the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC). A copper dagger and a barbed arrowhead are of Chalcolithic date. Comparable monuments Similar, possibly contemporary, monuments are known at 22 other locations in France and on Jersey. Breton examples are Larcuste-Colpo, Le Bono, Petit Mont, Ty-Floc¬¥h, Gavrinis, √éle Carn, Ploudalm√©zeau and Guennoc (I¬¥ile Gaignoc ‚Äì sometimes spelt Gu√©nioc) off the shore at Land√©da. Those located on islands are generally better preserved. Chamber 3 B at Guennoc contains a small standing stone near the entrance. Exhibition An exhibition in the modern entrance building explains the results of scientific excavation and displays some objects from the site.

Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force The squadron was formed on 3 April 1933 as part of the Fleet Air Arm, with the promotion of No. 401 Flight to squadron status. The squadron was equipped with the Fairey Flycatcher and Hawker Nimrod aboard . The Flycatchers were replaced in 1934 by the Hawker Osprey and the Nimrods were retired in 1936. The squadron was re-equipped with the Blackburn Skua and Gloster Gladiator in 1939 just before the squadron was transferred to the Admiralty.  Second World War  In January 1940, 801 NAS was based at RNAS Donibristle with the Blackburn Skua, playing a key role in the early part of the war with operations in Norway while deploying from the aircraft carrier . In September, 801 Squadron embarked on for raids on the northerly parts of the Norwegian coast. Following an attack on Trondheim on 22 September, Skua L2942 piloted by Sub-Lieutenant Bernard Wigginton with Leading Aircraftman Kenneth King as his gunner, was unable to find their carrier and crash landed in neutral Sweden. In 1943 880 Naval Air Squadron formed the 30 Naval Fighter Wing on . In June 1945, naval fighter wings were reformed as carrier groups with 801 NAS, 828 NAS, 880 NAS and 1771 NAS becoming the 8th Carrier Air Group. In August 1941 they re-equipped with Sea Hurricanes at RNAS Yeovilton, Captain George Clifton Baldwin commanded the station from 1966-1968) The squadron deployed to the Mediterranean aboard , then to . During this deployment 801 NAS claimed thirteen enemy aircraft of various types, for the loss of three Hurricanes and four Fulmars. Two of the Fulmars were brought down by friendly fire.  Korean War  In March 1951, 801 NAS received Hawker Sea Furys and the squadron saw active service during the Korean War flying from . Glory was deployed in theatre from 3 April 1951 to 30 September 1951 and from 8 November 1952 to the Korean Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953. 801 NAS was embarked on the second tour of duty. Sea Furies could be armed with either two bombs or four rockets and drop tanks in both cases. The aircraft were mainly used in the ground attack role armed with bombs and rockets, but they were also engaged in air-to-air combat with the much faster MiG-15. A Sea Fury FB.11 launches from in 1951 The squadron suffered seven casualties.  1960s to 1980s  On 18 March 1962, 801 squadron was reformed at Lossiemouth in the strike role with Buccaneers. In July 1962 they embarked 10 aircraft in for the Far East. The squadron subsequently received the 1967 Boyd Trophy, an annual award for the best squadron in the Fleet Air Arm, for its efforts in bringing the Buccaneer into service. 801 transferred to with 7 aircraft in 1968 for a further spell in Eastern waters. In March 1969 the ship returned home to spend the next year in Home and Mediterranean waters. The squadron eventually disbanded at Lossiemouth on 21 July 1970. In January 1981 the squadron re-equipped with the Sea Harrier FRS.1 at RNAS Yeovilton.  Falklands War  The squadron operated the Sea Harrier equipped with Blue Fox radars aboard during the Falklands War.Norton-Taylor, Richard.

Lieutenant Commander Kent and Flight Lieutenant Mortimer were both Mentioned in Despatches. Lt Curtis was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches  1982 to 2000s  In March 1997, 801 NAS was deployed onboard HMS Illustrious as part of the Carrier Task Group assigned to the Armilla patrol when it took part in Operation Jural, enforcing the 'no fly' zone over southern Iraq. Equipped with FA2 Sea Harriers, the Squadron operated alongside GR7 Harriers from No.1 Squadron RAF whom had joined them on the carrier for a month of combined exercises and operations. Between 7-12 March, the Harriers flew 28 sorties (18 over Iraqi territory).  Decommissioning  Sea Harrier of 801 NAS On Tuesday 28 March 2006 a ceremony was held at RNAS Yeovilton, with Commander A J W Rae as the last Sea Harrier squadron commanding officer, to mark the withdrawal from service of the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier FA2s. The final Sea Harrier was withdrawn from service on 31 March 2006 at RNAS Yeovilton and the squadron disbanded. Prior to decommissioning, all aircraft adopted the omega symbol on their tail-fin in recognition of 801 NAS being the last operators of an all-British fixed-wing fighter aircraft. This harks back to the use of this symbol by 892 Naval Air Squadron, whose McDonnell Douglas Phantom FG.1s were the last conventional fixed-wing aircraft used by the Fleet Air Arm. 801 NAS was due to recommission in March 2007, under the command of Commander K Seymour, to operate the Harrier GR7 and GR9 from RAF Cottesmore. However, due to lack of manpower all former 801 and 800 NAS (their sister squadron) personnel formed a \\"Naval Strike Wing\\" within RAF Cottesmore, thus severing all remaining ties to their former home at RNAS Yeovilton. On 1 April 2010, Naval Strike Wing reverted to the identity of 800 Naval Air Squadron.

A revote was held in three polling stations in Belgrade on 18 May 2008 due to irregularities in the electoral process.B92 - News - Politics - Revote ongoing in six polling stations Negotiations between the ruling parties, the President's DS and the Premier's DSS, were trying to enact a compromise on the date of the election. Tadiƒá's Democratic Party wanted to respect the constitutional law, wanting to schedule the election by the end of year and hold it in March 2008, which is DSS's demand because of the solution of the status of Kosovo. G17 Plus wanted the Mayors and municipal Presidents to be elected directly as in the past, but the Democratic Party wanted them to be elected by the local parliaments. Four laws necessary for the local elections (on territorial organisation, the capital, local elections and local self- government) were passed before the elections. Ever since the death of Belgrade Mayor Nenad Bogdanoviƒá the Serbian Radical Party has demanded parliamentary Speaker Oliver Dulic to schedule a Mayoral election, however Duliƒá said that the Constitutional Law mandated him to schedule general local elections simultaneously. The new Law of Belgrade foresaw a Mayor elected from the City Parliament. In areas geographically comprising Sand≈æak, the Sand≈æak Democratic Party and Democratic Party ran in local elections together. The European Coalition of DS, G17+ and SPO ran in all Municipalities and Cities, except in Ni≈°, where G17+ had been part of ruling coalition for the last years and where DS was running against them.B92 - News - Politics - DS, G17 Plus on separate lists in Ni≈° The \\"Serb List\\" political of SRS, DSS, NS, SPS and several nationalist civic groups and organizations had been formed and ran in most of Vojvodina locally.

Photo of \\"American Beauty\\" Boeing B-29-45-BW Superfortress 42-24703 of the 792d Bomb Squadron 468th Bomb Wing, Kalaikunda AB, India The 468th Bombardment Group was a World War II United States Army Air Forces combat organization. The unit served primarily in the Pacific Ocean theater and China Burma India Theater of World War II as part of Twentieth Air Force. The 468th Bomb Group's aircraft engaged in very heavy bombardment Boeing B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan. After its reassignment to the Mariana Islands in 1945, its aircraft were identified by a \\"I\\" and a triangle painted on the tail. It was inactivated on 31 March 1946. History The unit was established in May 1943 at Smoky Hill Army Airfield, Kansas as a B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bombardment Group. The 468th was one of the four initial operational groups of the 58th Bombardment Wing, the first operational B-29 wing programmed for overseas deployment into combat. When established, the group was assigned four bomb squadrons (792d, 793d, 794th and 795th), all being newly constituted. Initially assigned a mixture of eight B-26 Marauders, twelve B-17 Flying Fortresses and four YB-29 preproduction Superfortresses, for training. Initial production B-29 aircraft received were in a constant state of being operationally ready or in a maintenance status for modification by Boeing technicians. Crews began to arrive in November 1943, but very few bombers were ready to receive them. At that time, there was only one Superfortress for every twelve crews, and most crews had to train on the Martin B-26 Marauders or Boeing B-17 Fortresses. The program was seriously hampered by the need to work in the open air in inclement weather, by delays in acquiring the necessary tools and support equipment, and by the USAAF's general lack of experience with the B-29. A crash program was initiated by General Hap Arnold, head of the Army Air Forces to put things in order. The mechanics often had to work outdoors in freezing weather, since the hangars were not large enough to accommodate the B-29s. As a result of superhuman efforts on the part of all concerned, 150 B-29s had been handed over to the 58th Bomb Wing by 15 April 1944. In March/April 1944 as each airplane was made combat-ready, its flight crew and crew chief departed for overseas; their initial destination in the China-Burma-India (CBI) theater. One B-29 passed through England in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence about the intended theatre of action of the B-29, although the B-29 was never intended for use in the European theatre. In India, the 58th Wing came under the XX Bomber Command, the 468th Bomb Group arriving at Kharagpur Airfield on 13 April. However overheated engines plagued the B-29s in India. The entire B-29 fleet had to be grounded en route until the cause was found. My mid-May the B-29s were again ready. The initial mission of the 468th in India was to use their aircraft to haul bombs, fuel, ammunition and spare parts 1,200 miles to its advanced base at Field A-7, Pengshan, Szechwan Province, China. Six round trips were necessary to deliver enough fuel for one airplane to mount a combat mission from China ‚Äì an impractical logistics concept for an aerial campaign, particularly with an airplane plagued with an unreliable engine. On 5 June 1944, the 468th flew its first operational mission from Kharagpur against railroad yards at Bangkok, Thailand. Ten days later, flying from field A-7 (Pengshan Airfield), the group bombed the Imperial Iron & Steel Works, Yawata, Japan ‚Äì the opening of the B-29 phase of the Air Offensive against Japan. By late 1944, it established the best operational record of the four B-29 groups then in combat, for which Headquarters XX Bomber Command awarded it General Billy Mitchell's personal sailing burgee and authorized it to adopt the name \\"The General Billy Mitchell Group,\\" a name requiring outstanding performance of duty. Within a year, it participated in eight campaigns and earned three Distinguished Unit Citations. From June 1944 until May 1945, operating at maximum range, the 468th conducted aerial reconnaissance and bombardment operations from India and China against Japanese targets in Japan, Manchuria, China, Taiwan, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, Singapore and Sumatra. Sixteen-hour combat missions were common; the longest 21. Weather, terrain and the enemy were equally unforgiving. The B-29 was still being \\"invented\\" and its operational tactics had to be proved while the airplane was being de-bugged in the face of the enemy. In July 1944, the United States Marines invaded the Mariana Islands and as soon as West Field, Tinian, was readied in May 1945, the India-based B-29s were again designated the 58th Bombardment Wing and flew to West Field and continued the air offensive against Japan; operating as part of the new XXI Bomber Command. Upon arrival the group's personnel were engaged in Quonset hut construction. By the end of April most personnel were able to move into the huts from the initial tents which they were assigned on arrival. The group began operations in May 1944 against targets located in the Japanese Home Islands. The group flew many missions against strategic objectives in Japan; on numerous raids, made its attacks in daylight and from high altitude. In October 1944 shortages in aircraft and equipment led to the 795th Bomb Squadron being inactivated, with its personnel being consolidated into other group squadrons. The 468th flew its last combat mission from Tinian on 15 August 1945. It had played a vital role in the sudden, almost overnight development of Twentieth Air Force strength and had fought from beginning to end in the Pacific Air Offensive. After V-J Day, the 497th dropped supplies to Allied prisoners, participated in show-of-force missions, and flew over Japan to evaluate bombardment damage. On 2 September 1945, Major General Curtis LeMay had the group lead the 20th Air Forces show of force over the USS Missouri during the Japanese surrender ceremonies. As part of the 20th Air Force, it has participated in the first use of air power to end a major conflict without having to fight one's way into the enemy homeland. In December 1945 the unit returned to the United States; initially being assigned to Continental Air Forces's (CAF) Second Air Force at Fort Worth Army Airfield, Texas. At Fort Worth, the 512th Bombardment Squadron joined the group; it previously being a Fifteenth Air Force B-24 Liberator squadron based in Italy, having been returned to the United States in May and was undergoing B-29 Very Heavy Bomber upgrade training in Nebraska when its former assigned group, the 376th Bombardment Group, was inactivated. In January 1946, the group was reassigned the CAF Fourth Air Force at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico; then being transferred to the new Strategic Air Command on 21 March 1946, being one of SAC's initial bombardment groups. Demobilization, however, was in full swing and the group turned in its aircraft and was inactivated on 31 March. =Lineage= * Constituted as 468th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 19 May 1943 : Activated on 1 August 1943 : Redesignated 468th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) in November 1943 : Inactivated on 31 March 1946. =Assignments= * 58th Bombardment Wing, 1 August 1943 ‚Äì 12 October 1944 * XX Bomber Command, 13 October 1944 ‚Äì 7 February 1945 * 58th Bombardment Wing, 8 February-15 November 1945 * Continental Air Forces, 1 December 1945 * Strategic Air Command, 21‚Äì31 March 1946 =Components= * 512th Bombardment Squadron 10 November 1945 ‚Äì 26 March 1946 * 791st Bombardment Squadron, 7‚Äì31 Mar 1946 * 792d Bombardment Squadron 1 August 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * 793d Bombardment Squadron 1 August 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * 794th Bombardment Squadron 1 August 1943 ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * 795th Bombardment Squadron 1 August 1943 ‚Äì 12 October 1944 * 13th Bombardment Maintenance Squadron * 14th Bombardment Maintenance Squadron * 15th Bombardment Maintenance Squadron * 16th Bombardment Maintenance Squadron * 14th Photographic Laboratory Squadron =Stations= * Smoky Hill AAFld, KS 1 August 1943 ‚Äì 12 March 1944 * Kharagpur Airfield, India, 13 April 1944 ‚Äì 24 February 1945 : Pengshan Airfield (A-7), China designated as forward staging base. * West Field, Tinian, Mariana Islands 6 April ‚Äì 15 November 1945 * Ft Worth AAFld, TX 1 December 1945 * Roswell AAFld, NM 12 January ‚Äì 31 March 1946 =Aircraft flown= * B-26 Marauder, 1943‚Äì1944 (Training Only) * B-17 Flying Fortress, 1943‚Äì1944 (Training Only) * Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 1944‚Äì1946 References * Maurer, Maurer (1983).

It spans over 205 acres of land near the Mississippi river at the northwest edge of the state of Illinois in the United States. In 1974, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places list. The historical site is under the provision of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, a governmental agency founded in 1985 for the maintaining of historical sites within the state. In the 1990s, the site underwent a restoration project that aimed to return its appearance to its original condition.\\"The Albany Mounds.\\" Albany Mounds Historic Site. Web. 10 Dec. 2015. Background Considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in the state of Illinois, the site aims to exist as \\"an interpretive center for the history of the Hopewellian culture of more than 2000 years ago.\\" It is the largest Hopewell Native American site in the state, and contains evidence of human activity that stretches over 10,000 years in length from the present day. Historically comprising ninety-six mounds, the site today consists of a remaining forty-seven mounds, eight of which are in poor condition as a result of natural and human processes. The mounds are up to twelve feet high, and were constructed as burial sites for the dead. Features of the historical site in addition to many of the original two-thousand-year-old mounds, include several recreation trails, a parking lot, picnic area, and restrooms. Visitors can easily witness the wildlife, such as deer and eagles, that inhabit the area. Over two miles of trail encompass the site, featuring interpretive signs signifying the local flora. Archaeological significance The archaeological area is older than the more famous Cahokia site in the southern part of the state. The Mounds date back to the Middle Woodland Period, commonly referred to as the Hopewell period. This period characterized critical changes in the lifestyles of native peoples in the New World. The Middle Woodland period is considered to have persisted between 200 BCE and 300 CE. It was during this period that farming techniques began to be implanted, alongside older hunting activities. This was a period in which technological and agricultural innovation was burgeoning, leading up to the more complex social structuring of the Mississippian cultures several centuries later. The Albany mounds site was founded by an Indigenous peoples that inhabited the area over 2000 years ago. Little can be said for certain about the Hopewell people, which is a term that does not refer to a tribe but rather is an umbrella term for a people that inhabited this period of anthropological activity. Burial artifacts found at the site show materials not native to the area which \\"indicate the existence of trading networks with Native Americans from other areas.\\" The Hopewell people of Illinois constructed large mounds in the land for death and burial ceremonies. These erected structures of raised earth were used as final burying places, and were constructed uniformly, using similar techniques but ranging in size. The historic site's significance lies in the amount of information one can gather about the peoples that inhabited the area millennia ago. Nineteenth and twentieth century excavations of the mounds revealed interesting burial practices on the part of the Hopewell peoples. Stone and wood crypts contained artifacts such as intricate bead jewelry, pottery and mica plates. These native peoples preferred to build their villages near rivers, accounting for the site's location on the eastern side of the Mississippi river. The drainage that when the river would flood provided the Hopewell with resources that allowed the settlements to prosper for centuries. The large concentrations of pipe stone and platform pipe artifacts in the area suggests that the site was an important \\"pipe manufacturing center.\\" Evidence of waning culture corresponded to around 350 CE, and the mounds were left deserted until excavations and preservation efforts began in the nineteenth century.

As a neighbourhood, it covers a small area but its importance is primarily because of the police station. Etymology Shyampukur, like its neighbour Shyambazar, is likely to have been named in honour of Shyam Rai (or Gobinda), the attendant of the goddess Kali, the household deity of the Basaks, who with the Setts were amongst the first to have settled in Sutanuti, after having cleared the jungles.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, p. 291, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

After the Battle of Plassey, in 1757, the British settled down to more organised administration in Kolkata. One of the developments was the police station, which also provided civic facilities. The Police Commissioner doubled as Municipal Chairman till 1888. Shyampukur was one of the twenty-five police section houses in 1888.

George Ensor, representing the Church Missionary Society (CMS), which followed the Anglican traditions of the Church of England. In 1874 he was replaced by the Revd H Burnside at Nagasaki. The same year the CMS mission was expanded to include Revd C F Warren at Osaka, Revd Philip Fyson at Yokohama, Revd J Piper at Tokyo (Yedo), Revd H Evington at Niigata and Revd W Dening at Hokkaido. Revd H Maundrell joined the Japan mission in 1875 and served at Nagasaki. Revd John Batchelor was a missionary to the Ainu people of Hokkaido from 1877 to 1941.

He united various Anglican missionary efforts into one national church the Nippon Sei Ko Kai or Anglican-Episcopal Church in Japan, and went on in 1874 to establish Rikkyo University. After the Meiji Restoration, significant new legislation relating to the freedom of religion was introduced in 1871, facilitating in September 1873, the arrival in Tokyo of Rev. Alexander Croft Shaw and the Rev. W. Ball Wright, the first missionaries sent to Japan by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.

He promptly opened a clinic in nearby Soko-ji, another Buddhist temple. However, it was ordered to close. He did not open another clinic for the next four years, instead devoting his time to his study of the Japanese language. An Ukiyo-e print of Sawamura Tanosuke III in one of his roles In May 1863, he opened another clinic in the Yokohama Foreign Settlement, specialized in optometry, but providing a wide range of medical services, including surgery. At this clinic, he gained fame for amputating the feet of the famous Kabuki actor, Sawamura Tanosuke III, due to gangrene. In November of that same year, Hepburn opened his second clinic, and he and his wife Clara opened a school which taught a number of high-profile individuals: Hayashi Tadasu, Takahashi Korekiyo, and Masuda Takashi, among others. Clara taught English; Hepburn taught medical science. Later, in 1867, Hepburn would publish the results of his long study of Japanese, a Japanese-English dictionary. This dictionary contained Hepburn romanization, which is still the most common form of Romaji. By 1887, the Hepburn Academy, which had merged with a number of other missionary projects, had become Meiji Gakuin University of Shirokane. Hepburn was the school's first president. Famed poet and novelist, T≈çson Shimazaki, was a member of the first graduating class and wrote the school song.  Divie Bethune McCartee  Divie Bethune McCartee was a notable Presbyterian Christian missionary to visit Japan in 1861‚Äì1862. His gospel tract translated into the Japanese language was among the first Protestant literature in Japan. In 1865 McCartee moved back to Ningbo, China, but others have followed in his footsteps. The Japanese responded favorably to the gospel in the late 19th century when Japan re-opened its doors to the West. However, this was followed by renewed suspicion and rejection of Christian teaching. The growth of Protestantism was slowed dramatically in the early 20th century because of pressure caused by criticism and the influence of the military government.  Post-World War II  The post-World War II years have seen increasing activity by evangelicals, initially with American influence, and some growth occurred between 1945 and 1960.

Fossils of Carcinosoma are restricted to deposits of late Silurian (Late Llandovery to Early Pridoli) age. Classified as part of the family Carcinosomatidae, which the genus lends its name to, Carcinosoma contains seven species from North America and Great Britain. Carcinosomatid eurypterids had unusual proportions and features compared to other eurypterids, with a broad abdomen, thin and long tail and spined and forward- facing walking appendages. They were not as streamlined as other groups but had considerably more robust and well developed walking appendages. In Carcinosoma, these spined walking appendages are thought to have been used to create a trap to capture prey in. The telson (final segment of the body) of Carcinosoma appears to have possessed distinct segmentation, Carcinosoma is the only known eurypterid to possess this feature. At in length, the species C. punctatum is the largest carcinosomatoid eurypterid by far and is among the largest eurypterids overall, rivalling the large pterygotid eurypterids (such as Jaekelopterus) in size. Other species of the genus were considerably smaller, with most ranging from to in length.  Description  Reconstruction of C. newlini with coloration inferred by Kjellesvig-Waering (1958) Carcinosoma was among the largest eurypterids, with isolated fossil remains consisting of a long metastoma (a plate overlaying the coxae of the first six appendages) of the species C. punctatum indicating a full length of . Fossil prosomal appendages (appendages attached to the head) referred to the species could possibly increase this estimate to an overall length of around . This massive size makes C. punctatum the largest of all known carcinosomatoid eurypterids and it rivals the largest pterygotid eurypterids, such as the long Jaekelopterus, in size. Supplementary information Other species of Carcinosoma were smaller, most being in the range of to in length. Perhaps the most recognizable features of Carcinosoma are its spined appendages and its broad and flattened mesosoma (the first six segments of its abdomen). Carcinosomatid eurypterids such as Carcinosoma had less streamlined bodies than those of some other groups, notably the highly streamlined pterygotid eurypterids. In contrast, the walking legs of the carcinosomatids were in general more robust and better developed. Indeed, the walking legs (the second to fifth pair of appendages) were stout and strong and increased in size anteriorly, from the fifth to third pair of appendages, though the first pair of appendages were much shorter than the following pairs. As such, the second pair of walking legs were the longest. Each walking appendage possessed long and curved spines, often two such spines occurring per joint. These spines are one of the defining features of the carcinosomatid family, along with that the swimming legs have slightly elongated and expanded seventh and eighth podomeres (leg segments). The body of Carcinosoma was somewhat oddly proportioned in comparison to other eurypterids, though similar to that of related carcinosomatids (particularly Eusarcana). The preabdomen (frontal part of the body) was broad and ovally shaped whilst the postabdomen (the posterior part of the body) was narrow and cylindrical. The prosoma (head) was subtriangular in shape with the small compound eyes placed at the front. The metasoma of Carcinosoma was covered in fine and elongated scales and was quite flat, a feature which separates the genus from Eusarcana where the metasoma was almost cylindrical. = Color = A well-preserved specimen of C. newlini, specimen number 502 in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History (collected in the Kokomo Formation of Indiana), preserves the integument in enough detail to determine the coloration C. newlini would have possessed in life. By surveying the distribution of fossilized pigment cells and comparing them with those of modern scorpions, scientists were able to see the pattern and specific colors C. newlini would have possessed in life. Overall, the color was similar to that of modern scorpions and to that of another eurypterid which had been similarly studied, Megalograptus ohioensis. The dorsal side of the prosoma, mesosoma and the tergites (segments) of the metasoma were light brown while elongated scales alongside the exoskeleton were darker brown grading into black at the apex of the scales. Smaller scales alongside the edges of the metasomal tergites were also brown but contrasted against the lighter brown of the other integument. The operculum (the first and second abdominal segments) and the plates of the abdomen were brown but lighter than the tergites and their scales were, as with the other scales, darker than the surrounding integument. Black-tipped scales also occurred on the legs, where the general integument was dark brown. The spines of the walking legs were dark brown but black at their tips. The flattened scales on the swimming paddles also graded into black, though the paddle was otherwise brown. The coxae were light brown, with darker scales. The gnathobases (\\"tooth-plates\\" on the coxae used when feeding) were completely black, as were the telson whose color contrasted with the preceding and adjacent brown segment. = Size = alt= Carcinosoma ranged in size from to in length, with the largest species by far being C. punctatum, known from the Ludlow epoch of England, and the smallest being C. libertyi, known from the Late Llandovery epoch of Canada. Though no other species came close to the size of C. punctatum, many species were moderately large, including C. harleyi from the Late Ludlow epoch of England at , C. newlini from the Early Pridoli epoch of the United States at , C. scoticus from the Llandovery epoch of Scotland at and C. spiniferum from the Late Ludlow epoch of the United States at . The second smallest known species was C. scorpioides from the Wenlock epoch of Scotland at in length.  History of research  posteriormost parts of the telson) Carcinosoma was first described under the name Eurysoma (meaning \\"wide body\\", deriving from Greek Œµ·ΩêœÅœçœÇ, \\"wide\\", and Latin soma, \\"body\\"Meaning of soma at www.dictionary.com. Retrieved 7 September 2018.) by British American geologist and paleobotanist Edward Waller Claypole in 1890, who named the type species of the new genus E. newlini in honor of a C. E. Newlin who had collected the fossils. The Eurysoma specimens had been discovered in deposits of Early Pridoli age in the Kokomo Formation of Indiana alongside several other eurypterid specimens, all of which at the time were referred to Eurypterus lacustris (though Claypole noted in the same paper that this may have been done hastily). Later in the same year, Claypole discovered that the name Eurysoma was preoccupied and thus not available to be used for his genus of eurypterids. Eurysoma had been named in 1831 for a genus of modern beetles and is today considered synonymous with the genus Brachygnathus. Claypole replaced the name Eurysoma with the new name Carcinosoma. Carcinosoma means \\"crab body\\" deriving from Latin cancer, \\"crab\\",Meaning of cancer at www.dictionary.com. Retrieved 7 September 2018. and soma, \\"body\\". In 1868, English geologist and paleontologist Henry Woodward named a new species of Eurypterus, E. scorpioides, based on fossils from Lanarkshire, Scotland. Woodward could easily distinguish the species from other genera present at the locality, such as Slimonia and Pterygotus. Another species of Eurypterus, E. scoticus was named in 1899 by Scottish zoologist and paleontologist Malcolm Laurie based on fragmentary remains recovered in deposits of Llandovery age in Scotland. In 1912, American paleontologists John Mason Clarke and Rudolf Ruedemann noted that Carcinosoma was sufficiently similar to the related eurypterid Eusarcus to be designated as synonymous with it. As Eusarcus had been named in 1875, fifteen years earlier than Carcinosoma, its name had priority and replaced Carcinosoma. At this time, the combined genus of Eusarcus contained several species that are today seen as Carcinosoma, including C. newlini, C. scoticus and C. scorpioides, which Clarke and Ruedemann had referred to the genus on account of their similarities with C. newlini and species previously referred to Eusarcus. In 1934, 59 years after it had been described, Eusarcus was recognized as a name preoccupied by a harvestman. The Norwegian geologist Leif St√∏rmer proposed that the name of the taxon should be next oldest available and valid name for the genus, Carcinosoma. During the preparation for his paper on the issue, St√∏rmer also discussed the situation with fellow Norwegian researcher Embrik Strand, who helped confirm that Carcinosoma was not preoccupied. Strand would subsequently propose the replacement name Eusarcana in 1942, despite the problem having been dealt with by St√∏rmer, who he had been in contact with, eight years earlier. The reasons for proposing the name during the circumstances of the time remains unknown, but critique from contemporary researchers of Strand for his studies in systematics and an apparent desire to name as many taxa as possible may explain the situation somewhat. As it was seen as completely unnecessary at the time, Strand's Eusarcana was overlooked and not even mentioned in subsequent eurypterid studies. Fossil of C. scorpioides In 1961, American paleontologist Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering classified Eurypterus punctatus (originally described as Pterygotus punctatus by English paleontologist and prominent eurypterid researcher John William Salter in 1859) as Carcinosoma punctatum and named a new species C. harleyi based on fossils from the Ludlow epoch of the Welsh Borderland. Kjellesvig-Waering could differentiate C. harleyi from C. punctatum based on C. harleyi lacking serrations on the eighth podomere of the swimming leg and the serrations of the ninth podomere being less developed. C. punctatum was diagnosed by Kjellesvig-Waering in 1961 based on the considerably pronounced serrations of the distal parts of its swimming leg, but the diagnosis is only valid for the lectotype specimen of the species, BGS GSM89435 (compromising the distal parts of a swimming leg discovered in deposits of Middle Ludlow age in the Mocktree Shale of Leintwardine in Herefordshire, England), and four other specimens from the same locality (BMNH 39389, BMNH In. 43804, BGS GSM89561 and GSM89568). Due to a close resemblance of the swimming legs, C. punctatum is assumed to have been similar in appearance to C. newlini. C. punctatum can be distinguished from C. newlini by the serration along the margin of the distal podomeres of C. punctatum being more pronounced. C. harleyi, from the Late Ludlow epoch, was described mainly based on specimens previously known (some having been reported by Salter as early as 1859) but previously referred to Eurypterus punctatus. Recognized by Kjellesvig-Waering as distinct, the species is named in honor of John Harley, one of the earliest collectors of eurypterid fossils in the region. Noted as moderately large in size by Kjellesvig-Waering, the holotype specimen of C. harleyi (No. 89434 in the collection of the Geological Survey and Museum in London) is a fragment of a swimming leg measuring in length. The nearly complete lack of serrations in the joints of C. harleyi makes the species very distinct from C. punctatum and other species of Carcinosoma. In 1964, both C. punctatum and C. harleyi were still recognized as part of Carcinosoma following an emended diagnosis of the genus by Kjellesvig-Waering and American paleontologist Kenneth Edward Caster, though C. harleyi was only tentatively recognized. Further species recognized at the time were C. libertyi and C. logani (both from Ontario, Canada; C. logani was later found to be a crustacean and not a eurypterid at all), C. spiniferum (from New York, United States), C. newlini (from Indiana, United States), C. scorpioides and C. scoticus (both from Scotland). Out of these species, only C. newlini and C. scorpioides preserve the swimming legs, where the diagnostic characters of the genus are, which makes the assignment of the other species to Carcinosoma less secure. Kjellesvig-Waering and Caster also recognized Eusarcus and Carcinosoma to be distinct genera when revising the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea, and coined the replacement name Paracarcinosoma to designate the species previously assigned to Eusarcus. E. scorpionis was designated the type species. Caster and Kjellesvig-Waering made no mention of Embrik Strand or Eusarcana, and they were likely not aware of the existence of the previous name. In 2012, American paleontologists Jason A. Dunlop and James Lamsdell designated Paracarcinosoma as a junior synonym of Eusarcana per the taxonomic laws of priority.  Classification  Carcinosoma is classified as part of the family Carcinosomatidae, one of two families within the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea (the other being the Mixopteridae), alongside the genera Eusarcana, Eocarcinosoma and Rhinocarcinosoma. The cladogram below is adapted from a larger cladogram (simplified to only display the Carcinosomatoidea) in a 2007 study by eurypterid researcher O. Erik Tetlie, in turn based on results from various phylogenetic analyses on eurypterids conducted between 2004 and 2007.  Paleobiology  Sketch of the fossil telson of C. newlini and a close-up of the \\"post-telson\\" with its segments labelled 1-11 The walking legs of Carcinosoma were turned forward, which also directed the large spines on the appendages forward. In C. newlini, these flat and forward-facing legs are thought to have been used to create a trap to capture prey in. The strong structures seen in C. newlini are not reflected in other carcinosomatids. For instance, the appendages of Eusarcana were much more weakly developed and would not have served as an effective weapon. Eusarcana is more likely to have relied on its telson, taking the shape of a sharp and curved stinger similar to that of scorpions and potentially capable of injecting venom. Instead of taking the shape of a scorpion-like stinger, the telson of Carcinosoma was slightly flattened and expanded anteriorly. The telsons of most eurypterids ends in a spike but the telson of Carcinosoma ended in a small and expanded structure with distinct segmentation, fossils preserving ten segments (though a small portion of the structure is not preserved, making more segments possible), otherwise not definitely reported from a eurypterid. The only other eurypterid from which a segmented structure occurring as part of the telson has been reported in is the slimonid Salteropterus abbreviatus. With such segmentation reported from two separate eurypterid genera, it is possible that the eurypterid telson is actually developed from a formerly normal abdominal segment and is thus not homologous to the telson of other arthropod groups. Further studies of Salteropterus has since revealed that the perceived \\"segmentation\\" of its \\"post-telson\\" was misinterpreted ornamentation of an elongated and unusually shaped telson and not actual segmentation, making the segmentation of Carcinosoma unique.  Paleoecology  Close-up of the prosoma (head) and walking appendages of a fossil specimen of C. newlini As the opisthosoma of Carcinosoma wasn't as streamlined as that of more active eurypterids and on account of its unique telson morphology, it is believed that Carcinosoma was not a very active swimmer. It is unlikely to have been well adapted to a completely nektonic (actively swimming) lifestyle and is more likely to have been nektobenthic (swimming near the bottom). The flat metasoma of Carcinosoma was probably used as at least partially as aid when swimming, suggested by the pretelson being slightly expanded in comparison to other eurypterids. As a considerable majority of described eurypterid species are known from the Silurian, particularly the late Silurian, researchers have concluded that the group peaked in diversity and number during this time. Complex eurypterid faunas, compromising several different species in different ecological roles, are typical of the period. These faunas were typically dominated by one or more particular eurypterid families, the dominant groups depending on the environment and location. Three such types of eurypterid faunas have been documented from the late Silurian, out of which a Carcinosomatidae- Pterygotidae fauna is the most marine type. All known examples of Carcinosoma are known from marine beds, typically occurring with trilobites, starfish, bryozoans, brachiopods, linguloids and other marine animals. Carcinosoma also prominently occurs together with pterygotid eurypterids. In the fossil deposits of the Welsh Borderland, examples of Carcinosoma occur together with representatives of the pterygotid genera Erettopterus and Pterygotus over a period of millions of years (though other eurypterids, such as Salteropterus, Dolichopterus, Hughmilleria, Eurypterus, Marsupipterus, Mixopterus, Parahughmilleria, Slimonia, Tarsopterella and Stylonurus are also present in lesser numbers). Other types of late Silurian eurypterid faunas include one dominated by the Eurypteridae. When genera such as Erieopterus or Eurypterus occur in great numbers other genera and families are more rare, though groups such as dolichopterids, carcinosomatids and pterygotids tend to occur in small numbers. The environments with such faunas appear to be quieter waters such as lagoons, estuaries and bays. The third and final recognized type of fauna is one dominated by hughmilleriids and stylonurids, generally alongside sandy bottoms and with few other associated fossils. The environments inhabited by this third fauna was likely less marine than the others, possibly representing the more brackish parts of bays and estuaries.

Biography Jano studied fine arts in Paris for three years. His first comic was Kebra in 1978, in collaboration with Bertrand Tramber. It was published in French comic magazines B.D., M√©tal Hurlant, Charlie Mensuel, Rigolo, L'Echo des Savannes and Zoulou. Kebra is a rat-like character, although Jano's protagonists often defy a correct classification as a certain species. Gazoline, a female humanized cheetah, appeared in Kosmik Komiks in 1983. After a trip to Africa in 1984 Jano created Keubla. His style sometimes is compared to Moebius', but more comical and down-to-earth and with definitely more sex scenes. In addition to his comics Jano illustrated books for children as well as his own travel experiences. In 2003 Anna Azevedo, Renata Baldo, and Eduardo Souza Lima made the documentary film Rio de Jano, showing Jano exploring Rio de Janeiro.

Homeopathy is a pseudoscience and the use of homeopathy in place of vaccination (alongside other relevant prevention advice) is widely considered by doctors, scientists and regulatory bodies as harmful and irresponsible. Even within the sphere of homeopathy it is not universally accepted. The concept came to wider notice in the UK after an undercover operation by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Sense About Science and BBC Newsnight in 2006. Posing as a traveller to countries known to be affected by malaria a researcher visited pharmacies in London and recorded her conversations with homeopaths who offered the (mistaken) advice that homeopathic remedies could protect against malaria. Dr Peter Fisher, the then Director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (since renamed to Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine) told Newsnight that there was \\"absolutely no reason to think that homeopathy works to prevent malaria\\" and that \\"people may even die of malaria if they follow this advice.\\" Following the programme's broadcast the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) began an investigation into some of the pharmacies involved but in 2011 announced it was dropping the cases citing improvements already made to prevent a re-occurrence and the cases not meeting the threshold criteria for a referral to the investigation committee. In 2010 a BBC Scotland programme found that three of the six members of the Homeopathic Medical Association, based in Scotland, were offering homeopathic MMR 'vaccines' to parents. In November 2014 the Canadian programme CBC Marketplace investigated the advice parents were being given in homeopathic practices in Toronto and Vancouver, finding that some \\"offered treatments, called \\"nosodes\\", [created from biological materials such as pus, diseased tissue, bacilli from sputum or (in the case of \\"bowel nosodes\\") faeces\\"] as vaccine alternatives, telling parents that the treatment is as effective as vaccines against diseases such as measles, polio and pertussis (whooping cough), which is highly contagious and can be fatal for infants\\", a practice described by Shannon MacDonald (a registered nurse and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Alberta) as \\"terribly irresponsible\\". In December 2014, Australian Federal Court found that homeopathy supplier Homeopathy Plus! and its director Frances Sheffield, had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct regarding both the effectiveness of the whooping cough vaccine and also implying that homeopathic alternatives were safe and effective in preventing whooping cough. In doing so they breached Australian Consumer Law. An undercover investigation in May 2019 by The Times highlighted the continued problem of some alternative medicine practitioners in the UK offering homeoprophylaxis. The Society of Homeopaths responded to one of their members being included in the feature (as someone who has offered homeoprophylaxis) by lodging an official complaint to IPSO, the press regulator. The Society's position statement \\"does not endorse the use of homeopathic medicines as an alternative to vaccination for the prevention of serious infectious diseases\\" though, somewhat conflictingly, also suggests that \\"homeoprophylaxis may be effective in certain circumstances\\".

It was based on a series of four books written by Leigh and illustrated by Marion Wilson. Most of this series no longer exists in the archives, but the first episode is known to exist. Background The series ran from 27 February 1962 until 26 February 1963, with 52 episodes of about thirteen minutes. The copyright date on the first episode is 1960. The show was produced by Roberta Leigh and directed by Arthur Provis. The art director was Bill Palmer, and the editor was Peter Saunders. The puppets were made by Jack Whitehead and operated by Jane Tyson, Jane Phillips and Michael Whitehead. Roberta Leigh wrote the screenplay, music and lyrics. The music was arranged by Ronald Hanmer and the show was made by P. P. Productions of Teddington for Roberta Leigh. Unlike some similar puppet shows of the time, the puppet strings were all but invisible. Plot Sara Brown lives with her parents, above their \\"Toy Hospital\\" shop. In the first episode an old man brings in a broken toy, which he has found in a goblin ring, to sell. The toy, called \\"Hoppity\\", can sing and dance, but it is a \\"falling over dance\\" as the toy only has one leg. Her parents want nothing to do with the toy, but Miss Julie who lives up in the attic and makes clothes for all the toys, gives Sara the money to buy Hoppity. The man accepts six pence. Sara washes the dirty toy and her father finds it a new leg, but one a little bit shorter than the other. Miss Julie gives her clothes for him, and her mother gives Hoppity two shiny glass beads for eyes. Her mother cuts off a little of Sara's hair and puts it on the bald doll's head. Miss Julie also gives Sara an apron with a pocket big enough for Hoppity. When wound up, the toy dances and sings annoying \\"Diddly dum, diddly dee\\" song, which Sara somehow understands. Being very naughty, Hoppity's ideas often lead Sara into trouble. For example, in the first episode, she cuts all the flowers from an expensive hat, belonging to her step aunt Matilda, to put in a vase on the dining table.

According to 1919 Report by Henry Morgenthau, Sr. who led the Mission of The United States to Poland; during Poland's fight for independence towards the end of the First World War, shortly after the Austro-Hungarian troops were evacuated from Kielce by their military command, the city authorities allowed local Jewish community to hold a rally at the Polish Theatre. The participants rallied behind the Jewish demand for political and cultural autonomy.Mission of The United States to Poland, Henry Morgenthau, Sr. Report According to one U.S. source, during the rally, anti-Polish speeches were also being delivered. A respected lawyer, Mr. Frajzyngier, who attempted to deliver a public address in Polish was booed. The angry audience shouted: \\"No Polish language here!\\" According to Stanis≈Çaw Bia≈Çek from the Jan Karski Society, the voices of protest sparked a rumour about the anti-Polish character of the meeting. As the meeting went on, a crowd of Polish onlookers gathered outside the theatre. At 6:30 P.M. the meeting began to break up, wrote Morgenthau. Only about 300 people remained in the auditorium. Soon, a group of soldiers entered the theatre and began to search for arms, driving the Jews towards the stairs, where a double line of extremists, some armed with clubs and bayonets beat the Jews as they were leaving the building according to Morgenthau. Outside the theatre, Jews were assaulted by the right-wing mob again. Jewish homes and shops were damaged. During the pogrom four Jews were killed and a large number wounded, wrote Morgenthau. based on information provided by a Russian writer M.J.

Netball career =Domestic career= Born in Warracknabeal, Victoria, Medhurst rose to prominence in 2004, when the then-twenty-year-old had a strong debut for the Adelaide Thunderbirds. Replacing club stalwart Jacqui Delaney, Medhurst put many of the world's best defenders to task with her accuracy, speed, and elusive nature. With the start of the ANZ Championship in 2008, Medhurst re- signed with the Thunderbirds for the inaugural season in. She stayed at the club for two years, before signing with the Queensland Firebirds for the 2010 season. At the Firebirds she claimed the 2011 premiership and was named the season's MVP. In 2014, Medhurst moved to Perth to play for the West Coast Fever, reuniting with her former Australian coach Norma Plummer, shifting with Firebirds wing attack Chelsea Pitman, and forging stronger links with Australian goal shooter Caitlin Bassett. Later, she was announced as club captain. Medhurst quickly became the highest-profile player at the Fever. In 2017 the new Super Netball league was formed and Medhurst signed a three-year deal with the Fever that was supposed to have resulted in her staying at the club until the end of the 2019 season. Controversially, Medhurst's final year option with the Fever was not picked up after their 2018 campaign ended up in a grand final loss. On 14 September 2018, Collingwood Magpies Netball announced they had signed her on a two-year deal. In 2019 Medhurst played 15 matches for the Magpies and had a shooting accuracy rate of 82%.

She continued to develop as a player at open level, and in 2007 she finally made her debut with the Australia national netball team against Jamaica on 8 July 2007. Her shooting accuracy was 100% during the quarter she was on, shooting 7 from 7. Medhurst continued her strong debut season for Australia during the 2007 Netball World Championships, where she ended the preliminary rounds as the third-most accurate shooter at the championships, with a strike rate of 91%. Her rise continued in the grand final against New Zealand, when she was brought on in the final quarter when Australia's senior shooters were struggling.

She cemented her position in the Australian line-up over time, and was named in the national team's 2014 Commonwealth Games side where she gold. By 2015 Medhurst had reached the elite ranks of international netball, becoming one of only eight players to have won three world titles, with success at the 2015 Netball World Cup in Sydney. Medhurst played a crucial supporting role in the final to shooter Caitlin Bassett that saw the Diamonds win their third- straight World Championship, winning 58-55. Medhurst and teammate Julie Corletto both made their debut together in 2007 and finished with their third World Championship, with Corletto retiring from netball following the Tournament. She continued to feature in the Diamonds line-ups in 2016, though in June 2017 she was left out of the squad for the international season.

The Museum is housed in a 100-year-old Carnegie Library building. The Museum works to educate young people about the positive contributions of blacks to the cultures of the world, and to eliminate the distorted portrayals and images of black people. History The African American Museum in Cleveland was founded by Icabod Flewellen in 1953. It became the first independent African American museum to open in America. Flewellen was a long-time resident of East Cleveland and best known for his extensive collection of African-American historical artifacts and souvenirs. By age 13, Flewellen began collecting historical newspaper clippings dedicated to the history of black Americans, a passion inspired by the writings of Jamaican-born author J. A. Rogers. Icabod‚Äôs first museum collection, which he noted had been exceedingly rich with historical material, was destroyed at his West Virginia home in a firebomb by white supremacists shortly after his return from the military. Flewellen‚Äôs collection of materials, after the fire in his West Virginia home, eventually became the main artifacts of the Museum. He then migrated to Cleveland, Ohio in 1949, began collecting materials again, and relaunched his second African American Museum originally known as the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Society in 1953. The majority of Flewellen‚Äôs collected material was obtained by visiting neighbors and asking them about their family histories. One collection that remains in the museum today is from the Cleveland‚Äôs \\"Parade of Progress\\" in 1964. Other portions of his collection went to the East Cleveland Library Debra Ann November Center. Mission The African American Museum, formerly the Afro-American Cultural & Historical Society Museum which was established in April 1953 is located at 1765 Crawford Rd. in Cleveland. It is a nonprofit cultural and educational museum that aims to share the achievements of African Americans. Flewellen believed that everyone should have the opportunity to see the accomplishments of Africans and those of African descent. Although they were originally stored at his home on Harkness Avenue, it was moved in 1968 to a classroom at St. Marian‚Äôs School. In May 1973, the collection (more than 200,000 items at the time) was moved to 1839 E. 81st St., where it was housed until February 1983, when the Cleveland Public Library (CPL) leased Flewellen its Treasure House building on Crawford Rd. CPL turned over the management of the building to the museum in September 1984. The museum building was renamed Icabod Flewellen in 1987 and can be seen in the photo. Funding Flewellen worked other jobs to support this project and due to an increase in black history interest, he received grants for special projects, such as a $10,000 grant from the Cleveland Foundation in 1970 to catalog his collection. The Ohio Humanities Council and the National Endowment for the Humanities also provided support, and in 1983 the museum received a $50,000 community development block grant for lectures to schoolchildren and community groups. In 1992 the museum received grants from the Cleveland and Gund Foundations. Closure The museum has been closed since 2005 due to lack of proper building functions and funds. As of 2010, it is open only on selected days. It is raising funds in hopes of re-opening. Its mission will remain the same: to store, share, and educate the public on contributions made to the world by people of African descent. Over the decades, the museum has provided the Cleveland community with cultural education about black history and events that celebrate African Americans. Exhibits * African Past and Present * Civil Movements in America * Reflections of Black Life in Cleveland * Black Scientists and Inventors (Supported in part by NASA.) * The African Solar Village Outreach Project In partnership with Green Energy Ohio the museum hosted an exhibit on the use of solar power in African Villages. The museum installed a solar panel on its roof. The components of the system are in a clear display case and part of the exhibit. The African Solar Village Outreach Project plans to establish creative avenues for teaching science and mathematics, specifically Solar Energy, to visitors. The African Solar Village exhibit, its other tours and hands-on activities are designed to offer an understanding of how science and culture interrelate in unique ways.

Inlandsv√§gen is at the same time the European route E45 in Sweden. The term Inlandsv√§gen is also used about Riksv√§g 26 (National Road 26) that begins in Halmstad in the south and ends in Mora in the midst of Sweden, even though this is called Inlandsv√§gen Syd (The Inland Road South).  The route  Inlandsv√§gen in southern Lapland Starting in Gothenburg by the Kattegatt in southwestern Sweden, the road passes Lake V√§nern to the west through V√§rmland and Dalarna to Mora at Lake Siljan. The road then continues via Orsa through H√§rjedalen and J√§mtland to √ñstersund at the Lake Storsj√∂n. From then on the route goes through Lapland and its wilderness, via the towns Vilhelmina, Storuman, Arvidsjaur, Jokkmokk and G√§llivare to its northern terminus in Karesuando at the Finnish border. Inlandsv√§gen is simultaneously the European route E45 in Sweden, between G√§llivare and Svappavaara it is also the European route E10. The European route E45 and Riksv√§g 26 follows the same route for approximately between Johannisholm and Mora, the latter being the end of the road for Riksv√§g 26. Only the first few kilometers of road after Gothenburg is motorway. Most parts of Inlandsv√§gen have just two lanes with two-way-traffic; a wide asphalted road that follows the terrain. About south of Jokkmokk Inlandsv√§gen crosses the Arctic Circle at . Inlandsv√§gen Syd (The Inland Road South) is a term used about Riksv√§g 26 (National Road 26) that begins in Halmstad in the south and ends in Mora in the midst of Sweden, The most parts of Inlandsv√§gen Syd also just have two lanes with two-way-traffic.  History  The name is related to the famous Inland Line (Inlandsbanan), a railroad line that used to run almost parallel between Kristinehamn and Mora (Riksv√§g 26), and still today nearly always runs parallel to the road between Mora and G√§llivare (European route E45). The communities and small towns with direct connections to the road have financed the marketing of Inlandsv√§gen. They tried to make drivers (especially tourists) use the road through the center of Sweden, and hoped that more people would choose Inlandsv√§gen instead of the European route E4 to the east, which is in better condition and also faster as an alternative route. Originally Inlandsv√§gen was not a European Route. Until the end of 2006 the road was the Swedish national road 45.

After leaving the AIS, Nourse went on to join the struggling Queensland Firebirds, where she failed to reach the heights she had in the previous season. The Firebirds were competition cellar-dwellers in 2004 and 2005, until former Australian great, Vicki Wilson, took over the coaching of the side in 2006, and turned their fortunes around remarkably, leading them to the finals for the first ever time. This also turned Nourse's career around, as she was re-selected for the Australian squad at the end of 2006. Nourse was called into the Australian open team in July 2007, as a replacement for injured defender Mo'onia Gerrard. She made her debut against New Zealand on 21 July 2007, and performed admirably.

Ginsenosides or panaxosides are a class of natural product steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins. Compounds in this family are found almost exclusively in the plant genus Panax (ginseng), which has a long history of use in traditional medicine that has led to the study of pharmacological effects of ginseng compounds. As a class, ginsenosides exhibit a large variety of subtle and difficult-to-characterize biological effects when studied in isolation. Ginsenosides can be isolated from various parts of the plant, though typically from the roots, and can be purified by column chromatography. The chemical profiles of Panax species are distinct; although Asian ginseng, Panax ginseng, has been most widely studied due to its use in traditional Chinese medicine, there are ginsenosides unique to American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and Japanese ginseng (Panax japonicus). Ginsenoside content also varies significantly due to environmental effects. Classification Ginsenosides are named according to their retention factor in thin layer chromatography (TLC). They can be broadly divided into two groups based on the carbon skeletons of their aglycones: the four-ring dammarane family, which contains the majority of known ginsenosides, and the oleanane family. The dammaranes further subdivided into 2 main groups, the protopanaxadiols and protopanaxatriols, with other smaller groups such as the ocotillol-type pseudoginsenoside F11 and its derivatives. Chemical structure Most known ginsenosides are classified as members of the dammarane family. The structure of these dammarane ginsenosides consists of a 4-ring, steroid-like structure. To each ginsenoside is bound at least 2 or 3 hydroxyl groups at the carbon-3 and -20 positions or the carbon-3, -6, and -20 positions respectively. In protopanaxadiols, sugar groups attach to the 3-position of the carbon skeleton, while in comparison sugar groups attach to the carbon-6 position in protopanaxatriols. Well known protopanaxadiols include Rb1, Rb2, Rg3, Rh2, and Rh3. Well known protopanaxatriols include Rg1, Rg2, and Rh1. Ginsenosides that are a member of the oleanane family are pentacylic, composed of a five ring carbon skeleton. Biosynthesis The biosynthetic pathway of ginsenosides is not entirely characterized, though as steroids they derive from pathways that lead to the synthesis of isoprene units. A proposed pathway converts squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene via the action of squalene epoxidase, at which point dammaranes can be synthesized through dammarenediol synthase, oleananes through beta-amyrin synthase, and another class of molecules, the phytosterols, through cycloartenol synthase. In the proposed pathway, squalene is synthesized from the assembly of two farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) molecules. Each molecule of FPP is in turn the product of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate and two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). IPP is produced by the mevalonic pathway in the cytosol of a ginseng plant cell and by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in the plant's plastid. Ginsenosides likely serve as mechanisms for plant defense. Ginsenosides have been found to have both antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Ginsenoside molecules are naturally bitter-tasting and discourage insects and other animals from consuming the plant. Metabolism Ginseng is generally consumed orally as a dietary supplement, and thus its component ginsenosides may be metabolized by gut flora. For example, ginsenosides Rb1 and Rb2 are converted to 20-b-O- glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiol or 20(S)-protopanaxadiol by human gut bacteria. This process is known to vary significantly between individuals. In some cases the metabolites of ginsenosides may be the biologically active compounds. Biological effects Most studies of the biological effects of ginsenosides have been in cell culture or animal models and thus their relevance to human biology is unknown. Effects on the cardiovascular system, central nervous system and immune system have been reported, primarily in rodents. Antiproliferative effects have also been described. Many studies suggest that ginsenosides have antioxidant properties. Ginsenosides have been observed to increase internal antioxidant enzymes and act as a free-radical scavenger. Ginsenosides Rg3 and Rh2 have been observed in cell models as having an inhibitory effect on the cell growth of various cancer cells while studies in animal models have suggested that ginsenosides have neuroprotective properties and could be useful in treating neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Two broad mechanisms of action have been suggested for ginsenoside activity, based on their similarity to steroid hormones. They are amphiphilic and may interact with and change the properties of cell membranes. Some ginsenosides have also been shown to be partial agonists of steroid hormone receptors. It is not known how these mechanisms yield the reported biological effects of ginsenosides. The molecules as a class have low bioavailability due to both metabolism and poor intestinal absorption.

Economic growth rates increased as policies were liberalised though not as quickly as in China. Urbanisation was also very slow compared to that in China. Rate of growth of population and fertility rates decreased. Infant mortality rates saw a good rate of decrease. Two polarising trends emerged in national politics - that of the politics of social justice based on caste which followed the implementation of Mandal commission report, and of the politics of religion based on Hindu nationalism, which was marked by demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 and the subsequent communal riots. Era of coalitions The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha but without enough strength to prove a majority on the floor of that Parliament. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the Janata Dal emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Deve Gowda lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew his support in March 1997. Inder Kumar Gujral replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition. In November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government with Vajpayee again serving as Prime Minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of underground nuclear tests, prompting President of the United States Bill Clinton and Japan to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to the 1995 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. Economy As the government liberalised its economic policies, economic growth surged and the foundation was laid for India becoming one of the fastest growing economies of the world. The former Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh was instrumental in bringing about this change although India, with its socialist past, could not push economic reforms as aggressively as China which raced ahead during this decade from being just ahead of India to a GDP double that of India (a 4 times higher rate of growth) due to its more aggressive rate of economic reform. The License Raj came to an end. GDP per capita nearly doubled from US$1,380 in 1990 to US$2,420 in 2000. This rate of growth was 11th fastest in the world. Foreign direct investment, which contributed less than 0.1% to the GDP came close to contributing 1% to the GDP. Foreign exchange reserves, which had plunged to zero, surged to 50 billion US dollars. Short term external debt which had risen to 350% of foreign exchange reserves plunged to 25% of foreign exchange reserves. Foreign direct investment (mainly from USA, UK, Germany and Japan) started to become positive. The Indian rupee plunged from 25:1 to 45:1 compared to the USD. Contribution of services sector to GDP increased rapidly. Leaders *P.V.
