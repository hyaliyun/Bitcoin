Biography Alm√°sy was born in Borosty√°nk≈ë, Austria-Hungary (today Bernstein im Burgenland, Austria), into a Hungarian noble family (his father was the zoologist and ethnographer Gy√∂rgy Alm√°sy), and, from 1911 to 1914, was educated at Berrow School, situated in a private house in Eastbourne, England, where he was tutored by Daniel Wheeler.Eastbourne Local History Society Newsletter Nr 143 =World War I= During World War I, Alm√°sy joined the 11th Hussars along with his brother Janos. Alm√°sy saw action against the Serbians, and then the Russians on the Eastern Front. In 1916, he transferred to the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops. After being shot down over Northern Italy in March 1918, Alm√°sy saw out the remainder of the war as a flight instructor. =Interwar period= After the war, Alm√°sy returned to join the Eastbourne Technical Institute, in East Sussex, England. From November 1921 to June 1922, he lodged at the same address in Eastbourne. He was a member of the pioneering Eastbourne Flying Club. Returning to Hungary, Alm√°sy became the personal secretary of the Bishop of Szombathely, J√°nos Mikes, one of the leading figures of the abortive post-war Habsburg restoration attempt. The young Alm√°sy became involved in these events by accident as the driver of Bishop Mikes when King Karl IV of Hungary returned to Hungary in 1921 to claim the throne, and was helped by Mikes to reach Budapest (from where he was politely but firmly sent back to Austria by Mikl√≥s Horthy, the Regent of Hungary). After he was introduced, the King continued to refer to him as \\"Count Alm√°sy\\", confusing L√°szl√≥ with another branch of the family. This was the basis for Alm√°sy using the title to his advantage, mostly in Egypt among the Egyptian Royalty to open doors that would have remained closed to a commoner. However, he himself admitted in private conversations that the title was not legitimate.Kubassek, J√°nos, A Szahara b≈±v√∂let√©ben (Enchanted by the Sahara), Panor√°ma, Budapest 1999 After 1921, Alm√°sy worked as a representative of the Austrian car firm Steyr Automobile in Szombathely, Hungary, and won many car races in the Steyr colours. He managed to persuade a wealthy friend, Prince Antal Eszterh√°zy, to join him in driving a Steyr from Alexandria to Khartoum, before embarking on a hunting expedition to the Dinder River, a feat which had never before been accomplished by an ordinary automobile.Alm√°sy, L√°szl√≥, Aut√≥val Szud√°nba (With Motorcar to the Sudan), Franklin, Budapest 1929 The 1926 drive from Egypt to the Sudan along the Nile proved to be the turning point in his life. Alm√°sy developed an interest in the area and later returned there to drive and hunt. He also demonstrated Steyr vehicles in desert conditions in 1929 with two Steyr lorries and led his first expedition to the desert. In 1931 Alm√°sy made arrangements with a Cairo - Cape Town expedition, led by captain G. Malins, to make a detour and accompany him to Uweinat and northern Sudan on what was planned to be the first exploration of the Libyan Desert by aeroplane. He was accompanied by Count N√°ndor Zichy. They took off from M√°ty√°sf√∂ld Airport Budapest on 21 August in a De Havilland Gipsy Moth that had been purchased by Zichy in England a few weeks earlier. Four days later they crashed in a storm near Aleppo. Both survived with scratches only, but the aircraft was a total wreck. The Syrian papers reported them dead, and the Malins expedition left Cairo without them.Alm√°sy, L√°szl√≥, Leveg≈ëben... homokon... (In Air... on Sand...), Franklin, Budapest 1937 L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy with N√°ndor Zichy at M√°ty√°sf√∂ld Airport, Budapest 1931 =Exploring the Libyan Desert= In 1932, Alm√°sy embarked on an expedition to find the legendary Zerzura, \\"The Oasis of the Birds,\\" with three Britons, Sir Robert Clayton, Squadron Leader H.W.G.J. Penderel and Patrick Clayton. The expedition used both cars and a De Havilland Gipsy Moth aeroplane owned by Sir Robert Clayton. While Alm√°sy went with two cars to Kufra Oasis, Sir Robert and Penderel discovered a valley with green vegetation inside the Gilf Kebir plateau, which they presumed to be one of the three hidden valleys of Zerzura. Their attempts to reach the mouth of the valley by car failed.Alm√°sy, L√°szl√≥, Ismeretlen Szahara (Unknown Sahara), Franklin, Budapest 1935 Later in 1932, Alm√°sy's sponsor and travel companion Sir Robert Clayton East-Clayton died of acute spinal poliomyelitis contracted within two months of completing the spring 1932 expedition to the Gilf Kebir. (Robert East-Clayton died, not from a crash-landing as described in The English Patient but from an infection possibly picked up during the desert expedition. However, East-Clayton's wife Dorothy, also a pilot, did die in a peculiar plane accident, at Brooklands on 15 September 1933.) Despite the setbacks, Alm√°sy succeeded in organizing another Zerzura expedition for the spring of 1933, this time with the desert explorer Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein as his sponsor. He was accompanied by Squadron Leader H.W.G.J. Penderel, the Austrian writer Richard Bermann (pen name Arnold Hollriegel) and the German cinematographer and photographer Hans Casparius. This expedition succeeded in entering the valley discovered the previous year, and circumstantial evidence collected from an old Tibou at Kufra Oasis confirmed the identity of the valleys as Zerzura. Later on this expedition, Almasy succeeded in entering Wadi Talh, (the third valley of Zerzure), and at the very end of the expedition Alm√°sy, together with Lodovico di Caporiacco, discovered the prehistoric rock paintings of Ain Dua at Jebel Uweinat.Hollriegel, ArnoldZarzura, die Oase der kleinen v√∂gel, Orell F√ºssli, Z√ºrich 1938 In the autumn of 1933 Alm√°sy embarked on a further expedition, this time with the noted German ethnographer Leo Frobenius, his assistant Hans Rhotert and draughtswoman Elisabeth Pauli (later Elisabeth Jenssen). They copied and cataloged the known prehistoric rock art sites, and made a large number of new discoveries at Karkur Talh (Jebel Uweinat) and the famous Cave of Swimmers at Wadi Sora in the Gilf Kebir.Rhotert, HansLybische Felsbilder, L. C. Wittich, Darmstadt 1952 In the spring of 1934 Alm√°sy led an expedition organised by the Royal Egyptian Automobile Club to the Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat. The expedition erected a memorial tablet for Prince Kelam el Din (who died the previous year, giving another blow to Alm√°sy's ambitions) at the southern tip of the Gilf Kebir plateau. The note left by the expedition now rests in the Heinrich Barth Institut in K√∂ln.Monument to Prince Kemal el Din, accessed 20 Oct. 2013 At Jebel Uweinat Alm√°sy visited the Sudan Defence Force camp commanded by Captain Francis Godfrey Bertram Arkwright, and together they made some new rock art discoveries at the south of Jebel Uweinat. Alm√°sy also visited and copied a panel of paintings found by Captain Arkwright at Jebel Kissu.Alm√°sy, L√°szl√≥, R√©centes Explorations dans le D√©sert Libyque Societ√© Royale de Geographie de l'Egypte, Cairo, 1936 In February 1935, Alm√°sy and his colleague Hansjoachim von der Esch became the first Europeans to re-establish contact with the Magyarab tribe, living on an island of the Nile opposite Wadi Halfa in Nubia, who speak Arabic but are believed to be the descendants of Nubian women and Hungarian soldiers serving in the Ottoman army in the 16th century. The accounts of Alm√°sy and von der Esch differ substantially. While Alm√°sy presents the discovery as his own, von der Esch describes the encountervon der Esch, HansjoachimWeenak - die Karawane ruft, Brochhaus, Leipzig 1941 as having been made after Alm√°sy left Wadi Halfa with Count Zsigmond Sz√©chenyi and Jen≈ë Horthy on a hunting trip to the Wadi Howar.Sz√©chenyi, ZsigmondHengerg≈ë Homok (Roling Sand), Budapest 1936 As Alm√°sy's only illustration shows a group of Egyptian fellahin surrounding a car (no car could have made it over to the island), while von der Esch shows several photos taken on the island, the story of the latter is more likely to be true. In April 1935, again accompanied by Hansjoachim von der Esch, Alm√°sy explored the Great Sand Sea from Ain Dalla to Siwa Oasis, the last remaining 'blank spot' untouched by earlier explorers or Patrick Clayton's surveys. In his book Alm√°sy claims to have been in the service of the Egyptian Government, a statement which led some authors to claim that Alm√°sy was a cartographer of the Libyan Desert in a formal capacity.T√∂r√∂k, Zsolt. \\"L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy: The Real 'English patient' - The Hungarian Desert Explorer.\\" F√∂ldrajzi K√∂zlem√©nyek 121.1-2 (1997): 77-86 However, as at the time Patrick Clayton was still the \\"official\\" Libyan Desert desert surveyor of the Desert Survey department of the Survey of Egypt, and the two were definitely not on good terms,Clayton, Peter, Desert Explorer (A Biography of Colonel P.A. Clayton), Zerzura Press, Cargreen 1998 this claim is very unlikely, with no surviving documentary proof. In 1939 with the help of Hansjoachim von der Esch, Alm√°sy published a German edition of a compilation (not the entire text) of selected chapters from his books published in Hungarian.Alm√°sy, Ladislaus E, Unbekannte Sahara. Mit Flugzeug und Auto in der Libyschen W√ºste (The Unknown Sahara. By Aeroplane and Car in the Libyan Desert), Brockhaus, Leipzig 1939 =End of his stay in Egypt= Alm√°sy never had the means to finance his own expeditions; he was always reliant on financial backers, some of whom raised the suspicion of the British Authorities in Egypt. By 1934 both the Italians and the British had suspected him of spying for the other side (though there is no conclusive proof that he did so for either), and in 1935 he was refused permission by the British military authorities to make another expedition to Uweinat.Foreign Office corresponcence, National Archives, London, accessed 20 Oct. 2013 His attention turned to another passion, aviation, and he was deeply involved with setting up gliding activities in Egypt under the auspices of the Royal Egyptian Aviation Club (the president of which, Taher Pasha, was also providing accommodation for Alm√°sy). There is an oft-quoted urban legend (spread mainly in Hungary) that the Almaza Air Base was named after him, but this has absolutely no foundation; the first airfield of Cairo had carried this name since its establishment during World War I, well before Alm√°sy ever visited Egypt. =World War II= After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Alm√°sy had to return to Hungary. The British suspected that he was a spy for the Italians, and vice versa. While there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in any clandestine intelligence gathering prior to the War, he was clearly not welcome by authorities on either side of the Egypt-Libya border.Kelly, Saul, The Hunt for Zerzura, John Murray, London, 2002 Hungary formally joined the Axis powers by signing the Tripartite Pact on 20 November 1940. Nikolaus Ritter of the German military intelligence service, the Abwehr, recruited Alm√°sy in Budapest. As a Hungarian reserve officer, he was permitted to wear the uniform of a Hauptmann (Captain/Flight Lieutenant) of the German Air Force, the Luftwaffe. Initially he was working on maps and country descriptions prepared by the Abteilung IV. Mil.Geo., then he was assigned to an Abwehr commando in Libya under the command of Major Nikolaus Ritter, using his aviation and desert experience in various missions. After the failure of Plan el Masri and the first Operation Condor to airdrop two German spies into Egypt (ending with the ditching of one of the two aircraft and the injury of Ritter), Alm√°sy assumed command of the unit.Gross, Kuno, Michael Rolke and Andr√°s Zboray, Operation Salaam - L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy's most daring mission in the Desert War, Belleville, M√ºnchen 2013 Alm√°sy's greatest achievement during his wartime stay in North Africa was the successful completion of Operation Salam, the infiltration of two German spies through the Libyan Desert behind enemy lines in a manner similar to the Allied Long Range Desert Group. Operation Salam was not a covert operation; Alm√°sy and his team were wearing German uniforms. They used captured British (Canadian-built) Ford cars and trucks with German crosses surreptitiously incorporated into the vehicles' camouflage pattern. Alm√°sy successfully delivered the two Abwehr agents, Johannes Eppler and his radio operator Hans-Gerd Sandstede, into Assiut in Egypt after crossing the Gilf Kebir and Kharga Oasis. Unknown to Alm√°sy and the German Command, British code breakers at Bletchley Park had succeeded in breaking the Abwehr hand cypher that Alm√°sy and the spies used for their wireless transmissions. A young intelligence analyst at Bletchley Park, Jean Alington (later Jean Howard), noticed the signal trail. However, as a warning to the British HQ ME in Cairo arrived too late (due to the imminent attack of Rommel), Afrika Korps messages had a higher priority in deciphering and analysis, and Alm√°sy was able to return to his starting point at Gialo unhindered. The subsequent Operation Condor, the actual spy mission of Eppler and Sandstede, was a complete failure. They were both captured within six weeks of reaching Cairo. Alm√°sy received the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) and a promotion to captain for the success of Operation Salam. However, his services in North Africa were no longer needed and he returned to Hungary, where he wrote a short book on his wartime experiences in Libya.Alm√°sy, L√°szl√≥, Rommel sereg√©n√©l Liby√°ban (With Rommel's Army in Libya), St√°dium, Budapest 1943 There is some evidence that he remained in contact with the Abwehr until late 1943. =Post war= After the war, as the Communists took over in Hungary, Alm√°sy was arrested for alleged war crimes and treason for joining the armed forces of a foreign power. The charge was based mainly on his wartime book. However, during the trial it emerged that neither the prosecutor nor the judge had read the book, as it was placed on the banned books list by the Soviet occupation forces. Eventually Alm√°sy was acquitted with the help of some influential friends. However, after the trial the Soviet NKVD also started looking for him. He escaped from the country, supposedly with the aid of the British Intelligence, which reportedly bribed Hungarian Communist officials to enable his release. The bribe was paid by Alaeddin Moukhtar, cousin of King Farouk of Egypt. The British then spirited him into British occupied Austria using a false passport under the name of Josef Grossman, then on to Rome, where he was escorted by Ronnie Waring, later known as the Duke of Valderano.Albo d'Oro delle Famiglie Nobili e Notabili Europee, vol XIV, Florence 2000, pp. 811-812 When Alm√°sy was pursued by a \\"hit squad\\" from the Soviet \\"Committee for State Security\\" (Komityet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosty or KGB), Valderano put him on an aeroplane to Cairo. A note of caution needs to be exercised when taking Valderano's account at face value. While he claimed to have been working for MI6 as the Rome \\"resident\\", there is no corroborating proof that Alm√°sy was helped by British Intelligence, and the story was only released following the wide media publicity generated by the 1996 film The English Patient. If indeed Alm√°sy had any contacts with British intelligence during and after the War as rumoured, any evidence is still lying in unreleased intelligence files. Back in Egypt, Alm√°sy supported himself with odd jobs, some related to aviation, but also leading hunting parties to other parts of Africa. His last brief moment of glory came in December 1950, when King Farouk appointed him Director of the newly founded Egyptian Desert Research Institute. =Death= Alm√°sy became ill in 1951 during a visit in Austria. On 22 March, he died of complications induced by amoebic dysentery‚Äîcontracted during a trip to Mozambique the previous year‚Äîin a hospital in Salzburg, where he was then buried. The epitaph on his grave, erected by Hungarian aviation and desert enthusiasts in 1995, honors him as a \\"Pilot, Saharaforscher und Entdecker der Oase Zarzura\\" (Pilot, Sahara Explorer, and Discoverer of the Zerzura Oasis). Scouting From the beginning he was a member of the Scout movement. In 1921 Alm√°sy became the International Commissioner of the Hungarian Scout Association. With Count P√°l Teleki, he took part in organizing the 4th World Scout Jamboree in G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, Hungary, where Alm√°sy presented the Air Scouts to Robert Baden-Powell on August 9, 1933. The English Patient Alm√°sy remained a little-known desert explorer until 1996, when he (or rather his fictitious character) was thrown into the limelight by the Academy Award-winning film The English Patient. The screenplay was based on the 1992 novel by Michael Ondaatje. While the storyline is pure fiction, some of the characters and the events surrounding the search for Zerzura and the Cave of Swimmers have been adapted from Geographical Journal articles describing the expeditions of the real Alm√°sy into the Libyan Desert. The publicity attracted by the film helped uncover many hitherto unknown details about Alm√°sy's life, but also resulted in a huge volume of inaccurate or outright untrue claims, mostly related to his World War II activities, which continue to circulate in print and on the web. Much of these inaccuracies and false stories has been examined and refuted in the recent (2013) book on Operation Salam by Kuno Gross, Michael Rolke and Andr√°s Zboray. In the movie, a native guide describes to Alm√°sy the physical location of the cave; \\"A mountain the shape of a woman's back\\". Alm√°sy then renders a drawing and some text that he then includes in the book that he keeps for himself.The scene that plums are found in the monastery orchard and the scene just before the Cliftons arrive at the base camp on the Crown-owned airplane.

Depending on the pitcher's arm angle, the ball may also have a sinking action. Carl Hubbell was one of the most renowned screwball pitchers in the history of Major League Baseball. Hubbell was known as the \\"scroogie king\\" for his mastery of the pitch and the frequency with which he threw it. Other famous screwball artists include Tug McGraw and Cy Young Award winners Mike Cuellar, Fernando Valenzuela, Mike Marshall, Christy Matthewson, and Willie Hern√°ndez. Grip and action The baseball is held with the open end of the horseshoe shape (where the seams are closest together) facing upward. The thumb is placed just beneath the bottom of the horseshoe, the index finger is curled against the top of the thumb, forming a tight circle to the side of the ball. The middle finger is then placed on the top of the ball and grips against the top seam, (the seam closest to the index finger). The ring finger is placed outside the other top seam loosely and the pinky is held on the side opposite the thumb; all fingers are spread apart. The grip is similar to the Circle changeup, but with different placement in regards to the seams. Also, unlike the Circle change, when throwing the screwball the middle finger applies the most pressure to the baseball, while the ring and pinky exert no pressure at all. For left-handed pitchers, as the middle finger presses hard down on the ball, their hand pronates (turns) inwardly in a clockwise manner near the end of the pitching motion, until much of the hand is beneath the ball. Conversely, right-handed pitchers turn their hand counter-clockwise.  Effects  When thrown by a right-handed pitcher, a screwball breaks from left to right from the point of view of the pitcher; the pitch therefore moves down and in on a right-handed batter and down and away from a left-handed batter. When thrown by a left-handed pitcher, a screwball breaks from right to left, moving down and in on a left-handed batter and down and away from a right-handed batter. Due to this left-to-right movement of the ball (when thrown by a right-handed pitcher), right-handed pitchers use a screwball against left-handed batters in the same way that they use a slider against right-handed batters. If thrown correctly, the screwball breaks in the opposite direction of a curveball.  Pitchers  One of the first great screwball pitchers was Christy Mathewson, who pitched for the New York Giants 1900‚Äì1916, whose pitch was then labeled as the \\"fadeaway\\"; although historians have been unable to prove it, baseball legend holds that Giants manager John McGraw arranged for Black pitcher Rube Foster to teach Mathewson the screwball, as McGraw was forbidden from hiring Foster directly. In truth, Matthewson learned the pitch from minor leaguer Dave Williams. Major league pitchers who have thrown the screwball during their careers include: * Carl Hubbell\\"Hubbell Out For Season\\", New York Times, August 24, 1938, pg. 26. * Cy Blanton\\"Blanton, Pirates, Stops Dodgers, 8-2\\", New York Times, May 19, 1935, pg.

Commonly described features include large red eyes, bared teeth and shaggy black fur. Black Shuck, Old Shuck, Old Shock or simply Shuck is the name given to an East Anglian ghostly black dog which is said to roam the coastline and countryside of East Anglia, one of many ghostly black dogs recorded in folklore across the British Isles. Accounts of Black Shuck form part of the folklore of Norfolk, Suffolk, the Cambridgeshire fens and Essex, and descriptions of the creature's appearance and nature vary considerably; it is sometimes recorded as an omen of death, but, in other instances, is described as companionable. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the name Shuck derives from the Old English word scucca - \\"devil, fiend\\", from the root word skuh- to terrify. The first mention in print of \\"Black Shuck\\" is by Reverend E.S. Taylor in an 1850 edition of the journal Notes and Queries which describes \\"Shuck the Dog- fiend\\"; \\"This phantom I have heard many persons in East Norfolk, and even Cambridgeshire, describe as having seen as a black shaggy dog, with fiery eyes and of immense size, and who visits churchyards at midnight.\\" Abraham Fleming's account of the appearance of A strange, and terrible wunder in 1577 at Bungay, Suffolk is a famous account of the beast. Images of black sinister dogs have become part of the iconography of the area and have appeared in popular culture. Writing in 1877, Walter Rye stated that Shuck was \\"the most curious of our local apparitions, as they are no doubt varieties of the same animal.\\" Descriptions Descriptions of Black Shuck vary in both shape and size, from that of a large dog to being the size of a calf or horse. W. A. Dutt, in his 1901 Highways & Byways in East Anglia describes the creature thus: Artists depiction of the Black Shuck based on W.A. Dutt's description Dr Simon Sherwood suggests that the earliest surviving description of devilish black hounds is an account of an incident in the Peterborough Abbey recorded in the Peterborough Chronicle (one version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) around 1127: This account also appears to describe the Europe-wide phenomenon of a Wild Hunt. =Bungay and Blythburgh= Title page of Rev. Abraham Fleming's account of the appearance of the ghostly black dog \\"Black Shuck\\" at the church of Bungay, Suffolk: \\"A straunge, and terrible Wunder wrought very late in the parish church of Bongay: a town of no great distance from the citie of Norwich, namely the fourth of this August, in the yeere of our Lord 1577. in a great tempest of violent raine, lightning, and thunder, the like wherof hath been seldome seene. With the appeerance of an horrible shaped thing, sensibly perceiued of the people then and there assembled. Drawen into a plain method according to the written copye. by Abraham Fleming.\\" One of the most notable reports of Black Shuck is of his appearance at the churches of Bungay and Blythburgh in Suffolk. On 4 August 1577, at Blythburgh, Black Shuck is said to have burst in through the doors of Holy Trinity Church to a clap of thunder. He ran up the nave, past a large congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the church steeple to collapse through the roof. As the dog left, he left scorch marks on the north door which can be seen at the church to this day. The encounter on the same day at St Mary's Church, Bungay was described in A Straunge and Terrible Wunder by Abraham Fleming in 1577: Fleming was a translator and editor for several printing houses in London, and therefore probably only published his account based on exaggerated oral accounts. Other local accounts attribute the event to the Devil (Fleming calls the animal \\"the Divel in such a likeness\\"). The scorch marks on the door are referred to by the locals as \\"the devil‚Äôs fingerprints\\", and the event is remembered in this verse: Dr David Waldron and Christopher Reeve suggest that a fierce electrical storm recorded by contemporary accounts on that date, coupled with the trauma of the ongoing Reformation, may have led to the accounts entering folklore. =Littleport= Littleport, Cambridgeshire is home to two different legends of spectral black dogs, which have been linked to the Black Shuck folklore, but differ in significant aspects: local folklorist W.H. Barrett relates the story of a huge black dog haunting the area after being killed rescuing a local girl from a lustful friar in pre-reformation times, while fellow folklorist Enid Porter relates stories of a black dog haunting the A10 road after its owner drowned in the nearby River Great Ouse in the 1800s. =Leiston Abbey excavation= In May 2014 a large dog was excavated at Leiston Abbey by DigVentures which was noted in the parish newsletter and then in the East Anglian Daily Times which ran a tongue-in-cheek article asking whether they were the remains of Black Shuck. The article in the East Anglian was then picked up by the Daily Mail which reported that Black Shuck was tall, a figure they also used describing the skeleton which, they said, would have \\"stood 7ft tall on its hind legs\\". The International Business Times and Yahoo! News both reported the skeleton to be Black Shuck. DigVentures itself unequivocally denied claims that the dog was Black Shuck, stating that it was tall, around the size of a mastiff. Carbon dating of the bones \\"indicated a date of either 1650-1690, 1730-1810 or post 1920\\" and the animal \\"was likely to have been interred when there was no surface trace of the original building remaining\\". East Anglian poet and songwriter, Martin Newell, wrote about the discovery and retold some of the stories he heard from locals while preparing his epic poem, Black Shuck: The Ghost Dog of Eastern England: In popular culture British rock band The Darkness have a song called \\"Black Shuck\\" on their 2003 debut album Permission to Land. In Teen Wolf, an ancient Hellhound spirit that had possessed someone, tells one of the main characters that it is known by many names, one of which is \\"Black Shuck\\". British rock band Down I Go have a song called \\"Black Shuck\\" on their 2019 EP 'All Down the Church in Midst of Fire the Hellish Monster Flew, and Passing Onward to the Quire, He Many People Slew'.https://birthdaycakebreakfast.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/ep- review-down-i-go-all-down-the-church-in-midst-of-fire-the-hellish-monster- flew-and-passing-onward-to-the-quire-he-many-people-slew/ In June 2019, after being previously crowdfunded on Kickstarter, the graphic novel The Burning Black: Legend of Black Shuck was published by Renegade Arts Entertainment. The book was written by Mark Allard-Will, with artwork by Ryan Howe and lettering by Elaine M. Will. The graphic novel features Black Shuck as its central antagonist.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-48544256 The 2019 movie Annabelle Comes Home features a Black Shuck as one of the spirits revived by the demonic doll. In modified form, the Black Shuck is described by J. K. Rowling in her 1999 novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where Harry's godfather Sirius Black, who is an Animagus, changes into the shape of a large black dog which, at the beginning of the book, is said to be \\"The Grim\\", an omen of imminent death to those who see it. The Black Shuck appears in the 2020 video game Assassin's Creed: Valhalla as a mini boss encountered while exploring the countryside of East Anglia. The player can find it eating a carcass amidst a ruined building, and when killed it gives the player a skill point and it's decapitated head.

Both Lord John Stewart and Lord Bernard Stewart died in battle in the English Civil War, fighting on the Royalist side. Cavalier () was first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642 ‚Äì ). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. Etymology Cavalier derives from the same Latin root as the Italian word and the French word (as well as the Spanish word ), the Vulgar Latin word caballarius, meaning 'horseman'. Shakespeare used the word cavaleros to describe an overbearing swashbuckler or swaggering gallant in Henry IV, Part 2 (c. 1596‚Äì1599), in which Shallow says \\"I'll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London\\". Shallow returns in The Merry Wives of Windsor (c. 1597), where he is called \\"Cavaleiro-justice\\" (knightly judge) and \\"bully-rook\\", a term meaning \\"blustering cheat\\". =English Civil War= Charles I and his adherents. \\"Cavalier\\" is chiefly associated with the Royalist supporters of King Charles I in his struggle with Parliament in the English Civil War. It first appears as a term of reproach and contempt, applied to the followers of King Charles I in June 1642: Charles, in the Answer to the Petition 13 June 1642, speaks of Cavaliers as a \\"word by what mistake soever it seemes much in disfavour\\". It was soon reappropriated as a title of honour by the king's party, who in return applied Roundhead to their opponents. At the Restoration, the court party preserved the name, which survived until the rise of the term Tory.  Social perceptions  Cavalier was not understood at the time as primarily a term describing a style of dress, but a whole political and social attitude. However, in modern times the word has become more particularly associated with the court fashions of the period, which included long flowing hair in ringlets, brightly coloured clothing with elaborate trimmings and lace collars and cuffs, and plumed hats., Meaning 4. attrib., First quotation \\"1666 EVELYN Dairy 13 Sept., The Queene was now in her cavalier riding habite, hat and feather, and horseman's coate\\". This contrasted with the dress of at least the most extreme Roundhead supporters of Parliament, with their preference for shorter hair and plainer dress, although neither side conformed to the stereotypical images entirely. Prince Rupert of the Rhine, often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. Most Parliamentarian generals wore their hair at much the same length as their Royalist counterparts, though Cromwell was something of an exception. The best patrons in the nobility of Charles I's court painter Sir Anthony van Dyck, the archetypal recorder of the Cavalier image, all took the Parliamentary side in the Civil War. Probably the most famous image identified as of a \\"cavalier\\", Frans Hals' Laughing Cavalier, shows a gentleman from the strongly Calvinist Dutch town of Haarlem, and is dated 1624. These derogatory terms (for at the time they were so intended) also showed what the typical Parliamentarian thought of the Royalist side ‚Äì capricious men who cared more for vanity than the nation at large. Cavaliers after the Battle of Naseby, 1645 The chaplain to King Charles I, Edward Simmons described a Cavalier as > a Child of Honour, a Gentleman well borne and bred, that loves his king for > conscience sake, of a clearer countenance, and bolder look than other men, > because of a more loyal Heart. There were many men in the Royalist armies who fit this description since most of the Royalist field officers were typically in their early thirties, married with rural estates which had to be managed. Triple Unite gold coin of 1644: the Latin legend translates as \\"The religion of the Protestants, the laws of England and the liberty of Parliament. Let God arise and His enemies be scattered.\\" Although they did not share the same outlook on how to worship God as the English Independents of the New Model Army, God was often central to their lives. This type of Cavalier was personified by Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading, whose prayer at the start of the Battle of Edgehill has become famous \\"O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not forget me\\". At the end of the First Civil War, Astley gave his word that he would not take up arms again against Parliament and having given his word he felt duty bound to refuse to help the Royalist cause in the Second Civil War. However, the word was coined by the Roundheads as a pejorative propaganda image of a licentious, hard drinking and frivolous man, who rarely, if ever, thought of God. It is this image which has survived and many Royalists, for example Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, fitted this description to a tee. Of another Cavalier, George Goring, Lord Goring, a general in the Royalist army, the principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, said: This sense has developed into the modern English use of \\"cavalier\\" to describe a recklessly nonchalant attitude, although still with a suggestion of stylishness. Cavalier remained in use as a description for members of the party that supported the monarchy up until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678‚Äì1681 when the term was superseded by \\"Tory\\" which was another term initially with pejorative connotations. Likewise, during Exclusion Bill crisis the term Roundhead was replaced with \\"Whig\\", a term introduced by the opponents of the Whigs and also was initially a pejorative term.

Internationales Biographisches Archiv (July 1979). munzinger.de was a famous ballet dancer and choreographer mixing classical ballet with theatre; he is also widely regarded as the founder of Tanztheater. Jooss is noted for establishing several dance companies, including most notably, the Folkwang Tanztheater, in Essen. Life and career Jooss was born in Wasseralfingen, Germany. From an early age he was interested in singing, drama and visual arts, he also played the piano and was a keen photographer. He began his career in the 1920s and from 1920 to 1924 studied under and danced lead roles in the choreography of Rudolf von Laban (who was a trained visual artist and developer of dance theory) and the movement named Ausdruckstanz. Jooss used narratives and modern theatre styles to make performable works of Dance Theatre, further developing the work of Laban and his system of notation. Within a year of leaving Laban, Jooss took the opportunity to establish his own dance company called, Die Neue Tanzb√ºhne. It was here Jooss met Fritz Cohen, the Jewish composer who worked with Jooss on many of his famous pieces. Jooss and Cohen shared the belief that choreography and musical composition should evolve together to give expression of the dramatic idea in unified style and form. In 1925 Jooss and Sigurd Leeder joined a group of artists and opened a new dance school called \\"Westf√§lische Akademie f√ºr Bewegung, Sprache und Musik\\". Jooss and Leeder went to Paris in 1926 to study classical ballet with Russian ballerina Lubov Egorova. In 1927 Jooss and Leeder's work Dance of Death was criticised for being too avant-garde; this resulted in the theatre of M√ºnster changing personnel and programs. Because of this, many of Jooss's colleagues left. The same year Jooss moved the \\"Westf√§lische Akademie\\" to Essen, and it became the Folkwang Schule. Jooss disliked plotless dances and preferred themes that addressed moral issues. Naturalistic movement, large-scale unison and characterisation were used by Jooss to address political concerns of the time. His most important choreographic work, The Green Table (1932), had won first prize at an international competition for new choreography held by the Archives Internationales de la Danse in Paris in 1932. It was a strong anti- war statement, and was made a year before Adolf Hitler became the chancellor of Germany. The Green Table is considered his most popular piece. In 1933 Jooss was forced to flee Germany when the Nazis asked him to dismiss the Jews from his company and he refused. Jooss and Leeder (and doubtless Fritz Cohen and other members of his original company) took refuge in the Netherlands before resettling in England. After touring in Europe and America, Jooss and Leeder opened a school at Dartington Hall in Devon. A piece he choreographed at this time was a light-hearted one (in comparison to The Green Table) named \\"Ball in Old Vienna (1932)\\". In 1934, whilst in England Jooss added new works to his repertoire, including Pandora (1944), contained disturbing images of human disaster and tragedy, which was later interpreted by some as foretelling the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan a year later. Jooss left England in 1949 to return to Essen, Germany. Jooss continued to teach and choreograph for 19 years. One of his students from this period was the choreographer Pina Bausch. He retired in 1968 and died in Heilbronn, West Germany, 11 years later, aged 78, from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Kurt Jooss works are still performed today, especially The Green Table. Anna Markard (Jooss' daughter) supervised companies that perform his works until her death, conserving authenticity of the author of Dance Theatre.

A zymogen requires a biochemical change (such as a hydrolysis reaction revealing the active site, or changing the configuration to reveal the active site) for it to become an active enzyme. The biochemical change usually occurs in Golgi bodies, where a specific part of the precursor enzyme is cleaved in order to activate it. The inactivating piece which is cleaved off can be a peptide unit, or can be independently folding domains comprising more than 100 residues. Although they limit the enzyme's ability, these N-terminal extensions of the enzyme or a ‚Äúprosegment‚Äù often aid in the stabilization and folding of the enzyme they inhibit. The pancreas secretes zymogens partly to prevent the enzymes from digesting proteins in the cells in which they are synthesised. Enzymes like pepsin are created in the form of pepsinogen, an inactive zymogen. Pepsinogen is activated when chief cells release it into the gastric acid, whose hydrochloric acid partially activates it. Another partially inactivated pepsinogen completes the activation by removing the peptide, turning the pepsinogen into pepsin. Accidental activation of zymogens can happen when the secretion duct in the pancreas is blocked by a gallstone, resulting in acute pancreatitis. Fungi also secrete digestive enzymes into the environment as zymogens. The external environment has a different pH than inside the fungal cell and this changes the zymogen's structure into an active enzyme. Another way that enzymes can exist in inactive forms and later be converted to active forms is by activating only when a cofactor, called a coenzyme, is bound. In this system, the inactive form (the apoenzyme) becomes the active form (the holoenzyme) when the coenzyme binds. In the duodenum, the pancreatic zymogens, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase and procarboxypeptidase are converted into active enzymes by enteropeptidase and trypsin. Chymotrypsinogen, is single polypeptide chain of 245 amino acids residues, is converted to alpha-chymotrypsin, which has three polypeptide chains linked by two of the five disulfide bond present in the primary structure of chymotrypsinogen.

It was consecrated on 10 February 1185 by Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem. During the reign of King John (1199‚Äì1216) it served as the royal treasury, supported by the role of the Knights Templar as proto-international bankers. It is now jointly owned by the Inner Temple and Middle TempleArchives of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple, TEM: Records of administration [sic] of the Temple Church (1613‚Äì1996) Inns of Court, bases of the English legal profession. It is famous for being a round church, a common design feature for Knights Templar churches, and for its 13th- and 14th-century stone effigies. It was heavily damaged by German bombing during World War II and has since been greatly restored and rebuilt. The area around the Temple Church is known as the Temple. Temple Bar, an ornamental processional gateway, formerly stood in the middle of Fleet Street. Nearby is the Temple Underground station.  History =Construction= In the mid-12th century, before the construction of the church, the Knights Templar in London had met at a site in High Holborn in a structure originally established by Hugues de Payens (the site had been historically the location of a Roman temple in Londinium, now known as London). Because of the rapid growth of the order, by the 1160s the site had become too confined, and the order purchased the current site for the establishment of a larger monastic complex as their headquarters in England. In addition to the church, the new compound originally contained residences, military training facilities, and recreational grounds for the military brethren and novices, who were not permitted to go into the City without the permission of the Master of the Temple. Floor plan of the Temple Church The church building comprises two separate sections: The original circular church building, called the Round Church and now acting as a nave, and a later rectangular section adjoining on the east side, built approximately half a century later, forming the chancel. After the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 by the Crusaders, the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church (while the Al-Aqsa Mosque became a royal palace). Because the Dome of the Rock was the site of the Temple of Solomon, the Knights Templar set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and along with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre upon which it was based soon became the architectural model for Round Templar churches across Europe. The round church is in diameter, and contains within it a circle of the earliest known surviving free-standing Purbeck Marble columns. It is probable that the walls and grotesque heads were originally painted in colours. It was consecrated on 10 February 1185\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert, C; Weinreb, D; Keay, J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993, 2008) by Heraclius, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is believed that King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189) was present at the consecration. = 1185‚Äì1307 = View of (and from) the circular triforium in the round nave The Knights Templar order was very powerful in England, with the Master of the Temple sitting in parliament as primus baro (the first baron in precedence of the realm). The compound was regularly used as a residence by kings and by legates of the Pope. The Temple also served as an early safety-deposit bank, sometimes in defiance of the Crown's attempts to seize the funds of nobles who had entrusted their wealth there. The quasi-supra-national independent network and great wealth of the Order throughout Europe, and the jealousy this caused in secular kingdoms, is considered by most commentators to have been the primary cause of its eventual downfall. In January 1215 William Marshall (who is buried in the nave next to his sons, and is represented by one of the nine stone effigies)The effigies are not in their original places served as a negotiator during a meeting in the Temple between King John and the barons, who demanded that the king should uphold the rights enshrined in the Coronation Charter of his predecessor and elder brother King Richard I. Marshall swore on behalf of the king that the grievances of the barons would be addressed in the summer, which led to the signing by the king of Magna Carta in June. Marshall later became regent during the reign of John's infant son, King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272). Henry later expressed a desire to be buried in the church and, to accommodate this, in the early 13th century the chancel of the original church was pulled down and a new larger chancel was built, the basic form of which survives today. It was consecrated on Ascension Day 1240 and comprises a central aisle and two side aisles, north and south, of identical width. The height of the vault is . Although one of Henry's infant sons was buried in the chancel, Henry himself later altered his will to reflect his new wish to be buried in Westminster Abbey. = Crown seizure = After the destruction and abolition of the Knights Templar in 1307, King Edward II took control of the church as a Crown possession. It was later given to the Knights Hospitaller, who leased the Temple to two colleges of lawyers. One college moved into the part of the Temple previously used by the Knights, and the other into the part previously used by its clergy, and both shared the use of the church. The colleges evolved into the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple, two of the four London Inns of Court. = 16th‚Äì19th centuries = An 1827 woodcut of The Temple Church The interior of the Round Church in the early 19th century In 1540 the church became the property of The Crown once again when King Henry VIII abolished the Knights Hospitaller in England and confiscated their property. Henry provided a priest for the church under the former title \\"Master of the Temple\\". In the 1580s the church was the scene of the Battle of the Pulpits, a theological conflict between the Puritans and supporters of the Elizabethan Compromise. Shakespeare was familiar with the site and the church and garden feature in his play Henry VI, part 1 as the setting for the fictional scene of the plucking of two roses of York and Lancaster and the start of the Wars of the Roses. In 2002 this event was commemorated with the planting of new white and red roses in the modern gardens. Following an agreement in 1608 by King James I, the two Inns were granted use of the church in perpetuity on condition that they should support and maintain it. They continue to use the Temple church as their ceremonial chapel. The church escaped damage in the Great Fire of London of 1666. Nevertheless, it was refurbished by Christopher Wren, who made extensive modifications to the interior, including the addition of an altar screen and the installation of the church's first organ. The church underwent a Victorian restoration in 1841 by Smirke and Burton, who decorated the walls and ceiling in high Victorian Gothic style in an attempt to return the church back to its supposed original appearance. Further restoration work was executed in 1862 by James Piers St Aubyn. = Twentieth century = Temple Church in 1914 On 10 May 1941, German incendiary bombs set the roof of the Round Church on fire,The Old Churches of London Cobb, G: London, Batsford, 1942 and the fire quickly spread to the nave and chapel. The organ and all the wooden parts of the church, including the Victorian renovations, were destroyed and the Purbeck marble columns in the chancel cracked due to the intense heat. Although these columns still provided some support to the vault, they were deemed unsound and were replaced in identical form. The original columns had a slight outward lean, which architectural quirk was followed in the replacement columns. During the renovation by the architect Walter Godfrey, it was discovered that elements of the 17th-century renovations made by Wren had survived in storage and these were replaced in their original positions. The church was rededicated in November 1958.\\"London:the City Churches\\" Pevsner, N/Bradley, S New Haven, Yale, 1998 The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. Use The interior of the Round Church facing east towards the Chancel The interior of the Chancel facing west toward the Round Church Among other purposes, the church was originally used for Templar initiation ceremonies. In England the ceremony involved new recruits entering the Temple via the western door at dawn. The initiates entered the circular nave and then took monastic vows of piety, chastity, poverty and obedience. The details of initiation ceremonies were always a closely guarded secret, which later contributed to the Order's downfall as gossip and rumours spread about possible blasphemous usages. These rumours were manipulated and exploited by the Order's enemies, such as King Philip IV of France, to fabricate a pretext for the order's suppression. Today the Temple Church holds regular church services, including Holy Communion and Mattins on Sunday morning.Service Sheet It also holds weddings, but only for members of the Inner and Middle Temples. The Temple Church serves both the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple as a private chapel. The Temple Church has always been a Peculiar (but not a Royal Peculiar), due to which the choristers have the privilege of wearing scarlet cassocks. Debate exists regarding the relationship of its status as Crown Subject and Peculiar. Relations with the Bishop of London are very good and she regularly attends events and services at the Temple Church. The Bishop of London is also ex officio Dean of the Chapel Royal. Altar and stained glass of the eastern end of the Church = Music at the Temple Church = The organ in the Temple Church The church offers regular choral music performances and organ recitals. A choir in the English cathedral tradition was established at the Temple Church in 1842 under the direction of Dr E. J. Hopkins, and it soon earned a high reputation.Lewer, David (1961). A Spiritual Song, The Story of the Temple Choir & a History of Divine Service in the Temple Church, London, The Templar's Union, ASIN B0014KQ33I In 1927, the Temple Choir under George Thalben-Ball became world-famous with its recording of Mendelssohn's Hear My Prayer, including the solo \\"O for the Wings of a Dove\\" sung by Ernest Lough. This became one of the most popular recordings of all time by a church choir, and it sold strongly throughout the twentieth century, reaching gold disc status (a million copies) in 1962 and achieving an estimated 6 million sales to date. The Temple Church's excellent acoustics have also attracted secular musicians: Sir John Barbirolli recorded a famous performance of the Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis by Ralph Vaughan Williams there in 1962 (at the suggestion of Bernard Herrmann), and Paul Tortelier made his recording of the complete Bach Cello Suites there in April 1982. In 2003 the church was the location of a music video of Libera.'When A Knight Won His Spurs by Libera (soloist: Ben Crawley); LiberaUSA, 2006 (Youtube). See also: Hever Castle and Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. While writing the score for Interstellar, film composer Hans Zimmer chose the Temple Church for the recording of the parts of the score that included an organ. The Church's organist Roger Sayer played the organ, while a large orchestra played throughout the church.Hans Zimmer Making of \\"Interstellar\\" Soundtrack (2014) Zimmer is quoted saying that \\"Setting foot into Temple Church is like stepping into profound history. ...Temple Church houses one of the most magnificent organs in the world.\\" The choir continues to record, broadcast and perform, in addition to its regular services at the Temple Church. It is an all-male choir, consisting of 18 boys who are all educated on generous scholarships (most of the boys attend the City of London School although the scholarship is portable) and 12 professional men. They perform weekly at Sunday services, 11:15‚Äì12:15 pm, during term time. The choir gave the world premiere of Sir John Tavener's epic The Veil of the Temple, which took place over seven hours during an overnight vigil in the Temple Church in 2003. The following year it was performed by the choir at the Lincoln Festival in New York City; a concert version was performed at the BBC Proms the same year. Two new recordings were released in 2010 on the Signum Classics label: one of the Temple Church Choir, and a recording of English organ music played by James Vivian. Both were critically acclaimed. The boys' choir also appears on the 2016 recording of John Rutter's violin concerto Visions, and on an album of upper-voices Christmas music released the same year. Organ The church contains two organs: a chamber organ built by Robin Jennings in 2001, and a four manual Harrison & Harrison organ, built in 1924 as a private ballroom organ at Glen Tanar Castle and installed at the Temple Church in 1954.Temple Church Choir website List of organists The church has had a number of famous organists, including: *Francis Pigott 1688‚Äì1704 *John Pigott 1704‚Äì1737 (from 1729 for Middle Temple only) Inner Temple *Obadiah Shuttleworth 1729‚Äì1734 *John Stanley 1734‚Äì1786 *Robert John Samuel Stevens 1786‚Äì1810 *George Price 1810‚Äì1814 Middle Temple *John Pigott 1729‚Äì1737 *James Vincent 1737‚Äì1749 *John Jones 1749‚Äì1796 *Emily Dowding 1796‚Äì1814 (from 1814 for both Inner and Middle Temple) *George Price 1814‚Äì1826 *George Warne 1826‚Äì1843 (afterwards organist of St Nicholas' Church, Great Yarmouth) *Dr Edward John Hopkins 1843‚Äì1897 *Sir Henry Walford Davies 1897‚Äì1923 *Sir George Thalben-Ball 1923‚Äì1982 *Dr John Birch 1982‚Äì1997 *Stephen Layton 1997‚Äì2006 *James Vivian 2006‚Äì2013 *Roger Sayer 2014‚Äì  Master of the Temple  The church always has two clergy, called the \\"Master of the Temple\\" and the \\"Reader of the Temple.\\" The title of the Master of the Temple recalls the title of the head of the former order of the Knights Templar. The Master of the Temple is appointed by the Crown; the right of appointment was reserved when the Church was granted to the two Inns by James I in 1608. The church has the status of a peculiar rather than a private chapel and is outside any episcopal or archiepiscopal jurisdiction. The present Master of the Temple is the Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, appointed in 1999. The Master gives regular lunchtime talks open to the public. The official title of the Master of the Temple is the \\"Reverend and Valiant Master of the Temple.\\" His official residence is the Master's House, a Georgian townhouse built next to the church in 1764. page 231 = Masters of the Temple = * 1540‚Äì1558‚Ä† William Ermested * 1560‚Äì1584‚Ä† Richard Alvey * 1585‚Äì1591 Richard Hooker * 1591‚Äì1601‚Ä† Nicholas Balgay * 1601‚Äì1628‚Ä† Thomas Master (as Archdeacon of Salop from 1614) * 1628‚Äì1639‚Ä† Paul Micklethwaite * 1639‚Äì1644 John Littleton (royalist, left London to join the king, ejected 1644) (1644 Richard Vines nominated by the House of Commons but rejected by the House of Lords.) * 1645‚Äì1646 John Tombes * 1646‚Äì1658 Richard Johnson * 1658‚Äì1659‚Ä† Ralph Brownrigg (as Bishop of Exeter) * 1659‚Äì1661 John Gauden (as Bishop of Exeter) * 1661‚Äì1684‚Ä† Richard Ball * 1684‚Äì1704 William Sherlock (as Dean of St Paul's from 1691) * 1704‚Äì1753 Thomas Sherlock (as Dean of Chichester 1715, Bishop of Bangor 1728, Salisbury 1734, London 1748) * 1753‚Äì1763‚Ä† Samuel Nicolls * 1763‚Äì1771‚Ä† Gregory Sharpe * 1771‚Äì1772‚Ä† George Watts * 1772‚Äì1787 Thomas Thurlow (as Dean of Rochester 1775, Bishop of Lincoln 1779) * 1787‚Äì1797 William Pearce (later Dean of Ely) * 1797‚Äì1798 Thomas Kipling (later Dean of Peterborough) * 1798‚Äì1827 Thomas Rennell (as Dean of Winchester from 1805) * 1827‚Äì1845 Christopher Benson * 1845‚Äì1869 Thomas Robinson * 1869‚Äì1894 Charles John Vaughan (as Dean of Llandaff from 1879) * 1894‚Äì1904‚Ä† Alfred Ainger * 1904‚Äì1915‚Ä† Henry George Woods * 1915‚Äì1919 Ernest Barnes (later Bishop of Birmingham) * 1919‚Äì1930 William Henry Draper * 1930‚Äì1935 Spencer Carpenter (later Dean of Exeter) * 1935‚Äì1954‚Ä† Harold Anson * 1954‚Äì1957‚Ä† John Firth * 1958‚Äì1968 Dick Milford * 1968‚Äì1980 Bobby Milburn (formerly Dean of Worcester) * 1981‚Äì1999‚Ä† Joseph Robinson * 1999‚Äì Robin Griffith-Jones Buried in the church * Sir Richard Chetwode, Sheriff of Northamptonshire (1560‚Äì1635). * Silvester de Everdon, Bishop of Carlisle and Lord Chancellor of England (died 1254). * Sir Anthony Jackson (1599‚Äì1666). * Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex (died September 1144). * William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1146‚Äì1219). * William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1190 ‚Äì 6 April 1231). * Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke (1194 ‚Äì 27 June 1241). * Dr Richard Mead (1673‚Äì1754). * William Petyt, barrister, legal scholar, and Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London (1640/1641 ‚Äì 3 October 1707). * Sir Edmund Plowden (1518‚Äì1585). * Francis James Newman Rogers (1791‚Äì1851). * John Selden (1584 ‚Äì 1654), English jurist * James Simpson (1737‚Äì1815), Attorney General of Colonial South Carolina.

A memorial dedicated to several British soldiers The Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence is a museum in Hong Kong, located in a former coastal defence fort overlooking the Lei Yue Mun channel, near Shau Kei Wan on Hong Kong Island. The fort was built by the British in 1887, intended to defend the eastern approaches to Victoria Harbour. The total area of the museum is 34,200 square metres. An exhibition entitled \\"600 years of Coastal Defence\\" is held permanently in the museum, which tells the story of the defence of the Hong Kong coastline from the time of the Ming Dynasty, through the First and Second Opium Wars and the Battle of Hong Kong, through to today. History On 8 December 1941, the Japanese launched their attacks on Hong Kong Island. After the fall of the New Territories and Kowloon, the British Forces immediately strengthened the defences at Lei Yue Mun to prevent the Japanese from crossing the Lei Yue Mun Channel from Devil's Peak. The defence forces managed to repulse several raids by the Japanese, but were eventually overwhelmed and the fort fell into enemy hands on 19 December. The fort no longer bore any defence significance in the post-war period and became a training ground for the British Forces until 1987, when it was finally vacated. In 1993 the Urban Council decided to convert the fort into a museum. It opened on 25 July 2000. Displays The museum consists of three main areas, namely the Reception area, the Redoubt, and the Historical Trail. It is converted from the hundred-year-old Lei Yue Mun Fort. Its historical structure has an extensive outdoor area with the unique architectural design, a strong tensile structure with other traditional building material, which provides a comfort and historical feeling for visitors. The casemates inside the Redoubt were converted into exhibition galleries for permanent displays on the history of Hong Kong's Coastal Defence covering the Ming and Qing period, the British period, the Japanese invasion and the period after the transfer of sovereignty to China. Historical military structures #Redoubt: It was built in 1887 and formerly the core military structure of the Lei Yue Mun Fort. #Central Battery: This battery was completed in March 1887. The gun barrel on the display is a 7-inch (17.8 cm) RML Mark 1 gun of 4.5 tons dating from the 1870s. #Western Battery: Two 9 inch (23 cm) muzzle loading guns mounted in this battery in March 1887. The barrel displayed here, which was found in the Admiralty Garden site in 1990, alone weighed 12 tons. #The torpedo station: The Brennan Torpedo station at Lei Yue Mun was built between 1892 and 1894. It was hewn out of the rock of the headland. It was the last to be constructed either in Britain or her overseas possessions. #Lei Yue Mun Pass Battery: This battery was built to defend the harbour from destroyers carrying small high- speed torpedoes; it was completed in March 1892. Transportation The museum is accessible within walking distance North East from Shau Kei Wan Station of the MTR. Status The Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence is currently closed for renovation. It is scheduled to be re-opened in 2020. During the closure, the museum will organise an array of outreach programmes.

Several credit union systems and cooperative banks have been named after Raiffeisen, who pioneered rural credit unions.  Life  Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen was born on 30 March 1818 at Hamm/Sieg (Westerwald). He was the seventh out of nine children. His father Gottfried Friedrich Raiffeisen was a farmer and also mayor of Hamm for a while. One can go back to his family‚Äôs origin until the 16th century in the Swabian- Franconian area. The family of his mother, Amalie Christiane Susanna Maria, born Lantzend√∂rffer, came from the ‚ÄúSiegerland‚Äù.\\"Internationale Raiffeisen- Union\\" .Accessed: 18-04-2011. Leaving school at the age of 14 he received three years of education from a local pastor before he entered the military at the age of 17. His career in the military-led him to Cologne, Coblenz, and Sayn. An eye disease forced him to resign from the military service in 1843 and he went into public service. He was mayor of several towns: from 1845 he was mayor of Weyerbusch/Westerwald; from 1848 he was mayor of Flammersfeld/Westerwald; and finally, he was mayor of Heddesdorf from 1852 until late 1865, when, at the age of 47, his worsening health cut his career short; he had caught typhus in 1863 during an epidemic during which his wife had died. Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen 1818-1888, Deutscher Raiffeisenverband (in German), undated .Accessed: 06-15-2008. Since his small pension was not sufficient to meet the living of Raiffeisen‚Äôs family he initially started a small cigar factory and later on wine business. In 1867, he married the widow Maria Panseroth. She outlived him by 12 years and their marriage remained childless. He died on 11 March 1888 in Neuwied-Heddesdorf, shortly before his 70th birthday.  Work  The cover of \\"Raiffeisen-Ratgeber: Die Darlehnskassen-Vereine\\" 1866 by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen. In it Raiffeisen sets out how to establish credit unions and other co-operatives. Raiffeisen conceived of the idea of cooperative self-help during his tenure as the young mayor of Flammersfeld. He was inspired by observing the suffering of the farmers who were often in the grip of loan sharks. He founded the first cooperative lending bank, in effect the first rural credit union in 1864. Motivated by the misery of the poor part of the population he founded during the starvation winter of 1846/47 the ‚ÄúVerein f√ºr Selbstbeschaffung von Brod und Fr√ºchten‚Äù (Association for Self-procurement of Bread and Fruits). He bought flour with the help of private donations. The bread was baked in a self-built bakery and distributed on credit to the poorest amongst the population. The bread society as well as the aid society founded in 1849 in Flammersfeld and the benevolent society created in 1854 in Heddesdorf were pre-cooperative societies based on the principle of benevolent assistance. To secure the liquidity equalization between the small credit banks, in 1872 Raiffeisen created the first rural central bank at Neuwied, the ‚ÄúRheinische Landwirtschaftliche Genossenschaftsbank‚Äù (Rhenish Agricultural Cooperative Bank). In 1881, Raiffeisen created a printing house in Neuwied that still exists today, carries his name and was merged in 1975 with the German cooperative publishing house ‚ÄúDeutscher Genossenschafts-Verlag‚Äù.  Philosophy  Raiffeisen stated that there is a connection between poverty and dependency. To fight poverty one should fight dependency first. Based on this idea he came up with the three 'S' formula: self-help, self-governance, and self-responsibility (in the original German: Selbsthilfe, Selbstverwaltung, and Selbstverantwortung). When put into practice, the necessary independence from charity, politics, and loan sharks could be established.Raiffeisen levensroman van een groot pionier, Rabobank Nederland Co√∂peratie & Bestuur AB, 2005.

Pinsk was taken by the advancing Red Army on 25 January 1919, during the Soviet westward offensive of 1918‚Äì19. It was retaken by Polish troops on 5 March 1919 during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War but was retaken by the Red Army on 23 July 1920 and finally retaken by the Polish on 26 September 1920. Pi≈Ñsk became part of the reborn Poland in 1920 when the Polish-Soviet War ended with the Peace of Riga, signed in March 1921.Norman Davies (2003). White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919‚Äì20. Pimlico. p. 399. . (First edition: New York, St. Martin's Press, inc., 1972.) Like many other cities in Eastern Europe, Pinsk had a significant Jewish population before World War II. According to the Russian census of 1897, out of the total number of 28,400 inhabitants, Jews were approximately 74% of the population (21,100 persons), making it one of the most Jewish cities under tsarist rule.Joshua D. Zimmerman (2004), Poles, Jews, and the Politics of Nationality. University of Wisconsin Press, , Google Books preview, p. 16. During the Polish-Soviet War, 35 Jewish civilians from Pinsk were executed by the Polish Army in April 1919 after being accused of collaborating with Russian Bolsheviks. The incident, known as the Pinsk massacre, created a diplomatic crisis noted at the Versailles Conference.Best of the memory books, Marcin Wodzinski, Haaretz, Books, February 2009, pp. 28‚Äì30 =Interwar period= Pi≈Ñsk was the initial capital of the Polesie Voivodeship, but it moved to Brze≈õƒá-nad-Bugiem (now Brest, Belarus) after a citywide fire on 7 September 1921. The population of the city grew rapidly in interwar Poland from 23,497 in 1921 to 33,500 in 1931. Pi≈Ñsk became a bustling commercial centre, and 70% of the population was Jewish, in spite of considerable migration. =Second World War= Following the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Pinsk and the surrounding area was annexed to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was the seat of the Pinsk Oblast from 1940. After Operation Barbarossa, Germany occupied Pinsk from 4 July 1941 to 14 July 1944, as part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Most Jews were killed in late October 1942 during the liquidation of the Pi≈Ñsk Ghetto by the German Ordnungspolizei and the Byelorussian Auxiliary Police, 10,000 being murdered in one day. In 1945, after postwar border adjustments of Poland, Pinsk again became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. =Post-WWII: USSR; Belarus state= In 1954 it became part of the Brest Voblast. Pinsk has formed part of the Republic of Belarus since Belarusian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Landmarks Three main sights of the town are lined along the river: the Assumption Cathedral of the Monastery of the Greyfriars (1712‚Äì1730), with a campanile from 1817, the Jesuit collegium (1635‚Äì1648); a large Mannerist complex, whose cathedral was demolished after World War II by communists; and the Butrymowicz Palace (1784‚Äì1790), built for Mateusz Butrymowicz, an important political and economical figure of Pinsk and Polesie.

Fairuz in 1946. Nouhad Haddad was born on November 20, 1934 in Lebanon into a Syriac and Maronite Christian family.FatmaAydemir, Sami Rustom: Libanesische S√§ngerin Fairouz: Die fremde Stimme, taz.de, 20. November 2014 (German) Her father was born in Mardin, Turkey. The family later moved into a home in a cobblestone alley called Zuqaq el Blatt in Beirut. Living in a single room of a typical Lebanese stone house facing Beirut's Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate school, they shared a kitchen with the neighbours. Her father Wadƒ´ ø was a Lebanese of the Syriac Orthodox faith, and worked as a typesetter in a print shop. By the age of ten, Nouhad was already known at school for her unusual singing voice. She would sing regularly during school shows and on holidays. This was how she came to the attention of Mohammed Flayfel, a well known musician and a teacher at the Lebanese Conservatory, who happened to attend one of the school's shows in February 1950. Impressed by her voice and performance, he advised her to enrol in the conservatory, which she did. At first, Nouhad's conservative father was reluctant to send her to the conservatory; however, he eventually allowed her to go on condition that her brother accompany her. Overall, Nouhad's family as a whole encouraged her in her musical career. Eastern Orthodox Annunciation Church (Arabic: ÿ≥ŸäÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ±ŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ÿ´Ÿàÿ∞ŸÉÿ≥ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅŸäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ®Ÿäÿ±Ÿàÿ™), Fairuz and Assi Rahbani surrounded by members of their families, 1955. Mohammed Flayfel took a close interest in Nouhad's talent. Among other things, he taught her to recite verses from the Koran (in the recitative style known as Tajweed). On one occasion, Nouhad was heard singing by Halim el Roumi, head of the Lebanese radio station and a prominent musician in his own right (also the father of the famous Lebanese singer Majida Roumi). Roumi was impressed by her voice and noticed that it had a rare flexibility that allowed her to sing both Arabic and Western modes admirably. At Nouhad's request, El Roumi appointed her as a chorus singer at the radio station in Beirut and went on to compose several songs for her. He chose for her the stage name Fairuz, which is the Arabic word for turquoise. A short while later, Fairuz was introduced to the Rahbani brothers, Assi and Mansour, who also worked at the radio station as musicians, and they discovered her talent. The chemistry was instant, and soon after, Assi started to compose songs for Fairouz, one of which was \\"Itab\\" (the third song he composed for her), which was an immediate smash hit in all of the Arab world, establishing Fairuz as one of the most prominent Arab singers on the Arabic music scene. Assi and Fairuz were married on January 23, 1955. The Church in, 173x173px Fairuz and Assi had four children: Ziad, a musician and a composer, Layal (died in 1987 of a brain stroke), Hali (paralysed since early childhood after meningitis) and Rima, a photographer and film director. Fairuz's first large-scale concert was in 1957, as part of the Baalbeck International Festival which took place under the patronage of the Lebanese President Camille Chamoun. She performed alongside the British prima ballerina Beryl Goldwyn and the Ballet Rambert. Fairuz was paid one Lebanese pound for that show. Musical operettas and concerts followed for many years, eventually establishing Fairuz as one of the most popular singers in Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. Career=1960s ‚Äì establishment of a new star= As the 1960s wore on, Fairuz became known as the \\"First Lady of Lebanese singing\\", as Halim Roumi dubbed her. During this period the Rahbani brothers wrote and composed for her hundreds of famous songs, most of their operettas, and three motion pictures. In 1969, Fairuz's songs were banned from the radio stations in Lebanon for six months because she refused to sing at a private concert in honour of Algerian President Houari Boumedienne. The incident only served to increase her popularity. Fairuz made it clear then and since that while always willing to sing to the public and to various countries and regions, she would never sing to any individual. =1970s ‚Äì International fame and war in Lebanon= In 1971, Fairuz's fame became international after her major North American tour, which was received with much excitement by the Arab-American and American community and yielded very positive reviews of the concerts. Fairuz in the 1970s On September 22, 1972, Assi suffered a brain haemorrhage and was rushed to the hospital. Fans crowded outside the hospital praying for him and lighting candles. After three surgeries, Assi's brain haemorrhage was halted. Ziad Rahbani, the eldest son of Fairuz and Assi, at age 16, gave his mother the music of one of his unreleased songs \\"Akhadou el Helween\\" (that he had composed to be sung by Marwan Mahfouz in \\"Sahriyyi\\" Ziad's first play) and his uncle Mansour Rahbani re-wrote new lyrics for it to be called \\"Saalouni n'Nass\\" (\\"The People Asked Me\\") which talked about Fayrouz being on stage for the first time without Assi. Three months after suffering the haemorrhage, Assi attended the premiere performance of that musical Al Mahatta in Piccadilly Theatre on Hamra Street. Elias Rahbani, Assi's younger brother, took over the orchestration and musical arrangement for the performance. Fairuz made her first European TV appearance on French TV on May 24, 1975, in a \\"Carpentier special show\\" called \\"Numero 1\\" dedicated to French star Mireille Mathieu. She sang one of her big hits \\"Habbaytak Bissayf\\" and was thanked and embraced after performing it by Mireille Mathieu. Within a year, Assi had returned to composing and writing with his brother. They continued to produce musicals, which became increasingly political in nature. After the Lebanese Civil War erupted, the brothers continued to use political satire and sharp criticism in their plays. In 1977, their musical Petra was shown in both the Muslim western and Christian eastern portions of Beirut. In 1978, the trio toured Europe and the Persian Gulf nations, including a concert at the Paris Olympia. As a result of this busy schedule, Assi‚Äôs medical and mental health began to deteriorate. Fairuz and the brothers agreed to end their professional and personal relationship in 1979. Fairuz began to work with a production team helmed by her son, Ziad Rahbani, and Assi and Mansour composed for other artists such as Ronza. During the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990), Fairuz never left Lebanon to live abroad, and did not hold any concerts there with the exception of the stage performance of the operetta Petra, which was performed in both the western and eastern parts of the then- divided Beirut in 1978. However, during that time period, Fairuz held many very successful and record-breaking concerts and tours in numerous countries around the world. =1980s ‚Äì A new production team= After the artistic divorce between Fairouz and the Rahbani brothers in 1979, Fairuz carried on with her son, composer Ziad Rahbani, his friend the lyricist Joseph Harb, and composer Philemon Wehbe. Fairuz made a second and final European Television appearance on French TV on October 13, 1988 in a show called Du c√¥t√© de chez Fred. Fairuz, who had scheduled a concert at the POPB of Paris Bercy concert hall three days later on October 16, was the main guest of French TV presenter Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand. The program features footage of her rehearsals for her concert at Bercy in addition to the ceremony featuring then French Minister of Culture Jack Lang awarding Fairuz the medal of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres. It also includes a video montage of her previous movies and concerts. In that show, Fairuz also sang the three songs \\"Ya hourri√©\\", \\"Yara\\" and \\"Zaali tawwal\\". Her first CD, The Very Best of Fairuz was published in 1987 and contained the emblematic song \\"Aatini al Nay wa ghanni\\" (Give me the flute and sing) based on a poem in \\"The Procession\\" by Khalil Gibran. It was first sung at the end of the sixties. =1990s‚Äìpresent= In the 1990s, Fairuz produced six albums (two Philemon Wehbe tributes with unreleased tracks included, a Zaki Nassif album, three Ziad Rahbani albums, and a tribute album to Assi Rahbani orchestrated by Ziad) and held a number of large-scale concerts, most notably the historic concert held at Beirut's Martyr's Square in September 1994 to launch the rebirth of the downtown district that was ravaged by the civil war. She appeared at the Baalbeck International Festival in 1998 after 25 years of self-imposed absence where she performed the highlights of three very successful plays that were presented in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1992, Madonna used some parts of Fairuz's songs in her album without permission; the singers settled the matter outside of court, but Madonna's album and single were prohibited in Lebanon. She also performed a concert in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Arena in 1999 which was attended by over 16,000 spectators, mostly Arabs. Ever since, Fairuz has held sold out concerts at the Beiteddine International Festival (Lebanon) from 2000 to 2003, Kuwait (2001), Paris (2002), the United States (2003), Amman (2004), Montreal (2005), Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Baalbeck, BIEL (2006), Athens, Amman (2007) Damascus, and Bahrain (2008). Her first album in the new millennium Wala Keef, was released in 2002. On January 28, 2008, Fairuz performed at the Damascus Opera House in an emotional return to the Syrian capital, where she played the lead role in the musical Sah el-Nom (Good Morning), after more than two decades of absence from the country, in one of a series of events highlighting UNESCO's designation of Damascus as the Capital of Arab Culture that year. Commenting on the event, the BBC wrote: \\"Every day the sun rises over Syria you hear one voice across the country ‚Äì Fairuz, the legendary Lebanese singer and greatest living Arab diva\\". Syrian historian, Sami Moubayed, said that the Syrians were thrilled about the performance and that Fairuz reminded them of the \\"good old days\\". People from all ages attended the concert and the auditorium was packed with listeners. Fairuz said that she had never seen such an audience in her life. However, her decision to perform there drew criticism from Lebanese politicians who considered Syria to be a hostile nation. Fairuz's new album entitled Eh... Fi Amal was released on October 7, 2010, produced by Fairuz productions and written entirely by her son Ziad Rahbani. Two concerts took place at BIEL Center in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 7 and 8. Later a concert in Bahrain was cancelled in March 2011. She performed in the Netherlands for the first time in Amsterdam on June 26, 2011. Fairuz's last appearance on stage was in Platea ‚Äì Jounieh ‚Äì Harer Sakher in December 2011, where she had 6 concerts extending from December 9 to 23. Fairuz released her first album in seven years titled Bebalee on September 22, 2017. On June 21, 2017, her daughter Reema Rahbany released the first single from the album \\"Lameen\\". The song is a tribute for Fairouz's late husband Assi Rahbany and was released in commemoration of his anniversary. Lameen is inspired by the French song \\"Pour qui veille l'√©toile\\" and was adapted into Arabic by Reema Rahbany. Personal life Fairouz was born to a Syriac Orthodox family. She is of the Eastern Orthodox Christian faith, having converted when she married Assi Rahbani, one of the two Rahbani brothers who helped shape her singing career. She is also the mother of the Lebanese composer, pianist and playwright Ziad Rahbani, the late director Layal Rahbani, Lebanese director Rima Rahbani, and Haley Rahbani. Controversies=2008 Damascus concert= The 2008 concert in Damascus angered some of her fans and several Lebanese politicians who described Syria as \\"enemy territory in the grip of a brutal secret police force\\". Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, accused Fairuz of \\"playing into the hands of Syrian intelligence services\\", while fellow party member Akram Chehayeb said that \\"those who love Lebanon do not sing for its jailers,\\" in reference to the three decades long Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Even some Syrian opposition activists called on her to boycott the event. This came amid a political crisis in Lebanon between pro- and anti-Syria factions, as well as a renewed Syrian government crackdown on dissent that same day during which several people were arrested, including opposition figure Riad Seif and twelve other activists of the anti-government Damascus Declaration. A poll conducted a week before the concert by NOW Lebanon, a Lebanese web portal sympathetic to the anti-Syria March 14 Alliance, showed that 67% of the respondents were opposed to Fairuz's appearance in Damascus, with one of the website's editorials saying that \\"this was not the moment for a musical love-in\\". Fairuz refrained from commenting on the controversy. However, in a letter to the event's organizers, she said that the concert should be viewed from a cultural perspective, and wrote: \\"Damascus is not a cultural capital for this year only, but will remain a role model of art, culture and authenticity for the coming generations\\". She also told the head of the organizers that she felt it was a return to her second home. Syrian commentator Ayman Abdelnour said that Fairuz was performing to the Syrian people, not their rulers. Her brother-in-law and former partner Mansour Rahbani also defended her decision to perform there, saying it was \\"a message of love and peace from Lebanon to Syria\\". =Lawsuits= Since many of the Rahbanis' works were co-written by Assi's brother Mansour, in June 2010, a year after Mansour's death in January 2009, a Lebanese court banned Fairuz from singing material that involved his contributions. The issue began when Mansour's children filed a lawsuit against Fairuz when she was set to perform the song \\"Ya'ish Ya'ish\\" at the Casino du Liban. As a result, Fairuz could not perform such works without Mansour's children's permission. The court's decision led to protests around the world in response to what her fans perceived as an act of \\"silencing\\". Hundreds gathered in front of the National Museum of Beirut, led by a number of Arab artists, including Egyptian actress Ilham Chahine who flew to Lebanon in order to join the sit-in. \\"She is a great artistic personality who has entertained millions for decades. We cannot keep silent over this humiliating attitude to her, and to art and artists in general. Fairouz to me is above all laws. She is like the mother whom, even when she errs, we are eager to forgive,\\" Chahine added. Ian Black wrote on The Guardian: \\"Outrage over her silencing has been a reminder of the extraordinary loyalty she still inspires across the region\\". Other reactions included a protest concert in Egypt, and a \\"Shame!\\" headline displayed by Emirati newspaper Al-Ittihad. =Alleged political affiliations= Fairuz's son, Ziad Rahbani, sparked controversy in December 2013 during an interview with the Al- Ahed website when asked whether his mother shared his supportive stance on the political vision of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a dominant but highly controversial political and military force in Lebanon. Ziad replied: \\"Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan [Nasrallah], although she will be displeased with me, as she was after my last television interview, when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me\\". There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media, and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words. Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: \\"Fairuz is too great to be criticized, and at the same time too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp\\". \\"Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with,\\" Jumblatt added. Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf \\"because she prefers to remain silent\\", responded to his critics by saying: \\"Apparently it isn‚Äôt allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance\\". Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: \\"An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who maybe espoused different ideologies, might disagree with you on political matters, but personally have [a] fondness for you, because of your character, conduct, sacrifices and so on. If such a person were to say that he or she liked someone, then all hell would break loose\\". Legacy and honors Fairuz is the Arab world's most famous and most listened-to singer. For decades, almost all radio stations in the Arab world have been starting their morning broadcast with a Fairuz song. The Guardian stated that \\"she sang the story of a Lebanon that never really existed\\" and \\"essentially helped build the identity of Lebanon, just 14 years after it became an independent country\\". In 1997, Billboard stated \\"even after five decades at the top, (Fairuz) remains the supreme Diva of Lebanon\\".goo.gl/376cJk In 1999, The New York Times described her as \\"a living icon without equal\\" and stated that her emergence as a singer paralleled Lebanon's transformation from a backwater to the vibrant financial and cultural heart of the Arab world. In a 2008 article, BBC described her as \\"the legendary Lebanese singer and greatest living Arab diva\\". In an article about world music, The Independent stated \\"All young female singers in this region seem to be clones of her\\" and that \\"she's such an important artist that you have to get to grips with her\\". In her performances, she is hieratic and melancholic, standing motionless in front of the microphone. When questioned by Neil MacFarquhar about her seriousness, she answered that she still feels stage fright. She claims to sing as if she were praying.Chapter 3 of The Media Relations Department of Hizbollah Wishes You a Happy Birthday: Unexpected Encounters in the Changing Middle East, Neil MacFarquhar. New York: Public Affairs Books, 2009. Fairuz was honored in many countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Tunisia, the United States, Egypt and France, in which Fran√ßois Mitterrand awarded her the Order of Arts and Letters in 1988, Jacques Chirac handed her the Legion of Honour in 1998, and Emmanuel Macron who visited her house in Rabieh awarded her the Legion of Honour (Commandeur) on 31 August 2020. Discography Fairuz possesses a large repertoire of songs. She has also been offered prestigious awards and titles over the years (see Fairuz Awards and Recognitions). Around 85 Fairuz CDs, vinyls and cassettes have been officially released so far. Most of the songs that are featured on these albums were composed by the Rahbani brothers. Also featured are songs by Philemon Wehbe, Ziad Rahbani, Zaki Nassif, Mohamed Abd El Wahab, Najib Hankash and Mohamed Mohsen. Many of Fairuz's numerous unreleased works date back to the 1950s and 1960s and were composed by the Rahbani Brothers (certain unreleased songs, the oldest of all, are by Halim el Roumi). A Fairuz album composed by Egyptian musician Riad Al Sunbati (who has worked with Umm Kulthum) was produced in 1980, but is unlikely to be released. There are also fifteen unreleased songs composed by Philemon Wehbe and 24 unreleased songs composed by Ziad Rahbani in the 1980s. Fairuz has also released an album on Folkways Records, entitled Lebanon: The Baalbek Folk Festival. Live concerts Fairuz has performed in many countries around the globe including Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Netherlands, Greece, Canada, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Italy, and her home country Lebanon. Theatrical works Musical plays or operettas were the cornerstone works of the Rahbani Trio, Fairuz, Assi and Mansour. The Rahbani Brothers produced 25 popular musical plays (20 with Fairuz) over a period of more than 30 years. They were possibly the first to produce world-class Arabic musical theatre. The musicals combined storyline, lyrics and dialogue, musical composition varying widely from Lebanese folkloric and rhythmic modes to classical, westernized, and oriental songs, orchestration, and the voice and acting of Fairuz. She played the lead roles alongside singers/actors Nasri Shamseddine, Wadih El Safi, Antoine Kerbaje, Elie Shouayri (Chouayri), Hoda (Fairuz's younger sister), William Haswani, Raja Badr, Siham Chammas (Shammas), Georgette Sayegh and many others. The Rahbani plays expressed patriotism, unrequited love and nostalgia for village life, comedy, drama, philosophy, and contemporary politics. The songs performed by Fairuz as part of the plays have become immensely popular among the Lebanese and Arabs around the world. The Fairuz-Rahbani collaboration produced the following musicals (in chronological order): * Ayyam al Hassad (Days of Harvest ‚Äì 1957) * Al 'Urs fi l‚ÄôQarya (The Wedding in the Village ‚Äì 1959) * Al Ba'albakiya (The Girl from Baalbek) ‚Äì 1961) * Jisr el Amar] (Bridge of the Moon ‚Äì 1962) * Awdet el 'Askar (The Return of the Soldiers ‚Äì 1962) * Al Layl wal Qandil] (The Night and the Lantern ‚Äì 1963) * Biyya'el Khawatem (Ring Salesman ‚Äì 1964) * Ayyam Fakhreddine (The Days of Fakhreddine ‚Äì 1966) * Hala wal Malik (Hala and the King ‚Äì 1967) * Ach Chakhs (The Person ‚Äì 1968‚Äì1969) * Jibal Al Sawwan (Sawwan Mountains ‚Äì 1969) * Ya'ich Ya'ich (Long Live, Long Live ‚Äì 1970) * Sah Ennawm (Did you sleep well? ‚Äì 1970‚Äì1971 ‚Äì 2006‚Äì2008) * Nass min Wara' (People Made out of Paper ‚Äì 1971‚Äì1972) * Natourit al Mafatih (The Guardian of the Keys ‚Äì 1972) * Al Mahatta (The Station ‚Äì 1973) * Loulou ‚Äì 1974 * Mais el Reem (The Deer's Meadow ‚Äì 1975) * Petra ‚Äì 1977‚Äì1978 Most of the musical plays were recorded and video-taped.

The Guardian. The Spiritualist Association of Great Britain (the SAGB) is a British spiritualist organisation. It was established in 1872. History The SAGB grew out of the Marylebone Spiritualist Association (founded 1872). The story of the association's early struggles \\"to propagate spiritual truths in the Marylebone area of London\\" is told in an SAGB publication, \\"One Hundred Years of Spiritualism\\", which also states that Queen Victoria allegedly held several s√©ances after the death of the Prince Consort. A famous and outspoken supporter of the SAGB was Arthur Conan Doyle, who (according to his obituary in the New York Times) in later years \\"often expressed a wish that he should be remembered for his psychic work rather than for his novels\\". Serving the principles of the Spiritualist movement, and open to members and non-members alike, the SAGB offers rooms where the public, whether Spiritualist or not, may sit for readings with spirit mediums. Sunday services are free and include a public Demonstration of mediumship. Private 30-minute sittings are available daily during opening hours for a fee. They may be recorded if the client wishes. The nature of the sittings is strictly limited by a policy which states that the mediums are \\"to try to provide evidence of survival [of the spirit after death] and not to predict the future.\\"\\"Private Sittings\\".

Beliefs As an organization, the SAGB describes their goals as: The SAGB and its mediums abide by the following seven principles of belief: * That there is an Infinite Intelligence, Who governs all * That personal identity and all sentient forms of life survive physical death * That continuous existence and eternal progress occur for all in the Hereafter * That there is communion with the spiritual realms * That all of humanity is spiritually linked * That in the Hereafter, all must account for their actions on earth and will judge themselves accordingly * That all are responsible for the way they conduct their earthly lives.\\"Principles of SAGB\\".

In 2013, the Charity Commission for England and Wales launched an investigation in to the sale of the property, after discovering that the subsequent owners sold the property for 21 million pounds shortly after purchasing it from the SAGB.

His magnum opus is a children's science fiction series Alisa Selezneva, although most of his books are adult- oriented. His books were adapted for film, TV and animation over 20 times ‚Äì more than any other Russian science fiction author ‚Äì and Bulychev himself wrote scripts for early adaptations. Biography Mozheiko (Mojeiko) received a Master's degree in 1965 and a Ph.D. in 1981. From 1963 he worked in the Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He was a specialist in the medieval history of Burma, and wrote a biography of Aung San. He first used the pseudonym Kir Bulychev in 1965, for his very first science fiction story, \\"A Girl Nothing Can Happen To\\". It was the first in what would become his most popular book series, Alisa Selezneva, that eventually comprised more than 50 novellas and short stories. This children's science fiction series is centered around the titular heroine, a teenage girl from the future, who travels through space and time, solves mysteries, makes discoveries and saves endangered peoples and species. Bulychov kept writing Alisa for the rest of his life: the last book appeared in 2003, months before his death. There were four animated and three life-action adaptations of Alisa stories, as well as tie-in comics and video games. Another of Bulychev's best- known works is a series of short stories about Veliky Guslar, a Russian town that attracts all kinds of aliens and supernatural beings. This fictional city is based on the real city of Veliky Ustyug. He also wrote many standalone science fiction novels, including The Last War (1970), Thirteen Years of Travel, Those Who Survive (adapted as the animated film Pereval), The Witches Cave (filmed), River Chronos and Abduction of the Wizard.

Anpan can also be prepared with other fillings, including white beans (shiro-an), green beans (uguisu-an), sesame (goma-an) and chestnut (kuri-an). History Anpan was first made in 1875, during the Meiji period, by a man called , a samurai who lost his job with the rise of the conscript Imperial Army and the dissolution of the samurai as a social class. The Meiji era was a period in which Japan was becoming increasingly westernized, and many samurai who lost their jobs were given work that was totally new to them. The Western role of baker was one such job. One day, while wandering around the area where many people employed in Western jobs worked, Kimura Yasubei found a young man making breads and an idea was born; the starting of the bakery named Bun'eid≈ç (ÊñáËã±Â†Ç). In 1874, he moved to Ginza and renamed the bakery Kimuraya (Êú®ÊùëÂ±ã), now Kimuraya Sohonten (:ja:Êú®ÊùëÂ±ãÁ∏ΩÊú¨Â∫ó). At that time, however, the only recipe for bread known in Japan was for making a salty and sour-tasting bread, ill-suited to Japanese tastes at the time. Yasubei wanted to make a bread that was more to Japanese tastes. Finally, he figured out how to make bread in the way of the Japanese manj≈´ ‚Äì raising the dough with the traditional sakadane liquid yeast. He then filled the bread with a bean paste wagashi and sold anpan as snacks. Anpan was very popular, not only because of its taste, but also because the Japanese were interested in anything new and foreign at this time. Later, a man named Yamaoka Tessh≈´, a chamberlain of the Meiji emperor, who loved anpan, asked the Tokugawas, the rulers of Japan before the Meiji Period, to present anpans to the emperor when visiting him. So the Tokugawas asked Yasubei to make some for the emperor. Yasubei worked hard to make the anpan and, because he also cared about their appearance, he decorated them with a salt-pickled sakura in the middle of each bun. This anpan was presented to the Meiji emperor on April 4, 1875. The Emperor told Yasubei to present him anpan every day, and because of the rumor that the Emperor ate anpan, the popularity of bread, and especially anpan, began spreading around the country. Influence on Japanese popular culture Anpan is often used as slang for recreational inhalation of paint thinner. The picture book and anime series Anpanman is about a superhero whose head is made of anpan. In the anime franchise Clannad the main character Nagisa Furukawa often mentions \\"Anpan\\" to herself. In anime Gintama, character Sagaru Yamazaki is seen eating anpan as a ritual that references famous Japanese TV detective dramas while going undercover and eventually goes insane because of it (episode 205). In the tokusatsu series Denshi Sentai Denziman, the character Daigoro Oume/DenziBlue (played by Kenji Ohba) loves anpan. Long after the series ending, he appears in the movies Gokaiger vs. Goseiger and Gokaiger vs. Gavan selling anpan. The San-X character, Kogepan, is a burnt anpan who is depressed and gets drunk from milk. The Log Horizon character Akatsuki loves anpan, but feels that it's best when accompanied by green tea. In the anime Deadman Wonderland, the prize for participating in the \\"Dogs Race\\" organized by Tamaki, is anpan. References * . * .

He was also active as a preacher, writer, artist, pacifist and social activist. Beskow published a number of collections of sermons. He also made substantial contributions as a hymn writer.  Biography  Beskow was born in Hallingeberg (now V√§stervik Municipality), Sm√•land. The son of a priest, Beskow graduated from secondary school in 1883 and got a degree in theological philosophy at Uppsala University in 1884. From 1888 to 1892, he studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. He married the children's book author Elsa Beskow in 1893 (1897?) while she was teaching at Djursholms samskola where he served as head master. Beskow was the headmaster of the newly established co-educational school in Djursholm from 1897 to 1909. They had six sons together. During this time he also worked as an artist, and earned a degree in practical theology in 1895. In 1896 he accepted an invitation from the previous year to become a preacher in Djursholm, which was being built at the time. Beskow never wholeheartedly agreed with the Swedish church's profession of faith, and was never ordained as a minister. In 1912 he founded Birkag√•rden together with Ebba Pauli. Birkag√•rden was the first of Sweden's so-called \\"settlements\\" (hemg√•rd); Beskow was director of Birkag√•rden from 1912 until 1946. He was also headmaster of the boarding school (folkh√∂gskola) at Birkag√•rden from 1916 to 1930, as well as honorary doctorate of theology at Lund University in 1918, and president of the Swedish Association for Christian Social Life (F√∂rbundet f√∂r kristet samh√§llsliv), which he established, from 1918 to 1943. Beskow was a radical pacifist. He was also involved with the campaign for women's suffrage in Sweden (which was granted in 1919), and with the labor unions. Beskow was often engaged in leading negotiations, and became a prominent negotiator.

Close to Tung Chung Road, the fort is surrounded by the villages of Sheung Ling Pei () and Ha Ling Pei (). It has a companion Tung Chung Battery on the coast. History Tung Chung Fort was originally built in the Shun Hei era (, 11741189) of the Southern Song dynasty. Smugglers on Lantau Island smuggled salt from the island to Canton City and attacked the government of the city. The government sent a navy led by King Leok Chin () to fight against the smugglers. Three hundred soldiers were stationed in Tung Chung and built the Tung Chung Fort. After three years of peace, the soldiers were called back and 150 of them were transferred to build Kowloon Walled City, in which they later stayed. During the Qing dynasty, many pirates, including the well known Cheung Po Tsai, chose the bay of Tung Chung as their base and made use of the fort. The Qing Government recovered the fort after the surrender of Cheung Po Tsai. In 1832 (or 1817 alternatively) the fort was rebuilt and garrisoned by the Right Battalion of Tai Peng to defend the coast from pirates until the lease of New Territories to Britain in 1898. The fort was then abandoned. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the fort. Tung Chung Fort went through several transformations later. It served as a police station and then as Wa Ying College. Now, it is the base for the Rural Committee Office and the Tung Chung Public School. In 1979, it was declared a monument and was refurbished in 1988. Features North gate There are six still intact old muzzle-loading cannons, each resting on a cement base with enclosures made of granite blocks, which measure . Three arched gateways, each engraved with a Chinese inscription, are spaced along the walls. Transportation The fort can be reached from Mui Wo (Silvermine Bay) bus terminal by taking the no. 3 bus to the Tung Chung terminus and about a half mile walk from the bus stop in the direction of the fort. The fort can also be reached by taking the no. 13 or 14 bus and MTR. Permission is required to drive into the park.

It was created, produced, and edited by Jed MacKay. Approximately 180 episodes were produced from 1993 to 2001, all produced by MacKay and directed by Michael McNamara. The series won a Gemini Award from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television in 2000 for \\"Best Pre-School Program or Series\\". About The series is based on Polka Dot Door, and stars the characters Polkaroo, Humpty, Dumpty, Marigold and Bear. The characters are portrayed by \\"physical theater\\" actors in large costumes; Marigold's performer, for example, had a ballet and circus background. Charles P. Schott (\\"Bear\\") was a Gemini Awards finalist for \\"Best Performer in a Pre-School Series\\" in 2002. Originally, each episode started with a human host (Deborah Drakeford) introducing the episode to a gathering of children as she was about to read the story from a book. The stories themselves were dramatized by actors in large suits, playing the puppets from Polka Dot Door, while the reader provided the dialogue. A new character was added to the Polka Dot Door family: Polkaroo's pet, Bibble. Although Bibble was only capable of making sounds that loosely resembled \\"bibblebibblebibble\\", he did so in various tones which indicated his mood. At one point in every episode, one or more of the characters would discover a large pair of polka dot shorts, and exclaim, \\"A great big pair of polka dot shorts! How did they get there?\\" Polkaroo's response would be, \\"I haven't the foggiest!\\" Some episodes were done entirely in rhyme, in which case the character who found the polka dot shorts would exclaim, \\"Polka dot shorts, a great big pair! How on earth did they get there?\\" After the first two seasons the episodes were re-edited. The human hostess/storyteller was deleted, and the show would begin immediately. The show has been broadcast on the BBC in the UK as well as being released on video by Abbey Home Media. Characters Polkaroo (voiced by Andrew Sabiston): A green kangaroo-like animal with yellow hair, a long yellow furry tail, a red-and-yellow polka dot on his neck and a gown covered in polka dots. He appears in every episode. He lives in a small house with his pet Bibble. He enjoys having his friends round to play and is mostly the one who finds the polka dot shorts. He sometimes talks in rhyme, and when his friends argue or do something he doesn't like, he often interrupts them with \\"Excuse me\\". Bibble: Polkaroo's mischievous pet which looks like a multi-coloured mop head covered in pom-poms. Often seen moving about making a \\"bibbly\\" sound, hence his name. He likes to pull pranks, and sometimes annoys the others with them. Humpty (voiced by Tony Daniels): A big green egg with purplish hair and a white nose. He wears a burgundy coloured suit patterned with pink roses, a tie with a large H on it, and green boots. Humpty is playful and sometimes a bit mischievous, but he always goes out of his way to help his friends. When the gang start to feel scared or nervous, he often says \\"Pull yourself together.\\" He is Dumpty's older brother. Dumpty (played by Brunella Battista, voiced by Julie Lemieux): Humpty's younger brother. He is brown coloured with a blue checked nose. He wears a cream-coloured cap with the letter D on it, a blue bow tie and a blue suit with flowers and checks on it. The youngest of the group, he loves to help and wants to fit in. He sometimes annoys his older brother Humpty, but deeply cares for him. Bear (voiced by Brian Moffatt): A brown bear who wears a green bow tie with white polka dots. He has a great fondness for honey, speaks with a posh accent, and can sometimes be a bit of a show-off. He often says \\"Coincidence, I think not.\\" Marigold (played by Alisa Walton, voiced by Deborah Drakeford): A kindhearted doll with orange yarn-like hair in pigtails. She wears a green dress with flowers on it, and yellow-and- white striped leggings. She loves gardening and grows many different plants. She often says \\"You know what? I'll tell you what.\\" Episodes 1994 Goodnight Polkaroo The Ball That Got Broken Just For Two 1995 A Windy Day Lots Of Spots Sandwich Seasons Greetings Polkaroo 1996 Badge Of Merit Bibbles Birthday Knock On Wood Pardon My Garden The Wonderful Marvellous Thing A Me Jig 2004 A Champion Chompet See also *Gis√®le's Big Backyard, a segment on TVO Kids where the characters appeared after this show ended External links * Category:TVOntario original programming Category:Canadian television shows featuring puppetry Category:Canadian television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Sentient toys in fiction Category:Canadian preschool education television series Category:1993 Canadian television series debuts Category:2001 Canadian television series endings Category:English- language television shows Category:Television series produced in Toronto Category:1990s Canadian children's television series Category:2000s Canadian children's television series Category:Television series about bears ","title":"Polka Dot Shorts"},{"id":"484647","text":"Acqueville is a former commune in the Manche department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.
