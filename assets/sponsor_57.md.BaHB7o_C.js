Many members of the Royal Family who undertake public duties have separate households. They vary considerably in size, from the large Royal Household which supports the Sovereign to the household of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with fewer members. In addition to the royal officials and support staff, the Sovereign's own household incorporates representatives of other estates of the Realm, including the Government, the Military, and the Church. Government whips, defence chiefs, several clerics, scientists, musicians, poets, and artists hold honorary positions within the Royal Household. In this way, the Royal Household may be seen as having a symbolic, as well as a practical, function: exemplifying the Monarchy's close relationship with other parts of the Constitution and of national life.  Historical overview  The sovereign's domestics were his officers of state, and the leading dignitaries of the palace were the principal administrators of the kingdom. The royal household itself had, in its turn, grown out of an earlier and more primitive \\"thegnhood\\", and among the most eminent and powerful of the king's thegns were his \\"dishthegn,\\" his \\"bowerthegn,\\" and his horsethegn or staller. In Normandy at the time of the Conquest a similar arrangement, imitated from the French court, had long been established, and the Norman dukes, like their overlords the kings of France, had their seneschal or steward, their chamberlain and their constable. After the Norman Conquest, the ducal household of Normandy was reproduced in the royal household of England; and since, in obeisance to the spirit of feudalism, the great offices of the first had been made hereditary, the great offices of the second were made hereditary also, and were thenceforth held by the grantees and their descendants as holder of tenure in grand serjeanty of the crown. The consequence was that they passed out of immediate relation to the practical conduct of affairs either in both state and court or in the one or the other of them. The steward and Lord High Chamberlain of England were superseded in their political functions by the Justiciar and Treasurer of England, and in their domestic functions by the Lord Steward and Lord Chamberlain of the household. The marshal of England took the place of the constable of England in the royal palace, and was associated with him in the command of the royal armies. The marshalship and the constableship became hereditary, and, although the Lord High Constable and Earl Marshal of England retained their military authority until a comparatively late period, the duties they had performed about the palace had been long before transferred to the master of the horse. In these circumstances the holders of the original great offices of state and the household ceased to attend the court except on occasions of extraordinary ceremony, and their representatives either by inheritance or by special appointment have ever since continued to appear at coronations and some other public solemnities, such as the State Opening of Parliament or trials by the House of Lords. The earliest record relating to the English royal household is of the reign of Henry II and is contained in the Black Book of the Exchequer. It enumerates the various inmates of the king's palace and the daily allowances made to them at the period at which it was compiled. It affords evidence of the antiquity and relative importance of the court offices to which it refers, though it is silent as to the functions and formal subordination of the persons who filled them. In addition to this record, there are more recent but (for the most part) equally meagre, documents bearing on the constitution of the royal household, and extending, with long intervals, from the reign of Edward III to the reign of William III and Mary II.* Society of Antiquaries of London (1790): A collection of ordinances and regulations for the government of the royal household, made in divers reigns : from King Edward III to King William and Queen Mary, also receipts in ancient cookery, accessed 11 October 2013. This contains a collection of primary sources, including the Liber Nigra of Edward IV and the Statutes of Eltham. Among them, however, are what are known as the Black Book of the Household and the Statutes of Eltham, the first compiled in the reign of Edward IV and the second in the reign of Henry VIII from which a good deal of detailed information is available concerning the arrangements of the court in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Statutes of Eltham were meant for the practical guidance of those who were responsible for the good order and the sufficient supply of the sovereign's household at the time they were issued. The great officers of state and the household specifically mentioned are not all of them. We have named those only whose representatives are still dignitaries of the court and functionaries of the palace. If the reader consults Hallam (Middle Ages, i. 181 seq.), Freeman (Norman Conquest, i. 91 seq., and v. 426 seq.) and Stubbs (Const. Hist. i. 343, seq.), he will be able himself to fill in the details of the outline we have given above. But the Black Book of the Household, besides being a sort of treatise on princely magnificence generally, professes to be based on the regulations established for the governance of the court by Edward III, who, it affirms, was \\"the first setter of among his , upon a grounded rule\\" and whose palace it describes as \\"the house of very and of England\\"; and it may therefore possibly, and even probably, take us back to a period much more remote than that at which it was actually put together. Various orders, returns and accounts of the reigns of Elizabeth, James I, Charles I, Charles II, and William and Mary throw considerable light on the organisation of particular sections of the royal household in times nearer to our own. Moreover, there were several parliamentary inquiries into the expenses of the royal household in connection with the settlement or reform of the civil list during the reigns of George III, George IV and William IV. But they add little or nothing to our knowledge of the subject in what was then its historical as distinguished from its contemporary aspects. So much, indeed, is this the case that, on the accession of Queen Victoria, Chamberlayne's Present State of England, which contains a catalogue of the officials at the court of Queen Anne, was described by Lord Melbourne the prime minister as the \\"only authority\\" which the advisers of the crown could find for their assistance in determining the appropriate constitution and dimensions of the domestic establishment of a queen regnant. In its main outlines the existing organisation of the royal household is essentially the same as it was under the Tudors or the Plantagenets. It is divided into three principal departments, at the head of which are the lord steward, the lord chamberlain and the master of the horse, and the respective provinces of which may be generally described as \\"below stairs,\\" \\"above stairs\\" and \\"out of doors.\\" The duties of these officials, and the various officers under their charge are dealt with in the articles under those headings. When the reigning sovereign is a queen, the royal household is in some other respects rather differently arranged from that of a king and a queen consort. When there is a king and a queen consort there is a separate establishment \\"above stairs\\" and \\"out of doors\\" for the queen consort. She has a Lord Chamberlain's department of her own, and all the ladies of the court from the Mistress of the Robes to the Maids of Honour are in her service. At the commencement of the reign of Queen Victoria the two establishments were combined, and on the whole considerably reduced. On the accession of Edward VII the civil list was again reconstituted; and while the household of the king and his consort became larger than during the previous reign, there was a tendency towards increased efficiency by abolishing certain offices which were either redundant or unnecessary. The Royal Household today = The three Great Officers of the Household = The Great Officers of the Household are, in order of seniority, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlain and the Master of the Horse. Nowadays only the Lord Chamberlain fulfils an executive function; but the other two continue to have a ceremonial role, and are to be seen particularly on State occasions. = The Lord Chamberlain = As currently arranged, the Royal Household is coordinated by the part-time Lord Chamberlain (The Earl Peel since 12 October 2006), and organised into a number of functionally separate units. =Heads of departments= The Private Secretary to the Sovereign (Edward Young since 2017), under whom works the Private Secretary's Office, but who also has control of the Press Office, the Queen's Archives, and the Defence Services Secretary's Office, serves as principal advisor to the Sovereign and the principal channel of communication between the Sovereign and his or her Governments. Besides these, he also manages the Sovereign's official programme and correspondence The Keeper of the Privy Purse has responsibility for the Sovereign's personal finances and those to do with semi-private concerns, along with, as Treasurer to the Queen oversight of the civil list. The two positions are held together and, since 2018, they have both been held by Sir Michael Stevens. The Master of the Household, since 2013, has been Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt who has overall responsibility for the domestic workings of the Household. The Lord Chamberlain's Office, led by its comptroller (since 2006 Sir Andrew Ford ), is responsible for official royal occasions. The Royal Collection is overseen by its director (since February 2018, Tim Knox). = Other units = The Royal Almonry, Ecclesiastical Household, and Medical Household are functionally separate but for accounting purposes are the responsibility of the Keeper of the Privy Purse and Treasurer to the Queen. The Crown Equerry has day-to-day operation of the Royal Mews, and is part of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. The other equerries have a very different role: attending and assisting the Queen in her official duties from day to day. (Historically, they too were part of the mews, but today they are entirely separate.) The Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood is also under the Lord Chamberlain's Office, as is the office of the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps. The College of Arms has been a branch of the Royal Household since its incorporation in 1484 by King Richard III it was directly appointed by the Sovereign on the recommendation of Earl Marshal. The college is a corporation of thirteen royal heralds, overseen by the Earl Marshal, a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk. The college is self-supporting and receives no funds from the Crown. The college holds jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to heraldry, genealogy, and pedigrees in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and in some Commonwealth realms. Certain independent and honorific posts include Master of the Queen's Music, Piper to the Sovereign, Poet Laureate, and Astronomer Royal. The Queen's Bargemaster, the Keeper of the Jewel House, the Serjeants-at-Arms, and the Warden and Marker of the Swans, perform less celebrated functions. The offices of Treasurer of the Household, Comptroller of the Household, and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household are held by senior government whips in the House of Commons. In the House of Lords, the Government Chief Whip is usually appointed Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms and the Deputy Chief Whip as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, with junior whips appointed as lords-in-waiting and baronesses-in- waiting. Occasionally these officers are called upon to undertake Household duties, especially the Vice-Chamberlain, who is responsible for writing regular parliamentary reports for the Queen. The ladies-in-waiting, who are in personal attendance on the Queen on a daily basis, are formally styled either ladies of the bedchamber or women of the bedchamber. They are notionally overseen by the Mistress of the Robes ‚Äì historically the senior female member of the Royal Household, but today a ceremonial position. The Household includes a number of honorary military appointments: the aides-de-camp to the Queen (who are usually very high-ranking officers of the three armed services), the two Gold Sticks and the Vice Admiral and Rear Admiral of the United Kingdom. In addition, the two corps of royal bodyguards (the Gentlemen at Arms and the Yeomen of the Guard) are part of the Household. Gentlemen ushers are unpaid members of the Royal Household, often retired military officers, who provide occasional assistance as marshals at royal events. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is an important official in the Houses of Parliament; but technically he too is a member of the Royal Household (and acts as the Queen's messenger at the State Opening). The royal residences (see list of British royal residences) in current use are cared for and maintained by the Royal Household Property Section directly from the grant-in-aid provided by Parliament, whereas Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House are privately owned and maintained. The unoccupied royal residences (including the Tower of London) are run by the Historic Royal Palaces Agency, which is self- funding. The Scottish Royal Household The Royal Household in Scotland includes offices of personal, honorary and state appointments. Many appointments are vacant having fallen into abeyance; been abolished or returned to The Crown; merged with other positions both before and after the Union of the Crown with England; or due to lack of a clear office holder. The Great Officers of the Royal Household, (not to be confused with the Great Officers of State of Scotland which are political and judicial appointments, or the Officers of the Crown of Scotland though some officers are shared) are:Chamberlayne, Edward and John Chamberlayne.

At the time of their 2009 annual review the Office of the Prince of Wales had the full- time equivalent of 121 staff.Not including the young Princes' staff. Including their staff, there are 125.3, as listed at: The Prince of Wales ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions The head of the Household is the Principal Private Secretary, Clive Alderton. Senior officials include the Deputy Private Secretary, a senior diplomat seconded from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office to advise The Prince on Foreign and Commonwealth affairs, currently Scott Furssedonn-Wood; Master of the Household, Earl of Rosslyn; the Treasurer, Andrew Wright; Communications Secretary, Julian Payne; KCVO; and the Equerry, Commander Iain Kearsley RN. In 2000, the Prince revived a tradition of having an official harpist, a role last seen under Queen Victoria. The first holder of the office was Catrin Finch, followed in 2004 by Jemima Phillips, and in 2007 by Claire Jones. The Prince of Wales' Office is principally based at Clarence House, London, but also occupies rooms in the rest of St James's Palace. There are also offices for official staff at Highgrove House and Birkhall House, The Prince of Wales's private residences. Most of the expenses incurred in operating the office comes from The Prince of Wales's private appanage, the Duchy of Cornwall. The only significant costs met by grant-in-aid provided by the Government is for the upkeep of Clarence House, and for official travel by air and rail, and for communications support. Details of The Prince's Senior Staff are available in his office's annual reports. The following titles all have \\"to/of The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall\\" suffixed when written in full.

In January 2009, a separate Household of Prince William and Prince Harry was established (formally \\"The Household of His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales and His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales\\"), headed by Lowther-Pinkerton. Following the marriages of both princes, the Household also additionally served their wives. The Household's offices are currently based in Kensington Palace, having formerly been based in St James's Palace. The Household, as of 2011, had the equivalent of 7.8 full-time staff. It was announced in June 2011 that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would temporarily move their official London residence to an apartment in Kensington Palace, a move that was completed in August of that year. The Duke and Duchess' primary residence continued to be the island of Anglesey in Wales, where the Duke served as an RAF search and rescue pilot. The couple previously shared an apartment at Clarence House with Prince Harry, which Prince Harry will retain. On 6 November 2011, it was announced that the Duke, Duchess and Prince Harry, along with the Queen and the Prince of Wales, had approved a plan that would have the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge permanently move to a larger apartment in Kensington Palace in 2013, after it is renovated. This apartment was previously occupied by the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon and her husband Antony Armstrong-Jones, Earl of Snowdon after their marriage in 1960. The apartment was retained by Princess Margaret after her divorce in 1978 and was her London residence until her death in 2002. Prince Harry then moved his official residence from Clarence House to the apartment vacated by the Duke and Duchess. In addition, once the move is complete, their official household was also moved to Kensington Palace from St James's Palace, although the household remained shared. Until the moves were complete, their Household remained based at St James's Palace and continued to be shared. It was later announced in early May 2013 that the royal couple's private secretary, James Lowther-Pinkerton, intends to leave his post as private secretary for the private sector, and his position will be split with each member of the household receiving a private secretary. In September 2013, Miguel Head became Private Secretary to the Duke of Cambridge and Rebecca Deacon assumed the role of Private Secretary to the Duchess of Cambridge.

The first authentic fact in his career is his election as abbot, the year 1142, to succeed Adelhelm in the newly established monastery of Engelberg in the Canton of Unterwalden, Switzerland. Through his efforts the possessions and privileges, civil and ecclesiastical, of the abbey were greatly increased, while its renown as a home of learning, art, and piety spread far and wide. He established a famous school in his abbey, in which besides the trivium and quadrivium, philosophy and theology were likewise taught. The library which he collected possessed, for those days, a vast number of manuscripts. According to a list that he left, it contained Homer, Cicero, Cato, Ovid and other authors of antiquity. This rich collection perished in 1729, when the abbey was destroyed by fire. Works Frowin not only copied books for his library, but composed several. Two of these, a commentary on the Lord's Prayer, and a treatise in seven books, \\"De Laude Liberi Arbitrii\\" (\\"In Praise of Free Will\\", but in reality a discussion of the chief theological questions of his day, directed, it is thought, against the errors of Abelard) are still extant, having been discovered by Mabillon in the archives of Einsiedeln.

Vals Im Bashir) is a 2008 Israeli animated war documentary drama film written, produced and directed by Ari Folman. It depicts Folman in search of his lost memories of his experience as a soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War. This film and $9.99, also released in 2008, are the first Israeli animated feature-length films released theatrically since Alina and Yoram Gross's Joseph and the Dreamer (1962). Waltz with Bashir premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where it entered the competition for the Palme d'Or, and since then has won and been nominated for many additional important awards while receiving wide acclaim from critics and audience alike, which has praised its themes, animation, direction, story and editing. It has grossed over $11 million against a production budget of only $2 million and it has won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film,Golden Globes an NSFC Award for Best Film, a C√©sar Award for Best Foreign Film and an IDA Award for Feature Documentary, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film,Bashir Makes Oscar CutAnimation Magazine a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and an Annie Award for Best Animated Feature. Plot In 1982, Ari Folman was a 19-year-old IDF infantry soldier. In 2006, he meets with a friend from that period named Boaz, who tells him of the nightmares he's having connected to his experiences from the Lebanon War. Boaz describes 26 madly angry dogs, running towards his house through Tel Aviv main streets, destroying everything in their way. Boaz explains that during the war, his role was to shoot the dogs when the unit infiltrated villages at night, so that these dogs will not alarm the village of their arrival, and so the dogs in his dream are the souls of the very dogs he himself has killed. Boaz further explains he was chosen to do his job as he was witnessing a special mental difficulty to shoot people. Folman is surprised to find that he recalls nothing from that period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, the reality of which he is unable to clearly recall. In his memory, he and his soldier comrades are bathing at night by the seaside in Beirut under the light of flares descending over the city. Folman rushes off to meet a childhood friend, who is a professional therapist. His friend advises him to seek out others who were in Beirut at the same time, to understand what happened there and to revive his own memories. The friend further explains that as for the nature of human memory, the vision might not be based on events which actually occurred. Later on, he explains to Folman that even though the vision might be an hallucination, the vision still deals with matters of great importance for his inner world. Folman converses with friends and other soldiers who served in the war, among others a psychologist, and Israeli TV reporter Ron Ben-Yishai, who covered Beirut at the time. Folman eventually realizes that he \\"was in the second or third ring\\" of soldiers surrounding the Palestinian refugee camp where the carnage was perpetrated, and that he was among those soldiers firing flares into the sky to illuminate the refugee camp for the Lebanese Christian Phalange militia perpetrating the massacre inside. He concludes that his amnesia stemmed from his feeling as a teenage soldier that he was as guilty of the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with animation dissolving into actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre. Cast The film contains both completely fictional characters and adaptations of actual people. * Ari Folman as himself, an Israeli filmmaker who recently finished his military reserve service. Some twenty years before, he served in the IDF during the Lebanon War. * Miki Leon as Boaz Rein-Buskila, an accountant and Israeli Lebanon War veteran suffering from nightmares. * Ori Sivan as himself, an Israeli filmmaker who previously co-directed two films with Folman and is his long-time friend. * Yehezkel Lazarov as Carmi Can'an, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran who once was Folman's friend and now lives in the Netherlands. Carmi chose to be a combat soldier to prove his masculinity, but testifies that, after the war, \\"he could be nobody\\" - a response to Folman's remark that he (Can'an) was expected to excel in science. * Ronny Dayag, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran and high food engineer. During the war, he was a Merkava tank crewman. Dayag testifies that instead of returning fire when the commander of his tank was shot, he and his crew were shocked and tried to escape. His battalion left, but Dayag felt as if it was him who abandoned his battalion, because he did not act as a proper soldier. * Shmuel Frenkel, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran. During the war he was the commander of an infantry unit. By interviewing Frenkel, Folman understands that his mind deleted and repressed the fact his company confronted a boy with an RPG, whom they were forced to kill. Later on, Frenkel is shown in a scene where the soldiers are under surprise enemy fire from Beirut's rooftops by the shore. Frenkel seemingly lives up to the ideal, but this is depicted as \\"some sort of trance\\", when he forcefully takes his fellow's MAG and \\"waltzes\\" between enemy bullets, with Bashir's image in the background. * Zahava Solomon, an Israeli psychologist and researcher in the field of psychological trauma. Zahava provides professional analysis for some events in the movie, using clinical terms. For example, Zahava explains that Folman's confrontation with the RPG kid was forgotten because his brain used a defence mechanism called dissociation. She further illustrates the mechanism with an example of a past patient of hers, who was a photographer in that war. At some point, his dissociation ceased to work and he lost his mind. * Ron Ben-Yishai, an Israeli journalist who was the first to cover the massacre. * Dror Harazi, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran. During the war, he commanded a tank stationed outside the Shatila refugee camp. Title Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64 no. 2 performed by L. Faulkner The film takes its title from a scene in which Shmuel Frenkel, one of the interviewees and the commander of Folman's infantry unit at the time of the film's events, grabs a general purpose machine gun and \\"dances an insane waltz\\" (to the tune of Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor) amid heavy enemy fire on a Beirut street festooned with huge posters of Bashir Gemayel. The title also refers to Israel's short-lived political waltz with Bashir Gemayel as president of Lebanon. Production The film took four years to complete. It is unusual in it being a feature-length documentary made almost entirely by the means of animation. It combines classical music, 1980s music, realistic graphics, and surrealistic scenes together with illustrations similar to comics. The entire film is animated, excluding one short segment of news archive footage. The animation, with its dark hues representing the overall feel of the film, uses a unique style invented by Yoni Goodman at the Bridgit Folman Film Gang studio in Israel. The technique is often confused with rotoscoping, an animation style that uses drawings over live footage, but is actually a combination of Adobe Flash cutouts and classic animation.Waltz with Bashir , DG Design Each drawing was sliced into hundreds of pieces which were moved in relation to one another, thus creating the illusion of movement. The film was first shot in a sound studio as a 90-minute video and then transferred to a storyboard. From there 2,300 original illustrations were drawn based on the storyboard, which together formed the actual film scenes using Flash animation, classic animation, and 3D technologies.Israeli filmmakers head to Cannes with animated documentary [VIDEO], Israel21c.org The original soundtrack was composed by minimalist electronic musician Max Richter while the featured songs are by OMD (\\"Enola Gay\\"), PiL (\\"This is Not a Love Song\\"), Navadey Haukaf (◊†◊ï◊ï◊ì◊ô ◊î◊ê◊ï◊õ◊£ \\"Good Morning Lebanon\\", written for the film), Haclique (\\"Incubator\\"), and Zeev Tene (a remake of the Cake song \\"I Bombed Korea\\", retitled \\"Beirut\\").

The film itself was adapted into a graphic novel in 2009.Ari Folman (author), David Polonsky (Illustrator), Waltz with Bashir: A Lebanon War Story (Atlantic Books, 1 March 2009). Release Waltz with Bashir opened in the United States on 25 December 2008 in a mere five theaters, where it grossed $50,021 in the first weekend. By the end of its run on 14 May 2009, the film had grossed $2,283,849 in the domestic box office. Overseas, Waltz earned $8,842,000 for a worldwide total of $11,125,849. =Critical response= , the film holds a 96% \\"fresh\\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 151 critics for an average of 8.36/10; the general consensus states: \\"A wholly innovative, original, and vital history lesson, with pioneering animation, Waltz With Bashir delivers its message about the Middle East in a mesmerizing fashion.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 91/100 based on 33 critics, indicating ‚Äúuniversal acclaim‚Äù. IndieWire named the film the tenth best of the year, based on the site's annual survey of 100 film critics. Xan Brooks of The Guardian called it \\"an extraordinary, harrowing, provocative picture.\\" The film was praised for \\"inventing a new cinematographic language\\" at the Tokyo Filmex festival. The World Socialist Web Site's David Walsh described it as a \\"painfully honest\\" anti-war film and \\"one of the most extraordinary and haunting films at the Toronto film festival.\\" Despite the positive critical reception, the film was only moderately commercially successful in Israel itself.The \\"Waltz with Bashir\\" Two-Step. Hillel Halkin. Commentary Magazine. March 2009. Several writers described it as part of the Israeli \\"shooting and crying\\" tradition (where soldiers express remorse about their actions but do not do anything concrete to remedy the situation), but Folman disputed this. =Lebanon screening= The film is banned in some Arab countries (including Lebanon), with the most harsh critics in Lebanon, as the film depicts a vague and violent time in Lebanon's history. A movement of bloggers, among them the Lebanese Inner Circle, +961 and others have rebelled against the Lebanese government's ban of the film, and have managed to get the film seen by local Lebanese critics, in defiance of their government's request on banning it. The film was privately screened in January 2009 in Beirut in front of 90 people. Since then many screenings have taken place. Unofficial copies are also available in the country. Folman saw the screening as a source of great pride: \\"I was overwhelmed and excited. I wish I could have been there. I wish one day I'll be able to present the film myself in Beirut. For me, it will be the happiest day of my life.\\" =Top ten lists= The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. * 1st ‚Äì Ella Taylor, LA Weekly * 1st ‚Äì Stephen Farber, The Hollywood Reporter * 2nd ‚Äì Andrea Gronvall, Chicago Reader * 2nd ‚Äì Andrew O'Hehir, Salon * 3rd ‚Äì Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune#285: Top 10 Films of 2009‚ÄîFilmspotting * 4th ‚Äì Christy Lemire, Associated PressChristy Lemire's best movies of 2008 - Orange County Register * 4th ‚Äì Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly * 5th ‚Äì J.

He is best known as the guitarist of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He was a member of the group from July 1977 until September 1979. He played a \\"jagged unorthodox chording\\", and created a \\"metal-shard roar\\" with his guitar. Q magazine included McKay's work on \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever\\". He recorded two studio albums with the group, their debut album The Scream in 1978 and the sophomore album Join Hands in 1979. McKay has been cited as a influence by several guitarists including Geordie Walker, Steve Albini, Thurston Moore, Johnny Marr, Jim Reid, Kevin Shields and Boz Boorer. Siouxsie and the Banshees (1977‚Äì1979) His first studio recording with the band was a session for John Peel on BBC radio in November 1977. McKay composed the tune of their first hit single, \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" as well as much of the material found on the band's first two albums, 1978's The Scream and 1979's Join Hands. He's a self-taught musician. Music historian Nick Kent wrote that McKay had \\"a bent for more adventurous guitar styles involving minor/diminished seventh chord work\\". Journalist Scott Calhoun wrote that \\"McKay made use of harmonics as means of artistic expression as well as way of creating textures related to new approaches in the use of the electric guitar\\". On certain tracks on The Scream such as \\"Jigsaw Feeling\\", he had a bell-like sound quality. He also used two-note chords on several songs of Join Hands. McKay also played saxophone on the songs \\"Switch\\", \\"Regal Zone\\" and \\"Playground Twist\\". He left the band in September 1979 after the release of Join Hands. He later briefly led a trio named Zor Gabor, which released one three-song 12\\" EP, Tightrope, in 1987 on the In Tape label. It was reviewed \\"record of the week\\" by NME. Guitars and effects McKay used different audio effects including fuzz (to create distortion) and flanger. Peer John Valentine Carruthers said that McKay \\"had no conventional skill in guitar playing, like chords or lines. He must have had hands like a gorilla because he was playing chords like this (stretches hand right out). I've no idea what they were, and you couldn't tell by listening because they were going through fuzz and flangers.\\" His guitars were a Hagstr√∂m Semi Acoustic and a Gibson Les Paul. Mckay's effects included Fender Twin Reverb and MXR Flanger. He played metallic guitar. Legacy He has influenced several post-punk, noise, indie and alternative rock guitarists including Geordie Walker, Thurston Moore, Steve Albini, Jim Reid, Johnny Marr, Kevin Shields and Boz Boorer. Geordie Walker of Killing Joke said: \\"The guy's been ripped off so much, he started that flanged chord thing\\". Walker hailed McKay for his style on The Scream: \\"he came out with these chord structures that I found very refreshing\\". In an article published in Matter magazine in 1984, Steve Albini wrote an \\"all-time non-comprehensive good guitar list\\", and included McKay in the section titled \\"Noise\\" saying : \\"The Scream is notable for a couple of things: only now people are trying to copy it, and even now nobody understands how that guitar player got all that pointless noise to stick together as songs\\".Albini, Steve. (September - October 1984). \\"Tired of Ugy Fat ?\\". Matter [a Music Magazine] (10). Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain praised The Scream - era, and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine cited the Banshees-MkI as one of his early influences, and he \\"saw the Banshees in Ireland in 1979\\". Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" as one of his 25 all-time favourite songs. McKay is also revered by other musicians such as Johnny Marr of the Smiths and Boz Boorer (Morrissey's guitarist and arranger). When asked \\"who do you regret not going to see live\\", Marr replied \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees mk 1\\". Boorer cited him as a \\"big influence on my playing [...] That first Siouxsie record was quite incredible sounding, and it started me in thinking that music didn‚Äôt have to be any certain way‚Äîthat there could be many different influences in music and it didn‚Äôt have to be a single, strict avenue. That first Banshees album has a lot of jarring guitar that rubs against what you‚Äôd think was going to or maybe should happen over a part\\". In a live review, music historian Jon Savage likened Joy Division's guitarist Bernard Sumner to McKay in 1979, saying that Sumner \\"was using a lot of distortion and noise in quite a melodic way. The only other person I could think of who was doing that then was John McKay from Siouxsie and the Banshees\\". When journalist Simon Reynolds interviewed Lydia Lunch saying there was this starkness of sound on certain Teenage Jesus songs that reminded him Siouxsie and the Banshees' circa The Scream, she replied \\"I loved the guitar work on their records\\".

Plot  Undercover cop Nick Dunbar's (Arliss Howard) brother Matt (Loren Dean) is accused of killing his teacher, Mr. Bradwood (Mack Harrell) at Adlai Stevenson High School. Nick loses his temper with Hechtor (Larry Pine), the detective in charge, and gets suspended. Nick's partner Ed (Seymour Cassel) pretends to be Nick's dad to enroll him as a student. Matt gives Nick pointers to get people to talk to him. Nick deals with bullies, girls with crushes on him, teachers and staff who range from quirky to bizarre, and a teacher, Robin Torrence (Suzy Amis), to whom he is attracted who thinks he is a teen. The turning point in his popularity (and therefore his ability to get information) happens in the classroom metaphor scene, in which E.E. Cummings' poem she being brand new, is used in its entirety. The character Renard (Michael Huguenor), who had a large part in the script but was mostly edited out of the film, makes his only appearance in this scene. Along the way, Nick and Ed narrow the probable motives down to jealousy (Bradwood was trading grades for sex with Dawn-Marie Zeffer (Alexandra Powers), the girlfriend of Kyle Kerns (Peter Dobson), the leader of the bullies) or self-preservation (Bradwood was blackmailing some staff about running a real estate scam on the other teachers). Nick's identity is discovered by Jane Melway (Diane Ladd), one of the con artist's gang, and it all comes to a head at the Pagan May Fest (the school's mascots are the Pagans). Nick and Ed find out that they are probably on the wrong track - Chet Butler (George Wendt), one of the gang's members is missing and an emotional confession from Melway points to Butler as the murderer - not to stop the blackmail, but because Bradwood was engaged to Melway, with whom Butler used to have an affair and whom he still loves. Bradwood also found the love letters in which Butler claims to have killed Melway's husband. Butler appears and implicates himself with words and actions. A chase ensues, ending with Nick being cornered finding the evidence that cements Butler's guilt. Nick is saved twice in quick succession, once by a schoolmate's opportune distraction, and once by an excellent shot of Ed's at the perfect time. Nick makes a date with Robin Torrence, who now knows he is an adult, and the real-estate scammers are arrested. Hector looks very foolish. Matt is released from jail and can't wait to get back to school.

Until 1949, the Umuopara clan used to be part of Ohuhu. before they were carved out politically. Origin There are several beliefs regarding the origin of Ohuhu people. One view is that the Ohuhu people did not migrate from anywhere. This view is supported by the fact that most communities in Ohuhu have their old or abandoned settlements, Okpuala, also located in Ohuhu. While this view sounds plausible, some villages in Ohuhu today can convincingly trace their old settlements to places outside Ohuhu, even though they have another okpuala now located in Ohuhu. Umukabi, Umuawa, Umuagu, Umungasi and Umudiawa are a few examples in this category. It has been suggested that at least sections of the Umuhu people of Ohuhu came from Isuikwuato and Awgu areas. Far more persuasive than the rest is the theory that Ohuhu people migrated from parts of the present Etiti Division. Put so tersely, this theory leaves out a number of variants. For instance, one tradition claims that the movement began from Orsu and touched Okiwudo and Akaokwa all in the Orlu area. It then came to Anara-Osu. The tradition states that there, while the Ohuhu ancestors lingered, Obowo ancestors in the horde continued their movement and settled at their present location before Ohuhu people joined them. Another version maintained that the Ohuhu people, with their Obowo counterparts, migrated from the Nekede area in Owerri. In connection with this theory, some writers believe that traditionally, the ancestors of Ohuhu-Ngwa formed part of a migration from the Agbaja area in Owerri and moved to the Imo River. Whether the migration began in Orlu, Nekede, Agba or Ahiara, all three centers are situated on the same unbroken stretch of land. A recurrent name in these theories is Obowo ‚Äì a clan occupying the area west of the Imo River. This river, lying between the Obowo and Ohuhu clans, is to both an important landmark. Whether the Ohuhu people migrated from Orlu area or Owerri they must, of necessity, have crossed the Obowo territory before arriving at their present settlement. This area could well have been a resting point of a protracted journey to a promised land. Possible kinship between Ohuhu and Obowo is suggested in the fact that many places and village names in either of the clans have their exact counterparts in the other. The two broad divisions of Ikenga and Ihite, for example, exist in both. Umukabi and Umuagu villages are known to have, in recent times, common festivals with their Obowo counterparts to commemorate their kinship. Umuawa people in Ohuhu likewise are said to have migrated from Umuoparaodu and Umudibi in Obowo, where traces of their settlements could still be identified today. What appears to be the strongest argument in favor of Ohuhu-Obowo kinship is their common possession of a peculiar deity ‚Äì Ajana, which stood supreme in both clans and belonged exclusively to both.Hon.Ndudim E.

Plot summary The story is framed as a one-sided conversation between two people, with Charley doing all of the talking. Charley recounts how he had fallen into a similar conversation with another man in a bar years before, and that man had told him to go to Acme Travel Bureau, a small travel agency located on the 200 block of West 42nd Street in New York City, and hint to the proprietor that he would like to \\"escape\\" from Earth and its ever-growing list of problems. Charley seeks out the travel agency and strikes up a conversation with the proprietor, who remains nameless. After taking some time to assess Charley, the proprietor of the travel agency confides that \\"just as a sort of little joke,\\" he had printed up a travel brochure for a supposedly fictional planet named Verna, whose inhabitants had evolved some time prior to humans, but were physically very similar to humans. As opposed to the warlike ways displayed by humankind through the years, the Vernans had advanced to a peaceful society on an idyllic forested planet. When the Vernans discovered Earth, they observed it for an unstated period of time, even going so far as to put one of their people on Abraham Lincoln's cabinet. In 1913, just before World War I erupted, they chose to go from passive observation to active intervention, picking a small number of humans over time to invite to Verna. In discussing the Vernans' motivations, the proprietor reasons to Charley, \\"If you saw a neighbor's house on fire, would you rescue his family if you could? As many as you could, at least?\\" Over time the Vernans opened branches of Acme Travel Bureau in every major city and invited people from all over the earth, including Ambrose Bierce and, speculates Charley, Judge Crater. When Charley asks him, \\"when does it stop being a joke?\\", the proprietor tells him, \\"Now. If you want it to.\\" He gives Charley a bus ticket and asks him for whatever money he has on him ‚Äî \\"two five-dollar bills, a one, and seventeen cents in change\\" ‚Äî as payment, saying that he wouldn't need it on Verna and that it would help to pay the light bills and rent for Acme Travel. When Charley questions the price, the proprietor says that an identical ticket had sold earlier for $3,700 and another for $.06. The proprietor then directs him to Acme Depot, from which a bus will take him to the departure point. He arrives at a small bus station \\"on one of the narrow streets west of Broadway\\" occupied by a few other people. They all board a decrepit bus and drive out to rural Long Island, where they are deposited at a dilapidated barn and told to wait for departure to Verna. As he sits and waits in the dark barn, Charley descends into a rage after he concludes he has been played for a fool. He storms out of the barn, but just as he crosses the threshold, he looks back and briefly glimpses, in a flash of light, the planet Verna through the back window of the barn before the barn door slams shut. By the time he gets the barn door back open, the people he left in the barn are gone, taken to Verna. Returning to the travel agency some time later, Charley is greeted by the proprietor, who hands him his money and says, \\"You left this on the counter last time you were here. I don't know why.\\" The story ends with Charley telling his new acquaintance how to find Acme Travel, what to say, and how to act. He then emphasizes to the other person not to back out at the last minute, since no one gets another chance to emigrate to Verna, no matter which branch of Acme Travel they go to, because, in his words, \\"...I've tried. And tried. And tried.\\" Sources *Stealing Through Time‚ÄîOn the Writings of Jack Finney, by Jack Seabrook.

It was published as a mini-series in 1996 and collected into a hardcover volume in 2004. Publication history Kingdom of the Wicked was originally published as black and white comics in the mid-1990s by Caliber Comics. After Dark Horse Comics published Edginton and D'Israeli's Scarlet Traces in 2002, they released an updated version of Kingdom of the Wicked on December 1, 2004. The new version was collected as a hardcover, colored, included a new eight-page prologue and extra story at the end, and was revised to include references to contemporary children's fantasy, such as J. K. Rowling and Lemony Snicket. Plot Kingdom of the Wicked focuses on Christopher Grahame. As a young child he was bedridden and to amuse himself began writing stories centered around an elaborate fantasy world named Castrovalva. As he grew older, he eventually abandoned Castrovalva and its population of made-up friends. (The new prologue shows how, after Chris left, a monster in the shape of a boy arrived to begin terrorizing the populace) After marrying and having his first child, Chris began to write stories again to amuse his daughter. His wife collected them and, without his knowledge, sent them in to be published. Now, several years later, he is known as the greatest children's writer in the world, besieged by offers of movie rights, sequels, art galleries, and the like. At a press event, Chris begins having a series of blackouts, finding himself back in the world of Castrovalva. However, Castrovalva is now a war-torn landscape, where his childhood friends are fighting a war similar to World War I against a figure known as \\"the Great Dictator\\". The Great Dictator was the monster-child from the prologue, the \\"spitting image\\" of Chris. Chris sees his friend, teddy bear Sergeant Fuzzbox, get killed by going over the top and another friend, tin soldier Captain (now Colonel) Flashheart be murdered by an agent of the Great Dictator. In the real world, Chris' wife and his doctors realize the reason he has been having the blackouts is due to a parasitic twin that failed to develop in pregnancy, and has attached itself to Chris' central nervous system. In Castrovalva, Chris has been manipulated into entering the Land Under the Bed that serves as the Great Dictator's headquarters, where the Great Dictator explains much the same thing. He was only able to look out at the world from Chris' senses, being otherwise incapable of anything. When Chris abandoned Castrovalva, the Dictator moved in, finding it a fully made world that he would actually be able to inhabit and live in. However, after tiring of toying with its imaginary inhabitants, he lured Chris back in through the blackouts in order to kill him and possess his real brain, therefore becoming the \\"real\\" Chris. Chris manages to stop the Dictator's attempts by realizing that Castrovalva is his territory, and that he can make the rules there. At the same time in the real world, Chris undergoes surgery to remove the fetus from his skull. However, Chris takes pity on the Dictator, and absorbs his essence into his. A brief afterword states that Chris took nine months to regain consciousness, and never told anyone of the events. However, the final page shows him working on a script entitled \\"Kingdom of the Wicked\\", implying his next book will be based on what he saw, and the final panel shows Chris and the Dictator, both as small boys again, running through a restored Castrovalva to play with Fuzzbox, Flashheart, and the other friends who died in the war.

MadWorld is divided into several levels representing different parts of Jefferson Island that have been converted into sets for the game show \\"DeathWatch\\". The player progresses through these levels in a linear fashion during the first playthrough, but can revisit any completed level to attempt to score more points or take on a harder challenge. Most levels are open environments, allowing the player to explore them freely, although some sections of the level may require the player to earn a number of points before it will be accessible. A few levels feature motorcycle-based combat where the main character, Jack, is assaulted by foes as they race down a track or in a small arena. The player is challenged to beat the level's boss within a time limit, but in order to activate the boss fight, the player must accumulate enough points by defeating regular foes on the level. There will also be other challenges, bonuses, or mini-bosses that will become active after the player accumulates enough points. A common feature of each of these levels is the \\"Bloodbath Challenge\\", a time-limited minigame that rewards the player for completing a specific type of activity with additional points. For example, the player may need to attempt to swing a bat at foes to knock them into a giant dartboard to score points, or to ensure foes are trapped in front of a speeding train. Outside of these challenges, the player is awarded points for every defeat of a foe. The number of points for beating foes increases by increasing the foe's power or using more unusual methods of winning. For example, while the player could throw an enemy on a wall, the player will earn significantly more points if they had previously forced a tire around the enemy. The player controls Jack from a third-person perspective using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment for attacks and movement, respectively. MadWorld does not make use of the Wii Remote's infrared sensor, as its developers found it unnecessary to pinpoint movements on the screen in order to attack. When certain special attacks are possible, the player is prompted to press a button or move the controllers in a specific fashion to complete the action. In boss fights, the player must trigger special finishing moves that engage their foe in a series of quick time events in order to weaken, dismember attached weapons or defeat the boss, called Power Struggles. These are also possible against certain normal enemies. The game features extreme, over-the-top violence, but designer Shigenori Nishikawa intends it to be seen in a comical light despite the dark tone of the game. For example, in a minigame called \\"Man Darts\\", players must hit enemies onto a giant dart board with a baseball bat to score points. However, because of the intended level of violence PlatinumGames is unsure of whether or not the game will ultimately be released in Japan, stating, \\"In certain markets there are a lot of limitations on the amount of violence you can show, so we definitely have the Western market much more in mind.\\" MadWorld features highly stylized graphics that use a limited color palette of high contrast black and white with red, partially inspired by Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels. Plot Three days before the game's event, the fictional Varrigan City became a target for a group of terrorists called \\"The Organizers\\", who severed the island city's transportation and communication ties with the rest of the world. They released a virus onto its population that would kill them in less than a day. However, the Organizers informed the populace that any person that killed another would receive the vaccine. The city was quickly transformed into the stage of a recurring game show called \\"DeathWatch\\", with announcers Howard \\"Buckshot\\" Holmes (Greg Proops) and former DeathWatch fighter Kreese Kreeley (John DiMaggio). The remaining citizens of Varrigan City and new hopeful ones become the show's contestants, hoping to become the top-ranked fighter in the game and win a large cash prize. Jack Cayman (Steven Blum), a man with the chainsaw attached to his prosthetic arm, enters the games and manages to gain sponsorship from \\"Agent XIII\\" (Jim Ward). The game's organizers, led by Noa (Dwight Schultz), knows Jack's motive is more than just to win, and learn that Jack works with someone on the outside. They come to learn that Jack was a former marine, police officer and rogue agent, but now seems intent on a mission. Noa surmises that Jack is after Naomi Ann Boris (Kate Higgins), the mayor's daughter working in the city. While they plan to kill Jack, they realize he became an audience favorite, with many sponsors and viewers betting on his success. Meanwhile, Jack meets Leo Fallmont (Danny Cooksey), a hospital doctor who was unwittingly trapped in the city, but managed to obtain the vaccine. After telling Leo to stay low, Jack continues the mission. When Jack finds Naomi, he learns that she is the one watching the games and not getting in crisis. Jack leaves and continues to solve the case about the city's abnormal situation. Meanwhile, the Organizers realize Jack as the reigning champ, who quit the games by signing on to the Chasers. As Jack nears the last battle against reigning- feigning champ, the Black Baron (Reno Wilson), Agent XIII reveals himself to be Lord Gesser, an influential figure in politics and knows that the DeathWatch games were created to cause the attack, but admits that this particular incarnation of the games is solely driven by someone's greed, and passes on the name of Springvale to Jack and the Agency, which quickly recognizes the name as a pharmaceutical company and that they were the silent hand that had built (in anticipation of DeathWatch) much of the sets for the games as soon as the Organizers had released the virus. After defeating the Black Baron at the end of the games, Jack blames Noa, who is shot and killed by Leo. After dealing with the armed forces, Jack disables the communication link with the Chasers and interrogates Leo. Leo tells Jack that his father was the president of Springvale Pharmaceuticals, who created both the virus and the vaccine, and were planning to use the televised DeathWatch event to show the effect of the virus as to blackmail anyone to pay for the vaccine under the outbreak. Leo admits that the company went bankrupt on the last presidential election and saw this route as the easiest way to recoup their losses. He is also at the games to be close to the action, fascinated by sports. Jack throws Leo off the tower to his death. While the announcers complain about the irrelevance, Jack leaves Varrigan City. Development MadWorld was created by PlatinumGames, a studio founded by former members of Capcom's Clover Studio, in their attempt to make a game that would be \\"fun and attractive\\" for the Wii, but that would also have a high level of violence that would make it unique for the system. The game was produced by Atsushi Inaba, who had previously produced Viewtiful Joe, and directed by Shigenori Nishikawa, one of the designers of Resident Evil 4. The developers chose violence as the main theme of the title, but experimented with a variety of cartoon-like art styles to alleviate the violent content with a sense of humor, ultimately deciding upon a black-and-white aesthetic with splashes of red for blood. Inaba and Nishikawa acknowledged the influence of Frank Miller's Sin City in the work, but also noted they borrowed from both Western and Japanese comic book styles to create a unique style. Comic-book style text and sound effects are also used in the game. The main character, Jack, was designed to be \\"big and tough\\" rather than traditionally heroic, with an appearance that suggests he \\"has been worn down by the world.\\" MadWorld was developed primarily for a Western audience, and the team extensively analyzed American pop culture in search of material that was so extreme and unrealistic it produced a comedic effect. Inaba played a variety of games, such as Manhunt 2, to see how they portrayed serious violence and to avoid making those same choices with MadWorld. Nishikawa chose to focus entirely on combat, omitting extraneous puzzle-solving or collection elements, with the goal of making the game easy to play in short sessions. The game's motion controls were designed to be as intuitive as possible, with Inaba reflecting that \\"we've come to believe the Wii controller is actually more intuitive and more relevant for action games.\\" An emphasis was placed on earning high scores, while \\"Bloodbath Challenge\\" minigames were used to incorporate additional variety into the game's design. The game was developed using Softimage for creation of the game's art, and a custom engine built to handle the art aesthetic and limitations of the Wii's memory. The game's sets are completely modeled with complex lighting features, but only normal maps are used to draw the game, avoiding the high-processing costs of light maps or layered textures. This also allowed the game's artists to have finer control of visibility and color balance in the game. Though the developers attempted to add reflection mapping into the game, they found it did not fit well with the comic-book style and dropped it. Explosions and other effects, normally created in other games using particle effects to achieve a factor of realism, were also modeled with particles in MadWorld, but using specially-designed images to retain the comic book style. To overcome the lighting issues, the main character of Jack was modeled with two different textures, one used when he was in a bright area, and second used in dark areas that highlighted the main lines of the character's face. Jack and other principal characters from the game were redesigned with the black-and-white features adjusted numerous times to make sure they did not simply blend into the background as the lesser enemies in the game. Other characters were drawn and modeled to be as destructible as possible, with numerous versions of each character having missing limbs or other bodily harm. These were put together in 2000-frame animations that were then motion-captured; movement from one animation to another was blended out with the use of Hermite interpolation. Blood spurts from each of the methods that Jack could use to kill a foe were each uniquely modeled to capture the appropriate trajectory for the type of injury, and often increasing the realistic amount of blood in order to make it stand out in the world. The spatters of blood on the walls, floor, and other characters was also modeled within the game using a collision detection system and a complex system for how the blood would interact with Jack's clothing. Early builds of the game resulted in disorientation and eye strain due to the lack of colors. To avoid this, the developers limited the amount of on-screen movement and adjusted the game's textures to include more gradual changes from black to white. While some of MadWorld relies on the Havok engine for modeling physical interactions in the game, the developers found they had to resort to their own programs to capture some of the reactions and behaviors of the enemies for many of the unique killing methods. Comparisons have also been drawn between the game and Inaba's last project, God Hand, a comedy beat 'em up for the PlayStation 2. However, Inaba claims that while God Hand was developed for \\"hardcore\\" gamers, MadWorld is \\"a lot easier to pick up.\\" The game's use of over-the-top violence was intentional to add humor to it. The game's story was written by Yasumi Matsuno, famous for his design in the Ogre Battle series and a number of Square Enix titles. Matsuno was given two opposing guidelines to writing the scenario. While the development team ruled that violence should acceptable in the game's world, Inaba expressed his desire for violence to be \\"denied in the end\\" due to current views of violence in the video game industry. Matsuno combined the ideas for MadWorld's DeathWatch gameshow environment: violence is both accepted and required within the show, but not outside of it. Proops and DiMaggio, who had previously worked together on animated films such as Asterix and the Vikings and Kaena: The Prophecy, were both contacted by the voice cast director Jack Fletcher to play the parts of the announcers for the North American and European release. While most of their lines were already scripted, the two were able to ad-lib during recording, with some lines being retained in the final game. =Soundtrack= The music for the game was composed by Naoto Tanaka, PlatinumGames' in-house composer, along with four different local artists‚ÄîOx, Doujah Raze, Sick YG, and Bandy Leggz. Tanaka wanted to \\"write in American style music and tried to avoid a true Japanese style\\". At the request of Inaba, the music styles included hip hop and rock, taking inspirations from the mashup album Collision Course from Linkin Park and Jay-Z. Tanaka created the backtracks first using Cubase SX and ACID, then gave these, along with the general theme of the level associated with the music, to the artists for them to add lyrics and other performances. Tanaka received feedback from the American branch of PlatinumGames to refine the music to get the Western style down. Music was then assigned for the various stages and boss battles, requiring some revision of the existing works to make the music more apt for that stage of the game. A total of 50 minutes of music was created for the game, and a soundtrack of the game's music was released along with the game in the United Kingdom and Australia. The soundtrack was released in North America on June 30, 2009 by Sumthing Distribution. Controversy On August 19, 2008, Sega announced that MadWorld would not be released in Germany. Despite the fact that Australia is also known for strict video game classification, the game was released there unedited, with an MA15+ rating for \\"strong bloody violence and strong coarse language\\". In a preview, Eurogamer commented: \\"It's difficult to understand why there's so much controversy surrounding MadWorld when the violence is so very Tom and Jerry... It really is hard to be offended... because it's just so ridiculous.\\" On March 10, the National Institute on Media and the Family issued a press release expressing its disappointment in Nintendo for allowing MadWorld to be released on the Wii. Reception MadWorld has received positive reviews from critics. In its April 2009 issue, Nintendo Power gave MadWorld a 9/10 rating. IGN gave the game a 9/10, praising the style, gameplay, and music, but criticizing the camera and short length, though it mentions that the hard difficulty level lengthens the game and increases the challenge considerably. Pixel Hunt called it \\"one of the few must-have Wii titles\\". StageSelect.com praised the title for its artistic game design, but stated that the overall delivery had trouble living up to the hype. About.com felt the game was more flash than substance, giving it a 3/5 and stating: \\"Divorced of its unique graphics and over-the-top presentation, this is actually a rather mediocre beat-em-up.\\" Game Informer disagreed, praising the deep combat system and arguing: \\"for an amateur to become a talented executioner, you'll have to lash out creatively, prolonging your victim's death through multiple phases of pain. MadWorld runs the gamut in violence, taking an encyclopedic approach to its variety in kills. Some of the bloodletting will make you squirm uncomfortably.\\" IGN opined: \\"MadWorld does not place emphasis on style over gameplay...there's plenty of fun, smart mechanics to back up the overwhelmingly slick look and sound of the title.\\" Legacy Sean Ratcliffe, Vice President of Marketing for Sega of America stated that, in terms of sales, \\"the first set of data for Madworld is very encouraging\\". The game sold around 66,000 copies in its first month of release in North America, according to NPD Group. These sales numbers have been used by market research firm OTX Research to justify their assertion that hype and marketing do not translate into sales figures; MadWorld, while commanding the \\"highest level of unique interest\\" based on user input at IGN, ranks 41st in OTX's sales metric for all Wii titles. Sales of the game have reached 123,000 units in North America as of August 2009. MadWorld fared much poorer in Japan, where it debuted at number 33 on Japanese sales charts and only selling around 3,000 units during its release week. Despite low sales for both MadWorld and The House of the Dead: Overkill, Sega stated that it would continue to explore mature games for the Wii, according to Gary Dunn, a director at Sega Europe, noting that such games have a long tail in sales as such games become more discounted. On January 4, 2010 it was announced that Sega would not publish any future M-rated video games for the Wii, but PlatinumGames announced a few days later that they would like to do a sequel to MadWorld, which ended up as Anarchy Reigns, a 3D fighting game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 that was released in 2012 in Japan and 2013 in western territories. In a 2019 interview, Inaba called MadWorld one of the most enjoyable projects he had worked on. On March 10, 2020, PlatinumGames celebrated MadWorld's 11th anniversary with new artwork of Jack created by lead character designer Masaki Yamanaka.

Savage Sword of Conan starred Robert E. Howard's most famous creation, Conan the Barbarian, and has the distinction of being the longest-surviving title of the short-lived Curtis imprint. As a \\"magazine\\", Savage Sword of Conan did not have to conform to the Comics Code Authority, making it a publication of choice for many illustrators. It soon became one of the most popular comic series of the 1970s and is now considered a cult classic. Roy Thomas was the editor and primary writer for the series' first few years (until issue 60), which featured art by illustrators such as Neal Adams, Dick Giordano, Barry Windsor-Smith, John Buscema, Alfredo Alcala, Jim Starlin, Al Milgrom, Pablo Marcos, and Walter Simonson. Painted covers were provided by such artists as Earl Norem, Bob Larkin, and Joe Jusko. Savage Sword of Conan was published under the Curtis imprint until issue 60, when it became part of the Marvel Magazine Group. Stories from the comic were reprinted in the Marvel UK title of the same name. The original run of Savage Sword of Conan ran until issue #235 (July 1995). Marvel Comics reacquired the publishing rights in 2018, and started a new run of Savage Sword of Conan beginning in February 2019.  Publication history  The adventures in Savage Sword of Conan are not always consecutive (as they are in the color Marvel title Conan the Barbarian), and they cover different eras of Conan's life. The Savage Sword stories mostly feature an older Conan, and adapt Robert E. Howard stories and pastiches starting from \\"Black Colossus\\" (according to the Miller/Clark chronology), thus following the Roy Thomas stories in Conan the Barbarian. The first issue leads off with Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith's adaptation of one of Howard's shortest but most well-known Conan tales, \\"The Frost Giant's Daughter\\". This is one of Conan‚Äôs earliest tales chronologically. Still a teenager, he encounters a beautiful woman in the frozen north who leads him into an ambush by her giant brothers. Issue #2 featured another Howard adaptation, \\"Black Colossus\\", in which Conan faces off against a three-thousand-year-old sorcerer. This story teams long time Conan penciler John Buscema with his frequent partner Alcala. The cover of issue #5 sports a Boris Vallejo painting of Conan being crucified, from the story \\"A Witch Shall Be Born\\". This story features Conan at his most resilient, surviving a desert crucifixion to get revenge on the man who put him there. Issues #6-10 included \\"People of the Dark\\", a 30-page tale scripted by Thomas and drawn by Alex Ni√±o; the continued adaptation of Howard‚Äôs only full-length Conan novel, The Hour of the Dragon (the first parts having been printed in Giant-Size Conan #1-4); and the adaptation of \\"Iron Shadows in the Moon\\", by Buscema and Alcala, where Conan goes from chief of the Zuagirs to pirate captain of the Red Brotherhood. The next three years of the title featured numerous adaptations of Howard stories (many by the art team of Buscema and Alcala), including \\"Shadows in Zamboula\\", \\"The Devil in Iron\\", \\"The People of the Black Circle\\", \\"The Slithering Shadow\\", \\"The Pool of the Black One\\", \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\", \\"Jewels of Gwahlur\\", \\"Beyond the Black River\\", \\"The Scarlet Citadel\\", \\"The Flame Knife\\", \\"Hawks Over Shem\\", \\"The Treasure of Tranicos\\", and \\"Wolves Beyond the Border\\". A later issue (#204) adapts Howard's \\"Drums of Tombalku\\".  Collected editions In 2007, Dark Horse Comics began issuing a series of trade paperbacks, collecting and reprinting early issues of the title, as well as stories which originally appeared in Savage Tales.In 2018 when Marvel resumed the rights it began publishing its own collected editions of original Marvel material. Marvel collected editions : Conan Omnibus Savage Sword volume 1 (Marvel,2018) Conan Omnibus Savage Sword volume 2 (Marvel,2019) Awards The comic won the \\"Comic\\" British Fantasy Award in 1975 and 1976.

Following the 2010 election of the coalition government, funding was cut by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Arts Council England in 2011, with activity in schools ending in summer 2011. Aim It aimed to build sustainable learning partnerships between schools, creative and cultural organisations and individuals. Methods Creative Partnerships facilitated many long-term links between schools and creative professionals, such as artists, architects, scientists and multimedia developers. Research reports covering many different aspects of the programme, conducted by researchers from a number of universities and consultancies, are available online. Reports include literature reviews about creativity and education, teacher identity, pupil wellbeing and tracking progression in creativity; evaluations and surveys of the programme; and qualitative research investigating pedagogy, wellbeing and progression. https://archive.is/20131017205459/http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/tag/research  Who delivered Creative Partnerships?  Between 2002 - 2009, local Arts Council offices delivered the programme in 36 areas of England. Peter Jenkinson OBE was the first national director of the programme and he was succeeded by Paul Collard. Between 2009 - 2011, responsibility for Creative Partnership was transferred to Creativity, Culture and Education. Creativity, Culture and Education, chaired by Paul Roberts with Paul Collard as CEO, funded 25 organisations to deliver Creative Partnerships in their local area. These were a range of independent and ‚Äòhost‚Äô cultural organisations, with many of the individuals working there transferring from Arts Council England. Funding The organisation was managed by Arts Council England and funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with additional funding from the Department for Education. It was finally managed by Creativity, Culture and Education (CCE).

With Richard Wilson he is recognised as a pioneer of English landscape in art, for its own sake. Life and work Lambert was born in Kent and studied art under Warner Hassells and John Wootton, soon attracting attention by the quality of his landscape painting. He painted many large and fine landscapes in the style of Gaspar Poussin and Salvator Rosa. Many of his landscapes were finely engraved by Fran√ßois Vivares, James Mason (1710‚Äì1785), and others, including a set of views of Plymouth and Mount Edgcumbe (painted conjointly with Samuel Scott), a view of Saltwood Castle in Kent, another of Dover, and a landscape presented to the Foundling Hospital in London. Lambert also obtained a great reputation as a scene-painter, working at first for the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, in London, under John Rich. When Rich moved to Covent Garden Theatre, Lambert secured the assistance of Amiconi, and together they produced scenery of far higher quality than any previously executed. Lambert was a man of jovial temperament and shrewd wit, and frequently spent his evenings at work in his painting-loft at Covent Garden Theatre, to which men of note in the fashionable or theatrical world resorted to share his supper of a beef-steak, freshly cooked on the spot. Out of these meetings arose the well-known \\"Beefsteak Club\\" which long maintained a high social reputation. Most of Lambert's scene-paintings unfortunately perished when Covent Garden Theatre was destroyed by fire in 1808. Lambert was a friend of William Hogarth and a member of the jovial society that met at 'Old Slaughter's' Tavern in St Martin's Lane. In 1755 he was one of the committee of artists who proposed a royal academy of arts in London. He was a member of the Society of Artists of Great Britain, exhibited with them in 1761 and the three following years, and during the same period contributed to the Academy exhibitions. In 1765 he and other members seceded and formed the Incorporated Society of Artists of Great Britain, of which he was elected the first president. In conjunction with Samuel Scott, Lambert painted a series of Indian views for the old East India House in Leadenhall Street. He also etched two prints after Salvator Rosa. Lambert was associated in 1735 with George Vertue, Hogarth, and John Pine (engraver, 1660‚Äì1756) in obtaining a bill from parliament securing artists a copyright on their works. Lambert's portraits were painted by Thomas Hudson, John Vanderbank (engraved in mezzotint by John Faber the younger in 1727, and in line by H. Robinson and others), and Hogarth. Lambert's most famous painting is \\"A view of Box Hill, Surrey\\" \\"A view of Box Hill, Surrey\\" at The Tate (1733) which depicts a well-known beauty spot south of London. Hogarth considered Lambert a rival to the famous French landscape painter Claude Lorrain (1600‚Äì1682) with respect to his use of soft light to unify the scene in this painting. Though he never visited Italy he was inspired by the classical tradition of landscape painting. Lambert died on 30 November 1765 at his home on the Piazza in Covent Garden. His pupils included John Inigo Richards (1731‚Äì1810) and John Collett (1725‚Äì1780). Gallery A View of Box Hill, Surrey 1733.jpgA view of Box Hill, Surrey, 1733.

From left to right: Gau Meguro, Raik≈ç Shimizu, Kazuhiko Yukimi, Yoite, Miharu Rokujou, Tobari Kumohira, Raimei Shimizu, and Koichi Aizawa. The Nabari no Ou anime and manga series features an extensive cast of characters created by Yuhki Kamatani. The series takes place in a modern-day Japan where the ninja world of is hidden from the surface world, a name given to the world unaware of Nabari. The series' storyline follows Miharu Rokujou, a 14-year-old student who unknowingly possesses a powerful secret art within him, and his introduction into Nabari upon his power's activation. The protagonist of the series Miharu Rokujou remembers nothing of his childhood and lost his parents at an early age. However, he is not concerned by this and strives to live a normal life. This plan is compromised when Miharu is attacked by real ninja and Koichi Aizawa and Tobari Kumohira come to his aid. There, Miharu learns about the hidden ninja world of Nabari and the Shinra Banshou, a powerful secret art containing all of the world's knowledge, which resides inside of him. This secret art is so powerful, the possessor is revered as the King of Nabari and is sorely coveted after. To protect himself, Miharu is forced to join his school's Nind≈ç club managed by his two protectors. Kumohira vows to find a way to remove the secret art from Miharu. Until then, Kumohira, Aizawa, and Raimei Shimizu, a samurai from their ally the Fuuma Village, must protect Miharu from the Grey Wolves, a squad of elite ninja who lead the search for the secret art, and foil the Grey Wolves' attempts to gather each ninja village's .  Banten Village  During the Sengoku period, Village was a dispatch post of Iga Village. After the creation of the kinjutsush≈ç , it was considered to be an independent village. It was always small and is currently on the verge of extinction. Its members are known as the conservatives of the Shinra Banshou, Nabari's most powerful and coveted secret art. There are three Banten ninja: Miharu Rokujou, Tobari Kumohira, and Koichi Aizawa. Miharu is the possessor of the Shinra Banshou. Aizawa is one of Miharu's classmates. Although he seems to be a normal 14-year-old, he was originally an owl who became immortal after a former possessor of the Shinra Banshou experimented on him. Tobari is Aizawa's and Miharu's teacher in the front world. The village has no leader throughout the duration of the story's events. In the anime adaptation however, Tobari Kumohira is acting as the temporary leader. The Engetsurin's effect and whereabouts of the kinjutsush≈ç are known only to Tobari. Although it has been seen in the manga adaptation in the recent updates, it has only been used once during the anime adaptation. It is located on a silver cuff on Kumohira's ear and has the ability to restore memories. The kinjutsush≈ç is so powerful that it is able to restore memories to people who did not have the memory to begin with. = Miharu Rokujou = is an apathetic 14-year-old middle school student and protagonist of the series. Although Nabari's most powerful secret art, the coveted , is literally written into his body and he is venerated by all of Nabari's ninja as king, Miharu cares little about his gift's profound merits. His only goal is to inherit the family's okonomiyaki store. To protect those around him from getting hurt, he acts indifferently although he is not averse to acting in a rather innocent and cute manner to get what he wants. Miharu actually yearns for love at heart. After Miharu meets Yoite and promises to erase him in exchange for his friends' lives, his indifference begins to sway as his concern starts to revolve around Yoite. As the bond between them tightens, Miharu begins to wish for Yoite's continued existence, and offers to use Shinra Banshou to save him when Yoite collapses in a near death state from overuse of Iga Village's kinjutsush≈ç Kira. However, Yoite dissuades him from doing this and dies before the erasure can transpire. The Shinra Banshou spirit comments that Miharu fulfills a wish of his own although he fails to erase Yoite's existence. After a one-month rest, Miharu wakes up without any memories of Yoite, although he vaguely recalls erasing a person. = Kouichi Aizawa = is Rokujou's seemingly 14-year-old classmate who studies Nind≈ç under Kumohira. He is normally portrayed with an energetic attitude around other people, becoming serious and relentless when it comes to ninja duties. He is fascinated with death as a result of his immortality. His immortality is attributed to the holder of the Shinra Banshou during the Edo period, who was a medical practitioner who experimented with placing the wisdom of the Shinra Banshou into animals, since humans usually died. He and Shijima Kurookano are the only survivors of the experiments and gained immortality; they believe that their mission is to observe the end of Nabari. This implies that Kouichi, and subsequently Shijima, are at least a century old. Kouichi's ultimate goal to have the Shinra Banshou release him from immortality and ensure that another immortal being or \\"monster\\" like himself is never created again. They are together referred to as the The Aizawa household are descended from Fuuma ninjas and are native Banten ninja. Kouichi has also confessed his love to Raimei, though she has not yet given him an answer. = Tobari Durandal Kumohira = is Miharu Rokujou's and Koichi Aizawa's 25-year-old teacher in the front world, the world that is unaware of Nabari. Born in Ireland, he was forced by his grandfather, a \\"Japan otaku\\" and \\"ninja fanatic\\", to go to Japan and learn to become a ninja. Kumohira is unable to return home partly due to an intense hatred of transport resulting from amaxophobia, a fear of being or riding in vehicles. Shortly after his arrival in Japan, he became a close acquaintance to the Rokujou family. He was involved in an incident involving the Shinra Banshou and the deaths of its current user, Asahi Rokujou, her husband, and Tobari's grandfather. The incident was erased from the memories of every one involved individual through the Shinra Banshou's power and Miharu's memories of Tobari's acquaintance with the Rokujou family were lost. Tobari is the only one to remember the incident. In the world of Nabari, he is a ninja of the Banten Village. He is entirely devoted to protecting Rokujou, and wants him to become the king of Nabari. In the anime adaption, he is the temporary leader as the current leader is away while in the manga, he is not a stand-in, but has the power to arrange for a temporary leader. According to Aizawa, Kumohira has probably recorded Banten's kinjutsush≈ç through verbal communication. Among the Banten ninja, Kumohira is the most vehement dissident against Miharu using the Shinra Banshou, instead advocating its permanent seal. This often results in him going to great length to dissuade Miharu from attempting to activate it, which clashes with Miharu's promise to Yoite. After realizing Miharu's determination to fulfill his promise, Kumohira goes into hiding to conceal the whereabouts of the last kinjutsush≈ç, Banten's Engetsurin, from those trying to find it. Following the Shinra Banshou's latest activation, he has returned to Banten.  Fuuma Village  Village is a village allied with Banten found deep within a forest in the Japanese countryside. Nearly all the texts regarding ninjutsu and the Shinra Banshou has been written the village's leader Kotarou Fuuma. The Shimizu clan, which resides in Fuuma, are guardians of the world of Nabari and the Shinra Banshou and are to always act neutrally. Fuuma's kinjutsush≈ç is the . The Tenpenka reshapes the cells of the user into any desired shape. However, because the cells are being reshaped, they will eventually misalign, collapse, and die. = Raimei Shimizu = is a 14-year-old guardian of the world of Nabari and head of Fuuma Village's Shimizu clan. She prefers to fight with a sword named over using ninjutsu to the point of claiming to be a samurai. Five years ago, her older brother Raik≈ç annihilated their clan. She has sworn to kill him in revenge. The two reconcile and stay on friendly terms after Raimei learns that the massacre was Raik≈ç's vengeance against their uncle and his gang, who killed Raik≈ç and Raimei's parents. She has a tendency to mistake one person for another or reveal information she intended to keep to herself when excited. = Kotarou Fuuma = is the leader of Fuuma Village and a chief consultant of MEXT. He has written almost all the texts regarding ninjutsu and the Shinra Banshou and all about the world of Nabari and ninja techniques, with the exception of the kinjutsu of other villages. He loves women as he claims that if he had the power of the Shinra Banshou, he would turn the Fuuma Village into a paradise where all the world's women are in love with him. Most of Fuuma's residents are female. According to Raimei, he is lying ninety percent of the time. He has spies hidden within the other ninja villages. = Saraba = is Kotarou's second-in-command. She is a no-nonsense woman and acts much like an older sister to Raimei and J≈´ji, calling Raimei once Raik≈ç has been spotted. Assists in locating him. = J≈´ji Minami = is a 12-year-old medical ninja who has accompanied Miharu on several missions. It is implied that she may have a crush on Miharu.  Kairoushuu/Iga  The are a squad of elite ninja independent from the Village led by T≈çj≈´r≈ç Hattori. The Iga Village is said to be connected to the birth of the Shinra Banshou and the Grey Wolves are the main force seeking it. As such, the Grey Wolves are the main antagonists. They aim to remove the Shinra Banshou from Miharu Rokujou and are stealing the kinjutsush≈ç from other villages. The group is split into specialized sub-divisions. The , shortened Suik≈ç-Han, handles all operations in the field and is responsible for the acquisition of the kinjutsush≈ç from other villages. The researches the Shinra Banshou and through studying the kinjutsush≈ç, investigates ways to extract and control the secret art. The , also known as the , are responsible for managing the rebels within the organization often through elimination. The Grey Wolves' secret intelligence unit is part of the Ministry on Defense. In the anime adaption, the secret intelligence unit is called . The Grey Wolves' leader T≈çj≈´r≈ç Hattori often takes in outcasts, as seen when he takes in Kazuhiko and Kazuho Yukimi, Raik≈ç Shimizu, and Yoite, offering them a place within the organization. Iga Village is very modernized, using the internet to keep the villagers in touch with each other. is the village's kinjutsush≈ç. = Tojuro Hattori = is the 59-year-old leader of the Iga clan and the Grey Wolves. He serves as a political critic in the front world. His ideal is to change history and achieve equality among humans with the Shinra Banshou, fascinating and winning the loyalty of many subordinates, as seen with Yukimi and Raik≈ç. Hattori takes in many outcasts, such as Yukimi, Kazuho, Raik≈ç, and later Yoite, offering them a place in the Grey Wolves. Despite this kindness, Hattori has little qualms about eliminating whoever opposes him, seen when he orders the Kasa to dispose of Yoite when he defies Hattori. After the Shinra Banshou's latest activation, he temporarily retires from Nabari and entrusts the Grey Wolves and Kasa to an unknown person. = Ichiki = is often seen in the company of Hattori. She is the 49-year-old leader of Kasa. In the front world, she acts as the manager for Hattori's political career. Ichiki is always seen dressed in a traditional kimono and appears to be blind. = Yoite = is a 16-year- old ninja. He uses the Iga's kinjutsush≈ç \\"Kira\\". This technique shoots the user's ki into the target's body and controls it from the inside out, causing the target's bones to break or their body to completely explode. The cost of using this technique is the loss of the user's life force, gradually losing their five senses and eventually dying. When Yoite is introduced, he has only a few more months to live. Yoite first meets Miharu when retrieving Fuuma's kinjutsush≈ç. The two slowly form a bond after Miharu promises to use the Shinra Banshou to fulfill Yoite's wish: to be erased from existence. In turn, Yoite will make Miharu the ruler of Nabari. As their bond deepens, he becomes more protective of Miharu and begins to show rebellious signs toward Grey Wolf leader, Hattori, when Miharu in harm's way by his orders. Yoite becomes openly rebellious when Hattori attempts to persuade Miharu to not grant Yoite's wish, causing Hattori to send Kasa assassins after Yoite and Miharu. When Miharu is captured by the assassins, Yoite, Koichi, and Shijima rescue him. However, the lethal side effects of Kira take their toll on Yoite. In the manga, he thanks Miharu for staying with him and asks Miharu to be happy. He asks Miharu to erase him, but perishes before the Shinra Banshou can be used. The Shinra Banshou notes that, though Miharu's wish came too late, his desire still came true. Though it is unknown exactly what Miharu's wish was, no one can remember Yoite. Therefore, it seems clear he was erased, to some extent (especially since the scar he gave Miharu is gone). However, since the characters themselves or the events they are faced with do not seem altered, it is unclear how well he was erased. Yukimi and Miharu also recall that someone close to them is gone, and express extreme loneliness over it - though they cannot remember who it was that was erased. Yoite had a hard life, which is the reason he so desperately wanted to be erased from the world. In the anime, he decides that he does want to die instead of disappearing. He spends the rest of his days with Miharu and the others. Miharu is out of the room getting him lemon cider when Yoite actually dies but returns to the room at the last moment to see him ( who has turned into dust) blow away in the wind. Yoite was born intersex, named , although Yoite never considered it to be his name. His mother died in childbirth. His father considered him a death god for that reason. He was confined to the basement and his half-brother was forbidden to approach him. When Yoite turned fourteen, his family decided to kill him, slashing his throat and unsuccessfully attempting to force Tsukasa to do the same. (in the anime) he is then pushed off of a balcony by his parents while they say \\"Why didn't you die.\\" and \\" Only if you would have died.\\" He is then lying on the street when Hattori drives up and takes him in. After this attempt on his life, being erased from existence became his goal. He ran from the house and was saved by Hattori, who accepted him into the Grey Wolves. Yoite spends a year studying the Kira technique and all required ninja skills. Hattori promises this would bring him closer to his goal of being erased. Yoite is placed under Yukimi's care and is given the name Yoite. Shortly before Yoite dies, he realizes that he was alive all along, because he had Miharu and Yukimi there for him. He expresses his happiness that he was not alone in this world, and tells Miharu that he is fully satisfied simply being the \\"Yoite\\" that Miharu and Yukimi know. He then again asks Miharu to erase him - not for his sake, but so that Miharu won't succumb to sadness over Yoite's death, and can continue smiling. After mentioning his desire to return to Yukimi's home (remniscient of the time he left Yukimi's home, stating only \\"bye\\", causing Yukimi to ask, \\"isn't it 'see you later'?\\" - Yoite now, finally, truly sees Yukimi's home as his home) and for Miharu to make some more okonimiyaki, Yoite dies, happy and satisfied. (Miharu erases memories of Yoite, but he later reveals that he thinks Yoite may not be entirely dead, but \\"scattered\\" instead.) In the anime, Yoite lives out the remainder of his life with Thobari, Hanabusa, and Gau. When he dies, his body evaporates into sparkling lights. = Kazuhiko Yukimi = is a 27-year-old ninja. He acts as a squad leader on field missions and is a freelance writer in the front world. he appears to be very efficient at hand-to-hand combat, but unlike other Shinobi, he also uses a gun. He justifies this unusual weapon choice by claiming that this is the modern age, or \\"age of the individual.\\" He lives with Yoite and is protective of him and cares for Yoite as his health degenerates. Although he claims he hates kids and calls them \\"brats\\", he shows overwhelming concern for Yoite and Miharu. Yukimi documents any impressions Yoite makes on him and any details he learns about Yoite. He learns Yoite's past from Yoite's half-brother Tsukasa. He wishes to learn as much as possible about Yoite so he can tell Yoite that he was truly alive when Yoite is on his deathbed. When he learns of Yoite's defection from the Grey Wolves and the subsequent escape with Miharu, Yukimi goes out of his way to battle Raik≈ç, who initial advises him against protecting Yoite and betraying the Grey Wolves. However, Raik≈ç reveals Yoite destination. Yukimi joins Yoite, Koichi, and Shijima in rescuing Miharu. While fending off two Kasa assassins, he loses his right arm. One month later, he recovers in a Banten hospital and has severed his ties with the Grey Wolves to protect Miharu. He is asked by Tobari to stay at Miharu's side because they share pain of losing Yoite. = Kazuho Amatatsu = , n√©e Yukimi, is a 26-year-old member of the Grey Wolves' Hijutsu Kenky≈´- han and Kazuhiko Yukimi's younger sister. She has a medical license and acts as Yoite's personal physician. Despite her license, her Surface World job is working in a sushi restaurant. In the anime adaption, this restaurant is owned by her husband. She defected from the Grey Wolves because the organization attempted to kill Yukimi. She is using her knowledge of the secret art to aid Banten in its extraction. = Raik≈ç Shimizu = is a 20-year-old samurai of the Shimizu clan. He fights with a sword named , the partner to his sister Raimei's sword. When he was fifteen, his clan dissolved into anarchy and slaughtered each other, with the exception of his sister Raimei, who was led to believe Raikou had killed their entire family. This action is vengeance against his uncle and his gang, who murdered his parents in a coup d'√©tat to take over the clan. After this, he joins the Grey Wolves. He chooses not to tell Raimei his motives behind the massacre to protect her innocence. This leads to a battle between the two. During this battle, his partner Gau is injured trying to stop them and goes comatose. Although K≈çga Village's kinjutsush≈ç could have waken Gau up, Raik≈ç refuses to sacrifice the humans needed to use the kinjutsush≈ç, fearing that Gau would never forgive him for it. Yoite finally wakes Gau up. Because of this, Raik≈ç feels indebted to Yoite and even disobeys Hattori to allow Yukimi to help Yoite. Eventually, Raik≈ç forfeits his loyalty to the Grey Wolves, particularly Hattori, and is denounced as an expendable pawn who is easily replaced. He helps rescue Miharu from the Grey Wolves. He is shown to be living with Gau at the series end. Raik≈ç is portrayed as rather an easygoing if aloof person who takes his responsibilities very seriously. He is shown to be extremely composed and is rarely ruffled or outwardly angered, although he will fiercely protect Gau from harm and his past history with his family remains a sore-point. It is implied that he is a sadist. His Surface World job is a maker of calligraphy paper, a job that his co-workers say he is exceptionally skilled in. At the end of the anime he is killed by Hattori. = Gau Meguro = Three years after his mother had been killed, 17-year-old was saved by Raik≈ç and is thus extremely devoted to him, as well as heavily implied to be romantically enamored with him. He assists Raik≈ç with his responsibilities to the Grey Wolves, usually compiling reports and taking samples from their targets. He is easily incited and received the nickname , from the slang . He believes Wakachi exists to protect the front world from the evils of Nabari. He is an idealist, who believes that the Shinra Banshou can be used to save the world. He knows Raik≈ç's true motives behind the massacre of the Shimizu clan and is the one who reveals the truth to Raimei. When the pair fight against one another, Gau attempts to stop them and becomes comatose. Raik≈ç refuses to sacrifice humans necessary to use K≈çga Village's kinjutsush≈ç to wake him up; it is Yoite who wakes Gau. Gau feels deeply indebted to Yoite and chooses to support him and even goes against the Grey Wolves to aid Yoite. At the end of the anime he is shown to be living Thobari, Hanabusa, and Yoite. His a fan of classical music and hates mess, dirt and clutter. His Surface World job was a brief stint in a country farm store when he was forced to leave school after fleeing the Grey Wolves with Raik≈ç.  Other characters = Shinra Banshou = The is personified as an enigmatic white-haired girl with long nails. Miharu commonly refers to her as . As the true form of the Shinra Banshou, she exists within Miharu, and constantly attempts to entice him into drawing from her powers, believing it is inevitable. In the anime adaption, she tells Oda that she does not want to grant Miharu's wish to Yoite because it is a boring wish and it is not Miharu's own wish. Although she is an intangible persona that resides within Miharu, she has appeared to Tobari once to taunt him. = Yae Oda = is the leader of Village and president of Fog Blue, a small-scale dispatch company and the form the village takes in the front world. She can use Togakushi's kinjutsush≈ç , which gives the user the ability to see into the hearts of others, but lose the ability to use ninjutsu. She agrees to give the scroll containing the kinjutsush≈ç on the condition the assassinate a Professor Flosetti for her. She wishes for Flosetti's death due to past events regarding her child, Alisa. Oda and her daughter were in a car accident and Alisa needed a blood transfusion. One of Flosetti's business partners was at the scene and matched Alisa's blood type, but refused to donate because he would lose his chance to make a name for himself. In the anime adaption, the same business partner was conducting human experiments with particular drugs and tricked Oda, who was blinded by the desire to save her daughter, into giving the drug to her daughter. Oda blames this man for Alisa's death and attempts to kill Flosetti to ruin the man's future. Miharu convinces Oda to never use the Izuna Shingan after witnessing the profound effect her words have on the mentally unstable Yoite. In the anime adaption, her role is extended. After Miharu and Yoite learn that Yoite has only one month to live, the pair visit Oda in her home and ask her to ask the Shinra Banshou if they can use its power without Banten's Engetsurin scroll. At the same time the secret intelligence branch of the Grey Wolves the Tattegami destroy the Fog Blue office building. Afterwards, the Tattegami kidnap Oda, Yoite, and Miharu. The Grey Wolves use ninjutsu and medication to gain her cooperation, but she continually asks about Togakushi's annihilation and refuses to answer the Grey Wolves' questions to the point Hattori needs to personally confront her. She is rescued by Fuuma Village and Kat≈ç. = S≈çr≈ç Kat≈ç = is subordinate of Oda, who turns out to be a spy for Kotarou Fuuma. He is later seen working in a front world library that contains documents on the world of Nabari. He admittedly loves Oda, but is not allowed to return to Togakushi Village or the company because he betrayed her. Despite this, he expresses desires to return there. His specialty is judging what in people's thought, also good at mind manipulation, and anti-mind reading which he used as a spy to avoid being found out by Oda. In the anime adaption, he infiltrates a Grey Wolf hotel to save Oda. = Hanabusa Seki = is Tobari's live-in lover and is older than him by a few years. She is a paleontologist and is often away on work-related business. She knows that Tobari is a ninja, but she does not understand any of the details about Nabari because he has not told her. She has saved Yoite's life in the past and acts like a surrogate mother to both Yoite and Miharu. She is one to take action and will meddle in other people's affairs when they are too shy or afraid to take any action on their own. She often says what comes to her mind without any prior explanation. = Shijima Kurookano = , like Aizawa, has survived experiments performed by the holder of Shinra Banshou, a medical practitioner, during the Edo period. The holder used the Shinra Banshou to give a human heart to a cat, who became Shijima. Because of these experiments, it is implied she is at least a century and a half old. She involves herself in various situations only to observe humans. For observation purposes, she became a ninja of Village and a student of Alya Academy, the school K≈çga Village takes the form of in the front world. When the Alya students attack the Grey Wolves and the Banten ninja, she goes after Miharu and Yoite and reveals herself as inhuman. When the leader of K≈çga Village dies, she receives the scroll containing K≈çga's kinjutsush≈ç and, in turn, she gives it to Miharu. When not in human form, Shijima is disguised as Miharu's cat, , and has been since before Miharu's birth. She is similar in appearance to the spirit of the Shinra Banshou. = Tsukasa K≈çd≈ç = is Yoite's younger half-brother. Although he was generally forbidden to approach Sora as a child, he still made contact on occasion, going to speak through the window of the basement to Sora, and at one point, leading him outside to play a game of catch. Their father threatened Tsukasa with a similar fate to Sora's, should they interact again, saying, \\"That's a ghost. If you interact with it again, I'll make sure you never existed, too!\\" Tsukasa was present during the attempt on Sora's life; he was told to participate as well, but refused. This allowed Sora's escape, and accounts for the fact that he lived through it. Tsukasa harbors a great amount of guilt for his inability to further help his half- sibling. After entering high school, the disagreement he held with his family was too much, and he moved away, on his own, to the town in which Sora's attempted murder had taken place. Later, he meets Kazuhiko Yukimi, and Yukimi becomes aware of the fact that Tsukasa is Yoite's brother. However, instead of relaying this to Tsukasa, Yukimi simply says that Sora is dead. After Yoite's erasure, Tsukasa keeps in contact with Yukimi (and then Miharu), sometimes visiting with Yukimi's cat, also christened Yoite.  Reception  The Nabari no Ou characters have received praise from reviewers of Anime News Network. Carlo Santos commented that the \\"teenage hero discovers amazing hidden powers\\" was done before. However, he believed the character designs are interesting, \\"spiky and stylish\\" and are almost as stylish as the characters of Tite Kubo's Bleach manga. He commented that the character Miharu is a perfect foil for Raimei and in the wrong hands, the characters' traits \\"would end up as tiresome gags\\". Casey Brienza was impressed with how faithfully Kamatani's \\"eccentric style\\" was animated. She said that the emaciated and bony male characters look \\"just as out of proportion on the screen as they do on the page\\", citing the designs as an example of \\"anorexic chic.\\" She comments that all of the characters have some \\"bizarre quirk\\". Carl Kimlinger said that the series' premise sounds a little boring and the characters being ninja makes little difference. However, the distinctive character designs and the \\"properly over-the-top personalities\\" do make a difference. He comments that Miharu is rather \\"girly-looking\\", but the characters in general are good- looking. Ben Leary of Mania.com that he was ambivalent about Miharu's indifference and said it was conceptually an \\"interesting move\\", but he is not sure if it is working as intended. Erin Finnegan of PopCultureShock said Miharu is cute enough, even for d≈çjinshi.

In 1912, Benson donated $10,000 for the purchase and installation of 20 fountains; the designer was Portland architect A. E. Doyle. Two reasons have been suggested for his decision to donate the fountains; one was his hope that they would reduce the consumption of alcoholic beverages during lunch breaks, and the other was that he felt the need after witnessing a girl crying at an Independence Day parade due to her inability to find a drink of water. In the 1970s, the Benson family requested that the bubblers only be installed within specific boundaries of Downtown Portland \\"so as not to diminish the uniqueness of them\\". Also commonly known simply as \\"Benson fountains\\", additional bubblers replicating the original style have been cast and installed over the years.

Two bubblers exist outside of Downtown Portland. In 1965, the City of Portland gifted one to its sister city Sapporo, Japan. The other was installed at the Maryhill Museum of Art near Maryhill, Washington, by special request from Sam Hill, a friend to Simon Benson. Portland also features 74 single-bowl variations. Combined, the fountains normally pour out close to 100,000 gallons of drinking water per day every day of the year, except during extremely cold weather. However, on occasion, during periods of prolonged summer drought, the Water Bureau has turned them off for a period of time, both to conserve water and to encourage citizens to conserve during such times.Lane, Dee (October 28, 1987). \\"'Conserve water,' Portlanders told; To ward off a crisis, the city turns off its fountains and urges residents to let lawns and gardens go dry and cars go unwashed\\".

UTA had announced that FrontRunner service to and from the Pleasant View station was to be suspended indefinitely with the Schedule valid from August 12, 2018. As Mount Pleasant Trains only operated Monday to Friday the last train operated August 10th 2018 http://www.rideuta.com/-/media/Files/Rider-Tools/Route- Schedules/2018/April/750schedule_Apr2018x.ashx This is because of the cost of implementing federally mandated positive train control for the section of track north of Ogden, which UTA shares with the Union Pacific Railroad. Description The station is located at 2700 North US Highway 89 (US-89) and can be easily accessed from either 2700 North or US-89. There are about 300 parking spaces in its free Park and Ride lot. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. Prior to truncation, the FrontRunner provided limited service to and from Pleasant View Station. While nearly all trains originated or terminated in Ogden each weekday there was service to Pleasant View with two trains picking up passengers in the morning and two more dropping off and picking up passengers in the evening for the commute. To supplement this service there is also a UTA bus route that provides more frequent service to Ogden Intermodal Transit Center. The UTA bus connection runs hourly for the morning and evening commute, with no mid-day service. One major reason for limited operation at this station is that the FrontRunner trains must share trackage with Union Pacific Railroad freights. Between Ogden and Provo, the FrontRunner has its own dedicated trackage separate from (but parallel to) the Union Pacific tracks. UTA originally planned to open the station along with the rest of the original start of the FrontRunner service in April 2008, but necessary improvements to the shared stretch of track owned by Union Pacific were delayed when railroad workers were diverted to repair tracks damaged by a landslide near Oakridge, Oregon. The station finally opened for service on September 29, 2008. Originally, only two trains serviced each weekday for the morning and evening commutes. However, service was eventually increased to six trains daily before was the FrontRunner service was temporarily discontinued on September 6, 2011. Limited service was restored on December 10, 2012 and cancelled in 2018. =Future extension= Service on the FrontRunner is planned to extend further north to Brigham City, possibly returning service to this station.

He has also officially advertised other products that he does not own, such as Quicky Grass. Early life Offer Shlomi was born in Beersheva, Israel and grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York. As a child, he was fascinated by Crazy Eddie commercials. He dropped out of high school when he was 17 and moved to Los Angeles, changing his name to Vince Offer.https://www.nbcnews.com/businessmain/shamwow-guy-cleans-his- act-8C11094914 Career =Film= In 1999, Offer directed and appeared in The Underground Comedy Movie, which was met with extremely negative reviews. DVDs of the film were marketed via television infomercial. The film also led to several lawsuits. Although the film was released and screened in 1999, Offer was bankrupt by 2002 and home video distribution plans were shelved. Offer, who had previously been a successful vegetable chopper salesman and businessman, resumed selling vegetable choppers at swap meets to support himself and raise money to complete his film project. Within a few months, he had earned enough to resume production, and the movie was finally completed, released, and marketed entirely on late-night infomercials that Offer paid for with his earnings from the swap meet vegetable chopper sales. The film has sold in excess of 100,000 copies and Offer has used the proceeds from sales to file a lawsuit against the Church of Scientology. He is an ex- Scientologist.\\"Filmmaker Sues Church of Scientology\\" In 2011, he appeared as himself in the Adam Sandler film Jack and Jill. Title character Jill, played by Sandler, referred to him as \\"the ShamWow guy\\". In 2013, Offer released the universally panned InAPPropriate Comedy, which he directed, wrote and appears in as a character called 'Peeping Tom'. The film was originally envisioned as a sequel to his previous anthology, called Underground Comedy 2010. The film features stars Rob Schneider, Michelle Rodriguez, Adrien Brody, and Lindsay Lohan. Examples of film sketches include comedian Ari Shaffir as 'The Amazing Racist', with deliberately offensive hidden-camera encounters with members of different minority groups, and Brody as 'Flirty Harry', a Dirty Harry spoof.Someone Thought It Was a Good Idea to Spend Money On This, Rope of Silicon =Infomercial marketing= Background Offer funded The Underground Comedy Movie with his own money, but had difficulty selling it. He put the trailer in an infomercial, and claims to have sold 50,000 copies via direct order and 50,000 more in stores. In 2010, he advertised Eminem's Recovery album. ShamWow In 2006, Offer began to market a cleaning product that he saw in flea markets, an absorbent towel that he called the \\"ShamWow!\\" The title of the product derives from the French pronunciation of the chamois, often shortened to \\"shammy\\" in English. Offer visited the factory in Germany where the product is made, and he decided to incorporate that fact into the TV pitch. The advertisement, filmed in the summer of 2007 with a budget of $20,000, received critical praise. Slate.com's Seth Stevenson praised Offer for his \\"impressive and subtle mastery of the pitchman's art\\" (with lines such as \\"you know the Germans always make good stuff\\"), and wondered if Offer's \\"abrasive manner might also mark a unique, new strategy in the annals of pitchdom.\\" Stevenson compared Offer to earlier, \\"more upbeat\\" television pitchmen like Billy Mays and the Home Shopping Network hosts and concluded that Offer's \\"smooth-talking condescension\\" was more suited to the present \\"zeitgeist\\" than the \\"earnest fervor\\" of spokesmen like Mays and Ron Popeil. Consumer Reports reported that the infomercial for \\"ShamWow!\\" initially featured Offer claiming that the product held \\"20 times its weight in liquid\\". Later, the infomercial was changed to Offer claiming the \\"ShamWow!\\" held \\"12 times its weight in liquid\\", then again to \\"10 times\\". Consumer Reports did its own test on the product and found that it does indeed hold 10 times its weight in liquid but no more. Offer says that he has sold millions of the towels. In contrast to claims that the absorbency of the towels is over-hyped, he responds that returns are low. Pitchman Billy Mays had been promoting a similar product called Zorbeez two years prior to Offer's \\"ShamWow!\\" product. Mays noted that the \\"ShamWow!\\" commercials use many of the same product demonstrations as the earlier-produced Zorbeez commercial. In February 2009 while on the Adam Carolla radio show, Billy Mays publicly challenged Offer to a \\"pitch off\\" between their respective absorbent towel products. Popular Mechanics tested the absorbency of the two towel products and declared \\"ShamWow!\\" was the more effective of the two, but noted \\"If you have reusable cloth rags (and a roll of paper towels for backup), then neither product is necessary.\\" During the episode, it was suggested that the Popular Mechanics tester did not use the Zorbeez correctly.Pitchmen, episode: \\"Revenge of the Pitchmen\\" (July 1, 2009). Following the popularity of the commercial, TMZ in 2009 posted a remix of the commercial on their site. The remix was originally created by DJ Steve Porter and uploaded on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV6puTS14Ho In 2020, Offer started to sell \\"ShamWow!\\" masks due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.https://www.shamwowmask.com/ Vince pitching the Slap Chop in August 2008 Slap Chop In December 2008, Offer, who had previously sold kitchen utensils at swap meets, appeared in another kitchen-gadget infomercial, advertising the Slap Chop and the Graty. The Slap Chop is a hand- held chopping device with internal blades; to operate it, the user places it over a food item and slaps down the button on the top. The Graty is a cheese grater operated by placing the cheese inside and then turning the outside housing of the utensil which causes the cheese to be grated. Both of these devices are offered in several colors. Offer's aggressiveness and use of double entendres like \\"you're gonna love my nuts\\" have been noted by AdWeek, and, according to an Adweek blog, helped make Offer \\"the man who could beat Billy Mays at his own game.\\" Billy Mays had been promoting a similar product set which included the Quick Chop utensil and the Quick Grater utensil prior to Offer's Slap Chop/Graty product set. Mays again noted that the Slap Chop commercials use many of the same demos as the earlier-produced Quick Chop commercial. Mays said in the same Adam Carolla radio show interview in February 2009 that Offer stole not only the Zorbeez product idea, but also the Quick Chop idea.The Daily Tube: Billy Mays 'ShamPows' ShamWow Guy In April 2009, DJ Steve Porter posted an electro-themed \\"Slap Chop Rap\\" Auto Tune remix which grew a cult following during July 2009. An excerpt from a televised Slap Chop commercial featuring Offer is briefly on screen during the 2013 blockbuster Marvel superhero movie Iron Man 3. In April 2019, DJ Steve Porter posted a 10-year anniversary video of the original electro-themed \\"Slap Chop Rap\\" Auto Tune remix. Schticky In 2012 Offer returned to television selling the \\"Schticky\\", a reusable lint roller that comes in three sizes: little Schticky, Schticky, and big Schticky. The commercial makes many references to his other two commercials for the ShamWow and the Slap Chop, with Offer saying many of his catchphrases. He also pokes fun at his 2009 arrest by posing for a fake mugshot.Official Schticky website The Schticky commercial was co-written by the comedian Dante. Canada Green In April 2014, Offer appeared in a \\"Canada Green\\" commercial advertising their \\"Quicky Grass\\" product. Legal issues =Lawsuits= The Underground Comedy Movie was the subject of a lawsuit filed on September 23, 1998 by Offer against 20th Century Fox and Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the co-directors of There's Something About Mary. Offer claimed that 14 scenes in Mary were lifted from his film. The case was dismissed in 2000, with the judge ordering Offer to pay over $66,000 in attorneys' fees.Offer v. Farrelly, Case No. CV 98-7697 RAP(RCx) (C.D. Cal. January 13, 2000); id. (March 14, 2000). In 2004, Offer sent out a press release through prnewsonline.com announcing his intention to sue the Church of Scientology. In 1997, while production on The Underground Comedy Movie was in progress, the Church of Scientology had allegedly begun a large-scale smear campaign against Offer and his film. (Offer was a Scientologist at the time.)The director claimed the Scientologists' \\"Celebrity Center\\" in Hollywood threatened his Scientology friends in the movie business if they did not write malicious reports against Offer. =Arrest= On February 7, 2009, Offer and a 26-year-old escort were arrested in Miami Beach, Florida after a physical altercation. The police report stated that the escort had bitten onto Offer's tongue and refused to let go, at which point Offer began beating her on the head and left her with lacerations and fractures. Police later released photos of the bloodied Offer, hotel room, and the battered prostitute. Prosecutors later declined to file formal charges against either person. When Offer later spoke of the arrest he stated, \\"It probably saved my life.\\" Personal life Vince Offer married Melody Claire Mandate on April 18, 2014. Mandate filed for divorce on October 18, 2018.

The board discusses what to do with a surplus of money. One proposal is to create a building on a nearby meadow to be able to let in more students. Undergraduate Hugh Balliston is drawn into revolutionary activities by Fellow Tony Beck and the unknown revolutionary Mayerston, much to the dismay of his girlfriend Hetta Frith. Tom Llewyllyn, a fellow of the college since 1963, has become impotent and has an unhappy marriage with Patricia. Daniel Mond, the mathematician who was the protagonist of The Sabre Squadron (15 years earlier) is a (literally) quiet man who can only speak in whispers because of a self- inflicted injury to his throat, but who is still teaching mathematics. Among other teachers is the odd Lord Beyfus and his friend, the somewhat radical Mona Corrington. Through Hugh, Mayerston is trying to start violent protests on the campus but most of them end up as fiascos since the Provost of the College, Robert Constable, treats them with a mixture of contempt and tolerance. Isobel advises Patricia to take a lover and she ends up in bed with Hugh who she, in a farcical scene, must shut in the wardrobe when her daughter unexpectedly comes home. Llewyllyn and Mond invite old friend Fielding Gray to the college but he is rather soon picked up by his over-protective mistress Harriet Ongley. Hetta, who has left Hugh, cries on the shoulder of lord Beyfus, who very much likes to comb her hair. The atmosphere in the school turns to the worse and Mayerston uses more violent methods. During a ceremony in the Chapel (with several of the known characters attending) he and his followers burst into the building and try to destroy the altar and the statue of Henry VI. Tom Llewyllyn saves the statue by use of force and Hetta, fed up with the revolution, protects the altar with assistance from Lord Canteloupe and some other people. During the tumult she is, however, killed by a blow to the head. This tragedy kills also the revolutionary atmosphere of the college. Tony Beck and Mayerston disappear. Constable makes note of how the conservative side have gained a \\"martyr\\" in Hetta and find this of some use to keep things calm. Lord Canteloupe comforts the sad Lord Beyfus by giving him the address of the whore Maisie. Patricia comforts Hugh, forgiven for his revolutionary mistakes, in bed.

Gameplay =Phase one= The game is played by a team of two (friends, relatives, etc.). To start, each team is given three games to play, labelled A, B or C. To help them, one celebrity \\"expert\\" and their specialist subject from each game is displayed. The players must choose one of the games and, once they have, the other four celebrities and their specialist subjects in the chosen game are revealed. Each game contains 15 questions with each question being specific to one of the celebrity's specialist subject. =Questions and answers= The first question comes up with four possible answers; these answers are shown to all but the specialist celebrity. After the correct answer is displayed (it does not matter if the players got it right or wrong), the players then decide on which celebrity was \\"stumped\\" (got the question incorrect; there were at least four occasions of the specialist celebrity being stumped). Once the players have chosen, their chosen celebrity gets \\"locked in\\". After that stage, the celebrities who got the question correct and those were stumped are identified. Following, the players' chosen celebrities are identified; if the celebrity chosen was one of the non-specialist celebrities and were stumped, the players‚Äô jackpot increases to ¬£1,000. If they were the specialist celebrity and were stumped, the players progress up a level with a potential for winning higher amounts of money and the studio changes colour (level 1 is purple, level 2 is yellow, level 3 is blue, level 4 is green and level 5 is left unknown because no couple has reached that point in the game). The players who chosen the stumped specialist celebrity then play for ¬£5,000. Subsequent correct guesses by the players will increase to ¬£10,000, then ¬£15,000, then to the maximum ¬£25,000. =Back to zero= If the players make an incorrect guess (meaning that their chosen celebrity, specialist or non- specialist, got the question right), they lose what they have accumulated so far. They will still be allowed to continue playing at their current prize level, restarting their jackpot from zero. However, if they make an incorrect guess twice in a row, they'll go down a level (unless they are still on the first level). =Passing= If at any point the players are uncertain of correctly guessing a stumped celebrity, they can pass on the question they are on and keep their winnings safe (they are only allowed to pass on a question once, though), but they cannot pass on Question 15 (the last question) because \\"that would be too easy\\", stated by Chris Tarrant. =Final phase= The players then get offered between 20% and 50% of how much they had amassed in the game after Question 14. If the players accept the offer, they'll take home with them the amount of money offered and still go on to Question 15, just to see what would have happened. If the players reject the offer, they'll go on to Question 15 and try to make a correct guess. If they select a stumped celebrity, their jackpot goes up by ¬£1,000, ¬£5,000, ¬£10,000, ¬£15,000 or ¬£25,000 (depending on which ever level they were on) and the players take home with them whatever they have banked. If they select a celebrity who answered the question correctly, they'll leave empty-handed.

Career  DeGraffenried ran for Governor of Alabama on two occasions (1962 and 1966). On his first attempt, he was defeated in the Democratic primary runoff by George Wallace, who was later elected Governor. In 1966, DeGraffenried ran again as a moderate, supporting racial integration. He sought to succeed the Dixiecrat-style Wallace, who was prohibited by the constitution from running for a second term. Wallace offered his wife, Lurleen Wallace, as a surrogate candidate for governor instead. One day after qualifying for the gubernatorial race, DeGraffenried died in a plane crash while campaigning in northeast Alabama near Fort Payne. Mrs. Wallace won the nomination and gubernatorial election.  Personal life  DeGraffenried married Margaret Nell Maxwell in July 1945.

She was born and died in Valladolid, Spain. Life Marie's father, Iago de Escobar, was professor of civil and canon law and for a time governor of Osuna; her mother was Margaret Montana, daughter of the Emperor Charles V's physician.Graham, Edward. \\"Ven. Marina de Escobar.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 10 Jun. 2013 Until her forty-fifth year Marie's attention was given mainly to her own perfection, then she devoted herself more to others. At fifty her continual bodily afflictions became so severe that she was confined to her bed for the remainder of her life. Her spiritual guide was Luis de Ponte. She established a branch of the Order of the Holy Saviour or Brigittines but with the rules greatly modified. By divine command, as she believed, she wrote her revelations, and when too feeble she dictated them, Luis de Ponte arranged them and left them for publication after her death. In his preface he declares his belief in their genuineness. Works The writings were published in one large volume and are divided into six books containing Luis de Ponte's remarks and her own, interspersed between the visions themselves. Book I treats of the means by which God had led her; II contains revelations about the mysteries of redemption; III about God and the Blessed Trinity; IV about guardian angels and the Blessed Virgin Mary's prerogatives; V gives means to help souls in purgatory and to save souls on earth; and VI reveals her perfection as shown under terrible sufferings. The style of the work is free and flowing and she speaks with simplicity and na√Øve frankness. The visions are picturesque, and pleasing or alarming according to their subject, but the descriptions are mere outlines, leaving much to the imagination, and never going into details. Their variety is great, including: Daily communion and Satan's objection to it; mystic espousals; how the bodies of saints can appear in visions; internal stigmata; some saints with whom modern hagiographers have dealt harshly, as St. Christopher. Biography Her life, so far as de Ponte had written it, was published at Madrid in 1664; the second part appeared there in 1673. It was translated into Latin by M. Hanel, S.J., and published again at Prague in 1672-1688, and in an enlarged edition at Naples 1690. All these editions are now very rare. A German translation in four volumes, appeared in 1861.

It was built in 1916 as the First United Methodist Church and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History In 1868, a frame chapel for interdenominational services was built behind where the First United Methodist Church currently stands.First United Methodist Church from the State of Michigan Membership in this church declined in the 1880s, and the structure became an Episcopal chapel in 1885. In 1892, the chapel was sold to the Methodists for $1 (and assumption of the church debt). The Methodist congregation received financial support from Michigan Senator Thomas Palmer and a retired Great Lakes sea captain, Thomas Stevens. This support allowed then to construct the present Gothic structure, which was built from 1916 to 1917. In 1956, the original frame chapel behind the present church was demolished, and a contemporary educational building was constructed. Soul Harvest Ministries has occupied the building since 1995.Soul Harvest Ministries from Woodward Avenue Architecture The church is an Arts and Crafts influenced, Gothic-style structure, constructed from red brick and trimmed with limestone. The church is rectangular in plan, measuring 108 feet by 95 feet. The Woodward Avenue elevation is a three-story gabled facade with banks of leaded windows, unified by projecting brick piers with limestone detailing. A square, flat-roofed tower with a louvered belfry graces the corner of the building. The main entrance, on the Church Street elevation, is sheltered by a broad arch in the base of the tower. The Church Street elevation also has two bays containing Gothic arched windows with gabled dormers. Ornamental brickwork is placed throughout the exterior. The interior of the church is a modified Akron Plan, with a two-story central nave with sloping floors containing theatre seating. Perimeter spaces contain classrooms and overflow seating. The sanctuary is sightly raised and paneled in dark oak with a pitched beamed ceiling. It contains a carved wood altar, lecturn, and organ. The interior contains tiled floors, Arts and Crafts style oak woodwork, and tapestry brick wainscoting inset with Pewabic tiles throughout.

This is intended to be a complete list of the properties and districts on National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles, California. The locations of National Register properties and districts for which the latitude and longitude coordinates are included below may be seen in an online map. There are more than 500 properties and districts listed on the National Register in the county, including 22 National Historic Landmarks. Los Angeles is the location of 255 of these properties and districts, including 12 National Historic Landmarks; they are listed here.Searching for listings in Los Angeles in the National Register Focus database returns a different count because it includes boundary adjustments to historic districts and only includes listings through March 2010. The properties and districts elsewhere in the county, including 5 National Historic Landmarks, are listed separately. A single district, the Arroyo Seco Parkway Historic District, is split between Los Angeles and other parts of the county. Another property was once listed but has been removed. The first site in Los Angeles to be listed was the R√≥mulo Pico Adobe in the Mission Hills section of the city, which was listed in November 1966 at the inception of the Register. Several of the oldest historic sites are located in the Los Angeles Plaza Historical District in Downtown Los Angeles; these include the original Nuestra Se√±ora La Reina de Los Angeles Church (1822), the Avila Adobe, Los Angeles' oldest residence (1818), Olvera Street, the Italianate style Masonic Hall (1858), and the Italian Renaissance Revival style Merced Theater (1869). While most of the sites are office buildings or homes, two are ships,The two ships still in Los Angeles are the SS Lane Victory and the Ralph J. Scott. The SS Catalina is also listed, but was scrapped in 2009. and twenty-one are current and former branches of the Los Angeles Public Library.The Multiple Property Submission nomination explains 22 branch libraries but one, the University Branch, appears not to have been listed. Seven temples or churches are listed. At least five sites are related to rail transportation.Rail transportation sites include: Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway Steam Locomotive No. 3751, Santa Fe Freight Depot, Streetcar Depot and Subway Terminal Building. Included also are four hotels, five theaters (in addition to the Broadway Theater District), four U.S. post offices, and four fire stations. To be listed on the National Register, sites must retain their historic integrity, they usually must be 50 years old, and their listing must be promoted - or at least not opposed - by the current owner, so many historically important sites in the city are not listed. Included on the list are sites relating to the movie industry such as a former office building of the Warner Bros. studios, but no film lots or film studio buildings are listed. Despite the city's involvement in aviation history, only two sites, Hangar One and Portal of the Folded Wings, appears to relate to that. Perhaps only a Victory ship and two coastal battery sites relate to the city's military-industrial history. The listings are distributed across many neighborhoods of Los Angeles, from San Pedro in the south to the northern reaches of Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley, and from the Pacific Palisades on the west to Highland Park on the east. Thirty-eight are located in Downtown Los Angeles; 27 are in Hollywood, 16 are in West Adams, and 13 are in San Pedro. Reflecting the sprawl of Los Angeles, the city's northernmost historic site in Chatsworth (the Old Stagecoach Trail) is more than from its southernmost site in San Pedro (Point Fermin Light).

He is also known as Corentin Cariou and Tin Gariou. Youth He was born in Pont-l'Abb√©, Finist√®re into a poor family. His father died in 1911, leaving eight children to be raised by his young widow. Taken in by Catholic missionaries, he moved to Spain as a seminarian, living in the Basque region and then Castille. He met Jakez Riou and while conducting literary, scientific and religious studies, they explored the literary potential of the Breton language, aspiring to give it a refined form unsullied by convention. Having abandoned his religious training, he met, while on military service in Rennes, officials of the nationalist group Unvaniezh Yaouankiz Breiz, which led to the publication of his first article in support of Breton nationalism in the journal Breiz Atao. Literary career In 1924, he became a journalist with the Courrier du Finist√®re. He participated in the Quimper Pan-Celtic Congress of 1924, with Fran√ßois Debeauvais, Yann Sohier, Jakez Riou, Abeozen, and Marcel Guieysse, under the banner of Breiz Atao. He later worked for Gwalarn, the literary magazine founded in 1922 by Roparz Hemon and Olier Mordrel, where he established himself by publishing Breton translations from Spanish (Calderon) and ancient Greek (Aeschylus). He also published his own poetry, notably Nozvez arkus e beg an enezenn (Night Watch at the Edge of the Island), written in memory of Jakez Riou in 1938. He also translated books for children, for example Beatrix Potter. These were published by Gwalarn, and were distributed free in schools to children who had participated in essay competitions in the Breton language. Drezen's translations led to a full-time career as a writer. He produced a rich and varied oeuvre of poems, novels and plays, always written entirely in Breton. Some novels have been translated into French (by P√™r-Jakez Helias among others). He is considered one of the best writers in Breton, because he knew how to mix vivid expression with a quest for literary perfection, sometimes through euphony. He joined the Breton art and literary movement Seiz Breur. His Breton epic Kan da Gornog was published with important illustrations by Ren√©-Yves Creston. World War II During World War II, Drezen regularly published articles in the Nationalist periodical L'Heure Bretonne, an organ of the Breton National Party. He also wrote for Mordrel's Stur, Galv (edited by Henri Le Helloco) and in Yann Fou√©r√©'s La Bretagne. In 1941, he published the first full-length novel in Breton, Itron Varia Garmez, which was about the lives of ordinary people in Pont-l'Abb√© during the Great Depression (French edition, Deno√´l, 1943, as Notre-Dame Bigoudenn). It was also illustrated by Creston. Shortly afterwards, he freelanced for Radio Rennes Bretagne, writing radio plays and giving talks. In 1943, he edited the bilingual newspaper Arvor. In this paper wrote many anti- American articles about the bombing of Nantes, which reflected widespread local resentment of the attacks. He was arrested in 1944, but released after a few months. After the war After the war he remained in Nantes, where he ran a caf√©. He continued to write for Al Liamm,http://alliamm.bzh/ the journal that succeeded Gwalarn. He also wrote an autobiographical novel Skol-Louarn Veig Trebern\\"Skol-Louarn Veig Trebern\\" (\\"Veig Trebern is playing hooky\\"), foreword by P√™r-Jakez Helias, Al Liamm, 1972-1974. about his impoverished youth.

The bill passed third reading on May 14, 2008. The Act's full name is An Act to amend the Vital Statistics Act in relation to adoption information and to make consequential amendments to the Child and Family Services Act. The most significant provision of the bill was the introduction of a disclosure veto to allow adoptees and birth parents involved in adoptions prior to September 1, 2008 to prevent the release of their names, which would otherwise be available upon request by any concerned party when the adoptee reaches the age of majority. Adoptions that occurred after September 1, 2008, are open which means that when requested, identifying information about either the adoptee (as long as he/she is over 18 years of age) or the birth parents can be shared. Either party can file a \\"No Contact Notice\\" which tells the other party that they do not want to be contacted (although identifying information is still released).

Skinner used to describe a verbal operant which is controlled by a nonverbal stimulus (such as an object, event, or property of an object) and is maintained by nonspecific social reinforcement (praise). Less technically, a tact is a label. For example, a child may see their pet dog and say \\"dog\\"; the nonverbal stimulus (dog) evoked the response \\"dog\\" which is maintained by praise (or generalized conditioned reinforcement) \\"you're right, that is a dog!\\" Chapter five of Skinner's Verbal Behavior discusses the tact in depth. A tact is said to \\"make contact with\\" the world, and refers to behavior that is under the control of generalized reinforcement. The controlling antecedent stimulus is nonverbal, and constitutes some portion of \\"the whole of the physical environment.\\" The tact described by Skinner includes three important and related events, known as the 3-term-contingency: a stimulus, a response, and a consequence, in this case reinforcement. A verbal response is occasioned by the presence of a stimulus, such as when you say \\"ball\\" in the presence of a ball. In this scenario, \\"ball\\" is more likely to be reinforced by the listener than saying \\"cat\\", showing the importance of the third event, reinforcement, in relation to the stimulus (ball) and response (\\"ball\\"). Although the stimulus controls the response, it is the verbal community which establishes the stimulus' control over the verbal response of the speaker. For example, a child may say \\"ball\\" in the presence of a ball (stimulus), the child's parent may respond \\"yes, that is a ball\\", (reinforcement) thereby increasing the probability that the child will say ball in the presence of a ball in the future. On the other hand, if the parent never responds to the child saying \\"ball\\" in the presence of a ball then the probability of that response will decrease in the future. A tact may be pure or impure. For example, if the environmental stimulus evokes the response, the tact would be considered pure. If the tact is evoked by a verbal stimulus the resulting tact would be considered impure. For example, if a child is shown a picture of a dog, and emits the response \\"dog\\" this would be an example of a pure tact. If a child is shown a picture of a dog, and is given the verbal instruction \\"what is this?\\" then the response \\"dog\\" would be considered an impure tact. The tact can be extended, as in generic, metaphorical, metonymical, solecistic, nomination, and \\"guessing\\" tact. It can also be involved in abstraction. Lowe, Horne, Harris & Randle (2002) would be one example of recent work in tacts. Extensions The tact is said to be capable of generic extension. Generic extension is essentially an example of stimulus generalization. The novel stimulus contains all of the relevant features of the original stimulus. For example, we may see a red car and say \\"car\\" as well as see a white car and say \\"car\\". Different makes and models of cars will all evoke the same response \\"car\\". Tacts can be extended metaphorically; in this case the novel stimulus has only some of the defining features of the original stimulus. For example, when we describe something as \\"exploding with taste\\" by drawing the common property of an explosion with the response to our having eaten something (perhaps a strong response, or a sudden one). Tacts can undergo metonymical extension when some irrelevant but related feature of the original stimulus controls a response. In metonymical extension, one word often replaces another; we may replace a part for a whole. For example, saying \\"refrigerator\\" when shown a picture of a kitchen, or saying \\"White house\\" in place of \\"President.\\" When controlling variables unrelated to standard or immediate reinforcement take over control of the tact, it is said to be solecistically extended. Malapropisms, solecism and catachresis are examples of this. Skinner notes things like serial order, or conspicuous features of an object, may come to play as nominative tacts. A proper name may arise as a result of the tact. For example, a house that is haunted becomes \\"The Haunted House\\" as a nominative extension to the tact of its being haunted. A guess may seemingly be the emission of a response in the absence of controlling stimuli. Skinner notes that this may simply be a tact under more subtle or hidden controlling variables, although this is not always the case in something like guessing the landing side of a coin toss, where the possible alternatives are fixed and there is no subtle or hidden stimuli to control responses. Special conditions affecting stimulus control Skinner deals with factors that interfere with, or change, generalized reinforcement. It is these conditions which, in turn, affect verbal behavior which may depend largely or entirely on generalized reinforcement. In children with developmental disabilities, tacts may need intensive training procedures to develop. Factors such as deprivation, emotional conditions and personal history may interfere with or change verbal behavior. Skinner mentions alertness, irrelevant emotional variables, \\"special circumstances\\" surrounding particular listeners or speakers, etc. (He refers to the conditions which are said to produce objective and subjective responses for example). We would now look at these as motivating operations/establishing conditions. Under emersion conditions tacts will frequently emerge. However, in children with disabilities, more intensive training procedures are often needed. Distortion Distorted stimulus control may be minor as when a description (tact) is a slight exaggeration. Under stronger conditions of distortion, it may appear when the original stimulus is absent, as in the case of the response called a lie. Skinner notes that troubadours and fiction writers are perhaps both motivated by similar forms of tact distortion. Initially, they may recount real events, but as differential reinforcement affects the account we may see distortion and then total fabrication. Tact training Often, individuals with autism, developmental disabilities, or language delays have difficulty acquiring novel tacts. Many researchers in the field of verbal behavior and developmental disabilities have examined more intensive training procedures in order to teach tacts to these individuals. Specific types of prompts can be used in order to make a tact response more likely. For example, asking the student the question \\"what is this?\\" (this would be an example of an impure tact) has been used to prompt a correct tact response (this prompt can be faded until the learner can emit a pure tact). Echoic prompts (teacher repeats the correct answer which the learner must echo) have also been used to train tact responses. Kodak and Clements (2009) found that echoic training sessions before tact training was more effective at increasing independent tact responses. Skinner (1957) suggested that verbal operants were functionally independent, meaning that after teaching one verbal operant the individual may not be able to emit the topographically same response under different stimulus conditions. For example, a child may be able to request water, but may not be able to tact water. Researchers are currently examining procedures that may facilitate the generalization across verbal operants. Some studies have indicated, for example, that after teaching a child to mand for items, they could then tact them as well without direct instruction. Multiple studies have found support for the emergence of tact responses without direct instruction. These teaching procedures are especially important for individuals with autism and developmental disabilities because the learner can gain additional skills without direct instruction time.

He played piano on many of Chuck Berry's recordings. Biography Leake was born in Winona, Missouri, in 1919. Information about his early years is sparse, but in the early 1950s he joined the Big Three Trio (replacing Leonard Caston) and began his association with Chess Records, where he worked closely with bassist, producer, and songwriter Willie Dixon. Leake played piano on One Dozen Berrys, Chuck Berry's second album, released in 1958 by Chess. He was then on Chuck Berry Is on Top; Leake (not Berry's longtime bandmate Johnnie Johnson) played the prominent piano on the classic original rendition of \\"Johnny B. Goode\\", as well as \\"Rock and Roll Music\\". Leake played on numerous other Chess sessions from the '50s through the '70s, backing many of the Chess greats, including Sonny Boy Williamson, Otis Rush, Junior Wells, and Little Walter. Leake gave Chicago blues musician Harmonica Hinds his first harmonica lesson on the street in Toronto, Ontario. During the 1960s Willie Dixon formed the Chicago Blues All-Stars, with Leake as resident pianist. Leake toured and recorded with this group until the mid-1970s. After that he did little recording or touring, although he appeared with Chuck Berry at the Chicago Blues Festival in 1986 and recorded \\"Hidden Charms\\" with Willie Dixon in 1988. Besides being a respected performer, Leake was a composer. He recorded a number of his own songs as a member of various ensembles, and others have been covered by notable musicians. Fleetwood Mac, for example, recorded his song \\"Love That Woman\\" on their album The Original Fleetwood Mac. Leake's song \\"Wrinkles\\", performed by the Big Three Trio, was featured on the soundtrack of David Lynch's 1990 film, Wild at Heart. Blues band Slo Leak was named after one of Leake's instrumental pieces. Leake fell into a diabetic coma in his home in Chicago, where he remained undiscovered for several days, dying in hospital on August 14, 1990. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Lafayette Leake among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Major recordings *Might is Right!

This second church was built c. 1179 by John Fitzherbert, 3rd Lord of Norbury and dedicated to St Barlacus. The saint appears in the centre light of the south window; he is portrayed holding a pastoral staff in his left hand and a book in his right. Underneath there are the words Sactus Burlok Abbas. The name also appears as Saint Barlok in a 1491 charter.Cox, J. Charles. 1877. Notes on the Churches of Derbyshire. Page 246. Chesterfield, Edmonds. Saint Barlock has been identified with Saint Finbarr, an Irish abbot and bishop of the 7th century and the patron saint of Cork.

The present church of St Mary and St Barlock was built piecemeal over a period of about 200 years. The chancel is the earliest part of the church, and is unusually large in relation to the rest of the fabric. It is long, and is both wider and higher than the nave (which at is slightly longer). The design of the chancel windows' tracery indicates a building date of c. 1300‚Äì1310, as does the contemporary armorial glass. Two of the arms depicted are those of Otton de Grandson who left England in 1307, and Robert the Bruce, at war with England from 1306. The roof of the chancel is a later 15th century wooden construction; external buttresses and internal shafts running up to the roof line indicate that the original design may have intended a fan vault, never built. The south tower, nave and chapel east of the tower were built by Nicholas Fitzherbert (d. 1473), he or his son Ralph (d. 1483) built the north aisle, and his grandson John Fitzherbert (d. 1513) built the south-west chapel, which was finished in 1517. Much of the stained glass added by the Fitzherberts survives; these are for the most part figures painted in grisaille. In the south-east chapel there is a window showing the donor and his family. =Fitzherbert memorials= Ralph Fitzherbert in Alabaster Ralph's wife Nicholas Fitzherbert's tomb Benedicta Fitzherbert's tomb There are a number of memorials to the Fitzherbert family in the church, including Sir Henry (d. 1315) depicted as a cross-legged knight, Nicholas (d. 1473) carved in alabaster with attendant mourners, and Sir Ralph Fitzherbert (d. 1483) and his wife, again in alabaster. The crossed legs of Henry, 6th Lord of Norbury c. 1275- c. 1315 indicate his profession of Christian faith and not participation in a Crusade; although his year of death is uncertain it is known that he was not a Crusader Nicholas Fitzherbert, High Sheriff of Derbyshire and 11th Lord of Norbury died in 1473. He is shown in full plate armour with a collar of alternating suns and roses with a pendant of the White Lion of the House of Marche, the badge of Edward IV. There is a small angel supporting his right foot. Ralph's feet rest on a lion; next to it and under Ralph's shoe crouches the small figure of a bedesman. The bearded bedesman is telling his rosary for the souls of the departed. Ralph bears the Yorkist livery collar of alternating suns and roses, with the White Boar of Richard III as a pendant. Since the destruction of the effigy of Ralph Neville (d. 1484) at Brancepeth, this is the only surviving representation of a boar pendant. The armour portrayed on the effigy of Ralph Fitzherbert has been reproduced as a fully functional suit of plate. An incised effigy on an alabaster slab of a woman tied in a shroud has been identified as that of Benedicta (d. 1531) wife of John Fitzherbert, 13th Lord. The effigy is surrounded with four coats of arms, one of which is of the Bradbourne family of Benedicta. Above the figure is a worn inscription with the date 1531. John Fitzherbert separated from Benedicta early in their marriage. In his will he disinherited Benedicta and denied paternity of her children, stating \\"‚Ä¶Bennett my wyffe hath been of lewd and vile disposicion and cowde not be content with me but forsaken my houshoolde and company and lyffed in other places where yt pleased her.\\"Bowyer, L.J.

By 1770 the glass was in very bad condition. At that time the rectors of parishes were personally responsible for the financing of repairs to their churches- so the rector of Norbury, the Rev. S. Mills, had the window bricked up with the glass remaining in situ. In 1830 the then rector, the Rev. Thomas Bingham,Noble, Thomas (Ed.). 1829. The History, Gazetteer and Directory of the County of Derby. p 587. Stephen Glover. was approached by a Roman Catholic family of Yorkshire with a view to purchasing the glass. Whether the glass was removed and sold, or stolen (as happened at Haddon Hall), or had disintegrated is not known, but it had disappeared by 1842 when the window was opened up again and filled with 15th century glass taken from the rest of the church windows.Bowyer, L.J.

Horn would often furtively practice music instead; when his father found out, he destroyed the family's clavichord in the hopes of preventing his son from becoming distracted from his studies. This, though, did not dissuade Horn from taking music lessons from Nordhausen organist Christoph Gottlieb Schr√∂ter.Horn, 1. On Schr√∂ter's death in 1782, Horn decided to move to Paris to try a living as a musician. He left his home with little money and a suitcase of clothes. En route to Paris, he encountered a stranger in Hamburg by the name of Winkelman, who persuaded the impressionable Horn that London would better serve the aspirations of a young German musician than France.Horn, 1‚Äì2. Winkelman accompanied him to London, but upon arriving, stole almost all of Horn's money and disappeared.Kassler, \\"Horn, Charles Frederick (1762‚Äì1830)\\". Destitute and knowing no English, he wandered the streets of London before encountering a German-speaking Irishman, who sympathised with his plight. The man took Horn to the piano shop of Longman and Broderip at Cheapside, where Horn played the piano for its co- proprietor, Francis Fane Broderip.Horn, 3. Impressed, Broderip introduced Horn to the Saxon ambassador John Maurice de Br√ºhl. de Br√ºhl recommended Horn to Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, who hired him as his daughters' music teacher. The appointment meant that Trentham Hall, Leveson- Gower's estate in Staffordshire, became Horn's new residence. There, he met and fell in love with Diana Dupont, the French tutor of Leveson-Gower's daughters. The two married on 28 September 1785, and subsequently moved to London, where Dupont gave birth to the couple's first child, Charles Edward Horn, on 21 June 1786. Horn published his first composition, Six Sonatas for the Piano, Violin, and Violoncello (Op. 1), earlier that year in May. Subscribers to the work included such luminaries as Muzio Clementi, Johann Peter Salomon, George IV (then the Prince of Wales), and Lady Caroline Waldegrave.Kassler, \\"Horn, Charles Frederick [Karl Friedrich]\\". The latter introduced Horn to Queen Charlotte, who appointed him as her personal music tutor; he instructed the Queen twice a week from 20 October 1789 to 9 October 1793. While in her service, he maintained two homes, one in London and the other in Windsor. He was also engaged from June 1789 to October 1812 to teach music to the royal princesses. During his employment in the royal household, he composed a set of three Sonatas (Op. 2), which he dedicated to the Queen.Horn, 83. Horn continued composing numerous pieces, but he is perhaps best known for his work in arranging and editing music‚Äîin particular, the works of Bach. In 1807, he published an arrangement for two violins, viola, and cello/piano for 12 of Bach's organ fugues. The next year, he met Samuel Wesley, with whom he would collaborate in editing, arranging, and publishing the first ever complete edition of Bach's six trio sonatas for organ (1809) and the first English edition of the Well-Tempered Clavier (1810). Horn, whom Wesley described as \\"indefatigable\\", had plans to publish all of Bach's works, but this never came to fruition. In June 1824, King George IV appointed Horn as organist of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He stepped down after King George's death on 26 June 1830, and died shortly after in Windsor. He was buried at St George's Chapel. Horn was survived by his wife, with whom he had seven children.

In 1982 Kolkoutine graduated at the Repin Academy of Arts in Leningrad, named after Ilya Repin. Currently Kolkoutine lives in southern Russia in the town of Nalchik. He belongs to the art group \\" FOSTER BROTHERS \\" together with two other famous artists - Andrey Efi and Eugeny Lindin. The medium of his paintings is usually oil on canvas, but Kolkoutine also made a few sculptures and graphic works. Besides Russia, Kolkoutine has made exhibitions in Denmark, Germany, France and other European countries as well as the United States.  Style  Kolkoutine settled into his current characteristic style by the end of the 1980s in which he mixes traditions from the Russian icons with suprematism from Malevich, cubism and na√Øve art. Kolkoutine states that he sought the special tones of colours which are seen in the old Russian icons, and he developed a method for making these tones by pasting a layer of neutral grey paint on the canvas before painting the colours. Suprematist elements are combined with figurative elements. Distorted buildings and playing cards may appear at the bottom of the paintings as well as Cyrillic letters. Frames in different colours surrounding the motifs are often oblique.  Motifs  Often the motifs are either stylized biblical or simple working people from the Russian province; according to Kolkoutine the biblical characters are in principle the same kind as the provincial people (Bj√∏rnager, 2006). The biblical motifs are also a reflection of his origin; they are distinctly orthodox. Jekatarina Seleznjova states that in her opinion the fundamental question asks in his paintings is \\"Why are we here?\\" (Seleznjova, 2007), and thus despite the culturally characteristic motifs Kolkoutine's paintings are supposed to touch something universally human. Kolkoutines paintings are both simple and complicated it is said.

She founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon in 1808 after the French Revolution and served as its first Superior General. Life Born in Bas-en- Basset, Haute Loire, she was the youngest child of Michel and Jeanne Theill√®re Fontbonne. In 1778 she entered a house of the Sisters of St. Joseph, which had just been established at Monistrol (Haute-Loire) by Bishop de Gallard of Le Puy. The following year she received the religious habit. At the age of 26 she was chosen by the community to be their Superior and remained there until the French Revolution. She and her sisters established a hospitalRudge, F.M. \\"Jeanne Fontbonne.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 March 2020 (not a medical institution, but rather a place to receive the poor). At the outbreak of the French Revolution she and her community followed Bishop de Gallard in refusing to sign the Oath of Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Forced to disperse her community, she remained until she was forced to leave, and the convent taken possession of by the Commune. She returned to her father's home, and was soon imprisoned for 11 months at Saint-Didier and only the fall of Robespierre on the day before that appointed for the execution saved her from the guillotine. Unable to regain possession of her convent at Monistrol, she and her sister, who had been her companion in prison, returned again to their father's house, where she and a few companions continued their charitable works among the poor.\\"Mother St. John Fontbonne\\", Sisters of St. Joseph of Toronto Twelve years later (1807), Mother St. John was called to Saint-√âtienne to assume responsibility for Les Filles Noire, a group of 12 young women and members of dispersed congregations. At the request of Cardinal Fesch, Archbishop of Lyon, and under Mother St. John's formation, these women became the first Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon. She restored the asylum at Monistrol, eventually was able to repurchased and reopened the former convent, and on 10 April 1812, the congregation received Government authorization. In 1816 Mother St. John was appointed Superior General of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lyon. She went to Lyon to find and purchase property to build a motherhouse and novitiate on rue des Chartreux. Before the Revolution, small groups of Sisters lived close to the people, wearing ordinary dress, they visited the homes of people who were sick and poor and helped all in need. The government required a different model, centralized into diocesan congregations focused on education. By 1830, the Sisters were wearing an official habit for the first time. During her years of leadership, she established and reorganized pre-revolutionary communities to become satellites of the Motherhouse. By the end of her leadership, she was responsible for establishing a number of new congregations in France and Italy as well as over 240 communities of the Lyon congregation. In 1836 at the request of Bishop Rosati of the St. Louis, Missouri, Diocese she sent six sisters to America. She kept in constant correspondence with them. And thus began the expansion of numerous congregations of the Sisters of St. Joseph in the United States and Canada.

It is native to California and Baja California, where it grows in the chaparral and woodland of coastal and inland hills. Description Arctostaphylos glauca is a large shrub varying in size from one to well over six meters in height. Individuals growing in desert regions tend to be shorter than those on the coast. Leaves are light gray-green, somewhat waxy, oval in shape to nearly round, and smooth or toothed along the edges. They are up to five centimeters long and four wide and grow on short petioles about a centimeter long. The inflorescence holds hanging clusters of narrow urn-shaped white flowers. The edible fruit is a round or egg-shaped drupe 12 to 15 millimeters wide. It is light red in color and has a thick pulp covered in a tough, sticky coat. The fruit contains three to six nutlets fused into a single mass. The shrub reproduces by seed and by layering. Seeds require exposure to fire before they can germinate. It is a long-lived species, reaching 100 years of age or more, though it does not begin to fruit until it is around 20 years old. The shrub is allelopathic, inhibiting the growth of other plants in its understory when rain leaches toxic arbutin and phenolic acids from its foliage.Ecology Uses Despite their constipating effects, the fruits were eaten by the Native Americans of California, who also made the ripe fruit into a cider.

Along with the Korea Army Academy (Yeongcheon), it produces the largest number of senior officers in the Korean army. Commonly referred to as Hwarangdae ( Hanja: Ëä±ÈÉûËá∫)) as a reference to the Hwarang, an elite organization of youth leaders which existed in Korean history, it is located in Nowon-gu, a northeast district of Seoul, South Korea.  History  The Academy was founded on May 1, 1946, as South Joseon Defense Academy by National Defense Command, the predecessor of Ministry of National Defense of Republic of Korea, under the authority of then-U.S. military administration in South Korea. With the end of the Pacific War and the subsequent disbandment of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had been occupying Korea since 1910, a void of indigenous security force was created, while the pool of human resource was composed of various backgrounds, including the Imperial Japanese Army, Manchurian Army, and Korean Liberation Army. As a preparatory measure, the U.S. military administration opened the Military Language School in Seoul on December 5, 1945, in order to train military interpreters as well as the new generation of commissioned officers with unified, predominantly American military doctrine. Following the establishment of the South Joseon National Defense Force, the predecessor of the Republic of Korea Army, in January 1946, the School closed down on April 30, and South Joseon Defense Academy was founded the next day, taking over 60 cadets from the school and augmented by 28 new officer candidates drafted from line units. Henceforth, May 1 has been recognized as the official foundation day of KMA. Cham-ryeong (current rank of major) Lee Hyeong-geun was appointed as the first superintendent of the Academy, and Bu- wi (current rank of first lieutenant) Jang Chang-kuk was appointed as the commandant. Following the establishment of the South Korean government on August 15, 1948, the National Defense Force was renamed to 'Republic of Korea Army', and so was South Joseon Defense Academy to 'Korea Military Academy' accordingly.

American Orient Express, formerly the American European Express, operated a single luxury passenger train set in charter service between 1989 and 2008 and operated on routes throughout North America. The company was based in Seattle, Washington. Background A full dome car was added to the consist in the mid 2000s and offered a panoramic view of the passing landscape. The train was priced from $2,000 to $10,000 per trip one way and included meals, entertainment, and hotel stays. The train operated under contract with Amtrak and used both Amtrak locomotives and crews. It typically ran on freight only routes that had not seen passenger service in more than 50 years. Some of the more popular routes included the Los Angeles‚ÄìWashington, D.C., transcontinental (taking eight days) and the Rocky Mountain Adventure. Both featured scenic segments with long layovers at certain stops, similar to a cruise ship. The trips were only one way, requiring debarking passengers to either take a bus or airplane to return to their home terminal. Luxury passenger train excursions, including the AOE, ceased operations during the late 2000s recession. During the final excursions, it was not uncommon for there to be more crew members than passengers on the train. As part of a restructuring, the train was briefly renamed GrandLuxe Journeys with trips primarily running into Mexico.

It is the second MMO published by Outspark. Secret of the Solstice features a cute, anime-inspired visual style. Player characters, monsters, and non-player characters (NPCs) are represented as 2D sprites while environments and background elements are rendered in 3D. US Secret of the Solstice was subsequently shut down by its publisher 'Outspark' for 'undisclosed reasons'. Any and all time and real money that players put into the game was lost. However outspark offered a character merge to 'Solstice Reborn' a beta of a new release of Solstice. On October 24, 2011 the Beta was released for 1 week until it closed and Outspark removed all traces of its existence. Outspark also shut down their forums for comments on 'Solstice'. Secret of the Solstice was re-launched in 2020 with the name \\"Xen Rebirth\\" as a non-profit, running entirely on donations. Story It is said that during days in a time long past, peace was more than an empty word. A great King, mighty and fair, ruled the land of Xen with responsibility entrusted to him by the gods before they left the mortal plane. With this trust came the Solstice Sphere, an ancient and mysterious artifact possessing great power. In time the king married and the union yielded twin daughters, Adeline and Marian. They were like the sun and the moon, opposites but forever entwined with the future of Xen. Time passed and the princesses grew, reaching womanhood before the eyes of their people. Adeline became a shining beauty, like the sun with a heart of gold. The people of Xen adored her. Always at her father's side, she watched and learned as the King went about his duties. With a thirst for knowledge, she learned from the greatest teachers in the land. It was her destiny to one day inherit the throne and become the kingdom's future. While Adeline became like the sun, Marian grew to become the moon. In the shadow of her sister she became envious, and the darkness of jealousy soaked her heart. While admirers heaped endless praise on Adeline, seeds of bitterness and resentment began to grow in Marian. Hidden under the sheen of superficial happiness, they waited for the perfect moment to bloom. Years passed, and the princesses approached the age of 18. On their birthday Adeline received a special gift from her parents‚Äîthe Solstice Sphere! On that day the mysterious ancient relic passed from father to daughter. But it was far from a glorious occasion. A series of horrific events would soon take place and ultimately drench the land of Xen in the suffering it knows today. Character Creation On each server of the game, players can have up to five characters. These characters can be either male or female. Both genders have three hair styles, of which each have three possible colors. Character Classes =Xenian= Residents of Xen. All players start as Xenians and specialize to another class later. =Squire= Fighters train in the arts of the Akarinas sword, and are awarded their class after qualifying to join a vigilance committee. They have strong melee attacks and high defensive capabilities but have weaker skills than the other classes. Squires can become Knights at level 66, Warriors at level 96 and Warlords at level 131. =Apprentice= Magician apprentices who wield magic to defend themselves, fighting from a distance. They can deal massive damage with their spells, but are vulnerable in melee combat as they have low armor and hit points. Apprentices can become Mages at level 66, Wizards at level 96 and Archmages at level 131. =Neophyte= Neophytes are known for their cunning and speed. They have powerful attacks but tend to have medium hit points and defense. Neophytes can class change to Rogue at 66, Assassin at 96 and finally to Shadow Master at 131. =Acolyte= Well on their way to being a full cleric, acolytes focus on helping others with their protective, healing magic. They have powerful healing and supportive magic as well as decent melee skills. Acolytes become Clerics at level 66, Priests at level 96, and finally Paladins at level 131 =Prestige Classes= At level 45, both the Neophyte and Acolyte have the ability to move on to a different class called 'Prestige Classes'. The Neophyte can become a Scout, while an Acolyte can become a Disciple. At 80, these two can advance again. Scouts become Archers and Disciples become Templars. Finally, at level 112, they reach full potential and become a Ranger (if Neophyte) and Holy Avenger (if Acolyte). Statistics Upon leveling up, players may increase any one of their six stats and customize their character. The six statistics are: Power, Agility, Intelligence, Wisdom, Stamina, and Mentality. Power increases a player's damage, and weight capacity. Too much power decreases attack speed. Agility increases dodge rate, attack speed, and attack power. Intelligence is beneficial to ranged characters. While it increases a spell's damage, it does nothing for close ranged characters. Wisdom increases a player's maximum MP or Mana Points, and increases magic defense. Stamina increases a player's maximum HP or Health Points. Mentality increases accuracy rate, defense, magic defense, and skill casting speed. Gameplay Players learn skills upon changing jobs. A Skill Book is required to learn skills. There are three skill types: single-target \\"General Skills\\", multi-target \\"Area of Effect(AoE) Skills\\", and \\"Buff Skills\\", which strengthen characters. Skills are limited according to the character's level and job. Secret of the Solstice supports a Party System which allows up to eight characters to team up for adventures. Experience is distributed to the participants depending on their levels. There is a bonus for variety in the party as well as a bonus for having a member of the starter class in your party Secret of the Solstice players have a three- tab inventory. Spend, Gear, and Other. Items in the 'Spend' tab are consumable items. Items in the 'Gear' tab are equipable items. Items in the 'Other' tab are miscellaneous items. These are often quest-related. Players can also engage in a quest to obtain pets. Different types of pets can be obtained from various 'pet merchants' in the game. All classes have equipment, or Gear, that is restricted to their class. When players undergo their first class change, they are granted their equipment by the leader of the class, along with an accessory. When a player dies in Secret of the Solstice, they are sent back to the last recorded town with a minor loss of experience. Secret of Solstice does contain a player controlled marketplace. Players can choose to sell items in their inventory for whatever price they choose. Messaging Secret of the Solstice offers four modes of in-game chat. Local, Party, Guild, and Shout.

Some of the best features in SoS scream for the game to play offline in a single player experience. While all of those features are still enjoyable in a MMOG, they make for a lackluster experience. Without a doubt, Outspark will find an audience that is bananas over this game, but I can‚Äôt help but feel confused by what it is trying to be. I never got around to all of the bells and whistles (crafting and such) offered in SoS because I was not motivated by the game play. 2.5/5.\\"http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62691  References   External links  * Secret of Solstice Official English Language Site * Secret of Solstice Community page Category:2008 video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games developed in South Korea Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games ","title":"Secret of the Solstice"},{"id":"17443758","text":"Holofernes was an Assyrian invading general of Nebuchadnezzar, who appears in the deuterocanonical Book of Judith.

Tongnip Sinmun was the first privately managed modern daily newspaper in Korea. It was founded in July 1896 by a member of the enlightened Korean intelligentsia, Seo Jae-pil (later known as Philip Jaisohn). It constituted two different language editions: Korean and English. Originally, it was published every other day and developed into a daily newspaper in Korean. The English edition, originally published every other day like the Korean edition, was later only published weekly. It has been estimated that the paper's average circulation per issue was between two and three thousand copies.Schmid, Andre (2002). Korea Between Empires, 1895-1919. New York: Columbia University Press, p. 51. Background The key figure in the paper's establishment was undeniably Seo Jae-pil. After the failure of the progressive Gapsin Coup in 1884, Seo sought refuge in the United States. In exile he learned from Pak Yeong-hyo (, ) that he had been pardoned from the charge of high treason as of March 1895, and further, that his \\"Gaehwapa\\" (, lit. reformist) comrades had come to power during his exile. As a result, he decided to return to Korea in December of that year. Front page of the English edition of The Independent (1896). In Korea, the Prime Minister, Kim Hong-jip (, ) persuaded Seo to join the cabinet as the Oemu hyeoppan (Ïô∏Î¨¥ÌòëÌåê, the modern equivalent to Minister of Foreign Affairs). However, Seo rejected the proposal, urging grassroots enlightenment to be a more urgent matter than his entry into the national cabinet. Seo viewed the absence of support from the populous as the primary cause of the Gapsin Coup failure. He also judged that the success of the Gabo reform (1894) was reliant solely on the support from the public. In order to achieve this support, it was most imperative to have a progressive newspaper as a vehicle of mass education. Accordingly, in January 1896 Seo Jae-pil and Yu Gil-chun reached an agreement to establish a non- governmental newspaper company and to publish both Korean and English editions beginning March 1 of that same year. The Kim Hong-jip cabinet backed the plan vehemently. Indeed, the cabinet promised to grant him a fund (300 won a month) from the government budget and even appointed Seo as an advisor to the Jungchuwon (Ï§ëÏ∂îÏõê, ‰∏≠Ê®ûÈô¢), or Privy Council. Even though the collapse of the Kim Hong-jip cabinet resulted in the loss of support of such prominent figures as Yu Gil-chun, Seo did receive from the succeeding Pak Jung-yang cabinet re- approval of the plan to establish the newspaper. The Pak cabinet spent 3,000 won plus another 1,400 won for paper's the founding funds and Seo's living expenses respectively. Seo purchased a printer and printing types from Japan. He rented a government-owned building in the Jung-dong district of Seoul, launched the Tongnip Sinmun newspaper company, and published its first edition in April 1896. In short, the Tongnip Sinmun was the result of joint work between Seo Jae-pil and the government under the cabinets of both Kim and Park. Seo Jae-pil was the chief editor of the newly launched paper. For the editorial sections of both the Korean and English versions, Ju Si-gyeong acted as an assistant editor. At the time it was published, it was a tabloid newspaper (8.6 x 12.9) and was published three times a week (every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday), comprising 4 pages in total. The first three pages were printed in Korean and the last page, entitled ‚ÄúThe Independent‚Äù, in English . Unlike existing governmental bulletins, it also covered practical matters. It contents generally included editorials, local items, official bulletins, as well as a digest of domestic and foreign news and miscellaneous information, including advertisements. Development and discontinuance Philip Jaisohn The Tongnip Sinmun went through four phases from its start to discontinuance. The first phase was the period from April 7 to July 2, 1896, which was the interval of time between the first publication of the newspaper and the establishment of the Tongnip Hyeophoe (ÎèÖÎ¶ΩÌòëÌöå , lit. \\"Independence Club\\"). During this period the primary focus of the newspaper concerned national enlightenment. Also during this period, the Tongnip Sinmun was very cooperative with the government and provided the reading public with explanations of government policies. Its articles were politically moderate in tone even as it began to exert its influence on national consciousness and thought. The second phase was from July 4, 1896, to May 11, 1898. This was the period from the establishment of Tongnip Hyeophoe to the point that Seo transferred the Tongnip Sinmun to Yun Chi-ho (Ïú§ÏπòÌò∏, Â∞πËá¥Êòä). During this period, the paper supported Tongnip Hyeophoe-led projects, i.e., the construction of Independence Gate, Tongnip Park and the Tongnipgwan (Independence Hall), and focused its efforts more on grassroots enlightenment. There was also a change in the newspaper format in this period. The English edition was published separately and its content expanded twofold. Yun Chiho The newspaper established branch offices in Jemulpo and Shanghai and stationed correspondents there. In the midst of increasing conflicts between reformists and conservatives within the Korean cabinet, the Tongnip Hyephoe was gradually suppressed by pro-Russia conservatives. In August 1897, the Russian government dispatched a military instructor and a financial adviser to Korea for the purpose of intervention and exploitation. In response to these developments, the Tongnip Sinmun began to criticize the government by reporting on corrupt officials and unjustifiable Russian intervention. In December 1897, the Tongnip Sinmun was faced with discontinuance due to its criticisms of pro- Russia conservatives. Even foreign diplomats pressured Korea's King Gojong to implement censureship controls over the paper when in 1898 it published some secret documents revealing Russian and Japanese plans to exact concessions from the Korean government. Certain elements of the foreign community feared that an active press might interfere with \\"concession diplomacy\\" by mobilizing the Korean public against the granting of special privileges to foreign interests. Ultimately, the government decided to expel Seo from Korea and allow the continued publication of the paper under Yun Chi-ho. Though Gojong did prepare laws pertaining to censuring the press, none were actually promulgated.Schmid (2002), p. 53. The paper's third phase extended from the time Yun ascended to the position of chief editor until the dismantling of the Tongnip Hyeophoe (i.e., May to December, 1898) During this period, the Tongnip Sinmun played the role of mouthpiece for the increasingly embattled Tongnip Hyeophoe while also serving to enlighten the people. From July 1898, it began daily publication in Korean (though not in English). The publication's fourth phase was the period from the dissolution of Tongnip Hyeophoe to the discontinuance of the newspaper itself. After the breakup of the Tongnip Hyeophoe, Yun Chi-ho, the chief editor of the paper and president of Tongnip Hyeophoe, was appointed to an official government position and left Seoul. Thus, changes were inevitable. For the first several months, H.G. Appenzeller assumed the job of chief editor. He was soon followed in this position by H. Emberly in June, 1899. The newspaper tried to maintain its founding principles, however, it toned down its criticism and focused more on education and enlightenment at the grassroots level. Despite its continued publication, such aforementioned changes, as well as increasing government oppression, naturally led to the paper's loss of dignity as a newspaper. The authorities attempted searching the newspaper offices and arrested journalists who wrote stories on corrupted officialdom. In a bid to purchase the Tongnip Sinmun, the government even demanded the return of the paper's office building in July, 1899. Considering it was operating under debt, this had serious repercussions for the newspaper. In response to these developments, U.S. minister to Korea Horace Allen arranged for mediation between the government and Seo Jae-pil, still a substantial leader behind the scenes. As a result, on December 24, 1899, Seo finally agreed to sell the newspaper to the government for the price of 4,000 won. The Tongnip Sinmun published its final issue on December 4, 1899. After the government takeover the paper was discontinued permanently.

The hamlet was settled by the British in the seventeenth century. Located in the northern tier of the Catskill mountains, settlement was not facilitated by terrain. The Catskill Creek, which flows through Livingstonville, is too shallow to allow significant travel. Early in the nineteenth century, the town of Broome was incorporated into Schoharie County. Livingstonville is the largest hamlet in the town and is where the highway department is located. For Schoharie County residents, Livingstonville was notable as the home of the \\"Trailer Graveyard\\" where hundreds of abandoned trailers were left near a pond. In the 2000s this pile was cleaned. Now cleaned, the pond has been restored to its natural state. In the past Livingstonville was thriving, there was a small store which closed in the early 1990s, a gas station which had a souvenir shop called Losee's after the family who owned it. Up until the early 1980s there was a hotel with a restaurant and bar which was a community gathering point.  Today  Livingstonville is located in a valley. The Town of Broome volunteer fire department, which is located in Livingstonville, offers Bingo in the spring and summer, Seasonal Dances, Pot Luck Dinners, as well as a Labor Day BBQ which people from various states attend. During the months between May thru October there is a flea market. Students from Livingstonville attend Middleburgh Central School. Livingstonville is also in Middleburgh's Zip Code of 12122. The Highway Department, located in Livingstonville, is functional. Livingstonville tends to vote overwhelmingly Republican. Despite this, the Supervisor of Broome is Marie Campbell, a Democrat.New York State Archives - Grants and Awards - LGRMIF Possible future Supervisors include Brian Chichester, who recently retired from the town road crew.

Egoboo has been downloaded over 590,000 times since its first release over Sourceforge alone until mid 2016, while Egoboo can be downloaded from other sources as well.  History  The original Egoboo was the creation of Aaron Bishop (who was at first known only as \\"Programmer X\\") in 1999. With the help of his brother Ben Bishop, he eventually released it as open source. In 2001 an alpha was released.egoboo-alpha-is-downloadbaar on gamer.nl (2001) Soon after this, however, Aaron stopped developing the project and it was abandoned. Fairly soon after this, the \\"Zippy Project\\" took over, and the game's development continued. The Zippy project eventually died as well. After this, it was taken over by Johan Jansen (alias \\"Zefz\\") and the \\"Resurrection\\" project. Currently Egoboo is being developed by the previous \\"Resurrection\\" project, which has reorganized itself as the official development team.  Plot  Egoboo's story revolves around the capture of Lord Bishop, the king of Bishopia. He was taken away by the evil Dracolich for unknown reasons, and brave adventurers have risen up to try to rescue him. The Dracolich hid in the Abyss, which is only accessible through secret Catacombs. The Catacombs are sealed, however, and can only be unlocked by the Legendary Sporks of Yore. Characters must progress through the five Palaces in order to retrieve the Sporks so that the Catacombs can be opened.  Gameplay  A screenshot from Egoboo The player must progress through areas (Palace, Catacomb, Abyss) in order to proceed and finish the main storyline. The game has no world map. Instead, locations are selected from a list of available \\"modules\\" which unlock more modules when finished. Egoboo currently features eleven playable character classes, each with its own unique abilities and skills. Each one has its own special \\"starter module.\\" When the player completes a starter module, the character is saved and can enter the other areas of the game. There is no limit to how many of each class the player saves, but there is a limit to how many total characters can be displayed on the character selection screen. All of the classes but four are available at the beginning of the game. The Zombi, G'nome, Tourist and Archaeologist classes are unlocked when certain requirements are met. \\"Hero classes\\" are currently being made, which are 'level ups' of the base classes. Each hero class has advanced skills, but also some disadvantages. Much of the game revolves around combat. There are several different types of weapons (crushing, slashing, etc.) that do different types of damage (e.g. cuts, piercings, fire, ice). Each type of weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages, and depending on the type of damage they deal, they may be more or less effective against certain monsters. In addition to normal melee (or ranged) combat, some character classes are able to use magic. Magic is divided into two types, divine and arcane. Divine magic focuses on healing. It can be used when no weapons are in the characters hand to heal nearby allies, or it can be channeled by special Relics with even more powerful effects. Arcane magic is used through books, which can create various magical effects, some more powerful than others. Most Arcane magic focuses on attacks or enchantments. All magic uses up mana, which can be restored with special potions, and also naturally regenerates. Currently only co-operative play on a single machine is available. The developers hope to eventually add full online multiplayer support with multiple modes of play, including competitive game modes.  Development  Egoboo is not yet considered to be complete, though it has been developed for approximately ten years, with new versions being released periodically. Currently the game is developed primarily by a four- person development team, but several other contributors also work on creating new modules (maps), items, monsters, and character classes. The game can be easily edited so new weapons, monsters, etc. can be added without altering the underlying source code. Egoboo has its own scripting language that is used for editing all objects (which includes characters, items, monsters, furniture, etc.). All these objects use 3D models with a .md2 format, and textures (primarily in .png and .bmp formats). The game's modules are edited and created with an external program called Egomap. Unfortunately, Egomap has a reputation for being buggy, and is not being actively developed.  Reception  Egoboo has achieved some popularity in the open-source gaming community, has been downloaded over 590,000 times until July 2016, and has been integrated in several linux distributions.egoboo in Ubuntuegoboo in Fedora on RPM search Egoboo received reception from various game and open-source focussed news outlets over the years.Interview: Developing Open Source games at Linux.comNewsforge Interview. on NewsForge Retrieved on 2008-05-15.

It is similar to a home oxygen concentrator (OC), but is smaller in size and more mobile. They are small enough to carry and many are now FAA-approved for use on airplanes.  Development  Medical oxygen concentrators were developed in the late 1970s. Early manufacturers included Union Carbide and Bendix Corporation. They were initially conceived of as a method of providing a continuous source of home oxygen without the use of heavy tanks and frequent deliveries. Beginning in the 2000s, manufacturers developed portable versions. Since their initial development, reliability has been improved, and POCs now produce between one and six liters per minute (LPM) of oxygen depending the breathing rate of the patient. The latest models of intermittent flow only products weighed in the range of from 2.8 to 9.9 pounds (1.3 to 4.5 kg) and continuous flow (CF) units were between 10 and 20 pounds (4.5 to 9.0 kg).  Operation  POCs operate on the same principle as a home concentrator, pressure swing adsorption. The basic set up of a POC is a miniaturized air compressor, a cylinder filled containing the sieve, a pressure equalizing reservoir and valves and tubes. During the first half of the first cycle the internal compressor forces this air through a system of chemical filters known as a molecular sieve. This filter is made up of silicate granules called zeolite which attract (via adsorption) nitrogen molecules onto their surfaces more strongly than they attract oxygen molecules ‚Äì this takes the nitrogen out of the air and concentrates the oxygen. When the desired purity is reached and the first cylinder reaches roughly 20 psi the oxygen and small amounts of other gases are released into the pressure equalizing reservoir. As the pressure in the first cylinder drops the nitrogen is desorbed, the valve is closed, and the gas is vented into the ambient air. Most of the oxygen produced is delivered to the patient; part is fed back into the sieves (at greatly reduced pressure) to flush away left over nitrogen, and prepare the zeolite for the next cycle. The atmosphere contains around 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen; the 1% remainder is a mixture of other gases which pass through this process. A POC system is functionally a nitrogen scrubber capable of consistently producing medical-grade oxygen of up to 90%. A Zen-O portable oxygen concentrator; it is capable of pulse and continuous flow operation The most important consideration for a POC is its ability to supply adequate supplementary oxygen to relieve hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) during normal activities and based on the patients breathing cycles. Other variables include maximum oxygen purity, the number and increment of settings for adjusting oxygen flow, and battery capacity (or number of add-on batteries) and power cord options for recharging. = Pulse dose = Pulse dose (also called intermittent-flow or on-demand) POCs are the smallest units, often weighing as little as 5 pounds (2.2 kg). Their small size enables the patient to not waste energy gained from the treatment on carrying them. Here the unit intermittently administers a volume (or bolus) of oxygen in milliliters per breath (mL/breath). Their ability to conserve oxygen is key to keeping the units so compact without sacrificing the duration of oxygen supply. Most of the current POC systems provide oxygen on a pulse (on-demand) delivery and are used with a nasal cannula to deliver the oxygen to the patient. = Continuous flow = With continuous flow units, oxygen delivery is measured in LPM (liters per minute). Providing continuous flow requires a larger molecular sieve and pump/motor assembly, and additional electronics. This increases the device‚Äôs size and weight (approximately 18‚Äì20 lbs). There are some units available that are capable of functioning in either mode. With on-demand or pulse flow, delivery is measured by the size (in milliliters) of the \\"bolus\\" of oxygen per breath.  Some uses  Medical: :Allows patients to utilize oxygen therapy 24/7 and reduce mortality as much 1.94 times less than for just overnight use. :A Canadian study in 1999 concluded that an OC installation compliant to the proper regulations provides a safe, reliable, cost efficient primary hospital source of oxygen. :Helps improve exercise tolerance, by allowing the user to exercise longer. :Helps increase stamina throughout day- to-day activities. :A POC is a safer option than carrying around an oxygen tank since it makes the purer gas on demand. :POC units are consistently smaller and lighter than tank-based systems and can provide a longer supply of oxygen. Commercial: :Glass blowing industry :Skin care :Non-pressurized aircraft :Nightclub oxygen bars although doctors and the FDA have expressed some concern with this. FAA approval On 13 May 2009, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) ruled that air carriers conducting passenger flights of greater capacity than 19 seats, must allow travelers with a disability to use an FAA-approved POC. The DOT rules have been adopted by many international airlines. A list of POCs approved for air travel is on the FAA website.  Nighttime use  On-demand units are not advised for patients that experience oxygen desaturation due to sleep apnea, and a CPAP mask is generally advised for them. For patients whose desaturation is due to shallow breathing, the nighttime use of POCs is a useful therapy. Especially with the advent of alarms and technology that detects a patient's slower breathing during sleep and adjusts the flow or bolus size accordingly.

Browne has been accused of corruption with regard to legislation he wrote in 2009 to give tax breaks to companies in a newly designated Neighborhood Improvement Zone in Allentown. His wife Heather was hired as a lobbyist with Harrisburg-based Pugliese Associates in 2010 and then quickly hired by multiple companies that benefited substantially from the NIZ provisions. Several beneficiaries of the NIZ have also made significant campaign contributions to Pat Browne, according to state records. Browne also pushed in 2013 to designate a City Revitalization and Improvement Zone in Bethlehem with similar tax breaks, and the same year Heather Browne was hired as a lobbyist by the biggest potential beneficiary of that fiscal arrangement. In 2019 Browne announced that he had succeeded in diverting hundreds of millions of dollars of PennDOT funding to a project that will add another interchange on a rural stretch of Route 78, though he admitted that area residents oppose it. His stated purpose in advocating for the interchange was to allow businesses to build warehouses on cheap farmland in one of the few areas of the Lehigh Valley where until then they had not proliferated.

A photonics mast replaces the mechanical, line-of-sight viewing system with digital equipment, similar to a digital camera array, and it has fewer locational and dimensional constraints than a traditional periscope. Unlike a periscope, it need not be located directly above its user, and it requires only a small pressure hull penetration for cabling. This allows the photonics mast to fit entirely within the sail of the submarine and means the control room need not be placed directly below the sail. A photonics mast operates by rising above the water in a manner similar to a telescoping car antenna and provides information through an array of sensors, such as high-definition low-light and thermographic cameras. Images and information can appear on display panels for analysis. The photonics mast can also support the navigation, electronic warfare, and communications functions of a conventional optical-periscope mast.

It is analogous to desk calendar, which is used by humans for ordering future events by date. Discrete event simulations require a future event list (FEL) structure that sorts pending events according to their time. Such simulators require a good and efficient data structure as time spent on queue management can be significant. The calendar queue (with optimum bucket size) can approach O(1) average performance.  Implementation  Theoretically, a calendar queue consists of an array of linked lists. Sometimes each index in the array is also referred to as a bucket. The bucket has specified width and its linked list holds events whose timestamp maps to that bucket. A desk calendar has 365 buckets for each day with a width of one day. Each array element contains one pointer that is the head of the corresponding linked list. If the array name is ‚Äúmonth‚Äù then month[11] is a pointer to the list of events scheduled for the 12th month of the year (the vector index starts from 0). The complete calendar thus consists of an array of 12 pointers and a collection of up to 12 linked lists. In calendar queue, enqueue (addition in a queue) and dequeue (deleting from a queue) of events in FEL is based on event time. Let the calendar queue with n buckets with w width. Then enqueue of an event with time t operates on bucket \\\\frac{t}{w} \\\\mod n . And more than two events scheduled in the bucket according to the increased timestamp. To dequeue events from the calendar queue, it keeps track of current year and day. Then it searches for the earliest event and dequeue it. It also used as circular as next year events can be saved in the bucket with the year that does not allow it to remove from the bucket before its time.  Calendar Queue Resize Operation  If the number of events in the queue is much smaller or much larger than the number of buckets, it will not function efficiently. The solution is to allow the number of buckets to correspondingly grow and shrink as the queue grows and shrinks. To simplify the resize operation, the Nb (number of buckets) in a CQ is often chosen to be the power of two, i.e., Nb=2^n;‚Üµ The number of buckets is doubled or halved each time the Ne (number of events) exceeds 2Nb or decreases below Nb/2 respectively. When Nb is resized, the new width w has to be calculated as well. The new w that is adopted will be estimated by sampling the average inter-event time gap from the first few hundred events starting at the current bucket position. Thereafter, a new Calendar queue is created and all the events in the old calendar will be recopied over.  References  * R.

Prior to Algeria‚Äô colonization in 1830, nonindustrial agriculture provided sustenance for its population of approximately 2-3 million. Domestic agriculture production included wheat, barley, citrus fruits, dates, nuts, and olives. After 1830, colonizers introduced 2200 individual farms operated by private sectors. Colonial farmers continued produce a variety of fruits, nuts, wheat, vegetables. Algeria became a large producer of wine during the late 19th century due to a crop epidemic that spread across France. Algeria's agriculture evolved after independence was achieved in 1962. The industry experienced multiple policy changes modernize and decry on food imports. Today, Algeria's agriculture industry continues to expand modern irrigation and size of cultivable land. Despite Algeria's geographical size, less than 4% of its total land area is cultivable. Prior to 1987, all cultivable land was possessed by the state. The state divided this land into sections recognized as the domains agricoles socialistes. These farms were abolished after 1987 and the state sold the cultivable land to individuals. However, the government of Algeria retains control over one third of all cultivable land.  Production  Algeria produced, in 2018: * 4.6 million tonnes of potato (17th largest producer in the world); * 3.9 million tonnes of wheat; * 2 million tons of watermelon (6th largest producer in the world); * 1.9 million tons of barley (18th largest producer in the world); * 1.4 million tons of onion (16th largest producer in the world); * 1.3 million tons of tomato (18th largest producer in the world); * 1.1 million tons of orange (14th largest producer in the world); * 1 million tons of date (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran); * 860 thousand tons of olives (6th largest producer in the world); * 651 thousand tons of pepper; * 502 thousand tons of grape; * 431 thousand tons of carrot; * 388 thousand tons of pumpkin; * 262 thousand tons of tangerine; * 242 thousand tons of apricot (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Turkey, Iran and Uzbekistan); * 207 thousand tons of cauliflower and broccoli; * 202 thousand tons of garlic; * 200 thousand tons of pear; * 193 thousand tons of cucumber; * 190 thousand tons of peach; * 186 thousand tons of pea; * 181 thousand tons of aubergine; * 124 thousand tons of artichoke (5th largest producer in the world, losing only to Italy, Egypt, Spain and Peru); * 118 thousand tons of oats; * 111 thousand tons of plum (20th largest producer in the world); * 109 thousand tons of fig (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Turkey, Egypt and Morocco); In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products. Algeria production in 2018, by FAO  Agriculture prior to colonialism  Prior to the colonial period, Algerian agriculture produced fruits, nuts, and vegetables using nonindustrial methods. Most of Algeria's agriculture is produced in the east on the plains around Bejaii and Annaba. Agriculture workers sustained Algeria's population of two to three million people without importing high quantities of food. However, following Algeria's population surge during and after the colonial period, Algeria imported high quantities of wheat, dairy, and meat.  Agriculture during colonialism  Algeria's agriculture system was not profitable for France during the colonial period, except during the vineyard epidemic of the 1880s. This lack of profit is marked by the Bank of Algeria's refusal to offer credit to industrial farms in Algeria. During this period, however, Algeria continued to produce fruits, vegetables, wine, and animals to sustain its population. However, during the epidemic, Algeria became a major producer of wine. During the colonial period, Algeria was transformed into ‚Äúan enormous vineyard‚Äù. Vineyards were limited during the early stages of colonialism. Farmers often only grew vineyards for personal and social consumption near their other crops. France's prolific metropolitan gardens did not necessitate wine imports from its North African colonies. However, Algeria's role in wine production transformed during the late nineteenth century. Phylloxera gripped vineyards across France and sparked an agricultural epidemic. This epidemic struck France at an inopportune time as it was evolving into a world leader for wine exports. France's economy plummeted and the agricultural sector began searching for opportunities. The French government incentive farmers in Algeria to produce wine to combat the epidemic that was spreading across French vineyards. Algerian Agriculture workers began expanding their vineyards across the country. Large quantities of wine flowed from Algeria to France and to other countries across the world. Algeria developed a reputation for growing high quality and extensive types of wine. However, Algeria's role as a leader in wine production was short lived. France's vineyards recovered in the following decades and it lessened its reliance on Algerian wine exports.  Agriculture post colonialism  After independence was achieved in 1962 colonial farms were replaced by laborers. 2200 farms operated by colonizers were now operated by work laborers who had previously worked on the farms. The term autogestion was used to describe that the farms were self managed. Wage laborers continued to follow the farming practices used by the French, which includes the use of farming machines and chemical enhancers. Following the model established by the French permitted Algerian farmers to export their products to international markets. However, these private farms yielded lower quantities of produce due to the unstable government and lack of workers. After Algeria achieved independence, the French government assured Algerian farmers they would purchase reserves of its wine and other produce. However, France's agriculture sector pressured the government to source wine internally and rescind contracts with Algeria. Cancelled contracts created an oversupply of wine in Algeria. The Soviet Union purchased high quantities of wine from Algeria in the 1970s, but this did not alleviate Algeria's oversupply of wine. This period consisted of private corporation and individuals owning and operating farms in Algeria. Algeria's model was an extension of the previous French model, although the French farmers were replaced by Algerians companies and Algerian citizens, including peasants who tilled the land during the colonial regime. Although individuals had access to purchase and operate farms, private companies owned the majority of farms. Inequitable distribution of farms in Algeria inspired an agriculture revolution.  Post agrarian revolution and contemporary efforts  Disenchanted the Algeria's low production yield and large dependency on international imports for food, the government launched an agriculture revitalization program at the beginning of the 1980. The government recognized that the previous model introduced during the agrarian revolution was unsuccessful and harmful to the agriculture industry. Algeria's Ministry of Agriculture withdrew socialist control of the agriculture industry and reintroduced the private sector into the agriculture industry. New policy allowed private corporations to purchase farmable land and introduce independent techniques. This change marked a shift from a socialist program to a market place strategy. From 1987-1999, the ministry of agriculture continued to lessen the state's control over the agriculture industry. The state maintained approximately one third control of cultivable land in Algeria, however it continued to allow the private sector to invest and take control over the industry. This is marked by the private sector's ability to purchase farming resources independently and hire workers ot their own liking. In addition the government allowed private companies to develop their own contracts with farming networks. This resulted in an expansion of the industry and increase in quality production. Further steps to develop the agriculture sector includes investments from the public sector increasing from 10% to 15%. The government also pledged in the 1990s to expand modern irrigation to 20 000 hectares of land. Reliance on rainwater was detrimental to the industry's success; Algeria's inconsistent crop yield and quality dissuaded countries to sign contracts with Algerian farmers. Modern irrigation systems allow the agriculture industry to develop stable relationships with foreign trade networks. Previously the Algerian government was unable to secure stable relationships with international partners because of their inability to produce consistent levels and qualities of product. But a change was occurring, and Algeria was showing the agriculture industry that it was just as deserving to have contracts as other countries. Algeria acted on its need to modernize its agriculture industry to compete with other countries. Changes have had positive impacts on both Algeria's economy and Algeria's ability to provide food to its population. Prior to reform in the agricultural sector, Algeria's ministry of agriculture was unable to provide locally grown food for its population. Algeria imported 85% of its food from other countries, marking it as one of the largest food importers in the world. However, following the government's investment in agriculture, Algeria has substantially decreased its reliance on imported of food. Algeria produces 100% of its domestic consumption of potatoes, tomatoes, and meat. Employment numbers in the agriculture sector have increased by 120% from 2000-2004. Employment in agriculture in comparison with Algeria's total labor force steadily declined after independence was achieved. In the 1970s, 64% of the total labor force worked in agriculture. As of 2000, this number has declined to 24%. Decline in agriculture is largely attributed to Algeria's reliance on imported food after the end of A Berber shepherd in Kabylia. Selling pumpkins on a market Agriculture in Algeria contributes about 12% of Algeria's gross domestic product while employing 20% of the rural population in all aspects of raising crops on 8.5 million hectares of arable land. Most of Algeria is arid desert (the Sahara) and semi-arid lands, with low and unreliable rainfall, and few crops can be grown here. The Atlas Mountain ranges in the north separate the Sahara and high desert from the Mediterranean coast, and most crops are grown on lands in the foothills and along the coast. Therefore, most arable land, only 3.5% of the total surface of Algeria, is under a Mediterranean climate, where droughts are common and rainfall is unevenly and unreliably distributed throughout the year. Algerian agriculture depends mostly upon rainfall rather than irrigation, and irrigation projects are often of limited scope. The most common crops are cereals (wheat, oat, and barley) and pulses. The most commonly raised livestock are sheep and goat, then cattle. Chickens are common in rural areas. Algeria is a net importer of food. Large quantities of crin vegetal (vegetable horse-hair), an excellent fibre, are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm. The olive, both for its fruit and oil, and tobacco are cultivated with great success. Algeria also exports figs, dates, esparto grass and cork. It is the largest oat market in Africa. Wine production Throughout arable lands in Algeria the soil favours the growth of vines. The country, in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the French government, \\"can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste\\". The growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists, but it was not until vineyards in France were attacked by phylloxera that the export of wine from Algeria became significant. In 1883, despite precautionary measures, Algerian vineyards were also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved. In 1850, less than 2,000 acres (8 km¬≤) were devoted to the grape, but in 1878, this had increased to over 42,000 acres (170 km¬≤), which yielded 7,436,000 gallons (28,000 m¬≥) of wine. Despite bad seasons and ravages of insects, cultivation extended, and in 1895, the vineyards covered 300,000 acres (1,200 km¬≤), the produce being 88,000,000 gallons (333,000 m¬≥). The area of cultivation in 1905 exceeded 400,000 acres (1,600 km¬≤), and in that year the amount of wine produced was 157,000,000 gallons (594,000 m¬≥). By that time the limits of profitable production had been reached in many parts of the country. Practically the only foreign market for Algerian wine is France, which in 1905 imported about 110,000,000 gallons (416,000 m¬≥). The Algerian body responsible for wine cultivation is called the National Office of Marketing of Wine Products (ONCV).

Agriculture contributes around 35% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and 80% of export income. While the Government of Benin (GOB) aims to diversify its agricultural production, Benin remains underdeveloped, and its economy is underpinned by subsistence agriculture. Approximately 93% of total agricultural production goes into food production. The proportion of the population living in poverty is about 35.2%, with more rural households in poverty (38.4%) than urban households (29.8%). 36% of households depend solely upon agricultural (crop) production for income, and another 30% depend on crop production, livestock, or fishing for income. Cotton is the principal cash crop and accounts for 70% of export earnings. Cotton is mostly exported as bales with only 3% of total production processed locally, making the country heavily dependent on world cotton prices. Cashews, shea nuts and shea butter, pineapples, palm products, and some cocoa and coffee also are export crops. Animal and meat exports to nearby countries contribute a significant amount to the agricultural economy, but remains mostly outside official recorded statistics. Corn, beans, rice, peanuta, cashews, pineapples, cassava, yams, other tubers, and vegetables and fruits are grown for local subsistence and for export to neighboring countries through informal cross-border trading activities. Top commodities produced by quantity are cassava, yams, corn, pineapples, tomatoes, rice, cottonseed, cashew nuts, fresh fruit, and groundnuts. Top commodities produced by value are yams, cassava, cotton lint, cashew nuts, pineapples, corn, tomatoes, cattle, hot peppers, and rice. Since 2008 the GOB has been actively involved in strengthening agricultural development and the staple crop value chains. Benin is a party to commitments made by the heads of government at the various world summits on food and nutrition, including the Millennium Summit. As of 2014, improving agricultural productivity and strengthening diversification were on the top of President Boni Yayi's agenda for agricultural development and overall poverty reduction strategy. The country's long-term vision is to move towards greater diversification in order to become a major exporter of agricultural products by 2025. To start, the GOB has focused on corn and rice to promote food security and food self-sufficiency. Coarse grains (corn, sorghum, millet) and rice are mostly grown by independent small-scale farmers, who are responsible for producing 90% of the total output while using between 7% and 10% of the total arable land available. Many of the farmers that grow cotton or corn do so on only , with the largest single farm only reaching up to of land. Current national actions are still very weak, and national plans for food security are mostly focused on staple food (calories) production and addressing nutrient deficiencies by supplementation (vitamin A & iron), food fortification, and salt iodization. While the GOB aims to diversify its agricultural production, Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent upon the world price for cotton and regional trade. Agriculture policy is set and implemented or influenced by a number of ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Breeding, and Fishing (Minist√®re de l'Agriculture, de l'Elevage, et de la P√™che), Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Economy and Finances, and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. Extension services are provided at the Department level through the CerPA (Regional Center for Agriculture Promotion, Centre R√©gional pour la Promotion Agricole). Research is carried out at the National Institute of Agriculture Research (Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du B√©nin; INRAB) and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Partners working with the GOB to improve the agricultural sector include the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), SNV Benin, the European Union, the Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ), French Development Agency (AFD), and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and initiatives. Production Benin produced in 2018: * 3.8 million tons of cassava (17th largest producer in the world); * 2.7 million tons of yam (4th largest producer in the world, losing only to Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast); * 1.5 million tons of maize; * 758 thousand tons of cotton (12th largest producer in the world); * 598 thousand tons of palm oil; * 459 thousand tons of rice; * 372 thousand tons of pineapple; * 319 thousand tons of sorghum; * 253 thousand tons of tomato; * 225 thousand tons of peanut; * 221 thousand tons of soy; * 215 thousand tons of cashew nuts (5th largest producer in the world, losing only to Vietnam, India, Ivory Coast and Philippines); In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like sheanut (13 thousand tons), orange (15 thousand tons) and coconut (17 thousand tons). Benin production in 2018, by FAO Food security Benin is one of Africa's most stable democracies but the country is challenged by multiple economic and development factors, and the country ranks 163 out of 189 countries on the 2019 Human Development Index. Economic growth is largely dependent upon agriculture, and fluctuations in the volume of rainfall, the high cost of agricultural inputs, and the low level of mechanization impact the country's food security. The World Food Program reviewed Benin's situation in 2014 and determined that 23% of households in Benin have limited food security and another 11% suffer severe to moderately bad food insecurity. Only 55% are considered food secure. Among the departments Couffo, Mono, and Atacora are the most food insecure departments, with 29%, 28%, and 25% of their households, respectively, considered food insecure. Within these departments there are pockets where food insecurity is experienced by 35-40% of all households. These same three departments also lead in the percentage of households experiencing the slightly improved situation of limited food security, Mono 49%, Atacora 48%, Couffo 47%, Borgou 34%, Collines 27%, and Donga 25%. Of these departments, Atacora, Donga, and Mono suffer the weakest diversity of diet. This is a seasonal problem in many locations, exacerbated by a lack of income. Anecdotal discussions with Peace Corps volunteers stationed in the Peonga area in Oueme Department indicated that absolute food scarcity is not a common problem, but that the lack of diversity in diets, especially during the hungry seasons just before harvests, brought a lack of micronutrients and insufficient nutritional benefits from the available foods. Heavy reliance upon staple crops for starches was common as well, with sauces important to the daily diet, vegetables, vegetable oils, and sugar next in importance, and animal proteins less a common ingredient in the daily meals. Most food insecure households consume primarily cereals and tubers, with legumes and vegetable oil. Slightly better off households introduce animal proteins and sugar into their diets when they can afford to do so. There are varying levels of household wealth among the departments, here listed from wealthiest to poorest: Littoral, Ou√©m√©, Atlantique, Mono, Zou, Plateau, Donga, Collines, Borgou, Couffo, Alibori, Atacora. More than 85% of households obtain most of their food in local markets, as opposed to being self-sufficient. Most of these households grow crops for consumption, but rely upon the market for diversity and during the famine times. Regional and international agribusiness and trade Border crossing between Benin and Niger Benin serves as a delivery corridor for West Africa reaching more than 100 million people in the landlocked countries of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, and the northern states of Nigeria. Goods landed in Cotonou get placed on trucks first heading north to the border towns of Malanville in Benin and Gaya in Niger and then onto the rest of the Sahel. Parakou is the major crossroad town in Benin, where goods going west to Togo, Ghana, and Burkina Faso pass, and goods going into Nigeria transit before heading to various border crossings. The S√®m√®/Krak√© border crossing with Nigeria along the coastal road is a major trade nexus for many of the agricultural products imported into Benin. Benin's traditional trade links with the European Union, in particular France and Belgium, remain strong. There is presence of Chinese foodstuffs in the open-air markets and supermarkets. Benin's major trade partners include Nigeria, France, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Argentina, Brazil, the United States, China, and the United Arab Emirates. The major regional trading partners include Niger, Togo, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. Estimates of annual trade with these countries are extremely hard to determine, but some sources indicate that as of 2014 Benin exported about 15,000 tons of corn and 1,500 tons of rice to Nigeria, 6,000 tons of corn to Niger, 1,400 tons of corn and 2,000 tons of rice to Togo. Vegetables and animals move across these borders in large amounts in regular patterns. In ‚Äúcrisis years‚Äù where local crops are underproduced, Benin has sourced as much as 9,500 tons of corn and 950 tons of rice from Togo, and 6,000 tons of rice and 1,800 tons of corn from Nigeria. Nigeria's 170 million people and the country's income from oil also influence the economy of Benin significantly. Informal trade between Nigeria and Benin is substantial. Importers take advantage of Nigeria's high tariff changes and porous borders to export unrecorded rice, poultry products and other food and agricultural products to Nigeria. Trade sources estimate that more than 85% of these types of products that are shipped to Benin are meant for onward sales into Nigeria through informal cross-border trading activities. While Nigerian brokers can travel up to farms in Benin to buy vegetables, local buyers often transport their fruits, mostly pineapple and oranges, to markets on the Benin-Nigeria border. The S√®m√®/Krak√© border market is the best known market of the country for pineapple and orange transactions, where Nigerian brokers load up vehicles bound for Nigeria. This border crossing is also where the majority of other imported agricultural products leave Benin for Nigeria, including palm oil, rice, refined sugar, and poultry meat. According to border-based sources, Kalal√®, Caldel, and Onazal in Benin are the three major border towns for the routes of cross-border trade with Nigeria. However, women carrying baskets filled with yams and other items regularly pass over the border at Chikandou in central Benin heading to the Nigerian town of Tchikanda. Production =Commercial crops= Cotton Transportation of cotton in Benin Cotton accounted for nearly 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts as of 2014, and so cotton exports are vital to Benin's economy and an integral part of the country's development plans and poverty reduction strategies. Cotton seed production is concentrated in the north and center of Benin in an area known as the cotton belt. About two thirds of the farmers of Borgou department grow cotton, 37% of those in Atacora department and 64% of those in the central department of Zou. By contrast, in the three departments in the south (Atlantique, Mono, and Ou√©m√©), the percentage ranges from zero to 25%. Cotton is grown by small-scale farmers and sold to ginning companies, which transform it into cotton lint and/or produce other by products such as cotton seed, cake, and oil. After rising to become one of the 20 leading global producers of cotton lint between 2004 and 2006, Benin experienced a sharp fall in production and exports in the early to mid-2000s. For example, 2010/2011 production was less than one third of the installed ginning capacity of 620,000 tons. Likewise, production of cotton lint was less than half of the level recorded in 2004/2005. Cotton production forecasts are often missed because of unpredictable weather (rains). Until June 2012, the Association Interprofessionel du Cotton (AIC) was responsible for coordinating marketing of inputs and seed cotton, facilitating financial and economic claims among the key stakeholders, and was the main importer and distributor of cotton insecticides. However, in mid-2013 the GOB removed AIC from its critical role and established a new sector framework, Cadre Institutionnel Transitoire de Gestion de la Filiere Cotton, to set guidelines for a new management framework to revive the cotton industry, including defining new terms for public-private partnerships. The GOB's attempt to revitalize the cotton sector included making sure that producers/farmers are fully paid for the previous year's crop, consolidating farmer's organizations, creating village cooperatives, providing capacity building to small producers, and fortifying input committees. The GOB also inserted itself into the processing of cotton fibers, by paying ginners a fixed fee of 50 CFA per kilogram for processing (ginners wanted twice that amount‚Äîthey previously handled all exports), and took over the export of cotton and cotton seeds. This disrupted normal practices within the ginning industry. Benin's production recovered in the late 2010s, with Benin leading West Africa's franc zone in cotton production in the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 seasons. Shea tree in northwest Benin Shea Shea nuts (karit√©) are collected from native, uncultivated trees in the Sahel band of Benin by individuals who either sell the nuts to wholesalers, or produce shea butter for export or for use in local foods (cooking oil) or in the making of skin ointments or soaps for local consumption. A number of women's cooperatives have become involved in shea butter. Shea butter is a substitute for cocoa butter and remains highly sought after on the world market for confectionary or cosmetic use. Shea trees grow widely across West Africa. They only begin to bear fruit after 20 years of growth, do not reach maturity for 45 years, and can produce nuts for up to 200 years after reaching maturity. The long time before nut production has made them unattractive for commercialization. In some areas the trees are shades trees for other crops in certain dry areas. The shea nuts are surrounded by a soft fruit and fall to the ground June through August. The collected nuts are buried in pits which cause the pulp to ferment and disintegrate, and the heat produced prevents germination. The nuts are then dried, shelled, and winnowed, usually by hand. The kernels are dried further to reduce moisture content from about 40% to about 7%. Benin is the world's sixth largest producer of shea nuts and has two processing plants. Sinocog Bohicon is the larger of the two, with a 10,000-ton capacity that usually works at 25% utilization per year. The second plant is Sonicog Cononou, with 5,000 tons of processing capacity, usually reaching 20% utilization per year. Benin is estimated to produce (collect) about 50,000 tons of shea nuts a year, exports about 35,000 tons of nuts per year, and produces a small amount of shea butter for exports, about 100 tons. Cashew nuts Cashew fruits in Pob√® Benin's cashew nuts are considered to be the second best in West Africa, after Guinea-Bissau's. The late 1990s saw international demand for cashews increase and stimulate interest in increasing production in Benin. Cashew plantations grew from about in 1990 to more than in 2008, according to FAOSTAT data. Some 200,000 growers raise the crops on plots averaging between , with growers averaging 1.5 plots each. The largest plots are between , with very few reaching up to in size. Cashews can be grown all over the country, but the lower third of the country (from Ketou up to Gougounou), not including the littoral area, is the optimal production area. Production in 2008 was estimated at about 98,938 tons. Exports from Benin reached 116,398 tons in 2008, 15% of which included cashew nuts from other countries, such as Nigeria, Togo, and Burkina Faso‚Äîall much smaller producers. Cashew nut exports represent about 8% of total export value, 7% of agricultural GDP, and 3% of the national GDP in 2008. The farm gate price in 2008 averaged $500.00 per ton, with each farmer producing about ¬Ω ton annually. Very few inputs are used, with some pesticides and fertilizer specific for cotton used when diverted. In the mid-2000s, the non-governmental organization TechnoServe pursued a public-private partnership to establish a processing plant, Afokantan Benin, located south of Parakou, as a joint venture between a Beninese entrepreneur and the leading Dutch cashew kernel broker Global Trading, with support from the Dutch Government Private Sector Investment Programme and the African Cashew Alliance. This factory has a capacity of 1,500‚Äì2,000 tons per year and is the only facility processing at any scale. It produces white kernels which go onto the Netherlands. There are a few other smaller commercial operations, but none operating with substantial impact on the market. Artisanal producers are also active as well, producing for the domestic market and some exports to Nigeria and Togo. Raw nuts are exported to mostly India (70% of total production), with Vietnam, Pakistan, and Singapore (25% shared between them) next, followed by Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, and Indonesia. Only 5% remains for local processing or nearby informal trade to Nigeria and Togo of locally processed/packaged cashews. The cashew apples, the fleshy part above the nut, with an estimated production of 600,000 tons per year, go unutilized and could be used to make juice, jam, alcohol or biofuels. Within Benin domestic consumption of the nuts is concentrated to celebratory occasions (weekends, parties, holidays) or for use as traveling gifts. Palm grove in Abomey-Calavi Palm oil Oil palm has been an important crop in Benin since the 19th century, when palm groves were established to meet the oil demand for soaps in the Western world. Oil palms are indigenous to West Africa, naturally occurring in swampy areas. The many products from the plants (fibers, oils, sap) have been used for centuries by local populations. Commercial usage focuses upon the oil from the meat surrounding the kernels (palm oil), and the oil within the kernel (palm kernel oil). Estimates on the size of the palm plantations at the historical peak in the 1930s put them covering . Processing in those days was by hand, with women primarily serving as small-scale producers and processors. Benin undertook an oil palm industrialization program in the 1950s and began to invest in large- scale, public, industrial processing facilities. With independence in 1960, the national government increased the effort and focused on improving productivity by planting around of selected oil palm seedlings between 1960 and 1974. Challenges came: rainfall decreased and management problems rose, while external competition from Asian countries pressured profitability, leading the government to back away from the industrialized palm oil sector. The problems hit the small-holder producers as well and the peak number of palm groves dropped from to an estimated by 2000. Current estimates put the land under cultivation at between , mostly in Ou√©m√©, Plateau, Atlantic, Mono, Couffo, and Zou Districts. The industry's troubles continued during the 1960s and 1970s with the manner in which the government approached the industry; some farmers had their plantations expropriated by the government and were to be compensated with annual rent payments. Farmer unhappiness with the low rents led to the destruction of or more of oil palm plantations in the early 1990s in protest. In response the government tripled rent payments and began an oil palm seedling distribution program in 1993 (private nurseries were subsidized to sell seedlings), and made efforts to privatize the large processing facilities and offer support to private sector processors for equipment purchases. Recent efforts by the Government to revitalize the agriculture sector have included a focus on exploring biofuel production, and oil palm improvements are at the center of this effort. Groups from Malaysia, South Africa, and China have visited Benin to examine the possibilities of investing in the business. Annual palm oil production has grown from 31,000 tons in 1961 to 50,000 tons in 2013, averaging about 5% growth per year. =Commercial processing= Benin possesses limited agricultural processing facilities of any scale. There are a number of cotton gins, an edible oil (cottonseed) processing plant, some smaller palm oil facilities, a sugar refinery, and some juice processors. Cottage-level processing of a number of agricultural products is widespread, but limited to village-level production capacity in all but a few cases. Some cooperatives are engaged in shea processing to make shea butter and locally used shea products, especially soaps and skin ointments. This work is important for a number of women's groups and cooperatives, and shea butter has become a more important export crop for Benin. The Fludor cottonseed plant began operations in 1996 but, as cottonseed supplies have diminished, switched to processing soybean oil and shea butter. Owned by a German expatriate, it is managed by Indian nationals and sells cottonseed cake and soybean powder and husks for animal feed. The SUCOBE sugar refinery is near Save in Collines Department, next to a cane plantation and a man-made reservoir supplying irrigation. It is a joint project between the governments of Benin and Nigeria. A Chinese company operates it under a lease agreement. As of 2014, there were only three small- scaled, under-developed fruit processing units in Benin. One of them, IRA (Initiative pour la Relance de l'Ananas), is located in the country pineapple belt of Allada and produces only pineapple juice. IRA is a cooperative made up of groups of pineapple farmers in Benin. In 2009, the group was able to access funding through the Millennium Challenge compact of U.S. $200,000 to purchase modern processing equipment and as of 2014 processed about 80 tons a day of pineapple into canned juice. The other fruit processors have rudimentary pineapple processing units and utilize (re-use) disposable bottles for their juice packaging. The GOB has set up four vegetable and fruit processing units to process tomatoes, oranges, pineapple, and mangoes to add value to these crops and reduce post-harvest losses. =General agricultural cultivation and production practices= Benin has a large percentage of land that can be considered grassland cover, over 90%, which is the highest percentage of grassland cover in sub-Saharan Africa. Benin's land utilization breaks down into the following components: 25% () is in forested zones, 23.5% () is arable land that is now used for agriculture or could be, 8% () is already in permanent crop production, some 4% () is used as permanent pasture for grazing livestock, and the remainder of 39.4% () is in other uses (urban areas, coastal, roads, etc.). Land utilization crosses categories, with crop stubble feeding ruminants, and grazing taking place in afforested areas. Livestock is an important component of agricultural production, contributing about 6% of GDP from the husbandry of cattle, goats and sheep, pigs, poultry, grasscutters (greater cane rats), and snails. Approximately 36% of Benin households engage in some form of raising livestock, and it is particularly important for the North. Around 87% of households in Alibori Department and 41% of households in Borgou Department depend upon livestock as their main economic activity, and it is very important as an economic livelihood in Donga, Mono, and Zou Departments as well. In 2004, there were approximately 1.8 million cattle, 2.3 million goats & sheep, 293,000 pigs, and 13.2 chickens in Benin. Capture fisheries (sea and fresh water) production provides work for 70,000 people and produces 2% of GDP, reaching an estimated high of 40,000 tons harvested in 2005. On average, Benin farmers cultivate plots in size, with 85% of farmers growing corn, 30% cassava, 31% yams, and 30% sorghum. Only 11% grow cotton, the principal cash crop for the country. The largest plots of farmland are found in Borgou, followed by Atacora, Collines, Alibori, Donga, Plateau, Ou√©m√©, Atlantique, Mono, and Couffo in that order. The leading departments with the highest percentage of households engaged in crops or gardens for food production and income are as follows: Atacora 80%, Alibori 70%, Donga 60%, Collines 54%, Borgou 53%, Couffo 44%, Plateau 40%, and Zou 37%. A report undertaken by the Council of Private Investors in Benin in 2007 divided the country into eight agricultural zones in regards to crop cultivation and animal husbandry practices. The zones, working from the north to the south, are as follows: *Zone I. Area comprising Karimana, Malanville, and northern Kandi in Alibori District. Situated along the Niger River, this area has two major types of soil, susceptible to erosion. Major crops produced here include millet, sorghum, and cowpeas. Riverbed areas produce cotton, corn, rice, beans, onions, peppers, leafy vegetables, and a small amount of potatoes. This area has larger amounts of arable land and draft animals are common. The riverbed locations permit much off-season vegetable production, especially peppers and tomatoes which are usually marketed in the two large markets in Karimana and Malanville. Some of this production goes outside the local area via traders to destinations further south or in neighboring countries. *Zone II. Area of Kerou, northeast Kouande in Atacora and Banikoara, Segbana, Gougounou, and southern Kandi, all in Alibori District. Soils here are subject to erosion and major rainfall season is once annually. Cotton is important here, with corn, peanuts, sorghum, yam, and cassava also in production. Shea and cashew nuts are found here as well. *Zone III. Area of Southern Borgou to Donga, including Pehunco, Parakou, N'Dali, Perere, Nikki, Dinende, Kalade, and Bembereke. Soil fertility is variable here with leaching as the leading soil issue. Annual rainfall in one period mostly. Shea trees are important here. Crops are primarily sorghum, yams, cotton and corn intercropped. Additional crops include cassava, peanuts, rice and legumes where there is more water. Animal husbandry is important to this area. *Zone IV. Area of Ouake, Copargo, Boukoumbe, Tanguieta, Materi, Natitingou, Toukountouna, Kouande, Cobly, and West Djougou where rainfall is irregular and fluctuates in volume. Predominantly a dry, savannah area with generally infertile soils, except in the permanently moist areas along watercourses. Crops include millet, sorghum, black fonio, bambara groundnuts, cowpeas, and peanuts. Moist areas can sustain cocoyam, water yams, sweet potatoes, rice, and assorted vegetables commercially important during the off-season. *Zone V. This area is composed of Atacora, Borgou, Mono, and Ou√©m√© to Zou. The Bassila area in Atacora has large amounts of virgin (uncultivated) land. Area has higher rainfall. The main crops include yams, corn, cassava, peanuts, rice, citrus, and cashew nuts. Shea, almonds, African Locust beans (Parkia nuts), and peppers are also produced. Annuals and fruit crops can do well in this area. *Zone VI. Area of Plateau, Atlantique, Mono, Couffo, and Ou√©m√© to Zou. It rains here twice annually, on a heavily degraded hardpan soil that is easy to cultivate. Leading crops are corn, peanuts, cowpeas, cassava, peppers, coffee, mangos, citrus, bananas, legumes, and oil palms. Breeding of ruminants (cattle, goats, sheep) is important here, along with poultry and fisheries. Some private irrigation efforts during the off-season produce legumes and rice. *Zone VII. An area comprising Atlantique, Mono, Ou√©m√©, and Zou. Rainfalls twice a year, on a fertile soil with a high clay content that makes it harder to work. Corn is the major crop, followed by cowpeas, vegetables, and rice. Here poultry and smallholder livestock husbandry is important economically. *Zone VIII. Area of Atlantique, Littoral, Mono, Ou√©m√©. Rain falls twice a year, on very fertile alluvial soils in some areas and on poor sandy soils. Corn is the lead staple crop, cowpeas and vegetables next in importance economically. Corn and cassava are grown in the sandy soil. Arable land is limited in this area due to the major cities being located within it. =Livestock= Cattle in Lokoli Cattle, goats and sheep are the primary animals raised in Benin, most found on the northern grasslands. Pasturage for cattle, goats and sheep is whatever natural plant growth occurs in the area, supplemented by crop residues when these are available. Sheep are often tethered while grazing and goats are left to forage on their own. Very few individuals provide cut fodders or concentrated animal feed for their animals. Benin has numerous grasses suitable for grazing ruminants, but during the dry season can experience shortages in areas of suitable plants, or the available plants provide low nutrition. This is the primary reason for the seasonal migration patterns of most animals. Poultry and pigs are also important economically, but there are very few large operators and most production is at the household level. Grasscutters, rabbits, and African snails round out the livestock assortment. Cattle There is no predominant breed of cattle in the country, with is a constant mixing of the herd. Breeds most common in Benin include Lagune (Dwarf West African Shorthorn), Somba (Savannah Shorthorn), Borgou (local cross between Zebu and humpless crossbred), and Zebu. Most of the cattle are raised in a seasonal migration pattern, with a small portion (20% or less) raised in a sedentary manner mostly in the southern portions of the country. Borgou, Alibori, Atacora, and Donga Districts hold most of the cattle. Fulani are the main herders, and often work for hire. Herds are moved from north to south and back, depending upon available forage and water supplies. Herds in the north can be as large as 80 or so animals. Most cattle are raised for meat, some cattle near towns produce milk for sale. A few cattle in the northeast area are raised in small herds with very limited movement (Somba farmers), and a larger group in the southern area are raised with a few animals per household, where the households are in areas demarked by waterways. Here the animals are moved around depending on availability of forage from location to location, household by household. Some villages hire herdsmen to oversee the village animals. Total herd size for the country is estimated at between 750,000 and 1 million animals.left Goats and sheep The small ruminants are generally kept by individual households, who usually hold two to five animals. These animals are raised off the land, with very few getting any kind of supplemental feeding or health treatment. The combined herd of goats and sheep is estimated to be between 1.5 to 1.8 million animals. There are two breeds of sheep, the Sahelian (larger) and the Guinean (small). The Sahelian breed predominates among the sheep in the north and reach up to live weight. Smaller sheep average in live weight. Goats are found all across the country and are usually either the African Dwarf breed (for meat) or the long-legged Sahelian goat (for milking). Meat goats range in size from , while the milking goats average closer to per animal. More goats are found in the southern part of the country than sheep, where they are more popular because there are some cultural and ethnic restrictions on raising sheep. Ownership of goats is popular among women due to the ease of care and because they are cheaper to own and present less risk compared to other livestock. Cross-border market for poultry meat Benin is a major importer of poultry meat and does not consume most of what is imported. Most goes to Nigeria. Poultry meat is scarce in Nigeria, and cost of poultry production is also high. Despite this, the Government of Nigeria (GON) maintains a ban on legal frozen poultry imports, primarily to protect local producers, whereas poultry meat is free for import in Benin. Benin's poultry sector is small, with domestic poultry meat production of about 13,000 tons in 2013, but a conservative estimate of poultry meat imports into Benin that year exceeded 160,000 tons (about 6,500 units of 40-foot containers) valued at more than US$450 million. (Some Benin importers indicated that poultry imports are actually as high as 300,000 tons annually). More than 85% of this is shipped to Benin for onward sales into Nigeria‚Äîentering the Nigerian market through informal cross-border trading activities (as do rice, intermediate and consumer-oriented food, and agricultural products of all type). Poultry meat importers in Benin want the GON to maintain Nigeria's import ban on poultry meat in order for them to continue to serve the huge and increasing Nigerian poultry meat consumers. However, some poultry meat importers in Benin also own poultry operations, mostly for egg production and some poultry meat processing and packaging. Many fish importers are also shifting to poultry meat imports using their existing cold storage facilities, and others are expanding their storage facilities particularly around the Benin-Nigeria border, to meet Nigeria's increasing demand for imported poultry products at the border. Poultry farmers produce mostly eggs for domestic consumption. For poultry meat, they are limited more by the country's market size than cost of production inputs. Although they still have easy and adequate supplies of corn, soybeans, and other feed ingredients, they fear the cost of production is rising due mainly to increasing human consumption of these products (particularly corn and soybeans). Generally, Benin's poultry farmers want the GON to remove its import ban on poultry meat in order for them to gain free access into Nigeria's massive market. One Benin farm is very integrated and stocks about 50,000 birds (chickens), produces other poultry types as well, compounds its own feeds, has its own poultry processing and packaging facilities, and supplies poultry meat to one of the country's large supermarkets. The farm also runs an aquaculture farm and owns a newly established poultry farm that has the capacity to hold over 100,000 birds. Currently, the new farm is stocking about 10,000 birds, and the firm seeks partners and markets, especially in Nigeria, to optimize its operations. Carrot field in Grand-Popo =Vegetables= Vegetables in Benin are produced in many different systems and locations, but can be generally put in two distinct categories: 1) a lowland vegetable farming system in the rural areas and 2) an urban and peri- urban production system. In lowland cultivation, traditional vegetables such as tomato, pepper, onion, okra, and leafy vegetables are the most dominant type of vegetables produced. In the urban and peri-urban vegetable production system, vegetables may be both traditional and non-traditional (exotic). With the strong economic growth in Benin, the demand for non-traditional vegetables such as cabbage, carrot, lettuce, and cucumber has increased. Plot sizes are an average of where a variety of different vegetables are grown nearby the larger cities. Vegetable production includes tomato, pepper, onion, okra across the country; and cabbage, carrot, lettuce, and cucumber growing in specific areas suitable for this type of crop. Leafy vegetables are grown year-round where there is water available. Waterways and river valley locations are prime vegetable growing sites, except during the flood season from September to December and the November to March dry season. The Cotonou area has of land allocated for peri-urban plots of vegetables, with producers working plots between each. This area has dependable ground water and produces year-round, with most of the production marketed in Cotonou or exported to Nigeria. The largest vegetable farm in Benin () is located here in this coastal area just outside of Cotonou in Grand-Popo. Vegetable production is meant for local consumption and export to neighboring countries, especially Nigeria. Import of vegetables from Burkina Faso and Niger increases during the off season between November and March. Growers sell to wholesalers or retailers by unwritten agreement and almost never sell directly to end consumers. Most production goes to local consumption or over to Nigeria. During the dry season Burkina Faso and Niger produce vegetables for sale in Benin, tomatoes in particular. upright =Fruits= According to INRAB, the best fruit species in Benin are mango, papaya, banana, orange, avocado, guava, and pineapple, considering cost and income intensity, profitability and investment comparison, and financial competitiveness. Papaya, banana, and orange contribute more to producers' income and profitability, whereas increased pineapple production participates in jobs creation. From virtual non-existence in the 1980s to 222,000 tons of production in 2009, the pineapple sector now accounts for 1.2% of Benin GDP and 4.3% of the country's agricultural GDP after cotton and cashew nuts, ahead of shea butter and palm oil. The pineapple production zones are located in south, and growers fall into two groups, small with plots of , and large with plots of . Only 2% of Benin's pineapple production is exported to European markets. Some production is processed into juices locally, and the rest of the fresh pineapple is exported to neighboring countries, particularly Nigeria. In 2009, Benin's pineapple production reached 222,000 tons. =Production constraints= Farmers in Benin face many obstacles to increasing production. They include rudimentary growing systems, limited access to land in the peri-urban production zones, difficulty in obtaining appropriate land title deed or certificate of land occupancy, a lack of adequate credit, 25% or higher post- harvest losses during peak season production, a lack of coordinated groups to aggregate benefits in marketing and distribution, an absence of appropriate packaging systems for products, and an absence of specific vegetable inputs. Producers utilize the chemical fertilizers and pesticides that are only available for cotton on many other crops, as there are few or no alternatives. Farmers also encounter soil issues: 45% report infertile soils are the greatest problem, a lack of moisture was the next greatest soil issue at 34%, degraded soils were seen as problematic by 32%, and flooding was a problem for 25% of farmers. *Inadequate input supply. A wide range of fertilizers are being used, especially for vegetable gardens. Imported artificial fertilizers, like urea and NPK, though highly esteemed, are expensive and therefore not widely used. Nitrogen fertilizer is also available as a locally produced brand and is substantially cheaper. However, some farmers cannot afford any of these products, and to enrich the soil they depended partly or wholly on household waste. Urban farmers that have access to chicken manure will use this manure because this is considered to be as effective as artificial fertilizers (high nitrogen content). Although the farmers pay for all these inputs, the costs are considerably lower than for artificial fertilizers. *Lack of land title. The lack of land titles by most smallholder farmers hinders the ability to invest in equipment such as drip irrigation, or to get access to loans. *Distrust among farmers. Farmers organized in cooperatives or farmers groups do not regularly work together for sale of their produce. There is a lack of trust among small farmers to aggregate produce and as a result farmers associations are not set up to improve for sales. They like to buy inputs together, but are not organized in selling their produce as a group. Thus, there is a lack of economies of scale to reach bigger and important markets. Aggregating of produce occurs at the traders' level as they develop long term relationships with individual farmers, where farmers are price takers. *Pests and disease management. Farmers face many challenges and have no extension services available. Although the use of chemical pesticides is fairly widespread, the amounts available are generally moderate and limited to those with access to cotton input supplies. Over time, several organic pesticides, notably extracts from the Neem tree, have been successfully introduced by a number of international NGOs. Additives such as wood ash and chicken manure have for a long time been known as repellents and are widely used. *Access to finance. There are no specific agro-loans for smallholder farmers. The lack of land title and inadequate bookkeeping practices of farmers stymies their ability to acquire loans. *Dependence on rain. Most production in Benin is primarily rain fed and in some cases manually irrigated when farms are in close proximity to major water sources. This dependence results in high seasonal availability of produce and lower prices due to an abundance of produce during the rainy season(s). Marketing Dantokpa Market Fresh (wet) markets occur in most towns and villages, usually surrounded by large numbers of small shops selling foods, consumer items, imported foods and goods, clothing, household goods, etc. With a large portion of the population producing much of their own food, particularly for starches, open markets are where the diet is rounded out with items not self-produced. For those with higher incomes, more of the food consumed is purchased at market. Most vegetables are in villages and town markets, which usually have a major day, or multiple days, where traders and retailers are active in selling perishables in particular. Fish, meats, staple starch crops, legumes, soy and milk cheeses, fruits, and vegetables are available in the market every week of the year in most places with significant variations in the quantity supplied. Staple crops are usually sold to retailers by wholesalers, who obtain them from the producers. Meat is sold by the butchers who source from the producers. The source of vegetables depends on the season. Regional trade keeps a selection of vegetables available, with price and quantity fluctuations depending on the season. Visits to markets in the Parakou and Nikki areas observed avocados from Lom√© in Togo and red onions from Niger. Eastern border markets have many Nigerian traders coming into Benin to purchase fruits and vegetables for sale in Nigeria. Most of these transactions are not captured in either of the countries' statistical records. Vegetables traders/retailers obtain their products either from the intermediary traders or directly at the farm gate if possible. For many items there are unwritten agreements that producers will sell to retailers, not directly to consumers. Intermediaries buy at the farms and transport the products directly to their various market destinations. Women dominate the role of vegetable retailers at these open markets. Vegetable producers market much of their produce in bulk at harvest time because of the highly perishable nature of their products. In general, producers conduct all of their sales immediately after harvest. The long marketing channel of vegetables in the larger peri-urban and urban areas involves several types of intermediaries, from local traders to wholesalers. Studies by INRAB have shown that producers are more inefficient in marketing than in production. There is a lack of market participation of farmers and current barriers to entry by farmers limit their access to markets. The development of supermarkets in Cotonou, the primary city of Benin, is still extremely low. Erevan is the only major supermarket/hypermarket based in Cotonou. Headquartered in France, Erevan imports 90% of products from France, either by air or sea freight depending on the commodity and level of demand. They pay extra costs to their freight forwarder to include door-to-door delivery service, since there are no third-party refrigerated transportation providers that provide that service. Erevan pays that extra cost to ensure that their product maintains European Union Standards for food safety and handling when perishable products are being transferred to their store. Some fresh products are locally procured, but this remains very limited. Food standards There is no well-defined system for the elaboration of food standards and the Codex committee is not fully functional.

His work The painter's work bears a good deal of resemblance to that of Lorenzo Monaco. His previous name is derived from the central panel of a now-dismantled triptych, depicting the Madonna and Child Enthroned, commissioned by Antonio di Domenico Giugni for the church of Santa Maria in Latera and now held at the Cleveland Museum of Art; the picture is dated to 1419. Previously, in about 1415, the same artist painted the two outer panels of a triptych of the Madonna and Child with Saints James the Greater and Less, John the Baptist, and Anthony Abbot, now in a Swiss collection. These paintings show a distinctly Gothic style and suggest that the artist was familiar with the work of Gherardo Starnina and Alvaro Pirez, combining some of their traits with an understanding of perspective that appears to have been derived from Masaccio. Between 1425 and 1427 Battista painted another triptych, this one depicting Saint Julian and given to the college of San Gimignano; it shows the influence of Masolino da Panicale.

The community is part of the Crowley Micropolitan Statistical Area. History Some people say it was given its name because it was the halfway point on the old railroad running westward from New Orleans to Houston. Midland first appeared on an Acadia Parish map as Midland Junction. During the 1870s, Frank Quebodeaux operated a horse-and-buggy ferry over Bayou Plaquemine Br√ªl√©e built of cypress logs and was hauled across the bayou by ropes. In 1896, the railroad was extended from Midland to Gueydan, Louisiana and then from Gueydan to Abbeville, Louisiana in 1902. Southern Pacific began plans to put a railroad roundhouse at Midland due to Charles H. Cowen, one of the area's most successful rice farmers, developing the town. Cowen was an Illinois native who bought of land in the Midland area in 1892, and bought another shortly after that. In 1902, he formed the Midland Development Co. and the Midland Rice Milling Co.. and on April 22 of that year, sold 156 town lots at auction. After Cowen lost a leg in a rice threshing accident and died soon after, Southern Pacific withdrew plans to place a roundhouse in Midland. Midland's first post office was opened on June 13, 1902, in the Callahan general store, with Eugene T. Callahan as postmaster. The first school at Midland was established in 1903.

It employs the vast majority of the work force and accounted for an estimated 31% of Gross Domestic Product in 2004. However, only an estimated 13% of the total land area is under annual or perennial crops. Government attempts to modernize the agricultural sector have met with some success, especially with cotton, whose export accounted for 51% of total exports in 2004. In 2004, about 85% of the 210,000 tons of cotton produced was exported. The resistance to improvement has been due mostly to the insufficient water supply and poor soil. Although total cereal production rose from 1,547,000 tons in 1990 to 3,063,000 tons in 2004, imports are needed to meet demand. In the early 1980s, local labourers constructed a 1,144-km canal to bring water for irrigation from the Black Volta to the newly constructed Sourou Dam. This work was part of a plan to establish 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) of irrigated land for smallholders and state projects. Production figures for principal subsistence crops in 2004 were sorghum, 1,481,000 tons; millet, 881,000 tons; corn, 595,000 tons; and rice, 95,000 tons. Commercial crops (with 2004 production figures) included cottonseed (315,000 tons), groundnuts (321,000 tons), cotton fiber (210,000 tons), and sesame (29,000 tons).

Afghanistan‚ÄìRussia relations () are the relations between the nations of Afghanistan and Russia.

On 28 February 1921, Afghanistan and Soviet Russia signed a Friendship Treaty. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize Afghanistan's independence following the Third Anglo- Afghan War in 1919. Following the Second World War, Afghanistan and the Soviet Union formed a friendly relationship, and the latter provided much aid and development to Afghanistan. The two countries signed a friendship treaty in 1978, and the following year the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan with Operation Storm-333. This action precipitated a negative reaction in most of the Muslim world deeming it as an invasion, and contributing to a decline in Afghanistan's prosperity and a strengthening of radical elements within the country. The Russian-backed Afghan government collapsed in 1992. However, Russo-Afghan relations have improved somewhat in the years following the conflict. Russia now has an embassy in Kabul and a consulate-general in Mazar- e-Sharif, and Afghanistan has an embassy in Moscow. Afghanistan is also one of the countries that has recognised the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014. Historical relations = Czarist Russia = Czarist Russia first established diplomatic relations with Afghanistan in 1837, at a time of strained diplomatic relations between Great Britain and Russia.The Soviet Union and the Muslim World 1917-1958, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1959 Imperial Russia desired a direct trading route with India. Initial contact with Afghanistan was viewed with suspicion by the British Empire, which suspected Russia of attempting to expand its territory into the Indian subcontinent. The Russian government opened diplomatic relations with Afghanistan. This, combined with their support of Iranian ruler Mohammad Shah Qajar's attempt to conquer Herat in 1838, resulted in the British invasion of Afghanistan during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839‚Äì42). Throughout the 19th century Russia steadily advanced across Central Asia, conquering Tashkent in 1865, Samarkand and Kokand in 1868, and Khiva in 1873. Britain suggested Afghanistan as a buffer state, but following the June 1878 Congress of Berlin Russia sent a diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, attempted to keep the Russian envoys out, but they arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878. On 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission as well. This incident resulted in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The Panjdeh incident in 1885 was the next major event in the history of Afghan-Russian relations. Once again, the British-Russian rivalry boiled over after Russia seized several oases from Afghanistan. The British threatened war, but the nations made an agreement in 1887 establishing a buffer zone in Central Asia.Raymond Mohl, \\"Confrontation in Central Asia\\" History Today 19 (1969) 176-183 The 1916 anti-Russian rioting in Turkistan led to the Basmachi movement, which received some support from the Afghan government. The Basmachi rebels used parts of Afghanistan as a safe haven until the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, when Vladimir Lenin and other communist party leaders made efforts to gain support from the considerable Muslim population of their country. In the wake of World War I, the Bolsheviks were occupied with the Russian Civil War and other domestic issues, so Russia was less threatening compared to British imperialism. In 1919, war broke out for the third time in the Third Anglo-Afghan war with an Afghan invasion. Soviet Russia indirectly supported Afghanistan during the war by becoming the first country to establish diplomatic relations with them in 1919, and recognizing their borders.Amin Saikal, Ravan Farhadi, Kirill Nourzhanov. Modern Afghanistan: a history of struggle and survival. I.B.Tauris, 2006. , . p. 64 A British attempt to assassinate the Afghan premier, Amanullah Khan, in June 1920 led to Afghanistan quickly signing a draft of an Afghan-Soviet nonaggression pact which was formalized in 1921. The treaty provided for Afghan transit rights through the Soviet Union and formed the basis of friendly relations during the 1920s. Early Soviet assistance included financial aid, aircraft and attendant technical personnel, and telegraph operators. In 1929, Ghulam Nabi served as Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, being stationed in Moscow. =The USSR= In 1924 and 1925, The Soviet Union and Afghanistan engaged in a conflict over the island of Urtatagai. The conflict ended with a peace treaty wherein the Soviet Union recognized the island as part of Afghanistan, and Afghanistan was forced to restrain Basmachi border raids. In 1929, during the Afghan Civil War (1928‚Äì1929), the Saqqawists revoked the treaty upon coming to power. Subsequent Basmachi incursions from northern Afghanistan prompted the beginning of the Red army intervention in Afghanistan, which succeeded at reducing Basmachi offensive capabilities.Ritter, William S (1990). \\"Revolt in the Mountains: Fuzail Maksum and the Occupation of Garm, Spring 1929\\". Journal of Contemporary History 25: 547. . A small Basmachi resurgence in late 1929 and early 1930 prompted a second intervention. A group of Afghan and Soviet people in Moscow, c. 1991. A 1969 Soviet postage stamp in honor of 50 years of USSR-Afghanistan relations The Cold War lasted from 1945 to 1992. The conflict shaped Russian foreign policy towards developing countries, emphasizing the creation of puppet, proxy, and buffer states. Afghanistan's foreign policy after 1919 was one of non-alignment. Despite this policy, the Afghanistan government still retained good terms with both the United States and the Soviet Union. The countries' treaty of neutrality and nonaggression was first signed in 1928. In a confidential report in 1944 to the India Office, It was reported that fear of Russia was prevalent within the Afghan air force, and a question that was frequently put to British Instructors was \\"when will the British and Americans realise that Russia is a danger to all small countries in Europe and Asia and begin to take action to counter Russian aims in the Balkans, the Mediteranean and the Near East?\\". Upon being elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Daoud Khan pursued close relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviets began a major economic assistance program in Afghanistan in the 1950s. Afghanistan's strained relations with Pakistan over the Pashtunistan issue, as well as the 1954 military pact between Pakistan and the United States, was another large reason of the closer relations (but whilst maintaining non-alignment). Between 1954 and 1978, Afghanistan received more than $1 billion in Soviet aid, including substantial military assistance. From 1956, a major arms agreement with the USSR allowed Afghanistan to modernize their army for the first time since World War II. The Afghan king along with the Foreign Minister paid a visit to the Soviet Union in July 1957 and again from 17 August to 4 September 1957. Along with increasing military aid, it was agreed for the Soviets to conduct petroleum exploration in northern Afghanistan. An additional deal of economic and technical cooperation between the two countries was signed by Daoud Khan and Nikita Khrushchev in May 1959. The USSR also saw its neighbor as important to its national security. In 1973, the two countries announced a $200 million assistance agreement on gas and oil development, trade, transport, irrigation, and factory construction. Despite his earlier close cooperation with the USSR, Daoud Khan led Afghanistan back towards independence and non-alignment as President of the new republic. Additionally, he sent troops as well as diplomats to neighbouring countries to build up foreign relations and decrease Afghanistan's dependence on the Soviet Union, seeking instead closer relations to the west and the United States. On a state visit to the USSR in April 1977, Daoud Khan told Leonid Brezhnev that Afghanistan shall remain free and that the Soviet Union will not be able to dictate how Afghanistan would govern. Relations between the two countries turned more positive again after the communist party took power in Afghanistan. On 5 December 1978, the two countries signed a 20-year friendship treaty. However relations turned sour again after the killing of Nur Muhammad Taraki in 1979. There were four main motivations for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. First, the Soviet belief that Afghanistan had strategic importance for the security of their borders. This belief was consistent with longstanding Russian foreign policy that emphasized security through expansionism and the establishment of physical barriers in the form of buffer states. The second reason for invasion was the possibility of interrupting Chinese and American efforts to establish greater political influence in Afghanistan before Soviet intervention would entail direct confrontation of those two rival powers. The third reason was to enforce the dominance of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist revolutionary ideals, above the emergent Nationalist Islamic ideology in Afghanistan. Lastly, the Soviets were aware of the imperial advantages of direct intervention and occupation. In particular, they were interested in securing unfettered access to the raw materials and inexpensive manufactured goods of their smaller neighbour. Around this time, the Soviets were also experiencing success in influencing affairs in the Middle East, such as the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The invasion earned the Soviet Union almost universal condemnation by the international community.Garg, J. P.. 1981. \\"Russian penetration in Third World with special reference to Afghanistan\\". The Indian Journal of Political Science 42 (4).: 72‚Äì84. Following the 1979 invasion, the Soviets augmented their large aid commitments to shore up the Afghan economy and rebuild the Afghan military. They provided the Karmal regime an unprecedented $800 million. The Soviet Union supported the Najibullah regime even after the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February 1989. Today, unresolved questions concerning Soviet MIA/POWs in Afghanistan remain an issue between Russia and Afghanistan. =The Russian Federation= During the Afghan Civil War (1992-96), the Soviet House of Science and Culture in west Kabul was destroyed during fighting between rival factions. In 1993, Tajik rebels based in Afghanistan attacked a Russian border outpost in Tajikistan amid the Tajikistani Civil War, killing 25 Russians and prompting Russian retaliatory strikes, which caused extensive damage in northern Afghanistan. Reports of Afghan support for the rebels, part of the United Tajik Opposition against the Dushanbe government, led to cool relations between Russia and Afghanistan. Russia became increasingly disenchanted with the Taliban over their support for Chechen rebels and for providing a sanctuary for terrorist groups active in Central Asia and in Russia itself. Russia provided military assistance to the Afghan Northern Alliance, who eventually proved to be a major force in the efforts to overthrow the Taliban regime following United States intervention in 2001. In October 2005, Russian defence officials stated they would be giving helicopters and other military equipment to Afghanistan's army worth $30 million USD. Hamid Karzai and Dmitry Medvedev In October 2010, Afghan President Hamid Karzai reprimanded Russia after its forces entered the country without permission. He also stated that Russia has \\"violated Afghan sovereignty\\" in a joint mission with United States agents. However, after Russia's relations with the West soured following the Ukraine conflict, Moscow decided to become active and expand its role in Afghanistan, according to Omar Nassar, the director of the Moscow-based Center for Contemporary Afghan Studies (CISA). In an exclusive interview with Sputnik news agency, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said: \\"Our two countries have very close ties now.

Since 2016, it has provided the Afghan government with tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition. Moscow has already launched several efforts at diplomacy. Between December 2016 and April 2017, Russia hosted three rounds of talks involving China, Iran, and Pakistan. In the third round, it included Afghanistan, as well. In 2017, a new Russian cultural center was built and (re-)opened in Kabul's Darulaman Road, on the same site as the former Soviet-era House of Science and Culture which was built in 1982 and damaged by war in the 1990s.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-kabul-moscow-has-a- new-cultural-center-on-the-ashes-of-its-soviet- predecessor/2019/04/13/37fc9fcc-557e-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html A ceremony was held in Moscow on 28 May 2019 marking the 100th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

Horace is an old man who spends his afternoons in the local coffee shop with other old men, shaking dice to see who pays for coffee, and talking about politics, religion, and memorable Owl football teams of the past. Mitch is a stoic high school backup quarterback who is depressed for no apparent reason. Julia is the newest resident of Owl. She moved to the small town to teach history and spends much of her free time at the local bars (where she meets local celebrity Vance Druid). The town has about 850 residents and is semi-isolated from 1980s music and culture.

Most agriculture consists of subsistence farming, with only about 15% of the total production marketed. An estimated 1,351,000 hectares (3,338,000 acres), or about 52.6% of the total land area, is arable or under permanent crops; about 5.5% of cropland is irrigated. The average farm family plot is 0.8 hectares (two acres). Agriculture accounted for 51% of the GDP in 2004. Coffee and tea exports comprise the majority of foreign earnings; coffee alone accounted for 39% of exports of goods in 2004. Agricultural exports accounted for 48 percent of exports in 2004. Principal crops for local consumption are manioc, beans, bananas, sweet potatoes, corn, and sorghum. Production in 2004 included bananas, 1,600,000 tons, mostly for wine; manioc, 710,000 tons; sweet potatoes, 834,000 tons; beans, 220,000 tons; sorghum, 74,000 tons; corn, 123,000 tons; peanuts, 8,800 tons; and yams, 9,900 tons. Exports The primary export crop is coffee, chiefly of the arabica variety. The government regulates the grading, pricing, and marketing of the coffee crop, and all coffee export contracts require approval. In 2004, coffee production was 20,100 tons. Other export crops are cotton and tea. Seed cotton production was 3,000 tons, and cotton fiber production (after ginning) was about 1,300 tons in 2004. That year, tea production was 6,600 tons. Tea exports in 2004 of 753 tons represented 3% of total exports; the government has been encouraging cotton and tea production in order to diversify exports. Palm oil is obtained from trees in plantations along the shore of Lake Tanganyika. Tobacco and wheat cultivated in the highland areas also yield some cash income. Land Much of the land has suffered a loss of fertility because of soil erosion from poor agricultural practices, irregularity of rainfall, lack of fertilizer, and shortened fallow periods.

Overview Agriculture was the main source of growth and foreign exchange until 1978 when oil production replaced it as the cornerstone of growth for the formal economy. In 2004, agriculture contributed 44% to GDP. Agricultural development and productivity declined from neglect during the oil boom years of the early 1980s. Agriculture was the principal occupation of 56% of the economically active population in 2003, although only about 15.4% of the land was arable.  Production  Cameroon produced in 2018: * 5 million tons of cassava (13th largest producer in the world); * 3.9 million tonnes of plantain (3rd largest producer in the world, only behind Congo and Ghana); * 2.6 million tons of palm oil (7th largest producer in the world); * 2.3 million tons of maize; * 1.9 million tons of taro (3rd largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria and China); * 1.4 million tons of sorghum; * 1.2 million tons of banana; * 1.2 million tons of sugarcane; * 1 million tons of tomato (19th largest producer in the world); * 674 thousand tonnes of yam (7th largest producer in the world); * 594 thousand tons of peanut; * 410 thousand tons of sweet potato; * 402 thousand tons of beans; * 332 thousand tons of rice; * 310 thousand tons of pineapple; * 307 thousand tons of cocoa (5th largest producer in the world, losing to Ivory Coast, Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria); * 302 thousand tons of potato; * 301 thousand tons of onion; * 249 thousand tons of cotton; In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, such as coffee (33 thousand tons) and natural rubber (55 thousand tons). Cameroon production in 2018, by FAO Crops Potato field in Bamboutos Cooking bananas near Bandjoun Palm kernels in Tayap alt= Mr. Ateh Eldeno harvesting cocoa in his farm Cotton harvesting The most important cash crops are cocoa, coffee, cotton, bananas, rubber, palm oil and kernels, and peanuts. The main food crops are plantains, cassava, corn, millet, and sugarcane. Palm oil production has shown signs of strength, but the product is not marketed internationally. Cameroon bananas are sold internationally, and the sector was reorganized and privatized in 1987. Similarly, rubber output has grown in spite of Asian competition. Cameroon is among the world's largest cocoa producers; 130,000 tons of cocoa beans were produced in 2004. Two types of coffee, robusta and arabica, are grown; production was 60,000 tons in 2004. About 85,000 hectares (210,000 acres) are allocated to cotton plantations. Some cotton is exported, while the remainder is processed by local textile plants. Total cotton output was 109,000 tons in 2004. Bananas are grown mainly in the southwest; 2004 estimated production was 630,000 tons. The output of rubber, also grown in the southwest, was 45,892 tons in 2004. Estimated production in 2004 of palm kernels and oil was 64,000 and 1,200,000 tons, respectively. For peanuts (in the shell) the figure was 200,000 tons. Small amounts of tobacco, tea, and pineapples are also grown. Estimated 2004 production of food crops was as follows: sugarcane, 1,450,000 tons; cassava, 1,950,000 tons; sorghum, 550,000 tons; corn, 750,000 tons; millet, 50,000 tons; yams, 265,000 tons; sweet potatoes, 175,000 tons; potatoes, 135,000 tons; dry beans, 95,000 tons; and rice, 62,000 tons. Agriculture remains the backbone of Cameroon's economy, employing 70% of its workforce, while providing 42% of its GDP and 30% of its export revenue. Blessed with fertile land and regularly abundant rainfall in most regions, Cameroon produces a variety of agricultural commodities both for export and for domestic consumption. Coffee and cocoa are grown in central and southern regions, bananas in South west region, and cotton in several parts of Northern regions. In addition to export commodities, Cameroonian farmers produce numerous subsistence crops for family consumption. Principal food crops include millet, sorghum, peanuts, plantains, sweet potatoes, and manioc. Animal husbandry is practiced throughout the country and is particularly important in Northern region. (Encyclopedia of the Nations ¬ª Africa ¬ª Cameroon) According to a document jointly published in 2007 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MINADER), and that of Fishery, Livestock and Animal Husbandry (MINEPIA); in recent years, food production did not follow the rapid demographic increase, especially in the urban areas. According to these ministries, food security has to be assured by an increase in the production of food stuff and other crops which could substitute importations. To meet these needs, these ministries have as an objective for a sector‚Äôs development strategy, set a target in 2015 to train 30.000 farmers per year. MINADER has 35 centres for agricultural training (24 are rural training centres and 11 are centres for the training of young farmers). Furthermore, these two ministries are actually offering training in the rural development sector like extension agents, agricultural advisers and professional farmer groupings (farmers‚Äô organisations) The Government, faced with the effects of the financial crisis, has taken steps to boost production of commodities such as corn, rice, cassava, potato, oil palm and plantain. For food crops, these measures aim to improve commercialisation products through the construction of warehouses for conservation. In 2009, the agricultural sector accounted for approximately 75.6% of primary industry with 68.8% for food and agriculture 6.8% for export crops. This sub-sector increased by 8.3% compared to 2008, contributing 0.7 percentage point to growth actual primary sector. (Institut National de la Statistique ‚Äì Annuaire Statistique du Cameroun 2010) In 2009, the government through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development intends to implement an emergency plan to increase agricultural production. This plan aims to provide farmers planting material; subsidize pesticides and fertilizer from 20 to 50%, grant loans at low interest rates, create five pools of agricultural machinery support up to 15%, acquire about a hundred tractors and increase the capacity of processing, storage and packaging. All this will lead to improved agricultural production. The National Agricultural Extension and Agricultural Research (PNVRA) through outreach activities conducted by Extension Agents Zone (AVZ) provide technical guidance and sometimes financial farmers. (Institut National de la Statistique ‚Äì Annuaire Statistique du Cameroun 2010) In March 2012, ‚ÄúCameroun Tribune‚Äù published an article on the eve of the launching of the 2012 farming season in Cameroon, stating that apart from some few mechanised industrial exploitations, agriculture in Cameroon is essentially traditional. With subsistence agriculture, manual work is usually very arduous, the cultivated surface area is also reduced, and yields are low and therefore insufficient to meet both domestic and external demand for food. This article reveals that Cameroon is forced to import large quantities of cereals (rice, maize) to fill the gap in production, feed its population and meet the demands of the brewing industries. That is why during the agro pastoral show in Ebolowa, President Paul Biya stressed the need to modernised Cameroon‚Äôs agriculture, so as to increase the productivity of small farmers and encourage the emergence of ‚Äúsecond generation‚Äù production units; that is to say large and medium size companies. In this perspective, the mechanisation of agriculture must be a fact, given the multiplier effect of machines in the chain of production.

Infinite Space is a science fiction role-playing video game that allows the player to design and control a spaceship. The player can customize the ship with over 150 different design models, along with over 150 possible crewmembers. After customizing a ship, the player can explore an expansive game world with a story spanning two galaxies. Characters seen in the game are displayed in 2D, while ships, exploration, and battles are in 3D.IGN: Infinite Line Preview The entire game is controlled by the touchscreen. Neither characters nor spacecraft are controlled directly, but rather, are controlled in a \\"point and click\\" type manner. Travel is done by first choosing a destination, then engaging the engines to move towards that destination. Spaceship battles occur in real-time, with attacks utilizing a \\"command gauge\\" feature. As the command gauge builds up, the player can use it to perform attacks against an enemy ship. The rate at which the command gauge fills depends on the type of ship, and the crew of the ship. When the player boards an enemy ship, the player takes control of their character to move through the ship. Characters aren't moved directly, but rather by selecting commands, such as \\"move right\\". Melee battles are fought too, using a system similar to \\"rock, paper, scissors\\", and a command gauge that is similar to the one used in spaceship battles. Multiplayer spaceship battles are also available for two-players to play competitively over local Wi-Fi. The game also features a non-linear branching narrative, with numerous choices that can have dramatic consequences. The game needs to be played multiple times in order to see the different possible paths in the narrative, which is helped by a New Game+ mode that is unlocked after completing the game for the first time.  Plot  = Setting = Infinite Space contains themes from the novel Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke. The plot is divided into two main storylines; both are centered around Yuri, a starship captain-in-training, and take place ten years apart. The game is set tens of thousands of years in the future, when mankind has spread across several galaxies. While faster-than- light travel using \\"inflation inverter\\" engines is the standard for all spaceships, ancient constructs called Void Gates are necessary to travel wider distances that would still take years to cross. Ruined, inactive Void Gates called Dead Gates can also be found, but are seen as nothing more than scientific curiosities. Infinite Space focuses on Yuri's quest to discover the ultimate purpose of the Epitaphs, artifacts scattered throughout the universe. Most of the game takes place in two galaxies: the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Large Magellanic Cloud. In the first part of the game, which takes place in the SMC, Yuri becomes aware of the Lugovalian Empire, a very large and powerful intergalactic empire, which is ruled by an iron fist by Emperor Taranis. Learning of their desire to conquer the SMC, Yuri tries to coordinate the galaxy's forces for a defense, but they quickly fall to the Lugovalian threat. In the second part of the game, or ten years after the fall of the SMC, Yuri again tries to coordinate the defenses of the LMC amidst an impending Lugovalian invasion. = Story =  Part 1  Infinite Space begins as Nia Lochlain, a \\"launcher\\" who helps people leave their homeworlds to travel in space, assists her client Yuri leave his homeworld Ropesk and break the ban on space travel there. Ropesk's ruler Demid Panfilov takes Yuri's sister Kira hostage to force him to return. Yuri pawns his Epitaph, which he believes to be a gift from his father, to buy his own ship, then confronts Panfilov and rescues Kira. Sometime later, Yuri hears that the pawnshop holding his Epitaph has been attacked by pirates. He pursues the pirates, but is unable to prevent the legendary pirate Valantin from taking his Epitaph. Vowing to best Valantin with a ship of his own, Yuri proceeds to the Interplanetary Union of Elgava and assists in defeating the local pirate faction. As a result of his actions, he is invited by Commander Oleg Vladykin to research Epitaphs in Elgava Central. There, Vladykin informs Yuri that an Elgavan probe ship studying Epitaphs has disappeared; Yuri verifies the ship was destroyed and learns that Epitaphs are sometimes found near Dead Gates. After a trip to Kalymnos to examine the ruins of a Dead Gate near the planet Mytilene, Commander Vladykin alerts Yuri that a fleet traveling from another galaxy was what destroyed the Elgavan probe ship, and this fleet's destination is the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Nia reveals to Yuri that the fleet belongs to the distant Lugovalian Empire and is vastly more powerful than the combined forces of the entire SMC. Yuri then travels to the Spetses sector to rescue the kidnapped granddaughter of a prominent Nova Nacio industrialist, but he encounters the pirate Valantin in ruins on Spetses that match those found on Mytilene. Valantin gives Yuri the Spetses Epitaph, which transforms and reactivates a nearby Dead Gate. Yuri follows Valantin through the restored Void Gate into a Flux Sector, a region of space that constantly fluctuates into different states of existence. Valantin escapes and Yuri loses consciousness, reawakening in the remote Irvest sector. Yuri then journeys to the Magellanic Stream to allow Nia the chance to warn the nations of the Large Magellanic Cloud about the Lugovalian invasion fleet, and then is forced to choose sides in a war between Kalymnos and Nova Nacio over the Irvest sector. While Yuri works to end that conflict, Elgava makes contact with the Lugovalian fleet. Having greatly underestimated the Lugovalians' power, the Elgavan contact force is easily destroyed and Elgava falls days later. The defeat of the most powerful nation in the SMC prompts Nova Nacio to surrender to the Lugovalians immediately, while Kalymnos puts up a futile resistance. With the entire SMC now subjugated by the Lugovalian Empire, Yuri and Nia travel to the Magellanic Stream to request the aid of the LMC nation Regeinland. The Lugovalian fleet arrives at the Magellanic Stream but is intercepted by a force from Regeinland. Lacking the strength to engage the Lugovalians, the Regeinlandics decide to seal off the starlane to the LMC. Yuri leads an attack on their fleet and manages to cripple their flagship. Nia boards the flagship and is mortally wounded while attempting to kill the Lugovalian commander. Meanwhile, the Regeinlandics deploy a prototype \\"exalaser\\" and cause a nearby red giant star to go supernova, wiping out much of both fleets and enveloping the Void Gate that leads to the LMC. Yuri and his remaining crew escape to the LMC before the Void Gate is sealed.  Part 2  The second half of Infinite Space, subtitled \\"Yuri the Man\\", begins 10 years after the Lugovalian conquest of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The Galactic Federation of the Large Magellanic Cloud has suppressed all information about the fall of the SMC and imprisoned all SMC refugees, but the Lugovalian Empire is close to discovering a new route to the LMC. Yuri has been imprisoned on the prison asteroid Lari, but manages to escape with some friends and later rescues his old crew. Soon after he is surrounded by fleets from the nations of Libertas and Regeinland and chooses to surrender to the Regeinlandics, who enlist Yuri to help them prepare for the Lugovalians. As a test Yuri is asked to resolve a civil war in the frontier nation of Escondido, where he obtains another Epitaph. Regeinland then sends Yuri to investigate a newly discovered Void Gate which may link to the SMC. Yuri uses the Epitaph to stabilize the Void Gate and takes it to the Spetses sector in the SMC, where he reunites with more of his old crew and reconnoiters the Lugovalians for the Regeinlandic military. Upon his return to the LMC, the fate of the SMC is made public and the LMC nations begin fortifying their borders. Libertas promotes an unpopular resolution to unify Galactic Federation members under a single government to fight Lugovalos. Coupled with news of a premeditated attack by Libertas against a small defenseless nation, the Federation becomes divided against Libertas and civil war breaks out. Regeinland heads a coalition of nations to assume control of the Federation and commissions Yuri to subdue two of Libertas' allies. With Libertas isolated, the balance of power shifts in Regeinland's favor. Regeinland proceeds to move against the Orders group, the hardliner element of Libertas and the Federation. Once Orders' fleet is defeated, Libertas backs down and concedes to the Regeinland-led nations. The Federation president summons representatives from all Federation nations to the capital Merylgild, and a defense plan to confront Lugovalos is unanimously passed; for the first time in its 500 year history, the Galactic Federation is truly united. Despite being prepared, when Lugovalos finally invades the LMC, the Federation fleet guarding the Void Gate to the SMC is routed and surrounding sectors are captured. During the defense of the Andalucia sector, Yuri realizes he has the power to manipulate Flux Sectors and in effect alter the reality within them. Later, Federation forces claim a decisive victory over a significant detachment of the Lugovalian fleet, slowing their advance through the LMC. Meanwhile, the Holy Nation of Adis begins claiming responsibility for the disappearances of ships using Void Gates. Yuri, now a hero of the Federation, leads a force to conquer Adis and end the supposed threat. Afterward, Patriarch Bogd of Adis reveals to Yuri the existence of the Overlords, omnipotent entities who create universes. The Overlords revealed themselves to the first humans, the Progenitors, on Terra thousands of years ago, bestowing the technology to travel faster-than-light and endure the rigors of space travel. Once humans had expanded throughout the entire universe, the Overlords would initiate the End of Days. Bogd explains that Yuri has his powers over Epitaphs and Flux sectors because he is an Observer, created directly by the Overlords; Kira is not Yuri's sister, but a Tracker created to trace Yuri's movements. The Void Gates collected the experiences of Observers and Trackers for the Overlords. At the site of the Ark of the Progenitors, Bogd tells Yuri that the Lugovalian emperor, Taranis, was also an Observer, and the reason for Lugovalos' conquest was to unite humanity to oppose the Overlords. When attempting to access the Overlords' network to discover how to defeat them, Kira is erased from existence, her body reduced into a dead android and an Epitaph. Meanwhile, the Lugovalians continue strengthening their positions. Unable to negotiate with them, Yuri uses Kira's Epitaph to open a Void Gate into the SMC to assault Emperor Taranis' flagship. Yuri breaks through the Lugovalian main fleet and defeats Taranis, forcing him to retreat. Taranis then orders a ceasefire and peace talks between Lugovalos and the Galactic Federation are opened. Suddenly, Overlord ship-like entities called Phages appear and begin attacking everything in sight; the Phages' purpose is to break the universe down into dark matter and prepare for the creation of the next one. As more and more Phages arrive and begin dismantling planets and Void Gates shut down, Yuri escapes with the timely help of Valantin. At Merylgild, Valantin explains that the only way to stop the Overlords from destroying the universe is to find the \\"True Warp Gate\\" that connects to their dimension and close it. Information from the Kira-android confirms the Gate itself is in the Solar System, the long-lost birthplace of humanity. Yuri, Valantin, Taranis, and other people Yuri has met along the way travel to the Solar System using the Void Gate frame built into Valantin's ship. Near Mars, Valantin sacrifices himself to let Yuri destroy the True Warp Gate, which is in orbit around Terra and powered by a Dyson sphere encapsulating Sol. While Yuri fights off Phages, Taranis crashes his ship into the Dyson sphere, destroying it and closing the gate. The game ends as Yuri's ship slowly approaches a Flux sector, Yuri cradling the Kira android in his lap. After the credits, Yuri's ship is seen heading away from the now- stabilized Flux sector and Kira is briefly shown to have been restored. It is unknown if Yuri used his power to alter anything else in the universe.  Development and release  Infinite Space was known as Infinite Line, during its production.SEGA Unravels the Mystery of the Universe with Infinite Space Legendary anime mechanical designer Kazutaka Miyatake of Studio Nue -famous for his work in the Macross science fiction series- made several spaceship designs for the game.  Reception  Reception for the game has been generally positive. Japan's Famitsu magazine rated it 9/9/8/8 for a total of 34 points, earning it a Gold award. Famitsu applauded the large volume of the game, along with its extensive customization and intricate story. While some Famitsu reviewers liked this, others were overwhelmed by the amount of detail, and the steep learning curve. Among Western critics, Infinite Space received aggregate ratings of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic, and 76% on GameRankings. IGN gave it a score of 7 out of 10, stating that the game had an \\"epic story\\", but that the steep learning curve and clunky interface would test player's patience in being able to get to the good parts of it. GamesRadar had a similar view, praising the multifaceted story, but complaining about interface problems, such as how the player can customize the ship, but cannot directly see how different parts affect the ships statistics while actually doing the building itself. Overall, GamesRadar gave it a score of 9 out of 10, concluding that what it \\"lacks in the soft approachability of a Pok√©mon or Super Mario RPG, it makes up for in bombastic scale and mettle. Hundreds of planets. Hundreds of interesting, fully formed characters. Hundreds of lasers, mess halls and intergalactic toilets to equip. Infinite Space feels like proper grown-up gaming and a proper grown-up journey. Our hero grows from boy to man[sic], and the DS matures with him.\\" RPGFan gave it a glowing review, giving it a 92% score, and stating, \\"There truly is a grand sense of time and space in this game; it is a long story told across multiple galaxies and dozens of star systems. It is that rare RPG that genuinely makes you feel like the fate of the whole universe is at stake and is actually worthy of its grandiose name. Easily on par with anything you'll find in Xenosaga or Mass Effect, this is not just good science fiction, but a space opera for the ages.\\"http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/infinitespace/index.html RPGamer gave it a score of 4 out of 5, noting that the \\"narrative features numerous choices to make, some of which have dramatic consequences,\\" and concluding that \\"the game's battles are entertaining, the story is one of the most gripping in video games, the subject matter is unique, and the rewards for exploration and customization are plentiful. These qualities are plenty to make it one of the DS's top RPGs.\\" = Sales = During the first week following its release in Japan, Infinite Space sold 38,000 units and was the highest selling game in Japan during that period. Sales tracking company Media Create predicted that the game would have a 92% sell-through rate, indicating that it could continue to perform well on the market.

Crops Salto, island of Fogo. The most widespread agricultural activity of the Cape Verde islands is gardening for domestic consumption. Garden crops include corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, and bananas. Only about 11.2 percent of the land area is suitable for crop production. Frequent droughts often exacerbate an ongoing water shortage. Agriculture employed about 21% of the active population and contributed 15% to GDP in 2003. Estimated 2004 production figures were sugarcane, 14,000 tons; corn, 14,000 tons; bananas, 6,000 tons; coconuts, 5,000 tons; mangoes, 4,500 tons; cassava, 3,000 tons; and potatoes, 3,500 tons. Only the islands of S√£o Tiago, S√£o Vicente, S√£o Nicolau, Fogo and Santo Ant√£o have conditions suitable for raising cash crops. Bananas, almost the only agricultural export, are grown on irrigated land. On Fogo, wine and coffee are grown for export: In 2008, 108 t of grapes where harvested on an area of more than 200 ha.Pitt Reitmeier: Cabo Verde, p.394. Bielefeld 2009. In 2008, 21 t of coffee were harvested on Fogo after 35 t in 2006 and 45 t in 2007.Susanne Lipps: Kapverdische Inseln, p. 262. Ostfildern 2009 Sugarcane, another cash crop, is used on the islands to produce rum. Development Agriculture has been the focus of development aid programs since the 1960s, but progress has been frustrated by drought, locusts, overgrazing, and archaic cultivation methods. Approximately 85‚Äì90% of food needs are met by imports; agricultural imports had a value of $112.8 million in 2004. Land reform The African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) nationalized a few large-scale irrigated agricultural operations and began a program of land reform and cooperative agriculture; sharecropping was abolished. During 1976‚Äì80, 7,200 rainwater dikes were built. Torrential rains in 1984 destroyed much of this work, but by 1986, 17,000 dikes and 25,000 stone retaining walls had been completed. There has been little land redistribution, despite a 1982 law distributing farms over five hectares (12.5 acres)‚Äî1 hectare (2.5 acres) if irrigated‚Äîamong the tenants if the land is not directly farmed by the owners.

President Putin with President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan during a ceremony for signing Russian-Azerbaijani documents. Azerbaijan‚ÄìRussia relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation. History What is now Azerbaijan became part of the Russian Empire after Qajar Iran was forced to cede it alongside all of its other Caucasian territories following the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì13) and the outcoming Treaty of Gulistan and the Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28) and its outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay. The area to the North of the river Aras, among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia. Following decades of being part of the Russian empire, Azerbaijan's independence, it subsequently got annexed into the Soviet Union in 1920. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, relations between the two countries started to get close due to Ayaz Mutallibov's foreign policy.An Analysis of Hegemony in Azerbaijani-Russian relations However, after the Armenian occupation of Khojaly, Mutallibov was forced to resign which resulted in Abulfaz Elchibey coming to power. During one-year rule of Elchibey, Azerbaijan‚ÄìRussia relations were damaged. Elchibay's politics have been described as \\"Anti-Russian.\\" When Heydar Aliyev came to power in 1993, he settled warmer relations with Russia. Russia has an embassy in Baku, and Azerbaijan has an embassy in Moscow and consulate-general in Saint Petersburg. Azerbaijan also announced that it will open another consulate-general in Yekaterinburg. There are more than half a million Azeris in Russia as well as a notable diaspora of Russians in Azerbaijan, which is the largest Russian diaspora in the region. President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev stated that the peoples of Russia and Azerbaijan were tied with \\"closest friendship and trust links\\". Relations between the two countries remain friendly and close but there are numerous disagreements such as in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the South Ossetian-Abkhazian conflict and the legal status of the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan supported Russia on the Chechnya issue and closed the office of Chechen rebel president Aslan Maskhadov's representative in Baku, as they faced a possible separatist movement by Lezghins (Lezgistan). Some analysts argued that Russia was neutral and somewhat supported Azerbaijan in the Karabakh conflict in the beginning of the 1990s until Elchibey's nationalist government took office, which caused Russia to sign many military agreements with Armenia.Russian-Azerbaijani relations Alaytic View Even though this, along with the memory of Black January in 1990, causes distrust of Russia in Azerbaijani society, mainly among nationalists, according to a poll taken in 2007, about of 80% of Azeris approve of the friendship with Russia. After the 2008 war with Georgia, this number dropped to 52%.Neither Friend nor Foe Russophobia had never been common in Azerbaijan and the government is also strongly committed to protecting the rights of ethnic Russians in Azerbaijan, but hostility exists toward Russians who are married to or otherwise connected with Armenians.The Status of Minorities in Azerbaijan Azeris often face discrimination in Russia because of the common \\"Caucasophobia\\" after the Chechen Wars, with the main reason considered to be that Russians cannot differentiate between Azerbaijanis and other Caucasian nationalities. =Russia's weapons transfers to Armenia in 2008= At the beginning of 2009 Azerbaijani media published allegations that Russia had made extensive weapons transfers to Armenia throughout 2008 costing about $800 mln. On January 12, 2009 the Russian ambassador was invited to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs and asked about this information. On January 21, 2009 Russian ministry of foreign relations officially denied the transfers. According to the materials published by Wikileaks in December 2010 Azerbaijani defence minister Safar Abiyev claimed that in January 2009 during his visit to Moscow his Russian counterpart Sergei Ivanov unofficially had admitted weapon transfers although officially it was denied. Military cooperation Vladimir Putin and Heydar Aliyev in Moscow, 2000. On 27 February 2003, in Baku, Russia and Azerbaijan signed an intergovernmental agreement on military-technical cooperation, and on 4 December 2006 the parties signed an intergovernmental agreement on mutual protection of rights of intellectual property. The leaders of defense departments of both countries make guest visits on a regular basis. On 23‚Äì25 January 2006 Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and Minister of Defense Sergei Ivanov visited Baku. In November 2007, Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov also visited Azerbaijan. On 29 July 29, 2008, in Moscow, the Second Meeting of Russia-Azerbaijan Intergovernmental Commission on Military- Technical Cooperation took place. On 25 January 2002, an agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Azerbaijan on the status, principles and conditions for use of the Gabala radar station (radar station, \\"DTV\\") was signed, and on 28 November 2003 an intergovernmental protocol was signed, dealing with the question on how to open and use the credits to pay for the costs with the use of information-analytical center for the period 1997‚Äì2001. On 2007 June 20 the Intergovernmental Protocol was signed, addressing the status of authorized representatives of Russia and Azerbaijan, appointed to execute the Agreement on the status, principles and conditions of use of the radar \\"DTV\\". Vladimir Putin, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and Ilham Aliyev. On June 8, 2007, at the G-8 summit in Heiligendamm, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a proposal to use the Qabala radar station as a part of the U.S.-developed missile defense system. The proposal was supported by the Azerbaijani leadership, which considered it as a concrete contribution to stability and security in the region. Border cooperation remains an important component of Azerbaijan‚ÄìRussia relations, taking into account the overall situation in the Caucasus and the common objectives of the struggle against international terrorism. On 25 January 2002 an intergovernmental agreement on the activities of border service representatives was signed. The consultations are going about an agreement on opening of border service offices on the territories of both countries. On 29‚Äì30 January 2008, Moscow hosted the XV round of talks on the delimitation of the border with Azerbaijan. The agreed boundary line, which was outlined in the working protocols, map and descriptive documents, is , which corresponds to the 90% of the total border of . Dmitry Medvedev and Ilham Aliyev, Moscow. 2 November 2008 Law enforcement and judicial authorities of Russia and Azerbaijan cooperate as well. Signed in April 1996, the Agreement between the Russian Interior Ministry and the Interior Ministry of Azerbaijan on cooperation of internal affairs in border areas entered into force in 2001. Also there were the following agreements: Memorandum of mutual relations in the fight against terrorism (February 2000) and protocols on cooperation, a memorandum on cooperation between the Russian Interior Ministry and the Interior Ministry in the field of preservation of goods in transit (July 2008). Economic relations Trade and economic cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan is on the rise. In 2008 the trade turnover between the two countries increased annually by 39.3% and amounted to US$2.403 billion, exports grew by 42.6% up to $1.9911 billion, imports increased by 25.4% up to $411.4 million. Despite the end of Russian gas deliveries to Azerbaijan on January 1, 2007, the trade has kept a positive trend, and its structure has evolved towards an increasing share of non- primary goods. Cultural relations Medvedev lays a wreath at the monument to heroes (Baku) Russian‚ÄìAzerbaijani relations in culture and education are developing steadily. In December 2006, the two countries adopted a program of interstate cooperation in the humanitarian sphere for 2007‚Äì2009. 2005 was the \\"Year of Azerbaijan\\" in Russia and 2006 was the \\"Year of Russia\\" in Azerbaijan; the two countries held 110 special cultural events during these two years. In 2008, in Baku, a branch of Moscow State University was established. In the universities of Azerbaijan over 15 thousand students are involved in Russian language education. In Azerbaijan there are over 50 Russian-language newspapers and 10 Russian news agencies. Breakdown and renewal After a string of breakdowns in the 2010s, including renewal of the lease of the Gabala Radar Station to Russia, and the consequent constructions of the a new station in Russia's own Krasnodar Region, the decision by Russia to stop transit of Azeri oil via the Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline, the holding of the Azerbaijani tanker \\"Naphthalene\\" in Dagestan on suspicion of hauling contraband and the Federal Lezgian National and Cultural Autonomy movement's announcement that Lezgians were be in August 2013. The discussions involved the issue of regulation of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Caspian Sea legal regime and cooperation in energy. Additionally, an agreement on cooperation and terms for oil supply was signed by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and Rosneft; while there was also an agreement on the construction of a new automobile bridge across the Samur River, on the joint border. The visit took on added importance as it was read as leveraging Armenia‚ÄìAzerbaijan relations in a warning in light of Armenia considering signing an Association Agreement with the European Union.

Biography He is the son of Vasile Breban, a Greek Catholic priest in the village of Recea, Maramure»ô County. His mother, Olga Constan≈£a Esthera Breban, born B√∂hmler, descended from a family of German merchants who emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine. In 1951, he was expelled from school on account of his social origin when in the penultimate year at the ‚ÄûCoriolan Brediceanu‚Äù High School in Lugoj. He worked as an office clerk in Oradea, and finally passed the graduation exams at the ‚ÄûOltea Doamna‚Äù High School. As he intended to study at the Polytechnical Institute, he had to work first as an apprentice at the \\"23 August‚Äù Works in Bucharest. He enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy by ‚Äûforging personal documents‚Äù as he candidly admitted in Confesiuni violente (\\"Violent Confessions\\"). His reading of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer made him, in fact, suspicious in the eyes of Dean Athanase Joja. He made his literary debut in ‚ÄûVia≈£a studen≈£eascƒÉ‚Äù (no. 5, May 1957), with the sketch Doamna din vis (\\"The Lady in the Dream\\"). At the 10th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party, held between 6 and 12 August 1969, he was elected a substitute member of the Central Committee. Beginning with issue no. 20 of 14 May 1970, he was editor-in-chief of the literary review Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ, around which he attracted some of Romania's most important writers. In 1971, the premi√®re of the movie Printre colinele verzi/Among the Green Hills (written and directed by Nicolae Breban), the film version of Sick Animals, took place. The communist authorities were quite annoyed by this movie, but it was nevertheless included in the official selection for the International Festival of Cannes. While in Paris, Nicolae Breban remained shocked by the so-called \\"July Theses‚Äù, by means of which Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, following the Maoist model, was trying to start some kind of Cultural Revolution. The writer publicly repudiated the cultural policy of the Romanian regime in a number of interviews published in the Western media, and, in protest, resigned his position as editor-in-chief of \\"Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ‚Äù. Back home, in 1972, the communist authorities regarded him as an outcast. He was therefore marginalized, watched by the police, and not allowed to travel abroad again until 1975, despite having also acquired German citizenship that year. Without actually becoming an exile, he lived mostly in Paris with his wife, Cristina, between 1986 and 1989. He returned to Romania, and in 1990 launched a new series of the literary review \\"Contemporanul. Ideea europeanƒÉ\\". On 24 October 1997, he became a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy, and on 14 January 2009, a full member.

Architecture The Williams House is a two-story frame building with a full basement and an attic. It is cast in the Queen Anne style of architecture. It contains many projecting and receding forms, common of Queen Anne houses. Some of those include its multiple gables, and its polygonal and round and towers. The interior is largely open on the first floor and much of the interior details and woodwork remain intact. Historic significance The Williams House has two main areas of importance, architecture and local history. As one of the last \\"great\\" 19th-century houses in Streator, it stands as a symbol to its builder and his accomplishments in early Streator. The house is also important architecturally.

Russia has an embassy in Dhaka and a consulate-general in Chittagong, while Bangladesh has an embassy in Moscow. Diplomatic relations between the USSR and Bangladesh were established on January 25, 1972. These relations have continued with Russia being the successor state to the Soviet Union.  Soviet-Bangladeshi relations  The Soviet Union had been a strong supporter of the Bengali freedom fighters during the Bangladesh Liberation War and provided extensive aid, recognising that Bangladesh's independence would weaken the position of its rivals ‚Äì the United States and China. In November 1971, the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Alexei Rodionov, directed a secretive message (Rodionov message) that ultimately warned Pakistan that \\"it will be embarking on a suicidal course if it escalates tensions in the subcontinent. On 6 and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers, armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok, to trail the United States' Task Force 74 in the Indian Ocean from 18 December until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a Ballistic missile submarine to ward off the threat posed by the USS Enterprise task force in the Indian Ocean. Relations with the Soviet Union were cordial in the years immediately following independence. The Soviet Union supported Indian actions in aiding the war of independence, and after the war the Soviet Navy sent a floating workshop to Bangladesh for clearing Pakistani mines from the Chittagong and Chalna harbours. After independence, the newly formed Bangladesh Air Force received a significant donation from the Soviet Union. Among the aircraft delivered were ten single-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21MFs and two twin-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21UMs. In March 1972, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman visited Moscow, in part to thank the Soviet state for their support for Bangladeshi liberation movement in 1971. After the 1975 coup in Bangladesh, relations with the Soviet Union rapidly cooled. The military regimes of Zia and Ershad deemphasized socialist policies and vied for closer ties with the United States, Arab states, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China‚Äîall of which were politically distant from the Soviet Union. Bangladesh condemned Soviet support for Vietnamese military intervention in Cambodia, and Bangladesh also strongly opposed the 1979 Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan along with other Western and Islamic nations. In 1989, the Soviet Union ranked 14th among aid donors to Bangladesh. The Soviets focused on the development of electrical power, natural gas and oil, and maintained active cultural relations with Bangladesh. They financed the Ghorasal thermal power station, the largest in Bangladesh. A low point in Bangladeshi-Soviet relations came after the expulsion of nine Soviet diplomats from Dhaka in December 1983 and January 1984 by the unpopular military regime of General Ershad.  Russian-Bangladeshi relations  = State visits = In 2009, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited St. Petersburg and met Russian President Vladimir Putin. In January 2013, Sheikh Hasina again met Russian President Putin in Moscow. = Energy cooperation = In 2012, the two countries signed two key Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) which would further facilitate collaboration between the two countries in developing the nuclear power sector in Bangladesh. = Defence cooperation = Russia has conducted an military sales effort in Bangladesh and has succeeded with a $124 million deal for eight MIG-29 fighter jets.

Crops The economy of the Comoros is primarily agricultural, with arable land comprising 45 percent of the total land area. Among the chief crops in 2004, in tons, were manioc, 58,000; coconuts, 77,000; bananas, 65,000; sweet potatoes, 5,500; rice, 17,000; corn, 4,000; and cloves, 3,000. Other crops include sugarcane, sisal, peppers, spices, coffee, and various perfume plants such as ylang-ylang, abelmosk, lemon grass, jasmine, and citronella. Exports The chief export crops are vanilla, cloves, ylang-ylang, and copra. The Comoros, including Mayotte, account for about 80% of world production of ylang-ylang essence, which is used in some perfumes. Marketed exports in 2004 included 44 tons of dried vanilla, valued at nearly $18.8 million, or 47% of agricultural exports. Imports Food demand is not met by domestic production, so the Comoros is highly dependent on imported foods, especially rice. Over half of all foodstuff s are imported, and about 50% of the government‚Äôs annual budget is spent on importing food. Productivity Agricultural productivity is extremely low, and cultivation methods are rudimentary. Fertilizer is seldom used by smallholders. About 20 percent of the cultivated land belongs to company estates; 20 percent to indigenous land owners who live in towns and pay laborers to cultivate their holdings; and 60 percent to village reserves allotted according to customary law.

The church was built to serve the spiritual needs of people moving to Swindon because of the Great Western Railway Works. The building was designed by W A H Masters, who also designed St Luke's Church, Broad Street, Swindon, and St Philip's, Upper Stratton. The church is in the Diocese of Bristol and the province of Canterbury, and is dedicated to St. Augustine of Canterbury.More than 1,000 poppies hanging through the church to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armistice Earlier churches In what is thought to be a former church schoolroom built around 1873, the Rodbourne Cheney District Room became a mission chapel in the early 1880s within the parish of St Mary Rodbourne Cheney. The inventory records that the licence holding Divine Services was acquired on 2 April 1881. The earliest known record of a baptism dates from 1885. The Rev W Mould, vicar of St Mary's and also chaplain to Queen Victoria, found difficulty in covering services at the chapel and made arrangements for St Mark's Church (another 'railway' church) to cover services and pastoral work. On 26 October 1904, Rev Henry Harvey was licensed as missionary curate in St Augustine's district. He went on to serve the church in Rodbourne for a total of 29 years, was made Honorary Chaplain to the Bishop, and on completion of 25 years' service was made an Honorary Canon of Bristol Cathedral. Building and consecration The foundation stone of St Augustine's was laid on 13 April 1907 amid much ceremony, and was the first time that the Freemasons in Wiltshire were involved in a church service. Building commenced at the East end and the church in its current state was consecrated on 25 January 1908. The bricks were paid for by the parishioners and cost one old penny each. Sadly, money ran out and the side aisles, porches, bell tower and further chapels were never completed. It is one of the few churches in the south of England, and one of two in Swindon, built in the basilica style, and consists of a large nave of six wide bays and apse with a walled choir surrounded by aisles. There is no physical division between nave and choir in the main building, so it is effectively a large hall. The vestry and lady chapel are at the northeast corner of the church. The church is approximately , and the nave roof reaches about . The apse arch is about . The single bell weighs four and a half hundredweight, or . The font is an exact replica of the fine Norman font at St Leonard's Church Stanton Fitzwarren. It is divided into ten compartments, each with a Latin inscription. The first, Eclesia stands for the church ‚Äì and the carving is of the crowned Divine Bride, holding the sacred chalice and killing evil (depicted as a serpent) with the stem of the cross. The second compartment, inscribed Cherubim shows a six winged cherubim, with its eyes covered to show its spiritual nature. The Cherubim holds a sword to show it is guardian of the Church. The font at St Augustine's with the depictions of good overcoming evil ‚Äì a replica of the font at Stanton Fitzwarren The other eight compartments show eight crowned knights holding shields and weapons. These represent the goodly Christian Virtues and they are depicted dwarfing figures, which represent the evil vices fighting in the baptised soul. Details of these remaining compartments are: *Largitas v Avaricia (Bounty overcoming Avarice) *Humilitas v Superbia (Humility overcoming pride) *Pietas v Discordia (Gentleness overcoming strife) *Misericordia v Invidia (Mercy overcoming envy) *Modestia v Ebrietas (Sobriety overcoming Drunkenness and excess) *Temperancia v Luxuria (Temperance overcoming Wantonness) *Pacientcia v Ira (Patience overcoming Anger) *Pucicicia v Libido (Chastity overcoming impure lust) Apse painting at St Augustine's Church, Swindon, of Christ Pantocator with the virgin and child and St Augustine Other artwork in the church includes the apse painting, two icons and two triptychs designed and painted by Fleur Kelly in the late 1980s and 1990s. The apse painting consists of the central figure of Christ Pantocator with Mary and Child and an elderly St Augustine. The icons to the sides of the apse are of Pope Gregory the Great and King Ethelbert of Kent. The triptychs are of the Virgin Mary and Child, and St Augustine holding a model of the current church. There are six stained glass windows: three in the apse and the ocular window high in the nave above the apse arch date from the earlier years of the church. Two other windows on the South side are from the 1950s. The south window of St Peter is by Basil Barber, an apprentice of Sir Ninian Comper.  Parish  From 2004 until 2018, St Augustine's was joined in a united benefice with All Saints, Ferndale and St Barnabas, Gorse Hill. Since late 2018, St Augustine's is a separate parish. Music The church has a strong musical tradition, the choir of the early days consisted of a choir of men and boys numbering nearly 50. Women were allowed into the choir for the first time in the mid-1970s. The choir presented the nameplate of the steam engine \\"Westminster Abbey\\" to the choirboys there, and it can still be seen in the choir school to this day. The church returned to Westminster Abbey to commemorate the presentation in March 2015. Sir John Betjeman was said to be a regular visitor to choral evensong and once hosted the choir at his Wantage Estate for a summer choir camp. The choir has previously sung in cathedrals and major churches including St Paul's, Westminster Abbey and St Mary Redcliffe and was well known in the locality for its size and quality. The church has had two organs. The pipe organ of two manuals and 12 stops (896 pipes), built by Hele of Plymouth, was decommissioned in 2003, and most of the pipework and action has been removed except for the large Open Diapason display pipes, some pedal pipes and the bottom 12 notes of the Dulciana stop which are now displayed on the church floor. The current organ is a two-manual digital organ of 33 speaking stops. This organ was donated to the church in 2003, and the church has had five recitals by Professor Ian Tracey, Organist Titulaire of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral. The speakers of the digital organ are positioned high up in the organ loft, about above the North stalls of the choir.  Events  In 2018, a display of 1,300 poppies commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Armistice and the end of World War One. The poppies were made by pupils of Even Swindon Primary School and church members, and hung on thin lines so that they appeared to float above the congregation and visitor alike. Other displays included a cascade of knitted poppies over the font and from the high altar, \\"There but Not There\\" silhouettes, and information on the local men who never came home. Photos of the displays were included in most UK national newspapers and the church was used by BBC Points West for a live broadcast of their evening news programme on 9 November 2018, the Friday before Remembrance Sunday. The programme was anchored by Alex Lovell.

The Family Book of Mary Claire covers the extraordinary history of two families on the NSW coast. The Switherby Pilgrims and Jamberoo Road are about early settlers in the state, orphaned \\"pilgrims\\" from England, struggling to establish a new home in the untamed Australia of the 1820s.Review of Jamberoo Road Two books, Me and Jeshua and Miranda Going Home, are set by contrast in first century Palestine. The first is about the childhood of Jesus of Nazareth, the second about the daughter of a mixed marriage between a Jewish woman and a Roman centurion. Many of her books demonstrate acute observation of family life, revealed with sensitivity and humour. The Somerville family in The Green Laurel is one example. She has spoken of a childhood fascination with orphans: \\"I yearned to adopt neglected infants, [but] had to settle for adopting stray kittens or turning my assortment of dolls into orphanage-waifs.\\"Quoting Something about the Author and orphans often feature in her books, notably the settler books and The Left Overs. Eleanor Spence was one of the first authors for older children to include issues such as disability, prejudice and homosexuality in her books. Glen, the protagonist of The Nothing Place is partially deaf, and he strikes up a friendship with another \\"outsider\\", Reggie, an old meths drinker.Loganberry Books Douglas in The October Child often resents having to look after his younger brother Carl, whose autism has disrupted their happy family.\\"Representations of Mothers and Mothering in Contemporary Australian Children's Literature\\" by Margot Hillel in the La Trobe Journal 60, Spring 1997 In A Candle for St. Antony Justin's friendship with Rudi develops an intensity he lacks the maturity to deal with. The Seventh Pebble deals with Catholic/Protestant conflict and teen pregnancy. In Time to go Home Rowan's decision to coach an Aboriginal boy to play his beloved Rugby Union leads to trouble. Often in her books she presents the situation of the young person who is in some way an outsider in his social setting. This alienation becomes the springboard for learning to overcome difficulties and growing in self- knowledge and self-confidence. Maurice Saxby, the children's literature expert, wrote: \\"More than any other writers, Eleanor Spence and Joan Phipson have perhaps helped guide the direction of Australian children's literature in the past 30 years. They have both expressed in their novels of family life not only social changes but the concerns and preoccupations of a growingly complex Australian society.\\" Quoted in obituary Critical appraisal \\"Her fine characterizations, touches of humor, and insight into youth give Mrs. Spence's novels appeal far beyond her own land.\\"Bethlehem Books: Author Details \\"Eleanor Spence: Observer of Family Life\\" in Innocence and Experience: Essays on Contemporary Australian Children's Writers (1981), by Walter McVitty, pp 67‚Äì98.

The estate's flagship wine, Pingus, is considered a \\"cult wine\\", sold at extremely high prices while remaining very inaccessible, and commands an average price of $811 per bottle. The winery also produces a second wine, Flor de Pingus, and a special cuv√©e, Ribera del Duero \\"Amelia\\". Recently, Dominio de Pingus has founded a joint project with local grape producers to make an old vine tempranillo called \\"PSI\\". History Dominio de Pingus was established in 1995 by Danish oenologist Peter Sisseck, also manager of the Pesquera de Duero estate Hacienda Monasterio. On the estate's winemaking philosophies, Sisseck has stated, \\"The vines in my plots are very old. They have never been fertilised nor treated with pesticides and all grow following the traditional en vaso system. They are perfect.\\" About the first 1995 vintage of Pingus, Robert Parker declared, \\"One of the greatest and most exciting wines I have ever tasted\\". With a very limited first vintage production, only 325 cases were made with prices initially set at US$200 per bottle, it became yet more scarce when in November 1997 the ship transporting a U.S. bound shipment of 75 cases disappeared somewhere off the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean. The shipwreck resulted in a dramatic reaction in the US market, with prices soon rising to $495 per bottle. At the Ronda WineCreator conference of April 2008, Sisseck was angered by suggestions by Decanter editor Guy Woodward that some winemakers make wines to suit the palates of certain critics. In response he called Woodward's remarks arrogant for implying winemakers do not have their own opinions, adding, \\"I don't even think it is possible to do this.\\" In 2007 it was announced that the Spanish government had approved plans to expand highway roads through the vineyards of Dominio de Pingus and other wineries, which was met with strong opposition by Sisseck who called it a \\"vengeful measure\\". Production Planted with very old vines of Tinto Fino, i.e. Tempranillo, the vineyards are in Barrosso with vines exceeding 65 years and in San Cristobal with vines older than 70 years, and the unusually low average yield of 12 hL per hectare. Since 2000, the viticulture has been biodynamic. Of the annual production of Pingus there is typically less than 500 cases, though in poor vintages no Pingus is made. The production of the second wine Flor de Pingus, also 100% Tempranillo, is made with fruit from rented vineyards in the La Horra zone, with vines older than 35 years. Since the 2005 vintage, the viticulture has been biodynamic. The annual production is on average 4,000 cases. Additionally there has been the single barrel cuv√©e, Ribera del Duero \\"Amelia\\", made from a vineyard parcel of 100+ year old vines with an average yield of 10 hL per hectare, with biodynamic viticulture since its initial 2003 vintage. The 2005 vintage had a production of 25 cases. \\"PSI\\" is a joint project based on fruit produced by local grape growers from old tempranillo vines. The goal is to help grape producers and save old vines. Project was founded in 2006, first vintage was 2007. Grape growers are encouraged to employ biodynamic or organic vineyard management practices. The wine is made by Peter Sisseck and Pablo Rubio and sold under producer name Bodegas y Vi√±edos Alnardo. Vinification takes place in large concrete vats and aging in concrete and wooden tanks and oak barrels. Production of PSI 2009 was 9,600 cases, PSI 2010 was 16,600 cases.

His name is derived from a polyptych depicting scenes from the life of Saint Ursula painted for the convent of the Black Sisters of Bruges. The city appears in the background of a number of the paintings, in which the belfry and tower of the Church of Notre-Dame are visible. Consequently, it is possible, given the stages of construction of the belfry, to determine that the altarpiece was painted either before 1483 or somewhere between 1493 and 1499. The Netherlands Institute for Art History hold his birth and death dates to be those of Pieter Casenbroot, who was registered in the Bruges guild of saddlemakers and sculptors in 1460.Meester van de (Brugse) Legende van de Heilige Ursula in the RKD Today the panels have been dispersed to a number of museums around the world.

It is built at the Mainalo mountain, near the ruins of the ancient city Dipaia (). Its population was 70 at the 2011 census. The name of Piana is connected with the mythological god Pan (modern Greek: Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÇ), who, according to the ancient Greek mythology, had the legs of the goat under his human body. Piana belongs to the province of Mantineia and constitutes today a municipal department of the municipality of Falanthos.  Locality and access to Piana  Piana is built in sides of mountain range of Mainalo in altitude of 1090 metres and with Eastern report. The distance from Athens is roughly 190 kilometres that are covered by road in roughly two hours. Piana is found in southernly the capital of Prefecture Arkadia, that is Tripoli, and it abstains from this 19 kilometres. The access in the village becomes following the road axis Tripoli-Alonistaina-Vytina, following the bypass to the left in the 18th km, through a green forest route which crosses the evergreen region of Mainalo. In the square of Piana dominates the church of Saint Georgios. The church is built on imposing rock in the centre of village. The church of Saint Georgios is a basilica with three aisles, a dome and two splendidly stonebuild belfries. The trunke of church is from stone and during Ottoman domination, it was a castle. Piana is a member village of the municipality of Falanthos, which is a subdivision of the municipality of Tripoli since 2010.Œî. Œ¶Œ±ŒªŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÖ, EETAA local government changes It is very close to the other villages of Falanthos like Alonistaina, Chrysovitsi, Roeino, Davia, Zarakova, Mantaiika, Tselepakos and Silimna. Moreover, visitors of the very famous nearby destinations like Vitina, Stemnitsa and Dimitsana can easily visit Piana.  The role of Piana during the Greek Revolution of 1821  At the revolution of 1821 the village played decisive role due to difficulties to access. For this reason the region around Piana constituted the ideal den for the Armatoloi and Kleftes. In Piana were organised by Theodoros Kolokotronis the first military departments that strengthened the battle of Valtetsi and dominated over Turks in Tripolitsa later on. The name of Piana is historically unbreakably connected with the catering of Kolokotronis armed forces with the essentials for their winning battles. In the courtyard of another beautiful church of the village, named Panagitsa Polykammeni, because of the repeatedly Turk's efforts to ruin it with fire, it is saved today a traditional wood-oven. By the ovens of Piana the Greek camps of revolution, were provided with bread .  Limpovisi In distance of 7 kilometres of westwards Piana is found the historical Limpovisi (). It is the Homeland of Kolokotronis' Family and the natural space in which he grew during his childhood and also acted Theodoros Kolokotronis or Geros Tou Moria(). At the inventory of Enetoi() in 1711 were recorded 500 residents at Limpovisi. Nowadays at Limpovisi, the House of Kolokotronis family has been restored and functions as a museum. In the courtyard of Limpovisi also exists the country church of Ai-Yannis(). The wider space of Limpovisi was reformed with donation of the unforgettable Panagiotis Aggelopoulos in the year 1990. In the square functions also municipal refreshment stand.  Arkoudorevma  In small distance from Limpovisi, is found the depopulated village Arkoudorevma (). Arkoudorevma belonged to the community of Piana, and was abolished as a settlement in 1928.ŒëœÅŒ∫ŒøœÖŒ¥œåœÅŒµœÖŒºŒ±, EETAA local government changes Deep in the gorge of Arkoudorevma, ruins of the old Arkoudorevma houses are saved until today. Worthseeing is also the renovated stone tap of Arkoudorevma, that is found very near to the church of Virgin Mary of Arkoudorevma. The church of Virgin Mary of Arkoudorevma was built in 1719. The waters from the Arkoudorevma gorge meet with those of the Elissonas which crosses the plain of Piana. Arkoudorevma is of equal historical importance with that of Limpovisi, because his embossed territory it constituted also this place suitable for reorganization of armed forces before the historical battles of 1821.  The Folklore Museum of Piana  In the village functions the Folklore Museum of Piana with richly as much as unique exhibits. This exhibits are constituted by infrequent collections of utensiles and vessels and are related with the daily life of previous generations of Piana residents, religious and ecclesiastical heirlooms, as well as samples of martial equipment of the fighters of the Greek Revolution of 1821. The exclusive assiduity and support of this effort came solely from the Papanikolas Institution Beneficial to the Public.  The Elissonas River  The plain of Piana is crossed by the Elissonas River. The waters of Elissonas river gush from the sources of the foot of Pianovouni and it gives life to the very few residents of region that cultivate the ground or raise their animals. Important part of these sources' water of Elisson River is collected for the water supply of the residents of Tripolis, the Capital of the Arkadian prefecture. In the middle of the plain of Piana, the waters of the Elisson river are lost deep in the ground and it is believed that they do appear again in the region of Megalopolis. At length dormitory of river Elisson used to function 12 stone watermills for the grinding of cereals of the region and 6 traditional stone washing factories () for the washing of the heavy clothing. Some of these buildings are saved until our days in very good situation.  The Pianovouni Mountain and Pan  In the mountain that is found above the sources of Elisson river that called Pianovouni(), is found the cave of the god Pan. The local fable, wants Pan to live in this cave and with his flute to flood with magic sounds the marvelous ravine of the Elisson Sources. Also, the etymology of name of Piana is brought to be connected with the God Panas.  Main cultivation and the products of Piana  The main products are potatoes, walnuts, tomatoes, courgettes, cauliflowers and beans. Traditionally Piana was very famous for the high production of apples and constituted very important income for the local economy. Particularly acquaintance was the cultivated variety Delicious Pilafa Tripoleos Apples (). Today the cultivation of the apple trees has been minimized in total and just meets the needs of the Piana residents. The main causes that the culture of apple trees were abandoned, particularly the variety Pilafa Delicious, is related to the increased needs of trees in farming care as well as in not guaranteed and unstable output from year-to-year mainly due to the unfavourable meteorological conditions or the apple trees diseases. Moreover, because a very important part of the ground of Piana as well as of the wider region, is covered with firs, it is produced honey of fir of high quality () as well as the acquaintance for the flavour of Honey of Fir Mainalou Vanilla().  The Weather Conditions of Piana  The climate of Piana is mountainous. During the winter there are enough rainfalls, snowfalls and frost, while in the summertime are presented big fluctuations in the temperature of day-night.

The short ten-minute movie caused an enormous public protest in Denmark because it depicted the actual shooting of two captive lions. Synopsis Two big game hunters are on safari in the jungle with their African guide. They observe zebras, ostrich and a hippopotamus, and catch a small monkey for a pet. During the night they are awakened by a lion which kills a small goat and then the hunters' horse. The hunters shoot the lion as it stands by the water on a beach. They discover another lion and shoot it also. The lions are gutted and skinned. The happy hunters sit and smoke cigarettes afterward. Production and controversy The ten-minute \\"jungle\\" movie (215 meters of 35mm film) was actually filmed on location in Denmark. Scenes of the hunters in the forest were shot in J√¶gersborg Dyrehave park near Copenhagen. The animals were filmed at the Copenhagen Zoo with the camera aimed downward to avoid any view of the enclosures. The controversial shooting of two lions took place on the small island of Elleore in the Roskilde fjord.Casper Tyberg, \\"Teltholdernes verdensteater 1896-1909\\", 100 √Örs Danske Film, Rosinante, 2001, p.23 In the summer of 1907, Ole Olsen decorated Elleore with palm fronds and artificial plants to simulate a tropical savanna. He then bought two elderly lions from the Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg, Germany for the large sum of 5000 deutschmarks.Larsen, Lisbeth Richter, World Record Nordisk Film Centenary, Film #50, May 2006, retrieved=2008-06-22 When the Danish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals learned about Olsen's plan to shoot the lions for his movie, they protested to the Danish Minister of Justice Peter Adler Alberti. Alberti banned the filming. Two days later, however, Olsen defiantly shot the scenes as planned, then smuggled the film to Sweden. Olsen's cinematographer, Axel Graatkj√¶r, was arrested and spent a day in jail. At a court hearing, Alberti banned the movie in Denmark and revoked Olsen's license for his Biograf Theater. Aftermath In 1907, Olsen premiered The Lion Hunt in Sweden. Because of the publicity from the protests, L√∏vejagten was a huge success abroad. The following year, after the charges of animal cruelty were dropped and the Danish ban was rescinded, the film had its homeland premiere on November 11, 1908. Nordisk Film Kompagni eventually sold 259 prints of L√∏vejagten, which earned the company an enormous profit. It ushered in the \\"golden age\\" of Danish cinema when Nordisk Film became the most productive film company in Europe. A sequel to the film, Bear Hunting in Russia, was shot in 1909 and was also a profitable movie, eventually selling 118 prints. Cast and crew Viggo Larsen directed the filming as well as acted as one of the hunters. Knud Lumbye portrayed the second hunter and William Thomsen played the African guide. Axel Graatkj√¶r, who later became a favorite cinematographer of August Blom and Urban Gad, shot the film, credited under his actual name of A. S√∏rensen.

With only the foundation completed, the site became known as \\"Villard's Ruins\\" and the bodies of two murder victims were found there before construction resumed. George B.

He spent six years ministering in Pietermaritzburg; after his return to England, he became known as the \\"Rail men's Apostle\\" for his work with railway workers in Oxford. He was Vice-President, and then President, of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. He also wrote a book on the history of the church. Life Jenkins was born in Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan on 30 January 1828. His father, William David Jenkins, could allegedly trace his ancestry back to Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last Prince of Morgannwg. After attending Taliesin Williams's school in Merthyr Tydfil and Cowbridge Grammar School, Jenkins studied at Oxford University, matriculating at Jesus College in 1846 with the benefit of the Sir Leoline Jenkins scholarship. He studied Literae Humaniores, obtaining a third-class BA degree in 1850. He subsequently obtained further degrees: M.A. in 1852, BD in 1859 and DD in 1871. He became a good classical and oriental scholar whilst at Oxford, developing a fluency in modern languages in later life. Whilst an undergraduate, he tried and failed on several occasions for the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew Scholarship; after his final failure, Dr Pusey presented him with some books to acknowledge his abilities in Hebrew. Jenkin's rich personal library was presented to Llandaff Cathedral, where it remained in the Prebendal House for over a century until the recent dispersal of the cathedral library to provide funds for a refurbished organ. He was appointed as a Fellow of Jesus College in 1851/2, retaining this position until his death. The fellowship was a King James II Missionary Fellowship, under the terms of which Jenkins was required to become ordained and \\"proceed to such one of Her Majesty's plantations as the Bishop of London, for the time being, might appoint.\\" He was ordained deacon in 1851 by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, and appointed curate to the Reverend Alfred Hackman at St Paul's Church, Oxford. St Paul's was a noted Tractarian church. Whilst Jenkins was at St Paul's, Thomas Combe commissioned Holman Hunt to paint Jenkins's portrait. In accordance with the terms of the fellowship, Jenkins went to the Cape of Good Hope, arriving in November 1852. Bishop Robert Gray, the bishop of Cape Town, sent him to Pietermaritzburg under the direction of the rector, the Reverend James Green. Jenkins remained in Pietermaritzburg for six years, working particularly with the armed forces as Chaplain to the 45th Regiment and Battery of Field Artillery. He soon became involved in controversy when Green, Jenkins and others opposed Bishop John Colenso, the first Bishop of Natal, who had questioned the literal accuracy of some biblical passages based on his own mathematical calculations, and had also condemned ritualistic practices (particularly the wearing of \\"gorgeous coloured vestments\\") favoured by the Tractarians. Bishop Gray attempted to relieve Bishop Colenso of his position at a court hearing in which he sat in judgment. Colenso, however, refused to attend at the hearing and subsequently succeeded in his application to the Privy Council for an order that the Bishop Gray's judgment had been illegal. Following the Privy Council judgment Colenso returned to Natal. Bishop Colenso made Jenkins a canon of Pietermaritzburg in 1856. Ill-health (the early stages of liver cancer) caused Jenkins to leave South Africa in 1858 and return to Oxford. He became Dean of Jesus College in 1865, and Junior Bursar in 1866. Jenkins then wrote a book on the history of the Christian Church. The Age of the Martyrs, the first volume of the work, was published in 1869 and was dedicated by Jenkins to Green. It was translated into Welsh in 1890. The rest of the book was not published. In March 1870, Jenkins was appointed vicar of Aberdare, Glamorgan, by the Marquess of Bute. He died of liver cancer in Aberdare on 9 November 1876. Ministry Jenkins's \\"abiding compassion for the less fortunate\\", as it has been termed, was first demonstrated with his work with the army in South Africa, where one of his contemporaries said that \\"his influence for good was boundless\\". After his return to Oxford, he became involved with the Society of the Holy Cross, an Anglo-Catholic clerical organisation founded by Pusey and others. Its principles included missionary work amongst the poor. Jenkins spent considerable amounts of time in the 1860s ministering to sick and poor railway workers and their families. He was a clerical superior in the \\"Railway Guild of the Holy Cross\\", which promoted Christian faith amongst railway employees. His commitment to the task of ministering to railway families led to him becoming known as the \\"Rail men's Apostle\\". After his appointment to Aberdare, a town where Dissenters were strong, Jenkins organised choral services with psalms being sung to Anglican chants and the canticles to Gregorian chants. He worked with Nonconformists to promote local friendly societies and was sufficiently well-regarded to be presented in 1874 with a testimonial noting \\"his genial and affectionate regard for the hardworking and humbler classes of society\\" and his involvement with the South Wales Choral Union, which had won a national competition at The Crystal Palace in 1872. He also represented the views of miners during strikes, sometimes clashing with employers as a result. His involvement with railway matters did not cease on his appointment to Aberdare. When the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants was established in 1872, he was appointed Vice-President. He helped form an Aberdare branch, and addressed meetings at local and national level, stressing the need for unity amongst the workers and the importance of providing for sickness and old-age whilst in good health. In 1873, Jenkins was unanimously elected President and held the position until his death in 1876. The ASRS paid for a memorial window at St Elven's Church, Aberdare, in his honour. At his funeral, conducted by his college friend Griffith Arthur Jones, the union's general secretary, Fred Evans, said: Jenkins also played a conciliatory role in the mining disputes which became increasingly prevalent in the Aberdare Valley during the 1870s. At a meeting in early 1872, addressed by miners' leaders Alexander Macdonald and Thomas Halliday, he was called to the platform by the chairman of the meeting, Henry Thomas, to great cheering. Portrait The portrait of Jenkins by Holman Hunt from 1852 commissioned by Thomas Combe, entitled New College Cloisters, now hangs in the Senior Common Room at Jesus College. The robes worn by Jenkins are those of a High Church priest, including black silk worn over the surplice (a revival of a pre-Reformation tradition). The setting, the cloisters of New College, Oxford, has been said to give \\"monastic undertones\\" to the picture, with the overall effect that \\"suggested a Gothic feel wholly in keeping with contemporary Tractarian philosophy\\" - Hunt and Jenkins both being supporters of the Oxford Movement.

One of his brothers, Sultan Qiassuddin, was Wali-e-Tanawal, and the Wali-e-Upper Tanawal was Sultan Sahwaj. His brother, Sultan Muqarrab, was Wali-e-Dhamtor. History Sultan Maqarrab revolted against Sultan Mehmud Khud, and was defeated by the Delhi Sultanate. This incident weakened the Turks. Pakhli had two important governments: one between Battagram and Thakot ruled by Shamsher Khan and the other of Kashmir was ruled by Sultan Kamal. Both of the rulers were close relatives of Turkish rulers of Pakhli. In 1713, Sultan Khurd went to Delhi. One of the Sultan's daughters was married to Syed Jalal Baba, who took advantage of Khurd's absence to invite the Swatis to invade Pakhli. The conspiracy succeeded. Shamsher Khan, a general loyal to Khurd, resisted at the Jhanjal fort of Thakot. After a siege of several months, Baba's forces defeated Shamsher Khan, who was killed in combat. After the fall of Jhanjer, there was no resistance; due to the ages of the Sultan's sons and the conspiracy of Baba, the Turks could not offer resistance. Swatis entered Hazara, pushing the Turks into the areas of Hazara and Kashmir. The Turks retained small jagirs and have never been fully eliminated from the locations. They settled in Behali of the Mansehra District, and in Mankrai of the Haripur District. Pakhli was the only state in India which retained its independence; Mughals exempted the citizens from paying taxes.

Description  Melibe leonina from Santa Cruz, California. The body of M. leonina is translucent and is usually colorless to pale yellow or green. The average body dimensions are 102mm long and 25mm wide. It has a large expandable oral hood, fringed with two rows of cirri. The oral hood is typically over 51mm wide. This species of Melibe lacks jaws or a radula. There are a single pair of rhinophores on the hood that contain four to six lamellae. Two rows containing three to six pairs of flat, paddle-shaped cerata run along the body. The cerata range in size, with the front most cerata being the largest. Cerata are capable of autotomy. The anus and nephroproct are positioned before the second ceras. All other members of the genus Melibe contain chitinous plates in the stomach, however, they are absent in M. leonina.  Distribution  This species occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Baja California. M. leonina is the only member of the genus Melibe found on the Pacific coast of North America.  Ecology  = Habitat = Melibe leonina in kelp forest. M. leonina are common on seagrass and blades of Macrocystis kelp within their range, from the lower intertidal to approximately 37m. = Reproduction = M. leonina is a simultaneous hermaphrodite, with its female and male reproductive organs located on the right side of the body. Fertilization occurs internally, and individuals can lay up to 30,000 eggs at a time. Mating has only been observed during the day. = Feeding habits = Melibe leonina in aquaria. While most nudibranchs are predators of sessile benthic organisms, M. leonina feeds on planktonic invertebrates. M. leonina is carnivorous and has been observed eating several types of planktonic crustaceans, including amphipods, copepods, ostracods, and various types of larvae. M. leonina lack any features associated with chewing, so prey are swallowed whole. M. leonina have been observed displaying feeding behavior even in the complete absence of food. Adults and juveniles display different feeding behaviors, however, they both feed by first attaching their foot firmly to its substratum. Adults feed by pulling back their oral hood until it is almost perpendicular to the body, and then thrust it forward until contact is made with a prey organism. Once prey has been contacted, the hood closes and the rows of cirri interlock to prevent escape. The hood is compressed further, pushing excess water out and forcing the prey towards the mouth. Closing the oral hood takes approximately 4 seconds. In aquarium settings, M. leonina have been observed exhibiting different feeding strategies, including surface floating and bottom grazing. Juveniles start with their hood nearly parallel to their substratum. As they move their body forward, they bring their hood down until it makes contact with the substratum. Water is pushed from the hood once contact has been made with the substratum, and prey is forced towards the mouth. Researchers believe that the differences in feeding behaviors indicate that adults feed from the water and juveniles feed directly from the substratum. Juveniles feed during the day or night, while adults feed exclusively at night. = Predators = There have been very few observations of predation on M. leonina; the few known observations of predation have mostly involved the crab Pugettia producta. The main defense against predation is thought to be its ability to produce an odorous secretion that is repellent to other organisms. The gland that produces these secretions are known as repugnatorial glands. Some sources have described the secretion as a watermelon-like smell. = Locomotion = M. leonina are capable swimmers, however, they have rarely been observed leaving their substratum. M. leonina swim through a behavior known as lateral bending. Individuals swim by first closing their oral hood and releasing themselves from their substrate. Next, they curl their foot and extend their cerrata. They then flatten their body laterally, to create more surface area. To propel themselves forward they bend their body from side to side, forming a \\"C\\" shape. M. leonina are capable of trapping air in their hood for buoyancy. Studies have shown that M. leonina individuals regularly move to other kelp blades, but have rarely been observed swimming during the day in nature. This has led researchers to speculate that M. leonina swim mostly at night. Experiments in a laboratory setting have supported this theory; showing that on average M. leonina swim 20 times more often at night.  References  External links * Joseph L. Sevigny, Lauren E.

It is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean where it lives on the seabed at depths down to about between Alaska and California. Description Solitary, sessile tunicate. Incurrent and excurrent siphons directed upwards, away from substratum. Without dorsal nerve cord as adult. Identification Solitary ascidians (not reproducing by budding), but not embedded in a common tunic. Individual is usually more than 1 cm in diameter. Tunic transparent or translucent. Attached to a firm substratum. Body is taller than wide. Oral and atrial siphons about the same length. Tunic smooth or irregularly wrinkled. Body not much taller than wide; tunic transparent and colorless; longitudinal muscle bands not obvious beneath the tunic; oral and atrial apertures not borne on distinct siphons. Rectum more than three-fourths the height of the body; atrium not expanded into a pocket in which embryos are brooded. Reproduction and Development Hermaphroditic; Corella willmeriana breeds throughout the year. The eggs are fertilized in the atrial chamber, where they develop into the free-swimming tadpole stage before released. Swimming larvae remain juveniles for <2 days before anterior adhesive organs allow for attachment to substratum. This triggers metamorphism, which entails enlargement of pharynx for filter feeding; the notochord is sucked back into body and is no longer present in adult form. Predation and Other Threats Eurylepta leoparda, a cotylean polyclad flatworm, rolls up into a tube and enters C. willmeriana through the oral aperture. It unrolls itself and ingests the branchial basket. It then either leaves the individual through a siphon or continues to feed on the remainder of the internal organs. Other flatworms and polychaetes have been found to eat C. willmeriana. Very young C. willmeriana are frequently overgrown during the winter by colonial ascidian Diplosoma madconaldi. Diatom blooms in springtime sometimes smother adult C. willmeriana. Range and Ecology Pacific Ocean from southern Alaska to southern California. Subtidal to 75 m. Often found in fouling communities. It is a primary colonizer, as the tadpoles have demonstrated preference to settle on clean, unfouled surfaces. Synonyms Transparent tunicate, transparent sea squirt, solitary tunicate.

The shell is quite variable in color and patterning, being cream-colored to gray with concentric lines or patches. Individuals living in anoxic conditions may be black. The inside surface of the shell is often white with purple edges. The siphons are separated at the tips.Carlton, J. T. (Ed.) (2007). The Light and Smith Manual: Intertidal Invertebrates from Central California to Oregon. University of California Press. Distribution This clam is native to the coasts of the Indian, Philippines and Pacific Oceans from Pakistan and India north to China, Japan, Korea and the Kuril Islands.Ruditapes philippinarum. Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, FAO. 2017. It has a very wide nonnative distribution, having been introduced accidentally and purposely as a commercially harvested edible clam. It is now permanently established in coastal ecosystems in many parts of the world. It is common along the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia to California, where its original introduction was accidental. It can be found in Hawaii. It was first seeded in the waters of Europe in the 1970s, and there have been multiple introductions throughout the region. It has spread naturally in Western Europe over the decades, its adaptability allowing it to thrive in many coastal habitat types. It has been planted in Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Morocco, Israel, and French Polynesia for the purposes of aquaculture. Habitat This burrowing clam is most abundant in subtropical and cooler temperate areas. It can be found in shallow waters in substrates of coarse sand, mud, and gravel. It lives in the littoral and sublittoral zones.Palomares, M. L. D. and D. Pauly (Eds.) Ruditapes philippinarum. SeaLifeBase. Version February 2017. It burrows no more than about 10 centimeters into the substrate. It sometimes lives in eelgrass beds. This species lives in many types of habitat, being found in the intertidal zone, brackish waters, estuaries, and under ice. It survives in a range of salinities and temperatures, with narrower ranges required for breeding. Biology and ecology Miso soup made of Japanese littleneck clams (Asari). This clam may become sexually mature in its first year of life, when it reaches about 15 millimeters in width, especially in warmer areas such as Hawaii. In cooler areas it begins breeding at older ages and larger sizes. In warmer regions it spawns year-round, but only in the summer in cooler areas. The fecundity of the species increases with size, a 40-millimeter female producing up to 2.4 million eggs. The larva, a trochophore, begins to develop a shell 2 days after it hatches from the egg. Within 2 weeks it settles onto a hard substrate, attaches to it with a byssus, and eventually burrows into the sediment. Its maximum life span is about 13 to 14 years. The clam filter-feeds through its siphon, taking mostly phytoplankton, with adults preferring microalgae such as diatoms. It may be an opportunistic feeder, its diet varying according to what is available in its wide range of habitat types. This species is a nutritious and attractive prey item for many kinds of predatory animals, including the green crab, moon snails, starfish, fish, ducks, shorebirds, sea otters, and raccoons. It is a host species for the copepod Mytilicola orientalis, a parasite of mussels which is known as a pest in aquaculture operations. This clam has had negative impacts on native ecosystems in some regions, mainly due to its ability to grow in high densities.Study: Non-native Manila clam has established in Mission Bay, San Diego. Sea Grant California. 30 March 2015. Its populations can begin filter- feeding at such rates that they can alter local food webs. It can hybridize with the grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus), a phenomenon that has led to introgression. Commercial value This species represents 25% of commercially produced mollusks in the world. This clam is considered to be a sustainable aquaculture product.Manila Clam.

It convened on August 18 to consider the draft constitution written earlier, completed its deliberations rewriting the constitution on November 15,Bakhash, Reign of the Ayatollah's (1984) p.83 and claimed the constitution it had written approved by referendum on December 2Assembly of Experts and 3, 1979, by a majority of the voters who participated, History of Iran: Iran after the victory of 1979's Revolution but there is no reliable document for that. History Prior to its election a \\"Revolutionary council\\" had unveiled a draft constitution on June 18 which was written by Hasan Habibi. Aside from substituting a strong president, on the Gaullist model, for the monarchy, the constitution did not differ markedly from Iran's 1906 constitution and did not give the clerics an important role in the new state structure. Ayatollah Khomeini was prepared to submit this draft, virtually unmodified, to a national referendum or, barring that, to an appointed council of forty representatives who could advise on, but not revise, the document. Ironically, as it turned out, it was the leftist who most vehemently rejected this procedure and demanded that the constitution be submitted for full-scale review by a constituent assembly. Ayatollah Shariatmadari supported these demands. Composition According to Shaul Bakhash, the seventy-three-member Assembly of Experts was made up of 55 clerics, 50 of whom were candidates of the Islamic Republic Party (IRP). About a dozen members were independents or represented other parties and voted against the controversial articles of the constitution.Bakhash, Reign of the Ayatollah's (1984) p.81 According to Sepehr Zabir, pro-IRP faction were 50% while 10% were better-known clerics such as Mahmoud Taleghani who were closer secular groupings. 20% were non-clerics embracing theocracy and the remaining 20% were followers of Abolhassan Banisadr and Mehdi Bazargan. Organizations such as the National Front, People's Fedai Guerrillas and People's Mujahedin of Iran were totally absent. A seat of Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou of Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan remained vacant after his credential was rejected. The controversial articles in question were ones that revamped the draft constitution to include principles of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists (velayat-e faqih) and establish the basis for a state dominated by the Shia clergy. The article was passed with 53 votes in favor, while 8 cast votes against and 5 abstained. Members of the opposition bloc were reportedly the following: *Abolhassan Banisadr *Mahmoud Taleghani *Ezzatollah Sahabi *Ali Golzadeh Ghafouri *Nasser Makarem Shirazi *Ahmad Nourbakhsh *Rahmatollah Moghaddam Maraghei *Hamidollah Mir-Moradzehi *Mohammad-Javad Hojjati Kermani Representatives of ethnoreligious minorities are also likely to have voted with the opposition. They were: *Hrair Khalatian (Armenian) *Sergen Bait Ushana (Assyrian) *Aziz Daneshrad (Jewish) *Rostam Shahzadi (Zoroastrian) Goal The assembly's work was part of a highly contentious time during the Iranian Revolution that saw the breakup of the original alliance of secular, radical, religious, and theocratic groups that all united to overthrow the Shah.Schirazi, Constitution of Iran (1997) p.31-32Keddie, Modern Iran (2003) p.247Schirazi, Constitution of Iran (1997) p.24-48 It was to the Assembly that Khomeini proclaimed \\"the velayat-e faqih is not something created by the Assembly of Experts. It is something that God has ordained,\\" International Herald Tribune, 24, October 1979 which clashed with comments such as, \\"our intention is not that religious leaders should themselves administer the state,\\" from Le Monde newspaper October 25, 1978, \\"in one of his last interviews before leaving Paris,\\" p.14 of The Last Revolution by Robin Wright, c2000) (source: Benard and Khalilzad, The Government of God) made before the victory of the revolution.

The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was set up in Moscow. Many thousands of Jewish refugees fled the Nazis and entered the Soviet Union during the war, where they reinvigorated Jewish religious activities and opened new synagogues. From late 1944, Stalin adopted an openly pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would speed the decline of British influence in the Middle East.Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews (1987) p.527 In May 1947 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko told the United Nations that the USSR supported the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.

These relations were severed by the Soviet government in June 1967, in protest of Israeli policy during the Six Day War and immediately after. The Soviet Union supported Israel's Arab enemies with arms and training, and Soviet forces were deployed to Egypt during the War of Attrition, where they repeatedly engaged Israeli forces. After the Soviet Union cut off diplomatic relations with Israel due to the Six-Day War, the Dutch Embassy in Moscow established an Israel interests' section which represented Israel in the Soviet Union until diplomatic relations were reestablished in January 1991.\\"They did not dwell alone.

After the Soviet Union collapsed two months later, he continued to serve as Russia's ambassador to Israel. The dissolution of the Soviet Union caused a very large immigration wave of Jews from Soviet states. Due to demand from the new immigrants, many Russian language newspapers appeared, and with the development of the multichannel television in Israel during the 1990s, many Russian channels started being rebroadcast in Israel. In November 2002, a new Israeli-Russian channel, Israel Plus, emerged.

Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov subsequently said that if he was an Israeli, he would vote for incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the 1999 Israeli general election. 2000s The relationship between Israel and Russia only substantially began to improve in 2000, with the election of the more pro- Israel Vladimir Putin, and in 2001 with election of the more pro-Russian Ariel Sharon, who described Putin as \\"a true friend of Israel\\". In 2006, Israeli troops found evidence of Russian made Kornet-E and Metis-M anti-tank systems in Hezbollah's possession in southern Lebanon. In 2007, in response to accusations that it was supplying terrorist groups with weapons, Russia said it was conducting inspections of Syrian weapons storage facilities to prevent the weapons from reaching unintended customers. This strained the already- deteriorating relations between Russia and Israel. In 2006, Vladimir Zhirinovsky visiting as part of a government delegation said that he was concerned particularly about the economic situation for the more than one million Russians living in Israel, and that \\"Russia will never allow any kind of violence against Israel\\".–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π: —è ‚Äì –Ω–µ \\"—Å—ã–Ω —é—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞\\". –†–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± –æ—Ç—Ü–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏: 25 –∏—é–Ω—è 2006 –≥, Newsru.co.il–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –≤ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª–µ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –æ–± –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–∏–∑–º–µ –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ 25 —Ñ–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—è 2014 –≥., 21:14, NewsRU.co.il Russia planned to sell advanced surface-to-air missiles to neighboring countries, and condemned Israel's actions in the Gaza War.Israel Kills at least 225 and wounded 700 People in Gaza, 28 December 2008 Sunday 2:5 .Turkishweekly.net.

It is practically a Russian-speaking country. Israel is one of the few foreign countries that can be called Russian- speaking. It's apparent that more than half of the population speaks Russian\\". Putin additionally claimed that Israel could be considered part of the Russian cultural world, and contended that \\"songs which are considered to be national Israeli songs in Israel are in fact Russian national songs\\". He further stated that he regarded Russian-speaking Israeli citizens as his compatriots and part of the 'Russian world'.DIASPORA & CITIZENSHIP, by Claire Sutherland, Elena Barabantseva, (Routledge 2013), page 88 In April 2014, Israel took a neutral stance on the Russian annexation of Crimea at the United Nations, angering U.S. State Department and White House officials. During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, Putin stated that \\"I support Israel's battle that is intended to keep its citizens protected\\".https://fjc.ru/president-putin-support-israel/ In August 2014, Russia began increasing fruit imports from Israel, after banning food imports from the EU, Norway, United States, Canada and Australia. In October 2014, India and Israel started to export meat to Russia. Relations between Israel and Russia further improved after the Russian military intervention in Syria in September 2015. From then until July 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Putin met a total of 9 times. In October 2015, Israel and Russia held meetings to coordinate over Syria, and avoid accidentally clashing or scrambling each other's communications while operating over the country.Netanyahu says ties with Russia good, doesn't join criticism of Syria attacks i24 News, 4 October 2015Russia-Israel Military Coordination Talks to Open Tuesday Reuters, 6 October 2015 In March 2016, Putin said the relations with Israel were special and based \\"on friendship, mutual understanding and the long common history\\". Putin stated: \\"Russia and Israel have developed a special relationship. 1.5 million Israeli citizens come from the former Soviet Union, they speak the Russian language, are the bearers of Russian culture, Russian mentality. They maintain relations with their relatives and friends in Russia, and this make the interstate relations very special\\".Putin says he plans to meet Israeli prime minister soon 16 March, Tass In a meeting with Netanyahu in June 2016, Putin described Israel and Russia as \\"unconditional allies\\" in \\"efforts to counter international terrorism\\". Prior to and immediately after the 2016 United States presidential election, Israel began lobbying the United States to strike a deal with Russia over restricting the Iranian military presence in Syria in exchange for removing sanctions over Russian military action in Ukraine. Donald Trump was reportedly a favorite candidate for both Russia and Israel, as Trump is widely seen, by both, as a strong supporter for Israel yet friendly to Russia. Both Israel and Russia are still being accused for meddling in 2016 U.S. Election on helping Trump to power, with Vladimir Putin is found to have exclusive influence on Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump's political decisions in Israel and the United States. In December 2016, Netanyahu instructed Israel's UN delegation to skip a General Assembly vote on war crimes committed in Syria, under diplomatic pressure from Russia. The following day, Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin proposed postponing a vote on Security Council Resolution 2334 to condemn Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank until after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, in order to allow the new U.S. administration a say on the resolution, but this was rejected by other Security Council members. In January 2017, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Israel and Russia were \\"working closely\\" together in an attempt to stop the extradition of dual Russian-Israeli citizen Alexander Lapshin from Belarus to Azerbaijan.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/russia- will-act-to-prevent-extradition-of-israeli-blogger-1.5486919 In March 2018, Israel declined to attribute the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal to Russia in its statement on the matter and refused to expel any Russian diplomats, drawing criticism from the United Kingdom. In May 2018, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman stated the Israeli government had opposed sanctions on Russia despite foreign pressure to support them. At the 2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States summit in July 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin agreed to cooperate in Syria to ensure Israel's security. U.S. National Security Advisor John R. Bolton later claimed that both Israel and Russia sought the withdrawal of Iranian forces from Syria. Russia later offered to create a 100 kilometre buffer zone on the Syrian side of the Israel-Syria border which Iranian troops would be barred from, though this offer was rejected by Israel. Jewish Red Army veterans in Jerusalem during the Victory Day on 9 May 2017 In September 2018, relations somewhat deteriorated after the Russian Defense Ministry blamed the Israeli military for the downing of a Russian plane after putting it in the path of Syrian air defence systems during an Israeli strike on Hezbollah targets in Syria. Although Putin initially absolved Israel, Russia subsequently upgraded Syrian air defences to the S-300 missile system over Israeli objections, refused Israeli offers to send a delegation to Moscow to resolve the dispute, and ignored attempts by the Israeli Prime Minister's Office to set up a meeting with Putin. In December 2018, Russia backed Israel's security concerns over Hezbollah tunnels dug under the Israel-Lebanon border, urging Lebanon to resolve the issue. On 25 December 2018, Russia condemned an Israeli airstrike on a Syrian arms depot, claiming that the \\"provocative actions of the Israeli air force... directly threatened two airliners.\\" On 7 February 2019, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister urged Israel to cease its airstrikes in Syria. Relations were repaired after a meeting between Putin and Netanyahu in Moscow on 29 February 2019, after which Netanyahu announced Russian support for removing Iranian fighters from Syria, and that Putin had accepted his offer to visit Jerusalem. On 3 March 2019, Netanyahu announced the establishment of a joint Israeli-Russian team to pursue the withdrawal of all foreign troops deployed in Syria. On 18 March 2019, Putin suggested inviting Netanyahu to Crimea for the opening of a new synagogue there. Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2018 During the period preceding the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, Shin Bet chief Nadav Argaman warned that an unnamed foreign country was planning to interfere in the election, with media speculation focusing on Russia. Russia denied the reports, with Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov stating that it was \\"out of the question\\" and suggesting \\"to not read the Israeli media\\". Benny Gantz and Tamar Zandberg, the leaders of the opposition parties Blue and White and Meretz respectively, subsequently accused Russia of favouring Netanyahu. Relations improved after 4 April 2019, when Netanyahu again travelled to Moscow to meet Putin. Putin returned the remains of IDF soldier Zechariah Baumel, which had been recovered by Russian troops in Syria. Netanyahu subsequently thanked Putin for their \\"personal friendship\\", while Putin expressed his appreciation for the Israeli policy of honouring Red Army soldiers who fought in World War II. Netanyahu also specifically praised the Russian defense ministry, despite its criticisms of Israel following the downing of a Russian plane the year prior, for its contribution to the retrieval of Baumel's remains, which Netanyahu said Israel would \\"never forget\\". On 25 June 2019, Israel convened its first trilateral summit between its national security adviser and his respective American and Russian counterparts, specifically focusing on the Iranian military presence in Syria. In October 2019, Russia arrested Israeli national, Naama Issachar for alleged drug smuggling. Issachar's family and Israeli officials claimed that Russia had told them she could be released if Aleksei Burkov, a Russian national pending extradition from Israel to the United States, was released to Russia. Netanyahu subsequently personally requested a pardon for Issachar from Putin, which Putin said he would consider. Israel's High Court ultimately rejected Burkov's appeal against his extradition, leading Russia to condemn the decision as \\"a breach ... of Israel's international obligations\\", claiming that the decision \\"does not contribute to the development of [Russian-Israeli] relations\\". On 29 January 2020, President Putin signed her pardon. Her attorney previously noted that no convicted foreigner was ever pardoned by a Russian President before. 2020s On 10 January 2020, Israel released two Syrian prisoners, including one convicted of espionage, as part of a \\"gesture of goodwill\\" in a deal brokered by Russia. On 15 January 2020, an Asia Times report cited an Israeli foreign ministry official as stating that Russia expected Israeli diplomatic assistance in ending Western sanctions on the Syrian government in return for permitting the continuation of Israeli airstrikes in Syria. According from the Times of Israel, an Israeli organization, Hadassah, was involved in an effort which led to Russia's development of vaccine during the COVID-19 outbreak, shortly after Putin declared Russia was the first country to produce successful anti-COVID vaccine.https://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-hadassah-says-its-involved-in- development-of-russian-covid-19-vaccine/ In August 2020, following the normalization of Israel‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates relations, Russia was one of the earliest nations to congratulate the efforts by Israel to normalize the relations.https://iz.ru/1048328/2020-08-14/v-mid-rossii-vydelili-kliuchevoi- element-soglasheniia-izrailia-i-oae  Expatriate communities  = Russian language in Israel = States in which Russian is an official, semi-official, and working language.

The courthouse houses the chambers and courtrooms for the judge of the Circuit Court for Caroline County, as well as the clerk's offices, jurors' assembly room, the Office of the State's Attorney for Caroline County, the Register of Wills and the master's office. History After Caroline County, Maryland, was established in 1773, it held its early courts at seven different locations until 1797 when its first courthouse was built on the same site where the current courthouse now stands, an area once known as Pig Point. The courthouse green was purchased in 1791 for 121 shillings. The building served the County for one hundred years and there were many changes during this period.100px Even with the changes, vaults that stored records were overflowing and in 1894, the Caroline County commissioners asked for and received authority to raze the old courthouse and build a new one. The current courthouse was built in 1895 at the cost of $21,000 and was extensively renovated in 1966. Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to Caroline County in 1938. He spoke in front of the courthouse in Denton on Labor Day. The speech was broadcast on radio to the rest of the country. Roosevelt was there to support his New Deal programs and also to win votes for his ally in Congress, Maryland Representative T. Alan Goldsborough. Goldsborough would lose the election to Millard Tydings, but nonetheless it was an event the county would not soon forget.

Master of Arguis.The Master of Arguis was an Aragonese artist active in the first half of the 15th century. Stylistically, his work is related to that of Juan de Levi and Bonanat Zaortiga, and is derived from the tradition of the International Gothic in Aragon. His name is derived from a retable of Saint Michael dating to about 1440, now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid; this was once the main altarpiece of the church of Arguis. The painting depicts the victory of Michael over the Antichrist, and focuses primarily on the latter figure, pierced with a lance. Included in the scene are various secular figures, including kings and noblemen, as well as religious figures. At the bottom of the image may be seen a papal tiara and sceptre, symbols of the power the Antichrist claims to wield as the new Messiah. Two other paintings, both dedicated to Saint Anne, are attributed to the Master; one is in Barcelona, while the other, a small triptych, is in the collegiate church of Alquezar.

Zarghami was Deputy of Minister in Culture and Islamic Ministry as well as Defence Ministry before holding office as the head of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting from 2004 to 2014.  Early life  Zarghami was born into a religious family in 1959. Despite his father never purchasing a television, Zarghami became a cinephile. While in high school, he was the classmate of Hassan Tehrani-Moghaddam, who is widely regarded as the father of Iran's domestic ballistic missile program: Tehrani-Moghaddam was killed in 2011. At the time of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Zarghami was a 20-year-old student in the civil engineering program at Amirkabir University. He took part in the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, which ultimately lad to the severing of US-Iranian diplomatic relations. He eventually joined the newly-formed IRGC as a radio anchor during the Iran-Iraq War.  Career  For part of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Zarghami was in charge of teams tasked with the domestic production of missiles, a necessity due to many countries' refusal to sell weapons to Iran. Zarghami eventually departed from the IRGC as the rank of general; he has cited his interest in politics as his motivation for leaving. In 1995, he became deputy cultural minister overseeing cinematic affairs; he held the post for two years, during which he implemented tough restrictions on content, despite the distaste of many cinema activists. During this time, President Hashemi Rafsanjani distanced himself from Zarghami. Contradicting his harsh tenure, he has claimed to have 'paved the way' for artists in Iran. In 2004, Supreme Leader Ali Khamemei appointed him to head of the state broadcasting service, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), a post that he held for ten years. His predecessor was Ali Larijani. Throughout Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, Zarghami was accused of covering events in a biased manner. Zarghami developed a close relationship with Ahmadinejad, which he has maintained; Zarghami accompanied the then-president Ahmadinejad on his trip to the United Nations General Assembly in 2010, and the two often took phone calls with one another during the latter's term in office. After the 2009 Presidential Elections protests, many blamed Zarghami and the IRIB's biased coverage for provoking reformists to mobilize. His tenure ended in 2014, after which he became more of an active presence on social media platforms; he held meeting with controversial Iranian politicians from the left and right, portraying himself as an \\"inclusive politician\\". =Controversy= Zarghami, among other 16 Iranian Officials, was sanctioned by the European Union on 23 March 2012 \\"for committing human rights abuses.\\" As per Executive Order 13628, Zarghami was sanctioned by the US under the category \\"Entities Designated as Human Rights Abusers or Limiting Free Expression\\" in February 2013. He was also criticized for allegedly trying to prevent Iranian President Hassan Rouhani from appearing on his network for a scheduled interview in February 2014. The allegations stemmed from Rouhani and Zarghami's disagreement over whom the interviewer for Rouhani's televised address on his first 100 days in office would be, resulting in an hour delay of the program. Ezatollah Zarghami speaking at 14th Moghavemat International Film Festival Zarghami got into an argument with President Rouhani at a meeting of the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, in which he accused Rouhani of making remarks that were \\"against Islamic and revolutionary values.\\"  2017 Election  On 15 March 2017, Zarghami announced his candidacy for 2017 Iranian presidential election via his social media accounts. He said he \\"has felt the responsibility to fix the country‚Äôs management structure on a macro scale\\", accepting \\"the invitation of the Popular Front of Islamic Revolution Forces\\". Zarghami who was speculated as a potential candidate since late 2014, denied the possibility of his own candidacy in November 2015.  2021 Election  Zarghami announced his candidacy for the 2021 election during an interview with Arman Newspaper, stating that \\"I have come to the conclusion that elections, in general, are a pain in the neck\\". Many speculate that Zarghami sides with Supreme Leader Khamenei, seeking to abolish the position of Presidency in Iran in favor of a more heavily parliamentary system.

Malaysia also joined the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics as part of their opposition of the invasion of a fellow Islamic country. Throughout the Cold War, relations between Malaysia and the Soviet Union were tense over the latter's role in the Vietnam War and Soviet intervention in the Indian Ocean, which Malaysia felt could lead to the fulfillment of the domino theory, as the nation struggled with three communists insurgency itself; the Malayan Emergency, Second Malayan Emergency and the Sarawak Communist Insurgency. However, relations between the two recovered following the end of the Soviet- Afghan war, and both countries worked to repair diplomatic, economic, and military ties under Mikhail Gorbachev and Mahathir Mohamad. Several Malaysian Prime Ministers have made official visits to Moscow throughout the Cold War, including Tun Abdul Razak in 1972, Tun Hussein Onn in 1979 and Mahathir Mohamad in 1985 and 1987. Diplomatic relations between Malaysia and the Soviet Union were maintained until the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. = Modern Russia = Malaysian embassy in Moscow. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation in Russia in 2012. In the modern times, several visits have been made between leaders of respective countries. Tuanku Ja'afar, the then-Yang di-Pertuan Agong, or King of Malaysia made an unofficial visit to St. Petersburg in May 1997. In 1999, Mahathir made a working visit to the Russian regions of Khabarovsk Krai and Buryatia. Another visit by Mahathir to Moscow was made in 2002. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC Summits) in Brunei (November 2000) and Shanghai (October 2001) and Group of Eight (G8 Summit) in Evian (June 2003), there were informal meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir. Putin visited Malaysia twice in 2003 (one as an official visit in August) and to attend the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Summit in October. During his official visit, Putin conferred the Order of Friendship to Mahathir in recognition of his contribution to strengthening the friendly ties between the two countries and to the cause of global stability and inter-religious accord while a contract was signed to supply the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) with 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter aircraft. Another visit from Malaysia was made by Tuanku Sirajuddin in September 2005. Putin participated in the first Russia-ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur and had a bilateral meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in December 2005. Abdullah later made an official visit to Moscow in June 2007. Mahathir considered Russia to become a future rival to the United States and Israel and praised Putin for criticizing and standing up to American and Western interference in other sovereign states. In 2012, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak met Putin during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Russia to expand trade relations and to discover other opportunities for business partnership. Another meeting was held in 2016 with the intention to expand trade, including establishing direct flights and exploring a free trade agreement (FTA) to enhance bilateral trade and tourist arrivals. On early August 2019 the Russian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur was one of those affected by two online bomb threats which were posted on Twitter; the other being KL Sentral which is the capital city's transport hub. The aforementioned threats were posted via a hacked account by an individual calling himself \\"limzhengyan\\"; as a result the Malaysian police has carried out a search on those locations and determined that the threats were phony, although incidentally on the same day an incomplete improvised explosive device was found at the Bukit Damansara area.  Economic relations  In 2012, around 40,000 Russian tourists visited Malaysia, and the Malaysian government expressed its intent to further increase the number of Russian tourists through the establishment of direct flights between the two countries. Trade between the two countries in 2016 valued around US$2.2 billion. On 15 March 2016, a Russian-Malaysian business council was established with the intent to strengthen cooperation on economic, scientific, technological issues and culture.  Security relations and collaboration in science field  On 19 May 2007, Allahyarham Jamaluddin Jarjis then Malaysia's Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation announced that two Malaysian candidates for astronauts (Faiz Khaleed and Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor) will undergo training in Moscow as part of a billion- dollar deal for 18 Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets. These astronauts brought along cancer cells, bacteria and protein for studies in space. One of the two candidates, Sheikh Muszaphar succeeded in the training and was sent to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Angkasawan program for the Malaysian National Space Agency (MNSA) and the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). The mission was a success and Sheikh Muszaphar became the first Malaysian national to travel to space. In 2016, Malaysia acknowledged Russia's strength in the military and aerospace sector and sought their help in the expansion of those sectors in Malaysia. In 2018, Russia set a branch office of the Russian Centre of Science and Culture (RCSC) in Kota Kinabalu to expand the existing co-operation between Malaysia and Russia in the fields of economy, culture and science.

In 2009, a Russian- Singapore political dialogue was conducted which gained intensity. Among the attendees were Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Chairman of the Federation Council, Sergey Mironov, among other Russian delegates, and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, among other Singaporean delegates. The first state visit by a Russian head of state to Singapore was in 2009, where Russian president Dmitry Medvedev visited Singapore on 15‚Äì16 November. President Dmitry met with President S. R. Nathan, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his cabinet. The Russian-Singapore Joint Statement on the State Visit of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Singapore determines the further steps to be taken to further enhance bilateral ties. One of the major results of the state visit of the Russian leader to Singapore was the establishment of the High-Level Russia-Singapore Inter-governmental Commission. The first and second sessions of the commission took place in Singapore, September 2010, and in Moscow, September 2011, respectively. Presently, the commission is co-chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, Chief of Staff of the Government of the Russian Federation Vyacheslav Volodin and Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Finance and Minister for Manpower of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam. As Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev most recently met Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong again in November 2015 that noted increased trade between the two countries, and expanding economic activities by companies Interparliamentary and interregional relations have also progressed for the last years. The ASEAN-Russian summit is held annually where leaders of member states meet with the Russian President. Trade and economy is the locomotive of bilateral cooperation. Besides bilateral trade which has exceeded more than 17 billion US dollars, investment, scientific and technological cooperation has received an additional impulse. An agreement between the Government of Singapore and the Government of Russia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income is applied to income derived on or after 1 January 2010. The Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments was signed on 27 September 2010. The sixth annual Russia-Singapore Business Forum was held in Singapore in September 2011. The representatives of public and private sectors of Russia, Singapore, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Asia-Pacific Region participated in the forum. Russia and Singapore celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2018.http://www.scmp.com/week- asia/business/article/2139635/meet-russian-risk-takers-making-safe-singapore- their-homehttps://thepeakmagazine.com.sg/events/celebrating-50-years-of- diplomatic-relations-between-russia-and-singapore/ Russian President Putin met with his counterpart President Halimah and was hosted to a state dinner. He also attended the ASEAN-Russia summit and the unveiling of the foundation stone of the Russian Cultural Center and a Russian orthodox church. http://tass.com/world/1030583 Diplomatic representation In 1994, the Russian Federation appointed its first Ambassador to Singapore, M. M. Bely, who served from 1994 to 1999. In 1999, S. B. Kiselev became the second Ambassador to Singapore, followed by Andrey Rozhkov who served from 2005 to 2011. The current Russian Ambassador to Singapore is Andrey Alexeyevich Tatarinov. Singapore's first official representative to the Soviet Union was Chandra Das, who functioned in Moscow as Singapore's trade representative. The trade office was located in Hotel Ukraine in Moscow and on 4 May 1971, the embassy was open near the current Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Singapore's first Ambassador to the Soviet Union was P. S. Raman, who was appointed on 15 July 1971 and presented his credentials to the Soviet Government on 30 July 1971. The current ambassador is Simon Tensing de Cruz, who took up the position on 14 October 2008. =List of Russian ambassadors to Singapore= * M. M.

The debate is political in nature with the ultimate goal on the Chinese side of legitimizing Chinese control of the territory now known as the Tibet Autonomous Region or Xizang Autonomous Region. The pro-PRC argument is that Tibetan culture, government, and society were barbaric prior to the Chinese takeover of Tibet and that this only changed due to Chinese influence in the region. The pro-Tibetan independence movement argument is that this is a misrepresentation of history created as a political tool in order to justify the Sinicization of Tibet. This argued distortion of history is believed by those seeking Tibetan independence to prove that Chinese claims to the region are not legitimate.Powers 2004, pg. 7 Chinese claims commonly portray Tibet from 1912 to 1951 as a feudal society and both the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas as slave owners. These claims further highlight statements by the PRC that, prior to 1959, 95% of Tibetans allegedly lived in feudal serfdom, and cite cases of abuse and cruelty which are allegedly inherent to the traditional Tibetan system.Goldstein 1997, p.56 Pro-Tibetan independence forces and countries which are sympathetic to their cause, especially many Western countries, often scrutinize the Chinese claims since much of the evidence is supposedly limited or unreliable.  The idea of Tibet and the concept of serfdom  One of the central points of contention in the debate about labour and human rights in the historical region of Tibet before and after its incorporation into the modern state of the People's Republic of China is the very definition of Tibet and serfdom itself, with some scholars claiming that the debate is framed around Eurocentric, Sinocentric and anachronistic ideas about statehood and society which are projected onto the history of the area in a way that distorts understanding. Some western scholars reject claims of \\"serfdom in Tibet\\" outright based on the view that \\"Tibet\\" cannot be defined as one political entity or social system; its political and socioeconomic structures have varied greatly over time and between sub-districts. The various polities comprising Tibet have changed significantly over the past 2,000 years, and even during the modern period there have been dramatic changes in what Tibet is, as anthropologist Geoff Childs writes: > \\"[Tibet] has undergone numerous political transformations from a unified > empire (640‚Äì842) incorporating parts of what are now Nepal, India, Pakistan, > and several provinces of China (Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan), to a > collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities > associated with various monasteries (842‚Äì1248), to protectorate under the > power of an expanding Mongol empire (1248‚Äì1368), back to a collection of > independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with > various monasteries (1368‚Äì1642), to a centralized state under the clerical > administration of the Dalai Lamas (1642‚Äì1720), to a protectorate of the > Manchu Qing Dynasty (1720‚Äì1911), and finally to a nation having de facto > independence under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas > (1911‚Äì1951)\\" Although the central leadership in Lhasa had authority of these areas for various periods, some Western writers claim that this did not imply the kind of political control seen in modern Western states. According to Luciano Petech, \\"K'ams [the Kham region, largely synonymous with the province of XIkang which was abolished in 1950] was practically independent of Lhasa under its great lamas\\" in the 18th century CE.Petech 1973, pp. 51, 98 Furthermore, the areas of Qinghai with large Tibetan populations were not continuously ruled by Lhasa, including in the period leading up to the establishment of the PRC (in the late 1930s and 1940s) when the Kuomintang Muslim warlord Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai within the Republic of China (ROC). The definition of Tibet has been contested with a map of competing claims identifying six distinct types of Tibetan regions claimed by various entities. In the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and in the ROC (1912‚Äì1949), the part of Tibet governed by Lhasa was limited to the modern Tibet Autonomous Region, and did not include the Kham (Xikang) Province of China. Meanwhile, the western part of Xikang (i.e. Qamdo) and Qinghai was only occupied by Lhasa in the Tibet-Kham War which lasted from the 1910s to 1930s. Generally, the government of the PRC also limits Tibet to the area it has designated the Tibet Autonomous Region, consisting of the traditional areas of √ú, Tsang, Ngari, along with Qamdo (i.e. the western Kham/Xikang) which was legally incorporated into the TAR when Xikang Province was abolished by the NPC in 1955. The Tibetan government in exile claims that other ethnically Tibetan areas to the east and to the north also belong to Tibet, i.e. \\"Greater Tibet\\". These areas now respectively belong to Qinghai Province, Gansu Province, Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province of China.Powers 2004, pg. 163 Scholarship frequently represents a limited survey, restricted to the central region of Tibet, and may not accurately represent the whole of cultural Tibet or all Tibetan speaking peoples. Discussing the social structure of Tibet inevitably leads to difficulties with defining terms. Not only may serf and feudalism be Western terms inappropriate for Asian use but the geography and peoples of Tibet vary according to interpreter. The lack of agreement of the various sides as to terminology highlights that the \\"serfdom in Tibet\\" controversy is a politicised debate, with the term \\"feudal serfdom\\" largely being used by the People's Republic of China as a justification for their taking control of Tibet. According to the PRC: > ...there was a historically imperative need for the progress of Tibetan > society and the welfare of the Tibetan people to expel the imperialists and > shake off the yoke of feudal serfdom. The founding of the People's Republic > of China in 1949 brought hope for the deeply distressed Tibetan people. In > conforming to the law of historical development and the interests of the > Tibetan people, the Central People's Government worked actively to bring > about Tibet's peaceful liberation. After that, important policies and > measures were adopted for Tibet's Democratic Reform, regional autonomy, > large-scale modernization and reform and opening-up. However, the Tibetan government in exile responds: > ...the Chinese justifications make no sense. First of all, international law > does not accept justifications of this type. No country is allowed to > invade, occupy, annex and colonize another country just because its social > structure does not please it. Secondly, the PRC is responsible for bringing > more suffering in the name of liberation. Thirdly, necessary reforms were > initiated and Tibetans are quite capable of doing so. Competing versions of Tibetan history It is difficult to find academic consensus on the nature of society in Tibetan history. Sources on the history of Tibet are available from both pro-Chinese and pro-Tibetan writers. Pro- Chinese materials may be published by mainstream Western printers, or within the People's Republic of China. Tibetan materials, similarly, may be published by mainstream Western printers, or by the Tibetan Government in Exile. Both sides hope to persuade foreign readers to support their own point of view through these publications.Powers 2004, pp. 6‚Äì7 Many of the pro-Chinese works in English on the subject were translated from Chinese. Translators are not named, but censors are. Asian studies scholar John Powers concludes that ideology was the most powerful influence on the translations: \\"In contemporary China, the Communist Party strictly controls the presentation of history, and several formal resolutions have been issued by the Central Committee, which are intended to guide historians in the \\"correct\\" interpretation of historical events and actors.\\"Powers 2004, p. 12 The writings of contemporary Chinese historians conform to Marxist-Leninist doctrine, which asserts that societies progress from primitive communism, to slave societies, which are then overthrown and replaced by feudalism, which are in their turn overthrown and replaced by capitalism, which is followed ‚Äì via rebellion, again ‚Äì by socialism, which may progress peacefully toward communism. Several Chinese sources insert peasant rebellions into their accounts of Tibetan history, to achieve conformity with this structure required by political dogma. Historians in China are prevented from performing research that could challenge orthodoxy. Marx condemned religion as \\"the opiate of the masses\\", and this doctrine is also infused in Chinese writings on history.Powers 2004, pp. 12‚Äì14 In accordance with their political perspectives, Chinese sources claim that the common Tibetans suffered appallingly before the Chinese takeover.Powers 2004, pp. 19‚Äì20 Western authors' writings on Tibetan history are sometimes controversial. For example, whilst Hugh Richardson, who lived in Lhasa in the 1930s and 1940s, before the takeover by the PRC in 1951, writes in Tibet and Its History that Chinese versions of Tibetan history are contemptible and he considers the Chinese rule brutal and illegal,Powers 2004, pg. 16 Israel Epstein, a naturalized Chinese citizen born in Poland who similarly claims the authority of first-hand knowledge, although following the Chinese takeover, supports Chinese rule.Powers 2004, pp. 17‚Äì18 There are few academic assessments of the recent history of Tibet. Anthropologist and historian Melvyn Goldstein, who is fluent in Tibetan and has done considerable fieldwork with Tibetans in exile and in Tibet, consider pre-1950 Tibet to have been a feudal theocracy impaired by corrupt and incompetent leaders.Powers 2004, pg. 21 It was de facto independent of China from 1911 to 1949, but not recognized as de jure independent of China by any nation, including its protective power Great Britain.Goldstein 1989, ps. 815‚Äì824 The Chinese side seeks to persuade international perception as to the appropriate nature and justifiability of Chinese rule in Tibet. Their position is that Tibet truly and historically belongs to China, that affairs of Tibet are internal matters, and Tibetans seek to internationalize their cause, in part by convincing readers that Tibet was independent.Powers 2004, pg. 8 Concentrating as it does on questions of national sovereignty, the official position of the Tibetan Government in Exile is more moderate in tone than that of some of its more extreme supporters who conflate the rule of the lamas with Tibetan Buddhist ideals, seeking to promote a Buddhist dogma that competes with the Marxist dogma of \\"feudal serfdom\\" by portraying Tibet under the lamas as, in Robert Thurman's words: \\"a mandala of the peaceful, perfected universe\\".Inner Revolution: Robert Thurman Tibetologist Robert Barnett writes: :\\"Chinese references to preliberation conditions in Tibet thus appear to be aimed at creating popular support for Beijing's project in Tibet. These claims have particular resonance among people who share the assumption‚Äîbased on nineteenth-century Western theories of \\"social evolution\\" that are still widely accepted in China‚Äîthat certain forms of society are \\"backward\\" and should be helped to evolve by more \\"advanced\\" societies. This form of prejudice converges with some earlier Chinese views and with vulgar Marxist theories that imagine a vanguard movement liberating the oppressed classes or nationalities in a society, whether or not those classes agree that they are oppressed. Moreover, the Chinese have to present that oppression as very extensive, and that society as very primitive, in order to explain why there were no calls by the Tibetan peasantry for Chinese intervention on their behalf. :The question of Tibet's social history is therefore highly politicized, and Chinese claims in this respect are intrinsic to the functioning of the PRC, and not some free act of intellectual exploration. They have accordingly to be treated with caution. From a human rights point of view, the question of whether Tibet was feudal in the past is irrelevant. A more immediate question is why the PRC does not allow open discussion of whether Tibet was feudal or oppressive. Writers and researchers in Tibet face serious repercussions if they do not concur with official positions on issues such as social conditions in Tibet prior to its \\"liberation,\\" and in such a restrictive climate, the regime's claims on this issue have little credibility.\\"Barnett 2008, p. 84 =The political debate= Chinese sources portray Tibet before 1950 as feudal serfdom in which serfs suffered terribly under the despotic rule of lamas and aristocrats. Some Tibetan sources describe the people as happy, content, and devoted to Buddhism.,Powers 2004, pp. 18‚Äì19 On the other hand, the Tibetan Phuntsok Wangyal, who founded the Tibetan Communist Party in the 1940s, describes the old system as unequal and exploitative.Goldstein, Sherap, and Siebenschuh 2004, pp. 68‚Äì69 One of the earliest publications in English to apply the term \\"serf\\" to Tibet was Marxist sympathiser Anna Louise Strong's work from 1960, When Serfs Stood up in Tibet, published by the Chinese government.Powers 2004, pg. 167 Another seminal promoter of the term is historian A. Tom Grunfeld, who based his writings on the work of British explorers of the region, in particular Sir Charles Bell. It has been argued that his book is not supported by traditional Tibetan, Chinese, or Indian histories, that it contains inaccuracies and distortions,Powers 2004, pg. 21Powers 2004, pg. 167 and that Grunfeld's extracts from Bell were taken out of context to mislead readers. Grunfeld is a polarizing figure for the Chinese, who praise his work, his scholarship, and his integrity; and the Tibetans, who match this praise with condemnation,Powers 2004, pg. 165 calling him a \\"sinologist\\" who lacks authority on Tibetan history due to his inability to read Tibetan and his not having been to Tibet before writing his book. Political scientist Michael Parenti's 2003 (revised in 2007) essay Friendly Feudalism:The Tibet Myth was largely based on the preceding work of Stuart and Roma Gelder (Timely Rain: Travels in New Tibet 1964), Strong and Grunfeld,. Melvyn Goldstein has produced many works on Tibetan society since the 1960s and used \\"serf\\" to translate the Tibetan term mi ser (literally \\"yellow person\\";Powers 2004, pg. 168 also translated as peasant\\") and to describe both the landless peasant classes and the wealthier land holding and taxpaying class of families. He has written, \\"with the exception of about 300 noble families, all laymen and laywomen in Tibet were serfs (Mi ser) bound via ascription by parallel descent to a particular lord (dPon-po) though an estate, in other words sons were ascribed to their father's lord but daughters to their mother's lord.\\"Goldstein, Central Asiatic Journal, pg. 15 In his 1989 book A History of Modern Tibet Goldstein argued that although serfdom was prevalent in Tibet, this did not mean that it was an entirely static society. There were several types of serf sub-status, of which one of the most important was the \\"human lease\\", which enabled a serf to acquire a degree of personal freedom. This was an alternative which, despite retaining the concept of lordship, partially freed the mi ser from obligations to a landed estate, usually for an annual fee.Goldstein, Journal of Asian Studies, May 1971, pp. 521‚Äì34 In 1997 Goldstein used the term \\"serf\\" in the following, more cautious, way \\"...monastic and aristocratic elites ... held most of the land in Tibet in the form of feudal estates with hereditarily bound serflike peasants.\\"Goldstein 1997, p.35 Powers has characterized Goldstein as \\"generally pro-China\\"Powers 2004, pg. 24 but also called his History of Modern Tibet \\"the most balanced treatment\\".Powers 2004, pg. 17 Goldstein describes himself as having conservative political views.Letter to WTN by Goldstein July 2008, quoted on http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=22134&article;=Goldstein's+Response+to+Jamyang+Norbu. According to William Monroe Coleman, China misrepresents Goldstein's usage as support for their version of Tibetan history. Goldstein distinguished serfdom from feudalism, and applied the term \\"serfdom\\" but not \\"feudalism\\" to old Tibet. Furthermore, he made some effort to avoid appearing to support China's invasion of Tibet, writing that the PRC left the traditional system in place, not only after the invasion of 1950, but even after the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959. He pointed out that in 1950, Chinese rhetoric claimed that China was freeing Tibet, not from serfdom, but from imperialist influence.Goldstein, \\"Reexamining Choice\\" (1986), pg. 109 Nevertheless, his usage has been misinterpreted as support for the Chinese Marxist viewpoint, in which feudalism and serfdom are inseparable, and old Tibet is consistently described as \\"feudal serfdom\\". Not all writers who use the term \\"serfdom\\" to describe the pre-Communist society in Tibet do so pejoratively. Pico Iyer, a journalist whose father is a friend of the Dalai Lama and who has himself been in private conversation with him for over thirty years writes: \\"Almost as soon as he came into exile, in 1959, the Dalai Lama seized the chance to get rid of much of the red tape and serfdom that had beset Tibet in the past\\".Iyer 2008, p.176 The Dalai Lama himself used the term \\"serf\\" in 1991, saying: \\"The relationship between landlord and serf was much milder in Tibet than in China and conditions for the poor were much less harsh.\\"Freedom in Exile, HHDL 1991. p. 101 Several Tibetan sources portray Tibetan peasants and workers to support their own view of a Tibetan people who were not only independent of China, but found the Chinese alien and incomprehensible, and who suffered genocide under Chinese rule.Powers 2004, pp. 9‚Äì12 Richardson, the British Trade Envoy to Tibet in the 1940s, agrees with Tibetan authors, stating there was little difference between the rich and the poor.Powers 2004, pg. 22 Journalist Thomas Laird notes that scholars debate the applicability of these terms to Tibet, and struggle with a lack of sufficient data.Laird 2006, pp.317‚Äì9 Journalist Barbara Crossette asserted in 1998 that \\"scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic serfdom in Tibet in centuries.\\"Crossette 1998 The Tibetan Government-in-Exile says about conditions in Tibet pre-Communism: > Traditional Tibetan society was, by no means, perfect and was in need of > changes. The Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders have admitted as much. > That is the reason why the Dalai Lama initiated far-reaching reforms in > Tibet as soon as he assumed temporal authority. The traditional Tibetan > society, however, was not nearly as bad as China would have us believe. =The academic debate= The academic debate as to whether \\"serf\\" is an applicable term for a society such as pre-Communist Tibet continues to this day. Goldstein and Miller's exchanges in an academic journal between 1986 and 1989 were a notable part of this debate. The applicability of the concept of serfdom to Tibet was debated between Melvyn Goldstein and anthropologist Beatrice D. Miller of Wisconsin University over a series of five articles in the Tibet Journal. The debate was initiated by Goldstein in the XI edition of the Tibet Journal, in which he defended his description of the features of Tibetan society as being very comparable to European serfdom.Goldstein (1986) pp.80‚Äì86 He based the comparison on the features of serfdom described by French historian Marc Bloch including:Goldstein (1986) p.81 * The status was hereditary. * A serf, unlike a slave, had rights and possessed but did not own productive resources (land). * The lord had the legal right to command his serfs, including judicial authority over him or her. Goldstein argued that Tibetan society fulfilled all these requirements, and argued in detail against the specific diverging opinions of fellow scholars Miller, Micheal, Dargyay and Aziz. He underpinned his assertions by research, first hand accounts and case studies, and responded to criticisms which had been voiced by these researchers in the preceding years. Only Miller responded in the next The Tibet Journal, in a short letter, in 1987. She acknowledged Goldstein's scholarship, stating \\"Goldstein's article ... cannot be faulted. It is an outstanding example of his exemplary collection of fine data.\\"Miller (1987) p.65 She disagreed however with his interpretation, specifically the use of the word \\"serf\\" and challenged him by asserting the following: * That a lord also had obligations to the central government, so the specific obligations of a peasant (Tibetan: \\"mi ser\\") to a lord were only examples of societal obligations which everyone had. * That the obligations owed to a lord were by the family collective, and not \\"personal\\" or individual.Miller (1987) p.66 * That the obligations of a peasant were not so onerous as it was easy to run away.Miller (1987) pp.66‚Äì67 In the following issue Goldstein replied in brief arguing: * The nature of the lord's relation with the central government was radically different from the peasant/lord relation and not relevant to the peasant/lord relation he was discussing. * While corvee obligations fell primarily on households, a peasant's legal status very much related to his person was hereditary and not rescindable.Goldstein (1988) p.62 * He pointed out that running away was illegal, punishable, and that European serfs also ran away.Goldstein (1988) p.64 * He strongly disagreed with Miller's assertion that the peasant/lord relation was fundamentally contractual.Goldstein (1988) p.65 In a later publication and response Goldstein agreed to differ on the use of the word \\"serf\\" to prevent a terminological discussion distracting from the examination of societal conditions. He argued that running away was an act of desperation severing familial, social and economic ties.Goldstein (1989) p.56 He discussed the form of partial manumission known as \\"human lease\\" and argued that: it only temporarily freed from daily service but not occasional service at the lord's discretion; the payment of an annual fee decided by the lord was required; it was revocable at will by the lord. Thus he felt it was a very weak form of manumission.Goldstein (1989) pp.56‚Äì59 Coleman, integrating Goldstein's research with subsequent work done by other scholars including Rebecca French, Graham Clarke, and Franz Michael, argues that Goldstein overemphasized the de jure status of the mi ser at the expense of de facto characteristics ‚Äì a high degree of social and economic mobility, and hence autonomy; frequently successful negotiations with lords to improve their status; and flight from untenable situations such as unpayable debts and exorbitant labor requirements. He concludes that \\"serf\\" is a misleading term for the Tibetan mi ser. Human rights in Tibet In the political debate regarding the nature of pre-Communist Tibet, Chinese sources assert human rights abuses as a justification for the Communist invasion. Both before and after the Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. The political debate associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties. Sympathisers of the Chinese government's position view the pre-1950s abuses as justifying the Communist regime in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile argue that the 13th Dalai Lama had already effected reforms which were ahead of the world at the time, and that further reforms were underway, and no outside intervention was justified. =Prior to 1950= Judicial mutilation ‚Äì principally the gouging out of eyes, and the cutting off of hands or feet ‚Äì was formalized under the Sakya school as part of the 13th century Tibetan legal code, and was used as a legal punishment until being declared illegal in 1913 by a proclamation of the 13th Dalai Lama.Barnett 2008, pp. 81‚Äì83 In this same reform, the Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so (preceding, for instance, Switzerland, Britain, and France). The 14th Dalai Lama's brother Jigme Norbu reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained.\\"Norbu 1968, pg. 317.Laird 2006, p. 244 Incidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.Goldstein, Sherap, Siebenschuh 2004 p. 90. Robert W. Ford, one of the few Westerners to have been appointed by the Government of Tibet at the time of de facto independent Tibet, spent five years in Tibet, from 1945 to 1950, before his arrest by the invading Chinese army. In his book Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet, he writes Heinrich Harrer who lived in Tibet at the same time (1944 to 1951) wrote in his book \\"Return to Tibet\\" that these treatments had already ceased at that time: Because Tibetan Buddhism prohibits killing, mutilation and other extremely cruel punishments were widely used instead in old Tibet. The mutilation of top level Tibetan official Lungshar in 1934 gave an example. Tsepon Lungshar, an official educated in England, introduced reform in the 1920s; after losing a political struggle the reformist was sentenced to be blinded by having his eyeballs pulled out. \\"The method involved the placement of a smooth, round yak's knucklebone on each of the temples of the prisoner. These were then tied by leather thongs around the head and tightened by turning the thongs with a stick on top of the head until the eyeballs popped out. The mutilation was terribly bungled. Only one eyeball popped out, and eventually the ragyaba had to cut out the other eyeball with a knife. Boiling oil was then poured into the sockets to cauterize the wound.\\"Demystifying Tibet: unlocking the secrets of the Land of the Snows pp. 127A History of Modern Tibet, 1913‚Äì1951, Melvyn C. Goldstein pp. 208‚Äì209 This was sufficiently unusual that the untouchables (ragyaba) carrying it out had no previous experience of the correct technique and had to rely on instructions heard from their parents. An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well. As late as 1949 the Tibetan government still sentenced people to mutilation. When a CIA officer Douglas Mackiernan was killed against official entry permit, six Tibetan border guards were tried and sentenced in Lhasa. \\"The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each.\\" The sentence was reduced to 200, 50 and 25 lashes, respectively, after another CIA agent Frank Bessac requested leniency. Whipping was legal and common as punishmentFrench (1995) pp. 276, 316, 321‚Äì322 in Tibet including in the 20th century, also for minor infractions and outside judicial process. Whipping could also have fatal consequences, as in the case of the trader Gyebo Sherpa subjected to the severe corca whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison.Goldstein, 1989 p163 The Tibetan tibetologist Tashi Tsering records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.Goldstein, Tsering, and Siebenschuh, 1997 pp. 3‚Äì5 In its 100 Questions and Answers About Tibet the People's Republic of China states that human rights were 'severely infringed upon' by the Dalai Lama's administration. The evidence for these accusations is disputed.Barnett, Robert, in: Blondeau, Anne-Marie and Buffetrille, Katia (eds). Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions (2008) University of California Press. (cloth); (paper) According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed criminal offenses as uncommon, but there are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes.French (1995) p.315-316 Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials were also more likely to find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution. Political power could play a role in a judicial process in Tibet. In the eye gouging case above the alleged criminal was a deposed member of the Kashag called Lungshar who had proposed democratic reform. The charge was planning a coup and the attempted murder of another Kashag member who opposed reform. It was strenuously denied by the accused. Conviction was based on the evidence of one informer who claimed to have seen a document which was never produced. He was richly rewarded, and the trial seems to have been a show trial by traditionalists seeking to prevent reform. From arrest to execution of the sentence was only ten days, limiting the possibilities of appeal.Goldstein, pp. 200‚Äì210 One evidence of Chinese brutality in Eastern Tibet was reported by an American missionary in the following terms: > There is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these > Tibetans, slicing, boiling, tearing asunder and all ‚Ä¶To sum up what China is > doing here in eastern Tibet, the main things are collecting taxes, robbing, > oppressing, confiscating, and allowing her representatives to burn and loot > and steal. Believing that the American missionary's account might be a mistake, Sir Eric Teichman, a British diplomat, noted that whatever brutality existed, it was \\"in no way due to any action of the Chinese government in Peking or the provincial authorities in Szechuana.\\" =Slavery= Israel Epstein wrote that prior to the Communist takeover, poverty in Tibet was so severe that in some of the worst cases peasants had to hand over children to the manor as household slaves or nangzan, because they were too poor to raise them.Epstein 1983, pg. 46 On the other hand, Laird asserted that in the 1940s Tibetan peasants were well off and immune to famine, whereas starvation was common in China.Laird 2006, pp. 318‚Äì9 According to other sources, the so-called \\"slaves\\" were domestic servants (nangtsen) and managers of estates in reality.Kuzmin, S.L. Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011, p. 135 In 1904 a British expeditionary force occupied the Chumbi Valley for four years, in the border region adjacent to Bhutan and India. Sir Charles Bell was put in charge of the district from September 1904 to November 1905Bell 1992, pg. xviii and wrote that slavery was still practiced in Chumbi but had declined greatly over the previous thirty years. He noted that only a dozen or two dozen slaves remained, unlike nearby Bhutan where slavery was more widespread. Bell further remarked, \\"The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was easy for him to escape into Sikkim and British India.\\"Bell 1992, pp. 78‚Äì79. =Tibetan welfare after the Chinese takeover= Just as the Chinese and the Tibetan exile community argue over whether common Tibetans suffered or flourished before the Chinese takeover, they take diametrically opposing views on the fate of ordinary Tibetans since 1950. This is understood to be highly important in persuading readers of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Chinese rule. Chinese sources in English claim rapid progress for prosperous, free, and happy Tibetans participating in democratic reforms. Tibetans, on the other hand, write of Chinese genocide in Tibet, comparing the Chinese to the Nazis.Powers 2004, pp. 11‚Äì12 After the Cultural Revolution, according to Powers, scholar Warren Smith, whose work became focused on Tibetan history and politics after spending five months in Tibet in 1982, portrays the Chinese as chauvinists who believe they are superior to the Tibetans, and claims that the Chinese use torture, coercion and starvation to control the Tibetans.Powers 2004, pp. 23‚Äì24 The Tibet Autonomous Region is much poorer than other provinces of China. In 1980, in order to help Tibet out of poverty, the 1st Tibet Work Forum (moderated by Hu Yaobang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China), decided to give the Tibet Autonomous Region financial support, in order to build a \\"united, prosperous, civilized new Tibet\\". After this Forum, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, all taxes on agriculture and animal husbandry were waived, while other provinces had to wait until 2006 for the same. The old ‚Äúpeople's commune‚Äù economic system was dismantled (while in other provinces it was ended in 1985), so farmland started to be used by the household, and livestock started to be owned and used by the household. In the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region is the only provincial level administrative region that enjoys some tax incentives, and after 1988 is the only provincial level administrative region that receives growing substantial quota subsidies from the central government. Under the \\"partner assistance\\" policy, all the rich provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, most of the Central Government organs, and some central enterprises respectively assist the prefectures and cities of the Tibet Autonomous Region. With this assistance, in 1988, the Tibet Autonomous Region eliminated its fiscal deficit for the first time in history. As the only provincial level \\"poverty-stricken areas which lie in vast, contiguous stretches\\" in the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region developed a lot of anti-poverty programs, and the impoverished population has been shrinking substantially. However, there are still many difficulties in poverty reduction., 2002. Until the end of 2012, the social security system in the Tibet Autonomous Region has been completely established. This system not only includes ordinary people, but also all the 29,000 monks and nuns of Tibetan Buddhism in the Tibet Autonomous Region. There is also evidence of human rights infringements, including the 2006 Nangpa La shootings. See human rights in the People's Republic of China and Human rights in Tibet (include all the Tibetan areas) for an overview. The Human Rights Watch World Report 2008: Events in China 2007 states: > Widespread and numerous instances of repression target ordinary citizens, > monks, nuns, and even children in an effort to quash alleged \\"separatism.\\" > Seven Tibetan boys in Gansu province were detained for over a month in early > September after they allegedly wrote slogans on the walls of a village > police station and elsewhere calling for the return of the Dalai Lama and a > free Tibet.

It is notable in this report that most of the examples are not in the Tibet Autonomous Region, but in other provinces of China, such as Gansu Province and Sichuan Province (Tibetan areas in Sichuan are the eastern part of Kham). These areas (i.e. the Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province, Gansu Province, Yunnan Province and Qinghai Province) were not included in political Tibet, so they were not involved in the Serfs' Emancipation, which was in the Tibet Autonomous Region. During the \\"reform and opening up\\" after 1978, when the central government of the PRC gave numerous support policies and substantial financial support to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan areas in the four provinces did not get the same. Although some of them (such as the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan) are rich enough, others of them are not rich, and some of them in Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai are poor enough. The Tibetan areas in the four provinces ask the central government to benefit them as the Tibet Autonomous Region. And the poverty in these areas makes some of their Tibetan residents support the idea of \\"Greater Tibet\\" which is claimed by Tibetan exile groups.Â∞§Âäõ, Êù®ÊòéÊ¥™, Êñ∞ÂΩ¢Âäø‰∏ãË•øËóè‰∏éÂõõÁúÅËóèÂå∫ÂçèË∞ÉÂèëÂ±ïÂü∫ÁÇπÁ†îÁ©∂, Ë•øÂçóÊ∞ëÊóèÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â≠¶Êä•(‰∫∫ÊñáÁ§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶Áâà) 2014Âπ¥09ÊúüÂªñÊ°ÇËìâ, ÂõõÂ∑ùËóèÂå∫Ë¥´Âõ∞Áä∂ÂÜµÂèäËÑ±Ë¥´ÈöúÁ¢çÂàÜÊûê, ÂÜúÊùëÁªèÊµé2014Âπ¥Á¨¨1Êúü In 2010, on the 5th Tibet Work Forum, the central government declared its intention to make the Tibetan areas in the four provinces steadily progress as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region. The goal is to bring the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan areas in the four provinces in line together with the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way in 2020. Comparison to other regions Debate continues as to whether pre-Communist Tibetan society was especially oppressive or was comparable to, or better than, similar social structures in nearby regions. According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile: \\"In terms of social mobility and wealth distribution, independent Tibet compared favourably with most Asian countries\\" the fact that most Dalai Lamas, including Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama and Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, came from peasant families being cited as an example of this. Travelers who witnessed conditions in both China and Tibet in the 1940s found the Tibetan peasants to be far better off than their Chinese counterparts.Laird 2006, pp. 318‚Äì9 Academics debate whether tribal cultures, such as the Mongolian nomadic steppe culture, are feudal in nature.Di Cosmo, Nicola, State Formation and Periodization in Inner Asian History Journal of World History ‚Äì Volume 10, Number 1, Spring 1999, pp. 1‚Äì40 Much of Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese political history is inter-related but the extent of their shared social culture is uncertain. According to the 'United Nations Research Institute for Social Development', bonded labor and other forms of economic exploitation currently exist in nearby regions including India, Nepal, and several Chinese provinces.United Nations Research Institute for Social Development. Layers of Silence:Links between women's vulnerability, trafficking and HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh, India and Nepal Draft paper, 2002. Source (accessed: 17 June 2008), Kamaiya, the bonded labour system in neighbouring Nepal, was formally abolished in the year 2000. In 2007 Shanxi, China was the scene of its own slave scandal that turned out to involve human trafficking and slave labor in Hebei, Guangdong and Xinjiang provinces as well. According to the U.S. Dept of State \\"Trafficking in Persons Report 2008\\" Bangladesh, Nepal, Mongolia and Pakistan are all Tier 2 countries, with China and India both on the Tier 2 watchlist. However no local regions are in Tier 3.

The two countries are referred to as the two petroleum superpowers and account for about a quarter of the world's crude oil production between them. Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union Moscow, 1932: Soviet diplomat Karim Hakimov accompanies the future King of Saudi Arabia, Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The first country to establish full diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd (the name of the Saudi state until 1932) was the Soviet Union.Ismael, Tareq Y., The Communist Movement in the Arab World. New York City: RoutledgeCurzon, 2005. p. 9. The relations began in 1926 as a means for Moscow to stand up to the UK. The first Consul General was Karim Khakimov, a Soviet Muslim of Tatar descent sometimes called the Soviet Lawrence of Arabia, who in February 1926 drove through gunfire from Jeddah to Ibn Saud's residence in the desert to hand over a formal note recognising his status as king. Relations improved further when in June 1926 the Pan-Islamic Congress of Mecca was called to resolve the dispute over control of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. The Soviet Union, with its 30 million Soviet Muslims, supported Ibn Saud by sending six Soviet Islamic scholars to take part in the congress, contrary to its atheistic ideology. Using the Soviet influence to spread Communist propaganda among Hajj pilgrims was unsuccessful so the diplomatic focus turned to the creation of trade links between Soviet Black Sea ports and Hejaz. Ibn Saud's son Prince Faisal (who became king in 1964) visited the Soviet Union in 1932 during his extensive European trip. King Abdulaziz used Moscow's offer of one million British pounds in financial aid as leverage with London and never accepted the USSR's offer. However, relations cooled later on; in 1932, the Soviet Muslims were unofficially banned from performing Hajj. Khakimov returned to Jeddah as the Head of Mission in 1935, and tried to renew the relationship, but Moscow was no longer interested in new trade contracts. Stalin, who was never convinced of the value of the USSR's presence in the Gulf, saw the partnership with King Abdulaziz and political ambitions for the Gulf as disposable political gambits that Moscow thought would enhance relations with England, whose support the Soviet Union sought against Hitler. Khakimov was recalled to Moscow for a routine visit in 1937 and arrested on suspicion of being a spy; he and his colleague Turyakulov fell victim to Stalin's political terror. Turyakulov was executed in October 1937 and Khakimov the following January. King Abdulaziz was outraged at the killing of these two Soviet diplomats whom he considered his friends. Two months after Khakimov's execution American geologists discovered the world's largest deposits of crude oil in Dhahran prompting the Soviet Union to appoint a new head of mission in Jeddah in 1938. King Abdulaziz refused to accept anyone other than Khakimov or Turyakulov and months later broke diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, accusing Moscow of inciting a revolution in the Muslim world. With the USSR out of the way, Britain and latterly the US took over the development and exploitation of Saudi oil. Relations were especially strained from 1979, during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, with Saudi Arabia supporting the Afghan Mujahideen in close cooperation with the United States. Diplomatic relations were only reestablished in 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Russian Federation. Despite a lack of relations, about 20 Soviet Muslims were allowed to annually make the Hajj from 1946 until 1990 when liberalization allowed thousands of Soviet Muslims to attend. In the 25 years since, Russian-Saudi relations have never developed beyond symbolic visits though in 2017 Saudi King Salman visited Moscow with a 1,500-strong delegation; however, the Moscow-Riyadh agreement paled in comparison to Saudi arms contracts with the US.

On 5 March 2020, OPEC cut its total production of oil, and called upon OPEC+ participants, including Russia, to do the same. Russia rejected the demand to cut oil production the following day, marking the end of the unofficial partnership with OPEC. Russia was also described as having been disappointed in the lack of Saudi investment in Russia during the past few years. Saudi Arabia consequently boosted production to increase its market share, leading to an oil price war between the countries. On March 20th, 2020, the Kremlin stated that in terms of oil, Saudi Arabia and Russia enjoy good relations, and that the Russian government does not want any other party to intervene in this relation. =Other events= During 2017, Saudi Arabia encouraged the United States to remove sanctions on Russia pertaining to its activity in Ukraine in exchange for Russian assistance in ending the Iranian military presence in Syria. Russia has remained neutral between Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the 2017‚Äì18 Qatar diplomatic crisis, offering to mediate in July 2017. In December 2017, Russia withdrew diplomatic representation from the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sana'a, in opposition to the killing of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh by the Houthis. The killing took place as a consequence of his defection from the Houthi-dominated Supreme Political Council to the Saudi coalition in the Yemeni Civil War. From December 2017 onward, Saudi Arabia abandoned its past support for UN resolutions condemning the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, instead choosing to abstain. In August 2018, Russia backed Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Canada, with Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stating that \\"the politicization of human rights matters is unacceptable\\". In the aftermath of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, Putin stated that Russia \\"cannot start deteriorating relations\\" with Saudi Arabia as \\"it did not know what really happened.\\" His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later added that there was \\"no reason basically not to believe\\" the official statements issued by Saudi Arabia on the matter. In December 2018, Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov warned the United States against interference in the line of succession to the Saudi throne by pushing for the ouster of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, following reports that U.S. officials would support replacing him with Ahmed bin Abdulaziz.

Geography Bodie is located at (48.832667, -118.896704), approximately by stagecoach heading north of Wauconda along Toroda Creek (County Road 9495) off Washington State Route 20. Bodie lies 2592 feet (790 m) above sea level. History of the region In 1886, prospectors Tommy RyanNot the well known fighter [Tommy Ryan] and Phil Creasor discovered a continuous mineralized ledge in the North of Okanogan County, and claimed the area as Eureka Gulch, which soon after became known as Republic. Republic, Washington's rapid heyday boasted seven hotels, twenty saloons, nine general stores, and an undisclosed number of brothels. The quality of ore discovered spurred the existence of many nearby mines and townships, including the near neighbors of Wauconda, Washington, and Bodie. Bodie, Washington Occupied in early 1888, two years after Ryan and Creasor discovered the lucrative area which became Republic's Knob Hill Mine, high quality ore was extracted, milled and processed right in Bodie until the falling gold prices closed the township's mine and emptied its buildings in 1934, at which time the town had functionally relocated to the Bodie Mining Camp. An estimated US$ 1.2 million in gold was recovered, and it's said that Bodie Creek still runs color. This scenic area, and its related ghost towns, regularly attract historians, mining buffs, and photographers to the slanting buildings, rusty equipment and mysterious log cabins. There is only one intact structure remaining of the original \\"Old Bodie\\", a small two story house converted to a storage building with the help of local resident Doug Prichard. The largest, most visible structure still vertical in what is now Bodie, is often cited as a schoolhouse which doubled as a saloon, but local legend disputes the matter. Old Bodie has also been confused with an assembly of cabins North of the Bodie Mining Camp, at the junction of Toroda Creek and the road to Curlew, which functioned as a saw mill. The Bodie Mine 48.830569 (Latitude) -118.89055 (Longitude)taken from: INACTIVE AND ABANDONED MINE LANDS‚ÄîBodie Mine, Wauconda Mining District, Okanogan County, Washington, circular 106, p.8 \\"Location and Map Information\\" Bodie mine North of Bodie Washington on Toroda Road, is the 1897, five-patent Bodie Mining Company claim,Okanogan SW¬º sec. 34, T39N R31E; extending into NE¬ºNW¬º sec. 3, T38N R31E later owned by the Northern Gold Company and Toroda Mines Inc. Torado Road bisects the appealing remnants of this mining camp, whose apparent ghost town is often confused with the original \\"old\\" Bodie Washington. The mine consists of an array of hard rock stopes and tunnels, penetrating a mineralized vein running the length of a ridge rising from Toroda Creek. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources did an in- depth reportDepartment of Natural Resources, Geology Division, Inactive Mines Circular 106 on this mine, and other properties in the region. Mining operations ceased during World War II, as extraction of essential wartime metals took priority by Government Order L-208 of the War Production Board. A stock certificate signed by president L.S. Kurtz indicates the mine's net worth to be US$1,500,000 in 1903.Geomineral Corp. Website The Bodie Mine is currently held in quiescence by the Geomineral Corporation. The property has been continuously occupied since its discovery. Bodie, California The Mine and the related city of Bodie, California, was named after its original claim holder, William S. Bodey,Robert Silverberg, Ghost Towns of The American West, 1968 p.50 whose eponym was changed as his tent city was underway, as an anonymous sign painter assumed the spelling of Bodie would wear better with time. More information \\"On the Republic-Chesaw wagon road, twenty-four miles northwest of Republic, is Bodie camp, in Okanogan county, the principal property being the BODIE mine. Shipments made to the Granby smelter, Grand Forks, B. C., showed values of $500 per ton. The GOLDEN REWARD group of claims was operated by a company of Spokane men, the mine being under the management of R. E. WILLOUGHBY.

Magda - (Series 1) A permanently miserable, silent personal assistant to the spoilt socialite Whizz Pinkham who humiliates her every lesson. Miss Openshaw - (Series 1) A supply teacher with excessive fake-tan and make-up.

He was known for his often unusual and inventive methods for helping runaway slaves escape to free states. He has also been referred to by the name James Fairfield. Biography Fairfield was born to a slave-holding family in Virginia. However, he disagreed with his family's livelihood as he became a young man. When he was twenty, he helped a childhood friend escape from his uncle's farm, taking him to Canada. Upon his return to Virginia, he learned that his uncle was planning to have him arrested, so he took several more slaves belonging to his uncle and led them through the mountains of northern Virginia and on to Canada. He soon became involved with the abolitionist movement and, during the 1850s, quickly establishing himself with a reputation as one of the most cunning conductors on the Underground Railroad. Primarily using routes directly to the Northeastern United States through Appalachia, he specialized in reuniting broken families. In one incident, he had been asked by a group of freed slaves to rescue relatives still enslaved in Charleston, West Virginia (then still part of Virginia) where they worked at the saltworks along the Kanawha River. Fairfield, with the assistance of two freedmen, traveled to Charleston posing as a businessman from Louisville, Kentucky. Ingratiating himself with the local slaveholders, he persuaded them to invest in a plan to build boats to haul salt extracted from the Kanawha salt brines and haul his cargo down river to be sold at a substantial profit. While he oversaw the construction of two boats, his \\"slaves\\" would scout the area in order to locate their relatives. During the next two nights, the boats were loaded with runaway slaves and quietly sent down river. Fairfield would raise the alarm hours later, furious over the \\"loss\\" of his slaves and property, and took it upon himself to organize a search party to overtake the fugitive slaves. Suggesting they split up to search the surrounding area, he arranged to rendezvous with the group but instead rode off in the opposite direction to catch up with the escaped slaves which he eventually led to Canada. Some argue that Fairfield often went to sometimes excessive lengths, often living in a community for months at a time in order to gain the confidence of local residents. He often posed as a slave trader, slaveholder or a peddler, although his disguises were varied and, on one occasion, impersonated an undertaker managing to help twenty-eight slaves escape in a staged funeral procession. Another time, he used wigs and makeup to disguise his charges. Purchasing train tickets for them, they traveled from Harper's Ferry eventually arriving in Pittsburgh.Switala, William J. Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books, 2001. (pg. 59) During a twelve-year period, he would make numerous trips to almost every slave state freeing several thousand slaves and forwarding them to Canada via agents of the Underground Railroad. He disappeared shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War. An unidentified man fitting Fairfield's description reportedly died during a slave insurrection in Cumberland County, Tennessee in 1860 or 1861. The man, who had recently arrived in the area, had been killed in a failed attempt to organize a mass escape of slaves. Although many conductors often disagreed with his methods including arming his passengers and resorting to violence when necessary, he was greatly admired in the Underground Railroad. Levi Coffin, a Quaker and fellow abolitionist, said of Fairfield, In Ain't No Harm to Kill the Devil: The Life and Legend of John Fairfield, Abolitionist for Hire, Jeffrey S. Copeland offers an alternative theory as to what happened to John Fairfield. Copeland argues that Fairfield would not have undertaken such a risky endeavor as the Cumberland Iron Works escape plan. Fairfield's escapes tended to avoid confrontation. Copeland suggests Fairfield could have instead used the incident to fake his own death and start a new life in Kansas Territory. Copeland has found an 1860 census record for a John Fairfield in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory.Copeland, Jeffrey S. Ain't No Harm to Kill the Devil: The Life and Legend of John Fairfield, Abolitionist for Hire. St. Paul, Minnesota: Paragon House, 2014. 318. .

Instead, the Blessed Sacrament that was consecrated at an earlier Mass and reserved is distributed. The liturgy had developed by the time of the Quinisext Council (Second Trullan Synod, 692). In the Roman and Anglican Rites it is used only on Good Friday, while in some Old Catholic Rites it is used on both Good Friday and Holy Saturday. In both the Ordinary and the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite, the term \\"Mass of the Presanctified\\" is not used in the Missal and other liturgical books, the ceremony having been retitled Solemn Afternoon Liturgy of the Passion and Death of the Lord (Solemnis actio liturgica postmeridiana in Passione et Morte Domini) in the 1955 revisions of Pope Pius XII. It is also called the Solemn Commemoration of the Lord's Passion. The Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite only on the weekdays (Monday through Friday) of Great Lent, and on Monday through Wednesday of Holy Week.

Statement  Eberlein‚Äì≈†mulian theorem: If X is a Banach space and A is a subset of X, then the following statements are equivalent: # each sequence of elements of A has a subsequence that is weakly convergent # each sequence of elements of A has a weak cluster point # the weak closure of A is weakly compact A set A can be weakly compact in three different ways: * Compactness (or Heine-Borel compactness): Every open cover of A admits a finite subcover. * Sequential compactness: Every sequence from A has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in A. * Limit point compactness: Every infinite subset of A has a limit point in A. The Eberlein‚Äì≈†mulian theorem states that the three are equivalent on a weak topology of a Banach space. While this equivalence is true in general for a metric space, the weak topology is not metrizable in infinite dimensional vector spaces, and so the Eberlein‚Äì≈†mulian theorem is needed.  Applications  The Eberlein‚Äì≈†mulian theorem is important in the theory of PDEs, and particularly in Sobolev spaces. Many Sobolev spaces are reflexive Banach spaces and therefore bounded subsets are weakly precompact by Alaoglu's theorem. Thus the theorem implies that bounded subsets are weakly sequentially precompact, and therefore from every bounded sequence of elements of that space it is possible to extract a subsequence which is weakly converging in the space. Since many PDEs only have solutions in the weak sense, this theorem is an important step in deciding which spaces of weak solutions to use in solving a PDE.

Diplomatic ties between the Soviet Union and Cuba were established after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, during which the country became dependent on Soviet markets and military aid, with Cuba becoming a major ally of the USSR during the Cold War in return. In 1972 Cuba joined the COMECON, an economic organization of communist countries dominated by the large economy of the Soviet Union.

After Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, relations between both countries increased. In December 2000, Putin visited Cuba and he along with Fidel Castro called for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba. Russia is still Cuba's leading creditor and the two countries maintain close economic ties with each other. Cuba strongly supported Russia's position in the 2008 South Ossetian war. In the fall of 2008 Cuba and Russia increased joint cooperation with each other in the field of economics. Russian deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin visited Cuba several times in 2008 in order to increase economic and political ties. Russia was the first country to provide aid to Cuba after three hurricanes devastated the country in the fall of 2008. The assistance provided by Russia included four planes of food, medical supplies and construction supplies. In November 2008, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited Cuba to strengthen economic ties and to allow Russian companies to drill for oil offshore in Cuban waters, and to allow Russian mining companies to mine nickel in Cuba. Raul Castro traveled for a week-long visit to Moscow from January 28, 2009 to February 4, 2009. The talks included $20 million worth of credit to Havana, and 25,000 tons of grain as humanitarian aid to Cuba.Cuba and Russia strengthen ties as Ra√∫l Castro visits Moscow New York Times, 30 January 2009.

In 2013, Medvedev again visited Cuba in which he signed agreements on education, health, hydrometeorology, aeronautics and space technology. In July 2014, Vladimir Putin also visited Cuba, where he touted a decision to wipe clean 90 percent of the island's $35 billion debt to Moscow and announced deals to invest in Cuba's offshore oil industry.

Bray and his wife, Nancy Lyle Bray from Virginia. The was granted by Thomas Jefferson (through William Fleming) to Bray as payment for serving in the Revolutionary War and surveying what was then Virginia. It was bordered by what is now Bardstown Road, Goldsmith Lane and Hikes Lane. The original neighbors were Edward Hikes, Andrew Hikes, and John & Lucy Speed who were parents of Joshua & James Speed. Abraham Lincoln visited the area in August, 1841 for 3 weeks after breaking his engagement with Mary Todd due to her parents‚Äô disapproval of the match. The visit to Farmington and the neighboring Bray family restored his happiness and was known to be one of the happiest times of his life. The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. With . Building details The two-story home is of the same architectural style (Federal) as nearby Farmington Historic Home which was built a few years later in 1815 (and has the same setback from Bardstown Road). The house and land have seen several changes over their lifetime. A front addition to reorient the house to face Bardstown Road was created in 1820. A front porch was added in 1890. A back porch conversion from a laundry room and servant's quarters into a structure to house the latest invention (an automobile) was made in 1914. The sun-room built off the original south-facing front door was added in 1920. Parts of the property were parceled off and sold due to pressure for suburban growth after World War II. Seneca High School and Goldsmith Elementary School were built on parcels from the farm in the 1950s. More land was sold off due to demand from the ever-growing suburbs and it was eventually reduced to roughly 2 and a half acres to create a remnant green space in its suburban context. A rain garden, extensive landscaping, along with structural improvements and cosmetic enhancements were made in 2007-2008. Since Samuel Bray the house has also seen several changes in ownership: Milton Smith (President of L&N; RR)and his wife Anna in 1885; George Scoggan (1888) who turned it into a horse farm which produced several Ky Derby contestants and a Derby winner (\\"Lookout\\" in 1893); the MODYS family (1977) who had connections to Farmington & placed the home on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980; the Sanders family (1996) who helped it become a Bellarmine Showcase Home; and Cynthia Cooke (2007) who made many improvements to the land and house and turned it into Bashford Manor Bed and Breakfast (www.bashfordmanor.com). It is on the National Register of Historic Places. This home is one of the oldest surviving residences within the Louisville City limits. The structure consists of 3 sections of various construction dates which combine to create a very unusual and aesthetic architectural work. It is a significant element of the community both architecturally and historically. The original Bray dwelling was a two-story, 3 bay brick Federal structure with an asymmetric fa√ßade built c1796. The staircase in this section leads to the attic. The front door faced Beargrass Creek to the south, now leading into a 1920 sun-room addition. The main block of the house oriented to face Bardstown Road is a Federal I type structure. The construction date of this section is 1820, funded by the original Samuel Bray family. It is typical of the Federal farmhouse, with a five bay, symmetrical fa√ßade and a hall-parlor plan. The one story front porch was added c1890 by the George Scoggan family, who transformed the farm in 1888 to a horse farm/stable and thoroughbred training facility. The Victorian-style addition of c1890 is the back 1-story 3 room addition, connected on the east wall of the original structure. All parts of the house contain most of their original features, included presses that flank the fireplaces in the original section of the house. Ownership Samuel Bray died c1845. He was a merchant and land investor, farmer and legislator, serving in 1820 on the Kentucky State Legislature. The property went to his unmarried daughter, Nancy Chenoweth Bray, who held the farm until her death in the last months of the Civil War, February, 1865. The Farm was requisitioned as a Union encampment part of that time. Photos of civil war carvings on a huge old tree found on the property are featured in Mary Garry and Irma Raque's upcoming area history book. Nancy Bray's sister, Evalina Bray, married Dr. Samuel Shipp, and inherited the property in 1865, to raise their family here until selling it to neighbor Milton Smith, President of the L&N; Railroad, and wife, Annette in 1885. In 1888, the Smiths sold the farm to George Scoggan in whose family it remained until 1977. George produced many Derby contenders including the famous first winner of the Futurity in 1888, Proctor Knott, the 2:1 Derby favorite of 1889... \\"the best bred horse in America\\". A visit by Jesse James brother, Frank James, on Derby Eve 1889 to this home altered the race outcome to his advantage. Records indicate his influence on the jockey to throw the race in favor of 10:1 odds horse, Spokane. James bet $5000 to win on Spokane. The track also bet this method, while the populace bet on Proctor Knott. It was the largest attendance to date and the fastest track to date. Proctor Knott was false started twice to race an eighth mile down the track and back, then after the race began, was run against the outside rail when Spokane ran the inside rail to win by only a nose. George Scoggan's daughter, Mary, married Alonzo Jones in 1893, a year before George died, and the couple raised five children at the house. =Modern times= Several neighboring historic homes were razed after World War II for commercial and residential development, particularly in the 1970s. Betty and Robert Modys bought it in 1977 and placed it on the National Register of Historic Places in August, 1980 (Betty was the Director of Farmington, historic home of the Speed Family, north-west neighbors of the Bray Family). The home was thus saved from post war developers who could have placed 14 homes around it. This property is the last of the area's horse farm manor houses and is protected and sustainable now as a fashionable Bed & Breakfast. The Modys Family sold to the Sanders in 1996, who opened the home as the Bellarmine University Women's Council Show House that year. They recently sold the home (November 2007) to educator and preservationist, Cynthia Cooke. The Bray Family history research is still underway. Letters written extensively in the 1830s are on file in the Filson Club and more information is sought, especially location of the horse and family grave yards, the surveys discovered in the attic and family photos and stories.

It is a four-story brick Tudor Revival building with limestone trim, built in 1910 to designs by the Boston firm of Kelly and Graves. It is named for Peter Faneuil, the benefactor who gave Faneuil Hall to the city. History =Construction= The erection of the Peter Faneuil School represented an early form of urban renewal, as the area it occupies was cleared of wooden tenement housing for its construction. During most of the twentieth century school served as an elementary school for Beacon Hill and West End residents. It was the last school which serviced the Old West End neighborhood to close. =The LAB School= In 1975, the Educational Collaborative of Greater Boston (EDCO) opened The LAB (Learning about Boston) School, as a voluntary desegregation secondary school project. Seventy-five high-school students from 22 different school districts chose to attend the program which was based on a handful of majors chosen by the students, Students could opt for Dramatic Arts, Communications, Marine Biology, Environmental Studies. Adventure and History, in addition to taking elective and required courses in traditional and not so traditional subjects. At the start of each semester, students and staff spent several days at Boston University's Sargent Camp Outdoor Adventure Program to get to know one another and to participate in trust-building activities. Outdoor adventure at LAB School included a notable rappel by the students down the front of the Peter Faneuil School building. During its year and a half of existence, the students and staff published several volumes of an original, creative writing and art magazine, LAByrinths. The LAB School continued for another year as a full-time program, succeeding in creating genuine integration among students and staff. Attendance, even for the less-likely-to-succeed students was high, and reading scores soared. At its height of success, LAB School served 150 students. As state and federal funding for desegregation projects waned, LAB School ended. Several of the staff, including Bernice Lockhart, director, remained at the location, and transitioned into another, part-time EDCO project, called Metropathways. =Later uses= Between 1976 and 1989 the Peter Faneuil School changed use and housed a small college preparatory program sponsored by the University of Massachusetts named Another Course to College, or ACC. ACC, a 'back to basics' advanced program, was created as a safety net for academically strong and/or gifted students of the Boston public schools. Acceptance was based on GPA, IQ based entrance exam, and/or teacher recommendation. =Closing and reconversion= After the ACC/UMASS program was cut, the Peter Faneuil School closed. In 1994, the building was converted into apartments and expanded with a new brick fa√ßade along the Joy Street sidewalk, which turned its parking-lot forecourt into a central courtyard. Today it houses 20 affordable apartments for low-income people afflicted with the HIV/AIDS virus.\\"Joy Street Residence,\\" Rogerson.org, https://www.rogerson.org/site/joy-street-residence/ Historical recognition The Peter Faneuil School building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, and included in the Beacon Hill Historic District in 1966.

It is alleged that the 1979 Iranian revolution is a Western response to the Pahlavi's White Revolution which was intended to bring benefits to Iran and its people, but was unfavorable to the landlords, clergy and the United States and UK that feared that Iran will become independent, thus hampering their further involvement and control of Iranian petroleum.

D. dissertation, U.S. International University A sinister connection between British India, the Iranian flag created after Iranian Islamic revolution, and Khomeini's ancestry, has been put forth by some secular Iranians (generally expatriates) who opposed the revolution, according to Iranian author Hooman Majd. Khomeini's paternal grandfather was an Indian who immigrated to Iran (to the town of Khomein) in the early nineteenth century when India was a British colony. The stylized \`Allah\` (ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) on the post-Revolutionary Iranian flag, bears \\"a remarkable similarity to the symbol of the Sikhs,\\" whose historic homeland is the Punjab. Majd himself is unconvinced by the resemblance, seeing the issue instead as reflective of \\"my compatriot's love of and insatiable appetite for conspiracy theories.\\" Majd, The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, (2008), p.167-8 Khomeini has also been accused of having had a British father. According to an article in Persian Journal mentioned in Forbes.com and elsewhere, Khomeini may have been the son of British adventurer William Richard Williamson, a convert to Islam known to Arab Muslims as Haji Abdullah al-Zobair. John F. Kennedy and Democratic Party Associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas a close confidant of President John F. Kennedy confirmed the President's dislike for the Shah of Iran and remarked that the Shah \\"was not the person we could trust.\\" Douglas noted that President Kennedy hoped to overthrow the Iranian monarchy in favor of a liberal republic. Kennedy was angered by reports of that the Shah's government had been secretly funneling in cash donations to President Nixon's 1960 campaign against Kennedy. Within the first few months of office, Kennedy had suspended arms sales to Iran, diverted aid from the country, and ordered US policy towards Iran to be reevaluated. Kennedy's pressure on Iran led to escalating tensions and the rise of the Libration Movement of Iran cofounded by Mehdi Bazargan who later became a pivotal figure in the Iranian Revolution. According to historian Andrew Scott Cooper, Bazargan was inspired by Kennedy's rhetoric towards Iran. Islamic Revolution =British Petroleum= According to a book by F. William Engdahl, A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order, a conspiracy to overthrow the Shah was hatched by the British and Americans in 1978 coinciding with the Iranian Revolution. When \\"negotiations ... under way between the Shah's government and British Petroleum for renewal of the 25-year old extraction agreement ... collapsed\\". According to Engdahl, the end of the agreement meant \\"Iran appeared on the verge of independence in its oil sales policy for the first time since 1953.\\" To prevent this independence, Engdahl claims \\"American 'security' advisers to the Shah's SAVAK secret police implemented a policy of ever more brutal repression\\" against anti-Shah demonstrators, while American President Carter \\"cynically began protesting abuses of 'human rights'\\" caused by the American advisers policy. The British Petroleum company \\"reportedly\\" organized a \\"capital flight\\" from Iran,\\" and so on. =Claims by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi= Mohammad Reza Pahlavi himself asserted that, \\"If you lift up Khomeini's beard, you will find MADE IN ENGLAND written under his chin,\\" in the later days of his reign as monarch. This statement by Pahlavi was an adaptation of another saying, \\"If you lift a mullah's beard, you will find 'Made in Britain' stamped on his chin.\\"Defying the Iranian Revolution: From a Minister to the Shah to a Leader, Manouchehr Ganji, , page 37 1978 Ettela'at article On 7 January 1978,Muslim Networks from Hajj to Hip Hop, page 77, the state news agency Ettela'at also published an article accusing Khomeini of being a British agent and a \\"mad Indian poet.\\"Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran, Daniel Brumberg, University of Chicago Press, 2001, page 92 According to the article > These days thoughts turn once again to the colonialism of the black and the > red, that is to say, to old and new colonialism.

It is the left-hand portion of a double townhouse at 54‚Äì55 Beacon Street, seen in the photograph. The townhouse, built in 1808 to a design by Asher Benjamin, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 for its association with William Hickling Prescott (1796‚Äì1859), one of the nation's first historians. The house is now open for seasonal tours. It is operated by The National Society of The Colonial Dames in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts which purchased it for its headquarters in 1944. Description and history Built in 1808, the twin houses were designed by architect Asher Benjamin. Still nearly mirror images of one another, they are four stories in height and three bays wide. The outer two bays of each unit are part of a rounded bay front, delineated by pilasters rising from the top of the first story porch to the roof. The porch is supported by a Doric colonnade, and follows the line of the rounded bays. The doorways are in the innermost bays, flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight. The left side, 55 Beacon Street is named for William Hickling Prescott, a nearly blind historian from a prominent Boston family, who lived there from 1845 to 1859. Prescott had celebrated novelist William Makepeace Thackeray as a houseguest. That unit was acquired in 1944 by the Massachusetts chapter of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America for use as its headquarters, a role it still serves. The Dames restored Prescott's study to its original state in 1968, based on historical documents. The houses' original owner was James Smith Colburn, a successful Boston merchant. He commissioned Asher Benjamin to build the double town houses on land he purchased from the Mount Vernon Proprietors. Originally, the structures were free-standing and would have had a water view (before the filling of the area that is now the Boston Public Garden). They were the height of fashion in the Early Republic. Prescott purchased his house in 1845 and after his death, his wife sold it to cousins, the Dexters. They made significant changes to the house: updating the stairwell, adding an elevator and reconfiguring Prescott's library into a dining room. The house was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1964, and was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 1966, for its association with Prescott, who gained a reputation for his books on Spanish (and Spanish colonial) history. His 1837 History of the Conquest of Mexico received great acclaim both in the United States and in Europe. Due to his blindness (caused by an incident during a bar brawl), he employed researchers and secretaries to acquire documents and prepare his manuscripts.

History The division traces its history to the organization of the 5th Infantry Brigade on October 16, 1972, as a major unit of the Philippine Army pursuant to General Orders Number 153, General Headquarters, Armed Forces of the Philippines with its station located in Camp Servillano S. Aquino in San Miguel, Tarlac. Brig. Gen. Miguel M. Villamor was appointed as the Commanding General and the unit's territorial jurisdiction covered Zambales, Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, and portion of Quezon - north of Umiray River. On March 29, 1976, Col. Benjamin G. Santos took charge of the Brigade. On May 11, 1981, the 5th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was elevated and became known as the 5th Infantry Division pursuant to General Orders Number 365, GHQ, AFP to address the growing threat of the local communist movement. The 5th Infantry Division became distinguished as it spearheaded several campaigns against the local communist movement starting from the renowned Marag Valley in Cagayan, which was their sanctuary where the Headquarters of the Far North Luzon Regional Party Committee of the Northern Luzon Commission was discovered. It was also the training base of the communist forces coming from other NPA units. Marag Valley is a vast forest land extending from the foot of Mt. Siamsanderie in Luna, Apayao to the Malababie Valley in Pamplona, Cagayan. Most of the land area is thickly forested which gives an impression of ‚Äúvirginity‚Äù and settlements are found along the mighty Marag River. From 1990-1993, massive operations were launched to restore peace and order situation in the area and continued operations were pursued in the areas of Paco-Zinundungan complex in the same province to Mabiga-Poguin complex in Isabela. The campaign called for the proper orchestration and synchronization of efforts of the Army with various sector organizations and the local government. In effect, the masses started to withdraw their support from the local communist movement while several members gave up and/or surrendered to the government renouncing the bloody communist struggle. Support in urban areas fell and by 1991, they merely had some 18,000 available. The Army with the full support of various sector organizations and the local government units pressed on with the momentum to put an end to the insurgency. In an act of desperation, the communists became suspicious of its members and began a massive internal purge of the movement that killed thousands of partisans and members on accusations of being deep penetration agents and informers of the AFP. They also started to target US servicemen with their assassination teams called \\"Sparrow Units\\" but these activities only lost them yet more support. These solid gains serve today as the foundation of a very manageable security environment and an irreversible socio-economic up-trend in favor of the populace in Northern Luzon. On November 7, 1994, the home of the 5th Infantry Division was transferred to Camp Upi in Gamu, Isabela and is now called Camp Melchor F Dela Cruz. The Headquarters directs and employs three infantry brigades with its operationally controlled infantry battalions strategically positioned in the provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Kalinga, Apayao, Cagayan, Isabela, Ifugao, Quirino and Nueva Vizcaya. In an effort to contribute greatly in the prevailing peace and order situation in the country, the Division sent combat units to Mindanao, particularly in Basilan and Jolo-Sulu area to bring an end to the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group. After the 77th Infantry Battalion made a remarkable stint in the area from 1999-2001, it was replaced with the full- complement of the 53rd Division Reconnaissance Company last November 2006 to June 2007 and has significantly contributed in the hunt to destroy the notorious terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group. The stable security environment in the areas of Northern Luzon has been laboriously achieved through the years by the diligence and selfless sacrifice of the officers and men of the 5th Infantry Division, now under the leadership of MGen Pablo M Lorenzo. AFP. Mission The mission of the 5th Infantry Division is to conduct internal security operations in the Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, and Cordillera Administrative Regions to destroy the communist terrorists and other threat groups in order to establish a physically and psychologically secured environment conducive to economic development.

It is useful for computing sheaf cohomology. It was discovered by Roger Godement.  Godement construction  Given a topological space X (more generally, a topos X with enough points), and a sheaf F on X, the Godement construction for F gives a sheaf \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F) constructed as follows. For each point x\\\\in X, let F_x denote the stalk of F at x. Given an open set U\\\\subseteq X, define :\\\\operatorname{Gode}(F)(U):=\\\\prod_{x\\\\in U} F_x. An open subset U\\\\subseteq V clearly induces a restriction map \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F)(V)\\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F)(U), so \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F) is a presheaf. One checks the sheaf axiom easily. One also proves easily that \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F) is flabby, meaning each restriction map is surjective. The map \\\\operatorname{Gode} can be turned into a functor because a map between two sheaves induces maps between their stalks. Finally, there is a canonical map of sheaves F\\\\to \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F) that sends each section to the 'product' of its germs. This canonical map is a natural transformation between the identity functor and \\\\operatorname{Gode}. Another way to view \\\\operatorname{Gode} is as follows. Let X_{\\\\text{disc}} be the set X with the discrete topology. Let p \\\\colon X_{\\\\text{disc}} \\\\to X be the continuous map induced by the identity. It induces adjoint direct and inverse image functors p_* and p^{-1}. Then \\\\operatorname{Gode} = p_* \\\\circ p^{-1}, and the unit of this adjunction is the natural transformation described above. Because of this adjunction, there is an associated monad on the category of sheaves on X. Using this monad there is a way to turn a sheaf F into a coaugmented cosimplicial sheaf. This coaugmented cosimplicial sheaf gives rise to an augmented cochain complex that is defined to be the Godement resolution of F. In more down-to-earth terms, let G_0(F) = \\\\operatorname{Gode}(F), and let d_0\\\\colon F\\\\rightarrow G_0(F) denote the canonical map. For each i>0, let G_i(F) denote \\\\operatorname{Gode}(\\\\operatorname{coker}(d_{i-1})), and let d_i\\\\colon G_{i-1}\\\\rightarrow G_i denote the canonical map. The resulting resolution is a flabby resolution of F, and its cohomology is the sheaf cohomology of F.

He participated as a sergeant in the suppression of the uprising of the samurai in 1877 under the leadership of Saig≈ç Takamori.

Tsuda swung his saber at Nicholas, aiming at his head, but Nicholas turned and the blow grazed his head. Nicholas II was injured but survived. The attempt left a 9-centimeter scar on his head. At the trial, Tsuda indicated that he had attempted to assassinate Nicholas because he suspected that he was a Russian spy. On May 25, 1891, Tsuda was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he had to serve in Hokkaido, often called \\"the Japanese Siberia\\". However, on September 30 of that year, Tsuda died in prison from pneumonia. According to another version, he starved himself to death.

It was the flagship store of the Filene's department store chain. The building has been renovated and now serves as the offices for Havas and Arnold Worldwide. The building is maintained as part of the Millennium Tower. It is now home to fast fashion retailer, Primark. History =Development and use= Filene's in an early 20th-century postcard The building was completed in 1912 as a new flagship location for William Filene and Sons' department store, better known as Filene's. By 1929 Filene's expanded the flagship building, converting the whole block around Washington, Summer, Hawley and Franklin streets into one department store. This was the last major project by legendary Chicago architect Daniel Burnham and his only work in Boston. This building was widely regarded as one of the best examples of Beaux Arts architecture in Boston. In 1986, the Filene's Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Filene's stores were merged with Macy's phasing out the Filene's name. In a normal store merger, the old stores are converted into the new stores. But this was a problem in Boston, because the Filene's building was located across the street from another Macy's store. When Filene's did close, the Boston Landmarks Commission unanimously voted to protect two of the historic buildings that housed Filene's in Boston. The two oldest buildings were protected including the main 1912 Filene's store building and a 1905 former glassware and china seller's building on the opposite corner. Two newer buildings, built in 1951 and 1973, were not protected, and were demolished in 2008. =Sale and refurbishment= After the store closed, the building was marketed and was eventually bought by Vornado Realty Trust of New York. Vornado teamed up with Gale International for a $700 million redevelopment of the Filene's site. The project contained a 39-story tower including a 280-room hotel, 125-seat restaurant, of office space, 166 residential condos, of retail space, and an adjacent park. Although the Filene's Building is protected by the Landmarks Commission, it only protected the facade of the buildings. This allowed the developers of the site to rip out the building's interior, leaving the exterior to stand on its own. However, when the project ran out of money, the site was left completely gutted and missing walls from the razed 1951 and 1973 additions. The city of Boston eventually revoked the permit on the project. The site was taken over by another developer, Millennium Partners of New York. Plans include of retail on the lower floors and nearly office space on the upper floors, including a restoration of many original architectural details. The project also includes a glass tower next door, which will contain 450 luxury residences and another of retail space. Irish clothing company Primark opened its first U.S. store September 10, 2015, on the first four floors of the restored Burnham Building; Roche Bros. supermarket occupies the basement, with an additional grab-and-go shop at street level on Summer Street.

Two years later, the ministry was expanded to include domestic trade within Egypt and was renamed the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). He has been described as the first businessman ever to hold a cabinet position in Egypt and as a reformer.Zakaria, Fareed. Interview with Rachid on the television show Global Public Square, CNN, 6 February 2011 On 1 February 2011, during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, Rachid traveled to Dubai. Following the downfall of the Mubarak regime, Rachid was tried in absentia,  Education  Rachid received his BSc in Mechanical Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering at Alexandria University in 1978. He has attended a number of management programs in the United States, including the Management Development Program at Stanford University in 1983, the Strategic Management Program at the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1993, and the six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 1996.  Career  Prior to joining government, Rachid had an entrepreneurial and multinational career. He established and grew Fine Foods to become Egypt's leading foods brand. In 1991, a joint venture was formed with Unilever establishing Unilever Mashreq. He was later appointed as President of Unilever's Middle East, North Africa and Turkey businesses based out of London. As minister, Rachid was a member of the government's new 'economic team' tasked with delivering a program of reforms to open Egypt up to international trade and investment. As Minister of Trade and Industry, his mandate included liberalizing Egypt's industrial sectors, attracting foreign direct investment into industry, and creating jobs. He is responsible for Egypt's foreign trade portfolio, managing Egypt's network of preferential trade agreements (with United States, Europe, Africa and the Middle East) and growing Egyptian exports. Rachid also oversees Egypt's internal trade market and is responsible for the creation of Egypt's first Competition and Consumer Protection Authorities. As minister, Rachid pioneered a new form of public- private partnership in Egypt by involving members of the private sector in the government policy formulation process. Rachid also worked to harmonize Egypt's industrial policies with its international commitments and thus enable Egyptian industrialists and traders to benefit from Egypt's existing trade agreements. During his time as minister, the following trade agreements were signed: *The Qualifying Industrial Zones Protocol (QIZs), which allows Egyptian-made products quota- and duty-free access to the US market provided they contain 10.5 percent Israeli content. *The Egypt-Turkey Free Trade Agreement, which allows products made in Egypt and Turkey duty-free access to the respective markets. *The Egypt-EFTA (the European Free Trade Area) Free Trade Agreement, which gives products manufactured in Egypt and the EFTA- member countries, which include Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland, privileged access to other members' markets. The Egyptian cabinet was dismissed at the end of January 2011, after widespread public protests against the government, and then Rachid no longer held a ministerial position. Shortly afterward, Egyptian prosecutors froze his assets and prevented him from traveling, though he had already left the country by this time.Zacharia, Janine. Mubarak ally watches Egypt from uncertain exile The Washington Post. 3 March 2011 Rachid was tried in absentia on charges of embezzlement and squandering public funds. He was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, and ordered to repay 1.57 million US dollars, approximately 9.385 million Egyptian pounds.Jail for former Egyptian trade minister Al Jazeera. 25 June 2011Egypt jails former trade minister Rachid in absentia BBC News. 25 June 2011. Weeks later he was sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison on corruption charges and fined an additional 1.4 billion Egyptian pounds. In 2016 Rachid reached a deal with Egypt's Asset Recovery Committee after he was able to prove his finances and investments existed prior to his appointment to the Ministry in 2004.

They started writing songs together and performing short concerts. White was working in a boutique with a Chinese girl called \\"Ting Ting\\", which sounds like Mandarin Chinese for \\"band stand\\" (‰∫≠) and White used it as name for the band. One transliteration of the band's name in Japanese is a slang word for penis (wikt:„Å°„Çì„Å°„Çì). The Ting Tings started by playing for private parties at the Islington Mill arts centre in Salford and their debut album, We Started Nothing, was released on 19 May 2008.

Despite using the same chassis code, it was not related to the W112 series of limousines and coupes of the 1960s. The C112 was intended to be the road-legal counterpart of the Sauber-built C11 Group C prototype race car developed for the 1990 World Sports-Prototype Championship. Features and specifications The C112 was equipped with the new 6.0-litre (5,987cc) M120 V12 engine, with peak power of and peak torque of . The body was built by the Italian coach builder Carrozzeria Coggiolo on the chassis supplied by Mercedes-Benz. The use of pop- up headlamps, a common feature on sports cars at that time was avoided as it increased drag and created aerodynamic turbulence, two fixed units with clear lenses and transparent fairings were used while the fog lamps and indicator lamps were integrated into the front bumper, made from Kevlar. An electronically controlled front spoiler was integrated into the funnel-shaped underwing inlet located under the front bumper's air-intake. A notable feature of the car were the gullwing doors, giving a nod to the iconic 300 SL. Door opening was servo-assisted by hydraulic cylinders positioned under the roof. The doors were designed in such a way that they could be bent open in case of a roll-over. The rear body work consisted of a simple hinged engine cover atop the riveted aluminium panels that allowed for easier repair work, a massive tail lamp array along with Kevlar venturi tunnels and a smooth rear bumper with integrated exhaust tips completed the rear look. In order to keep the aerodynamic drag low, only three air-inlets were utilised: one in each flank in addition to that integrated into the nose. The flank intakes supplied air to the engine bay through a radiator which cooled the engine oil with a portion of the air was channelled to the rear brakes. The nose inlet supplied air to the front brakes and to the water radiator. A smooth aerodynamic body along with the use of wing mirrors mounted of the A-pillar gave the car a drag co-efficient of 0.30, the lowest ever on a sports car at that time. The front spoiler and the rear wing controlled the lift generated due to the low drag coefficient. A light weight bonded aluminium chassis weighing was utilised, strengthened by a tubular steel sub-frame for the doors and the roof, this measure also increased rigidity. The 6-speed manual transmission transferring power to the rear wheels was specially developed for the C112 by Mercedes- Benz. The suspension system was a multi-link unit utilised from the Mercedes- Benz 190-series. The special 5-spoke magnesium wheels were built by Speedline and measured 18-inches at the front and rear, wrapped in tyres supplied by Goodyear and Michelin. The brakes were ventilated cast iron units with four- piston callipers at the front and rear supplied by Brembo. Other features included a luxurious leather interior carried over from the S-class, air- conditioning, heated adjustable leather seats, climate control, GPS navigation system, power steering, ABS brakes, electronic rear-wheel steering dubbed the 'cybernetic' steering (a novelty at that time) and a Becker 2000 Mexico cassette radio. The major systems demonstrated in the car were: ;Active Body Control Active Body Control was designed to control the vehicle's stability through a combination of active springs and hydraulics at each wheel, plus sensors that monitor the vehicle's movements. The vehicle's computer assesses the information from the sensors and adjusts the suspension accordingly. ;Other systems The most recent updates in anti-locking braking (ABS) and anti- skid control system (ASR) which split the braking pressure between the front and rear wheels ;Active Aerodynamics This was provided through the car's front spoiler and rear wing, which were electronically controlled to ensure the optimal combination of low drag and high downforce. The rear wing was also used to improve the car's braking in emergency situations although this was not seen in production until the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. Even though Mercedes-Benz received 700 orders for the car, it never went into production as it was determined by Mercedes-Benz executives that a flagship car wasn't needed to increase the attention drawn to the brand as it was already being done by motorsport successes. Performance The C112 could theoretically accelerate from in 4.9 seconds and could attain a maximum speed of . At its maximum speed, the C112 was claimed to generate a downforce of . These performance figures were never tested as the car was never driven.

In the 19th century Cork city had a population of the order of 80,000 and was served by up to five operating companies, mostly to separate stations around the city. Street Railways Train traversing Cork City Railways by Albert Quay As well as street railways and tramways in the central area of Cork city, the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway also had street lines running through the western suburbs, later shared with trams. =Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company= The Cork trams started in 1898 and ran until 1931. The gauge of was designed to be compatible with that of the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway so it could operate over some of the light railways route. The tram network also linked to the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway the gauge of which was reduced from to at this time for compatibility. =Cork City Railways= The Cork City Railways were constructed in 1911 and opened in 1912 to connect the Irish standard gauge systems north and south of the River Lee in Cork, Ireland. Half the finance of ¬£150,000 for the Company was put forward by the Great Western Railway (GWR) company of the United Kingdom who had previously invested in the Fishguard, Rosslare and Waterford route. Three of the four company directors were also from the GWR.The company owned no locomotives and the system was operated by other railway companies. There were two lines, the first starting west from Glanmire Road station before curving to cross the two channels of the River Lee, and the electric tramway, to pass by Cork Albert Quay railway station and join the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway CBSCR immediately thereafter. This line had various branches to docks. This line may briefly have had a scheduled passenger service in the summer of 1914. The second line ran from the CBSCR goods yard to Victoria Quays. Usage of the Cork City Railways lines reduced with the closure of the old CBSCR route in 1961; however, freight movements to Albert and Victoria Quays continued until 1976, leaving only a few tracks close to Glanmire Road. Train operating companies in Cork City = Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway = The Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway did not start from Cork. Instead, in 1849, they opened the first section between Bandon and Ballinhassig in December 1849. After financial problems, they reached Cork Albert Quay two years later, after completion of the Ballinhassig tunnel and the Chetwynd Viaduct. As the company extended, it was possible to travel the mainline to Bantry, and branches to Kinsale, Clonakilty and Baltimore, and by narrow-gauge from Skibereen to Schull. The first major closure was the branch line to Kinsale, which closed in 1931. The remaining majority of the system closed in March 1961, with the track lifted from March 1962 onwards. = Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway = Cork Albert Street opened in 1873, replacing the earlier 1850 Victoria Road terminus at City Park. The station served the line to Passage West, with later extensions to Carrigaline and Crosshaven. The line was originally 5ft 3in gauge but was converted to 3ft gauge in 1898. It closed in 1932. = Cork and Macroom Direct Railway = Cork Capwell, opened 30.09.1879, closed 02.03.1925, was the terminus for the Cork and Macroom Direct Railway. It was situated close to the CBSC and CBP stations. = Cork and Muskerry Light Railway = The Cork and Muskerry Light Railway had its terminus Cork Western Road towards the west of the city centre, near the banks of the River Lee. From Western Road, it was possible to travel from Cork to the region of Muskerry, with destinations including Coachford, Blarney and later Donoughmore. The terminus was open from 08.08.1887 to 31.12.1934. = Cork and Youghal Railway = Cork Summerhill was the original terminus of the C&Y;, but when it was taken over by the G&SW;, they created a combined station at Cork Glanmire Road for through workings. = Great Southern and Western Railway = Cork Penrose Quay was the original station, which was replaced by Cork Glanmire Road on amalgamation with the Cork and Youghal Railway. The Glanmire Road station is the only station that remains open for passenger or freight traffic, and is still connected to the main Cork-Dublin line via the mid-19th century Kilnap Viaduct and associated tunnel. On the 50th anniversary of the Easter Uprising, Glanmire Road station was renamed Cork Kent Station after Thomas Kent.

Russia has an embassy in Ashgabat and a consulate- general in T√ºrkmenba≈üy. Turkmenistan has an embassy in Moscow. Recently, Russian‚ÄìTurkmenistan relations have revolved around Russia's efforts to secure natural gas export deals from Turkmenistan. Russia is competing with China, the European Union, and the United States for access to Turkmenistan's rich supply of hydrocarbons. The two countries often lock horns over price negotiations for gas exports to Russia. Turkmen president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow has agreed to help supply and expand the Russian-backed Pricaspiysky pipeline, however no action has yet occurred towards this goal.  2008 meeting  Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedow in Ashgabat on 4 July 2008. Dmitry Medvedev and Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov discussed the prospects of further expanding their trade and economic ties. Particular attention was given to cooperation in energy and transport. The parties reviewed the implementation of multilateral agreements on the construction of Caspian gas pipeline and the development of existing gas transportation facilities in Central Asia. They also discussed the organisation of a direct rail-ferry service starting from the port of Astrakhan. The parties exchanged views on important international and regional issues, and cooperation between Russia and Turkmenistan within the framework of international organisations. Following high-level talks between Russia and Turkmenistan the parties adopted a Joint Declaration. The document states that the two presidents confirm the strategic nature of relations between Russia and Turkmenistan and stress that these relations are gradually developing in a wide range of areas. A number of documents were signed in the presence of the heads of state. In particular, the Agreement on Cooperation between the Governments of Russia and Turkmenistan on the Protection of Classified Information. The countries' ministries of culture signed a Memorandum of Cooperation and an Agreement on Cooperation in Education. The countries' ministries of foreign affairs signed a cooperation programme for 2008-2009. The presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan also made statements to the press. Speaking at the opening ceremony, President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his hope that cooperation between Turkmenistan and Russia will develop, and stressed that Russia is always open to meaningful and committed partnership. The presidents toured the new centre, accompanied by the chief executive of KamAZ, Sergei Kogogin. The head of the company described the technical features of the vehicles, noting in particular that they are capable of working in temperatures ranging from minus 45 to plus 50 degrees. The open joint stock company KamAZ is Russia's largest automotive corporation. Its vehicles account for 36 percent of the Russian market. It has assembly plants in six foreign countries: Poland, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Ethiopia and Vietnam. One of its affiliated companies has been working in Turkmenistan since May 2006. To ensure warranty and post-warranty service a temporary centre in Ashgabat has been opened. The servicing of vehicles is done by experts from the KamAZ factory. The new service centre was founded in May 2007. It houses not only a working area but also classrooms and offices.

At the bottom of the figure the light can be seen diffracting through a grating, and this exact pattern is reproduced at the top of the picture (one Talbot length away from the grating). Halfway down you see the image shifted to the side, and at regular fractions of the Talbot length the sub-images are clearly seen. The Talbot effect is a diffraction effect first observed in 1836 by Henry Fox Talbot.H. F. Talbot 1836 \\"Facts relating to optical science\\" No. IV, Phil. Mag. 9 When a plane wave is incident upon a periodic diffraction grating, the image of the grating is repeated at regular distances away from the grating plane. The regular distance is called the Talbot length, and the repeated images are called self images or Talbot images. Furthermore, at half the Talbot length, a self-image also occurs, but phase-shifted by half a period (the physical meaning of this is that it is laterally shifted by half the width of the grating period). At smaller regular fractions of the Talbot length, sub-images can also be observed. At one quarter of the Talbot length, the self-image is halved in size, and appears with half the period of the grating (thus twice as many images are seen). At one eighth of the Talbot length, the period and size of the images is halved again, and so forth creating a fractal pattern of sub images with ever-decreasing size, often referred to as a Talbot carpet. Talbot cavities are used for coherent beam combination of laser sets.  Calculation of the Talbot length  Lord Rayleigh showed that the Talbot effect was a natural consequence of Fresnel diffraction and that the Talbot length can be found by the following formula:Lord Rayleigh 1881 \\"On copying diffraction gratings and on some phenomenon connected therewith\\" Phil. Mag. 11 :z_\\\\text{T}=\\\\frac{2a^2}{\\\\lambda}, where a is the period of the diffraction grating and \\\\lambda is the wavelength of the light incident on the grating. However, if wavelength \\\\lambda is comparable to grating period a, this expression may lead to errors in z_\\\\text{T} up to 100%. In this case the exact expression derived by Lord Rayleigh should be used: :z_\\\\text{T}=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1 - \\\\sqrt{ 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2}{a^2} }}. =Fresnel number of the finite size Talbot grating= The number of Fresnel zones N_f that form first Talbot self-image of the grating with period p and transverse size N \\\\cdot a is given by exact formula N_f=N^2. This result is obtained via exact evaluation of Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral in the near field at distance z_T=\\\\frac{2 a^2}{ \\\\lambda}. The atomic Talbot effect Due to the quantum mechanical wave nature of particles, diffraction effects have also been observed with atoms‚Äîeffects which are similar to those in the case of light. Chapman et al. carried out an experiment in which a collimated beam of sodium atoms was passed through two diffraction gratings (the second used as a mask) to observe the Talbot effect and measure the Talbot length. The beam had a mean velocity of corresponding to a de Broglie wavelength of \\\\lambda_\\\\text{dB} = . Their experiment was performed with 200 and gratings which yielded Talbot lengths of 4.7 and respectively. This showed that for an atomic beam of constant velocity, by using \\\\lambda_\\\\text{dB}, the atomic Talbot length can be found in the same manner. Nonlinear Talbot effect The nonlinear Talbot effect results from self-imaging of the generated periodic intensity pattern at the output surface of the periodically poled LiTaO3 crystal. Both integer and fractional nonlinear Talbot effects were investigated. In cubic nonlinear Schr√∂dinger's equation i\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\psi^2 \\\\psi = 0, nonlinear Talbot effect of rogue waves is observed numerically.

Any code that runs on i586 but does not use floating point instructions will run on these models. Any i586 code will run on Vortex86DX and later. Some Linux kernels (by build-time option) emulate the FPU on any CPU that is missing one, so a program that uses i586-level floating point instructions will work on any Vortex86 family CPU under such a kernel, albeit more slowly on a model with no FPU. The more advanced models have FPUs that have i686-level instructions, such as fucomi. Code intended for i686 may fail on some models because they lack a Conditional Move (CMOV) instruction. Compilers asked to optimize code for a more advanced CPU (for example the GNU Compiler with its -march=i686 option) generate code that uses CMOV. Linux systems intended to run on i686 are generally not compatible with these Vortex86 models because the GNU C Library, when built for i686, uses a CMOV instruction in its assembly language strcmp function, which its dynamic loader (ld.so) uses.

Background The Soviet Union and UAE established diplomatic relations on 8 December 1971. In 1986, the Soviet embassy in Abu Dhabi was opened and the UAE embassy in Moscow was opened in 1987. Modern relations Russia has an embassy in Abu Dhabi and UAE has an embassy in Moscow. In 2002, a Russian consulate-general in Dubai was established. The UAE was alone in the Gulf Cooperation Council in endorsing the 2015 Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, describing it as against a \\"common enemy\\" of the two nations. During 2017, UAE has sought to drive a wedge between Russia and its ally, Iran, which the UAE has a poor relationship with. Along with Saudi Arabia and Israel, the UAE encouraged the United States to remove sanctions on Russia pertaining to its activity in Ukraine in exchange for Russian assistance in ending the Iranian military presence in Syria. UAE is backing the House of Representatives (Libya) in the Libyan Civil War (2014‚Äìpresent), and Russian mercenary group Wagner Group is working for House of Representatives.

However, no licences have been issued since 1975. In modern Lebanon prostitution takes place semi- officially via 'super night clubs', and illegally on the streets, in bars, hotels and brothels. UNAIDS estimate there to be 4,220 prostitutes in the country. Cases of child prostitution are known and prosecuted, but no measures are taken to rehabilitate these juveniles.Child Prostitution ‚Äì Lebanon. Gvnet.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-30. Sex trafficking is a problem in the Lebanon. Overview Street prostitution occurs in the country, the prostitutes are mainly Lebanese or Syrian. Prostitution also occurs in 'bars', especially in the Hamra area of Beirut and in Maameltein. The bars are licensed, but not for prostitution. They usually have 'secret' rooms at the back and the women, mostly Egyptians, Syrians and Sudanese, are controlled by a \\"Mom\\". They keep their liquor licenses and a blind eye is turned to the illegal activities because of bribes to the police. Some Lebanese prostitutes work independently from hotels or rented apartments. Male prostitution is on the rise in the country. =Super night clubs= Super night clubs serve as places of introduction between prostitutes and clients. The clients may chat with an 'artiste' if they buy a bottle of champagne. During the chat a 'date' may be arranged for the next day. No sexual services are permitted on the premises, and the woman negotiates her own price for the 'date'. The clubs operate with the implicit consent of the S√ªret√© G√©n√©rale (General Directorate of General Security), who set strict regulations. The women working in the clubs must be foreign nationals, Lebanese women are not allowed in the clubs. The migrant women must have a contract to enter the country, and are issued with an 'artiste' visa, to which strict conditions are attached. The women must be at the club between 8pm to 5am, S√ªret√© or police may enter the club at any time to check the artistes are all present. The women must live in a hotel room, often adjacent to or in the same building as the club. They must be in the hotel between finishing work (5am) until 1pm. After 1pm they may leave the hotel on a 'date'. The telephone number and car registration number of the client must be recorded when the women leave the hotel. There are about 130 clubs, mainly in Maameltein. Many of the women working in them are of East European and North African origin. 11,284 women entered Lebanon under the 'artiste' program in 2016, more than double the number of women that entered under this program in 2015. Their artiste visas do not exceed six months, and they are deported if they are caught overstaying their visa. History In 1931, whilst the country was under French control, a new law regulated prostitution. Prostitutes needed to be registered and were only allowed to work in licensed brothels. To obtain a licence they had to be over 21, not be a virgin and have undergone a medical examination. The law criminalised working anywhere else. It also criminalised anybody facilitating working outside licence requirements. At the start of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, all of the licensed brothels were located near Martyrs' Square in the Zeitoun district of downtown Beirut. All these brothels were destroyed during the fighting. No licences have been issued since to prostitutes or brothels. As a result of licences not being issued, brothels operated illegally until a new law was passed in 1998 criminalising businesses making rooms available for commercial sex. The \\"super night clubs\\" were originally regular night clubs catering to the tourist trade in the 1960s. They closed down during the Civil War, and after the end of the war there were insufficient tourists to make them viable. The business model was changed to its current format and the clubs reopened. Syrian Civil War The Civil War in Syria has led to an influx of Syrian refugees into the sex trade in Lebanon. Syrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Some adult refugee women have been coerced into prostitution. A forced prostitution ring, run by a Syrian pimp, was dismantled in 2016 by Lebanese police, which raided the Chez Maurice and le Silver brothels, both located in the Maameltein, known for its red- light district. The majority of the women and girls were recruited from Syria with false promises of work and subjected to commercial sexual exploitation where they experienced mental, physical, and sexual abuse and forced abortions. Sex trafficking Lebanon is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking and a transit country for Eastern European women and children subjected to sex trafficking in other Middle Eastern countries. Women from Eastern Europe and North Africa enter Lebanon to work in the adult entertainment industry through Lebanon's artiste visa program, which sustains a significant commercial sex industry and enables sex trafficking. Some women from East and West Africa are subjected to sex trafficking in Lebanon. Syrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Syrian girls are brought to Lebanon for sex trafficking, sometimes through the guise of early marriage. Lebanese pimps coerce some Syrian LGBTI refugees into prostitution. The 2011 anti-trafficking law prohibits all forms of human trafficking. Prescribed penalties for sex trafficking range from five to 15 years imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. In 2016, the internal security forces (ISF) anti-trafficking unit investigated 20 cases of suspected trafficking, involving 87 victims of sexual exploitation and child trafficking, and referred 26 suspected traffickers to the judiciary. The directorate of general security (DGS) investigated 14 potential trafficking cases involving artiste visa holders and four were referred to judicial or law enforcement authorities for further investigation. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Lebanon as a 'Tier 2' country.

Biography Archbishop Sebouh was born on March 24, 1959 in Malatya, Turkey. He received his primary education at the Nersisian College of Istanbul. In 1969, his family repatriated to Armenia and settled in the city of Gyumri, where he continued and finished his primary education. In 1978 he entered the Gevorkian Theological Seminary at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. He was ordained to the diaconate in 1985, by the Grand Sacristan of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, Archbishop Hoosik Santourian. He successfully defended his final thesis entitled \\"The Translation Works of Lukas of Kharpert\\" in March 1986. Upon his graduation from the seminary he was appointed to serve in the Secretariat of the Pontifical Administration. He was ordained as a celibate priest by Archbishop Nerses Pozapalian on June 7, 1987, the Feast of Pentecost, and given the priestly name Sebouh. Following his ordination, he continued his service in the Pontifical Administration. By the appointment of Vazgen I, Catholicos of All Armenians, he served as the Vice Dean of the Gevorkian Theological Seminary at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin in September 1987. In November 1989, he successfully defended his doctoral thesis entitled ‚ÄúThe Fast in the Armenian Apostolic Church,‚Äù and received the rank of Archimandrite (Vardapet). In 1990, Vazgen I appointed Father Sebouh to serve as the spiritual pastor of the Armenians of Geneva, Switzerland. He returned to Armenia in 1991 to serve as the Vicar of the Diocese of Shirak. After Armenia gained independence, vast administrative tasks were placed on the Armenian Church. In the summer of 1993, Father Sebouh worked closely with Archbishop Hovnan Derderian (the then primate of the Diocese of Canada) and Ronald Alepian to organize the first mission of Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia (CYMA). In June 1995, Father Sebouh was appointed to serve as the Director of the Reserve Stewardship Inventory Committee of the Armenian Church. Also in that same year, he was appointed to serve as the Director of the committee responsible for tracking the return and receipt of all previously confiscated church buildings, land and construction projects (most of the churches, buildings, structures and properties belonging to the Church had been seized by the State during the time of the Soviet Regime). In 1996, he served as the representative of the Armenian Church on the Humanitarian Aid Central Committee of Armenia. On June 3, 1996, by the Pontifical Encyclical of the Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians, he was appointed to serve as the Primate of the Diocese of Gougark. Father Chouldjian was consecrated as bishop by Catholicos Karekin I on June 15, 1997. He was a member of the Supreme Spiritual Council of the Armenian Church during 2000‚Äì2007.

Archbishop Sebouh Chouldjian presently serves as the Primate of the Diocese of Gougark in Armenia. Co-Patriarch Candidacy (2010) Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian was one of the three candidates for the Co-Patriarch at the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2010. Mesrop II Mutafyan, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in July 2008, and was incapable of running the Patriarchate since then. This led the Armenian community to a painful condition of uncertainty. In late 2009, the Patriarchate's Religious Council wrote to the Turkish government seeking permission to elect a coadjutor (co-Patriarch). Three bishops stated that they were going to run for the elections: Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian, Archbishop Karekin Bekchian ‚Äì the Primate of the Armenian Church Diocese of Germany, and Archbishop Aram Ateshian ‚Äì the chairman of the Supreme Spiritual Council of the Patriarchate of Istanbul. Among the main ideas proposed by Bishop Sebouh as a candidate was that the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople should become a spiritual and cultural bridge among Yerevan, Ankara and the Armenian Diaspora. He paid particular attention to the importance of dialogue among Armenians and between Turkish and Armenian people.' On February 10‚Äì17, 2010 Bishop Sebouh visited Istanbul, Turkey to have meetings with the Armenian community of Istanbul. During his meetings and interviews he urged to continue Hrant Dink's way (i.e. dialogue between Armenian and Turkish people) and keep Armenian Patriarchate free from politics..., Google Translation On June 29, 2010 the government of Turkey made a decision to reject the request of the Armenian community of Turkey to allow co-patriarch elections. The Turkish Government said that they did not find the elections of either patriarch or co-patriarch reasonable and allowed carrying out only the elections of Patriarchal Locum Tenens. Hours later Archbishop Shahan Svajian ‚Äì the that time Locum Tenens, resigned and the Spiritual council of the Patriarchate elected Archbishop Aram Ateshian a new Patriarchal Locum Tenens. However, according to some experts, the Armenian Community of Turkey was inclined to elect Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian (citizen of Armenia) as their spiritual leader which was disallowed by the Turkish government after unsuccessful negotiations of Armenia-Turkey reconciliation. Later, in his letter to the Armenian Community of Turkey from July 15, 2010 Bishop Sebouh mentioned that interference of Turkey's Government was in contradiction with the adopted new policy on dealing with ethnic minorities. \\"We continue to hope that this is not the manner of actions of Erdoƒüan's government, but that of the stationary state sub-agencies, which hamper the democratic development of Turkey with their old mentality\\". Bishop Sebouh said it was the moral obligation of Archbishop Aram Ateshian to send a new letter to the Turkey's Government with request to hold the elections of Co-Patriarch. Protests were raised within the Armenian community, though it was hardly possible to hold new patriarch elections as long as the current patriarch Mesrop II was alive., pp. 58‚Äì59 The \\"We Want to Elect Our Own Patriarch Initiative\\" remained active and held silent protests in Armenian churches on Sundays. Archbishop Sebouh occasionally visited Turkey and expressed his position and opinion on issues warring the community., Google translate Patriarch Candidacy (2016) 2016 gave rise to a newSee 2014 status update coverage at wave of demands to eventually elect the head of the Armenian Church in Turkey. In spring 2016 two of the four main candidates, Archbishop Sebouh and Archbishop Karekin Bekdjian urged that there be patriarch election \\"now\\". Archbishop Sebouh declared, that should there be election of patriarch there was no obstacle for him to be a candidate. \\"If the society finds me qualified for solving the problems of Armenian society and the patriarchate, I am ready to serve by considering it as a holy duty,\\" he said. In June, 2016 a group of Turkish Armenians protested in front of the Armenian Patriarchate against being denied the right to replace acting Locum Tenens Aram Ate≈üyan whose reputation was compromised after his letter to president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, wherein he criticized a recent decision by the German Bundestag recognizing the World War I-era killings of Anatolian Armenians. In October, 2016 the Clerical Assembly of the Armenian Patriarchate of Turkey decided to superannuate the Patriarch Mesrob II on the ground that he has been unable to perform his duty for 7 years and announced that there will be an application for starting the election process. Honors and awards Archbishop Sebouh is member of the Armenian branch of the International Academy of Natural and Social Sciences (since 2000). He holds Fridtjof Nansen Golden Medal (2005), Republic of Armenia Prime Minister's Medal for vast contribution in development of state-church relations (2006),Republic of Armenia Prime Minister's Decision No 406‘± from June 9, 2006 on awarding Republic of Armenia's Prime Minister's Medal Hayrenik Gold Medal (2010). On March 24, 2009, Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Tigran Sargsyan warmly congratulated Archbishop Sebouh on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of birthday. In his message he emphasized Bishop Sebouh's input in organizing Christian education, revivification of church life and restoration of ethnic and spiritual identity of the Armenian nation.

On 8 October 1980, Syria and the Soviet Union signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. The treaty runs for twenty years and has automatic five-year extensions, unless one of the parties terminates the agreement. It provides for regular consultations on bilateral and multilateral issues of interest, coordination of responses in the event of a crisis, and military cooperation.Relations with the Soviet Union The treaty remains in force to this day. In January 1992, the Syrian government recognized the Russian Federation as the legal successor to the Soviet Union. Russia in 2011 and 2012 used its veto-power in the United Nations Security Council against resolutions promoted by Western and Arab countries, to prevent possible sanctions or military intervention against the Syrian government, and Russia continued supplying large amounts of arms that Syria's government had earlier contracted to buy and which were used to fight Western-backed rebels.Why Russia is willing to sell arms to Syria By Fred Weir csmonitor.com 19 January 2012 On 30 September 2015, Russia began a military intervention in the Syrian Civil War in support of the al-Assad government, consisting of air strikes against terrorist groups: e.g. ISIS. Political relations =Before 1944= In 1893, the Russian Empire established a consular office in Damascus, then a part of Ottoman Syria. Following the October Revolution (1917), and the creation of the Soviet Union (1922), the Russian presence in Syria came to an end, which continued during the French Mandate period (1923‚àí1946). Although the Soviet Union did not play a political role in the region, it did promote the establishment of the Syrian‚ÄìLebanese Communist Party in 1924. =1944‚Äì1958= Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Syria were established in July 1944. The Soviet Union commenced to again take an interest in the Middle East after the Second World War. The two countries signed a secret agreement on 1 February 1946, with Soviet minister to Syria and Lebanon Daniel Solod as signatory for the USSR, in which the Soviet Union agreed to provide military help in the formation of the Syrian Arab Army and prescribed Soviet diplomatic and political support in the international arena. The Soviet Union demonstrated its commitment to this treaty with Andrey Vyshinsky's 15 February 1946 address to the United Nations Security Council calling for the removal of British and French troops from the country. The last French troops were removed from Syria on 17 April 1946. During the Cold War (1947‚Äì1991) a stronger political bond developed, and Syria was considered an ally to the Soviet Union in opposition to the Western powers. In 1949, after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Syria experienced a number of military coups and the rise of the Ba'ath Party. Three coups d'√©tat occurred by 1953, ushering in military dictatorships twice in the process. A non-aggression pact was signed on 10 April 1950 further cemented Soviet‚ÄìSyrian ties. During the Cold War period, each conflict and war that broke out in the Middle East acted as a factor leading Syria to form closer ties with the Soviet Union. Following the military coup d‚Äô√©tat of 25 February 1954, the Ba'ath Party came to the fore in Syrian politics. The West-inspired Baghdad Pact (1955), with its ultimately unsuccessful formation of the Central Treaty Organization, brought Soviet- Syria relations closer diplomatically. In early 1956, Syria made an arms deal with the USSR. After that, during 1956, various teams of Syrians went to Eastern Bloc countries Czechoslovakia, Poland and USSR - for arms, artillery, Mig-17 training courses for pilot and ground crew. Many Syrian officers and NCOs also underwent courses led by Czechoslovak instructors in Egypt beginning in March 1956, including training for 122-mm cannons, SU-100 anti-tank guns, and T-34 tanks, among other weaponry. Meanwhile, teams from Eastern Bloc countries came to Syria to provide training to Syrian military. Syrians however perceived this agreement as a pact against themselves. Indeed, among the consequences of the Baghdad Pact was not only a deepening of Syrian relations with the Soviet Union but also an alignment of Middle Eastern countries into allied satellites of the Eastern and Western blocs. The response of the Soviet Union to the Suez Crisis (late October 1956) - threatening to use 'destructive weapons' against Britain and France - increased Soviet prestige in the Middle East. The Syrian President, then in USSR, requested the Soviet government to intervene and send its pilots to increase the morale of the Arabs. Syrian Foreign Minister, in a talk with Soviet Foreign Minister, even requested Soviet Union to deploy two squadron of planes along with their pilots after the Suez Crisis. Soviet aid to Syria accelerated and included military and economic agreements. Between 1955 and 1958, Syria received about $294 million from the Soviet Union for military and economic assistance. Simultaneously, the Ba'ath Party in Syria increased its power and influence.A History of the Middle East, Peter Mansfield, Penguin 2010, 3rd edition, p.293 =1966‚Äì2010= Joint Soviet-Syrian space flight July 22‚Äì30, 1987, as part of the Intercosmos project, USSR postage stamp, 1987 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev whilst on a visit to Sochi in August 2008. The Syrian coup d'√©tat of February 1966 gave the Soviet Union the opportunity to further support Syria. A new coup d‚Äô√©tat in 1970, called the Corrective Movement, brought Hafez Assad to power in Syria on 13 November 1970.Historical Background and the Present State of the Russian-Syrian Relations In 1971, under an agreement with President Hafez al-Assad, the Soviet Union was allowed to open its naval military base in Tartus, giving the Soviet Union a stable presence in the Middle East. Thousands of Syrian military officers and educated professionals studied in Russia during al-Assad's presidency (1971‚Äì2000). During the Yom Kippur War, thousands of Soviet advisors and technicians assisted the Syrian army, and 20 are believed to have died. 3750 tonnes of aid was airlifted during the war to Syria. At the end of October 1973, after the war, Soviet Union sealifted 63000 tonnes, mainly to Syria to replace its losses during the war. In April 1977, Hafez al-Assad visited Moscow and met with Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin among others, as a sign of improved Syrian relations with the USSR. In October 1980, Syria and the Soviet Union signed a twenty-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. Throughout 1980s, till the end of Cold War, thousands of Soviet military personnel were present in Syria, and the bulk of Syrian weapons came from USSR and the its allies North Korea, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland. Hafez al-Assad died on 10 June 2000 and was succeeded on 10 July 2000 by his son Bashar al-Assad, who was elected President by referendum in which he ran unopposed, garnering 97.29% of the vote. =Since the Syrian Civil War (2011‚Äìpresent)= Assad and Putin in Damascus, 7 January 2020. During the Syrian Civil War which began in 2011, Russia with China in February 2012 voted against a formal UN Security Council condemnation of the Bashar al-Assad government for alleged attacks on civilians in the city of Homs. In 2018, Russia announced free military education for Syrian kids chosen on merit. The first batch of 8 Syrian kids reached St. Petersburg in August. Military cooperation =Russian naval base in Tartus= The Russian naval facility in Tartus, Syria, was established during the Cold War under a 1971 agreement with Syria. It is Russia's only naval facility in the Mediterranean region and the only remaining military facility outside the former Soviet Union.

Amid Russia's deteriorating relations with the West, because of the 2008 South Ossetia War and plans to deploy a US missile defense shield in Poland, President Assad agreed to the port's conversion into a permanent Middle East base for Russia's nuclear-armed warships. Since 2009, Russia has been renovating the Tartus naval base and dredging the port to allow access for its larger naval vessels. On 18 January 2017, Russia and Syria signed an agreement, effective forthwith, whereunder Russia would be allowed to expand and use the naval facility at Tartus for 49 years on a free-of-charge basis and enjoy sovereign jurisdiction over the base. The treaty allows Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels; it stipulates privileges and full immunity from Syria's jurisdiction for Russia's personnel and materiel at the facility.–°–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π –∏ –°–∏—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ê—Ä–∞–±—Å–∫–æ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –æ —Ä–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –§–ª–æ—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –≤ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–µ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¢–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Å –∏ –∑–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∞—Ö –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ—Ä–∞–±–ª–µ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –≤ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –º–æ—Ä–µ, –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–µ –≤–æ–¥—ã –∏ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—ã –°–∏—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ê—Ä–∞–±—Å–∫–æ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ // ‚Ä≥–°—Ç–∞—Ç—å—è 9 –ò–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—ã –∏ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–∏–ª–µ–≥–∏–∏‚Ä≥, kodeks.ru The treaty was ratified and approved by Russian parliament, and the relevant federal law was signed by president Vladimir Putin by the end of December 2017.–ü–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω –æ —Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–µ–∂–¥—É –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–µ–π –∏ –°–∏—Ä–∏–µ–π –æ —Ä–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –í–ú–§ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –≤ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–µ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞ –¢–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Å kremlin.ru, 29 December 2017.–ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω –æ —Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ –±–∞–∑–µ –í–ú–§ –†–§ –≤ –¢–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Å–µ Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 29 December 2017.Russia‚Äôs upper house ratifies agreement on naval base in Syria‚Äôs Tartus TASS, 26 December 2017. =Russian air base in Palmyra= Russia had in 2013 an airbase in Palmyra (Tadmur). = Russian air base at Latakia= In 2015 Russia established the Khmeimim Air Base at Latakia. =Russian weapons sales= See under section Economic relations ; Arms sales. =Secret Russian spy bases= The journal Jane's Defence Weekly in 2006 assumed two secret, joint, Russian‚ÄìSyrian signals intelligence ‚Äòspy‚Äô posts to exist within Syria. The biggest Russian electronic ‚Äòeavesdropping post‚Äô outside Russian territory was in 2012 established in Latakia. Another signals intelligence base, \\"Center S\\" (\\"–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –°\\" in Cyrillic script), jointly operated by the Russian OSNAZ GRU radio electronic intelligence agency and a Syrian intelligence agency, situated near Al-Harra in Syria close to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, was on 5 October 2014 captured by Free Syrian Army rebels during the Daraa offensive (October 2014). =Syria‚Äôs air defence with Russian equipment= After the 2007 Israeli Operation Orchard airstrikes on an alleged nuclear reactor at al-Kibar in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, and again after the March 2011 Syrian protests, Syria's air defences have been bolstered with Russian upgrades‚Äîwhich the Russians have repeatedly denied. According to Western experts, the Russians delivered Buk-M2 and Pantsir-S1 (also known as SA-22) mobile missile launch and radar systems. While the Syrians were not capable of using such equipment to its full capacity, the Russians also helped man the crews and train the crews. As of late 2012, Syria's air-defence command force comprised thousands of anti-aircraft guns, 130 anti-aircraft missile batteries, and an estimated 50,000 troops, and was qualified by the Guardian as \\"robust\\". =2015 Russian military intervention= On 30 September 2015, Russia began a military intervention in the Syrian Civil War in support of Bashar al-Assad's government, consisting of air strikes against Syrians that oppose the government. In addition, ISIS and Assad's forces fight against opposition groups (FSA). With Vladimir Putin's support, Assad's troops are fighting Free Syrian Army all throughout the country. Expressing Russian, Iranian, and Syrian support for each other, the Chairman of the Iranian parliament's, (aka Islamic Consultative Assembly or Majlis) National Security and Foreign Policy Committee ‚Äî Heshmat-Allah Falahat Pishe ‚Äî stated during an interview on Russia Today TV on February 1, 2019: \\"Russian, Iranian, and Syrian soldiers shed their blood together in Syria. ... I do now know why the Russians hesitate to say that our relationship is strategic. We have fought together and Russia is under American sanctions, just like us. In order to deal with that, we expect more cooperation from the Russian side.\\" In May 2019, The Moscow Times reported that \\"Fifty-five percent of Russian respondents say their country should end its military campaign in Syria, up from 49 percent in August 2017, according to a poll published by Levada\\". Economic relations Russia has significant economic interests in Syria. Its investments in the country were valued at $19.4 billion in 2009, according to The Moscow Times, and its exports to Syria were worth $1.1 billion in 2010. =Arms sales= The Soviet Union‚Äôs military sales to Syria in the 1970s and 80's accounted for 90% of all Syrian military arms imports, according to a United States Congressional Research Service Report released in 2008. The report noted that Syria purchased several billions of dollars' worth of military equipment from the Soviets, including SS-21 \\"Scarab\\" short-range missiles (range 70 km). After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Syria found itself deprived of arms imports, but continued to seek them through former Soviet satellite states. The establishment of the Russian Federation in 1992 saw the re-introduction of the patron-vendor relationship and the cancellation of almost 73% of Syria's debt. According to reports, 2.4% of Russia's total exports come from defense-related sales. From 2000 to 2010, Russia sold around $1.5 billion worth of arms to Syria, making Damascus Moscow's seventh-largest client, according to Dmitri Trenin in the New York Times. In 2008, Syria agreed to purchase modern weapons including modern anti- tank and anti-air missile systems from Russia, including MiG-29SMT fighters, Pantsir S1E air-defense systems, Iskander tactical missile systems, Yak-130 aircraft, and two Amur-1650 submarines. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said his country's sale of weapons to Syria would not upset the balance of power in the Middle East. The sales he stated are \\"in line with the international law\\" and \\"in the interests of strengthening stability and maintaining security\\" in regions close to Russian borders, Lavrov told reporters.‚ÄòRussia defends arms sales to Syria‚Äô. UPI.com, 29 September 2008. During the 2011 Syrian uprising, Russia has allegedly shipped arms to Assad's government for use against rebels. Syria's arms contracts with Russia in 2011 and 2012 amounted to $687 million, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). But according to The Moscow Times, Russia and Syria had in 2011 well over $4 billion in active arms contracts. =Other economic sectors= Russian firms in 2011 had a substantial presence in Syria's infrastructure, energy and tourism industries. Stroitransgaz, a natural gas facility construction company, has the largest Russian operation in Syria. In 2010, it was involved in projects worth $1.1 billion and had a staff of 80 Russians working in Syria. Stroitransgaz is building a natural gas processing plant 200 kilometers east of Homs in the Raqqa region and is involved in technical support for the construction of the Arab Gas Pipeline. Tatneft is the most significant Russian energy firm in Syria. The company began in 2010 through a joint venture with the Syrian national oil company to pump Syrian oil and it planned to spend $12 million on exploratory wells near the Iraqi border. Other firms with large business interests in Syria include steel pipe manufacturer TMK, gas producer ITERA, and national carrier Aeroflot. Presidential trips Dmitry Medvedev and Bashar Al-Assad heading to the Presidential Palace, Damascus on May 10, 2010. Between 27 and 29 April 1987, Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, along with the Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass and Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam, visited the Soviet Union, when he asked to acquire the S-300 missile system, but Mikhail Gorbachev refused to deliver, due to U.S. and Israeli rejection and Syrian accumulated debt from previous arms deals. On 6 July 1999, Assad visited Moscow to finalize an arms deal worth $2 billion. On 10 May 2010, Dmitry Medvedev became the first Russian president to visit Syria. On 11 December 2017, President Vladimir Putin visited the Russian troops at the Khmeimim Air Base. On 7 January 2020, Putin met Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad at the Russian command center in Baramkeh, Damascus during the Orthodox Christmas, where he visited the Umayyad Mosque, Mariamite Cathedral, and the Mausoleum of Saladin.

The elevated plus maze (EPM) is a test measuring anxiety in laboratory animals that usually uses rodents as a screening test for putative anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds and as a general research tool in neurobiological anxiety research such as PTSD and TBI. The model is based on the test animal's aversion to open spaces and tendency to be thigmotaxic. In the EPM, this anxiety is expressed by the animal spending more time in the enclosed arms. Method An elevated plus maze (for mice) The test uses an elevated, plus-shaped (+) apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms. The behavioral model is based on the general aversion of rodents to open spaces. This aversion leads to the behavior termed thigmotaxis, a preference for remaining in enclosed spaces or close to the edges of a bounded space. In the EPM, this translates into the animals limiting their movement to the enclosed arms. Anxiety reduction is indicated in the plus-maze by an increase in the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open arms/total time in open or closed arms) and an increase in the proportion of entries into the open arms (entries into open arms/total entries into open or closed arms). The total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are sometimes used as measures of general activity. The relationship between the EPM and other tests of exploratory activity (open- field and emergence) have been analyzed in two mouse strains. Criticism While EPM is the most commonly employed animal behavioral model of anxiety, there are several issues concerning the validity of the model. Classical clinical anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium), do reduce measures of anxiety in EPM. However, more novel compounds, such as 5-HT1A agonists (e.g., Buspar) give mixed results. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, which are commonly employed in clinical settings to treat anxiety disorders, also do not lead to a stable anxiolytic effect on EPM. This raises the possibility that EPM is a suitable model for testing GABA-related compounds, such as benzodiazepines or direct GABAA agonists, but not for other drugs. Despite this, the model is commonly employed for screening putative anxiolytics and for general research into the brain mechanisms of anxiety, likely due to the ease of employment and the vast number of studies already in the literature.  Variations  = Elevated zero maze = Elevated zero maze (mouse can be seen in the top right) The elevated zero maze (EZM) is an elevated circular runway with alternating open light areas and enclosed dark areas. The continuous nature of this apparatus eliminates the problem of the EPM in how to account for the animal's presence in the center area of the EPM. In the EPM test, animals may spend up to 30% of their time in the ambiguous central start area or return to it often, making it difficult to evaluate the biological significance of anxiety related behaviour. Animal will return to the central area because they are habituated to that area and associate it with being \\"safe\\". Untreated rodents show a higher exploration of open areas in the EZM than in the EPM. This could indicate the EPM inhibits exploration, but the fact that rodents spent time in the central zone of the EPM needs to be taken into account. The EZM is more sensitive to changes than the EPM due to the baseline level in the EZM being lower than the EPM. = Elevated T maze = The elevated T maze (ETM) has three arms in the shape of the letter \\"T\\". One arm is closed and perpendicular to the other two arms which are open. This test is designed to observe anxiety effects and how it affects learning. The rodent is placed on the enclosed arm and allowed to explore. The trial ends when the rodents sets all four paws in on the open arms. Rats are allowed multiple trials until they learn to stay in the open arm for 300 seconds. This is a measurement of inhibitory avoidance. Depending on what the rodents were treated with during the training sessions, they would learn at different rates giving information on how the brain stores memories. This test can be used to assess long term memory. When a rodent has been sufficiently trained, researchers will test the rodent again after a week to observe if the rodent still remembers to stay in the enclosed arm. = Plus-maze discriminative avoidance test = Schematic representation of the apparatus used for the plus-maze discriminative avoidance test. Like the standard EPM, the apparatus used in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance test (PMDAT) has four arms. This test has been used to investigate interactions between aversive memory and anxiety responses in rodents. The apparatus has two open arms opposite to two enclosed arms. In this test, one of the enclosed arms is paired with aversive stimuli (e.g. bright light, loud white noise). During training, animals are placed in the apparatus facing the intercept between the open arms. Each time the animal enters the aversive enclosed arm, the aversive stimulus is presented until the animal leaves the arm. Upon a second exposure to the maze (e.g. 24 h later) the aversive stimuli is no longer presented. Retention of the aversive memory is assessed based on the relative time spent in the non-aversive arm compared to the previously aversive arm and anxiety behavior is calculated based on the time spent in the open arms during the training session. = Multivariate Concentric Square Field test (MCSF-test) = The MCSF-test is a behaviour model used to study risk assessment, risk taking, anxiety and security seeking behaviour. It has a completely different design compared to the t-maze, but instead of using a battery of different behaviour models this test can be used to measure a variety of dependent and independent variables. In this context \\"multivariate\\" is defined as that the subject has a free choice of different environments contained in the same apparatus and session. The MCSF consists of different areas associated with risk-taking and shelter-seeking. The subject can therefore choose between locations with different qualities regarding open areas, illuminations, shelter and exploratory challenges. The arena consists of a dark room enclosed by walls and ceiling, dimly illuminated corridors, open area with moderate illumination, a hole-board area which requires a certain physical effort to reach and an elevated bridge with high illumination. = Elevated plus maze for humans using virtual reality = Using a combination of virtual reality and real-world elements, the EPM has been transferred to usage with humans. Participants who partook in the study were placed on a 3.5 by 3.5 meters wide and 0.3m high wooden cross while wearing a virtual reality headset. In the virtual environment, the real cross was matched in exact dimension and orientation. Open arms were above a 50-meter drop over open water, while the closed arms were surrounded by a stable and firm surface around the platform. Similar to the observed rodent behavior on an EPM, participants reported higher anxiety on open arms while also avoiding those more. Participants with high anxiety also exhibited higher avoidance of open arms.

Spain and the Grand Duchy of Moscow first exchanged envoys in 1520s; regular embassies were established in 1722. Soviet-Spanish relations, once terminated after the Spanish Civil War, were gradually reestablished starting in 1963 and were fully established by 1977. Trade between the two countries amounted to two billion Euros in 2008. In March 2009, the two countries signed an energy agreement providing national energy companies access to other party's domestic markets. Muscovy and Imperial Russia Official contacts between Spain and the Grand Duchy of Moscow go back to 1519, when King Charles I of Spain notified Grand Duke Vasili III of Russia of his ascension to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire as Charles V. In 1523, Yakov Polushkin delivered Vasili's response to the court at Valladolid, thus becoming the first Russian envoy to Spain. In 1525 Russian envoys Ivan Zasekin-Yaroslavsky and Semen Borisov presented their credentials to Charles; they brought news of the Discovery of the Americas to Muscovy. The Spanish Inquisition and especially the aftermath of the Alhambra Decree expelling Jews from the Kingdom were of particular interest to 16th- century Russian clergy, then obsessed with suppressing the Judaizers heresy within the Russian Orthodox Church.Hillgarth, p. 481 Muscovy, unlike contemporary European nations, studied the Inquisition not \\"as an example to avoid but a model to imitate\\". Another temporary contact was established by Pyotr Potemkin's embassy (1667‚Äì1668) during the reign of Alexis I of Russia.Hillgarth, p. 480 Regular embassies of the two countries were established by Peter I of Russia and Philip V of Spain in 1722; in 1723, Russia also opened a consulate in C√°diz. Prince Sergey Golitsyn served as the first Russian ambassador to Spain; duke Diego Francisco de Liria, who also inherited the Jacobite title of Duke of Berwick, served as ambassador of Spain in Russia. However, after the unexpected death of Peter II of Russia, Spain declared the ascension of Anna of Russia unlawful and severed diplomatic relations until 1759. De Liria, who closely watched the events of 1730, provided an important account of Anna's ascension.Anisimov, pp. 80-84 In 1799‚Äì1801 Spain severed ties after Paul I of Russia assumed the Catholic title of Grand Master of Knights Hospitaller; in 1833‚Äì1856 Russia closed the embassies, denying legitimacy of Isabella II of Spain. Apart from these two conflicts, relationships were uneventful; the two countries were never engaged in direct war against each other. In 1756‚Äì1763 they were allies in the Seven Years' War. During the Napoleonic Wars the two countries were both allies and foes, but never engaged each other directly. While Russian intelligentsia commented favorably regarding colonial rebels, Tsar Alexander I (1777-1825) supported the efforts to suppress rebellion by Spain's King Ferdinand VII (1784-1833). Plans for sales of warships were kept secret to avoid British interference. In August 1817, Russia sold Spain five battleships and three frigates. They were delivered to Cadiz in February 1818.Russell H. Bartley, Imperial Russia and the Struggle for Latin American Independence, 1808‚Äì1828 (1978), ch. 3. Russia ignored the independent Latin American states until the late 19th century.William Spence Robertson, \\"Russia and the Emancipation of Spanish America, 1816-1826: Hispanic American Historical Review 21#2 (1941), pp. 196-221 DOI: 10.2307/2507393 online Before the Russian Revolution, Alfonso XIII attempted the exfiltration of the Romanov family from Russia to Spain after the abdication of Nicholas II. Interestingly, the current Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna was born in Madrid on December 23, 1953 and, currently, she lives in the Spanish capital. Soviet period The Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with the Second Spanish Republic on July 28, 1933. Moscow for years tried to purify the Spanish Communist Party by expelling anarchist and Trotskyite members, but the process took years and was finally handled by outside Communists sent to Spain in the Spanish Civil War who exposed and executed opponents.Tim Rees, \\"Deviation and discipline: anti-Trotskyism, Bolshevization and the Spanish Communist party, 1924‚Äì34.\\" Historical Research 82.215 (2009): 131-156. Ambassador Marsel Rosenberg (1896‚Äì1938), and Consul- general Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko (1883‚Äì1938) arrived in Madrid in 1936, when Spanish Civil War was already underway. Both were soon recalled to Moscow and executed for an alleged Trotskist conspiracy. The Soviet Union actively supported the Republicans through the course of the Civil War with military advisers, \\"volunteers\\" and weapons supplied in exchange for Bank of Spain gold reserves later known as Moscow gold (see Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War). The monument to Soviet volunteers in Madrid, inaugurated in 1989 by mayor Juan Barranco Gallardo and Soviet ambassador Sergey Romanovsky, lists 182 names of identified Soviet combatants killed during the war. With the fall of Republicans in 1939, the Soviet Union lost all ties with Spain, now under Franco. During World War II the Blue Division of Spanish volunteers fought against the Soviets on the Eastern Front until Francisco Franco removed them. Franco steered away from direct participation in the war and maintained Spain's neutrality. Spain's relations with the Soviets after World War II were described as \\"the worst, though hardly the most problematic\\",Payne, p. 531 culminating in Nikita Khrushchev's speech against Franco's regime in the United Nations General Assembly on October 1, 1960 and Franco's ban on the Spain vs. USSR game of the 1960 European Nations' Cup scheduled earlier in the same year.Spanish withdrawal from this tournament paved way to Soviets winning the 1960 title. Soon, however, the same leaders began gradual reestablishment of contacts. In April 1963 Khrushchev and Franco exchanged letters on disarmament and the fate of Juli√°n Grimau; in January 1964 Franco appealed to Khrushchev again. According to Soviet explanation of events, the move was initiated by the Spanish government. Until 1969, relations were informally maintained through Soviet and Spanish embassies in France. In 1967 Spanish and Soviet representatives agreed to open their seaports to ships carrying flag of the other country; in 1969 the Soviet state-owned Black Sea Shipping Company opened an office in Madrid ‚Äì the first Soviet establishment in Spain since the Civil War. This office, staffed by professional diplomats, and headed by Sergey Bogomolov, who relocated to Madrid from Paris, doubled as the de facto Soviet consulate. The two countries signed an agreement on foreign trade in 1972. It promoted amicable diplomatic relations and the strategic partnership between the two countries.Yu. Korchagin and A. Rubinchik, \\"Towards a Strategic Partnership: On the 40th Anniversary of the Trade Agreement Between Russia and Spain\\" International Affairs: A Russian Journal of World Politics, Diplomacy & International Relations (2012) 58#6 pp 146-152. They established permanent trading missions in 1973; these offices assumed and maintained consular duties. Igor Ivanov, future foreign minister of independent Russia, has served in Madrid in 1973‚Äì1983.Gladman, p. 586 After Franco's death, the Soviet Union and Spain reestablished full diplomatic relations on February 9, 1977. Bogomolov assumed the title of Soviet ambassador and presented his credentials to king Juan Carlos I of Spain on May 5, 1977. Relations of this period were not exactly friendly, marred with mutual expulsion of alleged spies operating under diplomatic immunity; things got worse when Spain was admitted into NATO in 1981, an act regarded by the USSR as a \\"violation of Soviet interests\\". After Bogomolov moved up to a senior position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1978, he was replaced by Yuri Dubinin, who steered Soviet policy in Spain through the last phase of the Cold War, until 1986. Dubinin actively promoted the idea of a state visit by Juan Carlos to Moscow; only after five years of preparations did Andrei Gromyko approve the visit that materialized in May 1984. Alexander Igorevich Kuznetsov, former (2005 to 2012) Russian ambassador to Spain and Andorra, has served in Madrid under Dubinin in 1982‚Äì1986. The Embassy of Russia in Madrid, inherited from the Soviet Union, was built in 1986‚Äì1991. The land lot at 155, Calle de Velasquez, was provided to the Soviets in 1980, but was loaded with zoning regulations limiting building height to 6 meters, presence of Spanish military cables running underground and a gypsy squat town sprawling above ‚Äì these obstacles held off construction for years. The building was initially designed by painter Ilya Glazunov; Glazunov later contributed interior design, building structure was redesigned by architect Anatoly Polikarpov. Russian Federation Spain and post-Communist Russia established diplomatic relations on December 9, 1991. This resulted in improved economic, trade, and cultural relations. There were museum exhibition exchanges and several visits between the two countries' leaders including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and Spanish King Juan Carlos I. They dealt with the issue of Kosovo's independence from Serbia, Spain's chairmanship of the European Union (EU) in 2010, and foreign energy policy.N. Anikeeva, and Yu.

Juan Carlos visited Russia in 2002, 2006, 2008 and 2012.President of Russia - Meeting with King Juan Carlos I of Spain Spain's share in Russian foreign trade in early 2000s hovered at just above 1% of Russian exports (dominated by oil and raw materials); Spanish exports to Russia were significantly lower (2001: 488 million US dollars vs. 890 million).Gladman, p. 330 In 2008, according to Dmitry Medvedev, foreign trade levelled at 2 billion Euro (less than 1% of either country's foreign trade) while that between Russia and other countries comparable to Spain is measured in tens of billion euro. Spain's share in foreign direct investment to Russian economy remains insignificant, the largest investment (as at 2003), at 319 million US dollars, has been made by Segura Consulting. In December 2000 the relations were strained by Spain' refusal to extradite fugitive banker and media executive Vladimir Gusinsky. Gusinsky, arrested and released in Spain, emigrated to Israel in April 2001.Gladman, p. 307 During the most recent state visit of Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to Spain, in March 2009, two countries signed an energy agreement giving Spanish companies greater access to Russian fossil fuels in exchange to easing Spanish regulations regarding purchase of Spanish energy companies by Russian businesses. According to Spanish prime minister Zapatero, \\"The memorandum means greater security in Spain's energy supplies and it guarantees better access for our companies to Russian energy reserves\\". The memorandum was followed by an agreement between Gazprom and Gas Natural that gives the Spanish side access to Gazprom's export pipelines and, potentially, Shtokman gas field output, in exchange for a stake in Spanish electric utilities. In 2016, the Spanish Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ignacio Ybanez, told NATO officials Spain's support for constructive relations and cooperation between Russia and NATO, so the country defends the continuation of the political dialogue, said the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2019, Spain and Russia regained their cooperation, deteriorated by economic and political tides. Of this, many evidence was recently provided, ranging from the inauguration at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, of an exhibition of works by Pablo Picasso to the agreement to create an alliance between eight public universities in the two countries. Relations deteriorate in the short term when in May the Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell in interview to Spanish newspaper El Periodico de Catalunya called Russia \\"old enemy\\" of Europe. Moscow, believing that he was referring to an unfriendly statement between Spain and Russia, cited the Spanish ambassador to Russia, Fernando Valderrama Pareja, to express the disappointment of Borrell's words. The Spanish minister himself said his statements were misunderstood. Vladimir Putin declared that \\"it is a new nonsense, the alleged threat from Russia to Spain, which is in another part of the European continent\\" and stressed that the Russians love Spain and wish it prosperity and all the best. He also added that \\"as you know, the Soviet Union welcomed thousands of Spanish children, most stayed in our country,\\" he recalled, and \\"I have good relations with King Emeritus Juan Carlos I and now King Felipe VI,\\" Putin stressed. The Spanish monarch, Felipe VI, launching a Europeanist message in the face of the European Parliament elections held in May, defended Russia's \\"key\\" role for economic prosperity. The deputy governor of Moscow Oblast, Vadim Jromov, said, in exclusive statements to The Diplomat, that there are several areas of cooperation between Russia and Spain ‚Äúvery broadly favorable to both‚Äù and \\"we consider that the business world has nothing to do with sanctions and we will continue to support friendly relations between Spain and Russia, which are already hundreds of years old and are not going to be changed by particular decisions taken at any given time‚Äù. The Minister Counselor of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Spain, Dmitry Sokolov, classified the relations between Spain and Russia as excellent and declared that ‚Äúwe don't mess with the internal politics of Spain. The differences and internal disputes of any country must be resolved based on the Constitution, laws and dialogue between the political forces‚Äù. Both countries celebrated 300 years of diplomatic and cultural relations that led to the inauguration of permanent embassies in 1723, recalling that \\"500 years ago the first official contacts between the Spanish court and the Muscovite Duchy took place.\\" In 2020, the representative of Russian diplomacy said in the margins of the 11th edition of the Gaidar Forum to ignore whether contacts have already been established between Moscow and the new Spanish Government, and assured that Russia is interested in \\"deepening the traditional friendly relations and of association \\"with Spain. \\"We believe that there is no reason for our nations to be guided by the politics of others and we trust that Russian-Spanish relations, with the current Government - or with any other - have a good future,\\" he said. The Russian ambassador in Madrid, Yuri Korchagin, assured Efe that relations between Spain and Russia have been \\"excellent\\" with both the PP government and now with the socialist. \\"Never, with democratic governments in Spain, have we had any problems or any impasse. There is always an interest in moving forward, promoting our relationship and friendship. Relations between Russia and Spain are friendly,\\" he said.

History In its heyday, from the late 1800s to the early 1940s, the area was home to many of Boston's newspapers. As Boston Globe historian Thomas F. Mulvoy Jr. explains, \\"In the pre-radio era, newspapers along the Row, which began at Milk Street and wound its way down to the Old State House about 200 yards away, spread the news not only in their broadsheet pages but also on blackboards and bulletin boards outside their offices that would lure large crowds anxious to get the very latest telegraphic news flashes on big events like elections, John L. Sullivan's latest fight, and the World Series.\\"(Mulvoy, CW2) In its first incarnation, Newspaper Row was located between State and Water Streets, in the financial district. But gradually, as the city expanded and more department stores and other businesses opened in the vicinity of Washington Street, the major newspapers moved closer to the center of commerce. By the early 1900s, according to the Boston City Directory, the Boston Globe was at 244 Washington Street, the Boston Evening Transcript was at 324 Washington (at Milk Street), the Boston Post was at 261 Washington Street, the Boston Journal was at 264 Washington Street, the Boston American was at 80-82 Summer Street, and the Associated Press was at 293 Washington Street. Other Boston news services, including the Boston Herald and Boston Traveler, were not far from Newspaper Row. It was a noisy, crowded, narrow part of downtown Boston, but those who worked there did not seem to mind. As Herbert Kenny, a long-time Boston Globe reporter, wrote, \\"Newspaper Row... was unique. Mingling at Thompson's Spa [a popular nearby restaurant ] were politicians from the State House and City Hall, judges and lawyers from the courthouse, and Yankees from the financial district, along with cops, bookies, bootleggers and reporters, all swapping ideas, compliments, insults and inside information...\\"(quoted by Thomas, 23) Newspaper Row became a gathering place for the public too, especially during major events like presidential elections, the World Series or the Harvard-Yale football game. Thousands would pack the narrow streets to hear the latest reports. Newspapers would receive bulletins by telegraph and then a staff- member either posted them on a blackboard, or announced the news to the crowd, by means of a megaphone.(\\"Greatest Crowd,\\" 15; \\"Frenzied Yell,\\" 5) There was intense competition between the newspapers to see who could get the headlines first.(\\"Post Led All, 8\\"; \\"First News,\\" 24). Newspaper Row was also utilized for promotions, publicity stunts, and advocacy; large numbers of people stopped by to read the headlines or listen to updates, and proponents of various causes would try to get their attention. A good example occurred in 1909, when supporters of giving women the vote sold copies of their pro- suffrage newspaper and engaged people in conversation about suffrage.(\\"Suffragette Newsies,\\" 10) Another example occurred in 1914, when the Boston Post raised enough funds to purchase three new elephants for the Franklin Park Zoo; the newspaper then held a parade on Newspaper Row and thousands of school children got the chance to meet the elephants.(Kenny, 1987) As the years passed, people became able to receive news and bulletins from radio, and no longer needed to wait on Washington Street for the latest headlines. Gradually, the crowds on Newspaper Row diminished. Newspapers either closed down or moved to larger quarters. The last newspaper to abandon Newspaper Row was the Boston Globe, in May 1958 (\\"The Press\\", np). Newspaper Row was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. And in 2003, the Bostonian Society placed a historical marker at the former home of the Boston Globe, 244 Washington Street.(Kingsley, B2) Image gallery Image:Newspaper Row ca 1906.jpgNewspaper Row in ca. 1906, showing the locations of the Boston Post (left), the Boston Globe (center-left) and the Boston Journal (center-right) Image:1896 Newspaper Row Boston map byStadly BPL 12479 detail.pngMap of Washington Street, showing several of the newspaper companies along Newspaper Row, 1896 Image:Boston Evening Transcript Building.jpgThe former building of the Boston Evening Transcript, in 2014 Image:Boston Journal Building.jpgThe former building of the Boston Journal, in 2014  See also  * Pie Alley (Boston) * National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Boston, Massachusetts References Sources *\\"First News from the Globe.\\" Boston Globe, November 25, 1900, p. 24\\\\. *\\"Frenzied Yell At End of Game.\\" Boston Globe, October 17, 1912, p. 5\\\\. *\\"Greatest Crowd in Newspaper Row History Follows Globe Bulletins.\\" Boston Globe, October 10, 1915, p. 15\\\\. *Kenny, Herbert A.

If in state c, it exhibits the same behavior for every input string as in state d, or in state e. Similarly, states a and b are nondistinguishable. The DFA has no unreachable states. Equivalent minimal DFA. Nondistinguishable states have been joined into a single one. In automata theory (a branch of theoretical computer science), DFA minimization is the task of transforming a given deterministic finite automaton (DFA) into an equivalent DFA that has a minimum number of states. Here, two DFAs are called equivalent if they recognize the same regular language. Several different algorithms accomplishing this task are known and described in standard textbooks on automata theory., Section 4.4.3, \\"Minimization of DFA's\\". Minimum DFA For each regular language, there also exists a minimal automaton that accepts it, that is, a DFA with a minimum number of states and this DFA is unique (except that states can be given different names)., Section 3.4, Theorem 3.10, p.67, Section 4.4.3, \\"Minimization of DFA's\\", p. 159, and p. 164 (remark after Theorem 4.26) The minimal DFA ensures minimal computational cost for tasks such as pattern matching. There are two classes of states that can be removed or merged from the original DFA without affecting the language it accepts to minimize it. * Unreachable states are the states that are not reachable from the initial state of the DFA, for any input string. * Nondistinguishable states are those that cannot be distinguished from one another for any input string. DFA minimization is usually done in three steps, corresponding to the removal or merger of the relevant states. Since the elimination of nondistinguishable states is computationally the most expensive one, it is usually done as the last step. Unreachable states The state p of a deterministic finite automaton M=(Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q0, F) is unreachable if no string w in Œ£* exists for which p=Œ¥*(q0, w). In this definition, Q is the set of states, Œ£ is the set of input symbols, Œ¥ is the transition function (mapping a state and an input symbol to a set of states), Œ¥*is its extension to strings, q0 is the initial state, and F is the set of accepting (aka final) states. Reachable states can be obtained with the following algorithm: let reachable_states := {q0}; let new_states := {q0}; do { temp := the empty set; for each q in new_states do for each c in Œ£ do temp := temp ‚à™ {p such that p = Œ¥(q,c)}; end; end; new_states := temp \\\\ reachable_states; reachable_states := reachable_states ‚à™ new_states; } while (new_states ‚â† the empty set); unreachable_states := Q \\\\ reachable_states; Unreachable states can be removed from the DFA without affecting the language that it accepts. Nondistinguishable states =Hopcroft's algorithm= One algorithm for merging the nondistinguishable states of a DFA, due to , is based on partition refinement, partitioning the DFA states into groups by their behavior. These groups represent equivalence classes of the Myhill‚ÄìNerode equivalence relation, whereby every two states of the same partition are equivalent if they have the same behavior for all the input sequences. That is, for every two states and that belong to the same equivalence class within the partition , and every input word , the transitions determined by should always take states and to equal states, states that both accept, or states that both reject. It should not be possible for to take to an accepting state and to a rejecting state or vice versa. The following pseudocode describes the algorithm: P := {F, Q \\\\ F}; W := {F, Q \\\\ F}; while (W is not empty) do choose and remove a set A from W for each c in Œ£ do let X be the set of states for which a transition on c leads to a state in A for each set Y in P for which X ‚à© Y is nonempty and Y \\\\ X is nonempty do replace Y in P by the two sets X ‚à© Y and Y \\\\ X if Y is in W replace Y in W by the same two sets else if X ‚à© Y <= Y \\\\ X add X ‚à© Y to W else add Y \\\\ X to W end; end; end; The algorithm starts with a partition that is too coarse: every pair of states that are equivalent according to the Myhill‚ÄìNerode relation belong to the same set in the partition, but pairs that are inequivalent might also belong to the same set. It gradually refines the partition into a larger number of smaller sets, at each step splitting sets of states into pairs of subsets that are necessarily inequivalent. The initial partition is a separation of the states into two subsets of states that clearly do not have the same behavior as each other: the accepting states and the rejecting states. The algorithm then repeatedly chooses a set from the current partition and an input symbol , and splits each of the sets of the partition into two (possibly empty) subsets: the subset of states that lead to on input symbol , and the subset of states that do not lead to . Since is already known to have different behavior than the other sets of the partition, the subsets that lead to also have different behavior than the subsets that do not lead to . When no more splits of this type can be found, the algorithm terminates. Lemma. Given a fixed character c and an equivalence class Y that splits into equivalence classes B and C, only one of B or C is necessary to refine the whole partition.Based on Corollary 10 of Example: Suppose we have an equivalence class Y that splits into equivalence classes B and C. Suppose we also have classes D, E, and F; D and E have states with transitions into B on character c, while F has transitions into C on character c. By the Lemma, we can choose either B or C as the distinguisher, let's say B. Then the states of D and E are split by their transitions into B. But F, which doesn't point into B, simply doesn't split during the current iteration of the algorithm; it will be refined by other distinguisher(s). Observation. All of B or C is necessary to split referring classes like D, E, and F correctly-- subsets won't do. The purpose of the outermost \`if\` statement (\`if Y is in W\`) is to patch up W, the set of distinguishers. We see in the previous statement in the algorithm that Y has just been split. If Y is in W, it has just become obsolete as a means to split classes in future iterations. So Y must be replaced by both splits because of the Observation above. If Y is not in W, however, only one of the two splits, not both, needs to be added to W because of the Lemma above. Choosing the smaller of the two splits guarantees that the new addition to W is no more than half the size of Y; this is the core of the Hopcroft algorithm: how it gets its speed, as explained in the next paragraph. The worst case running time of this algorithm is , where is the number of states and is the size of the alphabet. This bound follows from the fact that, for each of the transitions of the automaton, the sets drawn from that contain the target state of the transition have sizes that decrease relative to each other by a factor of two or more, so each transition participates in of the splitting steps in the algorithm. The partition refinement data structure allows each splitting step to be performed in time proportional to the number of transitions that participate in it.; This remains the most efficient algorithm known for solving the problem, and for certain distributions of inputs its average-case complexity is even better, .. Once Hopcroft's algorithm has been used to group the states of the input DFA into equivalence classes, the minimum DFA can be constructed by forming one state for each equivalence class. If is a set of states in , is a state in , and is an input character, then the transition in the minimum DFA from the state for , on input , goes to the set containing the state that the input automaton would go to from state on input . The initial state of the minimum DFA is the one containing the initial state of the input DFA, and the accepting states of the minimum DFA are the ones whose members are accepting states of the input DFA. =Moore's algorithm= Moore's algorithm for DFA minimization is due to . Like Hopcroft's algorithm, it maintains a partition that starts off separating the accepting from the rejecting states, and repeatedly refines the partition until no more refinements can be made. At each step, it replaces the current partition with the coarsest common refinement of partitions, one of which is the current one and the others are the preimages of the current partition under the transition functions for each of the input symbols. The algorithm terminates when this replacement does not change the current partition. Its worst-case time complexity is : each step of the algorithm may be performed in time using a variant of radix sort to reorder the states so that states in the same set of the new partition are consecutive in the ordering, and there are at most steps since each one but the last increases the number of sets in the partition. The instances of the DFA minimization problem that cause the worst- case behavior are the same as for Hopcroft's algorithm. The number of steps that the algorithm performs can be much smaller than , so on average (for constant ) its performance is or even depending on the random distribution on automata chosen to model the algorithm's average-case behavior. =Brzozowski's algorithm= As observed, reversing the edges of a DFA produces a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) for the reversal of the original language, and converting this NFA to a DFA using the standard powerset construction (constructing only the reachable states of the converted DFA) leads to a minimal DFA for the same reversed language. Repeating this reversal operation a second time produces a minimal DFA for the original language. The worst-case complexity of Brzozowski's algorithm is exponential, as there are regular languages for which the minimal DFA of the reversal is exponentially larger than the minimal DFA of the language,For instance, the language of binary strings whose th symbol is a one requires only states, but its reversal requires states. provides a ternary -state DFA whose reversal requires states, the maximum possible. For additional examples and the observation of the connection between these examples and the worst-case analysis of Brzozowski's algorithm, see . but it frequently performs better than this worst case would suggest. NFA minimization While the above procedures work for DFAs, the method of partitioning does not work for non- deterministic finite automata (NFAs)., Section 4.4, Figure labeled \\"Minimizing the States of an NFA\\", p. 163. While an exhaustive search may minimize an NFA, there is no polynomial-time algorithm to minimize general NFAs unless P=PSPACE, an unsolved conjecture in computational complexity theory which is widely believed to be false. However, there are methods of NFA minimization that may be more efficient than brute force search. See also * State encoding for low power Notes References *. * *. *. *. *.

History Embassy of Sweden in Moscow Embassy of Russia in Stockholm Historically the two countries have been connected since ancient days, when Swedish Vikings traded on the big Russian rivers and started settlements that later became large cities such as Novgorod and Kyiv. These settlements gave rise to mutual bonds that were also dynastical, as a Swedish king (Rurik) started a dynasty that came to rule uninterruptedly from the 8th to 16th century as depicted in the Nestors chronicle. Even the name Russia is said to emanate from Sweden as the old name for Swedish Vikings from the east were Ros. =Wars= During the middle age several wars were fought between the Swedes and Russians, and eleven wars have been fought between Russia and Sweden since the 12th century. The central theme of the 1600‚Äì1725 era was the struggle between Sweden and Russia for control of the Baltic, as well as territories around it. Russia was ultimately the winner, and Sweden lost its status as a major power.Jill Lisk, The struggle for supremacy in the Baltic, 1600‚Äì1725 (1968). In 1610 the Swedish army marched into Moscow under the command of Jakob De la Gardie. From 1623 to 1709, Swedish policy, particularly under Gustavus Adolphus (1611‚Äì32) and Charles XII (1697‚Äì1718), encouraged and militarily supported Ukrainian opposition to Muscovite Russian hegemony. Gustavus Adolphus fought the Ingrian War against Russia. It ended in 1617 with the Treaty of Stolbovo, which excluded Russia from the Baltic Sea. Sweden's most dramatic defeat on the battleground came in 1709 at the battle of Poltava, in an attempt to second the Ukrainian rebellion leader Mazepa.Gary Dean Peterson, Warrior kings of Sweden: the rise of an empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (McFarland, 2007). In these wars superior Russian forces often outnumbered Swedes, which however often stood their ground in battles such as those of Narva (1700) and Svensksund (1790) due to Sweden's capable military organisation. Great Northern War In 1700, a triple alliance of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, Saxony‚ÄìPoland‚ÄìLithuania and Russia launched a threefold attack on the Swedish protectorate of Swedish Holstein-Gottorp and provinces of Livonia and Ingria, aiming to draw advantage as Sweden was unaligned and ruled by a young and inexperienced king, thus initiating the Great Northern War. Leading the Swedish army against the alliance Charles won multiple victories despite being usually significantly outnumbered. A major victory over a Russian army some three times the size in 1700 at the Battle of Narva compelled Peter the Great to sue for peace which Charles then rejected. In 1706 Swedish forces under general Carl Gustav Rehnski√∂ld defeated over a combined army of Saxony and Russia at the Battle of Fraustadt. Russia was now the sole remaining hostile power.R.M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden (1968). Charles' subsequent march on Moscow met with initial success as victory followed victory, the most significant of which was the Battle of Holowczyn where the smaller Swedish army routed a Russian army twice the size. The campaign ended with disaster when the Swedish army suffered heavy losses to a Russian force more than twice its size at Poltava, Charles had been incapacitated by a wound prior to the battle rendering him unable to take command. The defeat was followed by Surrender at Perevolochna. Charles spent the following years in exile in the Ottoman Empire before returning to lead an assault on Norway, trying to evict the Danish king from the war once more in order to aim all his forces at the Russians. Two campaigns met with frustration and ultimate failure, concluding with his death at the Siege of Fredriksten in 1718.F.G. Bengtsson, The Life of Charles XII, King of Sweden, 1697‚Äì1718 (1960). At the time, most of the Swedish Empire was under foreign military occupation, though Sweden itself was still free. This situation was later formalized, albeit moderated in the subsequent Treaty of Nystad. The close saw not only the end of the Swedish Empire but also of its powerful monarchy and war machine.R. Nisbet Bain, Charles XII and the Collapse of the Swedish Empire, 1682‚Äì1719 (1899) online. In the Great Northern War, Swedish prisoners of war were sent in considerable numbers to Siberia, where they numbered perhaps 25% of the population of Tobolsk, the capital of Siberia, and some settled permanently. St Petersburg, which is located at the same place as the originally Swedish city Nyen in the province Ingermanland, was also built to a great extent by Swedish prisoners of war. Estonia was under Swedish rule from 1558 to 1710; the territory was later ceded to Russia in 1721. All Estonian-Swedes from the island of Hiiumaa were forced to move to New Russia (present day Ukraine) by Catherine II of Russia, where they formed their very own village Gammalsvenskby. Napoleonic wars In the middle of the Napoleonic wars, 1803‚Äì1815, Tsar Alexander of Russia started a war against Sweden. The area included modern Sweden and Finland. Sweden relied on what it called 'The Gibraltar of the North'--the new fortifications at Sveaborg near modern-day Helsinki. It was prepared for heavy attacks and long sieges. Nevertheless, it surrendered to the Russians in a matter of weeks and 1808, due to the forceful demands of Russian General Jan Pieter van Suchtelen and the pusillanimous responses of Swedish Vice-Admiral Carl Olof Cronstedt. After the war ended in 1809, Finland was handed over to Russia. Napoleon's invasion of Swedish Pomerania in January 1812 led to a rapprochement between Sweden and Russia that included Russian recognition of Swedish rule over Norway. There never was another war between the two and Sweden lost its role as a major regional power. Carl Nordling, \\"Capturing 'The Gibraltar of the North:‚Äô How Swedish Sveaborg was taken by the Russians in 1808.\\" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 17.4 (2004): 715‚Äì725. 20th and 21st centuries The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg between July and December 1944 issued protective passports and housed Jews, saving tens of thousands of Jewish lives in Hungary. In 1944 he was arrested in Hungary and imprisoned in Moscow where he is supposed to have died. This occurred in the days of the Soviet Union, but the issue has later even been discussed between Russia and Sweden. On 27 October 1981, U-137, a Soviet submarine of whiskey class (according to NATO terminology) ran aground on Swedish territorial waters near Karlskrona. Early morning on the day after local fishermen spotted the submarine standing on the rocks in the Blekinge archipelago, an episode commonly labelled \\"Whiskey on the rocks\\". At this occasion Swedish naval forces took stand along the naval borders of Sweden and it was later revealed that the Swedish Premier Torbj√∂rn F√§lldin had issued order to shoot to the navy, should approaching Soviet navy cross the Swedish sea border. Swedish defence research also confirmed there could be nuclear weapons aboard the submarine. Over the years, there have been many submarine incidents where the Soviet Union has tried to collect military information from Sweden, including sightings of Soviet submarines along the Swedish coastline and espionage affairs. Relations between the two nations worsened after Moscow had rejected plans for a major EU-Russia summit in Stockholm. Then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev believed that the summit should take place in Brussels because he believed it was a more neutral place for the summit. Another source of tension in the Russo-Swedish relations is Russia's recognition of the two breakaway regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which broke away from Georgia after the 2008 war in South Ossetia. Sweden's then-foreign minister Carl Bildt condemned Russia's actions, and compared it to that of Adolf Hitler's pre-Second World War aggression. Swedish politician Jan Bj√∂rklund has also suggested that military units should be put on Gotland in case of a war between Russia and Sweden. The Nord Stream gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany was the topic of Swedish Defence Research Agency's Robert L. Larsson's 110-page study \\"Nord Stream, Sweden and Baltic Sea Security\\" (2007) that found a number of concerning aspects in the Nord Stream project. The Swedish Defence Commission, however, did not mention any military implications of the pipeline in its December 2007 report on security issues and instead called for strict environmental requirements and cooperation between Baltic Sea states on surveillance. The Swedish government gave its approval of the project in November 2009. Russian bombers have operated close to Swedish airspace on a number of occasions after the Ukrainian crisis and this has caused a discussion in Sweden to scale up its defences which also happened in 2015 with acquisitions of more Gripen aircraft, submarines, anti aircraft missiles and deployment of troops to Gotland in the Baltic Sea. In March 2018, relations deteriorated further due to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, United Kingdom. Upon the United Kingdom stating that Russia produced the agent used, Russia claimed that several countries including Sweden were producing Novichok, the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack.https://www.rt.com/news/421591-uk- produce-novichok-agent/ The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Margot Wallstr√∂m, called the accusations 'unacceptable' on Twitter.https://twitter.com/margotwallstrom/status/975044507409567745 In response to the attack, Sweden expelled a Russian diplomat from Stockholm.https://www.thelocal.se/20180326/breaking-sweden-expels-russian- diplomat-over-skripal-attack In response, Russia expelled a Swedish diplomat from Moscow.https://www.thelocal.se/20180330/russia-to-expel-swedish-diplomat- over-spy-poisoning See also * Finland‚ÄìRussia relations * Russo-Swedish Wars * Russians in Sweden * Russian National Association * Anti-Russian sentiment in Sweden * Swedish School in Moscow References Further reading * Birgeg√•rd, Ulla; Sandomirskaia, Irina.

It is native to western North America, where it grows in many habitat types. There are a great number of wild varieties of this species, and they vary in appearance. The flower and the fruit of a given individual are generally needed to identify it down to the variety. Distribution As a species, Astragalus lentiginosus is distributed throughout the Great Basin of North America, west from the Rocky Mountains to the California Coast Ranges, south to Mexico, and north to British Columbia. The varieties are largely limited to marginal habitats such as disturbed sites in the arid regions of the continent. The group also contains a number of edaphic specialists which occur at desert seeps, which frequently exhibit high levels of calcium carbonate. Description Astragalus lentiginosus is a perennial or occasionally annual herb with leaves up to long divided into many pairs of small leaflets. The plant is prostrate to erect in form and quite woolly to nearly hairless. The inflorescence holds up to 50 pea-like flowers which may be purplish or whitish or a mix of both. A unifying character among most of the varieties is an inflated, beaked legume pod with a groove along the side. The pod dries to a papery texture and dehisces starting at the beak to release the seeds. The epithet lentiginosus refers to the red mottling commonly found on the pods which resemble freckles. Taxonomy Many of what we currently know as varieties of Astragalus lentiginosus were originally described as individual species. Botanist Marcus E. Jones was the first to recognize the similarities among these taxa and arranged them as varieties of one species. Per Axel Rydberg employed a very different species concept stating that he did not believe in infrataxa This resulted in his raising Jones's varieties to species in the genera Cystium and Tium. A notable novelty of Rydberg's treatment is the concept of sections which have been maintained in the keys of subsequent treatments, even if this was not explicitly stated. Subsequent treatments include Barneby, Isely, and Welsh. Each of these treatments are slightly different, containing between 36 and 42 taxa. Recent molecular work seems to suggest a genetic component to the varieties. =Varieties= A. l. var. coachellae Currently the following 40 taxa are recognized: *A. l. var. albifolius M.E.Jones 1923. *A. l. var. ambiguus Barneby 1964. *A. l. var. antonius Barneby 1945. *A. l. var. araneosus (E.Sheld.)

Various rabbinical authorities have pronounced on what is permitted and what is not, but there are many disagreements in detailed interpretation, both between different individual authorities and between branches of Judaism. In Orthodox Judaism, it is agreed that electrical devices may not be used on Shabbat, but Orthodox authorities of Jewish law have disagreed about the basis of this prohibition since the early 20th century. Many Orthodox leaders have held that turning on an incandescent light bulb violates the Biblical prohibition against igniting a fire. However, the reasons for prohibiting the operation of an electrical appliance that does not involve heating metal to glowing temperatures (which is considered like kindling a fire because of the heat and light), are not agreed upon. At least six substantive reasons have been suggested, and a minority (including Rav Shlomo Zalman AuerbachBroyde and Jachter, part II, section G.) believe that turning on most electrical appliances is prohibited only because of common Jewish practice and tradition (minhag) and to maintain the spirit of Shabbat, but not for any substantive technical halachik reason. Some Conservative authorities, on the other hand, reject the argument that turning on incandescent lights is considered \\"igniting\\".Neulander, Arthur. \\"The Use of Electricity on the Sabbath.\\" Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly 14 (1950) 165‚Äì171.Adler, Morris; Agus, Jacob; and Friedman, Theodore. \\"Responsum on the Sabbath.\\" Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly 14 (1950), 112‚Äì137.Klein, Isaac. A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice. The Jewish Theological Seminary of America: New York, 1979. The Conservative movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has argued that \\"refraining from operating lights and other permitted electrical appliances is a pious behavior,\\" but is not required, while also stating that the use of some electrical devices (such as computers, cameras, and smartphones which record data) is forbidden on the sabbath.Daniel Nevins, The Use of Electrical and Electronic Devices on Shabbat Although directly operating electrical appliances is prohibited in Orthodoxy, several indirect methods are permitted according to some authorities. For example, Jews may set a timer before Shabbat to operate a light or appliance on Shabbat, and in some cases, they may adjust the timer on Shabbat. Actions that activate an electrical appliance but are not specifically intended to do so may be permitted if the activation is not certain to occur or if the person does not benefit from the appliance's automatic operation. For example, most authorities allow Jews to open a refrigerator door even though it may cause the motor to turn on immediately or later (not certain to occur); however, they prohibit opening the door if a light inside will automatically turn on (certain and of benefit). Some rabbinic authorities permit, under certain conditions, walking past a house with a motion sensor which switches on a light (for example, if the street is already well-lit so there would not be any direct benefit for you). Some uses of electricity are especially controversial in Israel because of its majority Jewish population. The use of automated machines to milk cows on Shabbat, an activity that is prohibited if done by hand, is disputed because the farmer may derive economic benefit from the milk, although cows suffer if not milked regularly. The use of electricity from power plants operated by Jews in violation of Shabbat is also controversial because it is normally forbidden to benefit from the action of another Jew's violation of Shabbat. However, because of communal need and other halakhic factors, most religious authorities in Israel permit these uses of electricity. Incidental prohibitions and leniencies Many electric devices may not be used on Shabbat for reasons unrelated to electricity. For example: * An electric stove may not be used to cook food, since all cooking of food is forbidden (). * An electric lawn mower may not be used, since cutting grass by any means is forbidden (). * Use of a computer may violate the prohibition of writing (), either in displaying words on the screen, or saving information to the disk (see fuller discussion below). Conversely, even if use of an electric device would normally be forbidden on Shabbat, in certain circumstances it may be permitted due to leniencies which apply to all Shabbat prohibitions. For example: * If violating Shabbat is the only way of saving a human life (), one may (and must) violate Shabbat in order to save a life. * If one performs an activity which indirectly causes Shabbat to be violated (), the level of violation is considered lower. If other reasons for leniency are present, the activity may become permitted under certain conditions. * If one performs an activity which has the unwanted consequence of violating Shabbat (), the level of violation is considered lower. If other reasons for leniency are present, the activity may become permitted. * If one performs an activity which has the unwanted consequence of possibly (not definitely) violating Shabbat (), the activity is permitted on Shabbat. Incandescent lights Of the 39 categories of creative activities prohibited on Shabbat, rabbinic authorities have associated at least three with incandescent lights. The overwhelming majority of Orthodox halakhic authorities maintain that turning on an incandescent light on Shabbat violates a Biblical prohibition on \\"igniting\\" a fire (Hebrew: ◊î◊ë◊¢◊®◊î, ), because the filament becomes glowing hot like a coal.Rabbi Michael Broyde & Rabbi Howard Jachter, The Use of Electricity on Shabbat and Yom Tov, part 1, section A. Journal of Halacha & Contemporary Society No. XXI - Spring 1991 - Pesach 5751. Some argue instead that it violates the prohibition on \\"cooking\\". Another approach is that of Raavad, who would classify incandescent light as a third creative activity: \\"completing a product\\" (Hebrew: ◊û◊õ◊î ◊ë◊§◊ò◊ô◊©, : literally, \\"striking the final hammer blow\\").Comments to Mishneh Torah, Laws of Shabbat 12:1 The Mishnah, in the context of laws prohibiting cooking, states: \\"One who heats a metal pot may not pour cold water into it to heat [the water], but he may pour water into the pot or a cup in order to quench [the vessel].\\"Shabbat 41a. In the Gemara, Rav says it is permitted to add water to cool it, but forbidden to add water to mold the metal. Shmuel says it is also permitted to add enough water to mold the metal as long as that is not his intent, but if he intends to mold the metal it is forbidden.Shabbat 41b In a different context, Rav Sheshet says that \\"cooking\\" a metal filament is forbidden by analogy to cooking spices.Yevamot 6b Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach prohibits raising (or lowering) the level of an electric heater with an adjustable dial, since numerous small heating elements are turned on (or off) in the process.Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Minchat Shlomo p. 111 Conservative Rabbi Daniel Nevins has argued that, according to traditional halakhic sources, heating a filament is not prohibited, because the heat does not cause any significant change in the metal and provides no benefit. =Fluorescent and LED lights= While the visible light produced by fluorescent lamps comes from a phosphor coating which luminesces at low temperature, such lamps also include metal electrodes which are heated to a very high temperature, seemingly causing the same halachic issues as incandescent lamps. However, LED lamps contain no hot metal filament and do not have the same halachic questions, though they may be halachically problematic for reasons discussed later in this article. Shabbat laws potentially related to electricity Other prohibitions may apply to electric devices that do not involve heating metal to glowing temperatures. =Molid= The Talmud prohibits infusing a fragrant scent into one's clothing on Shabbat.Beitzah 23a According to Rashi, this is because a rabbinic prohibition exists to \\"create anything new\\" (molid).Rashi to Beitzah 23a Rabbi Yitzchak Schmelkes suggested applying molid to the generating of electric current.Beit Yitzchak, Yoreh Deah 2:31 Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and many others disagree with this application. Among other reasons, they state that molid is a limited category that cannot be expanded past the definitions the Talmudic Sages imposed.Broyde and Jachter, part II, section A. Rav Auerbach also stated that molid only applies when the new property is visible (which is not the case with an electric current in a circuit, but is the case when a computer screen is lit up, for example). Nevins has endorsed Rav Auerbach's reasoning. In any case, molid would seemingly apply only creating an electric circuit, not to extinguishing an existing current (or modifying its strength). =Boneh= The Chazon Ish wrote that closing an electrical circuit to create an electrical current is Biblically prohibited as \\"building\\" (boneh), and opening a closed circuit is prohibited as \\"destroying\\".Chazon Ish, Orach Chaim 50:9 R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach disagreed vigorously with the Chazon Ish. Among other reasons, he claimed that building and destroying must be fundamentally permanent in nature, whereas most electrical devices are routinely turned on and off at will, and the person who turns it on usually intends that it will be turned off at some later point, and vice versa. Building an item that is fundamentally temporary in nature is at most a Rabbinic prohibition, and Rav Auerbach said that opening and closing a circuit is like opening and closing a door, which is not prohibited at all.Broyde and Jachter, part II, section B Many other Orthodox authorities take this position as well, as does the Conservative Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. One contemporary authority states that even according to the Chazon Ish, the prohibition of \\"building\\" would not apply to changing the state of electric circuits in a computer which is already running. =Makeh Bapatish= The Chazon Ish argued, in addition, that closing a circuit to render a device operational might violate the Biblical prohibition of (striking the final hammer blow, i.e.. completing a product).Chazon Ish, Orach Chain, 50:9 The argument would be that an electrical device is not complete because it does not function unless the electricity is turned on. Rabbis Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Yaakov Breisch, and Nevins strongly disagree because refers to a fundamentally permanent act that requires great effort, and turning on an electrical appliance is fundamentally temporary because it will be turned off, and requires a minimal amount of effort.Broyde and Jachter, part II, section C. Rabbi Osher Weiss argues that intentionally creating an electric circuit violates because (in his opinion) any activity that is sufficiently significant and creative is prohibited on Shabbat, and if it does not fit into one of the 38 other forbidden activities, it is categorized as . He also argues that unintentionally creating a circuit (as often occurs when electronic devices operate in a person's vicinity) is completely permitted, as it does not have the level of significance needed to qualify as .Rav Asher Weiss‚Äô New Perspective on the Use of Electricity on Shabbat ‚Äì Part Two by Rabbi Chaim Jachter =Sparks= Intentionally creating burning sparks, for example by rubbing stones together to make a fire, is prohibited on Shabbat as igniting a fire; it is possible that this prohibition includes the sparks momentarily generated when an electric appliance is turned on.Mavir (8) - Yetzirat Nitzotzot Hashmal Stati VeOd However, R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach rules leniently for several reasons: the lighting of sparks is undesired, and might not occur, and the sparks are very small so they might not be considered significant. With solid-state technology, the probability of generating sparks is greatly reduced.Broyde and Jachter, part II, section D. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman recounts that he was approached by young rabbis in a seminary who asked him \\"is electricity fire?\\". He replied, \\"no\\", but asked why they wanted to know, and was shocked that they weren't interested in science at all, but just wanted to interpret the Talmud. Feynman said that electricity was not a chemical process, as fire is, and pointed out that there is electricity in atoms and thus every phenomenon that occurs in the world. Feynman proposed a simple way to eliminate the spark: '\\"If that's what's bothering you, you can put a condenser across the switch, so the electricity will go on and off without any spark whatsoever‚Äîanywhere.' But for some reason, they didn't like that idea either\\".Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character, chapter Is electricity fire?, Richard Feynman, Ralph Leighton (contributor), Edward Hutchings (editor), 1985, W W Norton, , 1997 paperback: =Additional fuel consumption= Turning on an appliance may indirectly cause the power plant to consume more fuel, and as so violates mavir, the augmenting of a fire.https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/electricity-on-shabbat/ For various reasons most authorities permit this indirect causation if the power- plant is operated by non-Jews.Broyde and Jachter, part II, section E. (If the power plant is operated by Jews, the issue is more complicated. See the section below regarding Israeli power plants.) =Heating a wire or filament= Injecting current into a wire might cause that wire to heat to the temperature of yad soledet bo. According to the Chazon Ish, this would cause operation of such a device to be forbidden.Chazon Ish, Orach Chaim 50:9 However, R' Auerbach disagrees, saying that heating metal is only prohibited when the intent is to modify the metal (e.g. tempering).Minchat Shlomo, p. 107 Some feel that the prevalence of solid-state technology has made the reality underlying this concern obsolete in many cases.Broyde and Jachter, part II, section F. =Custom= Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach rejected any technical prohibition on electricity: \\"In my opinion there is no prohibition [to use electricity] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of Fine-tuning or molid... (However, I [Rabbi Auerbach] am afraid that the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Sabbath, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Sabbath unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame.\\" However, he considered the use of electricity forbidden by custom, and thus would only permit its use in situations of great need. Practical applications In general, from an Orthodox perspective, it is permissible to benefit from most electrical objects during Shabbat, provided they are preset before the start of Shabbat, and the status of the appliance is not manually modified during Shabbat. These include lights, heating, and air conditioning. =Cooking appliances= Cooking on Shabbat, whether by electrical or other means, is generally prohibited on Shabbat. Food may be kept hot when it is cooked before the start of Shabbat. There are various laws governing how this food is kept hot and served. Often, a blech or crock pot is used for this purpose. =Refrigerators= Though most Shabbat observant Jews permit opening and closing a refrigerator during Shabbat, some authorities require that the door only be opened when the refrigerator motor is already running. Otherwise, the motor will be caused to go on sooner by the increase in temperature indirectly caused by the flow of heat from the outside. Most refrigerators and freezers automatically turn the motor on to operate the cooling pump whenever the thermostat detects a temperature that is too high to keep the food cold. However, Auerbach and most authorities permit opening the door because this result is indirect and because there are additional grounds to be lenient.Minchas Shlomo, Chapter 10; Broyde and Jachter, part IV, section A.Rabbi Chaim Jachter, Opening Refrigerators on Shabbat Additionally, any incandescent light which is triggered upon opening the door must be disconnected before Shabbat. It is not permitted to open the door if the light will turn on because, unlike with the motor running, the light turning on is a Biblical prohibition whereas the motor running may be a Rabbinic prohibition, and also, the light is turned on immediately as an effect of opening the refrigerator whereas the motor turning on is an indirect effect.Broyde and Jachter, footnote 59. Some appliance manufacturers have implemented subtle design aspects to accommodate Shabbat observant Jews. In 1998 Whirlpool‚Äôs KitchenAid line patented a ‚ÄúSabbath mode‚Äù, and since then many manufacturers have followed by offering similar options. These modes typically turn off the electronic displays, disable oven and refrigerator lights that turn on automatically, and utilize delay timers that allow for permitted temperature controls. According to Jon Fasman, ‚Äúabout half of all ovens and refrigerators on the market (including those made by GE, Whirlpool, and KitchenAid) now have a Sabbath mode.‚Äù =Thermostats= Some rabbinic authorities have questioned that if a thermostat for a heating or air conditioning system is set prior to the start of Shabbat, if changes made to the temperature of the room in which the thermostat is contained may impact the system's on/off status. Of particular concern is an action that intentionally triggers the thermostat; for example, if the thermostat is set to turn on the room's heat, and an occupant of the room wishes the heater would turn on, opening a window to allow cold air into the room, thereby triggering the heat to turn on. While most rabbis have ruled that the example of intentionally letting cold air into the room to operate the thermostat constitutes a violation of Shabbat, if the person opens the window for some other, legitimate, reason, and the cold air enters as a side effect, no violation has occurred. Additionally, most agree that if a person who has no intention to operate the thermostat does something which happens to operate it, no violation has occurred. A few rabbinical authorities have completely forbidden the use of heating or cooling systems controlled by a thermostat on Shabbat, declaring that human actions that trigger the system on or off constitute a violation, regardless of intention. While (in general) it is prohibited to adjust an electric device so that it turns on or off sooner, many authorities permit adjusting it so an expected change will be delayed and the current state preserved for longer.Peninei Halakha - 06. Timers According to the permissive opinion if a heating system is currently off (because the temperature is currently higher than the thermostat setting), one would be permitted to lower the thermostat, as this causes the heating system to remain in its current \\"off\\" state for longer. =Television and radio= Most rabbinical authorities have prohibited watching television during Shabbat, even if the TV is turned on before the start of Shabbat, and its settings are not changed. However, most rabbis have permitted programming a device to record television programmes during Shabbat, the programming to be done before the start of Shabbat and the viewing after. Most authorities also prohibit either turning on or listening to a radio. The reason is, although an electric current is not turned on, the radio makes a loud noise, falling under the Rabbinic prohibition of making noise with an instrument designed to make noise. However, it may be permitted to turn up the volume of a radio that is already on because many authorities permit adding to an electric current. Eliezer Waldenberg says that changing the station on a radio by using a dial is prohibited, but Shlomo Auerbach says that it is permitted.Jachter and Broyde, part IV, section C. Regardless of permissibility, almost all authorities (including Conservative Nevins) consider that watching television, listening to a radio, or use of appliances for similar purposes on Shabbat violates the spirit of Shabbat and is not ideal. =Computers and similar appliances= In addition to possible halachic issues with any use of electricity, some additional issues may apply when using electronic devices such as computers. Writing on the screen Opinions differ regarding causing text to appear on an electronic screen (such as a computer screen or cellphone). Many argue that since the text will only appear on the screen for a short period, the Biblical prohibition on writing and erasing permanent text is not violated, so the action is only forbidden by rabbinic law.Rabbis Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Shulchan Shlomo 340:11), Moshe Feinstein, and Dov Lior R' Shmuel Wosner was stricter, arguing that since text on the screen can last for a significant amount of time (i.e. an hour), it is considered \\"permanent\\" writing which is forbidden.Shevet haLevi 6:37, bringing the example of writing on one's body which is Biblically forbidden (Shabbat 104b) However, other authorities say that even according to R' Wosner's approach, the Biblical prohibition would not apply if the device has a screensaver which automatically replaces the screen contents after a short period, or if the device is battery-powered (and not plugged in) and will inevitably run out of battery in not too long.What‚Äôs Wrong With Texting on Shabbat? A Halachic Analysis This judgment may be affected by the type of display used. For example, when using a CRT display (but not later types of display), words which appear on a computer screen are actually flickering many times a second; according to some authorities this means that such writing is not considered writing at all.Rav Gedalyah Rabinowitz Halachah Urefu'ah (volume V) On the other hand, text on an E Ink display (such as an Amazon Kindle) remains permanently even if the device loses electric power (unless the user decides to change the text), which makes it Biblically forbidden.Reading a Kindle on Shabbat Writing to disk Another issue is recording information on a computer (e.g. saving a file, or sending a text message which will be stored on a server or on the recipient's phone). Conservative Rabbi Daniel Nevins wrote that such recording violates the Biblical prohibition of writing. Among Orthodox authorities, opinions are divided on whether magnetic recording violates the prohibition of writing. In addition, R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach argued that recording may violate a separate Biblical prohibition of \\"building\\", since one is creating the capability for the computer to show you this information later on.Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchata, chapter 66 footnote 211 ◊û◊ê. ◊î◊¢◊ì◊§◊™ ◊õ◊™◊ô◊ë◊î ◊ë\\"◊¢◊ò ◊©◊ë◊™\\" ◊¢◊ú ◊§◊†◊ô ◊õ◊™◊ô◊ë◊î ◊ë◊û◊ó◊©◊ë Other considerations It is also questionable whether the use of a keyboard or other input device to change what is displayed is a direct effect, as it depends both on the keyboard and on the device's pre-programmed behavior. Regarding printing a document on paper, some authorities view it as grama and only rabbinically prohibited (since the printing only occurs after some time and after the computer has calculated how best to print), while others view it as straightforward writing and thus Biblically prohibited. The use of a computer might be considered \\"Uvdin d'Chol\\" (weekday/mundane activities), which are prohibited rabbinically in order to preserve the spirit of the sanctity of Shabbat, by preventing one from carrying out unrequired or grueling tasks and weekday-specific activities on Shabbat. R' Nahum Rabinovitch ruled that soldiers (who need to write in order to save lives) should preferably use a pen with disappearing ink (which is rabbinically prohibited as the writing is temporary) rather than electronic writing on a computer, indicating what he saw as the seriousness of the prohibitions involved in using a computer. The Shabbos App was a proposed Android app claimed by its creators to enable Jews to permissibly use a smartphone to text on Shabbat. Developers stated that the application would be released in December 2014, but the app was delayed and eventually never released. When announced, the app caused an uproar among the public, and many rabbis spoke out against the development. =Telephones= Like other electrical appliances, telephones are bound by similar restrictions on Shabbat. Operating a telephone may involve separate prohibitions at each stage of the operation. Thus, removing a telephone from the receiver to produce a dial tone closes a circuit and makes a noise. Dialing closes more circuits and creates more noises. Speaking on the phone increases an existing current, but Shlomo Auerbach and many other authorities permit this. Hanging up the phone opens a circuit, which is a Biblical prohibition of \\"destroying\\" according to the Chazon Ish but a Rabbinic prohibition according to others.Broyde and Jachter, part IV, section B. Dialing on many phones, including cell phones, also causes the numbers to be written on a display screen, thus violating the prohibition of writing (as described above). If a phone call must be made on Shabbat, other factors being equal, it is preferable to use a phone without a display screen. It is questionable if it is permissible to use an answering machine or voicemail to receive messages left during Shabbat, since one is benefiting from a violation of Shabbat, particularly if the caller is a Jew.J. David Bleich. Contemporary Halachic Problems, volume 5, pages 157-170. In an emergency case where a phone call must be made to save a life, making the phone call is permitted. In addition, a special phone has been invented to minimize the halachic issues regarding phone use on Shabbat; the inventors argue that its use by soldiers or other essential workers in less urgent situations is permitted. This phone is marketed as a \\"kosher phone\\" (unrelated to \\"kosher phones\\" in some other Jewish communities, which lack internet or media access in order to comply with bans on the internet in those communities). =Microphones= There are varying views on the use of a microphone during Shabbat. While most Orthodox rabbinic authorities prohibit the use of microphones, there has been some argument for allowing the use of a microphone in a synagogue that is turned on before the start of Shabbat on the basis that a microphone does not create a human voice, but rather amplifies it. Those in the majority, who forbid the microphone, have various concerns, including the conduction of electricity that is affected by the human voice, and the attention that is drawn from the sound coming from the speakers. A \\"Shabbat microphone\\" has been developed, which is intended to allow Rabbis or Hazzans to amplify and transmit their voice without affecting the electrical current of the microphone in order to hold congregations without violating Shabbat. It uses acousto-fluidic technology and constant electric current, so the sound source does not change the status of the electric current. It has not been approved by all Orthodox rabbinic authorities. Rabbis disagree about whether even a Shabbat microphone can be used when the sound is being recorded.On Recording Shabbat and Yom Tov Services =Laundry= Washing clothes is not permitted on Shabbat, whether by hand or machine. Most rabbinical authorities have prohibited allowing a washing machine or dryer to run on Shabbat, even if it is set before the start of Shabbat. If the machine is still running after Shabbat starts when this was not planned, no benefit may be derived from clothes or other objects in the appliance during that Shabbat. =Automobiles= According to Orthodox authorities, while driving on Shabbat is prohibited directly because of the combustion of fuel, modern automobiles also have numerous electrical components whose operation is prohibited during Shabbat. These include headlamps and other external and internal lights, turn signals, and gauges. Additionally, the operation of the vehicle involves many uses of electricity and electrical circuits. According to many Conservative authorities, this use of electricity is not prohibited, and it may even be permitted to drive a car powered by an internal combustion engine in certain circumstances. =Elevators= Operating an elevator is generally prohibited by Orthodox authorities for multiple reasons. However, Shabbat elevators have been designed automatically to travel from one floor to the next regardless of whether a human is riding the elevator or not, so many authorities permit the use of such elevators under certain circumstances. The environmental advantages of reducing energy consumption when the device is not in use are lost. =Surveillance systems= The use of automated surveillance systems has been reviewed. Examples include closed-circuit television, video cameras, and motion detectors.J. David Bleich, Contemporary Halakhic Problems, volume 5, pages 129-156. A person who walks within view of an operating surveillance camera may permit photography if the camera must be passed to enter a building or location and the photograph is not of direct benefit to the passerby. This is called a (Aramaic: ◊§◊°◊ô◊ß ◊®◊ô◊©◊ê ◊ì◊ú◊ê ◊†◊ô◊ó◊ê ◊ú◊ô◊î, loose translation: \\"an inevitable resultant action that does not benefit the one who indirectly caused that action\\").Bleich, ibid. However, it is prohibited to knowingly walk past a motion sensor which switches on a light on Shabbat if the street or place is dark and because the turning on of the light substantively benefits the person, and it is a (Aramaic: ◊§◊°◊ô◊ß ◊®◊ô◊©◊ê ◊ì◊†◊ô◊ó◊ê ◊ú◊ô◊î, loose translation: \\"an inevitable resultant action that does benefit the one who indirectly caused that action\\"). Observant Jews are advised to avoid walking past a motion sensor that they know is there and will switch on a light, or close their eyes when doing so.Ribiat, loc. cit. =Static electricity= Many authorities permit separating clothes or performing other actions that might generate sparks due to static electricity.Broyde and Jachter, part IV, section D. =Milking of cows= Some review articles have been published on the permissibility of milking cows on Shabbat using automated machines.Howard Jachter and Ezra Frazer, Gray Matter, volume 1, pages 201-214.Techumin 15:394-410, cited in Jachter and Frazer 1:213. Milking cows is fundamentally prohibited on Shabbat,Due to (Hebrew: ◊û◊§◊®◊ß), a subcategory of dash (Hebrew: ◊ì◊© threshing); Shabbat 95a, cited in Jachter and Frazer 1:200. but is permitted in order to relieve the suffering of an engorged cow, as long as the milk is allowed to go to waste rather than being stored.R' Abraham Isaac Kook permitted dairy farmers to ask a non-Jew to milk the cow, in accordance with a medieval ruling by Maharam of Rothenburg. Although milking a cow is a Biblical prohibition, asking a non-Jew to perform a prohibited act on Shabbat is only a Rabbinic prohibition, so to alleviate the animal's pain it is permitted (Jachter and Frazer 1:202). On religious kibbutzim in Israel where only Jews live, it may not be practical to ask non-Jews to milk the cows. Rav Kook, acknowledging this reality in his time, and the Chazon Ish permitted milking a cow and allowing the milk to be wasted because this too is only a Rabbinic prohibition and can be permitted because of the mitigating factor to prevent the cow from feeling pain (Jachter and Frazer 1:204). Due to the desire that so much milk not go to waste, it was proposed to attach the pumping machine on Shabbat, to let the first few drops go to waste, then position a container to store the subsequent milk flow. While the Chazon Ish wrote that such a practice is forbidden, he is reported to have permitted it when asked orally, and some communities have used the practice accordingly.Haim Navon, National Law: Class 21, Milking on Shabbat Using a device invented by the Zomet Institute in the 1980s, which allowed the switch from milking to waste to milking into containers to occur indirectly without human intervention, the act of milking cows became more indirect and thus more likely to be permitted.Jachter and Frazer 1:206-9. Yet another solution, whereby the cows are hooked up to the machine with electricity off, and the electricity is soon turned on automatically to milk the cows, was permitted in theory by the Chazon Ish and became practical in the late 20th century. It is currently practiced by the religious kibbutz at Sde Eliyahu.Jachter and Frazer 1:210-214. Ways of circumventing the Shabbat prohibitions Several innovations have been developed to address the needs of the Shabbat-observant user while not violating Shabbat. =Shabbat clocks= 3-prong Israeli socket). In general, halacha permits a Jew to begin a Shabbat-violating action on Friday (before Shabbat) even though the action will be completed automatically on Shabbat.Shabbat 17b-18a; Mishneh Torah, Laws of Shabbat 3:1; Shulchan Aruch Orach Haim 252:1 Therefore, the consensus of contemporary authorities permits a Jew to program a timer (referred to as a \\"Shabbat clock\\") before Shabbat to perform automatically a prohibited action on Shabbat. For example, it is permitted to attach a timer to a light switch on Friday afternoon so that the light will turn off late on Friday night when people wish to sleep, and will turn on again the next day when people are awake. However, an exception to this rule may be the production of a noise which disturbs the peaceful environment of Shabbat, as shown by a debate in the Talmud over whether a Jew may add wheat on Friday to a water mill that will run automatically on Shabbat, because the addition of wheat to the mill will cause a loud noise.Shabbat 18a Rishonim disagree as to which opinion is normative. Joseph Caro in the Shulchan Aruch permits this action, but Moses Isserles (the Ramo) prohibits it absent great need.Torah Musings, Timers on Shabbat and Yom Tov Accordingly, Rabbis Moses Feinstein and Shlomo Auerbach prohibit programming a radio to turn on during Shabbat, or allowing it to run on Shabbat, not because of the violation of electricity as such, but rather because the noise of the radio violates a separate prohibition. Some authorities have raised other reasons to prohibit Shabbat clocks in general, but the consensus of many rabbis permits their use.Broyde and Jachter, section V, part A. Nowadays they are commonly used to manage lights in private homes, to operate dishwashers and milk cows in Shabbat-observant kibbutzim and moshavim, and for various purposes in public facilities such as hospitals and hotels. Adjusting a Shabbat clock on Shabbat Shabbat clocks are typically mechanical devices that are \\"programmed\\" by moving pegs that represent specific hours. One is permitted on Shabbat to move pegs on a mechanical device, but when the pegs are part of a Shabbat clock, the resulting activity (e.g. turning on a light) may be forbidden. Several different cases must be considered: * Adjusting the shabbat clock so that a light turns on, sooner than it otherwise would have: This is forbidden, though some authorities are lenient in situations of need, since this can be considered turning on the light indirectly (grama).Peninei Halakha: TimersBroyde and Jachter, part V, section B. * Adjusting the shabbat clock so that a light turns on, later than it otherwise would have: Nearly all authorities permit this, and the common practice is to permit it. However, if the adjustment is done by removing and reinserting a peg, the reinsertion could cause the light to turn on earlier relative to the state of no peg, which would likely be forbidden as previously discussed. * Adjusting the shabbat clock so that a light turns off, sooner than it otherwise would have: This is similar to the case of turning the light on sooner, and thus forbidden. However, the act of turning off a light is less halachically serious than turning it on (a rabbinic rather than Biblical prohibition), so R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach permits if the light (or other device) is of a type whose operation is only rabbinically forbidden, as the multiple layers of rabbinic prohibition create more grounds for leniency. * Adjusting the shabbat clock so that a light turns off, later than it otherwise would have: This is similar to the case of turning the light on later, and thus permitted. (A minority of authorities hold it is forbidden due to causing more electricity to be consumed than would have otherwise.) =Other proposed bypasses= The KosherLamp, sold since 2004, is a lamp in which the electricity runs continually, but which contains a sliding cover so that the light can be exposed or blocked as desired. Thus, the lamp can be \\"turned on\\" or \\"turned off\\" even though in reality the bulb is always on. In 2015, the KosherSwitch wall switch was introduced amid controversy, as a means of controlling electricity on-demand in a manner that is permissible according to several Orthodox authorities. Use of electricity generated in Israeli power plants Several review articles have been written about the permissibility of using electricity generated in Israeli power plants.Howard Jachter and Ezra Frazer, Gray Matter, volume 2, pages 54-66; Levi Yitzchak Halperin, Teshuvot Ma'aseh Chosheiv 1:31, and Yisrael Rozen, Techumin 16:36-50 (cited in Jachter and Frazer 2:55). In principle, it should be prohibited because one may not benefit from an action performed in violation of Shabbat. Thus, for example, if a Jew lights a candle in violation of Shabbat, both he and other Jews are forbidden to read a book using that candlelight. Similarly, if a Jew generates electricity in a power plant in violation of Shabbat, other Jews may not benefit from that electricity. However, there are several considerations to permit Jews to generate electricity in Israeli power plants and to use electricity generated in this manner. =Generating electricity= The primary motive to permit generating electricity is (Hebrew: ◊§◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ó ◊†◊§◊©, \\"saving lives\\"). Electricity generated on Shabbat is needed for the day-to-day operations of hospitals, first aid centers, outpatients who require medical care in their homes, and climate control for people who need it, a refrigerator for a baby or the elderly who must eat refrigerated food, and possibly street lights which help prevent road accidents. Because it is impossible to distinguish between the electric current going to purposes recognised as and to other purposes, all electricity generation is classified as . The argument based on would allow a Jew to work at the power plant on Shabbat to generate electricity. Rabbis Shlomo Zalman AuerbachTeshuvot Minchat Shlomo 2:15 and Tinyana 24. Cited in Jachter and Frazer 2:56. and Shlomo GorenMeishiv Milchamah 1:366-385. Cited in Jachter and Frazer 2:56. permit this, but Auerbach and Moshe FeinsteinTeshuvot Igrot Moshe (Orach Chaim 4:127). Cited in Jachter and Frazer 2:56. question why non-Jews are not employed to do this work instead. =Using electricity= Assuming that a Jewish worker may generate electricity on Shabbat due to , opinions are divided on whether Jewish consumers may use this electricity for non- purposes. R' Shlomo Goren prohibits using it in ordinary circumstances using a Talmudic precedent: if meat is cooked for a patient who needs it for , nobody else may eat that meat, as this possibility could encourage the cook to prepare more meat than necessary, violating Shabbat without justification. However, R' Shlomo Auerbach, who permits the generation of electricity on Shabbat with some hesitation (see citation below), also permits the use of electricity based on a different Talmudic precedent: if a sick patient requires meat, and no dead meat is available, a live animal may be slaughtered (otherwise in violation of Shabbat) and its excess meat may be consumed by others on Shabbat. Since in this case, there is no way to cook any meat without slaughtering a whole animal, the rationale that the violator might do more than necessary does not hold.Cited in Jachter and Frazer 2:56-57. Another possible reason for leniency is the fact that some Jewish power plant workers are unaware their work is considered Shabbat violation. Thus, it could be considered unintentional (Hebrew: ◊©◊ï◊í◊í, ). When a person violates Shabbat unintentionally (as opposed to intentionally), some authorities permit other Jews to benefit from the violation. Thus, customers might be allowed to use electricity generated on Shabbat.◊©◊ô◊û◊ï◊© ◊ë◊ó◊©◊û◊ú ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™ Nowadays, it is generally accepted that consumers may use electricity from the power plant.Tahanat Koach Hashmalit beShabbat05\\\\. Using Electricity that Was Produced on Shabbat However, part of the charedi community refuses to use the electric grid (instead of running electricity generators at home), following the opinion of the Chazon Ish who argued that even if a power plant could run permissibly, using its electricity would be forbidden, as the secular workers there do not respect Shabbat and using their electricity would show public approval of their actions. It is projected that in the future, when Israel's coal generating plants are shut down and replaced with natural gas power plants, it will be possible to run all-electric plants automatically without human intervention, removing the halachic questions about the use of this electricity on Shabbat.◊ó◊©◊û◊ú ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™ =Alternatives to publicly generated electricity= Tens of thousands of Israeli haredim, forming a significant fraction of the Haredi population, run private electric generators to avoid using the public electricity supply on Shabbat.◊ú◊ê ◊î◊õ◊ú \\"◊õ◊©◊®\\" ◊ë◊í◊†◊®◊ò◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊î◊ó◊®◊ì◊ô◊ù Some even refuse to use a generator because the end-product of electricity is indistinguishable from what is provided to ordinary consumers, so using electricity in any manner constitutes the appearance of violating Halakhah. Some of these people use a kerosene lamp that provides them with a minimal amount of light, and some use only Shabbat candles for Friday night dinner. Some people who do not use electricity also do not use faucets or other mechanisms that provide water from public supplies, because the municipal water pumps are operated electrically. These people prepare containers of water on Friday sufficient to provide for their needs on Shabbat.

He worked as a farm labourer on his family land, and completed high school when he turned 20, in 1920, from the Hunan 3rd Normal School. Huang eventually joined Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army, and he joined the Communist Party of China in 1925. In 1929, Huang was serving under Peng Dehuai in a Kuomintang regiment stationed in northern Hunan. When Peng rebelled in June 1928, Huang joined him.Domes 48 Huang led the Yongxing campaign during Xiangnan (South Hunan) campaign in 1928, and participated major battles encountered by the Red Army Third Division. Huang participated in the Long March, and, upon arrival on northern Shaanxi, he was promoted to be the director of the general political and organizational department. In the beginning of the Second Sino-Japan War, he was the political commissar of 344 brigade, affiliated with the 115 division of Eighth Route Army. His army accompanied Xu Haidong, fighting in regions across Shanxi, Hebei and Henan. After 1940, he became a political commissar in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and later the deputy and logistics commander of Northeastern Democratic Alliance Army. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Huang was appointed governor of Tianjin. He later became the state secretary of Hunan, the Commander of Hunan Military Region and its political commissar, the deputy director of the chief staff and director of general logistics, the deputy minister of national defense, the secretary general of the Central Military Commission, and the chief of staff of the PLA. He was made a senior general in 1955, and awarded the Army Medal, the Order of Independence and Freedom Medal, and the Order of Liberation. He was an alternate and then formal member of the 7th CPC Central Committee, and a member of the 8th Central Committee. In 1959, Huang criticized the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" and \\"People's Communes\\" and was denounced as a member of an \\"Anti- Party group\\" associated with Peng Dehuai when Peng was criticized at the Lushan Conference. He was deprived of all positions and was placed under investigation. He was partially rehabilitated, but was denounced and persecuted by Red Guards when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. In 1977, after Deng Xiaoping came to power, Huang was politically rehabilitated. After being recalled to service, he was appointed as adviser to the Central Military Commission, and executive secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. He was selected as central committee member again in 1978. He died on December 28, 1986 in Beijing.  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Domes, Jurgen.

Procedure  With the patient in the supine position, the leg is flexed at the hip and raised above heart level. The veins will empty due to gravity or with the assistance of the examiner's hand squeezing blood towards the heart. A tourniquet is then applied around the upper thigh to compress the superficial veins but not too tight as to occlude the deeper veins. The leg is then lowered by asking the patient to stand. Normally the superficial saphenous vein will fill from below within 30‚Äì35 seconds as blood from the capillary beds reaches the veins; if the superficial veins fill more rapidly with the tourniquet in place there is valvular incompetence below the level of the tourniquet in the \\"deep\\" or \\"communicating\\" veins. After 20 seconds, if there has been no rapid filling, the tourniquet is released. If there is sudden filling at this point, it indicates that the deep and communicating veins are competent but the superficial veins are incompetent.Bates Guide to Physical Exam and History Taking. Lynn Bickley. Lippincott The test is reported in two parts, the initial standing up of the patient (positive or negative based on rapid filling) and the second phase once the tourniquet is removed (positive or negative based upon rapid filling). For example, a possible outcome of the test would be negative- positive meaning that the initial phase of the test was negative indicating competence in the deep and communicating veins and the second phase of the test was positive meaning that there is superficial vein incompetence. The test can be repeated with the tourniquet at different levels to further pinpoint the level of valvular incompetence: * above the knee - to assess the mid-thigh perforators * below the knee - to assess incompetence between the short saphenous vein and the popliteal vein. Superficial veins of the leg normally empty into deep veins, however retrograde filling occurs when valves are incompetent, leading to varicose veins. The test is named for Friedrich Trendelenburg, who described it in 1891.

The 19th century French Catholic missionary Claude- Charles Dallet wrote of him in his A history of the church in Korea, \\"His history proves, in a dazzling way, that God would rather make a miracle than abandon an infidel who follows the lights of his conscience, and seeks the truth with an upright and docile heart.\\" Biography Caius was born in Korea and was given to a Buddhist monastery by his parents. He left the monastery because he could not find the peace that he wanted there and went to a mountain to live as a hermit. According to Dallet, \\"He withdrew into solitude to meditate with more ease on this happiness which he sought. He had as a dwelling only a cave, which he shared with a tiger, which occupied it before him. This wild animal respected its guest; it even yielded the cave to him some time after, and withdrew elsewhere.\\" Caius only ate what was necessary to preserve his life, abstaining from anything that was not absolutely necessary to live. One night, while in meditation, a man of \\"majestic aspect\\" appeared to him, and said to him, In 1592, Japan invaded Korea, and Caius was taken prisoner. On the journey to Japan, they were shipwrecked at Tsushima Island, and Caius, near death, was taken to Kyoto. A Christian named Caius Foyn, the father of his mistress, nursed him back to health.Pag√®s, L√©on. Le martyologe de l'√©glise du Japon (1869) p. 600 Allured by the life of the Buddhist monks, he felt that he had found what he had been seeking for many years, and went to live in one of the most famous pagodas in Kyoto. Again he felt that he could not find the peace that he wanted there, and he became ill. During his illness, he had a dream in which he saw the pagoda ablaze. Then a \\"child of a charming beauty\\" appeared to him in his dream, comforting him, saying, He found himself cured after the dream. In The Victories of the Martyrs by Saint Alphonsus de Ligouri, it is said that: \\"One day during sleep it seemed to him that the house was on fire: a little while afterwards a young child of ravishing beauty appeared to him, and announced to him that he would soon meet what he desired; at the same time he felt himself quite well, though he had been sick. Despairing of seeing among the bonzes the light for which he was longing, he resolved to leave them.\\" Caius then left the temple and went back to his master, who introduced him to a Christian, who in turn introduced him to some Jesuit priests. He converted to Catholicism and was baptised immediately. While he was instructed, one of the priests showed him a tableau representing Jesus Christ, at which Caius is said to have exclaimed, Caius served the sick, especially lepers. In 1614, he went to Spanish Philippines in order to work as a servant to the Dom Justo Takayama, a samurai who had been exiled for his Catholic faith. After Takayama died in 1615, Caius returned to Japan, and resumed his duties as a catechist. He helped the missionaries by preaching in his native language to the Koreans who had been taken to Japan after the Japanese invasion of Korea, as well as to the Japanese. On 15 November 1624, Caius was burnt at the stake with James Coici (Koichi), a Japanese Catholic, after he was arrested for harbouring missionaries.

It is home to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (the state's highest court) and the Massachusetts Appeals Court. Built in 1893, it was the major work of Boston's first city architect, George Clough, and is one of the city's few surviving late 19th-century monumental civic buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description The John Adams Courthouse is located on the west side of Pemberton Square, now little more than an open plaza bounded by the courthouse on the west, and the backside of the curved Center Plaza building, which faces Tremont Street opposite the Boston City Hall plaza. The courthouse is a six-story granite structure, fifteen bays wide, with an eclectic stylistic composition. Its first 1-1/2 floor function by appearance as an elevated basement, with small arched windows close to the ground, above which are larger rectangular windows divided in the upper third by a stone stringcourse. Above this basement level is an arcaded mezzanine of large round-arch openings in which paired sash windows are topped by a half-round transom. A dentillated cornice separates this level from a narrower band of three-part windows, above which is a two- level mansard roof pierced by a variety of dormers. There are projecting pavilions at the ends of the main facade, rising to the top of the mezzanine level on the sides, and the full roof height on the front. History The courthouse was built in 1893 to a design by Boston city architect George Clough. Stylistically the building was described at the time as \\"German Renaissance\\"; it is now viewed as transitional between the monumental Second Empire style of Boston's Old City Hall and the Classical Revival. Of the many buildings Clough designed for the city, this is his largest and most elaborate design. Clough also designed the 1909 enlargement of the structure, which added the French Chateau-style roof. From 1893 to 1938, the Supreme Judicial Court and the Social Law Library occupied the building, known then as the Suffolk County Courthouse. In 2002, the Supreme Judicial Court, the Massachusetts Appeals Court, and the Social Law Library returned to the restored building, which was renamed the John Adams Courthouse.

It was broadcast between 1984 and 1993. The series was a follow on from Take Hart and taught children how to design art features and use everyday items to make objects. History Like its predecessor Take Hart, Hartbeat featured Hart and the animated Plasticine character Morph and taught children how to design art features and use everyday items to make objects. The first episode was screened on 14 September 1984. Throughout its run it was shown during the afternoons with the first series on Fridays as a standalone programme. The second series onwards adopted the Children's BBC branding in 1985, when the service was launched, at which time it was moved to Wednesday afternoons where it remained until the series ended in 1993. Each episode was approximately half an hour in length. Theme Hartbeat continued the themes covered by Take Hart but was a deliberate attempt to update the image of its predecessor. A more modern set of opening titles using rudimentary CGI and a synthesised theme tune were introduced. The theme tune was composed by David Owen Smith. Several young female co-presenters were added, initially alternating between Margot Wilson, Joanna Kirk, Gabrielle Bradshaw, Alison Millar and Liza Brown. The studio backdrops were also changed to reflect the new direction of the series. In another attempt to move away from the format of Take Hart, a storyline was also featured in each episode to keep casual viewers interested, generally revolving around a topic ‚Äì e.g. a broken computer, Tony's birthday or something similar. Some fans of Take Hart felt that the inclusion of storylines was upstaging the premise of the show. The \\"Gallery\\" segment, as featured in both Take Hart and its predecessor Vision On, in which viewers would send in their own artworks, also remained in the series and has continued to be used since 1994 in the BBC Children's programme SMart. In addition, with the advent of computers in schools at this time, Hart would often arrange for professional graphic designers to visit the studio so that they could demonstrate the use of computers in art and craft and show off the latest software made for this purpose. Colin Bennett continued playing the role of Mr Bennett, the bumbling caretaker from Take Hart, and the end of each episode normally featured a humorous segment where Mr Bennett would distract Tony while in the middle of a task (such as filling up a sink to do the washing up), then after the closing credits Tony would be shown dealing with aftermath caused by Mr Bennett's distraction (such as the sink overflowing and flooding the studio). In the 1989 series Mr Bennett was replaced with the dotty tea lady Elvira Muckett played by Amanda Swift. Elvira could generally be heard calling \\"Te-ea!\\" and would \\"annoyingly\\" refer to Tony and the co- presenter of the day as \\"Mr and Mrs Hartbeat\\". Her first appearance featured her humming the original Take Hart theme \\"Left Bank Two\\" in an attempt to appeal to longer-term viewers. Eventually Elvira was replaced by an accident- prone cleaning-lady named Alison in 1992 in an attempt to bring back the \\"comedy\\" element left by Mr Bennett's departure. Popularity In its heyday between 1984 and 1990 Hartbeat regularly attracted over 5 million viewers which was, at the time, a very high figure for a children's television series in the UK., and was one of the most popular series broadcast on Children's BBC. The popularity of the series led to repeats being screened on the Children's BBC segment of BBC 2's short-lived daytime television service, Daytime on Two, in a morning slot, during school holidays between 1986 and 1989. By 1992 Hartbeat was felt to have become a shadow of its former self and, with viewing figures on the wane, the BBC finally decided to discontinue the series a year later. The final episode was screened on 17 November 1993. Hart's retirement Following the cancellation of Hartbeat Tony Hart took a break from presenting for two years before reemerging in the show Artbox Bunch for two series in 1995 and 1996 and then in Smart Hart for two series in 1999 and 2000 before announcing his retirement from television in 2001.

A member of one of England's most prominent artistic and literary families, her unconventional political trajectory began with anarchism, continued with the League of Nations, and ended with Italian fascism. Her involvement with the latter led to an important correspondence and friendship with Ezra Pound, who mentions her twice in his Cantos.  Anarchism  Olivia Frances Madox Rossetti was born in London to William Michael Rossetti, one of the seven founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the editor of its literary magazine The Germ and Lucy Madox Brown. A granddaughter of Gabriele Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown, she was hence a niece of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, as well as a first cousin of Ford Madox Ford, Oliver Madox Hueffer and Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer (the mother of Frank Soskice) through her mother's half-sister Catherine Madox Brown. While still in their girlhood, Olivia and her sister, the future Helen Rossetti Angeli (1879-1969), began publishing an anarchist journal, The Torch, in the basement of their family home. Despite their youth, this effort became the nucleus of a prominent anarchist salon which included Peter Kropotkin and Sergei Kravchinski, and their publishing coups included the pamphlet Why I Am an Anarchist by George Bernard Shaw. Years later, using the pseudonym \\"Isabel Meredith\\", Olivia and Helen published A Girl Among the Anarchists, a somewhat fictionalized memoir of their days as precocious child revolutionaries. These adventures were also chronicled by their cousin Ford Madox Ford in his 1931 memoir Return to Yesterday.Olivia Rossetti Agresti Papers. Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library Finding Aid. \\"\\" A more permanent consequence of this political activity was Olivia's marriage in 1897 to the Italian anarchist and journalist Antonio Agresti (1866-1926), which led to her emigration from England to Italy. Olivia was to remain there for the rest of her life and she eventually became an Italian citizen. During her first years in Italy she continued with literary activities related to her political activism, including a biography of the Italian painter and revolutionary Giovanni Costa.  Internationalism  The second phase in Agresti's career began in 1904, when she met the American agricultural reformer David Lubin. A former department store and mail order magnate from Sacramento, Lubin was in Rome seeking a state sponsor for his idea of an international clearinghouse for agricultural statistics. Unable to speak Italian, Lubin hired Agresti as his interpreter and thus began a close collaboration between the two which continued until Lubin's death. With Agresti's assistance, Lubin's efforts in Italy made history. After gaining the unexpected support of Italy's king Victor Emmanuel III, Lubin's vision became a reality with the 1905 founding of the International Institute of Agriculture, headquartered in Rome. The first modern international organization, it was hailed as a significant forerunner of world government by such luminaries as H. G. Wells and Louis Brandeis. Agresti includes samples of Lubin's correspondence with Wells and Brandeis in her 1922 biography David Lubin: A Study in Practical Idealism. Following Lubin's death in 1919, Agresti waged a public campaign for close cooperation between the International Institute of Agriculture and the nascent League of Nations, which soon employed her as a member of the staff to Italy's delegation. She continued as a staff interpreter for the League in Geneva from 1922 to 1930. Her last assignment as a professional interpreter occurred in 1945 when, at the personal request of Italy's prime minister, Alcide De Gasperi, she accompanied him to London for meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers. According to her unpublished memoirs, meetings at which Agresti interpreted included Ernest Bevin and Vyacheslav Molotov.  Fascism  By 1921 Agresti's early anarchist leanings, further leavened by years of exposure to Lubin's theories concerning cooperative organization of society, had transformed her into an enthusiastic supporter of corporatism and, consequently, of Benito Mussolini's corporatist reorganization of the Italian economy. From 1921 to 1943 she edited the newsletter of the Associazione fra le Societ√† per Azioni, a group then closely allied with the Fascists, and in 1938 co-authored the theoretical work The Organization of the Arts and Professions in the Fascist Guild State with the Fascist journalist Mario Missiroli. In 1937, Agresti's editorship of economic journals brought her into professional contact with Ezra Pound, then residing in Italy and writing articles in Italian on economic topics. Thus began a long correspondence between the two which lasted until 1959, the year before Agresti's death. Agresti seems to have been unaware of Pound's fame as a poet, and Pound unaware of Agresti's family ties to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Ford, two of the most important influences on his poetry, until years into the correspondence. Portions of this correspondence were edited and published in 1998 by the University of Illinois Press. Agresti became practically a member of Pound's extended family as the years progressed, and she and her two adopted Italian daughters were frequent guests at Schloss Brunnenburg. She was active for years in the international campaign to free Pound from his involuntary incarceration in a mental asylum by the government of the United States, and Pound in turn tried to assist her, then suffering from an impecunious old age, by finding a publisher for her memoirs. Pound refers to Agresti twice in his Cantos.  Selected works  *1903. A Girl Among the Anarchists (co-authored with her sister Helen under the pseudonym \\"Isabel Meredith\\").

The project includes a photo essay-style collection of aerial photography produced by Arthus-Bertrand, in which the photographer captured vistas of Earth from various aircraft during a ten-year period. It gave birth to a book also entitled Earth from Above, of which millions of copies were sold. Background Arthus-Bertrand founded the Altitude Agency in 1991, the world's first press agency and image bank specializing in aerial photography. The agency holds 350,000 \\"selected images\\" taken in more than a hundred countries. With a history of environmental activism, the photographer sought to exhibit his work at the Rio Conference in 1992, and eventually made a decision to document the condition of planet Earth. UN sponsorship In 1994, intent on conveying his perspective on environmental sustainability to other humans, Arthus-Bertrand successfully attained sponsorship from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the purposes of a long-term photographic project entitled, \\"The Earth From Above, Wild Animals, Horses, and 365 Days\\". Book Following the Rio summit, Arthus-Bertrand subsequently created a picture inventory of landscapes from across the world with each picture, and accompanying text, encouraging the reader to be responsible in their treatment of the earth. The book from the project, Earth from Above (French: La terre vue du ciel), sold several million copies and was translated into over 21 languages. Exhibitions As part of a series of outdoor displays, the \\"Earth from Above\\" free exhibition was set up at the gates of Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris, whereby the images appeared as big posters. At the conclusion of the first decade of the 21st century, the series of public exhibitions have been seen by over 200 million people. Film In 2007, Earth from Above was launched in a film format, broadcast on French national television as a 4-episode, 8-hour television series.

Italy for Russians has been the exemplar of the highest stages of culture, whether classical, Renaissance, or Baroque.2 For example, the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg was in part modeled after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

In 1914, Italy refused to follow its official allies Germany and Austria into World War I. It negotiated for a better deal with the Allies, especially in terms of gaining territory from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, Russia had its own interest in that region, and complicated negotiations. However Russia's negotiating position was greatly weakened by its heavy military losses. London and Paris insisted and Russia, by April 1915, abandoned its support for most of Serbia's claims and accepted terms for Italy's entry into the war, which would limit the Russian strategic presence in the postwar Adriatic.Paul Du Quenoy, \\"With allies like these, who needs enemies?: Russia and the problem of Italian entry into World War I.\\" Canadian Slavonic Papers 45.3-4 (2003): 409-440. =Italian-Soviet relations= The governments of Benito Mussolini's Italy and Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union recognized each other as de jure governments of their respective countries and established diplomatic relations on 7 February 1924 (shortly after the death of Vladimir Lenin). A preliminary agreement had been made on 26 December 1921, de facto recognizing the Soviet Union. The two states signed a Treaty on Friendship, Non-Aggression and Neutrality on 2 September 1933, and although the treaty formally remained in effect until the Italian declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, relations had already degraded with the advent of the Italo-Ethiopian War and the Spanish Civil War. Palmiro Togliatti was the longtime leader of the Communist Party in Italy, 1927‚Äì1964. He remained in Moscow when Mussolini's Fascist government arrested all the leading members of Italy's Communist Party. The Comintern, under Stalin's guidance, chose Togliatti as the party leader for Italy. He remained in Moscow but kept his Party solidly together. During World War II he directed the Italian Communist resistance, returning to Italy in 1944. Stalin did not permit the Italian Communist from making an effort to take over Italy in 1944-45. Togliatti kept in close touch with Moscow while becoming a major player in Italian politics. He was typically outmaneuvered by the Christian Democrats with their American allies.

The Soviet Union was in good standing with the League at the time, and generally applied the sanctions by sharply reducing trade with Italy. Lowell R. Tillett, \\"The Soviet Role in League Sanctions Against Italy, 1935-36.\\" American Slavic and East European Review 15.1 (1956): 11-16 online. In the late 1930s Hitler planned to gain 'Lebensraum' by invading the Soviet Union with support from Italy, co-operation with Poland, friendship with Britain, and the isolation of France. Italy was mildly supportive. However Hitler's program failed through Polish aloofness, British rejection of appeasement in 1939, Soviet strength, and the American entry into the War in support of the USSR. Hermann Lutz, \\"Foreign Policy in the Third Reich.\\" Current History ) 28#164 (1955): 222+. Even during World War II, when Italy was on Germany's side fighting against USSR, Italian troops were known for treating Soviet civilians much better than the Germans did. After the Italians signed an act of surrender to the Allied powers of World War II on 29 September 1943, at the Three Powers Conference in Moscow, the Soviets, Americans and British adopted the Declaration Regarding Italy, within which they agreed to the overthrow of Fascism in Italy, the barring of Fascists from public life and setting up \\"democratic organs.\\" The Soviet Union restored full diplomatic relations with Italy on 25 October 1944. A treaty on trade and navigation was signed on 11 December 1948. Nina D. Smirnova, \\"Soviet-Italian Relations, 1945‚Äì8.\\" in Francesca Gori, ed.

The PCI launched strikes, mass rallies, assaults on police stations, and occupations of factories. The U.S. responded by threatening military intervention in the event of a Communist coup. The Christian Democrats won on an anti-Communist platform and the Communists were frozen out of power at the national level in Italy, while still in control of local governments in industrial cities.

Italy had the largest communist party in the Western world, with over 2 million members in the PCI. After the Sino-Soviet Split, the Italian Communist Party PCI had much more maneuver room. While not officially aligning with China, they sharply disagreed with Moscow on numerous points: the PCI's \\"Historic compromise\\" and acceptance of pluralism at home, the Soviet Intervention in Czechoslovakia, relations with the Chinese Communist Party, and Soviet Interventions in Afghanistan and Poland. The Soviets offered concessions to win PCI support for its foreign policy. But when the PCI denounced Soviet actions in Poland and suggested that Soviet and American foreign policies were both obnoxious , Pravda denounced the \\"blasphemy\\" of the PCI. Joan Barth Urban, \\"Soviet policies and negotiating behavior toward nonruling communist parties: the case of the Italian communist party.\\" Studies in Comparative Communism 15.3 (1982): 184-211. As communism was falling apart in Russia, the PCI disintegrated in 1991, and split into the Democratic Party of the Left and the Communist Refoundation Party (\\"Rifondazione Comunista\\"). Toby Abse, \\"Rifondazione Comunista: a party of protest or a party of government?.\\" Socialist History 47 (2015): 64-89. =Russian Federation= In 2006, Russia and Italy signed a protocol of cooperation for fighting crime and defending civil liberties. There are close commercial ties between the two countries. Italy is Russia's second most important commercial partner in the EU, after Germany, and its state-owned energy company, ENI, has recently signed a large long-term contract with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Italy. In modern times, Russia has continued to have a privileged relationship with Italy. The Silvio Berlusconi Governments (2001‚Äì2006 and 2008-2011) strengthened Italy's ties with Russia, due to his personal friendship with President Vladimir Putin. Cooperation extends also to the aviation sector, between Italy's Alenia and Russia's Sukhoi, who are jointly developing a new aircraft. Russians have always visited Italy in great numbers. In 2017 United Russia, the party of Vladimir Putin, signed a deal with the Northern League, strengthening their political cooperation. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the PD party, suggested that Russian-backed organizations may have been promulgating fake news in Italy in order to influence electoral outcomes, and accused the Five Stars Movement to spread information supportive of the Russian government and its foreign policy.

The village lies 3 minutes away by car or around 30 minutes by foot via the B3215. In 2018/19 it was the least used station in Devon and in the South West and the tenth least used station in Great Britain.  History  The station in October 1969 The station was originally opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) as Okehampton Road when it formed the terminus and it was renamed as Belstone Corner when the line was extended to Okehampton in 1871,Southern Region Record by R.H.Clark and later renamed again as Sampford Courtenay.Nock, O. S. (1965) The London & South Western Railway. Pub. Ian Allan. London. P. 48. Services on the line were extended further west to Lydford railway station with the inauguration of Meldon Viaduct in 1874. Constructed to rival the South Devon Railway route to Plymouth, the completion of the LSWR's own route to Plymouth saw this line become an important route with lines to Padstow and Bude as well as Plymouth. Boat trains carrying passengers from ocean liners calling at Stonehouse Pool, Plymouth and prestige services such as the Atlantic Coast Express and Devon Belle all used the route. Sampford Courtenay in 1970 Following publication of the Beeching Report in 1963, the Exeter to Plymouth Line was cut back to Okehampton in 1968. , North Tawton, Sampford Courtenay and Okehampton lost their passenger services from 1972. The line survived, however, for the purposes of freight thanks to the activities of the British Rail ballast quarry at Meldon, three miles from Okehampton, which had an output of 300,000 tons per year. The quarry is not at present in operation and no freight originates from it. The quarry site is owned by Aggregate Industries. The station name is sometimes given as Sampford Courtney, but it is unclear as to whether it was ever officially spelt this way.  Reopening  The Dartmoor Railway reopened the former up side platform at the station in 2002. The Exeter to Okehampton service, known to many as the 'Sunday Rover', is operated by Great Western Railway, thanks to financial support from Devon County Council . Four return services are operated by Great Western Railway from Exeter and all serve Sampford Courtenay. These trains are timetabled to link in with Dartmoor Rover bus services and Dartmoor Railway services at Okehampton. Occasional heritage passenger services operate from the station, running to Okehampton and Meldon Quarry.Dartmoor Railway, News & Events. Train services were suspended after the last train on Sunday 8th September 2019.  Future options The Dartmoor Railway proposes to restore the interchange at Yeoford Junction where its line meets Great Western Railway's Tarka Line.

Captain Midlands was created by writer Paul Cornell and first penciled by Trevor Hairsine and first appeared in Wisdom #1 (January 2007). Characterization Captain Midlands is a patriotic British war veteran and a right-wing analogue of Captain America. An eighty-year-old BrummieMI 13: Meet Captain Midlands, Marvel.com, September 24, 2008 superhero, Captain Midlands is often portrayed as a grumpy old git. His real name, \\"Rambling\\" Sid Ridley, is a combination of Kenneth Williams' Round the Horne character ‚ÄòRambling Sid Rumpo‚Äô and Arnold Ridley who played Private Godfrey in the sitcom Dad's Army. Captain Midlands' nuanced role sees him more as a down-to-earth hero, with Paul Cornell describing him as: Fictional character biography As part of the 1940s British Super-Soldier program, Sid Ridley is transformed into a \\"perfect\\" specimen of human development and conditioning then sent off to be part of the British Army's war effort. After serving as Captain Midlands in World War II, Ridley somehow ended up in British Intelligence and eventually MI-13. Ridley also suggested that he had \\"knocked a girl up\\" (got her pregnant) and married her before she died in 1963. Captain Midlands served alongside other British heroes, including Captain Britain and Pete Wisdom in MI-13, fighting supernatural threats such as fairies, Y Ddraig Goch, alternate reality Jack the Rippers and Martians. He was also reported to be fighting the Skrull invasion of Britain. When MI:13 refocused itself against a supernatural pandemic, Captain Midlands - while carrying out routine crimefighting - identified a demonic incursion in Birmingham and called it in to the agency. He was captured and imprisoned in a council estate basement, being tempted to give his soul for an unknown desire. He was freed by and joined Pete Wisdom's strike team. However, this was a ploy by Captain Midlands to lead the group into a trap so he could get his heart's desire, to spend eternity with his dead wife. Wisdom, disgusted with Sid's treachery, deliberately destroyed the illusion of Sid's dead wife. After the team escaped, he was arrested in view of the public and imprisoned in The Vault, a high security prison in Shoreditch. In an act of mercy, Wisdom gave Sid the chance to kill himself and avoid humiliation in a trial - although it was left ambiguous as to which option Ridley took. Abilities and equipment Captain Midlands has no superhuman powers, although as a result of the 1940s British Super-Soldier program Sid Ridley was transformed into a \\"perfect\\" specimen of human development and conditioning. Captain Midlands' strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance are at the highest limits of natural human potential, and despite being an eighty-year- old man he still has a body of a superhero. Captain Midlands wears full DPM military fatigues and helmet with a cowl mask (similar to the World War II Ultimate Captain America outfit) and wields a golden circular shield in the design of the traditional lion symbol of Britain and coated in an anti-magic nanominium gloss.

The incident The incident took place on October 12, 1995, the same day of the national holiday in which Our Lady of Aparecida, the patron saint of Brazil, is celebrated.Epstein, Jack (1995-11-24). \\"Kicking of icon outrages Brazil Catholics\\" . The Dallas Morning News. Retrieved on January 6, 2009. That dawn, on O Despertar da F√© (), a national live television program by UCKG broadcast on Rede Record (owned by the same church), televangelist bishop S√©rgio Von Helder was expressing his thoughts about his church's teachings on \\"imagery\\" and \\"idolatry\\" on the saint's day, when an actual icon of the saint was shown. Then, as he walked around the image, talking about its inability \\"to see\\" and \\"to hear\\", he started to kick the image, proclaiming its \\"inability to react, because it's made of clay\\". On the following day, Rede Globo's Jornal Nacional denounced the incident, causing a nationwide commotion. The event was perceived by Catholics as a major act of religious intolerance, causing a public outcry. Several temples of the UCKG were a target of protests, and Von Helder had to be transferred to South Africa until the end of the controversy. =Network rivalry= Some see the incident as another clash between Rede Record and Rede Globo. A few months prior to the incident, Globo had broadcast a mini-series by Dias Gomes titled Decad√™ncia (), which depicted the fictional tale of Mariel Batista (Edson Celulari), a corrupt Protestant pastor. According to a Rede Record documentary about the imprisonment of Edir Macedo (UCKG founder and Record owner), some lines of the character were based on public speeches by him. Reaction Pope John Paul II urged Catholics not to \\"answer evil with evil\\". Dom Eug√™nio de Ara√∫jo Sales, then Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, said that \\"unless we control our emotions, there is the risk of a holy war. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, when questioned about the incident, said that \\"Brazil is a democratic country known by its tolerance\\" and that \\"any demonstration of intolerance hurts its unison spirit as well as its Christian spirit\\". Cultural references The \\"kicking of the saint\\" episode is referenced in the 1997 song \\"Guerra Santa\\" (), written and performed by Gilberto Gil.

Several Mull 34's have been built to the Swampfire design: New Orleans Marine built Swampfire in 1974 using Bill Seemann's C-Flex system. Swampfire went on to win every race in the 1974 ¬æ-ton world championships, establishing C-Flex as the material of choice for amateurs building one-off sailboat hulls.Composites Manufacturing, August 2006, p. 25Noyc.Org A Michigan family built Soma 3 in 1978 for racing on the Great Lakes, and she carries the Detroit River Yacht-racing Association sail number of 25777.Soma/Maria Keelboat Manual (http://144.92.9.188/hoofers/sailing/keelboats/kb_manual/kb_manual.html) The family donated Soma 3 to the Hoofer Sailing Club in 1989.

(although rejected by AristotleAristotle understood sight correctly, as depending on light: On Sense and the Sensible 1.3; On the Soul 418b-419a.), an eye beam generated in the eye was thought to be responsible for the sense of sight. The eye beam darted by the imagined basilisk, for instance, was the agent of its lethal power, given the technical term extramission. Constantine the Great (Capitoline Museums) The exaggerated eyes of fourth-century Roman emperors like Constantine the Great (illustration) reflect this character.L. Safran, \\"What Constantine saw: reflections on the Capitoline Colossus, visuality and early Christian studies\\" Millennium 3' (2006:43-73), noted in Paul Stephenson, Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor, 2010: notes 333. The concept found expression in poetry into the 17th century, most famously in John Donne's poem \\"The Extasie\\": > Our eye-beams twisted, and did thred Our eyes, upon one double string; So > to'entergraft our hands, as yet Was all the meanes to make us one, And > pictures in our eyes to get Was all our propagation. In the same period John Milton wrote, of having gone blind, \\"When I consider how my light is spent\\", meaning that he had lost the capacity to generate eye beams. Later in the century, Newtonian optics and increased understanding of the structure of the eye rendered the old concept invalid, but it was revived as an aspect of monstrous superhuman capabilities in popular culture of the 20th century. The emission theory of sight seemed to be corroborated by geometry and was reinforced by Robert Grosseteste.B.S. Eastwood, \\"Mediaeval Empiricism: The Case of Grosseteste's Optics\\" Speculum: A Journal of Mediaeval Studies, 1968. In Algernon Swinburne's \\"Atalanta in Calydon\\" the conception is revived for poetic purposes, enriching the poem's pagan context in the Huntsman's invocation of Artemis: > Hear now and help, and lift no violent hand, But favourable and fair as > thine eye's beam, Hidden and shown in heaven\\". In T.S. Eliot's rose garden episode that introduces \\"Burnt Norton\\" eyebeams persist in the fusion of possible pasts and presents like unheard music: > The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery And the unseen eyebeam crossed, > for the roses Had the look of flowers that are looked at. The New Zealand poet Edward Tregear instanced \\"the lurid eye-beam of the angry Bull\\"‚Äî Taurus of the zodiac‚Äî among the familiar stars above the alien wilderness of New Zealand.Quoted in K. R. Howe, \\"The Dating of Edward Tregear's 'Te Whetu Plains', and an Unpublished Companion Poem\\" Journal of New Zealand Literature 5 (1987:55-60) p. 58.

The protocol was originally proprietary, but was later opened up and is now published as RFC 7016 Operation By using RTMFP, applications that rely on live, real‚Äêtime communications, such as social networking services and multi‚Äêuser games will be able to deliver higher quality communication solutions. RTMFP enables end‚Äêusers to connect and communicate directly with each other using their computer‚Äôs microphone and webcam. This solution enhances the current functionality in the Flash Player by creating a higher quality solution that will perform better regardless of variations in the network. RTMFP is a peer- to-peer system, but is only designed for direct end user to end user communication for real-time communication, not for file sharing between multiple peers using segmented downloading.RTMFP FAQ Facebook uses this protocol in its Pipe applicationhttp://www.pipe.com/how/ to transfer big files directly between two users. Benefits RTMFP will reduce the bandwidth costs for direct, live, real‚Äêtime communication solutions, such as audio and video chat and multi‚Äêplayer games. Because RTMFP flows data between the end‚Äêuser clients and not the server, bandwidth is not being used at the server so solutions are less expensive to scale. RTMFP also increases the speed of delivery through the use of UDP. UDP is a more efficient (but less reliable) way to send video and audio data over the Internet that reduces the penalties associated with missing, dropped, or out of order packets. RTMFP has two features that may help to mitigate the effects of connection errors. Rapid Connection Restore: Connections are re‚Äêestablished quickly after brief outages. For example, when a wireless network connection experiences a dropout. After reconnection, the connection has full capabilities instantly. IP Mobility: Active network peer sessions are maintained even if a client changes to a new IP address. For example, when a laptop on a wireless network is plugged into a wired connection and receives a new address. Difference between RTMP and RTMFP The principal difference is how the protocols communicate over the network. RTMFP is based on User Datagram Protocol (UDP), whereas Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). UDP‚Äêbased protocols have some specific advantages over TCP‚Äêbased protocols when delivering live streaming media, such as decreased latency and overhead, and greater tolerance for dropped or missing packets, at the cost of decreased reliability. Unlike RTMP, RTMFP also supports sending data directly from one Adobe Flash Player to another, without going through a server. A server‚Äêside connection will always be required to establish the initial connection between the end‚Äêusers and can be used to provide server‚Äêside data execution or gateways into other systems. The user of a Flash Media Server will also be required to authorize network address lookup and NAT traversal services for the clients to prevent Flash Player from being used in an unmanaged way.  Application-level multicast  Flash Player 10.0 allowed only one-to-one communication for P2P, but from 10.1 application-level multicast is allowed.

During the Second World War, the Soviet army took over Hungary, and in 1948 Moscow took full control of the country. It became part of the Warsaw Pact, designed as a military alliance against NATO. The relations between both countries were damaged in 1956 due to the Soviet military intervention in the revolution occurring in Hungary. Hungary expelled its communist government in 1989, and diplomatic relations with Russia were restored after the breakup of the USSR in 1991. Hungary has an embassy in Moscow and two consulate-generals (in Saint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg). Russia has an embassy in Budapest and a consulate-general in Debrecen. Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. History =Hungary and Imperial Russia to 1917= The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 under Lajos Kossuth gained strong support across Hungary from 1848‚Äì1849. The young Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph appealed to Tsar Nicholas I for aid. He sent a large force that had been based in nearby Poland and it suppressed the revolt. However the military intervention was unpopular among the ordinary soldiers and the liberal officers of the Russian army. It was sharply criticized by such democrats as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Chernyshevsky.W. Bruce Lincoln, Nicholas I: Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias (1989) pp 312‚Äì317 online.Ian Young, \\"The Russians in Hungary, 1849,\\" History Today (1957) 7#3 pp 237-242Kenneth W. Rock, \\"Schwarzenberg versus Nicholas I, Round One: The Negotiation of the Habsburg-Romanov Alliance against Hungary in 1849.\\" Austrian History Yearbook 6 (1970): 109-141. =Hungary and the Soviet Union= In World War II Hungary was an ally of Germany. When Germany declared war on Russia in 1941, Hungary tried to remain neutral. When the controversial bombing of Kassa occurred, the government quickly declared the state of war existed between Hungary and the USSR, without receiving the consent of the Parliament.Carlile A. Macartney, \\"Hungary's Declaration of War on the U.S.S.R. in 1941 in . Studies in Diplomatic History & Historiography in Honour of GP Gooch (1962), p153-168. The People's Republic of Hungary (Magyar N√©pk√∂zt√°rsas√°g) was the official state name of Hungary from 1949 to 1989 during its Communist period under the control of the Soviet Union. Following the Soviet occupation of Hungary after World War II, the Soviets set up a police system that persecuted all opposition through direct force and propaganda, hoping this would lead to a Communist victory in the elections of 1946 . Despite these efforts, the Hungarian Communist Party came in third place in the elections, prompting the Soviets to directly impose a puppet government the following year. The next few years were spent consolidating power, using the √ÅVH secret police to suppress political opposition through intimidation, false accusations, imprisonment and torture.UN General Assembly Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary (1957) The worst of the repression came under the rule of M√°ty√°s R√°kosi. At the height of his rule, R√°kosi developed a strong cult of personality. Dubbed the \\"bald murderer\\", R√°kosi imitated Stalinist political and economic programs, resulting in Hungary experiencing one of the harshest dictatorships in Europe.Granville, Johanna, The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956, Texas A&M; University Press, 2004. Gati, Charles, Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt, Stanford University Press, 2006 , page 9-12 He described himself as \\"Stalin's best Hungarian disciple\\"Sugar, Peter F., Peter Hanak and Tibor Frank, A History of Hungary, Indiana University Press, 1994, , page 375-77 and \\"Stalin's best pupil\\".Matthews, John P. C., Explosion: The Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Hippocrene Books, 2007, , page 93-4 After Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\" denouncing Stalin's cult of personality, R√°kosi was ultimately removed from power and replaced by the reformist Imre Nagy, who attempted to take Hungary out of the Soviet bloc. This led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which was brutally crushed by the Soviets. Following the crushing of the revolution, the Soviets instituted J√°nos K√°d√°r as the leader of Hungary. After an initial period of repressions against the revolutionaries, K√°d√°r implemented a more moderate form of communism, which he referred to as \\"Goulash Communism.\\" He would rule until 1988, when he was removed from power just before the \\"revolution\\" that ended Communism in Hungary. =Hungary and the Russian Federation= Since 1991, Hungarian- Russian relations have improved constantly. This improvement has increased in part due to the election of Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n in 2010 and the announcement of his foreign relations plan, the \\"Eastern Opening Policy.\\" Created in opposition to Hungary's Western coalitions such as the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations, the Eastern Opening plan heavily prioritized Russia as a viable ally, and efforts were taken to secure that tight relationship throughout 2013‚Äì2014. One major proof of this is the bilateral agreement signed by the two nations over the nuclear plant Paks in Hungary, which calls into the question the risk of Hungary becoming financially dependent on Russia for more than a few decades. Following the Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n rejected the Russian sanctions despite European Union pressure. This has led outside officials in the EU and NATO to accuse Hungary as a \\"Trojan Horse\\", acting ultimately in the interests of Russia. In 2017, Vladimir Putin visited Budapest to meet with Orb√°n to discuss bilateral ties. As a response to the reaction to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in the United Kingdom, in April 2018, one Hungarian embassy staffer was expelled from Russia.https://en.trend.az/world/russia/2882113.html In May 2019, concerned over the tightening relations between Hungary, Russia, and also China, the Trump administration hosted Orb√°n in D.C, raising criticism from the EU and UN.

History President Vladimir Putin with former King Albert II, and spouses, whilst on a state visit in Brussels in October 2001. High level contacts between Belgium and Russia began in the early 18th century, when Peter the Great visited the Southern Netherlands in 1717. Amongst towns he visited were Brussels and Spa. Peter left his mark in Spa, when he built an edifice with a portico over the main spring, which the locals renamed in his honour as Pouhon Pierre-le-Grand. Diplomatic relations were established between Belgium and the Russian Empire in 1853, when Mikhail Irineyevich Khreptovich was appointed as the first envoy of the Russian Empire in Brussels on 19 March 1853.

Bailey (March 24, 1928 - August 12, 2020) was a faithless elector, physician and ophthalmologist from Rocky Mount, North Carolina, who achieved notoriety during the 1968 U.S. presidential election when he became the 145th faithless elector in the history of the United States Electoral College. Career A Republican-pledged elector, Bailey cast his vote for American Independent Party presidential nominee George Wallace and his running-mate Curtis LeMay, instead of for Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, who had carried his state. Wallace and LeMay won elections in five states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi) with their 45 electoral votes and Bailey's vote gave them a total of 46 electoral votes. Bailey at first claimed that when he was chosen as an elector by state party convention he had not pledged to cast his votes for Nixon and Agnew. Bailey further claimed that since Wallace had won in the district he represented, he was obligated to cast his votes for Wallace and LeMay. He also claimed that he forgot all about it until a party official reminded him of his electoral duties. Bailey, a staunch conservative and a member of John Birch Society, later admitted that he did not vote for Nixon because the President-elect had announced his intention to appoint Henry Kissinger and Daniel Patrick Moynihan to government positions, and had asked Chief Justice Earl Warren to stay in office through the end of June 1969. Bailey stated that if altering his vote would have changed the outcome of the election he would not have done it, and that his vote for Wallace was simply a protest. He became known as a \\"protest elector\\". Due to Bailey's actions some members of Congress, most notably Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine (a defeated Democratic Vice Presidential nominee) and Representative James O'Hara of Michigan tried to invoke an 1887 statute under which both houses of the United States Congress may disqualify any vote by an elector that has not been \\"regularly given.\\" However, the motion was defeated. Bailey himself appeared at congressional hearings regarding this case. Bailey's actions prompted calls for reform of the system. Polls at the time showed that the vast majority of Americans, over 70%, would support replacing the Electoral College with popular, direct voting as advocated by Birch Bayh, or retaining electoral votes without electors themselves, as proposed by Hale Boggs.

The Czech Republic has an embassy in Moscow, and two consulates general (in Saint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg). The Russian Federation has an embassy in Prague, and two consulate generals (in Brno and Karlovy Vary).  History  During the entire medieval period and early modern period, the Czech lands, in the form of Duchy of Bohemia and Kingdom of Bohemia, were aligned with the Holy Roman Empire and later Austrian Empire. During the first half of the 20th century, Czech-Russian relations were formalized as Czechoslovakia‚ÄìSoviet Union relations. Czechoslovakia recognized the Soviet Union de jure in 1934. On May 16, 1935 the Czechoslovak‚ÄìSoviet Treaty of Alliance was signed between the two states as the consequence of Soviet alliance with France (which was Czechoslovakia's main ally).Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism of the CPCz CC, Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism of the CPS CC. An Outline of the History of the CPCz. Prague: Orbis Press Agency, 1980. p. 158. After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the establishment of the pro-German Slovak state in March 1939, The Soviet Union quickly recognized the new status quo and terminated diplomatic relations with Czech representatives. Shortly after the Munich Agreement, many Czechoslovak Communists gained asylum in the Soviet Union, however hundreds of non-communist refugees were sent to the labor camps. After World War II, when Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took over the control of the country through a Soviet-backed 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat, Czechoslovakia became part of the Eastern Bloc through Warsaw Pact with Soviet Union and eastern and central European socialist countries. On August 21, 1968 following the Prague Spring pro-democracy reforms of the Czech government, the Soviet-led invasion re-established the Communist regime by force. 108 Czechs and Slovaks died and approximately 500 were wounded as a direct result of the invasion. The invasion stopped the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from making democratic and liberal reforms, and politicians loyal to Moscow gained control again. This damaged relations between the two countries. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the independent Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, formally re-joined the political Western world after four decades of absence and re-aligned its foreign policy and economic interests with its Western allies.

Diplomatic relations between Denmark and the USSR were established on 18 June 1924. Russia has an embassy in Copenhagen and a consulate in T√≥rshavn, and Denmark has an embassy in Moscow, a Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg, and an honorary consulate in Kaliningrad. Both countries border the Baltic Sea and are members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe.  History  =Early Modern era= Amicable relations between the Kingdom of Denmark and the Muscovite state were based on a mutual assistance pact of 1493, renewed in 1506 and 1517. In 1562, the Danish king Frederick II and the Russian tsar Ivan IV continued amicable relations based on the Treaty of Mozhaysk. =18th century= Great Northern War During the Great Northern War, a coalition of various states successfully attacked the Swedish Empire in northern Central and Eastern Europe. Initially, the anti-Swedish alliance was composed of the Tsardom of Russia, Denmark- Norway, and Saxe-Poland-Lithuania. Frederik IV and August the Strong were forced out of the alliance in 1700 and 1706, respectively, but re-joined it in 1709. George I of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (Hanover) joined the coalition in 1714 for Hanover, and 1717 for Britain, and Frederick William I of Brandenburg- Prussia in 1715. On the Swedish side were Holstein-Gottorp (a Danish vassal), between 1704 and 1710 several Polish and Lithuanian magnates under Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, and between 1708 and 1710 cossacks under Ivan Mazepa. The Ottoman Empire temporarily hosted Charles XII of Sweden and intervened against Peter the Great. After fighting in various other theatres went against the Swedes, Sweden proper was invaded by Denmark-Norway from the west and by Russia from the east. Though the Danish attacks were repulsed, Russia managed to occupy Finland and inflict severe losses on the Swedish navy and coastal fortresses. Charles XII opened up a Norwegian front, but was killed in Fredriksten in 1718. The war ended with a defeat for Sweden, leaving Russia as the new major power in the Baltic Sea and a new important player in European politics ‚Äî in fact, it signed the beginning of a pattern of Russian expansion that would only be stopped two centuries later. Denmark gained little from Sweden in the peace settlement, but it was able to gain at the expense of its disloyal vassal in Holstein. Holstein-Gottorp Sweden's defeat in the Great Northern War ended its patronage for Holstein-Gottorp, and Denmark used the occasion to seize Gottorp's territory in Schleswig. The frustrated Duke of Holstein-Gottorp sought support for the recovery of Schleswig in Russia and married into the Russian imperial family in 1725. Russian Empress Elizabeth died childless in 1762, and she appointed her nephew, the Duke of Holstein- Gottorp, to be her successor in Russia. When he ascended the throne as Tsar Peter III of Russia, Holstein-Gottorp came to be ruled in personal union by the Emperor of Russia, creating a conflict of territorial claims between Russia and Denmark. Peter III threatened war with Denmark for the recovery of his ancestral lands, but before any fighting could begin he was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Tsarina Catherine II. Empress Catherine reversed Russia's stance, withdrawing her husband's ultimatum and even entering an alliance with Denmark in 1765. In the 1760s the two governments negotiated the transfer of ducal Schleswig-Holstein to the Danish crown in return for Russian control of the County of Oldenburg and adjacent lands within the Holy Roman Empire, an exchange that was formalized with the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo. The alliance that accompanied the territorial exchange tied Denmark's foreign policy to Russia's and led directly to Denmark's involvement in a series of wars over the succeeding decades. Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì1790) When Sweden attacked Russia in 1788, Denmark upheld its treaty obligations to Russia and declared war on Sweden. A Norwegian army briefly invaded Sweden and won the Battle of Kvistrum Bridge, before peace was signed on 9 July 1789 following the diplomatic intervention of Great Britain and Prussia. Under their pressure, Denmark-Norway declared itself neutral in the Russo-Swedish conflict, bringing this war to an end. =19th century= French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars During the French Revolutionary Wars, Denmark and Russia were allies in the Second League of Armed Neutrality in resisting the British Royal Navy's wartime policy of searching neutral shipping for French contraband, which led to the British Navy's attack on Denmark at the 1801 Battle of Copenhagen. During the subsequent Napoleonic Wars Russia and Denmark were members of Napoleon's Continental System, which led the British to launch another naval attack on Copenhagen in 1807. This bombardment began the Anglo-Russian War (1807‚Äì12) and drew Denmark into the Napoleonic conflicts in the Dano-Swedish War of 1808‚Äì09, in which both Russia and Denmark fought on France's side. However, Napoleon's disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia pushed Russia to the opposing, British-led side in the War of the Sixth Coalition, while Denmark remained a French client. When France was eventually defeated by the Sixth Coalition, Denmark was forced to cede control of Norway to Sweden in the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, accelerating Denmark's decline as a major power in Europe. Schleswig Wars As German nationalism rose in the mid-1800s, the Schleswig-Holstein Question came to dominate Denmark's foreign affairs. After the First Schleswig War Russia took Denmark's side in the negotiation of the 1852 London Protocol, which reaffirmed Danish sovereignty in the disputed duchies. Russia also offered diplomatic support for Denmark in the Second Schleswig War but did not make a military intervention, and Denmark ultimately lost Schleswig-Holstein in its entirety to Prussia in the 1864 Treaty of Vienna. Empress Maria Feodorovna In 1866 Danish Princess Dagmar, a daughter of King Frederick VIII, married the future Tsar Alexander III of Russia, taking the Russian name Maria Feodorovna. She was a popular empress and became the mother of Russia's last Tsar, Nicholas II. As Russian Empress, she donated funds for the construction of a Russian Orthodox Church in Copenhagen as a gift to the Orthodox community in Denmark. In September 2006 her remains were transferred from Denmark to St. Petersburg to be interred beside her husband. =20th century= Soviet Union After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Denmark recognized the Soviet Union and established diplomatic relations in 1924. Though the Danish government sought to remain neutral in both World Wars, the country was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940 and joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941 (though it insisted upon its neutrality in any conflict with Russia). Denmark also never recognized the Soviet Union's annexation of the Baltic Republics as legitimate. After World War II ended Denmark became a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949, though its foreign policy continued to incline more toward neutrality than confrontation with the Soviet Union. Present Today, both countries are close trading partners, and trade mainly along the Baltic coast. The Faroe Islands was the only Danish overseas territory that decided to negotiate a free trade agreement with Russia.Faroe Islands negotiate free trade agreement with Russia The trade will go through Denmark, and then to Russia. There are also some Russian fishermen visiting T√≥rshavn, the capital of the islands. On 27 May 2008 Russia and Denmark signed visa agreements.Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Government of the Russian Federation on the facilitation of the issuance of visas to the citizens of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Russian Federation. Per Stig M√∏ller, then Foreign Minister of Denmark, stated that the agreements will help to ease contacts between scientists, businessmen and students of the two countries. The deal was also an inline agreement between Russia and the European Union. In August 2014, the Danish government announced that it would contribute to NATO's missile defense shield by equipping one or more of its frigates with radar capacity, amid the Ukrainian crisis and growing tensions between Russia and NATO. On 22 March 2015, the Russian ambassador to Denmark, Mikhail Vanin, confirmed the tensions during an interview to Jyllands-Posten: \\"I do not think Danes fully understand the consequences of what happens if Denmark joins the US-led missile defense. If this happens, Danish warships become targets for Russian nuclear missiles\\". Denmark's foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, announced the ambassador's remarks as unacceptable and that the defense system was not aimed at Russia, a claim echoed by NATO's spokeswoman, Oana Lungescu. NATO's spokesman added that the Russian statements \\"do not inspire confidence or contribute to predictability, peace or stability\\".

Along with saeu-jeot (salted shrimps), it is one of the most commonly consumed jeotgal in Korean cuisine. In mainland Korea, myeolchi-jeot is primarily used to make kimchi, while in Jeju Island, meljeot (; myeolchi-jeot in Jeju language) is also used as a dipping sauce. The Chuja Islands, located between South Jeolla and Jeju, are famous for producing the highest quality myeolchi-jeot.  Names and etymology  Myeolchi-jeot () is a compound of myeolchi (), the Korean word for anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), and jeot (), the word meaning salted fermented seafood. Meljeot () is also a compound, consisting of mel (), the Jeju name for anchovy, and jeot. The Jeju word mel is cognate with the first syllable myeol of the Korean word myeolchi, whose second syllable -chi is a suffix attached to fish names. Similar forms to meljeot also occur in mainland Korean dialects, including metjeot () and mitjeot () in Gyeongsang dialect.  Preparation  The anchovies for Myeolchi-jeot are harvested along the southern coasts of the Korean Peninsula en masse. Myeolchi-jeot used in the process called gimjang are prepared with mature anchovies known as osari- myeolchi (flood tide anchovies), which are harvested in July and August. On Jeju Island, bigger anchovies harvested in the spring along the coasts of Seogwipo are made into meljeot. Cleaned fresh anchovies are drained on sokuri (bamboo baskets), and salted with coarse salt weighing 15‚Äí20% of the anchovies. In an onggi (earthenware jar), the anchovies and salt are put in layers, with the uppermost layer being a thick layer of salt, to prevent the anchovies from coming in contact with the air. The jar is sealed, and the salted anchovies are then allowed to ferment at for two to three months in onggi (earthenware jars). Once the myeolchi-jeot has aged another couple of months, it becomes myeolchi-jeot-guk (anchovy extract).  Culinary use  Meljeot (salted anchovies) as a dipping sauce for grilled ogyeopsal (pork belly)The liquid extract, made after around six months of fermentation of myeolchi-jeot, is filtered and boiled to be used in kimchi. Alternatively, two parts myeolchi-jeot can be mixed with one part water, boiled over high heat, filtered, let set, and the upper, clear layer is used in kimchi. The boiled and filtered myeolchi-jeot liquid may also used to flavor seaweed dishes. Myeolchi-jeot made with boned anchovies are seasoned and eaten as banchan (side dish). In Geomun Island, where it is difficult to grow soybeans, the remaining solids and cloudy lower layer of liquid after extracting the clear, upper liquid (anchovy extract) from myeolchi-jeot is used to make myeoljang (anchovy paste). In Jeju Island, meljeot is used as dipping sauce for grilled pork. In summer, meljeot is used in blanched soybean leaf ssam (wrap), and in winter, napa cabbage leaves are dipped in meljeot. Meljeot may also be eaten as banchan (side dish), either as is or seasoned with garlic and chili peppers.
