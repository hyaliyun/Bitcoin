It is rare and endangered in the wild, where it is found near Mesa de Le√≥n in the state of Quer√©taro, and in the state of Hidalgo.IUCN: Echinocactus grusonii . accessed 6.3-.2013 The population was critically reduced in the 1990s, by the creation of the Zimap√°n Dam and reservoir in Hidalgo. The cactus grows in volcanic rock on slopes, at altitudes around . Taxonomy Echinocactus grusonii belongs to the small genus Echinocactus, which together with the related genus Ferocactus, are commonly referred to as barrel cacti. The species was first described by German plantsman Heinrich Hildmann in 1891. While sometimes referred to as golden ball, this species is not to be confused with Notocactus leninghausii which have fuzzy, harmless spines and are native to Brazil and Paraguay. Description Growing as a large roughly spherical globe, Echinocactus grusonii may eventually reach over in height after many years. Younger Golden Barrel plants do not look similar to mature specimens. The generation lifetime is estimated to be 30 years. There may be up to 35 pronounced ribs in mature plants, though they are not evident in young plants, which may have a knobbly appearance. The sharp spines are long, straight or slightly curved, and various shades of yellow or, occasionally, white. Small yellow flowers appear in summer around the crown of the plant, but only after twenty years or so. Cultivation Golden barrel cacti at the Huntington Echinocactus grusonii is widely cultivated by specialty plant nurseries as an ornamental plant, for planting in containers, desert habitat gardens, rock gardens, and in conservatories. . accessed 6.30.2013 A white-spined form, and a short-spined form, are also in cultivation. It is one of the most popular cacti in cultivation and has increasingly become popular as an architectural accent plant in contemporary garden designs. The cactus is considered easy and relatively fast growing in warmer climates around the world. The plants do have some basic requirements; an average minimum winter temperature of 12 ¬∞C (53.6 ¬∞F); and good drainage with less watering in winter. Excess water in cool periods may lead to rot. Golden Barrels are hardy to about ‚àí8 ¬∞C (15 ¬∞F) for brief periods. Beyond Central Mexico, Echinocactus grusonii specimens may also be seen in collections of desert plants in many botanical gardens. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

For the majority of his life he was one of a small group committed to the art and practice of structuring urban growth in the first half of the century. His projects ranged from Vancouver, B.C. to St John's, Newfoundland, from the smallest scale details of garden design to a study of the nation's capital.  Chronological events  Frederick G. Todd was born March 11, 1876 in Concord, New Hampshire. He attended the agricultural college in Amherst, Massachusetts where he studied botany, biology, agriculture and site engineering. After completing school in 1896 be became an apprentice as a landscape architect with the firm of Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot, in Brookline, Massachusetts until he moved to Montreal in 1900. During Todd's time in Montreal he established the first resident practices of landscape architecture in Canada. In 1903 Todd prepared a comprehensive report on the future growth of the nation's capital for the Ottawa Improvement Commission. Between 1904 and 1907 Todd prepared and executed the plans for Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg and Wascana Park in Regina, and developed a prototype for future garden cities. In 1905 he became a fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Between 1907 and 1912 Frederick designed three major garden city projects in British Columbia; Shaughnessy Heights and Point Grey in Vancouver, and Port Mann on the Fraser River. From 1913 to 1918 he designed and supervised major urban parks in Quebec City and Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland as well as developed the model city plan for the town of Mount Royal Montreal. Todd also worked as a consultant for Alcan and designed a number of private gardens and institutional grounds as well as urban parks for smaller urban communities between 1918 and 1930. From 1930 to 1940 he designed and supervised major public works projects in Quebec during the depression including St. Helen's Island (1936), Beaver Lake in Mount Royal Park (1939) and developed a proposal for an impressive sports centre for the British Empire and Olympic games in Maisonneuve Park, Montreal (1938). In 1939, Todd was elected president of the Quebec Horticultural Society. In 1945, he was appointed vice-president of the City Improvement League, Montreal. Between 1945 and 1948 he initiated plans and supervised construction of the Garden of the Way of the Cross adjacent to St. Joseph's Oratory. On February 15, 1948 he died in Montreal at the age of 71.  Design Projects  While working under Frederick Law Olmsted's firm, Todd helped with the design plan for Mount Royal along with many houses designed by William Sutherland Maxwell and Edward Maxwell. It is said that when Frederick Todd began working on his own that his \\"influence on his home city of Montreal was profound\\" which included many works created for private or public along with individuals and groups. Some of his works in Montreal included, St. Helene Island Parks, or otherwise known as Ile de Ste. Helene , some work on Mount Royal Mountain, Memorial Cemetery , and the Garden of the Way of the Cross. Todd was also the designer for some other public spaces, for example:Plains of Abraham and the National Capital, which was the Ottawa Improvement Commission Report (Cultivating,1), Shaughnessy Heights , Bowring Park, and some design plans for Trinity College in Toronto. Todd also worked on a number of smaller projects, including some residences and works for other cities within Canada. Todd was involved in a number of organizations including the Civic Improvement League, the Olmsted Legacy, the director of the Parks and Playgrounds Association , the Community Garden League of Montreal, and finally the councilor of the Montreal Municipal Council. He was very active and \\"devoted much time and energy to a variety of civic institutions and was a fellow of three professional organizations: the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects and the Town Planning Institute of Canada\\" (Todd, 1).  Importance  Frederick G. Todd is an influential and important figure in history for a few reasons. Although he is not a well known landscape architect, even in Canada, he created many spaces that still remain today. He was considered a \\"modest man whose work and ideals are little known,\\" however he is responsible for much of Canada's beauty and usefulness (Todd, 1). Todd worked on many improvement plans for the communities that also made him very influential to most of North America. He created many designs that dealt with \\"parks, open spaces, public institutions, roadways, and neighborhoods,\\" some of which were donations and gifts to the communities (CSLA, 1). One of the most defining points of Frederick Todd as a designer was how he \\"popularized naturalistic landscape designs and the idea of a ‚Äònecklace of parks‚Äô as linked open spaces- a concept still used today\\" (OALA, 1). Many people respect Canadian landscape architects for three main features that most exhibit in their professional practices; creativity, sensitivity, and practicality. Todd was a person that, although not widely known, was considered \\"one of the great landscape architects and urban planners in Canada at the end of the 19th Century\\" who had created a respectable image as a designer that will remain prominent in Canadian history over time.

History The highway was originally designated on August 4, 1932 from Hondo southeast to Devine. On October 26, 1932, it extended southeast to Pleasanton. On January 11, 1933, it was rerouted to end in Jourdanton. On October 16, 1933, this section from Devine to Jourdanton was cancelled. On May 14, 1935, it extended back to Jourdanton. On July 15, 1935, SH 173 was cancelled. On September 3, 1935, a road from Devine to Jourdanton was being investigated for preparation for restoration of this section of SH 173. On April 20, 1936, the entire route was restored. On September 26, 1939, the designated route was extended south from Jourdanton through Freer, absorbing most of SH 241, with an expected terminus at Hebbronville. on January 29, 1942, the section from Freer to Hebbronville had been cancelled. On August 31, 1965, the section south of Jourdanton was transferred to SH 16. On February 21, 1972, SH 173 was signed, but not designated along FM 689 to Kerrville. On October 23, 1978, the section west of Loop 534 was transferred to Loop 534, but still signed as SH 173.. On August 29, 1990, the route was extended northward to Kerrville, replacing FM 689. Route description SH 173 begins at SH 16 just north of Jourdanton. SH 173 runs northwest toward Devine where it intersects I-35 in the south part of town. Leaving Devine, 173 turns running in a sharper northwest direction. Just east of Hondo, the highway interchanges with US 90. The highway turns to run in a more north-south direction, twisting and turning many times through canyons. SH 173 enters Bandera and intersects SH 16 for a second time. The two highways share a short overlap before splitting. Here, signs are posted advising trucks and through traffic to use SH 173 as a route to Kerrville instead of SH 16, as SH 173 is a shorter and faster route, while SH 16 traverses a hill with many sharp curves. SH 173 intersects SH 16 for a third time in Kerrville, where the highway ends.

A founding father of the Jesuit China missions, co-author of the first European‚ÄìChinese dictionary, and first European translator of the Four Books of Confucianism, he has been described as the first European sinologist. Life =Early life= Pompilio Ruggieri was born in Spinazzola, Apulia, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, in 1543. He obtained a doctorate in civil and canon law () at the University of Naples and was employed in the administration of Philip II. He entered the Society of Jesus in Rome on 27 October 1572 taking the name \\"Michele\\". After completing the Jesuit usual spiritual and intellectual formation, Ruggieri volunteered for the Asian missions and left for Lisbon, where he was ordained in March 1578 while waiting for a ship to take him to Goa. =Missionary work= A page from the manuscript Portuguese-Chinese dictionary created by Ruggieri, Ricci, and Fernandez (between 1583-88) Ruggieri left Europe with a group of missionaries which included Rudolph Acquaviva and Matteo Ricci. Arriving in India (September 1578), he promptly started to study the language used on the Malabar coast and in 6 months reached such proficiency that he could hear confession. It is probably this gift for language that made him an ideal choice for the beginning of the Chinese mission. Ruggieri was assigned to Macau to study the Chinese language and customs, arriving 20 July 1579. He landed at the Portuguese trade centre and started at once to learn to read and write Chinese. In the process, and aware that several will be following him, he set up Shengma'erding Jingyuan (\\"St Martin House\\"), the first school for teaching Chinese to foreigners. Ruggieri's and Ricci's intent was to settle somewhere in \\"real\\" China - not just Macao, and to that end Ruggieri made a number of trips to Canton (Guangzhou) and Zhaoqing (the residence of the Governor General of Guangdong and Guangxi), making useful contacts with the local authorities. As such he is one of the first Christian missionaries to have entered Ming Dynasty Mainland China. After a number of failed attempts to obtain permission to establish a permanent mission within China, such a permission was finally obtained in 1582, and in 1583 Ricci and Ruggieri finally settled in Zhaoqing, the first stage on the Jesuits' \\"long ascent\\" to Beijing. Biography at the Ricci 21st Century Roundtable database. In 1584 Ruggieri published the first Chinese catechism. Visiting villages in the region he baptized several families that formed the nucleus of further Christian communities in mainland China. During 1583-88, Michele Ruggieri, with Matteo Ricci as co-author, created a Portuguese-Chinese dictionary - the first ever European-Chinese dictionary, for which they developed a consistent system for transcribing Chinese words in Latin alphabet. The dictionary's Romanisation was Ruggieri's. A Chinese Jesuit Lay Brother Sebastiano Fernandez, who had grown up and been trained in Macau, assisted in this work. Unfortunately, the manuscript was misplaced in the Jesuit Archives in Rome, and re-discovered only in 1934, by Pasquale d'Elia. This dictionary was finally published in 2001.Yves Camus, \\"Jesuits‚Äô Journeys in Chinese Studies\\" \\"Dicion√°rio Portugu√™s-Chin√™s : Pu Han ci dian : Portuguese-Chinese dictionary\\", by Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci; edited by John W. Witek. Published 2001, Biblioteca Nacional. . Partial preview available on Google Books To Ruggieri is attributed one of the first collections of handwritten maps of China, translated into Latin from Chinese sources (atlases and maps), dating back to 1606, or nearly fifty years before the manuscript maps of the Polish Jesuit Michael Boym and the Novus Atlas Sinensis of the Trentino Jesuit Martino Martini (printed by the publisher Johan Blaeu in Amsterdam in 1655 and immediately translated into several languages). The manuscript is now preserved in the State Archives of Rome, ms. 493. Ruggieri was accused by Cai Yilong (wTs‚Äòai I-lung) of adultery with the wife of Lo Hung in October 1587. After trial, the judge ordered Cai to be severely punished, to the point he died of his wounds. =Return to Europe= In November 1588, Ruggieri left China for Rome in order to get the pope to send an embassy to the Wanli Emperor. This plan had been proposed as a means to allow Jesuits to reach Beijing and to be received by the emperor. But nothing became of it, the frequent death of Roman Pontiffs, and the deterioration of his own health, preceded the weary Jesuit's retirement to Salerno, where he died in 1607 without ever going to China again.Matteo Ricci, Nicolas Trigault. De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu, Book Two, Chapter 12, \\"Father Ruggieri goes to Rome to arrange for an embassy from the Pope...\\".

The original Latin text can be found on Google Books. In Salerno, the retired Jesuit carried on intellectual work that would make China better known in Europe. He completed the Latin translation of the Four Books (the classic Chinese introduction to Confucius‚Äô philosophy), wrote poetry in Chinese, and circulated copies of Chinese maps he had brought along with him from Zhaoqing. Ruggieri was also a much sought after spiritual guide and confessor in the school of Salerno. He died on 11 May 1607.

Originally a London watchmaker, Solomon was appointed as Chief Constable ‚Äî the highest rank in the force ‚Äî on 18 May 1838, which was a notable appointment in that period as he was a Jewish man. He became the superior officer to two superintendents, three inspectors, twenty-four constables and a night constable ‚Äî a total of thirty-one officers for a population of around 47,000. While interviewing a prisoner ‚Äî 23-year-old John Lawrence, for theft of a roll of carpet ‚Äî on 13 March 1844, Solomon was bludgeoned by Lawrence with a poker, causing a head injury from which he later died. An appeal to which Queen Victoria gave ¬£50 () raised a large sum for the welfare of his widow and nine children. Lawrence was found guilty of murder at Lewes Assizes and publicly hanged at Horsham. Solomon is thought to be the only Chief Constable in the United Kingdom to have been murdered in his own police station. His ghost reputedly haunts the basement of the building, now a town hall. He is buried in the Florence Place Old Jewish Burial Ground in Brighton's Round Hill district,Sharman Kadish, Jewish Heritage in England : An Architectural Guide, English Heritage, 2006, p. 79 where he has been considered to be the 'celebrity' grave.

Biography Bassam Shakaa was a member of one of the most distinguished families in Nablus. He became a member of the Jordanian Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party in the early 1950s and as a consequence was wanted by Jordanian authorities, forcing him to flee to Syria. He was one of the fierce critics of Syria's independence from the United Arab Republic and after being jailed by the Syrian authorities following his resignation from the Ba'ath Party because of the 1966 split within the Ba'ath movement. Following his release, he moved to Egypt until amnesty from the Jordanian government when he moved back to his hometown of Nablus. In 1976 he was elected mayor of Nablus, a position he held until 1982, when all Palestinian mayors were replaced with Israeli local governors. Shakaa had been a Palestine Liberation Organisation supporter and outspoken critic of the Camp David accords, and was subsequently issued an expulsion order in 1979. Felicia Langer successfully defended him from the charges in the court, which was accompanied by large-scale popular actions consisting of demonstrations and the collective resignation of all West Bank mayors. On June 2, 1980 he was the victim of a bomb placed in his car by members of the Jewish Underground. They also planted bombs in the cars of Ibrahim Tawil, mayor of El-Bireh, and Karim Khalaf, mayor of Ramallah. Khalaf lost one leg, while Shakaa had to have both legs amputated. Moshe Zer, one of the first Israeli settlers in the northern West Bank, led the Jewish underground \\"hit team\\" that tried to assassinate Shakaa. Zer was convicted of causing grievous injury and belonging to a terror group, but was sentenced to only four months in prison, the time he was in jail awaiting trial, because of the state of his health and the fact that he was badly injured in an attempt of a Palestinian to murder him. The bomb was planted merely months after Ezer Weizman, then Israeli defence minister, threatened Shakaa with \\"physical harm\\" if he carried on with his resistance.[Source?] In the spring of 1982, the Israeli administration removed Shakaa as mayor and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three-and-a-half years.Middle East International No 270, 7 March 1986, Publishers Lord Mayhew, Dennis Walters. Daoud Kuttab p. 6 Following his mayorship, Shakaa remained a strong supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and continued his resistance against Israeli governance under occupation. The Oslo Accords were a blow to the resistance Shakaa and his contemporaries put up against Israeli governance during their time in mayorship and he was as outspoken against Oslo and the Palestinian Authority (PA) as he was against the agreement reached at Camp David in 1978. He remained a supporter of resistance, both violent and non- violent, against Israeli occupation and maintained his anti-normalization position, opposing negotiations with the occupation. In 1999, the Palestinian Authority put him under house arrest following \\"The 20 Declaration\\", which was signed by 20 anti-PA figures, criticizing the line the PA was going down and calling for an end to the Oslo Accords. In September 2011, Shakaa signed a petition of several Palestinian figures criticizing PA president Mahmoud Abbas' move to seek recognition of a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders at the United Nations as a distraction from the resistance that the Palestinian people must carry out and a move that could put Palestinian rights in danger. Shakaa was President of the pan-Arabist Party in Palestine (al- Tayyar al-Arabi al-Qawmi fi Falasteen). Former Nablus mayor Ghassan Shakaa and former Dutch member of parliament Arjan El Fassed are his nephews. Shakaa died on 22 July 2019 in Nablus, aged 89.

He was working for Radio France Internationale in Ivory Coast when he was killed in Abidjan by police Sergeant Th√©odore S√©ry Dago. Jean H√©l√®ne was his press name, Christian Baldensberger being his real name.  Controversial Journalism Earlier, Jean H√©l√®ne had served as the Le Monde correspondent in Rwanda. His coverage of the Rwandan genocide during this period was biased in favour of the Hutus. In particular, during the early months when thousands of civilians were butchered, he characterized the killings as those of enemy combatants. A French court ruling in May 1999 says: :Considering that an examination of the press cuttings entered into evidence shows that during the first two months of the conflict Le Monde, through its correspondent, Jean Helene, highlighted the \\"civil war\\" aspect of the conflict... Murder and Trial On 21 October 2003, in a prevailing atmosphere of rabid anti-French sentiment during the Civil war in C√¥te d'Ivoire, H√©l√®ne had gone to the Abidjan police headquarters to interview some government opponents who had just been released from detention. Apparently he had an altercation with Sergeant Dago over parking, following which Dago went inside, grabbed an AK-47 and shot him dead as he was walking from his car, talking on his mobile phone. Sergeant Dago was immediately arrested and apparently confessed to the crime. Subsequently however, he changed his position claiming that he had come inside the building after talking to Helene when he heard the shots that killed him. There was wide international condemnation of the event. Amnesty international said: :The fact that a sergeant can kill a journalist who posed no threat to him in cold blood shows the atmosphere of impunity in which C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire security forces have been operating. After the event, Th√©odore S√©ry Dago became a hero and a Dago support committee was formed. In January 2004, a military court under judge Ahmed Lanz√©ni Coulibaly considered ballistic evidence which indicated that the bullet had been shot from Dago's service weapon, and found him guilty of having \\"deliberately killed\\" Helene. Dago was sentenced to 17 years in prison.

Though funded and integrated into the New South Wales state public health system, it is operated by St Vincent's Health Australia. It is affiliated with the University of Tasmania College of Health and Medicine and the University of New South Wales Medical School. History =Foundation of initial hospital= St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital was established in 1857 by five Irish Sisters of Charity, who had migrated to Sydney in 1838 with a mission to help the poor and disadvantaged. Some of their early work included helping victims of the 1853 influenza outbreak and families of prisoners in the nearby Darlinghurst Gaol. Three of the hospital‚Äôs founding sisters had trained as professional nurses in France, and they brought their knowledge to the colony, establishing a hospital that was free to all people, but especially for the poor, on a non-sectarian basis.Anne- Maree Whitaker, St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital 1857‚Äì2007: 150 years of charity, care and compassion, Sydney, Kingsclear Books, 2007, pp. 2‚Äì3. =Foundation of present hospital= The present hospital was founded in the neighbouring suburb of Potts Point, on a site which is now St Vincent‚Äôs College. As demand grew, a new hospital with 150 beds was built on its present site in Victoria Street, Darlinghurst in 1870. The architect was Oswald Lewis. The building was remodelled and enlarged after World War I and is now known as the De Lacy Building, after one of the founding sisters.Whitaker, 2007, pp. 5, 13, 56‚Äì57. =Modern history= Forming part of the St Vincent's Local Hospital Network, the hospital is now a facility of St Vincent's Health Australia. The hospital was previously administered by the Sisters of Charity, who transferred ownership to St Vincent's Health Australia. St Vincent's Health Australia is a part of Mary Aikenhead Ministries. In 2006, building work commenced on Stage 1 of the St Vincent's Research and Biotechnology Precinct; a joint partnership between , the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. In 2008, building work commenced on a new facility within the grounds of St Vincent's that will encompass a mental health, drug and alcohol, and community health unit. St Vincent's has been forced to close beds in the past because of inadequate government funding, despite huge increases in the number of patients admitted in recent years. This resulted in further pressure at times, placed on Sydney's already over-stretched health care system, with subsequent increases in the number of patients on waiting lists for elective surgery, the time spent on those lists awaiting surgery; an increase in the time spent waiting to see a doctor in the Emergency Department, in the time spent awaiting transfer to a ward if admitted, and an increase in the number of days that ambulances need to be turned away because the Emergency Department is closed to all, but life-threatening only (LTO) admissions. The most recent example of this, prior to the closure of the HIV/AIDS ward, was January‚ÄìMarch, 2007, when an entire surgical ward was forced to close in order to cut costs, which in turn placed tremendous pressure on the rest of the hospital. Those beds have since been reopened. Services =Heart, lung and bone-marrow transplantation= St Vincent's is a leading medical, surgical and research facility. It has been at the forefront of innovation in areas such as heart, lung and bone marrow transplantation. The first Australian heart transplant was performed on 23 October 1968 by Harry Windsor on a 57-year-old, Richard Pye. The hospital was also the first Australian hospital to implement a successful cardiac transplant programme. The head of the transplant program was Windsor, but the surgeon who conducted the first successful transplant in 1982 was Victor Chang, a Chinese-Australian cardiothoracic surgeon. One of the first patients to receive a new heart at St Vincents was 14-year-old Fiona Coote who, on 7 April 1984, became Australia's youngest and first female heart transplant recipient at the time. Cardiothoracic surgeons performed the first heart/lung transplant. =HIV/AIDS and IV drug use treatment= The hospital was also one of the first health care facilities in Australia to begin treating AIDS patients when the epidemic reached Sydney in the early 1980s. This was a direct result of the hospital's close geographic position to the predominantly gay areas surrounding nearby Oxford Street and the injecting drug using population of notorious red-light district, Kings Cross. The first patient to be diagnosed with AIDS in Australia was at St Vincent's in October, 1982. As the AIDS epidemic grew in Sydney, the hospital led the way in the compassionate treatment of the sick and the dying, continuing to apply the original values of the Sisters' mission. This early exposure to the frightening implications of a possible pandemic was responsible for St Vincent's becoming one of the leading centres of immunology research and practice in the world. The hospital was also one of the first health care facilities in Australia to suggest the idea of a needle exchange program, in an effort to stem the spread of the virus among IV drug users in the local community, an idea that was highly controversial at the time, and raised the possibility of criminal charges against doctors and other health care workers who implemented it. The hospital instituted Australia's first needle exchange program in 1986. The immunology ward of the hospital was highly regarded and strongly supported by the local gay community, who staged numerous charity events to raise money for AIDS care. However, on 24 November 2007, the hospital announced that this ward would be closed because beds allocated for HIV care were not being used due to advances in HIV treatment (namely, more effective anti-retroviral medications), resulting in fewer patients needing to be admitted for HIV/AIDS related conditions. These patients will, in future, be admitted onto an oncology ward of the hospital. The decision initially upset sections of the HIV community in Sydney, given that the hospital is regarded as one of the leading HIV health care facilities in Australia and that the announcement was made only days before World AIDS Day on 1 December. This was soon rectified after hospital management held discussions with leaders of HIV/AIDS groups in Sydney, explaining the reasons for the ward closure, and highlighting an increase in outpatient and ambulatory care services that will be provided in future for these patients. The hospital has since leased the ward to the Royal Australian Navy while their Balmoral Navy Hospital is refurbished, using their own staff, but making use of St Vincent's pathology and radiology services. =Mental health and homeless care= St Vincent's Hospital in the 1900s. In 1996, St Vincent's joined the Sisters of Charity Health Service, which already encompassed 17 other health care facilities and which is now Australia's largest not-for-profit health care provider. The hospital was extensively upgraded in 2001. The hospital is a primary teaching facility, and offers a wide array of clinical experience to students studying medicine and nursing in particular. It was originally affiliated with the University of Sydney from 1923 to 1968, when it changed affiliation to the University of New South Wales. It also has links with University of Technology, Sydney, Australian Catholic University, University of Tasmania and University of Notre Dame Australia, making it one of Australia's leading teaching hospitals. By 2009, the hospital comprised over 320 medical and surgical beds, and treated more than half a million patients from throughout Sydney and New South Wales each year. The Emergency Department was one of the first in NSW to implement a Psychiatric Emergency Care Centre (PECC), in response to the high number of people with a mental illness residing in the inner suburbs of Sydney, as well as the increasing incidence of people affected by illegal, psychoactive drugs such as heroin, GHB and crystal meth. In line with the Sister's original mission, the hospital oversees the largest population of homeless people in Australia (many of whom also have a mental illness), concentrated in the neighbouring suburbs of Kings Cross, Surry Hills, and Woolloomooloo. The hospital's catchment area also includes some of Sydney's most affluent suburbs, including Vaucluse, Paddington, Bellevue Hill, Rose Bay, Point Piper and Darling Point. =Trauma care= St Vincent's is a recognised trauma centre, resulting in the majority of major trauma cases that occur in and around the inner city being referred to St Vincents, despite Sydney Hospital being geographically closer to Sydney's central business district. Recently, St Vincent's, along with other hospitals in the Sydney metropolitan area has discussed implementing a 24-hour medical clinic, in order to alleviate the pressure on the Emergency Department caused by increasingly, non-urgent presentations.http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/tourists-taking-advantage-of-hospital- loophole-20140620-zsgqi.html Associated facilities The Darlinghurst campus comprises St Vincent's Hospital, St Vincent's Private Hospital, Sacred Heart Hospice, the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. The hospital has a sister affiliation with The Mater Hospital, Sydney, based in North Sydney. Given its proximity to these other facilities, St Vincent's has linkages with these research institutes and other facilities and has earned international recognition in the field of medical research. It is at the forefront of developing new therapies for the treatment of many diseases, including cancer, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, asthma and diabetes. Since 2008, the St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research has operated a number of research programs which are engaged in research pertaining to immunology and cell biology, relevant to diseases such as cancer, HIV-Aids and inflammatory disease. This Centre is a collaboration between St Vincent's Hospital and the University of New South Wales. Notable people Many notable people have died at St. Vincent's Hospital, including cricket players Victor Trumper and, more recently, Phillip Hughes. Prime Minister Joseph Lyons died at St Vincent's Hospital on 7 April 1939, where he had been taken after a severe heart attack two days earlier. He was the first Australian prime minister to die in office.

Contrary to popular belief, he was never an ordained Nichiren priest, but was rather a self-styled preacher whose extremist tenets were widely denounced by Japan‚Äôs mainline Nichiren Buddhist establishment of the time.Hori, Inoue Nissho. p.178  Biography  Inoue was born Inoue Shir≈ç (later adopting the name Akira and then Nissh≈ç, lit. ‚ÄúCalled by the Sun‚Äù) in Kawaba, Gunma Prefecture, in 1887, the son of a rural doctor. Educated at Toyo Cooperative (present-day Takushoku University), he abandoned his studies and traveled to Manchuria where he spent time as a vagabond and ultimately found employment from 1909-1920 with the South Manchuria Railway. Upon his return to Japan, he first studied to become a Zen priest but then became a follower of Nichiren Buddhism, a conversion that led him to relocate to Miho, Shizuoka Prefecture, in order to study under the Nichiren scholar and nationalist preacher Tanaka Chigaku at his Kokuchukai Academy. Inoue met Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba during this time period. Inoue soon became disillusioned with Tanaka‚Äôs teachings, however, and in 1928 he relocated to ≈åarai, Ibaraki, where he established his own temple, , which also served as a youth training center, advocating a militarist revolution in Japan.Modern Biographical Histories, p.16 During this time, with the assistance of former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan Mitsuaki Tanaka, he became acquainted with such right wing figures as Sh≈´mei ≈åkawa and Ikki Kita, and received enthusiastic support from the radicalized young officers of the nearby Tsuchiura Naval Base. In 1930, Inoue moved to Tokyo where he set about forming Ketsumeidan, recruiting members amongst university student radicals.Large, Nationalist Extremism. p.548 Ketsumeidan was officially founded in 1932 together with a group of 13 young officers including Sh≈ç Onuma and Goro Hishinuma, establishing as its goal the overthrow of the political and economic elite of the time, with the motto ‚ÄúOne Man, One Assassination.‚Äù The group‚Äôs first wave of assassinations came in early 1932, when former finance minister Junnosuke Inoue was shot on February 9, as was the Director General of the Mitsui zaibatsu Baron Dan Takuma on March 5, collectively known as the League of Blood Incident. Inoue was arrested soon after the latter assassination, after which Koga Kiyoshi, a trusted subordinate, took over the reins of the group and set about organizing a second wave, which culminated in the May 15 assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, an event known as the \\"May 15 Incident\\". In the trial the Rinzai abbot Gempo Yamamoto testified in favor of his former disciple, justifying his violence from a Zen and imperialist point of view.Zen terror, Brian Victoria, 10 July 2019, Aeon. Quotes from Asahi Shimbun, 15 September 1934. Inoue and the three Ketsumeidan gunmen were sentenced to life imprisonment in November 1934, with the rest of the arrested group members given lighter sentences. Inoue was later granted amnesty and released from prison in 1940.(‰∏ÄÂÑÑ‰∫∫„ÅÆÊò≠ÂíåÂè≤, p. 16) Identified as a fascist by the US occupational forces, he was purged from public life in 1947.

The French translation, which appeared in 1616, was translated from Latin by Trigault's own nephew, David-Floris de Riquebourg- Trigault.Histoire de l'exp√©dition chrestienne au royaume de la Chine entreprise par les PP. de la Compagnie de J√©sus: comprise en cinq livres esquels est traict√© fort exactement et fidelelement des moeurs, loix et coustumes du pays, et des commencemens tr√®s-difficiles de l'Eglise naissante en ce royaume (1616) - French translation of De Christiana expeditione by D.F. de Riquebourg-Trigault. Full text available on Google Books. The translator mentions his relation to N. Trigault on p. 4 of the Dedication (\\"Epistre Dedicatoire\\") In April 1618, Trigault sailed from Lisbon with over 20 newly recruited Jesuit missionaries, and arrived in Macau in April 1619.

Aided by a converted Chinese, he also produced the first Chinese version of Aesop's Fables (Ê≥ÅÁæ© \\"Analogy\\"), published in 1625. In the 1620s Trigault became involved in a dispute over the correct Chinese terminology for the Christian God and defended the use of the term Shangdi that had been prohibited in 1625 by the Jesuit Superior General Muzio Vitelleschi. Andr√© Palmeiro, the Society of Jesus inspector assigned the task of investigating and reporting on the circumstances of Trigault's death in 1628, on information from Trigault's confessor Lazzaro Cattaneo, stated that a mentally unstable Trigault had become deeply depressed after failing to successfully defend the use of the term, and had committed suicide.Brockey, p. 87.

(Illustration by √âdouard-Henri Avril) Pompoir is a sexual technique in which the woman uses her vaginal muscles to stimulate the man's penis.Suzie Heumann, Susan M. Campbell, The Everything Great Sex Book: From Sensuous to Sizzling, the Hottest Tips, Tricks, and Techniques for Spicing Up Your Sex Life, Everything Books, 2004, , p. 63Bobby Dempsey, Tantric Sex, David & Charles, 2007, , pp. 229-230 Both partners remain still, while the woman strokes the man's erection using rhythmic, rippling pulses of the pubococcygeus muscles, so this practice is best performed in a woman on top position. Performing Kegel or pelvic floor exercises can increase a woman's skill in pompoir by strengthening the relevant muscles, and allow her to identify, and isolate, individual muscles, to contract them in turn to provide the rippling sensation. Other names for this technique include the Singapore grip. The title of The Singapore Grip, a novel by J. G. Farrell, as well as its 2020 television adaptation, refers to this phrase. Kabzah \\"Kabzah\\" or \\"Kabza\\" (, ) is a variant technique that originates from South Asia, where the female additionally uses her abdominal muscle contractions to stimulate the penis of the male partner, who must remain totally passive. The word translates as 'holder', and the sensation can be likened to that of 'milking'. Women are reported to have spent many years in training before becoming proficient in this technique, and as such this technique is considered highly difficult to perform. The act itself is a variety of tantra, its purpose being to enhance and increase the duration and intensity of intercourse.Kick, Russ, ed.

It originated in India and perfected in Thailand. The first exercises came with a transformation of the extensive preparatory tantric exercises for the Maithuna. This transformation was initially developed by the priestesses of the Great Mother temples to be used in fertility rituals. With time the technique expanded and became increasingly popular. A similar exercise was developed in the 1950s by gynecologist Arnold Kegel, who in 1952 \\"developed\\" some exercises for women who had a problem with urinary incontinence. With the research he discovered that the pubococcygeus muscle was out of shape and not working properly. By exercising these muscles, the medical problem was solved and the potential for genital sensations and orgasm increased. In part this was due to blood flow increasing in exercised muscles, and the increase in blood flow is related to the ease of arousal and orgasm. When the strength of a muscle increases, the blood supply increases, with the side effect being an increase of blood flow to the pelvis resulting in higher levels of arousal and more intense orgasms.

Originally, as indicated by the name whites, flannels were exclusively white or cream. Today, many competitions (particularly in the shortened one-day version of cricket) are played in coloured kit, also sometimes known as pyjamas. Flannels were originally made from a variety of flannel materials. Typically, modern flannels will have trousers made with a high elastic content, to prevent damage while fielding. Shirts and jumpers can be short or long-sleeved, the former being particularly favoured by bowlers. Wicketkeepers mostly wear long-sleeved shirts, in order to avoid abrasions from the grass when diving for the ball, which is also true for some players while batting due to a similar risk. Jumpers are traditionally made with a cable-knit design. The term flannels is also used in baseball, especially in a historical context when the uniforms were made of wool flannel. At the international level, whites are only worn during Test cricket. One Day International and Twenty20 matches are played with the teams wearing team uniforms in particular colours. One-Day Internationals were first played in whites but since December 2000 all ODI cricket has been played in coloured clothing ‚Äì for example, the Black Caps of New Zealand currently wear a black uniform when playing a one-day match.

Japanese collaboration controversy  After the South Korean liberation from the Japan, there was a drive on the part of Korean historians to present a new history of Korea and it was called Han-guksa sillon. Yi Pyong-do was part of this initiative, which was viewed as new in name only because it inherited the colonialist racial perspective inherited from the Japanese scholarship. Korean historians such as Cho Yun-jae, Son Chin-tae, and Yi In-yong, among other Chindan hakhoe historians followed another direction in their scholarship, which they also labeled \\"new\\" - the new nationalist historiography or sin-minjokjuui yoksahak. This group, specifically, excluded Yi Pyong-do due to his association with the colonial government, particularly the Chosenshi henshukai, which was generally viewed as an instrument used to distort Korean history by suppressing or delegitimizing important texts such as the Samguk yusa. Some sources, however, point out that the charge could be political because the purge of collaborators became part of the post- liberation Korean politics. Yi Pyong-do, himself, addressed the controversy by stressing that he worked for the Chosenshi henshukai to prevent a Japanese distortion of Korean history, a position that echoed the same argument adopted by other historians identified with the Japanese colonial government. Biography He started working in Korean History Compilation Committee in 1927. In 1934 he founded Jindan Institute. From 1945 to 1962 he was Professor of Seoul Nation University. From 1955 to 1982 he was Committee of Korean Nation History Editor. On April 1960, he became the Minister of Education, but later resigned in August of that year.

The reason for the neighborhood's fame was its role as the home to the city's \\"undesirables\\", including prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers and gamblers. For similar reasons of societal exclusion, it was also the site of the city's first Chinatown.Elizabeth Perl (Spring, 1977). San Diego's Chinese Mission, The Journal of San Diego History: Spring 1977, 23:2. Additionally, the neighborhood was home to many other lower-class citizens, and was in the center of a wider blue-collar residential area encompassing much of the city south of Broadway.Mike Davis, Kelly Mayhew, Jim Miller. Under the Perfect Sun. The New Press: New York, 2005 Though the name \\"Stingaree\\" (a colloquial pronunciation of \\"stingray\\") refers primarily to the period before 1916, the neighborhood's character as a vice district lasted until its massive redevelopment in the 1980s. Boundaries The exact boundaries of the neighborhood are contested and likely changed throughout the years. The Health Department identified them as First and Fifth Avenues to the west and east, and Market and K Streets to the north and south.Elizabeth C. MacPhail (Spring, 1974). WHEN THE RED LIGHTS WENT OUT IN SAN DIEGO, The Little Known Story of San Diego's 'Restricted' District, The Journal of San Diego History: Spring 1974, 20:2. Crime in the Stingaree Gambling and prostitution were illegal in California after 1855. However, law enforcement throughout America and especially in the West saw these vices as impossible to eradicate. Special \\"restricted\\" districts were created in many cities where the vices were tolerated so long as they were kept within the boundaries of the district and that there were no greater crimes involved. Illegal payments from the vice trade to the police were also typical components of these bargains. The Stingaree, like the more famous Barbary Coast in San Francisco, was one of these districts. The neighborhood saw a concentration of drug peddlers, brothels and gambling halls. Many other establishments in the neighborhood participated in petty crime, like the Railroad Coffeehouse on Fifth and K that sold liquor after midnight under the title \\"Coffee Royal\\" (coffee and whisky) for 15¬¢. There were at least 120 openly illegal establishments in the district in 1888. Between 1887 and around 1896 Wyatt Earp owned four saloons and gambling halls in San Diego, one on Fifth, one on Fourth Street, and two others near Sixth and E. The saloons offered 21 games including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, and other Victorian-American games of chance like pedro and monte. At the height of San Diego's real estate boom, Earp made up to $1,000 a night in profit. The Oyster Bar on Fifth Avenue was one of the more popular saloons in the Stingaree district. One of the reasons it drew a good crowd was the brothel upstairs named the Golden Poppy. Each room was painted a different color and each prostitute wore a matching dress. In 2003, the Oyster Bar saloon was converted into a restaurant by former San Diego mayor Roger Hedgecock who opened Roger‚Äôs On Fifth. Chinese population The southwest corner of the Stingaree (between Market, K, First and Fourth) was the site of the city's Chinatown from the 1880s until the 1930s. During this period, the Chinese in California were marginalized by sometimes violent anti- Chinese movements, as well as the passage of laws that made it a crime to hire Chinese laborers while there were non-Chinese willing to take the work. This, together with a decline in Chinese fishing due to the fear of being blocked readmission into the country from the waters, led to the creation of a thoroughly impoverished and ghettoized population. Many Chinese fell prey to the neighborhood's opium dens and gambling houses. Social unrest The Industrial Workers of the World found a ready audience with the Stingaree's marginalized working-class population. Their attempts to organize the residents were met with a 1912 ordinance banning street speaking. Furthermore, the city police were given special powers to break up demonstrations. What followed were years of demonstrations by the IWW, AFL, and other groups. These demonstrations were often violently suppressed by the police, turning the neighborhood into a scene of overt social conflict. . City action Starting with the 1880s, there were many election-time promises to reform the Stingaree, most of which were not acted on. In 1912 the Health Department began to eradicate vice in the district. They acted against the recommendations San Diego police chief Keno Wilson, who believed that this would simply spread prostitution into other parts of the city. The health department's action was in keeping with the national Progressive movement that called for closing these districts. Between 1912 and 1916 over 120 structures were destroyed, transforming the image of the city and creating a large homeless population. Many prostitutes were driven out of town. A large portion of the Chinatown was razed in the process as well. Although the name of the district disappeared, extensive raids against prostitution took place as late as 1938, and significant massage parlor raids occurred in 1973.Clare V. McKanna, Jr. Prostitutes, Progressives, and Police: The Viability of Vice in San Diego 1900-1930. The Journal of San Diego History, Winter 1989, 35:1. Vice and poverty dominated the area until its redevelopment in the 1980s. Present day The wild character of the neighborhood was finally removed by modern-day redevelopment. Many of the neighborhood's residents‚Äîand modern red-light uses‚Äîwere removed with eminent domain, tax increment financing and other strong-arm techniques. The redevelopment efforts hinged on turning the neighborhood into an 1880s-themed upscale shopping area. The new Gaslamp Quarter recreates a \\"gaslamp era\\" town that has few characteristics of its actual history as the Stingaree. The last vestiges of the neighborhood's red- light history have been overcome by historical recreationism. There was a restaurant and nightclub called Stingaree at the corner of 6th and Island. In 2011, a taxi driver veered his cab into a crowd outside of the bar and injured 23 people. In 2015, Stingaree was bought out by Hakkasan Group and remodeled. It is now Omnia Nightclub.

He was the LTTE's first Black Tiger (suicide bomber). Early life Vasanthan was born on 1 January 1966. He was from Thunnalai in northern Ceylon. He was the son of a bank manager and had two siblings. He was educated at Hartley College in Point Pedro. LTTE Captain Miller shrine at Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam on Black Tigers Day, 2004. Deeply affected by the suffering of the victims of Black July anti-Tamil riots, Vasanthan joined the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1983 as driver. He became a full time member of the LTTE a year later. He was given the nom de guerre Miller (Millar). During the Vadamarachchi Operation (Operation Liberation) the Sri Lanka Army took over Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam and turned it into a military base. The LTTE resolved to capture the base which was heavily reinforced and surrounded by barbed wire. Miller volunteered to drive a bomb filled vehicle into the heart of the base. Miller visited his family on 29 June 1987 and treated them and his friends to ice cream. On 5 July 1987 the LTTE filled a truck with explosives and wedged Miller's body into the driver's seat so that he couldn't move even if he wanted to. His hands were tied to the steering wheel and one foot to the accelerator. Fellow LTTE cadres started the truck which started moving. Miller steered the explosive filled truck into the army camp at Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam. Miller was most likely killed at the first barricades when soldiers opened fire but the truck kept going, ramming into the main school building and exploding. The explosion created a crater as big as a bus. Other LTTE cadres who were following Miller's truck launched an attack on the camp and captured it. Scores of soldiers were killed and wounded. The incident was videotaped and Miller was posthumously promoted to captain. He became a revered figure in the LTTE and his face was on the insignia of the Black Tigers, the LTTE's suicide wing. 5 July became Karumpuli Naal (Black Tigers Day), a day for Tamils across the world to commemorate all Black Tiger \\"martyrs\\". A shrine, including a golden statue of Miller, was built at Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam. After the Sri Lankan military re-captured the Vadamarachchi region in 1996 they destroyed Miller's shrine but locals managed to save and hide his statue. The statue and new memorial plaque were re- installed in 2002 during the Norwegian mediated Cease Fire Agreement. After war resumed, Miller's statue was attacked and destroyed by armed men on 23 August 2006. The remnants of the shrine - the dais on which Miller's statue stood and stone memorial plaque - were destroyed by the army on 4 July 2010.

The band never released an album on a major label but their drummer went on to form another side-project band called The Stone Crows, and their guitarist participating (without ever recording anything) in various bands such as PROV, DPSA, and Zink. Bands from this early period had a considerable impact on the local punk scene... Their existence rely on a very limited mainstream success. =Early 1990s= During early 1990, the underground punk rock scene in Malaysia was first encountered in Kuala Lumpur.

Political Biography Eymael joined the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) in 1962, in Porto Alegre, becoming a member the Young Christian Democrats. The PDC was extinguished by the Institutional Act number two on 27 October 1965, during Brazil's military dictatorship, and was refounded in 1985. Eymael was responsible for its reorganization in the state of S√£o Paulo. In 1985 Eymael was a candidate for mayor of S√£o Paulo, but lost the election. However, the PDC's campaign jingle, with the chorus \\"Ey Ey Eymael\\", helped make him popular, and has been associated with him throughout his political career. In 1986 and again in 1990, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, the lower house of the National Congress of Brazil. He ran again for mayor of S√£o Paulo in 1992 but lost again. In 1993 the PDC merged with the Democratic Social Party (Partido Democr√°tico Social, PDS), forming the Reform Progressive Party (Partido Progressista Reformador, PPR). Eymael, opposed the merge and left the PPR. In 1995, he founded the PSDC, whose professes a commitment to the family, to defend their values and full service for their needs. =Accomplishments as a Member of the Chamber of Deputies= Congressional Deputy Eymael was rated by the Inter-unionist Department of Parliamentary Advising (Departamento Intersindical de Assessoria Parlamentar, DIAP) as one of the twelve most influential lawmakers in Congress and at the end of the work of the Constituent National Assembly he had 145 proposals approved, placing was among the fifteen with the highest number.

These ships were based on knowledge gained during experimentation with seaplane tenders operated by the Kaiserliche Marine during World War I. Among these were the light cruiser , which was converted to carry three seaplanes, and the armored cruiser , which was to have carried four. These ships did not meet the needs of the High Seas Fleet, however, and so a more ambitious plan to convert the unfinished passenger liner SS Ausonia into an aircraft carrier was proposed in early 1918. The project could not be completed before the war ended in November, however, as resources could not be diverted from the U-boat campaign. Starting in the mid-1930s, the Reichsmarine began design studies for a new type of aircraft carrier to meet the requirements of the revitalized German fleet; by 1936, these concepts had developed into the , the first member of which was laid down for the renamed Kriegsmarine in December of that year. A second vessel, designated Flugzeugtr√§ger B, followed in 1938, and the Plan Z naval expansion plan envisioned a further two carriers of a new design to be in service by 1945. Despite this, neither of the Graf Zeppelin-class ships would be completed due to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939; work was halted on both in early 1940, and Flugzeugtr√§ger B was scrapped shortly thereafter. Work on Graf Zeppelin recommenced in 1942, but was again stopped in early 1943 due to more pressing requirements. During this second period of construction, the Kriegsmarine proposed to convert several passenger ships and two unfinished cruisers into auxiliary aircraft carriers, though none of these were completed either, and by 1945 all had either been sunk or seized as war prizes by the Allied powers. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Aircraft  The number and type of aircraft carried - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel began to be assembled - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } __TOC__ I (1915) The first planned aircraft carrier came about in 1918, late in World War I; the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) had previously experimented with seaplanes operated from ships such as the armored cruiser . A major step forward came in 1918, when the light cruiser was converted into a dedicated seaplane tender. That same year, the Navy decided to convert the passenger ship Ausonia, then under construction, into a flush-deck aircraft carrier. Construction priorities in the last year of the war, however, meant that the ship would never be completed. What shipyard capacity that was available was devoted to building U-boats for the commerce raiding campaign. Without any conversion work having been done, the plan was abandoned. The never-finished Ausonia was broken up for scrap in 1922. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the I class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Aircraft ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  I  8-10 fighters 15-20 bombers/torpedo bombers   2 shafts, 2 steam turbines,  1914  --  Scrapped, 1922 } Graf Zeppelin class Projected recognition drawing had Graf Zeppelin been completed in 1942 The Kriegsmarine began design work on a new class of aircraft carriers in the mid-1930s; the first proposal was for a ship with a capacity of 50 aircraft, prepared in 1935. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement, signed that year, allowed Germany to build up to 35 percent of the strength of the Royal Navy; this equated to worth of aircraft carriers.Reynolds, p. 43 By scaling the design back to , two vessels could be built in the allotted tonnage. During the design process for what would eventually become the Graf Zeppelin class, the size of the new aircraft carriers increased significantly. By the time the keel for the first vessel, provisionally named Flugzeugtr√§ger A (Aircraft carrier A), had been laid down in December 1936, standard displacement had risen to . Displacement continued to rise during construction as the plan was revised; by 1939, it had increased to . The second member of the class, Flugzeugtr√§ger B, was laid down in 1938. By the time the first vessel, now named Graf Zeppelin, was launched in 1940, her displacement had risen to . Neither ship would be completed. The navy decided that it would take too long to complete either ship, and since Graf Zeppelins anti-aircraft guns could be used to strengthen the defenses of recently conquered Norway, the naval command convinced Hitler to halt construction on both vessels in early 1940, and Flugzeugtr√§ger B was broken up shortly thereafter. Work recommenced on Graf Zeppelin in May 1942, but by January 1943, Hitler--furious over the Navy's failure at the Battle of the Barents Sea, where two cruisers were seen off by a convoy's escort--again ordered the ship to be cancelled. The ship was scuttled in 1945 as the Soviet Red Army advanced, but she was raised and seized by the Soviets after the war. Her ultimate fate remained unclear for many years until Soviet records were opened after the end of the Cold War. The Soviet Navy sank her in weapons tests in July 1947; and her wreck was discovered in 2006. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Graf Zeppelin class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Aircraft ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Graf Zeppelin  rowspan=\\"2\\"  12 Bf 109 fighters 30 Ju 87 dive bombers  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,  28 December 1936  rowspan=\\"2\\"  --  Sunk as a target, 24 July 1947 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Flugzeugtr√§ger B  30 September 1936  Scrapped, 1940 } I (1942) By early 1942, the German navy had recognized the value of aircraft carriers, particularly following the British attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto in 1940 and the loss of the German battleship in 1941. The Navy therefore selected several vessels to be converted into auxiliary aircraft carriers in May 1942, including the passenger ship , operated by Norddeutscher Lloyd. As designed, the proposed conversion project would have been larger than even the purpose-built Graf Zeppelin class. She would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers. But serious stability problems and structural weaknesses hampered the project and ultimately proved to be insurmountable. No work had begun on the conversion before the project was cancelled in late 1942. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the I class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Aircraft ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  I  24 Bf 109 fighters 18 Ju 87 dive bombers   4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,  1927  --  Seized by US Army, 1945 } Jade class At the same time the Navy proposed to convert Europa into an aircraft carrier, it also selected the Norddeutscher Lloyd steamers and for conversion into auxiliary carriers. These ships were smaller, which limited their planned complement to 24 aircraft. Like Europa, both ships would have been highly unstable with the installation of a flight deck, but this problem was circumvented by the adoption of heavy ballast in the case of Potsdam--renamed Jade--and the addition of a second, outer hull for Gneisenau--renamed Elbe. Conversion work began in December 1942, but was cancelled in January 1943 in the same order from Hitler that had halted work on Graf Zeppelin. Potsdam was sunk by a mine in May that year while serving as a troop ship, while Gneisenau survived the war to be seized by Britain and used as a troop transport. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Jade class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Aircraft ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Jade  rowspan=\\"2\\"  12 Bf 109 fighters 12 Ju 87dive bombers  rowspan=\\"2\\"   2 shafts, 2 steam turbines,  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1934  rowspan=\\"2\\"  --  Sunk, 2 May 1943 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Elbe  2 shafts, 2 electric motors, 26,000 shp, 19 kn  Seized by Great Britain, 20 June 1946 } Weser Seydlitz, the fourth , was about 95 percent complete when she was cancelled after the outbreak of World War II. She was among the vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers in early 1942, and was to be renamed Weser. But unlike the passenger steamers, significant work was done on the ship; most of her superstructure was removed, though the flight deck was never installed. Her complement was to have been ten fighters and ten bombers. Work ceased in June 1943, and she was towed to K√∂nigsberg, where she was scuttled before the Red Army captured the city in 1945. The Soviets considered raising and cannibalizing her to complete her sister ship , which the Soviets had purchased incomplete from Germany in 1940, but the plan was discarded and she was instead broken up for scrap. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Weser class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Aircraft ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Weser  10 Bf 109 fighters 10 Ju 87 dive bombers   3 shafts, 3 steam turbines,  1936  --  Scrapped, sometime after 1945 } II The final proposal for an auxiliary aircraft carrier conversion was for the incomplete French cruiser , which was in the shipyard at Lorient. As projected, the ship was to have carried a force of eleven fighters and twelve bombers. The conversion plan was prepared by August 1942, but work never began, and the project was cancelled by February 1943. There was not a sufficient work force remaining in Lorient to complete the ship, the harbor was within range of Allied bombers in Britain, and the ship's propulsion system proved to be troublesome for the designers. Ultimately, the unfinished cruiser was retaken by Allied forces and she was completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser for the French Navy by 1956. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the II class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Aircraft ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  II  11 Bf 109 fighters 12 Ju 87 dive bombers   2 shafts, 2 steam turbines,  1938  --  Returned to France, 1945 } Footnotes =Notes= =Citations= References    Aircraft carriers Germany ","title":"List of aircraft carriers of Germany"},{"id":"7691098","text":"Les Cousins may refer to: * Les Cousins (music club), a 1960s folk and blues club in Greek Street, Soho, London * Les Cousins (film), a 1959 film by Claude Chabrol See also * Les Cousins Branchaud, folk group from Sainte-Ursule, Quebec * Les Cousins Dalton, Lucky Luke comic ","title":"Les Cousins"},{"id":"7691107","text":"Alun Wyn JonesWyn is part of his given name and not his surname (which is simply Jones), despite usage by much of the media (possibly due to confusion with the surname Wynne-Jones).

He is the world's most- capped lock forward and Wales' most capped international player. He is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams including Gerald Davies, Gareth Edwards, JPR Williams, Ryan Jones, Adam Jones and Gethin Jenkins.Three Grand SlamsThree Grand Slams He was named as the best player of the 2019 Six Nations Championship. Career Born in Swansea, Jones played his first rugby for Bonymaen RFC. Having previously represented Wales at under-21 level, he made his test debut for Wales in June 2006 against Argentina. Originally playing as a blindside flanker, he became a lock. It was as a lock that he featured, and excelled, in Wales' 2007 Six Nations campaign. He was a member of the Wales side that completed the Grand Slam in the 2008 Six Nations. In March 2009 Jones captained Wales against Italy in the Six Nations, becoming the 126th player to be captain of the country. In 2009 Jones was one of 13 Welsh players selected in the squad for the British & Irish Lions tour to South Africa. He scored a try in his debut for the Lions against the Royal XV. He started the first test and came on as a replacement in the second and third tests. On 18 January 2010, he was named in the 35-man Wales squad for the 2010 Six Nations tournament. During the first 2010 Six Nations game against England, Jones tripped English player Dylan Hartley, for which he was sent to the sin-bin. During his 10 minutes there, England scored 17 points and went on to victory. Jones studied part-time for a degree in law at Swansea University, graduating on 21 July 2010.Mockford, S. \\"Spotlight on Alun-Wyn Jones\\", Rugby World, May 2007 On 23 August 2010, the Ospreys announced that Jones would succeed Welsh teammate Ryan Jones as club captain for the 2010‚Äì11 season. The decision was made, in part, so Ryan Jones could concentrate on the national captaincy during a busy World Cup year. On 30 April 2013, Jones was selected for the Lions' tour to Australia. Due to Sam Warburton's tour-ending injury in the second test, Jones was selected as captain for the deciding third test in Sydney, which the Lions won 41‚Äì16. This made him the first substitute captain to lead the Lions to victory in the final test of a series since 1904. 2014 saw Jones captain Wales three times ‚Äì once against Italy and twice against South Africa. In the 2014 Autumn Internationals, he scored a try in Wales's 28‚Äì33 loss to Australia. In the 2015 Six Nations, he formed a second row partnership with Luke Charteris and won two man-of-the-match awards during the tournament, earning them against Scotland and Italy. Jones made his 100th appearance when Wales faced South Africa in the quarter-finals of the 2015 Rugby World Cup but Wales were knocked out of the competition with South Africa winning 23‚Äì19 and going on to win third place. Jones took part in the 2016 Six Nations and was originally paired with Luke Charteris who was then replaced by Bradley Davies. Jones suffered an injury in the penultimate game against England in the tournament and was replaced with a returning Charteris. Jones returned to action on the 2016 tour to New Zealand, playing his 100th test for Wales in the first test against New Zealand ‚Äì his 106th appearance. His 100th Welsh test ended in disappointment with New Zealand beating Wales 39‚Äì21, going on to win the series 3‚Äì0. He took part in the 2016 autumn internationals but had to miss the first match due to the death of his father, Tim. He returned to play Argentina in which he won man of the match award. On 8 December 2016, Jones broke the Ospreys' record for the highest try scoring forward as he touched down for his 21st try. Jones was named as captain for the Welsh squad for the 2017 Six Nations following Sam Warburton's demotion. Following the campaign, Jones was selected for his third British and Irish Lions tour. During the Lions tour he became one of only seven Lions players to have beaten South Africa, Australia and New Zealand while touring these countries, following the 24‚Äì21 win in the second test. Jones started in all three tests of the series against the All Blacks. In 2019 Jones captained Wales in their Grand Slam victory and was named Player of the Championship in a public vote organised by Guinness, the tournament's sponsor. Following the game, he was referred to by Jonathan Davies and others as \\"the greatest ever\\" Welsh rugby player. On 29 September 2019, in a game against Australia at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, he became Wales' most-capped player, overtaking the record of 129 caps held by Gethin Jenkins.Jones cap record Personal life Jones and his wife, Dr. Anwen Jones, have two daughters.

The architectural form of theatre in Rome has been linked to later, more well-known examples from the 1st century B.C.E. to the 3rd Century C.E. The Theatre of ancient Rome referred to as a period of time in which theatrical practice and performance took place in Rome has been linked back even further to the 4th century B.C.E., following the state‚Äôs transition from monarchy to republic. Theatre during this era is generally separated into genres of tragedy and comedy, which are represented by a particular style of architecture and stage play, and conveyed to an audience purely as a form of entertainment and control. When it came to the audience, Romans favored entertainment and performance over tragedy and drama, displaying a more modern form of theatre that is still used in contemporary times. 'Spectacle' became an essential part of an everyday Romans expectations when it came to Theatre. Some works by Plautus, Terence, and Seneca the Younger that survive to this day, highlight the different aspects of Roman society and culture at the time, including advancements in Roman literature and theatre.Theatre during this period of time would come to represent an important aspect of Roman society during the republican and imperial periods of Rome.  Origins of Roman theatre  Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E as a monarchy under Etruscan rule, and remained as such throughout the first two and a half centuries of its existence. Following the expulsion of Rome's last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, or \\"Tarquin the Proud,\\" circa 509 B.C.E., Rome became a republic and was henceforth led by a group of magistrates elected by the Roman people. It is believed that Roman theatre was born during the first two centuries of the Roman Republic, following the spread of Roman rule into a large area of the Italian Peninsula, circa 364 B.C.E. Following the devastation of widespread plague in 364 B.C.E, Roman citizens began including theatrical games as a supplement to the Lectisternium ceremonies already being performed, in a stronger effort to pacify the gods. In the years following the establishment of these practices, actors began adapting these dances and games into performances by acting out texts set to music and simultaneous movement. As the era of the Roman Republic progressed, citizens began including professionally performed drama in the eclectic offerings of the ludi (celebrations of public holidays) held throughout each year‚Äîthe largest of these festivals being the Ludi Romani, held each September in honor of the Roman god Jupiter. It was as a part of the Ludi Romani in 240 B.C.E. that author and playwright Livius Adronicus became the first to produce translations of Greek plays to be performed on the Roman stage. Prior to 240 B.C.E, Roman contact with northern and southern Italian cultures began to influence Roman concepts of entertainment. The early Roman stage was dominated by: Phylakes(a form of tragic parody that arose in Italy during the Roman Republic from 500 to 250 B.C.E), Atellan farces (or a type of comedy that depicted the supposed backwards thinking of the southeastern Oscan town of Atella; a form of ethnic humor that arose around 300 B.C.E), and Fescennine verses (originating in southern Etruria). Furthermore, Phylakes scholars have discovered vases depicting productions of Old Comedy (e.g. Aristophanes, a Greek play), leading many to ascertain that such Comedic plays were presented at one point to an Italian, if not \\"Latin-Speaking\\" audience as early as the 4th century. This is supported by the fact that Latin was an essential component to Roman Theatre. From 240 B.C.E to 100 B.C.E, Roman theatre had been introduced to a period of literary drama, within which classical and post-classical Greek plays had been adapted to Roman theatre. From 100 B.C.E till 476 C.E, Roman entertainment began to be captured by circus-like performances, spectacles, and miming while remaining allured by theatrical performances. thumb The early drama that emerged was very similar to the drama in Greece. Rome had engaged in a number of wars, some of which had taken place in areas of Italy, in which Greek culture had been a great influence. Examples of this include the First Punic War (264-241 B.C.E) in Sicily. Through this came relations between Greece and Rome, starting with the emergence of a Hellenistic world, one in which Hellenistic culture was more widely spread and through political developments via Roman conquests of Mediterranean colonies. Acculturation had become specific to Greco-Roman relations, with Rome mainly adopting aspects of Greek culture, their achievements, and developing those aspects into Roman literature, art, and science. Rome had become one of the first developing European cultures to shape their own culture after another. With the end of the Third Macedonian War (168 B.C.E), Rome had gained greater access to a wealth of Greek art and literature, and an influx of Greek migrants, particularly Stoic philosophers such as Crates of Mallus (168 B.C.E) and even Athenian philosophers (155 B.C.E).This allowed the Romans to develop an interest in a new form of expression, philosophy. The development that occurred was first initiated by playwrights that were Greeks or half-Greeks living in Rome. While Greek literary tradition in drama influenced the Romans, the Romans chose to not fully adopt these traditions, and instead the dominant local language of Latin was used. These Roman plays that were beginning to be performed were heavily influenced by the Etruscan traditions, particularly regarding the importance of music and performance.  Genres of ancient Roman theatre  Papposilenus, marble statue, c. 100 AD, after a Greek original from the 4th century BC The first important works of Roman literature were the tragedies and comedies written by Livius Andronicus beginning in 240 BC. Five years later, Gnaeus Naevius, a younger contemporary of Andronicus, also began to write drama, composing in both genres as well. No plays from either writer have survived. By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama had become firmly established in Rome and a guild of writers (collegium poetarum) had been formed. = Roman tragedy = No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians‚ÄîEnnius, Pacuvius and Lucius Accius. One important aspect of tragedy that differed from other genres was the implementation of choruses that were included in the action on the stage during the performances of many tragedies.Gesine Manuwald, Roman Republican Theatre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 74. From the time of the empire, however, the work of two tragedians survives‚Äîone is an unknown author, while the other is the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are fabulae crepidatae (A fabula crepidata or fabula cothurnata is a Latin tragedy with Greek subjects) Seneca appears as a character in the tragedy Octavia, the only extant example of fabula praetexta (tragedies based on Roman subjects, first created by Naevius), and as a result, the play was mistakenly attributed as having been authored by Seneca himself. However, though historians have since confirmed that the play was not one of Seneca's works, the true author remains unknown. Senecan Tragedy put forth a declamatory style, or a style of tragedy that emphasized rhetoric structures. It was a style characterized through paradox, discontinuity, antithesis, and the adoption of declamatory structures and techniques that involved a aspects of compression, elaboration, epigram, and of course, hyperbole, as most of his plays seemed to emphasize such exaggerations in order to make points more persuasive. Seneca wrote tragedies that reflected the soul, through which rhetoric would be used within that process of creating a tragic character and reveal something about the state of one's mind. One of the most notable ways that Seneca developed a tragedy, was through the use of an aside, or a common theatre device found within Hellenistic drama, which at the time was foreign to the world of Attic tragedy. Seneca explored the interior of the psychology of the mind through 'self-representational soliloquies or monologues,' which focused on one's inner thoughts, the central causes of their emotional conflicts, their self- deception, as well as other varieties of psychological turmoil that served to dramatize emotion in a way that became central to Roman tragedy, distinguishing itself from the prior used forms of Greek tragedy. Those that witnessed Seneca's use of Rhetoric; pupils, readers, and audience, were noted to have been taught Seneca's use of verbal strategy, psychic mobility, and public role-play, which for many, substantially altered the mental states of many individual's. = Roman comedy = A well preserved Roman theater in Bosra (Syria) All Roman comedies that have survived can be categorized as fabula palliata (comedies based on Greek subjects) and were written by two dramatists: Titus Maccius Plautus (Plautus) and Publius Terentius Afer (Terence). No fabula togata (Roman comedy in a Roman setting) has survived. In adapting Greek plays to be performed for Roman audiences, the Roman comic dramatists made several changes to the structure of the productions. Most notable is the removal of the previously prominent role of the chorus as a means of separating the action into distinct episodes. Additionally, musical accompaniment was added as a simultaneous supplement to the plays' dialogue. The action of all scenes typically took place in the streets outside the dwelling of the main characters, and plot complications were often a result of eavesdropping by a minor character. Plautus wrote between 205 and 184 B.C. and twenty of his comedies survive to present day, of which his farces are best known. He was admired for the wit of his dialogue and for his varied use of poetic meters. As a result of the growing popularity of Plautus' plays, as well as this new form of written comedy, scenic plays became a more prominent component in Roman festivals of the time, claiming their place in events that had previously only featured races, athletic competitions, and gladiatorial battles. All six of the comedies that Terence composed between 166 and 160 BC have survived. The complexity of his plots, in which he routinely combined several Greek originals into one production, brought about heavy criticism, including claims that in doing so, he was ruining the original Greek plays, as well as rumors that he had received assistance from high ranking men in composing his material. In fact, these rumors prompted Terence to use the prologues in several of his plays as an opportunity to plead with audiences, asking that they lend an objective eye and ear to his material, and not be swayed by what they may have heard about his practices. This was a stark difference from the written prologues of other known playwrights of the period, who routinely utilized their prologues as a way of prefacing the plot of the play being performed.  Stock characters in Roman comedy  An ivory statuette of a Roman actor of tragedy, 1st century. The following are examples of stock characters in Roman comedy: * The adulescens is an unmarried man, usually in late teens or twenties; his action typically surrounds the pursuit of the love of a prostitute or slave girl, who is later revealed to be a free-born woman, and therefore eligible for marriage. The adulescens character is typically accompanied by a clever slave character, who attempts to solve the adulescens‚Äô problems or shield him from conflict. * The senex is primarily concerned with his relationship with his son, the adulescens. Although he often opposes his son's choice of love interest, he sometimes helps him to achieve his desires. He is sometimes in love with the same woman as his son, a woman who is much too young for the senex. He never gets the girl and is often dragged off by his irate wife. * The leno is the character of the pimp or 'slave dealer.' Although the activities of the character are portrayed as highly immoral and vile, the leno always acts legally and is always paid in full for his services. * The miles gloriosus is an arrogant, braggart soldier character, deriving from Greek Old Comedy. The character‚Äôs title is taken from a play of the same name written by Plautus. The miles gloriosus character is typically gullible, cowardly, and boastful. * The parasitus (parasite) is often portrayed as a selfish liar. He is typically associated with the miles gloriosus character, and hangs upon his every word. The parasitus is primarily concerned with his own appetite, or from where he will obtain his next free meal. * The matrona is the character of the wife and mother, and is usually displayed as an annoyance to her husband, constantly getting in the way of his freedom to pursue other women. After catching her husband with another woman, she typically ends the affair and forgives him. She loves her children, but is often temperamental towards her husband. * The virgo (young maiden) is an unmarried young woman, and is the love interest of the adulescens, She is often spoken of, but remains offstage. A typical plot point in the last act of the play reveals her to be of freeborn descent, and therefore eligible for marriage.  Roman theatre in performance  A sculpture of Lucius Annaeus Seneca, by Puerta de Almod√≥var in C√≥rdoba =Stage and physical space= Beginning with the first presentation of theatre in Rome in 240 B.C., plays were often presented during public festivals. Since these plays were less popular than the several other types of events (gladiatorial matches, circus events, etc.) held within the same space, theatrical events were performed using temporary wooden structures, which had to be displaced and dismantled for days at a time, whenever other spectacle events were scheduled to take place. The slow process of creating a permanent performance space was due to the staunch objection of high-ranking officials: it was the opinion of the members of the senate that citizens were spending too much time at theatrical events, and that condoning this behavior would lead to corruption of the Roman public. As a result, no permanent stone structure was constructed for the purpose of theatrical performance until 55 B.C.E.Sometimes theatre building projects could last generations before being completed, and would take a combination of private benefactors, public subscription, and proceeds from the summae honorariae or payments for office positions made by magistrates. To demonstrate their benefactions, statues or inscriptions (sometimes in sums of money) were erected or inscribed for all to see in front of the tribunalia, in the proscaenium or scaenae frons, parts of the building meant to be in the public eye. Building theatres required both a massive undertaking and a significant amount of time, often lasting generations. Roman theatres, particularly ones constructed in western-Roman, were mainly modeled off of Greek ones. They were often arranged in a semicircle around an orchestra, but both the stage and scene building were joined together with the auditorium and were elevated to the same height, creating an enclosure very similar in structure and appearance to that of a modern theatre. This was furthered by odea or smaller theatres having roofs or larger theatres having vela, allowing for the audience to have some shade. During the time of these temporary structures, theatrical performances featured a very minimalist atmosphere. This included space for spectators to stand or sit to watch the play, known as a cavea, and a stage, or scaena. The setting for each play was depicted using an elaborate backdrop (scaenae frons), and the actors performed on the stage, in the playing space in front of the scaenae frons, called the proscaenium. These structures were erected in several different places, including temples, arenas, and at times, plays were held in Rome‚Äôs central square (the forum). Societal divisions within the theatre were made apparent in how the auditorium was divided, typically by broad corridors or praecinctiones, into one of three zones, the ima, media, and summa cavea. These zones served to section off certain groups within the population. Of these three divisions, the summa cavea or 'the gallery' was where men (without togas or pullati (poor)), women, and sometimes slaves (by admission) were seated. The seating arrangements of the theatre highlight the gender disparities in Roman society, as women were seated among the slaves. Sur notes that it wasn‚Äôt until Augustus that segregation in the theatre was enforced, to which women had to either sit at or near the back. Theatres were paid for by certain benefactors and were seen as targets for benefaction, mainly out of the need to maintain civil order and as a consequence of the citizens desire for theatrical performance. Theatres were constructed almost always through the interests of those who held the highest ranks and positions in the Roman Republic. In order to maintain segregation of power, those of high rank were often seated near the front or in the public eye (tribunalia). Individuals who made benefactions to the construction of theatres would often do so for propaganda reasons. Whether it be at the hand of an imperial benefactor or a wealthy individual, the high cost of building a theatre usually required more than a single individual‚Äôs donations. In 55 B.C., the first permanent theatre was constructed. Built by Pompey the Great, the main purpose of this structure was actually not for the performance of drama, but rather, to allow current and future rulers a venue with which they could assemble the public and demonstrate their pomp and authority over the masses. With seating for 20,000 audience members, the grandiose structure held a 300-foot-wide stage, and boasted a three-story scaenae frons flanked with elaborate statues. The Theatre of Pompey remained in use through the early 6th century, but was dismantled for it stone in the Middle Ages. Virtually nothing of the vast structure is visible above ground today. =Actors= Roman actors. The first actors that appeared in Roman performances were originally from Etruria. This tradition of foreign actors would continue in Roman dramatic performances. Beginning with early performances, actors were denied the same political and civic rights that were afforded to ordinary Roman citizens because of the low social status of actors. In addition, actors were exempt from military service, which further inhibited their rights in Roman society because it was impossible for an individual to hold a political career without having some form of military experience. While actors did not possess many rights, slaves did have the opportunity to win their freedom if they were able to prove themselves as successful actors.Gesine Manuwald, Roman Republican Theatre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 22-24). The open-air declaiming, gesturing, singing, and dancing of Roman stage acting required stamina and agility.Gesine Manuwald, Roman Republican Theatre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 73. The spread of dramatic performance throughout Rome occurred with the growth of acting companies that are believed to have eventually begun to travel throughout all of Italy. These acting troupes were usually composed of four to six trained actors. Usually, two to three of the actors in the troupe would have speaking roles in a performance, while the other actors in the troupe would be present on stage as attendants to the speaking actors. For the most part, actors specialized in one genre of drama and did not alternate between other genres of drama.Gesine Manuwald, Roman Republican Theatre, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 85. The most famous actor to develop a career in the late Roman Republic was Quintus Roscius Gallus (125BCE- 62BCE). He was primarily known for his performances in the genre of comedy and became renowned for his performances among the elite circles of Roman society.William J. Slater, Roman Theater and Society, (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 36. Through these connections he became intimate with Lucius Licinius Crassus, the great orator and member of the Senate, and Lucius Cornelius Sulla.William J. Slater, Roman Theater and Society, (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 37. In addition to the acting career Gallus would build, he also would take his acting abilities and use them to teach amateur actors the craft of becoming successful in the art. He would further distinguish himself through his financial success as an actor and a teacher of acting in a field that was not highly respected. Ultimately, he chose to conclude his career as an actor without being paid for his performances because he wanted to offer his performances as a service to the Roman people.William J. Slater, Roman Theater and Society, (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996), 41. Until recently, it was commonly believed, that although the possibility exists that women may have performed non-speaking roles in Roman theatrical performances, historical evidence dictated that male actors portrayed all speaking roles. Later research has shown that, although likely rare, there were women who performed speaking roles.Pat Easterling, Edith Hall: Greek and Roman Actors: Aspects of an Ancient Profession Bassilla and Fabia Arete were, for example, two actresses known for their role of Charition in a popular folk comedy.Pat Easterling, Edith Hall: Greek and Roman Actors: Aspects of an Ancient Profession There were certainly successful women stage performers within dance and singing in theatrical performances, many of whom apparently enjoyed widespread fame, and even a guild exclusively for female stage performers, the Sociae Mimae. The public opinion of actors was very low, placing them within the same social status as criminals and prostitutes, and acting as a profession was considered illegitimate and repulsive. Many Roman actors were slaves, and it was not unusual for a performer to be beaten by his master as punishment for an unsatisfactory performance. These actions and opinions differ greatly from those demonstrated during the time of ancient Greek theatre, a time when actors were regarded as respected professionals, and were granted citizenship in Athens.

Parts of the hilly, undeveloped north of Helidon have been protected within Lockyer National Park. History The Country Women's Association Rest Room opened in 1957 (Photo taken in 2009) The Helidon district is called by Aboriginal inhabitants \\"Yabarba\\", the name of the Curriejung, and the nearby spring is known as \\"Woonar-rajimmi\\", the place \\"where the clouds fell down!\\" The name Helidon derives from a pastoral run name established in 1841 by Richard Jones (1786-1852), a merchant and pastoralist. William Turner paid 60 pounds rent for the Hellidon Run of 25,600 acres, in 1853. He was later (1861), appointed magistrate for the district. Richard Kettle (born in Whissendine, England in 1838), together with his family, were amongst the principle farming families to establish Helidon. Following a failed attempt to lease land in Tent Hill in 1871, Richard Kettle was granted 150 Lockyer acres, in 1873, improved to a Homestead in 1878, and a further 80 acres in 1882. Helidon Post Office opened on 1 August 1866. In 1874 settlers in the Helidon District wrote to the Board of General Education, which from 1860 was authorised to establish and administer primary schools, requesting that a school be established in Helidon. The Helidon State School opened on 11 May 1874 with 8 pupils. In 1882, the school had 24 students. Helidon State School was only the second school in the Lockyer Valley district and was the 52nd primary school opened in Queensland. The school's original building was damaged in a cyclone and a new school erected at its current location in School Street in 1919. In 1877, were resumed from the Helidon pastoral run and offered for selection on 24 April 1877. St John the Baptist Anglican Church was dedicated on 9 September 1923 by Archbishop Gerald Sharp, 40 years after it was first proposed to establish a church. It was constructed with volunteer labour. It closed circa 1989. In December 1924, a branch of the Country Women's Association was formed in nearby Gatton, and had a membership of 28 by 1925. The Helidon Branch was formed in 1933. The branch was active but in more recent times struggled with diminishing membership and in 2013 was under threat of closure. The branch closed and the closest branch to Helidon is now the Upper Lockyer/Withcott branch which meets in Withcott.

St. Joseph's Catholic Church was rebuilt and was opened in September 1914 by Archbishop Duhig. = Spring water = The quality of the water at Helidon had long been known to the local indigenous population prior to colonisation, who believed the water had great healing and strength giving properties. They knew the spring water as \\"kowoor\\".Meston, Archibald (1891).

These properties were thought to be the result of high lithium content, leading it to be sold and marketed as a powerful tonic for cleansing the bladder, kidneys and digestive system. In the 1820s, botanist and explorer Alan Cunningham became the first European to be introduced to Helidon's mineral waters. In 1879, chemist Reginald Larard was selling water from the spring as \\"Oogar Dang Water.\\" The soda water was considered by a government analyst to be \\"a valuable discovery\\" and of a quality to \\"satisfy anyone of its immense superiority over all common soda water\\". By 1881 he had entered a partnership with Scottish sportsman and entrepreneur Gilbert E. Primrose, who had purchased the agricultural land around the springs, establishing the Helidon Spa Water Company. To combat competition from imported soft drink products, the company would later merge with Owen Gardner & Sons in 1959 to become Kirks, now owned by Coca-Cola Amatil. With the popularity of Helidon's spa water, the first 'spa park' was opened in 1926. During the 60's, a large caravan park and pool were constructed, briefly earning the area the name 'Toowoomba's Gold Coast'. The area remained popular until the 1980s amid water safety concerns, however a few spa hotels still remain today. =Flooding= On 10 January 2011, Helidon was hit by a wall of flood water which had previously struck Toowoomba, part of the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods.Kerin, Lindy \\"Wall of water hits Helidon\\" .

He left a diary in which he detailed the 361 executions he performed during his 45 year career.  Personal and professional life  Franz Schmidt's father, Heinrich, was originally a woodsman in the north-eastern Bavarian town Hof. Once, when the notoriously tyrannical margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, Albrecht II (r. 1527‚Äì1553), wanted three men hanged, he picked out Heinrich from the crowd and forced him to perform the execution, after which he had no option but to continue in the profession of executioner.in the retelling of Joel F. Harrington: \\"They didn't have a standing executioner and the prince, in a crowd, said to Heinrich Schmidt, Frantz's father: You! You are going to hang these guys! Heinrich replied, I'm not going to do that. The prince said: You hang them or I am going to string you up instead, as well as the two men standing next to you. So Heinrich did it. And once he did it there was no other job. Nobody wanted to have anything to do with him. He and his children were condemned to the occupation.\\" The Faithful Executioner: Joel F. Harrington on the life of sixteenth-century executioner Frantz Schmidt. Franz Schmidt was probably born in 1555, and was about 18 years old when he became executioner under his father's supervision in Bamberg in 1573. Five years later, in 1578, he secured the post as executioner in N√ºrnberg. He married the chief executioner's daughter Maria Beck, and eventually became chief executioner after his father- in-law. He fathered seven children, and his salary, on par with the city's wealthiest jurists, allowed him to have a spacious residence in N√ºrnberg. After his retirement in 1617, he began a new, lucrative career as medical consultant and subsequently received an imperial privilege by Ferdinand II making him \\"ehrlich\\", i.e. an honourable member of society, and thus removing the stain of social stigma from his previous occupation. He was given a lavish funeral in 1634, in one of N√ºrnberg's prominent cemeteries. The grave is still present today. Throughout his career as an executioner, Franz Schmidt also had a side job as a healer. According to Joel Harrington who authored an account of his life, Schmidt's own estimate of patients seeking medical advice amounted to some 15,000 consultations.June 5th 2013: 1573: Meister Frantz Schmidt‚Äôs first execution  Social position of an executioner  The societal position of the professional executioner was ambiguous, as Harrington explains Furthermore,  Significance of diary  His journal of punishments executed by him has survived and contains accounts of 361 executions and 345 minor punishments (floggings and ear or finger amputations). The individual entries contain date, place, and method of execution, name, origin, and station in life of the condemned and ‚Äì in later years more verbose than in the earlier ones ‚Äì details of the crimes on which the sentence was based. Schmidt executed criminals by rope, sword, breaking wheel, burning, and drowning. The wheel was reserved for severely violent criminals. Burnings (for homosexual intercourse and counterfeiting money) occurred only twice in his whole career, and drowning ‚Äì prescribed by the Carolina for a woman committing infanticide ‚Äì was commuted regularly in the Nuremberg of Schmidt‚Äôs time into execution by sword, partly upon the intervention of Schmidt and some clergy.

She is the granddaughter of Azam Khan, one of the legends of squash in Pakistan and daughter of Jacqui Stoter and Wasil Khan. She started playing squash in England at age 12. In her early life, her father Wasil Khan coached her in squash. Khan has won five titles in her career: El Salvador Open 2002, Ottawa Open 2003, Pakistan Open 2005 and Iranian Open 2007 and Austrian Open in 2008. Her highest ranking was 21st. Her first tournament was at the prestigious British Open in 1999. After an unsuccessful first full season in 2000, she made a breakthrough the following year, but it was not until 2002 that she won her first title. In November 2002, at the El Salvador Open, she reached her first final against Mexican Samantha Ter√°n. Khan beat her 9‚Äì1, 2‚Äì9, 9‚Äì3, 9‚Äì1. Her improvements continued in 2003, her most successful season yet, and won at the Ottawa International, where she came from behind to beat Melissa Martin from Australia, 3‚Äì9, 4‚Äì9, 9‚Äì4, 9‚Äì7, 9‚Äì3. She broke into the top 30. At the Irish Open in 2004, Khan defeated Nicol David of Malaysia (who was ranked number 9 in the world at that time) on 15 April 2004, and achieved her highest ranking of 21. In 2005, Khan lost in the final of the Forbes Open to England's Alison Walters. However, she made it to the final of the 1st POF WISPA tournament in Pakistan, and beat Sharon Wee of Malaysia 9‚Äì1, 9‚Äì3, 9‚Äì4. Khan never dropped a set throughout the whole tournament. She ended the year by making it to yet another final, at the 4th Women Islamic Games 2005 in Tehran, but lost to Malaysian Tricia Chuah with a score of 1‚Äì9, 9‚Äì6, 1‚Äì9, 1‚Äì9. In late 2005 she was unwell, and struggled in early 2006 until she collapsed during the 2006 South Asian Games on 24 August 2006 while playing against Joshna Chinappa from India. Khan was not expected to be back until 2008, but she returned playing in September 2007. This had seen her rankings slide outside the top 200, but she won her fourth title in 2007, at the Iranian open, beating Donna Urquhart in the finals. In 2008, Khan defeated England's Emma Beddoes 9‚Äì2, 9‚Äì2, 9‚Äì0 to take the Austrian Open. Khan then retired. She made a comeback in 2009. However, unable to continue, she retired again and now has moved on to television presenting. She appeared on the ITV dating game show Take Me Out in January 2011.

While quite young he took part in the struggle for American independence as an aide de-camp to General Lawson. In the year 1785 he came to Kentucky and settled near Lexington subsequently he came to his estate on the Licking River near Newport called Leitch's Station. There he erected himself a block-house to protect himself and his associates against the Indians at which place he died Nov 7th A.D. 1794. He was also a member of the first convention of Kentucky. David was the youngest of 5 sons, and six daughters, born to David Leitch of Kilmardinny, and Jean Bryson of Craigallan. David was the brother of Major Andrew Leitch, 3rd Virginia Regiment, who died shortly after the Battle of Harlem (d. 10.1.1776) on 9.16.1776.

The head and underparts are bright red, and the back is mottled black; a yellow patch at the cheek distinguishes it from others of the genus Platycercus. Adults of the species exhibit sexual dimorphism with the females duller overall; juveniles lack the striking colours of mature birds and the characteristic patterning is not as easily distinguished. Their communication call is a softly delivered pink-pink sound, and much of their behaviour is comparatively unobtrusive. Their habitat is in eucalypt forests and woodlands, where they often remain unobserved until they appear to feed on seeds at nearby cleared areas. Individuals form mating pairs and generally remain in one locality, although they will venture out to join small groups at plentiful sources of food. The western rosella is predominantly herbivorous, its diet consisting mostly of seeds of grasses and other plants, although nectar and insect larvae are sometimes eaten. The damage attributed to the species at introduced fruit and grain crops saw them declared as a pest and permitted by the state to be killed or captured. They are more placid and sociable than rosellas of other Australian regions from which they are geographically isolated and have become internationally popular as an aviary bird. Their history in aviculture begins with two 1830 lithographs of live specimens in England by Edward Lear. Successful breeding in captivity began there during the early 20th century. The population is classified as two subspecies, representing an inland group residing at the agricultural district and another nearer the coast in kwongan, tall forest and a variety of woodlands. The abrupt intersection of these groups' range, delineated by country of lower rainfall between Albany and Geraldton, is a zone of hybridisation between the two subspecies Platycercus icterotis icterotis and P. icterotis xanthogenys. The classification of the species relationship to sister taxa of Platycercus is less complex, due to their ecological and geographic isolation, and they are allied to a subgenus Platycercus (Violania) . Taxonomy The first description of the species was published by C. J. Temminck and Heinrich Kuhl in 1820 as Psittacus icterotis,Psittacus icterotis Temminck, C.J. & Kuhl, H. in Kuhl, H. 1820. Conspectus Psittacorum. Cum specierum definitionibus, novarum descriptionibus, synonymis et circa patriam singularum naturalem adversariis, adjecto indice museorum, ubi earum artificiosae exuviae servantur. Nova Acta Physico-Medica Academiae Caesareae Leopoldino-Carolinae 10: 1‚Äì104 pls I-III using a collection obtained at King George Sound (Albany, Western Australia). Kuhl was once mistakenly given sole authorship for the description; this was later corrected to include Temminck; Kuhl himself cited Temminck's earlier work in the text describing their three specimens. The epithet icterotis, meaning 'yellow ear', is derived from ancient Greek and presumed to refer to the yellow cheek. They were separated from the genus Psittacus in 1830 by Nicholas Vigors, to the genus Platycercus he had erected five years earlier; the specific epithet he nominated was Platycercus stanleyii. \\"Platycercus xanthogenys\\" Keulemans, 1891. This is an illustration of the type specimen of subspecies Platycercus icterotis xanthogenys. Two subspecies are recognised at the Australian Faunal Directory, the nominate Platycercus icterotis icterotis and a description of inland specimens as subspecies Platycercus icterotis xanthogenys. The inland subspecies cites Tommaso Salvadori's 1891 description of a new species Platycercus xanthogenys, published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, emerging from his work on a catalogue of psittacine specimens at the British Museum; the latter work contains an illustration of the holotype by J. G. Keulemans. A revision in 1955 by Arthur Cain proposed the type locality for P. icterotis xanthogenys was Wongan Hills, arbitrarily, but accepted as logical in assuming that John Gould's field worker, John Gilbert, could have obtained a specimen there and it resembled those found occurring at that location. A revision by Herbert Condon, published in the Checklist of the Birds of Australia (RAOU, 1975), supports a classification of two subspecies: * Platycercus (Violania) icterotis icterotis (Temminck & Kuhl, 1820) ** synonyms: Psittacus icterotis Temminck & Kuhl, 1820 [and Temminck 1821]; Platycercus stanleyii Vigors, 1830; Platycercus icterotis salvadori Mathews. * Platycercus (Violania) icterotis xanthogenys Salvadori, 1891 ** synonyms: Platycercus xanthogenys Salvadori, 1891; Platycercus icterotis whitlocki Mathews, 1912. Revision and cataloguing in the 20th century began to examine the classification of the few known specimens, often supplied without location details, and, excepting A. J. North, cited the work of Savadori in 1891. In a review of material in the Tring collection in England, supplemented by Bernard Woodward at the Perth Museum and the collection of field worker J. T. Tunney, the trinomial Platycercus icterotis xanthogenys was published by Ernst Hartert in 1905. The author Gregory Mathews, an avid exponent of subspecific classification, cites the species Platycercus xanthogenys Salvadori, but disposed of the epithet xanthogenys when tentatively proposing three new taxa. Mathews notes Salvadori's separation of the type specimen from two others in the Gould collection, then held at the London museum, and caution in only giving the source of the skin as \\"unknown, but probably Australia\\". Mathews proposed three subspecies in 1912, each given a brief distinguishing remark to be expanded in a later volume of his series Birds of Australia. The entry in that 1917 work addresses the type of nominate P. icterotis icterotis, which he had earlier ascribed to the location \\"Shark Bay\\". This was corrected by Mathews to the location \\"Albany, South-West Australia\\". In the preface to the same volume, Mathews attributes the material examined from the southwest of Australia to the collections of the botanist Robert Brown on the Flinders expedition. The author also corrected his reference to \\"Point Cloates\\", given in his 1912 determination of the unknown source of the type in Salvadori's 1891 description, Platycercus xanthogenys. He put the location beyond York, Western Australia. This is where John Gilbert was known to have collected when visiting the western colony in the 1830s. A new taxon P. icterotis salvadori (yellow-cheeked parrot) differentiates those found at Wilson's Inlet as \\"having less red on the mantle\\", and another, P. icterotis whitlocki (Dundas yellow-cheeked parrot), as smaller, less blue at the wing, and more subdued red feathers at the head in the specimens obtained from Lake Dundas (Dundas). The epithet whitlocki was used by authors in ornithological literature to honour the Western Australian field research of Frederick Lawson Whitlock. The notes of Whitlock and other authors reporting from Western Australia, including Tom Carter and A. W. Milligan, were assembled or quoted by Mathews. Errors introduced to the scant body of knowledge by himself and others were acknowledged. The variation in the colours of the back was proposed to accord with differing habitat or as a characteristic of fully mature plumage. He concluded there were at least two subspecies‚Äîapproximating the coastal and inland forms‚Äîthat may prove to be more diverse if a complete series of specimens was examined. The description of the population as two or three subspecific taxa by Mathews is cited within the species circumscription, his P. icterus whitlocki, along with Salvadori's P. xanthogenys, are noted as synonyms for the inland subspecies. The platycercine parrots have seen various systematic arrangements to circumscribe the contentious sister taxa of northern and eastern Australia, most of which overlap in range and intergrade. One study resulted in new genera being published by Wells and Wellington in 1992. In their classification, the genus name Hesperapsittacus was described, and this species was proposed as the type. That revision was subsumed several years later, by Richard Schodde (1997), to subgeneric names; the name Hesperapsittacus became available for Schodde's subgenus, but he nominated their genus name Violania instead for the alliance of subgenus Platycercus (Violania) Wells & Wellington, 1992. Consequently, the two genera of Wells and Wellington, Violania and Hesperapsittacus, became synonymous with the subgeneric name of this species. This arrangement allies the western species to the \\"Platycercus eximius- adscitus-venustus\\" complex, which were separated to species by Les Christidis and Boles in 2008. The validity of the alliances in the subgeneric arrangement, especially of Platycercus (Violania), was tested in 2015, with a multilocus approach to phylogenetic analysis, and proposed a hypothesis that challenges the relationships within the genus. Henry Constantine Richter's Platycercus icterotis, rechristened the \\"Earl of Derby Parrakeet\\", 1848 Common names for moyadong include western rosella, rosehill, rosella and roselle, vernacular that appears to have elided from an early name for a species observed at Rose Hill, New South Wales, \\"Rose-Hiller\\", and translocated with its origin forgotten. The names Stanley rosella and yellow-cheeked rosella or parakeet are historical and trade alternatives. The name Western rosella was formally assigned by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) (now BirdLife Australia) in 1923 to distinguish the name rosella or 'rose-hiller'. These were retroactively assigned as geographic descriptors of the name 'rosella', an informal name that persisted from the colonial period into the 20th century. Gould also records 'rose-hill' as an informal ('colonial') name for this species and two others existing in the local language. An 1898 report of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science listing vernacular for Australian birds proposed \\"Yellow-cheeked Parrakeet\\" for this species. Another early name was The Earl of Derby's Parrakeet, an appellation applied by Gould in 1848 to conserve the honour given to a titled Englishman Edward Smith-Stanley in the epithet used by Vigors, stanleyii, that was displaced by the rule of precedence with the earlier epithet, icterotis, assigned by Kuhl. Gould's explanation of his neologism in naming the 'parrakeet' was inserted with the apology \\"as bound by justice to the first describer ‚Ä¶ I feel I shall have the acquiescence of all ornithologists\\". The caption to the 1830 lithographs in Lear's Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots also gives \\"Stanley Parrakeet\\" for his patron, then known as Lord Stanley, applying the name \\"Platycercus stanleyii\\" published by Vigors in the same year. Other terms are used to identify two specimens illustrated in Mathews Birds of Australia (v.6, 1917), distinguished by the descriptors 'red-mantled' and 'yellow-cheeked' parrots. The bird was marketed by dealers in England as a 'small variety' of the commonly kept rosella, P. eximius, and maintained the Earl's appellation. Popular names for the species in aviculture include Stanley rosella for the species, and the western rosella for the nominate form, and 'red-backed western' or 'Salvadori' rosella for the inland subspecies, P. icterosis xanthogenys, when recognised as distinct; the latter is noted and named for dark red feathers at the back. \\"Western Rosella\\" has been designated as the official name of the species by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), the same name assigned by the RAOU in 1923. The pre-existing names, derived from the Nyungar language, were recorded as regional and literal variants, representing dialectic shifts and often inconsistent spelling by the transcriber. These were first compiled by the colonial diarist George Fletcher Moore, supplementing the work of others with his own, and first published in 1842.\\"GuldƒÉnguldƒÉn, s.‚ÄîPlatycercus Icterotis; red-brested parrot. \\" Moore, G. F. A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia, 1842. p. 31 [wikisource transcript.]. The names of Moore and other authors were reviewed and published in Serventy and Whittell Birds of Western Australia (1948, & eds.), those recorded at \\"Perth\\", Good-un-goodt-un, Guddanang-uddan and Guldanguldan, and at \\"Avon River\\", Moy-a-duk and Moyadong, the second location referring to the district at Avon River. A recommended orthography and pronunciation list (Abbott, 2009) of Nyungar avian nomenclature, with broad cultural consultation, has proposed moyadong [moy‚Äôa‚Äôdawng] and kootonkooton [koot‚Äôawn‚Äôkoot‚Äôawn] be adopted to complement the systematic nomenclature. Description The smallest species of its genus, the adult western rosella weighs and is long. It has broad wings with a wingspan and a long tail that is on average , equally half the measurement of its total length. It is the only species of the genus that exhibits marked differences in the coloration of the genders ‚Äîthe red of the plumage is more scarlet in male P. icterotis. Females are less striking in their colouring, the more subdued red plumage being flecked with green and a smaller dull yellow patch at the cheek. The adult male has a predominantly red head and neck, with a yellow cheek patch‚Äîbright yellow in the nominate subspecies and pale cream in subspecies xanthogenys. The red feathers are fringed with black when new. The back has indistinct black feathers mottled with red, green, and buff variation, being scalloped with these colours at the feather's edges. When folded, the wing is green, becoming black with green margins on the shoulder, with a narrow dark blue shoulder patch and blue-edged dark primary coverts. The blue of the flight feathers and coverts at the underwing is apparent when taking to the air. The upper tail coverts and rump are green tending to olive, perhaps with a red margin. The central tail rectrices are blue and green, outer tail feathers are a similar blue with a white tip. The undertail feathers are blue with white fringes. The underparts are red with green flanks. The beak is pale blue-grey with a dark grey cere. The legs and feet are slate grey, and the iris is dark brown. In the adult female, most of the red plumage of the head, neck and underparts is replaced by green, bar a solid red band across the forehead. The yellow cheek patch is smaller, and there are no red feathers on the back and scapulars. The female has a broad white or cream bar on the underwing. Immature birds resemble the adult female though with even more green plumage, red only on the crown, and lacking a yellow cheek patch entirely. The bill and cere are light pink, changing to adult coloration by six months of age. The population has a cline in colour variation from east to west, and variable degrees of hybridisation are reported east of the Darling Range and in the southern region and Stirling Range. This intergrading between forms is recorded at locations such as Albany. Southwest Australia is also inhabited by similar, albeit larger, parrots‚Äîthe red-capped parrot (Purpureicephalus spurius), readily distinguished by its yellow rump, and Port Lincoln Barnardius zonarius parrots, which present a blue cheek and black head in contrast to the green, red and yellow of this species. =Vocalisations= Male adult walking through leaf litter The regular vocalisation is a rapid series of melodious notes delivered at a low volume. The vocalisation of sister species of other regions is notably louder and more frequently heard in raucous exchanges with other individuals or species. The transliterations of the soft and musical sounds include ching-ching-ching (Morcombe, et al), chink-chink (Serventy, Simpson) and pink-pink (Johnstone, et al), although they more often remain quiet and unheard. Gould (1848) reported the whistling of the notes as a feeble, piping sound and the rich variation in the series might be regarded \\"as almost to assume the character of a song\\". Other sources identify two vocalisations, a resonant and high frequency quink, quink, quink, quink and the softer voiced call of whip-a-whee. The contact call is similar to, although louder than the mulga parrot (Psephotellus varius). Distribution and habitat The western rosella is endemic to the southwest of Australia, isolated from sister species of the north and east of the country. Moderately common, it is usually sedentary, frequenting forest and many other types of wooded country or kwongan. It also occurs in farmland or at other feeding opportunities, and is most often observed at sites cleared of vegetation. The captive occurrence in Australia and several other continents began before 1830 in England. Plate 23 of Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots, first depiction of the species by Edward Lear, November to December 1830, entitled \\"Platycercus Stanleyii / Stanley Parrakeet\\", named for the patron Lord Stanley The two subspecies are geographically adjacent‚ÄîP. icterotis xanthogenys at the wheatbelt region, inland to the north and east of the range and P. icterotis icterotis occurring at coastal areas in the south and west. The inland boundary of the species' range extends from the area between the lower part of the Swan River and the Arrowsmith River at the western coast. From there it passes to the east and south before Southern Cross, the Fraser Range, Esperance, Stirling Ranges and Kojonup. The line of demarcation between the inland and coastal subspecies begins east of King George Sound and lies to the northwest via Mount Barker and the Kojonup region toward the Bannister River. The species is less common on the Swan Coastal Plain than in southern areas of the wheatbelt, where it is more frequently observed around Narrogin and Katanning at remnant wandoo woodland, They occur throughout the conservation area at Dryandra Woodland. Authors came to express doubts on the status of the subspecies, and compiled observations show no geographical separation. The historical records of the species indicate it relatively uncommon, although it has been noted more often in southern regions. The northernmost extent of the distribution range is near Moora, with records extending toward the east around Norseman. The population of the species has declined significantly since colonisation, especially the inland P. icterotis xenogenys after the 1970s. It became locally extinct in shires where it had previously been recorded, these include: Coorow, Dandaragan, Moora, Dalwallinu, Merredin, Quairading, Serpentine-Jarrahdale and the Shire of Murray. Population declines have also been recorded in the shires of Swan, Kalamunda, Northam, York, Armadale-Kelmscott, Capel and Dumbleyung. This disappearance at northern and eastern parts of the Wheatbelt is the result of habitat removal, and no shires show an increase in records. The adaptation to introduced agricultural crops has been comparatively limited when contrasted with the range of seeds harvested by ringnecks Barnardius zonarius and others species. This is likely to have restricted their success in migration to or re-population of greatly altered landscapes. The suggested movement after breeding toward the coast during the austral summer, from areas in the north of the range, lacked evidence of large-scale seasonal movement in occurrence data, The distribution of P. icterotis icterotis is restricted to humid and subhumid regions, an area south of Dandaragan and lower reaches of the Moore River, and to the west of: Wannamal, Muchea, Mundaring, Jarrahdale, Marrinup, Collie, Boyup Brook, Hay River (upper), and from the ranges of Porongurups and Green Range. Records for P. icterotis xanthogenys are from the southern interior of Western Australia, semiarid climatic zones, that formerly included Wongan Hills and occurrences at: Kununoppin, Moorine Rock, Parker Range, Yardina Rock and Ten Mile Rocks. The range extends to the west at: Toodyay, Dale River, Mt Saddleback and Kojonup and north of the Stirling Range, Fitzgerald River (lower), Ravensthorpe, Frank Hann National Park and Red Lake. The occurrence farther north is termed casual, the locations are: Mt Jackson, Karalee and Gnarlbine Rock. A significant change in abundance was noted at Grass Patch, where it was common in the mid-20th century and reappeared after a fifteen-year absence in later decades. The erroneous locations reported by Mathews, Point Cloates and Shark Bay, were later admitted to have been incorrect by the author; he also identifies the obvious error in Gould's protologue (1837) in extending the range from King George Sound to \\"‚Ä¶ New South Wales. etc.\\". The species was later reported by Gould (1848) as only known at the Swan River Colony, a location where it is now uncommon. They favour woodland habitat with sheoak (Allocasuarina), wurak (Eucalyptus salmonophloia) and wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo, et al), but have sometimes flourished at areas cleared for introduced grain crops in the region's Wheatbelt. They also appear at other cleared areas adjoining bushland, such as roadsides, golf courses and reserves, to harvest grasses or weeds. The subspecies occur in differing types of vegetation, living in communities associated with their woody upper-storey plants. The coastal subspecies P. icterotis icterotis is seen amongst the eucalypts and paperbarks of the high rainfall area from Jurien to Green Range, east of Manypeaks, namely marri (Corymbia calophylla), karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), moitch (E. rudis) and the paperbark (Melaleuca). They are known to feed on the fruit of Bossiaea linophylla and Leucopogon obovatus, the flowers of marris and fleshy part of the seed of Macrozamia riedlei. The subspecies feeds both on the ground and in trees. The wooded scrub of the lower rainfall inland region inhabited by P. icterotis xanthogenys is generalised as eucalypt and sheoak, the trees moitch, wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo), wurak and in tall mallee country or the habitat at the rock, or sighing, sheoak (Allocasuarina huegeliana). This subspecies feeds at seeding wandoo, Acacia huegeliana, Glischrocaryon flavescens and Olearia revoluta and flowering Eucalyptus eremophila and Melaleuca acuminata.  Behaviour  The western rosella usually socialises in pairs, but congregates in groups of twenty or so to forage when the season or opportunity permits; numbers in a flock are occasionally recorded up to twenty-six. The birds are discreet in their behaviours‚Äîmore so than other rosellas‚Äîand will remain unobserved when feeding on the ground beneath the understory of a woodland or sheltering during the day in the dense foliage of trees. The usual tendency of individuals is to remain sedentary, although birds may venture out to abundant sources of seed. Individuals feeding in the open are not usually disturbed by human presence and can be approached quite closely. They appear to move with ease as they walk, and in their undulating flight, when the wing is drawn to their side. Their flight is more 'buoyant' than the laden efforts of the other larger species of the genus. =Breeding= The breeding habits of the western rosella have not been well- studied; females enter nesting hollows from July, with males doing so from mid-August. Eggs are laid from late August to late September and hatch late September to late October. Young birds fledge (leave the nest) late October to mid-November. The group in a study at Wickepin and Dudinin (Kulin Shire) was observed to begin occupancy of nest sites in July, the routine of the female being fed by the male being established in the week before laying the brood. The western rosella nests in hollows and spout-shaped holes of living and dead trees, generally eucalypts and most commonly karri and wandoo. The trees are generally large and old, with one study establishing an average age of 290 years for the host tree. Eucalypts are a preferred tree species in which to lay their eggs, the dominant Eucalyptus marginata of jarrah forest, or in the tall forest tree karri, but they especially favour wandoo. Holes in tree stumps and fence posts are also used. Other trees selected include eucalypts such as marri, wurak, yandee E. loxophleba (york gum) and moitch (flooded gum). The hollows are usually a meter or so deep, and those that have dust created by boring insects in the bottom are preferred. The brood is laid directly onto the wood dust or debris in the cavity selected; the site is otherwise unadorned. The dimensional description of the nest site, relating height, depth and entrance size used by the species, was included in a study of animals occupying tree cavities in jarrah forest, and intended to assist in determining the amount of suitable habitat removed and remaining after logging. The nest site is typically a spout shaped entrance, between in width, at a hollow between in depth leading to a green limb. One brood is usually reared per breeding season, though often two are in captivity. The clutch size is between two and seven (rarely nine) eggs, with the average being around six. The shell has a slight gloss, and the shape is elliptical. The average size of eggs is . Measurements from a sample of 29 eggs gave a size range of √ó . Only the female incubates the eggs, leaving the nest in the morning and afternoon to eat food found by the male. The male remains close to the site, feeding at ground level and moving to an upper branch to call when catering to the brooding female. The young emerge from the egg after an incubation period of 23 to 25 days, and leave the nest approximately five weeks after that. The nestlings have yellowish bills and display down at the rear that is pale grey, after they emerge from their egg. The success rate of egg numbers surviving to become independent individuals, while assumed to be seasonally variable, was measured in one survey to be 72%. =Feeding= The diet consists primarily of seeds, often those of introduced weeds and crops, although typically from eucalypt, sheoak and other native plants of the wooded environment. This is supplemented with nectar and insects especially during the breeding and feeding of young. The harvesting of introduced species includes the capeweed (Arctotheca calendula), thistles (Carduus spp.), flatweed (Hypochaeris spp.) and the subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum). Nectar, insects and their larvae, and fruit are also eaten, especially during the breeding season. Immature birds at a picnic area in karri forest They exhibit little caution in rural areas, gleaning seeds at paddocks after harvests or inside buildings and animal pens. The habit of visiting colonial farmland for seed and soft fruit, and lack of concern at human presence, was first reported by Gould in the years immediately following the region's settlement by the English. Tom Carter later extended this familiarity of the species to its casual entrance into buildings in search of food. A 1984 study of three parrots of the Southwest, all of which were observed to feed mainly on seed and fruit of introduced species, noted that the impact on soft fruit crops was less than red-capped parrot and Port Lincoln Barnardius zonarius parrot species. The damage to crops is regarded as minimal, appearing to eat fruit in orchards already damaged by those parrots and mainly gleaning for seed when feeding near protea flower crops. Conservation status For the perceived impact on agriculture, the species had been declared vermin by the Western Australian state in 1921. The western rosella remained a declared agricultural pest until 1998, when it was instead declared to be a 'protected native species' and its destruction was prohibited. The state's governmental response was to warn of prosecution and issue general advice and licensing for the use of non-lethal firearms and netting over trees for deterrence; licenses for the extermination of the species were available on application in 2009. The conservation status of the species is as protected fauna, and of the inland subspecies is one of \\"likely to become extinct\\". In the assessment of the inland P. icterotis xanthogenys for the federal government's Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000 it was assigned the status of 'near threatened'. The 2013 assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on their IUCN redlist assigns a status of species of least concern. It notes the species has become less common and locally extinct and the population trend is declining due to removal of habitat. Like most species of parrots, the western rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is placed on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild- caught animals illegal. P. icterotis was used in a comparative study of tolerance in some Australian birds to sodium fluoroacetate, a highly toxic substance that occurs in plants of the southwest and commercially branded as \\"1080\\", to evaluate their sensitivity against the exposure and mobility of other species. This species and the red-capped parrot‚Äîboth endemic‚Äîexpress a high tolerance of the potentially lethal salt. Captivity Plate 24 of Lear's Illustrations (1830), depicting a captive specimen in England. Western rosellas are a popular bird in aviaries and for zoological gardens, displaying the favourable characteristics of related species without the reputation for aggression and raucous vocalisation. Their status in Australian aviculture is classified as secure. The species is able to breed in the first year, and females may lay up to two broods. Along with a reputation as being placid in nature, the success of their reproduction has increased the population in captivity. An individual cock, aged twelve and onward, was reported by one enthusiast (Whelan, 1977) to have sired twenty-seven progeny over four seasons. Popular interest in the captive form, red-backed Western rosella, which purports or adopts the subspecific description, P. icterotis xanthogenys (Salvadori), was supported by research published in Western Australia. The author (Philpott, 1986) sought to identify and discriminate plumage between the red-backed (inland) and nominate form, nominally the subspecies of coastal regions P. icterotis icterotis. Several characteristics were identified, and later tabulated and summarised by workers in aviculture. Apart from the more subdued green and yellow of the inland form, the chin is white‚Äîrather than yellow‚Äîextending out to lighten the cheek patch. The same red-backed individuals were observed to have a second stripe at the underwing of fledglings, less distinct and closer to the base of the secondary feathers. This disappears from view after two months and altogether in the males of the form. Sexing individuals by comparison of the colouring does not present the difficulties found in other captive rosellas, being markedly gender dimorphic they are easily assigned. Unusually, head scratching is done by arching out the foot behind and over the wing. As with the white-cheeked rosellas, the underwing stripe that is characteristic of juveniles in the genus is retained into maturity by the females. Nesting boxes in aviaries are destroyed if not reinforced, chewing on logs is preferred and these provide hollows for laying a clutch of eggs. The breeding season occurs from September until January, the clutch of four to five eggs is incubated in around twenty days. Fledging is about twenty-five days after hatching, full adult feathers appear at around fourteen months. P. icterotis had been successfully maintained in 19th century aviaries and menageries in Australia and overseas. From the beginning of the 20th century, confirmation emerges of them also being bred and raised in captivity. The specimens painted by Lear, two living captives in England, were published in Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae between 1830 and 1832. The first record of breeding in England was by two aviculturalists in July 1908, with another reporting success later that year. A bird breeder in Kendal produced young from 1910 to 1915. The species became uncommon in English aviculture during the 1950s, and those available said to be poor specimens. An attempt was made to breed a wild caught pair imported under license. Hybrids between this species and mealy rosella, and less successfully with red-rumps, were also produced there. In a sampling of captive birds in Poland for detection of the bacteria Chlamydophila psittaci, implicated in the infectious disease psittacosis, the testing of a single specimen of P. icterotis in the baseline data set of apparently uninfected birds was found to be positive.

He is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams, including Gerald Davies, Gareth Edwards, JPR Williams, Ryan Jones, Gethin Jenkins and Alun Wyn Jones. Career Jones began his career with Neath before switching to the Ospreys with the regionalisation of Welsh rugby in 2003. Following several successful seasons at club level, Jones received a call up to the Wales squad in 2003, making his debut as a replacement against England during the 2003 Six Nations. Jones almost immediately pinned down the No.3 shirt and was selected for Wales' World Cup squad at the end of 2003. He featured in all of Wales' games at the tournament, starting in the crucial group games against Italy and New Zealand and the quarter final loss to England. At the time, fears over Jones' fitness led to him only playing the first half of games, a trend that he emphatically ended as his career developed. Jones continued to hold down the starting tighthead spot through the 2004 Six Nations and autumn Internationals. In 2005, Jones was a key member of the Welsh Grand Slam- winning side, starting all five of Wales' games en route to their historic achievement, it was alongside Gethin Jenkins that he provided a platform for the side in 2005. Jones was a solid presence during the 2006 Six Nations, and was also one of the senior squad members for Wales' summer tour to Argentina. Following a difficult tournament for Wales in the 2007 Six Nations, Jones was selected for his second World Cup in the autumn of 2007. In that year's World Cup Jones played in the group stage against Canada and Australia, but was dropped in favour of Worcester's Chris Horsman for the crucial final group game against Fiji. Bouncing back from the disappointment of the World Cup, Jones played in four of Wales' games on their way to the Grand Slam in the 2008 Six Nations. In his early career Jones was often criticised for a lack of scrummaging power, but he has answered those critics with several seasons of dogged and dependable work in the front row of both Wales and the Ospreys. He developed the ability to scrum very low, and to manipulate his weight positioning, in order to drive the loosehead's head towards his left knee. Jones' improvement under the guidance of Warren Gatland saw him selected for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa and he made the squad for the first Test in Durban. After shoring up the Lions' retreating scrum in the first Test, Jones started the narrow second Test loss to South Africa in Pretoria. In June 2009 Gethin Jenkins, Jones and Matthew Rees were selected as the British and Irish Lions front row for the 2nd Test against South Africa. This was the first time an all-Welsh front row was selected for a Lions test match since Billy Williams, Bryn Meredith and Courtney Meredith on the 1955 Lions tour. Jones was sent home after the 2nd test match with South Africa in which they lost 28‚Äì25 after dislocating his right shoulder. Jones was sidelined for six months with the injury and had surgery on torn shoulder ligaments. During the two Tests, Jones was on the field for 81 minutes, during which the British Lions scored 30 points and conceded 15. In his absence, the Lions scored 16 points and conceded 39. His effort was ended by a dislocated shoulder suffered during the game after a challenge from Springboks lock Bakkies Botha and he was ruled out of the third Test. Jones' shoulder injury came after Botha attempted to clear him from a ruck and the Bulls star was subsequently cited and banned for two weeks for the challenge. Jones was ruled out for six weeks with the injury, returning for the Ospreys at Christmas in 2009 and for Wales ahead of the 2010 Six Nations. Jones is well known for his front row partnership at the Ospreys and Wales with Duncan Jones (no relation). Together, they are affectionately known as the \\"Hair Bears\\", because of their recognisable hairdos. In the May 2010 edition of Rugby World, it was reported he has 'slimmed down' to a 'svelte' 19 stones by cutting out junk food, beer and gaining focus in training. In January 2011 the Ospreys prop was injured in the first half of the region's Heineken Cup loss to London Irish and scans confirmed ligament damage and a lay-off of eight weeks. He returned to the Wales squad for their final Six Nations match against France. In August 2011 Jones was named in the 30-man squad for the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. The Welsh team performed admirably, reaching the semi-finals. Jones played a vital role in providing a platform for Wales' exciting backs to score many tries. He played against South Africa, Samoa, Fiji and Ireland before injuring his calf within the first 10 minutes of the semi-final against France. He returned to full fitness in December 2011, and did enough to earn selection for Wales' 35-man squad for the training camp in Poland prior to the 2012 Six Nations. He was part of the 37-man squad for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. After the 2013‚Äì14 season, Jones left the Ospreys, refusing to sign a new contract until a dispute between the Welsh regions and the WRU was resolved. On 19 August 2014, he was unveiled as a new signing by Cardiff Blues. On 24 January 2015, Jones announced his retirement from international rugby. On 26 March 2015, it was announced that Jones would join Aviva Premiership side Harlequins from the 2015‚Äì16 season. Jones played for Harlequins until the end of the 2017-18 season, increasingly moving from playing to coaching during that time. Notably, on 8 October 2016, Jones was called-up to the bench as a very late replacement for the game against Northampton Saints. Following a very early injury in the game Jones ended-up having to play nearly the whole match at loosehead, to considerable praise. Jones announced his complete retirement from the game on 25 March 2018, effective from the end of the 2017-18 season.

(p. 183) Part of the above quote has often been used as an evidence of Arab responsibility for the Palestinian exodus in 1948. In the June 16, 1961, The Spectator, Leo Kohn, professor of political science at Hebrew University and an ambassador-rank adviser to the Israeli Foreign Office used it to support his contention that: > There is also a wealth of evidence from Arab sources to show that the Arab > League at an early stage of the campaign adopted a policy of evacuating the > Arab population to the neighbouring countries, being convinced that their > absence would be of short duration and would facilitate the impending > military operations. ... However, Edward Atiyah came forward to contest this interpretation. In a letter in The Spectator of 23 June 1961, he wrote in a first comment that the passage quoted by Kohn omitted the next sentence: \\"But it was also, and in many parts of the country, largely due to a policy of deliberate terrorism and eviction followed by Jewish commanders in the area they occupied, and reaching its peak of brutality in the massacre of Deir Yassin.‚Äù Having thus referred back to what in his book he considered to be two partial reasons for the exodus, Atiyah then continued, however, in his second comment, to state that there is '\\"no suggestion whatever in what I wrote that the exodus of the Arab refugees was a result of a policy of evacuating the Arab population. What I said is something quite different from the Zionist allegation that the Arab refugees were ordered or even told by their leaders to evacuate, [...]\\" Atiyah died in 1964 at the age of 61 while taking part in a debate on Arab- Israeli relations at the Oxford Union.The Times, obituary, 26 October 1964.

Selznick's film, which did not go into production until the following year. Academy Award was a CBS radio anthology series which presented 30-minute adaptations of plays, novels or films. The program's title is listed in one source as Academy Award Theater.Terrace, Vincent. (1999). Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 8. Rather than adaptations of Oscar-winning films, as the title implied, the series offered \\"Hollywood's finest, the great picture plays, the great actors and actresses, techniques and skills, chosen from the honor roll of those who have won or been nominated for the famous golden Oscar of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\\" With that as a guideline, any drama could be presented as long as the cast included at least one Oscar- nominated performer. For example, Robert Nathan's 1940 novel Portrait of Jennie was not released as a film until 1949. David O. Selznick, having acquired the rights to Nathan's novel in 1944, was spending much time and money in his efforts to bring it to the screen. Thus, Academy Award's December 4, 1946, adaptation of Portrait of Jennie, with John Lund and Oscar-winner Joan Fontaine, had a promotional aspect, concluding with host/announcer Hugh Brundage revealing, \\"Portrait of Jennie is soon to be a Selznick International picture starring Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten.\\" The program initially aired on Saturdays at 7pm(et) through June, then moved to Wednesdays at 10pm(et). Frank Wilson scripted the 30-minute adaptations for producer- director Dee Englebach, and Leith Stevens provided the music. Frank Wilson was the script writer. The sound effects crew included Gene Twombly, Jay Roth, Clark Casey and Berne Surrey. The series began March 30, 1946, with Bette Davis, Anne Revere and Fay Bainter in Jezebel. On that first show, Jean Hersholt spoke as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, welcoming the E.R. Squibb & Sons pharmaceutical company {\\"The House Of Squibb\\"} as the program's sponsor. It was an expensive show to produce since the stars cost $4000 a week, and another $1,600 went each week to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the use of their name in the show's title. This eventually became a factor in Squibb's decision to cancel the series after only 39 weeks. Dramas in which actors recreated their original film roles included Henry Fonda in Young Mr. Lincoln, Humphrey Bogart in The Maltese Falcon, Cary Grant in Suspicion, Gregory Peck in The Keys of the Kingdom and Ronald Colman in Lost Horizon. However, of the 39 episodes, only six actors recreated their own Oscar-winning roles: Fay Bainter, Bette Davis, Paul Lukas, Victor McLaglen, Paul Muni and Ginger Rogers. The series ended December 18, 1946, with Margaret O'Brien and one of the series' frequent supporting players, Jeff Chandler (appearing under his real name, Ira Grossel) in Lost Angel.

With the advent of regional rugby in Wales, Horsman was called up to the Celtic Warriors regional side, but when the club was disbanded due to financial difficulties in 2004 he was forced to seek another club. Horsman signed for Worcester in July 2004 and established himself as one of the best props in the English game. He signed a contract extension at the beginning of 2006 to keep him at Sixways until the summer of 2010 but in July 2009 he announced his retirement after a series of injuries. International career He was offered a place in the England national rugby union team, but two separate bouts with cancer prevented him from playing for England. However, he later chose to play for Wales as he qualified through the three-year international residency rule. Horsman made his full Welsh debut on 11 November 2005 against Fiji at the Millennium Stadium. He scored his first and only try against England at the Millennium Stadium on 17 March 2007 and he was selected for the Wales squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He attained a total of 14 international caps for Wales. Refereeing and coaching Following his retirement as a player, he announced his intentions to begin training as a referee. Horsman has also pursued a coaching career within the Welsh setup, as head coach of RGC 1404 from 2012 to 2014, and subsequent appointments within Wales' age-grade teams. In 2018, Horsman coached the Wales national under-20 rugby union team. Personal life In 1997, Horsman was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which was successfully treated at the Royal Marsden hospital in Sutton, London; only for him to later succumb to a strain of lymphatic cancer. The second occurrence of this cancer was also treated successfully and Horsman returned to rugby.

As such, it was influential in the careers of, for example, Jackson C. Frank, Al Stewart, Marc Brierley, Davey Graham, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, Sandy Denny, John Martyn, Alexis Korner, The Strawbs, Roy Harper, The Young Tradition and Paul Simon.

Previously, he was Executive Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences (2008-2012) at Rutgers. In the past, he served as a Professor of History at the University of Southern California, Executive Director of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, and President of the Chicago Historical Society. Biography Greenberg's professional career in history began with a bachelor's degree with Highest Honors in History in 1969 from Rutgers University. This was soon followed up with a master's degree as well as a Ph.D in History from Cornell University in 1971 and 1974, respectively. In the early 1980s, Greenberg taught and served as a dean at Princeton University. Simultaneously, he was chair of the New Jersey Historical Commission. In 1986, he left Princeton to become Vice President of the American Council of Learned Societies. Though his studies trained him as an historian in early American history, Greenberg's own studies prepared him for his career in public history in general. In 1993, Greenberg went to the Chicago Historical Society, where he became President and CEO. During Greenberg's tenure, he oversaw several exhibitions and documentaries on the history of Chicago, which included its first online exhibition, The Great Chicago Fire and the Web of Memory. He also focused resources on advancing the technology used at the Historical Society, including developing a website that included public access catalogs and digitized materials of many kinds. In 2000, Greenberg became the Executive Director and CEO of Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, the organization founded by Steven Spielberg to document on video the testimonies of survivors of the Holocaust. While at the Shoah Foundation, Greenberg negotiated the agreement that made the Foundation part of the University of Southern California. He also oversaw the complete indexing of 52,000 testimonies, initiated a comparable project to collect testimonies of survivors of the Rwandan genocide, and greatly expanded the scholarly reach of the Foundation, whose name was changes to USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. While serving as Executive Director of the Institute, he was also Professor of History at USC. He assumed the Executive Dean's position in the School of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers in 2008. In 2012, he returned to the classroom and taught courses in American Legal History and the History of the Holocaust and Genocide. He retired from Rutgers in 2016. Over the course of his career, Greenberg published widely on early American history, public history, and the impact of technology on scholarship and libraries. He also received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. He served widely on non-profit boards including those of the American Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, and the Research Libraries Group. While living in California, he was Chair of the California Council on the Humanities. After returning to New Jersey in 2008, he became Chair of the New Jersey Humanities Council. He currently serves as Chair of the Development and Governance Committee of Maryland Humanities.

The Irish name is Brugh/Br√∫ Thuinne meaning Great House of the Pastureland. Churchtown is within the Cork North-West D√°il constituency.  Etymology  According to the Journal of the Ivernian Society, Churchtown is a translation of Baile an Teampuill, the former ecclesiastical name of the parish which had replaced the non- ecclesiastical Br√∫ Thuinne ‚Äì the ‚ÄòRoyal House of the Pasture Lands‚Äô. The name of the parish, Br√∫ Thuinne, has been the subject of much debate. Some scholars suggest that it is Br√∫gh, ‚Äòa habitation‚Äô. Patrick Weston Joyce defines Br√∫gh as ‚Äòa mansion‚Äô. Reverend Canon J.F. Lynch states: ‚ÄòBruhenny is a diminutive form of Bruach, border or edge, and it is named Brochoyn and Bruchhane in the Pipe Roll of Cloyne.‚Äô Others have identified the parish as ‚Äòthe marshy part of Orrery in County Cork‚Äô, leading to speculation that part of the name may have been derived from the genitive of the common word Tonn, meaning 'low-lying or pasture land'.  History  The area that now comprises the parish of Churchtown was settled at least 4,000 years ago. A Bronze Age axe head discovered in the parish is evidence of such settlement. Much of the village, which consisted primarily of thatched houses, was burned by the Whiteboys in January 1822 during an attack on the police barracks. Lord Egmont‚Äôs agent, Sir Edward Tierney, commenced the rebuilding of Churchtown in 1825 and the work continued until its completion in 1849. The village was built in the form of a square, one side of which was named Egmont Row. The main street was George‚Äôs Street and that running west was named Kerry Lane. The double row of houses on the Buttevant Road was called Chapel Lane, while the road to the east leading to the main Cork‚ÄìLimerick road was named Lodge Road (now Burton Road).  Education  The first school in Churchtown was built from an endowment by Sir John Perceval in 1702. The dissolution of the school in 1720 was largely brought about by the reluctance of parents to ‚Äòbind‚Äô the children to the Master of the school rather than to tradesmen. A later grammar school at Burton was also a failure. The original Churchtown National School on Kerry Lane was built by Sir Edward Tierney and completed in 1847. Later the school was moved to another building and this building was turned into a community center. It is the only school in the parish. As of 2005, the school had an attendance of forty girls and boys.  Ecology  A wide variety of flora and fauna grow in the parish. Ballygrace and Stack‚Äôs Bridge are considered areas of particular ecological value. Recorded varieties of trees common to the parish include: apple, crab apple, ash, alder, beech, cedar, chestnut, cypress, elm, fir, hazel, holly, larch, lime, monkey puzzle, oak, pear, pine, spruce, sycamore, willow and yew. Fauna includes the badger, fox, hare, shrew, red squirrel, stoat and bat. Birds include the goldcrest, sparrow hawk, kestrel and barn owl, as well as all other common songbirds.  Events  The Churchtown Carnival was a week-long annual fund-raising festival begun in the late 1940s under the guidance of Muintir na T√≠re. The carnival was a very important part of the town's culture and was still being held till the 1970s. The event was advertised in surrounding parishes on loudspeaker and was held at the community center.

Copley has also published a biography of Thomas Arnold in which he challenged T. W.

Copley was a significant Christian educationist who argues that a process of secular indoctrination is occurring in British society in which vocal secularists are using the media to exclude religion from the public square. By contrast, Copley argues for religious values to be instilled in young people through state-maintained schooling.

Fantastic Four Adventures is sold once every 28 days through newsagents, although a subscription offer is available. Fantastic Four Adventures retailed at ¬£2.40 upon its release, but rising in printing costs have seen the price rise to ¬£2.50 and then onto the current price of ¬£2.95.

Format Fantastic Four Adventures has 76 pages of which there is a contents page on the inside cover and a letters page on the inside back cover, named the \\"Fantastic Forum\\". It features very few advertisements, normally 4 of the 76 pages, which is very few compared to the American comics it reprints. All the advertisements are for Marvel-related merchandise. So far, only the first issue is the only one published to be extended to 100 pages. The cover is made out of a thick card unlike the US comics which is made of normal glossy paper. The printing work is of high quality. It currently reprints modern (about two years old) Fantastic Four comics as two of its three 22-page stories. The 3rd story is a 'classic' story, a story originally printed in the 1960s. Currently it is reprinting the original Fantastic Four stories by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby that established the characters from issue 1, but ended with 'The Thing No More', first printed within Fantastic Four #78.

Content It began by printing stories by Carlos Pacheco and the run by Mark Waid and the late Mike Wieringo, but last printed Mark Millar's and Jonathan Hickman's individual runs on Fantastic Four. It has also printed the Thing miniseries Freakshow, Reed Richards Before the Fantastic Four, as well as Fantastic Four: The End. The comic magazine ended with the final arc of 'Three', the story that depicted the death of Johnny Storm, and a story entitled 'Uncles', originally printed in issue #588 of the US publication of Fantastic Four. Readers will be unable to read the tales by Hickman depicting the aftermath of Johnny Storm's death which results in the formation of the FF featuring Spider-man, or The Human Torch's return, due to the cancellation of the publication. However, the Spider-man arc entitled 'Fantastic Voyage' will feature in 'Astonishing Spider-man' #67-68, published by Panini.

Before the introduction of the KTX express trains, the Saemaeul-ho was the fastest class of trains in South Korea, making the journey from Seoul to Busan in less than 5 hours. Saemaeul trains operated on several lines, but they now only operate on the Janghang Line. Saemaeul-ho trains are distinguished from the more basic Mugunghwa-ho trains by their larger and comfortable seats and the absence of standing passengers. Trains are also distinguished from the Mugunghwa-ho trains by their colour; typical Saemaeul train passenger cars are painted in red and black. In the past, Saemaeul passenger cars were painted in green, blue, and yellow. The length of a Saemaeul train varies from 5 cars to 12 cars, either as one or two sets; certain Saemaeul-ho trains that ran from Seoul to Busan separated at Gupo Station, with one half travelling along the Bujeon Line and Donghae Nambu Line to Haeundae, and the travelling down the main Gyeongbu Line to Busan Station. The Saemaeul-ho took its name from the Saemaul Undong, a movement for rural revitalization spearheaded by Park Chung-hee in the 1970s. Saemaeul-ho train of DHC-PP DMU cars with a new Korail paint scheme (since retired). New ITX- Saemaeul train The Saemaeul-ho class was phased out on all lines except the Janghang Line by the ITX-Saemaeul starting on May 12, 2014. The new ITX- Saemaeul trains have a faster average speed of 150 kilometers per hour, and replaced the older Saemaeul trains gradually until April 30, 2018.

In early 1975, Daewoo Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., which was preparing for the development of high-class domestic passenger cars, supplied 2 units, which were successfully developed and manufactured in the design based on Japan imported Saemaul coach cars. From 1979 to 1982, it was distributed to Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hyundai Precision Industries. Welded research steel plate, mild steel material, the wall is designed to be rectangular. The guest room garden was usually 56 seats and was the seat of a typical Japanese limited train style. The armrests had the same color as the seat, and the reclining angle was so great that it would hinder the backseat. There were no calves or braces. The initial painting was based on ivory color, and consisted of a window line and a blue band at the lower end of the carriage. It was similar to the Japanese Shinkansen 0 system. In addition, the NT-21 bogie of the disc braking type was applied for the high-speed driving at the beginning, and the air spring bogie was applied to the 10 pieces of the special passenger car made in Hyundai Precision in 1982. There was a standard room, a dining room car, a separate room car, a restaurant combination room special carHalf of the room / Half called the restaurant as a so-called halter. and a prospective coach car. A rectangular car was operated by the Saemaul Arirang Yoram train, which was operated on December 31, 2007, We all retired. = Streamlined carriage = The second- generation train was introduced with the 7000-train locomotive from 1986 to 1988. The length of the car was increased from 21m to 23.5m and the seat was increased to 64 seats. To make the seat more spacious. One of the differences compared to the first-generation passenger car is that the existing spring cushion is replaced with a cotton cushion, an armrest is added to the center, and a folding table is installed on both ends of the armrest. In addition, automatic cabin door which existed only in a rectangular cabin was applied to all rooms, and the automatic door was installed for the first time in Korea. Indirect lighting was adopted for the first time, and individual reading lights were installed. However, due to differences in service quality with long - haul carriages, streamlined carriages were downgraded to full - size cabins in Mugunghwa in 1993, and were then downgraded to ordinary rooms.This carriage is called \\"old mugunghwa\\" in the meaning of \\"old cabin for special rooms\\". Since 1996, he has begun to renovate a streamlined carriage with headrests and legless seats.It was the same as the seat of Tongil Hall or Mugunghwa Privileged Train In the process of retrofitting, all backrests without headrests have disappeared, but the replacement of heat sinks for heating is not possible.Even some of the carriages remodeled the backrest with the lower body untouched. There was a LED signboard inside the room together with the same type of Saemaulho which was produced and introduced in 1988 but it was temporarily incompatible with the same type Saemaulho which was produced and introduced in 1992, The publisher was changed to be compatible with the production and introduction vehicles of 1992. = Long carriage = It was introduced from 1990 to 1999, and it is a new type of cabin that the room facilities were changed greatly compared to the previous vehicles. It raised the service space of washrooms and toilets to a considerable level, and provided instantaneous coolers, water heaters and drinking water. Since then, there has been room for the installation of mobile public telephones. The bathroom had no opaque glass windows (completely closed with no windows), and the entrance door was the same as the room interior. The seat was transformed from a conventional brown sheet to a purple sheet with a luxurious pattern, and a LED signboard was placed on the door of the room to display various information as captions. He also operated a smoking room. In 1991, the carriage was installed and installed on the outside of the door. 45-seater coach cars also appeared and operated on the Gyeongbu Line.The seating arrangement was a 2x1 configuration. Compared to the more spacious seats, the legrest is equipped with exactly what was used in the 2x2 arrangement, which is somewhat uncomfortable for the actual ride. Since 1991, they were no longer producing or introducing them. The body was the same as the stainless steel bodywork of the Saemaul Autonomous Vehicle. The painting was the first painting of the Saemaul Autumn Vehicle with a red line on the window. The letters on the LED display board in the car were greenish-green, with a unique font, and the letter size accounted for two-thirds of the display board.Originally, the size of the character window of the electronic signboard was designed accordingly. In the process of unification with the coloring of Korean railway, both of the carriage type and the homogeneous type were replaced with a relatively ordinary one and disappeared. An electric water heater was installed in the washroom in the service area, but water temperature was freely controlled. On December 3, 1999, a fire caused by a short circuit in Noryangjin Station resulted in the burning of one car (524) in the early 2000s. . The bathroom shelf was originally a sink and flower arrangement, which was demolished due to administrative difficulties. On the opposite side of the sink, a portable wireless public telephone operated by Korea Mobile Communications, which was piloted in 1994 and expanded to all vehicles in 1995, was installed, and personal phones were rapidly spread and demolished in the 2000s. At present, there is a button-type drinking water bottle with a disposable paper cup at the place where there is an air pressure gauge and a trash can, In the 2000s,It was removed from the new Mugunghwa coach car which was built and introduced from 1994 to 1995, which borrowed the same design as the Saemaulho service space. all LED devices were demolished and video broadcasting equipment (KOMONET) was installed in the car-shaped Saemaul rivers. In February 2008, due to the condition of broadcasting companies, broadcasting was suspended and the middle monitor was removed. And it became ineffective.  Suite carriage  Special-sized carriages have the same specifications as regular rooms, except that the capacity is 60 persons. In addition to the number of seats, the illumination of the individual lighting can be adjusted, the installation of personal audio equipment by the program, and the retractable legrest (calf rest) existed. Among the suites, a 2x1 arrayed passenger carriage also operated. All doors are automatic doors from the beginning of the introduction, and are equipped with a non-acid washroom and a restroom. In addition, various tourist trains operate in the form of collecting fares and fees for the Saemaeul Special Zone, and use vehicles such as the Mugunghwa Hana Nuri, or the small-lorry and commuter-type diesel vehicles. = Remodeled carriage = In January 2013, Korail have remodeled the remaining coasters after the demolition of the Saemaul-type diesel hydraulic car. Since 1992, the specification is almost the same as the large Saemaeulho. Conventional streamlined and long-haul carriages have no jumper lines in the same vehicle type, so it was impossible to operate them by homogeneous knitting. On the contrary, these coaches were not able to operate as coaches that were connected to locomotives. Therefore, remodeling work was done to connect with locomotive and mix with existing carriage. = Mugunghwa-ho remodeled carriage = Since the durability of streamline passenger cars and convertible passenger coaches has expired at the end of April 30, 2018, except for the vehicles modified to the Mugunghwa Special Passenger Units and the three cars introduced in 1999, they will be operated from May 1, 2018 . The Limit carriage of Mugunghwa coaches was remodeled and the same color scheme as ITX-Saemaul was adopted. The seating capacity is 72 seats, and each seat has a 220V outlet and a USB charging terminal.  Related culture  = Social status = Until the first KTX rating was established on April 1, 2004, the Saemaeulho was responsible for the highest grade train, and the Saemaulho had a very high social status. Especially in the early 1960s and 1970s, it was recognized that VIPs or wealthy people were trains on the train. = Restaurant Car = In 1969, at the time of the introduction of the tourism lake, the dining car was operated under the name \\"SALON\\".The Kwan-Gwang Ho is not the first dining car in Korea. It was first run by the Korean National Railroad, and in 1986, the outsourcing commissioned privatization of the outskirts, and the Seoul Plaza Hotel was operated by the Saemaeul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho restaurants until March 31, 2004. Until the end of the 1990s, all the Saemaeulho (plus some Mugunghwa) except for some weekend trains were connected to the dining car. However, in 1999, since the restaurant was removed from the Saemaul rivers in Janghang, . In the 2000s, some non-mealtime trains operated the Lotteria in the dining room car instead of the dining room.Due to the nature of the train operation, the complaints of the passengers were not disrupted and the deficit was increased. From July 2003, the Seoul Plaza Hotel returned the diner car operation of the train at the non-meal time, As a consortium.Lunchbell Co., Ltd., which operated a dining car until the restaurant car was reorganized into a caf√© carriage, was the company that operated the dining car. There were one chef,From the beginning of the dining car to early 1994, and from early 2001 to early 2004. In the middle of the gap period, all the menus were cooked in the same manner as the airplane meals in order to improve the quality of the food in the train dining room, and then it was not necessary to have a chef since it was provided to the microwave oven .Then, in early 2001, he reorganized the train restaurant in the name of Plaza Express. He was able to cook again on the train and provided him with a menu, which served him for several years before he left the train restaurant business. one manager, and one or two servingHowever, in the case of the production of some semi-trailer vehicles such as Seoul- Janghang, Cheongryangri-Andong, the waiter was also a one-person sales system that serves food alone and in-car sales. In addition, the number of menus to be sold in comparison with other train restaurants was small, because the vehicle of this antitheft response type was often attached to a short distance or a train with low demand. on the dining car. The chef supervised the cooking, the manager supervised the cash register, and the staff in charge of the service performed the service in the dining room and sold the lunch box or the room moving room. In the car, they sold lunch boxes,The lunch box sold at the Saemaulho restaurant was used as a lunch box of Hanwha Hotel & Resort. The Plaza Hotel itself is a Hanwha Group affiliate, and the restaurant business division, which served as a train restaurant business, was separated into Hanwha Development as a subsidiary. Western food,In the early days when plaza Hotel passed the goodwill, there were many food-oriented menus, and there were some form menus that were unfamiliar in Korea and easy to handle in the dining car. Korean food,Beginning with the goodwill of the Seoul Plaza Hotel in the early 1990s, it began to appear one by one, starting with the roasted meats. liquorBeer, Korean wine, and Baekseju were the main focus. In the 2000s, standard-style whiskey such as Passport, which was not treated well by other brand-name whiskeys, was also on the menu under the name of premium whiskey. Many problems have been pointed out, such as high prices compared to the quality of trains operated on trains, the problem of detecting E. coli that was reported to the press if forgotten, and the use of factory products containing retort and cans in some menus such as curry rice. Since April 1, 2004, KTX was opened and the number of passengers using the dining room was reduced, and Seoul Plaza Hotel returned the operating rights of the dining car to run the lunch bar. Although the dining car stopped operating on trains except for some meals for about two years immediately after the opening of KTX, the restaurant car was connected to all trains again from 2006. However, as most of the Saemaulng visitors were using KTX, the number of passengers in the dining room naturally decreased. In 2008, the dining car was abolished and reorganized into a train cafe. Train cafes sell lunches, sandwiches, confectionery, drinks, liquors and soups. There are cell phone rapid chargers, game machines and computers,Internet PCs have been removed from most trains due to the low usage rate due to the spread of smartphones. mini concert rooms and therapy rooms.Karaoke equipment was installed in the mini concert room, massage chair was installed in the therapy room. The utilization rate is also low, and it has been long since it has been reduced to a space complex. On May 7th, 2012, KORAIL Tourism Development Co., Ltd. introduced rail lock, which is a train-only lunch box, and sold the rail lock instead of the existing lunch box in Saemaeul-ho train cafe.

Louis Coatalen joined Sunbeam as chief engineer in 1909, having previously been Chief Engineer at the Humber company works in Coventry. The company quickly became one of the UK's leading engine manufacturers and even designed an aircraft of its own. Sunbeam discontinued the production of aircraft engines after Coatalen left the company in the 1930s.  Crusader engine  In the autumn of 1912, Coatalen designed a V8 engine, which delivered 120 hp at 2500 rpm. It was called the Crusader and was announced in the British aviation press in March 1913. Aircraft manufacturers welcomed this, as no really suitable British engines were available at the time. The company procured a French Farman biplane in which to test the new engine, and also hired a full- time test pilot for the project. This was John Alcock, who later became well known for his famous non-stop Atlantic flight with Arthur Brown. The test flights began in the middle of October 1913, and took place at Brooklands. In December of that year, the aircraft began a long period of intensive flight tests, which ranged over most of southern England and continued until the outbreak of War in 1914.  Zulu engine  The Zulu was developed during 1915. It was identical to the Crusader, except that the bore was increased from 90 mm to 100 mm and the reduction gear ratio was changed, allowing the engine to develop 160 hp at 2000 rpm. The Zulu engine was used in some Coastal Airships.  Mohawk engine  Coatalen's next engine was an enlarged Crusader and was called the Mohawk. The Mohawk was a V12, side-valve engine, and (like the Crusader) was initially built with an 80 mm bore, which was soon increased to 90 mm. With its initial bore it developed 200 hp, when enlarged to 90 mm, it developed 225 hp and became known as the Sunbeam 225. Short seaplanes using this engine were often called \\"225s\\" because of this. The engine had two poppet side valves per cylinder, was water-cooled, weighed 905 lb dry, had four Claudel-Hobson carburettors, and two ignition magnetos.  Gurkha engine  A Sunbeam Gurkha in the remains of a Short Type 184 at the Fleet Air Arm Museum. While Frederick Rutland's aeroplane survived the First World War intact, it was damaged by bombing during the Second World War. The Gurkha was developed as a replacement for the Mohawk and was of identical design, except that the bore was increased from to and the reduction gearing was reduced from 2:1 to 1.86:1. This allowed the engine to develop 240 hp at 2000 rpm. Production ended in October 1916, after 74 units had been supplied to power the Short Type 184 seaplanes of the Royal Naval Air Service. The Gurkha engine preserved at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, Yeovilton, Somerset, England, is the only surviving Sunbeam side-valve engine in the world. It is installed in the Short 184, aircraft number 8359, that played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland at the end of May 1916.

The documentary is a search for the severed hands of the Latin American guerrilla fighter Ernesto Che Guevara. After Guevara's execution in Bolivia in 1967, his hands were severed from his body for purposes of identification. After fingerprints were taken, the hands, and Guevara's body, disappeared. In 1997 the body was found buried under a landing strip in Vallegrande, Bolivia. Guevara's hands were not found in the grave, and it is not clear what became of them after his death, although some accounts indicate they were sent to Cuba by Antonio Arguedas. The film attempts to answer the question of their location. There is also a book of the same title. It is called Las Manos de Guevara (The Hands of Che Guevara), written by Evgenii Dolmatovskii.

It organises the first division, second division leagues and a cup competition.  Before the Federation's establishment  Volleyball first made its appearance in Cyprus in the 1920s and was first included as a competitive event in the 1928 Pancyprian Games. After the World War II it was played a lot at schools and a Student Championship was established. The Local Committee of SEGAS Cyprus (SEGAS is the sports governing body of Greece) was founded in 1947 and established annual championships between the Gymnastic Clubs and then between those clubs that had a volleyball section. A representative team of Cyprus was invited in 1953 in Egypt to play against Greek and Egyptian teams of Cairo and Alexandria. On November 23, 1966, the Local Committee of Cypriot Athletes was established by 15 sport clubs as a local federation of the Greek one. In 1971, the first championship took place and APOEL became the Champions. As Winners of a championship which was run by a local committee, APOEL were represented in the Greek National First Division in 1972/73 and in 1973/74 the Cypriot Champions Anorthosis Famagusta. However, Cypriot teams stop taking place in the Greek Championship after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.  The establishment and afterwards The sport, which was originally governed by the Greek Sports federation until 1978, became a separate entity, when the Cyprus Volleyball Federation (CVF) was established. The following clubs were the founding members of the CVF: AEL Limassol, Anagennisis Deryneia, Anorthosis, APOEL, Apollon Limassol, APOP Paphos, Aris Polemi, Achaeon Akti Gialoussas, Achilleas Kaimakli, E.N.P. Paralimni, Marathon Kato Varosha, Nea Salamis Famagusta, Olympiakos Nicosia, Olympias Neapolis, Olympias Frenaros, Omonia Nicosia, Omonoia Xylotympou, Pezoporikos Larnaca, Phoenix Pyla, EPA Larnaca. The CVF is a member of F√©d√©ration Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) and of Conf√©d√©ration Europ√©enne de Volleyball (CEV) and is responsible for representing Cyprus on the international Volleyball stage. Its headquarters are in Nicosia. Currently the C.V.F. has 25 active clubs, fielding 23 teams in the men's and women's senior competitions, plus as many as 60 teams in junior and youth events. The CVF currently runs the First and Second Division Championships and Cups for both men and women and several junior competitions. The honored teams of First Division Championships and Cups represent Cyprus in European competitions. Also the Federation is responsible for all the national teams in men and women.  Beach Volleyball in Cyprus  The Beach Volley has occurred in Cyprus for the first time on the beaches of Famagusta where you gather the best volleyballers of the island mainly from Famagusta and Nicosia. Tournaments were held daily between athletes and the sport became very popular but was not through the Federation. The Federation with the foundation in 1978 made several studies and tournaments started being organized by the Federation regional tournament on men and women (5X5, 3X3, 2X2 and 4X4 mixed) and then island-wide since 1987. Slowly began to be upgraded over the years with the last few years have not been anything to envy from other volleyball leagues developed countries. In 1993 on the initiative of former international volleyballer Anorthosis Christos Angelides, the company H & C Hotels Ltd and the Federation hosted the first unofficial international tournament ever held in Cyprus in the name of Protaras Open in 1996 and renamed Odessa International. In 1996 CY.V.F. upgraded the championship tournament over Cyprus and the institution was established. The 2000 championship was given to the company \\"Events One\\" for five (5) years and since 2006 the Federation reorganizes the tournaments in new and better bases. The Beach Volley tournament involving the best Cypriot Volleyballers surrogate partners, members of the Nat. Volleyball Teams and more, so the interest is increased and the fan turnout is any time beyond the most optimistic expectations. In 2005 Cypriot athletes participated for the first time in tournament games Small States of Europe. Due to the increased interest Beach Volley receive high visibility from the media and broadcast live the final phase. The games are played on weekends from morning until night during July and August to beach volleyball courts that now exist in all towns of Cyprus. During this period there are four (4) beach volleyball tournaments held for men and two (2) for women. The growth of Cyprus beach volleyball can be shown by organising the Cyprus FIVB Challenger 2006 made the Tourist Beach Geroskipou and crowned with complete success. 67 teams participated from 22 countries with prize money of $ 60 000. Paramount importance for the spread of the sport, but also the promotion of Cyprus was the third edition of the World University Championship held at the City Sports Facilities of Paralimni. Every year in Yeroskipou a major event held by CEV or FIVB has been made. Meanwhile the women's national team of Cyprus has made a lot of successful showings (gold medal in GSSE, silver medal in the European u21 tournament, 7th place in Mediterranean Games, etc.) while the men's team accepted the gold medal in GSSE, the bronze medal in the CEV Satellite challenger in Yeroskipou in 2010, and the 7th position in the Mediterranean Games. Three consecutive times the Cypriot women Manolina Constantinou and Mariotta Angelopoulou have won the Greek series, which shows that the Cypriot team is one of the best in Panhellenic. From the above, the perceived high activity of the Cyprus Volleyball Federation and the efforts for further progress in our sport.

Broadcasters and telecommunications companies frequently produce coverage maps to indicate to users the station's intended service area. Coverage depends on several factors, such as orography (i.e. mountains) and buildings, technology, radio frequency and perhaps most importantly for two-way telecommunications the sensitivity and transmit efficiency of the consumer equipment. Some frequencies provide better regional coverage, while other frequencies penetrate better through obstacles, such as buildings in cities. The ability of a mobile phone to connect to a base station depends on the strength of the signal. That may be boosted by higher power transmissions, better antennas, taller antenna masts or alternative solutions like in-building picocells. Normal Macro-Cell signals need to be boosted to pass through buildings, which is a particular problem designing networks for large metropolitan areas with modern skyscrapers, hence the current drive for small cells and micro and pico cells. Signals also do not travel deep underground, so specialized transmission solutions are used to deliver mobile phone coverage into areas such as underground parking garages and subway trains.  Coverage noticer  A coverage noticer is a device that beeps (or vibrates) when in a zone that lacks coverage (white spot). This is fundamental for critical services (security, emergency and so on). When the user goes to a covered area, the noticer ceases beeping. Similarly coverage maps are often used to visualize coverage, these are produced by networks themselves as well as independent companies. Coverage noticers can be integrated in a mobile phone also and several apps exist to show coverage maps on devices, including 'Coverage?', OpenSignal, and Sensorly.

He was made emperor in 554 after his older brother Emperor Fei was deposed by the paramount general Yuwen Tai. He carried little actual power, and in 556, after Yuwen Tai's death, Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu, serving as guardian to Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue, forced Emperor Gong to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and starting Northern Zhou. The former emperor was killed in 557. Because Northern Wei's other branch successor state, Eastern Wei, had fallen in 550, Emperor Gong can be regarded as Northern Wei's final emperor as well. Background Yuan Kuo was born in 537, as the fourth son of Emperor Wen. His mother's name is not recorded in history. In 548, Emperor Wen created him the Prince of Qi. However, nothing else is known about his activities during his father's reign, during which the paramount general Yuwen Tai largely controlled power. Yuwen's hold on power appeared to be even firmer after Emperor Wen died in 551 and was succeeded by Yuan Kuo's older brother Yuan Qin (as Emperor Fei). During Yuan Kuo's stint as the Prince of Qi, he married the daughter of the general Ruogan Hui () as his wife and princess. In 554, Emperor Fei, angry over Yuwen Tai's execution of the official Yuan Lie () in 553, plotted to have Yuwen killed. However, the news was leaked, and Yuwen deposed him. He selected Yuan Kuo to succeed Emperor Fei (as Emperor Gong). Contemporaneously, Yuwen changed the imperial clan's surname from Yuan back to Tuoba, reversing the change that Emperor Xiaowen ordered in 496. Reign Emperor Gong appeared to be even more powerless than his father and brother, and the power remained in Yuwen's hands. He created his wife, Princess Ruogan, empress. Later in 554, Yuwen poisoned the deposed Emperor Fei to death. Later that year, an army dispatched by Yuwen and commanded by Yu Jin () captured rival Liang Dynasty's capital Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), capturing and executing Liang's Emperor Yuan. In spring 555, Emperor Gong created Xiao Cha, a nephew of Emperor Yuan, the Emperor of Liang (as Emperor Xuan), but Xiao Cha was not recognized by most of Liang generals and officials, who instead recognized Xiao Yuanming, a candidate supported by Northern Qi, as emperor. (Xiao Cha's state is known as the Western Liang in history.) Later in 555, Yuwen required Tuoba Yu () the Prince of Huai'an to submit to Emperor Gong a proposal to have the imperial princes reduced in rank to dukes, of which Emperor Gong approved. In spring 556, pursuant to Yuwen's desire to reorganize the governmental structure in accordance with the Zhou Dynasty governmental structure, the imperial government was reorganized into six departments. In fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the northern provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (ÁâΩÂ±ØÂ±±, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned his nephew Yuwen Hu to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and Yuwen Tai's 14-year- old son Yuwen Jue took over his titles, while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state. Emperor Gong was subsequently forced to create Yuwen Jue the greater title of Duke of Zhou. In spring 557, Yuwen Hu, believing that Yuwen Jue's youth meant that he needed to take imperial title to affirm his authority, forced Emperor Gong to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and starting Northern Zhou. Death Yuwen Jue (Emperor Xiaomin) initially created Tuoba Kuo the Duke of Song. However, less than two months after Tuoba Kuo yielded the throne, he was killed. His wife, the former Empress Ruogan, became a Buddhist nun.

After James Burbage and Philip Henslowe, Langley was the third significant entrepreneurial figure active at the height of the development of English Renaissance theatre.F. E. Halliday A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964. Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 273.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespearean Stage 1574‚Äì1642, Third edition, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; pp. 42‚Äì5 and ff. Background Langley was a goldsmith by profession, and also held the office of \\"Alnager and Searcher of Cloth\\" ‚Äì he was an official quality inspector of fabric. His brother-in-law was a clerk for the Privy Council; Langley had been appointed to his Alnager's post through a recommendation from Sir Francis Walsingham. Langley became involved in theatre in the mid-1590s, and operated much as Henslowe did,E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 1, p. 368 n. 3. contracting individual actors and troupes to work exclusively for him, and serving as their reliable creditor. Langley, however, did not leave the relatively abundant documentary record that Henslowe did; his affairs are much more mysterious and difficult to untangle. Swan Theatre Swan Theatre, 1616. Langley's central achievement in Elizabethan drama was the building of the Swan Theatre in Southwark, on the south shore of the River Thames across from the City of London, in 1595‚Äì96.Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 411‚Äì14.Halliday, p. 481. The Swan was the fourth large public playhouse in London, after Burbage's The Theatre (1576), Lanman's Curtain (1577) and Henslowe's Rose (1587) ‚Äì though the Swan was in its time the most well-appointed and visually striking of the four. Langley had purchased the Manor of Paris Garden as early as May 1589, for the sum of ¬£850. (Paris Garden was a \\"liberty,\\" at the extreme western end of the Bankside district of Southwark. The Manor in question had been part of the monastery of Bermondsey, which, like all such establishments in England, had passed into private hands after Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. In November 1594, the Lord Mayor of London complained to Lord Burghley about Langley's plans to build another theatre on the Bankside.Chambers, Vol 4, pp. 316‚Äì17. The Rose and the Beargarden, the bear- baiting ring, were already located there. The Lord Mayor's protest had no discernible effect; the Swan was certainly ready by February 1597, when Langley signed a contract with Pembroke's Men to play at his new theatre. Their contract mentions that the theatre had already been in use for plays, which points to activity in the summer of 1596. The playing company involved is not named; but given Shakespeare's odd connection with Langley (see below), it might have been the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Shakespeare and dispute with Gardiner Langley also had an unknown connection with William Shakespeare. In November 1596 two writs of attachment, similar to modern restraining orders, were issued to the sheriff of Surrey, the shire in which Southwark is located. First, Langley took out a writ against two parties named William Gardiner and William Wayte; William Wayte then took out a writ against William Shakespeare, Langley, and two women named Anne Lee and Dorothy Soer. William Gardiner was a corrupt Surrey justice of the peace. Leslie Hotson describes Gardiner's life as a tissue of \\"greed, usury, fraud, cruelty and perjury\\". Shortly before these events he had brought charges of slander against Langley, for having accused him of perjury. Langley defended himself robustly, insisting that the accusation was true and he could prove it in court. Gardiner dropped the charges. William Wayte was Gardiner's stepson, described in another document as \\"a certain loose person of no reckoning or value being wholly under the rule and commandment of said Gardiner\\".Leslie Hoson, Shakespeare versus Swallow, 1931, p. 24-30. 1596 Michaelmas term court order entry of a petition for sureties of the peace by William Wayte against William Shakespeare, Francis Langley, and others. Shakespeare's role in this dispute is unclear. Anne Lee and Dorothy Soer, the two women named with Shakespeare in the second writ, cannot be identified. Hotson assumes they worked at the theatre in a support capacity. Shakespeare may have been connected with Langley through the Pembroke's Men, with whom he probably worked in the early 1590s, since they played at least two of his earliest works, Titus Andronicus and Henry VI, Part 3; his later company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, may have acted a season at the Swan in the summer of 1596. He appears to have been living in the area at the time. Hotson argues that a dispute of some sort between Langley and Gardiner probably escalated after Gardiner's bluff was called over the slander charges. He believes that Gardiner took his revenge by threatening Langley's theatre interests, persecuting \\"Langley and Shakespeare and his fellow actors at the Swan\\" with the support of Puritan opponents of the theatre. This may have involved threats to destroy the theatre itself, since Gardiner obtained an order to demolish Langley's theatre some months after the writs were issued, though the order was soon rescinded. The luckless Wayte, as Gardiner's agent, would have been on the receiving end of the backlash from supporters of the theatre, probably leading to altercations of some sort. The feud ended with Gardiner's death in November 1597. The Isle of Dogs If there was a period of good business in the spring and summer of 1597, it definitely did not last: in July came the scandal centred on Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson's play The Isle of Dogs. On 28 July the Privy Council, angered by what it termed \\"very seditious and scandalous matter\\" in that play, ordered all the London theatres shut down for the remainder of the summer. When the prohibition on the other theatres was lifted in the autumn, it was kept on Langley's Swan, dealing his theatre business a serious blow. Langley was in trouble with the authorities over another matter as well, a stolen diamond that he had fenced or attempted to fence; and this may well have been an additional reason for the suppression of his theatre. Five of the actors in Pembroke's Men, now out of work, defected to the Admiral's Men, and apparently took some of the company's playscripts with them. Langley sued them, though the outcome of the case is unclear from the surviving records.Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 131‚Äì3. It seems likely that Langley reached some kind of resolution with Henslowe, for the actors remained with their new company. Langley's position at this time could not have been a strong one. The remnant of the Pembroke's Men company, perhaps with some replacement members, was touring outside London in 1598‚Äì99, in Bath, Bristol, Dover, and other towns. Boar's Head His harsh experience with the Swan Theatre did not entirely sour Langley on the business of drama. The Boar's Head Inn, outside the City of London's medieval walls on the northeast, had long been a venue for play-acting in previous decades; it was converted to a theatre in 1598 by a partnership between Oliver Woodliffe and Richard Samwell. In November of that year, however, Langley bought Woodliffe's share in the concern. The original conversion proved unsatisfactory, and a major reconstruction was launched in 1599. At the same time the litigious Langley launched a series of lawsuits against Samwell concerning the costs of refitting the theatre ‚Äì a legal campaign that ended with Langley's death early in 1602.Gurr, pp. 139‚Äì40. However, the Boar's Head never succeeded as a theatre, and the project failed after 1604. Death and legacy After Langley's own death in January 1602, his Paris Garden estate was sold. His theatre lived on after him, hosting miscellaneous events ‚Äì fencing contests, boxing matches, stage-magic spectacles ‚Äì and eventually becoming a venue for drama once again; the Lady Elizabeth's Men played at the Swan in the 1611‚Äì13 period. They acted Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside there in 1613. Eventually the place fell into disrepair; a 1632 pamphlet refers to the building as \\"fallen to decay, and like a dying swan hanging down her head, seemed to sing her own dirge.\\" References Category:Theatre in England Category:1548 births Category:1602 deaths Category:English goldsmiths Category:16th-century English people Category:17th-century English people Category:Theatre people from London ","title":"Francis Langley"},{"id":"7691782","text":"Sponvika is a village in Halden municipality, Norway.

Three important aspects of context are: where you are; who you are with; and what resources are nearby. Although location is a primary capability, location- aware does not necessarily capture things of interest that are mobile or changing. Context-aware in contrast is used more generally to include nearby people, devices, lighting, noise level, network availability, and even the social situation, e.g., whether you are with your family or a friend from school.  History  The concept emerged from ubiquitous computing research at Xerox PARC and elsewhere in the early 1990s. The term 'context-aware' was first used by Schilit and Theimer in their 1994 paper Disseminating Active Map Information to Mobile Hosts where they describe a model of computing in which users interact with many different mobile and stationary computers and classify a context-aware systems as one that can adapt according to its location of use, the collection of nearby people and objects, as well as the changes to those objects over time over the course of the day.

Many of his publications appeared as volumes of the Hakluyt Society. He played a major role in assisting the presentation of the historical aspects during the quadricentennial celebrations (1984‚Äì1987) of the first establishment a colony at Roanoke Island. Quinn was born in Dublin, Ireland and was the single pupil at his first school. He graduated from Queen's University, Belfast in 1931. He then completed a PhD on the early Tudor administration in Ireland at King's College London. He subsequently spent five years as lecturer at University College, Southampton (now Southampton University). Returning Belfast in 1939 he taught Irish history. He became interested in the voyages of discovery made by Humphrey Gilbert. At that time historians relied uncritically on the works of Richard Hakluyt published around 1600. Quinn's work and the new sources he discovered resulted in his first volume for the Hakluyt Society, and marked the beginning of his seminal work on voyages of exploration, which he developed from 1944 at University College, Swansea. In 1957 he moved to Liverpool University. At the instigation of America's Four Hundredth Anniversary Committee his Set Fair for Roanoke: Voyages and Colonies, 1584‚Äì1590 was published by University of North Carolina Press in 1985. He died in Liverpool, England on 19 March 2002.

Its population is 1,382. Larkollen was the landfall on the main route between Oslo (then called Christiania) and Copenhagen for several centuries. The lee side of the islands Sletter, Eld√∏ya, and Kollen south and west of Larkollen was an easily accessible harbor in all kinds of wind, which also was easy to defend. Sometime in the early 19th century the landfall was moved north to Jel√∏ya outside of Moss. In the early 20th century Larkollen, which today is known as a sleepy suburb for Moss, became a prime summer destination for well-to-do families from Oslo and Fredrikstad. The summer houses built by these families still dominate the coastline and the islands at Larkollen. From then until about 1980, two summer hotels operated in Larkollen. In 2010 only one hotel remains, which was torn down. A new one is called the St√∏tvig hotel after the valley that lies near there. Anthon B. Nilsen, a wealthy sawmill owner from Fredrikstad, is credited with being the first of many summer guests in Larkollen. He built his summer house just north of Larkollen in the 1880s, just after the railroad was opened between Christiania and Fredrikstad, with a station at nearby Dilling. Anthon B. Nilsen was a story-teller and author, who published his work under the pseudonym \\"Elias Kr√¶mmer\\". His arrival to Larkollen started the development of the summer destination Larkollen, and many of the large summer houses were built in the period up to 1920. The Nilsen family is still represented in Larkollen, both as permanent residents and summer guests. Larkollen is a coastal landscape with water washed rocks, coves and small wooded hills, and an open and beautiful cultural landscape just behind the coastal line. A moraine from the last ice age surfaces on the coast of the island Kollen in the north and follows the shoreline south of R√∏rvik to the island/peninsula Danmark on the northern side of the Kure fjord. The terrain of Kollen and Danmark and part of the beaches are dominated by large sand- and waterscoured moraine rocks that have been moved by the glaciers. On Kollen, El√∏en and the Sletter islands to the south, volcanic rock comes up to the surface, as a rhomb porphyric conglomerate, part of the unique Oslo graben. Erosion of this conglomerate due to sea and waves gives rise to the sandy beaches found on these islands. Geologically these islands belong to the western side of the Oslofjord, with a major geological fault between the islands and the east side of the fjord. Here is the St√∏tvig valley with forests on each side of a good agricultural landscape. Within the area you will find some oak groves. Outside Larkollen are islands Kollen and Eld√∏ya (also called El√∏en). The coastal village Larkollen, whose name probably is connected with the island Kollen's name, started to grow early in the 18th century. Larkollen has a good port with a safe harbor, so pilots, customs, skippers, in-keepers and craftsmen settled down here. On the island Eld√∏ya a settlement was established including an inn, which according to tradition today still stands after being moved to a location north in Larkollen in the 19th century. Several other old houses in Larkollen were moved from Eld√∏ya to the northern part of Larkollen. Today only one of the original buildings remains on El√∏en. Larkollen became an important port, and a fortification was built here in 1711 overlooking the harbor and with wide views. The Customs Station from 1749, was in operation (also with a lot of activity during prohibition) up to June 1960 when activity and personnel were moved to Moss. The Customs station has been turned into a summer house for employees in the Customs Authority. The 500 year-round inhabitants from 1960 have grown to almost 1500 in 2010, while the number of summer guests estimated by locals in 1960 to 2500 has fallen substantially in the same period. Growth in the number of people using the popular camping site at Teibern has compensated somewhat for the reduction in cabin/house-based summer guests. Ancient farms in Larkollen are St√∏tvik and Saltbohuset. Newer, medieval farms are Ammundr√∏d, Tollefsr√∏d, Grefsr√∏d, Buberg and Botner. A 9-year-old's life on the island Kollen in the post-WW2 year 1945-46 has been described in an autobiographic children's book by Astrid Karlsen Scott, \\"Little House on the Fjord\\", published by Nordic Adventures Inc. in 2004. Larkollen in early 19th century has been described in 5 handcolored prints by John W. Edy, an Englishman who traveled widely in Norway and made a large number of prints from those times.

Many of the stories by Elias Kr√¶mmer take place in Larkollen. Larkollen is hometown of Marianne Ihlen, known as the subject of Leonard Cohen's song \\"So Long, Marianne\\". Norwegian royalty have visited Larkollen several times, on private visits. King Olav often sailed his 8mR \\"Sira\\" from Hank√∏ on day trips to Larkollen and back in later years. John Forbes Kerry, democratic candidate in the US Presidential Election in 2004, visited Larkollen several times as a teenager in the years from 1959‚Äì62, when his family lived in Oslo.

The leaves are compound pinnate, with 5‚Äì17 alternately arranged leaflets. The flowers are fragrant, white or pink, produced in racemes or panicles 15‚Äì40 cm long. The fruit is a pod 3‚Äì8 cm long, containing one to six seeds. Cladrastis is related to the genus Maackia, from which it differs in having the buds concealed in the leaf base, and in the leaflets being arranged alternately on the leaf rachis, not in opposite pairs. The genus name derives from the Greek klados, branch, and thraustos, fragile, referring to the brittle nature of the twigs. The combination of Cladrastis, Pickeringia and Styphnolobium form a monophyletic clade known as the Cladrastis clade; as the other two originated from within Cladrastis, Cladrastis is paraphyletic.

Launched as the 2-litre, it only later became known as the SA, the car had been originally planned as an advanced performance saloon to rival the likes of SS Cars (later to be known as Jaguar) and even Bentley with all independent suspension and was given the factory code of EX150 and designated the S-type. A prototype was made but with the amalgamation of MG with Morris Motors in 1935, development stopped. The Cowley drawing office picked up the project again but a much more conservative car appeared with conventional live rear and beam front axles. The car used a tuned version of the six-cylinder Morris QPHG engine which it shared with the Wolseley Super Six but enlarged to . The capacity was increased again to in 1937 bringing it into line with the Wolseley 18. This was a tall engine and to allow the bonnet line to be as low as possible the twin SU carburettors had their dashpots mounted horizontally. Drive was to the live rear axle via a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top two ratios (on all but a few early models). Wire wheels were fitted and the drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system. A built in Jackall jacking system was fitted to the chassis. The saloon body, the only option available at the time of the car's launch, was made in-house by Morris and was a spacious four door with traditional MG grille flanked by two large chrome plated headlights. The spare wheel was carried on the boot lid. Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat at the rear, all with leather covering. Much use was made of walnut for the dashboard and other trim items. A Philco radio was offered as an optional extra for 18 Guineas (GBP18.90). From April 1936, a Tickford drophead coup√© by Salmons joined the range priced at GBP398, the saloon was GBP375, and in July, coachbuilders Charlesworth offered a four-door tourer at GBP375. The tourer originally had straight topped doors but these were replaced with front ones with cutaway tops from 1938 and at the same time the spare wheel moved to the front wing. Of the 2739 cars made, 350 were exported with Germany proving the best market. At the 1938 London Motor show, alongside an SA there was a new 2.6-litre car, the WA. This was probably designed to be a replacement but both cars ran in parallel until the outbreak of war in 1939 caused production of both to cease. Neither was re-introduced in 1945.

The name of the device is derived from the fact that the clitoral stimulator looks like a pair of rabbit ears. The first rabbit vibrator appeared on the market in 1984 and, along with the magic wand vibrator, is considered by Cosmopolitan magazine to be one of the classic sex toys. Their popularity was boosted in the United States after an episode of HBO's Sex and the City (\\"The Turtle and the Hare\\") featured Vibratex's Rabbit Pearl. The rabbit was chosen for the show because it was a bestseller at a store in New York. Rabbit vibrators are designed to give more intense sensations than the more traditional dildo or clitoral stimulator, by providing simultaneous vaginal and clitoral stimulation. The Rabbit Pearl, the original device, also had a rotating section. Since then the rabbit vibrator has evolved and become a whole genre of sex toys with many different brands and variations in design including ones with a less phallic shape or without the rotating beads section. The device can be used in a variety of ways and for both solo sexual play and during partnered sex. History Company owner Shay Martin says Vibratex was the first company to import dual-action vibrators to the United States in 1983. Carina Hsieh and Natasha Burton, Cosmopolitan, Jun 30, 2020, History of the Rabbit These vibrators were imported from Japan and were manufactured in bright colours and shaped to look like beavers, kangaroos and turtles to get around the country‚Äôs obscenity laws, unlike previous imports from China that had been designed to resemble a realistic phallus. Martin credits their colouring and cuteness as making them more appealing to women and leading to the market success of the Rabbit. Designers at Vibratex had been working on a new version that added rotating pearls to the base of the shaft of the dual-action vibrators. In 1984 the Rabbit Pearl was released. From 1985 onwards Rabbit Pearl imitators flooded the market including Susan Colvin‚Äôs Jack Rabbit for adult magazine company CPLC and the Rampant Rabbit for the UK sex toy party company Ann Summers.  Materials  Normally rabbit vibrators are made out of a jelly-like substance (polyvinyl chloride), silicone (semi-organic polymer), rubber (elastic hydrocarbon polymer) or latex (natural rubber) materials. Silicone vibrators are easier to clean and care for, since this material is not porous, therefore no bacteria or foreign matter is absorbed by the toy. Silicone retains heat and has no odour. Jelly material is porous and cannot be sterilised in boiling water and has a scent of rubber that some find unappealing. In order to escape this smell some producers aromatise the products with more pleasurable scents. Rabbit vibrators made from vinyl, plastic, metal, and elastomer materials can be also found. They are much less porous than jelly, or entirely non-porous, but the texture is smooth and firm.  Use and pleasure  Rabbit vibrators are designed for simultaneous internal (vaginal) and external (clitoral) stimulation. The rabbit-shaped stimulator is held near the clitoris, while the shaft is taken into the vagina, offering deep, \\"all around\\" stimulation. Most models offer a choice of shaft rotation speeds and patterns of clitoral stimulation. While using a rabbit vibrator, users may benefit from using additional lubrication, as jelly can absorb the body's natural lubrication, and both jelly and silicone create friction against skin. Lack of moisture may cause irritation, discomfort or pain.  Commentary  The rabbit vibrator has been described as \\"one of the most visible contemporary signs of active female sexuality\\".ATTWOOD, F. (2005). Fashion and passion: marketing sex to women. Sexualities, 8(4), 392-406. The appeal of the rabbit vibrator is its ability to give clitoral and vaginal stimulation at the same time.Pelling, R. (2006, Sep 24).

Although similar to physiognomy and phrenology, the term \\"criminal anthropology\\" is generally reserved for the works of the Italian school of criminology of the late 19th century (Cesare Lombroso, Enrico Ferri, Raffaele Garofalo and Lorenzo Tenchini). Lombroso thought that criminals were born with detectable inferior physiological differences. He popularized the notion of \\"born criminal\\" and thought that criminality was a case of atavism or hereditary disposition. His central idea was to locate crime completely within the individual and divorce it from surrounding social conditions and structures. A founder of the Positivist school of criminology, Lombroso opposed the social positivism developed by the Chicago school and environmental criminology. History  The Italian school   Mugshot and fingerprinting  On the other hand, Alphonse Bertillon (1853-1914) created a mugshot identification system for criminals prior to the invention of fingerprinting. Hans Gross (1847-1915), leading worker in the field of criminology was also involved in the development of the theory.Anthropological Criminology, North Carolina Wesleyan College, retrieved from here on March 10, 2007  Social Darwinism  The theory of anthropological criminology was influenced heavily by the ideas of Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882). However, the influences came mainly from philosophy derived from Darwin's theory of evolution, specifically that some species were morally superior to others. This idea was in fact spawned by Social Darwinism, but nevertheless formed a critical part of anthropological criminology. The work of Cesare Lombroso was continued by Social Darwinists in the United States between 1881 and 1911. The theory In the 19th century, Cesare Lombroso and his followers, performed autopsies on criminals and declared that they had discovered similarities between the physiologies of the bodies and those of \\"primitive humans\\" such as monkeys and apes. Most of these similarities involved receding foreheads, height, head shape, and size: Lombroso postulated the theory of the 'born criminal' based on these physical characteristics. Moreover, he also declared that the female offender was worse than the male, as they had distinct masculine characteristics. Lombroso outlined 14 physiognomic characteristics which he and his followers believed to be common in all criminals, some of which were (but are not limited to): unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances (bumps) on head, in back of head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos on body; receding hairline; bumps on head, particularly above left ear; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets, but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders, but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes. Lombroso published several works regarding his work, L'Uomo Delinquente, L'Homme Criminel (The Criminal Man), The Female Offender (original titled Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman) and Criminal Man, According to the Classification of Cesare Lombroso. Rejection During Lombroso's life, British scientist Charles Buckman Goring (1870-1919) was also working in the same area, and concluded that there were no noticeable physiological differences between law-abiding people and criminals. Maurice Parmelee, seen as the founder of modern criminology in America, also began to reject the theory of anthropological criminology in 1911, which led to its eventual withdrawal from the field of accepted criminological research. Modern times Despite general rejection of Lombroso's theories, anthropological criminology still finds a place of sort in modern criminal profiling. Historically (particularly in the 1930s) criminal anthropology had been associated somewhat with eugenics as the idea of a physiological flaw in the human race was often associated with plans to remove such flaws. This was found particularly in America, with the American Eugenics Movement between 1907 and 1939, and the Anti-miscegenation laws, and also in Germany during the Third Reich where 250,000 mentally disabled Germans were killed. Criminal anthropology, and the closely related study of Physiognomy, have also found their way into studies of social psychology and forensic psychology. Studies into the nature of twins also combines aspects of criminal anthropology, as some studies reveal that identical twins share a likelihood of criminal activities more so than non-identical twins. Lombroso's theories are also found in studies of Galvanic skin response and XYY chromosome syndrome.

He is principally known for his work on the origin and nature of itinerant ferromagnetism (the type of ferromagnetic behaviour associated with pure transition metals like cobalt, nickel, and iron), including the collective electron theory of ferromagnetism and the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. Biography Stoner was born in Esher, Surrey, the son of cricketer Arthur Hallett Stoner. He won a scholarship to Bolton School (1911‚Äì1918) and then attended University of Cambridge in 1918, graduating in 1921. After graduation, he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory on the absorption of X-rays by matter and electron energy levels; his 1924 paper on this subject prefigured the Pauli exclusion principle. Stoner was appointed a Lecturer in the Department of Physics at the University of Leeds in 1932, becoming Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1939. Starting in 1938, he developed the collective electron theory of ferromagnetism. From 1951 to 1963, he held the Cavendish Chair of Physics. He retired in 1963. He did some early work in astrophysics and independently computed the (Chandrasekhar) limit for the mass of a white dwarf one year before Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1931. Stoner calculation was based on earlier work from Wilhelm Anderson on the Fermi gas and on earlier observations of Ralph H. Fowler on white dwarfs. Stoner also derived a pressure‚Äìdensity equation of state for the stars in 1932. These equations were also previously published by the Soviet physicist Yakov Frenkel in 1928. However Frenkel's work was ignored by the astronomical community. Stoner had been diagnosed with diabetes in 1919. He controlled it with diet until 1927, when insulin treatment became available. Stoner model of ferromagnetism A schematic band structure for the Stoner model of ferromagnetism. An exchange interaction has split the energy of states with different spins, and states near the Fermi level are spin-polarized. Electron bands can spontaneously split into up and down spins. This happens if the relative gain in exchange interaction (the interaction of electrons via the Pauli exclusion principle) is larger than the loss in kinetic energy. : \\\\epsilon_{\\\\uparrow} (k) = \\\\epsilon_0 (k) - I \\\\frac{n_{\\\\uparrow}-n_{\\\\downarrow}}{n} : \\\\epsilon_{\\\\downarrow} (k) = \\\\epsilon_0 (k) + I \\\\frac{n_\\\\uparrow-n_{\\\\downarrow}}{n} where \\\\epsilon_0 (k) is the energy of the metal before exchange effects are included, \\\\epsilon_{\\\\uparrow} and \\\\epsilon_{\\\\downarrow} are the energies of the spin up and down electron bands respectively. The Stoner parameter which is a measure of the strength of the exchange correlation is denoted I, the number of electrons is n = n_{\\\\uparrow} + n_{\\\\downarrow} . Finally, k is the wavenumber as the electrons bands are in wavenumber-space. If more electrons favour one of the states, this will create ferromagnetism. The electrons obey Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics so when the above formulas are summed over all k-space, the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism can be established.

After his mother died two years later, he went back to Newfane to live with his grandparents and complete his schooling. In 1807, he moved back to Stukely Township in Lower Canada. Knowlton settled on Brome Lake in Brome Township where he established a farm, general store and distillery. In 1830, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Shefford County. Knowlton voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions.Journals of the House of Assembly of Lower Canada, from the 7th January to the 18th March, 1834 p. 337 He helped set up the Shefford County Agricultural Society and served as president. In 1834, he set up a sawmill in a new location and added a store and gristmill; this was to become the site of a new settlement called Coldbrook, later known as Knowlton. Knowlton helped organize the local resistance against the Lower Canada Rebellion and was named lieutenant-colonel in the local militia. He was named to the Special Council that then administered the province by colonial administrator Sir John Colborne. In 1841, he was named to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada. He signed the 1849 Montreal Annexation Manifesto proposing union with the United States, viewing this as the best way to ensure the future economic development of the region. He served as first warden for Brome County and was first president of the county agricultural society. He helped establish the Advertiser and Eastern Townships Sentinel with Lucius Seth Huntington in 1856. He died in Knowlton in 1863.

Synopsis  The leader of the country, called Pharaoh (who is plagued by voices), declares war upon society's 'undesirables'. Drug abusers, refugees, criminals and the homeless are all considered equally worthless and entered into a restricted ghetto, called 'Dreamland' (set in a then dilapidated fun fair of that name, since restored), where they cannot leave. When Moses learns he was adopted by Pharaoh and is actually the son of an asylum seeker, he shuns his life of privilege to lead the ghetto's inhabitants in a revolt against his father. A series of 'plagues' echoing the biblical story attack the inhabitants of the 'promised land' including algal blooms which turn the sea red (like the first plague of turning the River Nile to blood) and a computer virus (possibly a modern reworking of the sickness in live stock plague). The plagues are treated as acts of terrorism by those in the promised land and violent reprisals are sought against those in Dreamland.

J. Bowen, Joe Swanberg, Barbara Crampton and Rob Moran. The plot concerns an estranged family under attack by a group of masked assailants during a family reunion. The film had its world premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival Midnight Madness program and was theatrically released on August 23, 2013, in the United States. The film grossed over $26 million from a $1 million production budget and has since gained a cult following. Plot A woman named Erin accompanies her boyfriend, Crispian Davison, to his family reunion at their vacation home in rural Missouri. Present are Crispian's parents Aubrey and Paul, Crispian's older brother Drake and his wife Kelly, Crispian's younger siblings Felix and Aimee, and their partners, Zee and Tariq, respectively. During dinner that night, someone shoots crossbow bolts through the window, killing Tariq and wounding Drake. The survivors discover that cell phone reception in the area has been jammed. Aimee runs outside for help, but runs into a garrote wire which slices her throat, killing her. Paul brings a disheartened Aubrey to her bedroom upstairs; when Paul leaves, Fox Mask appears from under the bed with a machete and Aubrey screams. The rest of the family rushes upstairs and finds Aubrey dead with the words \\"You're Next\\" in blood on the wall. Erin texts 911 and searches for potential weapons. Tiger Mask attacks her through a window, but she escapes by stabbing his hand. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed. She panics and runs to the neighboring home; it is revealed that it belonged to a murdered couple from the beginning of the film. She is attacked by Lamb Mask while trying to gain entry, falls inside, and is killed. At the original house, Crispian leaves the house in an attempt to fetch the car, only to discover that the car's wiring has been tampered with. He returns to the house to alert the others; he then decides to leave and look for help, despite Erin's pleas. Tiger Mask attempts to kill Erin with an axe but she manages to kill him first. Paul finds sleeping bags and food wrappers that indicate the killers have been staying in the house for some time. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask kills him. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins Tom (Fox Mask), Craig (Lamb Mask), and Dave (Tiger Mask) to murder the family so they could collect their inheritance. Lamb Mask finds Tiger Mask's corpse and flips the dinner table over in rage. He discovers a wounded Drake hiding there, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. Unaware of the scheme, Erin helps Zee set up nail traps. Erin explains that she grew up in a survivalist compound where she learned combat and survival skills. Felix lures Drake to the basement and kills him. On the upper floor, Erin comes across Paul's body. She jumps through a window to escape Fox Mask, injuring her leg in the process. She narrowly avoids being shot by Lamb Mask and returns to the house. Lamb Mask follows her, but while entering the house, injures himself on one of Erin's nail traps. While hiding, Erin overhears an argument between Felix, Zee, Fox Mask, and Lamb Mask, who reveals that Tiger Mask was his brother. Her cell phone beeps to indicate that her text to 911 has gone through, alerting the killers. Erin flees the house again but is unable to run with her wounded leg, so reenters through a window and conceals herself nearby. When Lamb Mask attempts to enter through the same window, she ambushes and kills him. Realizing she cannot outrun Fox Mask with a wounded leg, Erin sets up a trap at the front door. Fox Mask enters the house through a window, so Erin ambushes and kills him in the basement. Zee and Felix attempt to kill Erin themselves. Felix stabs Erin, but she kills him using an inverted blender, then uses his knife to kill Zee. Felix's cell phone rings and Erin answers without speaking. Believing he is speaking to Felix, Crispian apologizes for fleeing instead of helping, revealing he was in on the murders. He returns to the home and finds Erin, who confronts him. Crispian explains to Erin that she was never meant to be targeted. After he attempts to bribe her into staying quiet, she kills him in disgust. A police officer arrives and shoots Erin in the shoulder, having seen her kill Crispian. After calling for backup, he attempts to enter the house despite Erin's pleas, and accidentally becomes the target of Erin's front door trap that was intended for Fox Mask.

From there, Barrett wrote a script inspired by Agatha Christie mysteries as well as a combination of screwball comedies and chamber mysteries. Barrett would later note that Bay of Blood was probably in the back of his mind when writing the film, although he only realized this after the fact. Wingard credited the film's humor to Barrett's sense of humor and cynicism. Some of the dinner conversations were improvised and based on real-life experiences the filmmakers had with family members. =Filming= The film was shot in 2011 at a mansion in Columbia, Missouri.

Kurt Osenlund of Slant Magazine gave the film 4 stars, stating the film \\"brazenly merges the home-invasion thriller with the dysfunctional family dramedy\\". Joshua Rothkopf (Time Out New York) called the film \\"solidly satisfying\\" and a \\"minor triumph\\", although he commented that the film was, in general, unoriginal. Matt Glasby of Total Film called the film \\"funny and tense, rather than hilarious and terrifying\\", and complimented the film for being a \\"good\\" horror-comedy. Barbara VanDenburgh (Arizona Republic) gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating the film was not \\"very scary\\" and that its \\"budget for red food coloring was no doubt higher than the one for script doctoring\\", although she complimented the film's score and \\"gruesome\\" conclusion. Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post said the movie \\"is at times bloodily entertaining.

Parsons Jr. (1844 ‚Äì February 3, 1923) was an American landscape architect. He is remembered as being a founder of the American Society of Landscape Architects, helping to establish the profession, as well as the accidental introduction of the fungus that led to the near extinction of the formerly widespread American chestnut tree.Jabr, Ferris. \\"A New Generation of American Chestnut Trees May Redefine America's Forests.\\" Scientific American, March 1, 2014. Retrieved September 22, 2015. Early years Samuel Bowne Parsons Jr. was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1844 to Samuel Bowne Parsons Sr. who himself was the son of Samuel Parsons, who moved to Flushing from Manhattan around 1800 and married Mary Bowne. Samuel Bowne Parsons Sr. was an accomplished and well noted horticulturist, who was the first to import Japanese Maples and propagate rhododendrons. Samuel received his practical training and knowledge of landscaping and landscape materials working for J.R. Trumpy, the manager of his father‚Äôs nursery in Flushing, Queens. Parsons then went to school at Yale University and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy in 1862, after which he spent several years studying and practicing farming. When he returned home to the family nursery, it had started supplying Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, two famous designers responsible for the Greensward Plan for New York City's Central Park. The site of the nursery is within present-day Kissena Park, and Parsons Boulevard, which runs through much of the family nursery's land, is named after him.  Projects  Parsons became Vaux's apprentice from 1879‚Äì1884 and his partner from 1887-1895. When Vaux became the head landscape architect of the New York City Parks Department, with him came Parsons, who took over the unpaid position of Superintendent of Planting. After Vaux's death in 1895, Parsons became the new head landscape architect of New York City and remained there until 1911. During Parsons' partnership with Vaux, the two produced many notable designs, including Abingdon Square and Christopher Street Park, both in Greenwich Village; the restoration of the Ladies Pond in Central Park, which at the time was infested with malaria carrying mosquitos; the siting of Grant's Tomb in Riverside Parkl and the completion of Morningside Park. In collaboration with architect Stanford White, Parsons and Vaux also produced the Washington Memorial Arch in Washington Square Park and the Grand Army Plaza Arch near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Throughout their tenure together Parsons noticed that Vaux was a very passionate believer in naturalistic parks, but was reluctant to push himself forward. After Vaux‚Äôs death, Parsons went on to design Balboa Park (then known as City Park) in San Diego, Albemarle Park in Asheville, North Carolina, St. Nicholas Park in New York City, a Dutch Garden for Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, and a redesign of Union Square to accommodate a new subway station. New York City was the main beneficiary of Parsons' designs; they included numerous bathrooms, some designed to resemble Greek temples. In 1899, Parsons founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in conjunction with ten other well established practitioners on a basis of three tenets: #To establish landscape architecture as a recognized profession in North America. #To develop educational studies in landscape architecture. #To provide a voice of authority in the \\"New Profession\\". From 1905 to 1907 Parsons served as the President of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Parsons published numerous magazine articles and at least six books on landscape gardening throughout his life. He depended on media publicity to accomplish a goal only once; he sought help from local newspapers to help rid Central Park of shantytowns. Throughout his professional career, Parsons was known for his ability to merge elegant plantings and the extensive knowledge he had gained from his father with the native environment without disrupting the Genius Loci (the spirit of place) of the sites he designed. He was able to maintain his design characteristics in all of his design projects without completely copying his earlier work. He remains a founding father of the modern day landscape architecture institution, and his designs are still visible throughout the United States, primarily in San Diego‚Äôs Balboa Park and New York City's Union Square. Pinelawn Memorial Park Parsons' most notable designs outside of New York City are Balboa Park in San Diego, California and Pine Lawn Cemetery on Long Island. American Chestnut Tree American chestnuts Before the early 1900s one in every four hardwood trees in North America's eastern forests was an American chestnut. Together with oaks they predominated in 80 million hectares of forest from Maine to Florida and west to the Ohio Valley, reaching heights of up to and growing two meters around the middle. Chestnuts sometimes piled so high on the forest floor that people would scoop them up with shovels. Both humans and a wide variety of animals relied on this abundant and easily gathered resource for food, particularly in winter. Chestnut trees also had significant economic value. American carpenters preferred chestnut over other materials for making certain products. Lightweight, rot-resistant, straight- grained and easy to work with, chestnut wood was used to build houses, barns, telegraph poles, railroad ties, furniture and even musical instruments. In 1876 Samuel B. Parsons imported Japanese chestnut trees which he then sold to customers in several states across the country. Some of these shipments concealed the pathogenic fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. The disease chokes the trees to death by wedging itself into their trunks and obstructing conduits for water and nutrients. Asian chestnut trees evolved a resistance but their North American relatives were highly susceptible to chestnut blight. First discovered in New York State in 1904, the blight was soon spotted in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Within 50 years, C. parasitica killed nearly four billion chestnut trees. The species has been almost completely extirpated within its native range in one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in American history.

However, it was renamed Wyandra later in 1896. The town grew with the completion of the Western railway line from Charleville in 1897 and quickly became a centre for local grazing properties. The Wyandra Provisional School opened on 10 February 1898 and became Wyandra State School on 1 January 1909. In February 1921, the citizens of Wyandra erected a war memorial on the corner of Macks and Warrego Streets in honour of those residents of the district who served in the military during World War I. The memorial has a digger statue and lists the names of the 23 who enlisted and commemorates the three who died. A powerhouse was established in 1955 with generators that came from Cunnamulla.

It was designed by Gustav Brunner and, although tested and unveiled to the press in 1986, it never raced. Background Unhappy with the impending engine regulations in Formula One (which stipulated that the engine must be a V8 configuration), Enzo Ferrari commissioned the design of an IndyCar. He made no secret of his desire to win the Indianapolis 500; however, many believe that his threat to leave F1 for CART was merely a bargaining tool to make the FIA rethink their engine regulations. Ferrari approached Goodyear about the possible CART program, and Goodyear recommended the Truesports CART team for a research and development partnership. After the 1985 CART season, Truesports and driver Bobby Rahal traveled to Italy to demonstrate a March 85C-Cosworth. The car was tested by both Rahal and Ferrari driver Michele Alboreto at the Fiorano test track. Afterwards, the car was taken apart and studied by Ferrari. In 1986, Ferrari designed and built their own car, which was tested by Alboreto. Ultimately, this car was never raced as a Ferrari, but was passed on to fellow FIAT subsidiary Alfa Romeo, who were looking to improve their market share in the US. Technical For a car that was supposedly only a bargaining tool, the 637 was well engineered and carefully thought out. The upper body was made of aluminium, mechanically bonded and glued to the lower carbon frame. The Type 034 engine was a turbocharged 32-valve, 90-degree 2.65-litre V8, as per the CART regulations, which used upward mounted exhausts. When Alfa Romeo unveiled their (unrelated) 2.65-litre IndyCar engine, it was in the back of a March chassis; however it was seen testing at Fiorano Circuit in the 637 chassis.

He is known for vivid criticism of his political opponents, as well as figures from Montenegrin public life. Brkoviƒá was one of the founders and member of Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts, a parallel scholars' academy in Montenegro, disputed by the national Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts.CANU, clanovi Life He was born in the Seoca village near Podgorica, Zeta Banate, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Brkoviƒá worked as a journalist at the Radio Titograd and was an deputy editor of the magazine \\"Ovdje\\". Brkoviƒá spent his early life in Belgrade. In 1975 he was the recipient of the \\"13 July prize\\". While in Belgrade, Brkoviƒá promoted Serbian nationalism and supported Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. A romantic patriotic poet of the same league, he intimately befriended Matija Beƒákoviƒá and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá. During the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s he affected a pro-Montenegrin attitude and his views were sometimes described as being anti-Serbian. He was also a critic of the regime led by Milo ƒêukanoviƒá. In 1994, due to Djukanovic's pressure and political persecutions, Brkoviƒá left Montenegro for Croatia where he stayed under President Franjo Tuƒëman's protection. While in Croatia he studied the research of Saviƒá Markoviƒá ≈†tedimlija and Croatian historian Ivo Pilar. In 1999 he returned to Montenegro, when, in his words, \\"Montenegro once again became Montenegrin\\". He has since been a strong supporter of Montenegrin independence from the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. The same year Brkoviƒá became the founder and first president of the Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts, a controversial non-governmental cultural organization in Montenegro, dedicated to ≈†tedimlija's research of Montenegrins' original Red Croat identity and to proving that Montenegrins aren't related to the Serbs. Seen as a nationalist organization paired to the official Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts which it reckons pro-Serb, among other, the DANU makes some controversial statements expressing support of the World War II Montenegrin Nazi collaborators. At around the same time, he became the editor of Crnogorski knji≈æevni list (Montenegrin Literary Paper) also known as CKL that is published in Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian language, thus being the first ever newspaper published in Montenegrin. He is criticized for his frequent reversal of attitudes, from a \\"Greater Serb nationalist\\" to a Montenegrin independentist and Croatian sympathizer and even nationalist; his enemies mostly calling him an \\"Usta≈°a\\" because of his newfound Greater Croatian nationalist beliefs. His works also failed to achieve broader popularity due to frequent use of obscene and vulgar language. In 2001, his organization, the Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts, actively campaigned for the election of Milo ƒêukanoviƒá's \\"Coalition for an independent Montenegro\\". On October 24, 2006 Brkoviƒá and his driver and bodyguard Srƒëan Vojiƒçiƒá were attacked by three armed men. Vojiƒçiƒá was shot dead, while Brkoviƒá escaped with mild injuries. Speculation that the motive for the attack was his latest book, Ljubavnik Duklje (The Doclean Lover), in which he ridicules people from contemporary Montenegrin public life such as close friends of former Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá.

Life and career =Youth and initial success= Diether Krebs was born on 11 August 1947 in Essen, the son of a stationery shop owner. His godfather was Diether Posser, a lawyer, SPD politician and erstwhile Minister for Justice and Finance for North Rhine- Westphalia. Krebs gained his first experience in the theatre at school at the Humboldt Gymnasium in Essen. He took acting lessons at the renowned \\"Folkwangschule\\" school of performing arts in the Ruhrgebiet and took on his first role at the theatre in Oberhausen, followed by some small film roles. Of these, his most noteworthy appearance was in the film Zoff (1971) in which he played alongside well-known actors such as J√ºrgen Prochnow and Claus Theo G√§rtner. From 1973, Krebs became famous for his role as \\"Michael Graf\\" in the legendary comedy series Ein Herz und eine Seele, the German version of Till Death Us Do Part. Krebs played the same role as Tony Booth's Mike, the left- wing son-in-law of Alfred Tetzlaff (Alf Garnett), played by Heinz Schubert. In 1974, however, he left the series due to differences with the producers WDR. In the time that followed, Krebs made many television appearances, both in light entertainment and in more sophisticated series. In 1975, Peter Zadek chose him to play in Eiszeit with Heinz Bennent; in 1980 he played a main role in Die Judenbuche based on the story by Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff. =Detective thrillers= In 1978, Krebs turned to crime series: for eight years, from 1978 to 1986, he played \\"Dieter Herrle\\", the miserable chief detective in the series SOKO 5113. He made several guest appearances in the classic detective series Tatort, as well as in the famous Polizeiruf 110 and Der Alte. =Comedian and cabaret artist= Krebs achieved more success as a cabaret artist and comedian: in 1981, he made regular appearances on ' with Rudi Carrell, alongside Beatrice Richter and Klaus Havenstein. This poked fun at the main news programme, the Tagesschau, and caused a good deal of uproar. Krebs left his series, again because of disagreements with the producer (ARD). From 1985 to 1987 Krebs achieved cult status with his comedy series Sketchup in which he took on a wide range of different roles, accompanied at first by Beatrice Richter and then by Iris Berben. The series also became popular in other countries, such as Belgium. This series, followed by Knastmusik (1990) and Lauter nette Nachbarn (also 1990) built up Krebs's reputation as a comedian. =Actor, singer and presenter= In the years that followed, Diether Krebs acted in roles of varying quality. In 1986 he played the hairdresser \\"Hupsi\\" in Helmut Dietl's successful series Kir Royal ‚Äì Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters; in 1993 he took on a role in the catastrophe film M√∂bius by Matti Geschonneck. In 1991 he acted as a long-distance driver in the comedy Go Trabi Go by Peter Timm. That same year, he entered the German music charts: for a while he became famous as \\"Martin\\", a naive tree-hugger in a hand-knitted Fair Isle jumper with straggly hair and prominent teeth. He also played this character on stage. Krebs also worked as a television presenter, for example hosting the New Year Gala on MDR from 1996 and the Goldene Henne media award ceremony in 1999, also on MDR. =Hard times and a comeback= The last years of Diether Krebs's life were marked by his dwindling success and serious illness. In 1993, the RTL show R.O.S.T. - Die Diether Krebs-Show, which also starred Hugo Egon Balder, was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The Sat.1 comedy series Der Dicke und der Belgier with the Flemish comedian Carry Goossens was also cancelled in 1998 due to low viewing figures. Krebs was a strong smoker and by then he was suffering from lung cancer.http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/erinnerungen-an-diether-krebs-der- alleswoller-a-499064.html Nonetheless, at this time, he developed a new character which he played on stage: \\"Herr Krups\\", a funny sales rep with horn- rimmed glasses and wonky teeth. In 1998 he set off on a tour, starting in Berlin, with a routine including his own version of the Ruhrgebiet's ode to Currywurst. The text of this song which Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer made famous was written by Krebs. =His last role= In 1999, Diether Krebs played his last role in the Ruhrgebiet-based action comedy film Bang Boom Bang. Playing slimeball shipping agent Werner Kampmann he appeared alongside Ralf Richter and others in this film directed by . Some film critics acclaimed this as Krebs's best ever part.

Background  Tsutsumi was the son of Yasujir≈ç Tsutsumi, founder of the Seibu Railway company and a long-serving member, and eventually speaker, of Japan's House of Representatives. He was born in Tokyo in 1927. After receiving his degree in economics from the University of Tokyo in 1951, he re-enrolled as a literature student and worked as a secretary to his father. He joined the Seibu Department Stores in 1954. Following the death of his father in 1964, he led the spin-off of its logistics business to form the Saison Group, which eventually included the Seibu department stores, Seiyu supermarkets, Wave (a music shop), Parco (shopping complex), and the Muji and Loft variety store chains. He resigned as head of Saison in 1991 following the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, but continued as head of the Saison Cultural Foundation, which he founded in 1987. Just before the death of his father Tasujiro, his brother Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was nominated as his heir, potentially due to Seiji's brief involvement with the Japanese Communist Party after the World War Two.

Life  Siemowit was the second son of Trojden I of Masovia and his wife Maria, daughter of Yuri I of Galicia. In 1341, following the death of their father and brother, Siemowit and his younger brother Casimir inherited the Duchy of Czersk. In 1345 following the death of their uncle Siemowit II of Rawa, they also inherited the Duchy of Rawa. In 1349 the two brothers shared their possessions. Siemowit gave the small region of Warsaw to his brother Casimir, retaining the regions of Czersk, Liw and Rawa. Early in his reign, Siemowit tried to establish good neighborly relations with his powerful neighbors: the Teutonic Order, Poland and Bohemia. Some historians believe that Siemowit rendered a tribute of vassalage to Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1346. Other historians say this happened in 1351, in order to inherit from Boleslaw III of P≈Çock who was a vassal of Bohemia. But on September 18, 1351, Siemowit and Casimir recognised the Polish King Casimir III the Great as suzerain, canceling the allegiance of Masovia and Bohemia. In exchange, they got Gostynin (Siemowit) and Sochaczew (Casimir), former possessions of Boleslaw III. Casimir also gave the Duchy of P≈Çock to the brothers. When his brother Casimir died unexpectedly in 1355, Casimir III the Great left the Duchy of Warsaw to Siemowit. In exchange, he promised never to ally with enemies of Poland and the Duchy of P≈Çock would return to Poland, unless Casimir III died without an heir. In addition, Casimir III offered Siemowit a small territory of Lesser Poland bounded by the river Pilica and Radomka. From that time, relations between Siemowit and Casimir III the Great become increasingly narrow. In 1363, Siemowit was invited to Krakow for the marriage of Elizabeth of Pomerania, granddaughter of the king of Poland, with the Emperor Charles IV. In September 1364 he participated in a conference in Krakow, which offered five crowned kings, dukes and princes extravagant festivities and tournaments. In 1369 Margaret, the daughter of Siemowit, wife of Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania, adopted an illegitimate son of Casimir III the Great. At that time, Casimir IV of S≈Çupsk was one of the contenders to succeed Casimir III the Great, who left only daughters. When Casimir III the Great died in 1370, under agreements concluded with one of his lifetime friends Siemowit III, he freed Siemowit from Polish suzerainty and gave P≈Çock, Wizna, Wyszogr√≥d and Zakroczym back to Mazovia. Having a reunified Masovia, it regained its independence, there Siemowit III promulgates a customary law in 1377. He reformed the administration, justice and the monetary system. In 1373/1374 he gave the regions of Warsaw and Rawa to his sons, Siemowit IV of Masovia and Janusz I of Warsaw.  Marriages and Issue  In 1335, Siemowit married Euphemia, daughter of Nicholas II of Opava. They had the following children:POLAND, Medieval Lands #Euphemia (-21 June 1418/9 December 1424), married W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk. #Anna (before 1345-after 16 Mar 1403), nun at Ratibor. #Janusz I of Warsaw (-8 Dec 1429), succeeded in 1374 as Janusz I, Prince of Ciechan√≥w and Warsaw . #Margaret (before 1358-14 May 1388/4 April 1396), married firstly to Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania and secondly to Henry VII of Brzeg. #Siemowit IV of Masovia (b. ca. 1353/1356Kazimierz Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w mazowieckich.

Siemowit remarried, after Euphemia's death to Anna, daughter of Nicolas of Ziƒôbice. From this marriage he had three children: #unnamed son (1361/1364 - died young before 14 Mar 1378). #unnamed son (1362/1365 - died young before 14 Mar 1378). #Henry of Masovia (1368/1370‚Äì1392/1393), became Bishop of P≈Çock. Siemowit accused Anna of adultery when she became pregnant with Henry. After his birth Siemowit had Anna strangled and Henry cast away. However, it turned out Henry was the son of Siemowit so he was made a bishop. After working his whole life on reuniting Masovia and making it an independent state, Siemowit III died on June 16, 1381 and was buried at Plock Cathedral.

Leslie Hotson (16 August 1897 ‚Äì 16 November 1992) was a scholar of Elizabethan literary puzzles. Biography He was born at Delhi, Ontario, on 16 August 1897.Social Security Death Index He studied at Harvard University, where he obtained a B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. He went on to hold a number of academic posts. Hotson was known for his tenacious archival research and his interest in coded information. He had a number of notable successes, but not all of his \\"decodings\\" have been accepted by other scholars. He discovered the identity of Ingram Frizer, the killer of Christopher Marlowe, and reconstructed the shape of the original Shakespearean theater. He also unearthed the letters that Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote to his divorced wife Harriet; produced evidence of Shakespeare's father as a wool dealer; illuminated Shakespeare's early years in Stratford-upon- Avon; and identified John Day as the killer of Henry Porter, a minor Elizabethan dramatist. Some of his solutions to literary puzzles are still in dispute. He claimed to have identified one Nicholas Colfox as the murderer of Thomas of Woodstock by \\"decoding\\" Chaucer's The Nun's Priest's Tale. He also claimed to have identified Mr W H, the person to whom Shakespeare's sonnets were dedicated, as a William Hatcliffe of Lincolnshire. He later argued that a miniature colour portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicted Shakespeare as a young man. As the New York Times stated in his obituary: \\"it was chiefly as a Shakespearian detective that Dr Hotson remained in the public eye, sometimes to the annoyance of rival scholars who discounted his theories.\\" His first major work, The Death of Christopher Marlowe ‚Äî which made his name ‚Äî is still in print. He stumbled across the evidence while decoding Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale in the archives of the English Public Records Office in 1923‚Äì24.Several different names had been mentioned in connection with Marlowe's death, two of which were \\"one Ingram\\" and \\"ffrancis ffrezer\\".

Named after a local commandry of the Teutonic Order (Deutscher Orden), it became known for a monumental equestrian statue of William I, first German Emperor, erected in 1897 in appreciation for his role in the unification of Germany. One of many Emperor William monuments raised in the Prussian Rhine Province, it was destroyed in World War II and only the plinth was preserved as a memorial. Following German reunification, a replica of the statue was erected on the pedestal after controversial discussions in 1993. It is today a Koblenz landmark and a popular tourist destination. History Deutsches Eck with St. Castor's Basilica and Teutonic Commandry, about 1875 The Teutonic Knights were called to Koblenz by the Trier archbishop Theoderich von Wied in 1216 and vested with the estates around the Basilica of St. Castor located directly at the confluence of Mosel and Rhine. Serving mainly in nursing care, the knights soon after established a commandry (Deutschordenskommende) here, which became the administrative seat of the Koblenz bailiwick directly subordinate to the Grand Master. The premises centred around the Deutschherrenhaus building were erected from 1279 onwards and became known as Deutsches Eck. About 1600, the Koblenz commander relocated his seat down the Rhine to Cologne. In 1794 the Left Bank of the Rhine was conquered by French revolutionary troops and the ecclesiastical estates secularised from 1802 onwards. The Order's premises were refurbished as part of the Prussian Koblenz Fortress. Later in the 19th century, the area was linked by a pier with a downstream sandbank creating the present-day headland. =Imperial iconography= After the death of Emperor William I in 1888, his grandson William II wished to spark a nationalist cult around the \\"founder of the German Reich\\". In the following years the privately funded Kyffh√§user Monument was erected and an Emperor William Monument was inaugurated in Porta Westfalica, both designed by the Leipzig architect Bruno Schmitz. Several other cities had also applied as installation sites and in 1891 William II decided upon the confluence of the Rhine and Mosel rivers at Koblenz. Inauguration ceremony, 31 August 1897 After further landfills at the site and a large-scale collection campaign, the official \\"Emperor William Monument of the Rhine Province\\" was erected and solemnly inaugurated in the presence of the emperor on 31 August 1897. Bruno Schmitz again had drawn up the plans for a giant, over high monument installed at the tip of the Deutsches Eck, bearing an inscription quoting a verse by the Koblenz poet Max von Schenkendorf: Nimmer wird das Reich zerst√∂ret, wenn ihr einig seid und treu (\\"Never will the Empire be destroyed, so long as you are united and loyal\\"). Another inscription could be found at the statue dedicating it to Wilhelm der Gro√üe (\\"William the Great\\"). The equestrian statue itself, in height, presented William I in a general's uniform, reminiscent of the Prussian victories in the \\"German Wars of Unification\\". His horse is roped by a winged female genius bearing a laurel wreath and the Imperial Crown. After World War I under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Rhine Province was occupied by Allied forces. When in November 1929 the area was finally cleared according to the Young Plan, tens of thousands gathered at the Deutsches Eck to celebrate the \\"liberation of the Rhineland\\". On 22 July 1930 Reich President Paul von Hindenburg celebrated the completion of his triumphal journey through the Rhenish lands here with a festive banquet and a firework display. Later in the same evening, 38 people were killed when a pontoon bridge across the Mosel collapsed under the weight of the crowds. =Demolition= Destroyed statue in 1945 While the inner city of Koblenz was hit hard by Allied strategic bombing during World War II, the Deutsches Eck remained largely unscathed. On 16 March 1945, however, the statue was badly damaged by an American artillery shell. The Third US Army 87th Artillery unit led by Sergeant Loyd Watson fired upon it after the forward observer saw a German soldier depart from it. They assumed it was a base of operations and it was hit after three attempts. Soon afterwards it was completely taken down. The French military government planned to replace the old memorial with a monument for peace and understanding among nations, but that concept was never realized. After the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic in 1949, the country was divided into a capitalist west and a communist east. In order to express the deep wish for a united Germany, President Theodor Heuss turned the German Corner into a monument to German unity. As a result, the coats of arms of all German L√§nder (states), including those of former German territories such as Silesia, East Prussia and Pomerania, were installed. Replacing the destroyed equestrian statue, a German flag flew over the plaza. After the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, three concrete parts of the actual wall were installed next to the monument. On 3 October 1990, the emblems of the new federal states were added. =Reinstallation= The replacement statue being hoisted onto the base A passenger ship deftly steers round the Deutsches Eck With German Reunification in 1990, the German Corner no longer served as a symbol of the aspiration for a united Germany. Thus, a discussion arose regarding a remodelling of the plaza. Critics considered the reinstallation of the equestrian statue of Wilhelm I as anachronistic and improper, whereas promoters saw the opportunity for tourist benefits. As the owner of the site, any decision to reinstall a statue of Wilhelm I rested with the government of the Rhineland-Palatinate. However, the state government transferred its rights to the city of Koblenz. When Werner Theisen, a former newspaper publisher from Koblenz, and his wife Anneliese, announced that they would bear all costs for a reconstruction of the statue, the decision was made to proceed. The D√ºsseldorf sculptor, Raymond Kittl, was commissioned to produce a replica of the original sculpture and the remodelled statue was created from durable bronze cast unlike the original which had been made from copper plates. In May 1992, the parts of the statue were brought to Koblenz on board the MS Futura. The assembly work was completed at the port and on 2 September 1993 a mobile lattice boom crane lifted the statue onto the base. The installation took place on Sedan Day, which although no longer officially recognized, was the day on which the German victory in the Battle of Sedan was commemorated. On 25 September 1993, the new statue was inaugurated. Today, a big national flag and the flags of the 16 L√§nder are flying at the German Corner as a reminder of German unity. In addition the flag of the United States of America is displayed as a sign of support for the victims of the September 11 attacks. The three parts of the Berlin Wall are now dedicated to the \\"victims of the division\\".

Career Sh≈´wa's most significant games were probably the three challenge games of 1840 and 1842 against Inoue Gennan Inseki. After Jowa's resignation of the post of Meijin godokoro in 1839, Gennan was making yet another run for the post of Meijin godokoro when the Honinbo house lodged a complaint with the government, leading to the first game between Sh≈´wa and Gennan in 1840. Shuwa won this game by 4 points (on black), leaving Gennan so dismayed by his strength that he discontinued the series and withdrew his application.Power, John. Invincible; The Games of Shusaku, p.12. Tokyo, Japan: Kiseido Publishing Company, 1982. The subsequent games in 1842 were attempts by Gennan to show he could beat Sh≈´wa taking white (even though he could take black every 3rd game, as befitted a difference of 1 dan rank), but he was beaten twice more, the second time by 6 points and the third time by 4 points.Ohira, Shuzo. Appreciating Famous Games, p.86. Tokyo, Japan: The Ishi Press, 1982. After these 3 losses Gennan resigned himself to retiring as an 8-dan, despite the fact that he was recognized by many (including his great rival J≈çwa) as being equivalent to Meijin in strength. Sh≈´wa's comprehensive victories over Gennan established himself as the pre-eminent player of the day. He reached 8-dan soon after his triumph, and his only serious rivals in the prime of his career were the group known as the Tempo Top Four ‚Äì Yasui Sanchi, It≈ç Sh≈çwa, ≈åta Y≈´z≈ç, and Sakaguchi Sentoku. Although he played some games with the members of this group on even terms, he generally gave them a handicap. He found Sanchi to be his most difficult opponent, and Y≈´z≈ç to be his easiest.Ohira, Shuzo. Appreciating Famous Games, p.107. Tokyo, Japan: The Ishi Press, 1982. Unfortunately, Sh≈´wa's aspirations to be Meijin were undone by a variety of factors. The primary problem was the instability of the Tokugawa regime in its final decade, which gave very little thought to matters of Go in its final years. Sh≈´wa also suffered a critical defeat at the hands of the 13th Inoue, Matsumoto Inseki. Matsumoto was certainly not in Sh≈´wa's class as a Go player, but Sh≈´wa perhaps made too leisurely a start in his game, allowing Matsumoto two shimaris in the fuseki. When Sh≈´wa realized he was not catching up as easily as normal he exerted himself fully, but Matsumoto was just able to hold him off and score an improbable 1-point victory (taking black). It was said at the time that Matsumoto was possessed by the spirit of Gennan Inseki, and Sh≈´wa was forced to abandon his ambitions of becoming Meijin. Nonetheless, he remained at the pinnacle of the Go world until his death in 1873. The end of his life was at the worst point of go's fortunes after the Meiji Restoration. He lived to see the Hon'inb≈ç residence in Edo (Tokyo) taken back by the state in 1869Go Monthly Review 1964/1 p.77 The family members for a while resumed the family name Tsuchiya. While his reputation is somewhat overshadowed by that of his brilliant, pious and short-lived pupil Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´saku, it is undecided and to an extent imponderable who was the stronger, the typical playing conditions of the time meaning that they did not test this in matches played purely as competition. Sh≈´saku's games having been published soon after his death, they became a training manual, adding to the impression of the pupil's level. Sh≈´saku possessed an unusual modesty, and would always take black against out of respect for his teacher, even upon reaching 7-dan. Sh≈´wa played a famous 17 game series with Sh≈´saku between 1846 and 1847, which contained some of the best Go of the classical era. Taking white in all games, Sh≈´wa lost the series 4-13, and his overall results against Shusaku were 6-17-1,Power, John. Invincible; The Games of Shusaku, p.36. Tokyo, Japan: Kiseido Publishing Company, 1982. but in light of the handicaps and Sh≈´saku's natural brilliance at the Go board, it is virtually impossible to compare the two players. Sh≈´wa's style was unspectacular but thoroughly professional. His style with Black epitomized the values of classical Go ‚Äì making one's groups safe and strong early on. He is greatly admired by modern professionals for his light, flexible play, as well as his refinement and mastery of \\"amashi\\" when playing with white. Although he did not officially reach the rank of 9-dan (Meijin), he is honored as one of the Four Sages (players who were said to be of Meijin strength but only reached 8-dan) alongside Hon'inb≈ç Genjo, Yasui Chitoku Senchi, and Gennan Inseki. Apart from his genius on the Go board, Sh≈´wa is also famous for his brilliant pupils and sons. Three of his natural sons became head of house after him: Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´etsu, Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´ei and Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´gen were respectively his eldest, second and third sons. In addition, he gave generous amounts of his time to his brilliant pupils Hon'inb≈ç Sh≈´saku and Murase Sh≈´ho, who went on to become 18th Hon'inb≈ç. One of the factors in the eventual revival of organised go was a study group called \\"Third Day Meeting\\" that Sh≈´wa himself had set up, when the oshirogo ceased in the early 1860s. This grouping survived and contributed to the later Hoensha.Go Monthly Review 1964/1, p.78 Awards *He was inducted into the Nihon Ki-in Hall of Fame in 2006.

A series of mysterious deaths occur and circumstantial evidence implicates Miles. His mother, of course, does not want to believe her beloved son is a heartless killer. It is only when Father Penny (played by Paul Sorvino) arrives at the hospital in critical condition that she is convinced her son is evil. Penny tells her that Miles was responsible, and she rushes home to save her step daughter and have Miles arrested. The events that follow pit Miles against his mother, and she ends up locking him in a walk-in freezer. The police arrive and discover that Miles, though apparently frozen, is still alive. His mother comes to the rescue by shooting her son in the chest with a policeman's revolver. At the hospital later, it is implied Miles survived but it's unclear if he will survive the surgery as the techniques to save his life 'aren't quite there yet'. The final scene is set at the cryogenics facility, where another alarm goes off as another storage tank malfunctions and begins to thaw. This is followed, by several more storage tanks malfunctioning.

The game is set in Europe during the 1890s, and follows a young female opera singer turned vampire as she attempts to make the journey back home to Paris in search of fame and normality. The title's distinctive spelling of vampire with a y was derived from the seminal western vampire tale The Vampyre by John Polidori.  Gameplay  A Vampyre Story was created by a number of former LucasArts adventure game developers, and is similar to some of their previous games (such as The Curse of Monkey Island or The Dig) in presentation and style. As such, the game uses a point-and-click interface with a context-sensitive radial cursor, much the same as Monkey Island: upon clicking an interactive item, a graphic menu will appear around the object, displaying the available actions and abilities. As the game progresses, Mona will gradually learn how to use her new supernatural abilities. Consequently, her newfound powers and weaknesses will play a large role in the game's puzzles, requiring Mona to use her abilities to overcome certain challenges and progress through the game.  Plot  Mona De Lafitte, the game's protagonist, is a young and talented Parisian opera student who becomes the object of obsession for a rather pathetic vampire. As a result, Mona is swiftly kidnapped and taken to his castle in Draxsylvania, where she is turned into an undead vampire. Mona must find a way to return home and fulfill her dream of becoming a famous opera singer, while also dealing with the unfamiliar problems inherent in her new condition. Mona is not alone throughout the adventure however, but is followed by her newly acquired and sarcastic sidekick, Froderick the bat. The game is divided into two main areas: Castle Warg ‚Äî the home of her kidnapper, Shrowdy von Kieffer, and his mother, the Baroness Vasilia von Kieffer ‚Äî and the town of Vlad's Landing. The cliffhanger ending suggests an upcoming sequel, which has since been announced: A Vampyre Story 2: A Bat's Tale.  Development  A Vampyre Story was first announced in the June 2004 issue of The Inventory, an online adventure gaming magazine, as the winner of their \\"Most-Awaited Adventure Game\\" award. The game was originally given a tentative release date of Halloween 2006, but the loss of publisher backing in April 2005 left the game in unpaid preproduction for the following year. During this time Bill Tiller, Autumn Moon's founder and creative director, generally worked with no more than one or two other people on staff at any one time. This helped to reduce the cost of production while the project was still unfunded. In early July 2006 however, Autumn Moon announced that they had finally acquired a new publisher for A Vampyre Story, the Hamburg-based Crimson Cow, and that full production on the game would begin shortly thereafter, stating an expected 2007 release. In September 2007 however, the first trailer for A Vampyre Story was released, specifying a new date of early 2008. While Autumn Moon has mentioned their interest in the Nintendo DS and Wii as potential release platforms, no official announcements have yet been made.  Audio  The A Vampyre Story Original Soundtrack was composed and produced by Pedro Macedo Camacho, featuring soprano vocals by Carla Isabel Moniz and violin solos by Carlos Freitas. The soundtrack was released as an extra to the collector's edition of the game. According to an article in Develop Magazine, and an interview in The Pumpkin Post, John Williams‚Äô work on the Harry Potter film series and Michael Land's work on the Monkey Island (series) were Camacho's main influences. Several websites mentioned the soundtrack as one of the game's best features and described it as 'absolutely fantastic', 'memorable and melancholy', 'great', and 'ingenious'. Reception A Vampyre Story was commercially unsuccessful. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2013 that it \\"sold between 30,000 and 35,000 copies, well short of the expectations to move 80,000 units.\\"  Sequel and prequel  A Vampyre Story was intended as the opening chapter of a larger saga, and Autumn Moon Entertainment commenced production on the sequel prior to the game's release. A Vampyre Story 2: A Bat's Tale was described as picking up directly after the events of A Vampyre Story, which ended with a cliffhanger. Originally slated for a release in 2009 or 2010 - a much quicker turnaround than the first installment - the sequel's development has been indefinitely stalled due to budgetary contentions between Autumn Moon and the game's publisher, Crimson Cow Games. With the publishing rights to the sequel owned by Crimson Cow, Autumn Moon decided to work independently on an episodic prequel called A Vampyre Story: Year One. The series will depict Mona's first year of captivity in Castle Warg, including her introduction to Froderick the bat. Bill Tiller initially announced the project in 2010, stating that he was working on the game in his free time. He later considered collaborating with MunkyFun, where he was at the time working as the studio's art director and which had previously been commissioned to assist in the building of Autumn Moon's graphic adventure engine. Ultimately, Tiller announced that he would attempt to get the game funded via Kickstarter, and launched the project on June 1, 2013. Though the campaign proved unsuccessful, Tiller and a skeleton crew from the previous Autumn Moon games decided to keep the project going. The effort to convert the Autumn Moon engine to Unity led to Duke Grabowski: Mighty Swashbuckler!

Its main role was as a prime mover for medium towed guns ranging from the 3.7 cm FlaK 43 anti- aircraft gun up to the 10.5 cm leFH 18 field howitzer. It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer. The basic engineering for all the German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms with the understanding that production would be shared with multiple companies. BorgwardThe actual development was done by Hansa-Lloyd, a subsidiary of the Borgward Group was chosen to develop the second smallest of the German half-tracks and built a series of prototypes between 1934 and 1937. However development was taken over in 1938 by Hanomag who designed the main production version, H kl 6. The chassis formed the basis for the Sd.Kfz. 251 medium armored personnel carrier. Approximately 9,000 were produced between 1938 and 1945, making it one of the more numerous German tactical vehicles of the war. It participated in the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France, the Balkans Campaign and fought on both the Western Front and the Eastern Front, in North Africa and in Italy. Description Sd.Kfz. 11 chassis shown at the factory. From left, the muffler, fuel tank and transmission are visible The Sd.Kfz. 11 used a conventional ladder frame. Power was provided by a front- mounted Maybach six-cylinder, water-cooled, HL 42 TRKM gasoline engine of . It had a Hanomag U 50 transmission with four forward and one reverse gears. Maximum speed was and it could ford water deep.Spielberger, p. 158 Both tracks and wheels were powered as well as used for steering. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would be applied to the tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprockets had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk system, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted at the rear of the vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels, carried on the rigid front axle, had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers, the only ones on the vehicle, to dampen impacts.Spielberger, p. 158 Two different upper bodies were built over the production run of the Sd.Kfz. 11. The \\"artillery\\" body had an ammunition compartment separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. The ammunition compartment had doors that opened on each side of the vehicle and could be configured for different sizes of ammunition. Bench seats on the sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The crew entered from the rear of the vehicle. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the ammunition compartment. It fastened to the windshield and to the rear of the crew compartment when erected. Side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.Spielberger, pp. 36-38 The \\"engineer\\" body had three bench seats for the crew and a convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather. There was a storage compartment at the rear of the vehicle, underneath the crew seats. Photographic evidence shows both \\"artillery\\" and \\"engineer\\" versions were used by artillery units.Spielberger, pp. 36-38 Design and development Preliminary design of all the German half-tracks of the early part of the war was done by Dipl.Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp of the Military Automotive Department (Wa Pr√ºf 6) before the Nazis took power in 1933. His designs were then turned over to commercial firms for development and testing.Spielberger, p. 24 Borgward was assigned to develop the towing vehicle with the first HL. kl. 2 prototype produced in 1933. It had a six-cylinder, , Hansa-Lloyd Type 3500 L engine mounted in the front, a four-speed Hansa-Lloyd-Goliath transmission, had only four roadwheels per side and weighed . The improved HL. kl. 3 prototype followed in 1936, but differed only in details from the earlier prototype.Spielberger, pp. 33-35 The first production model was the HL.kl.5 which still used the Type 3500 L engine and the Hansa-Lloyd-Goliath transmission, but was lengthened by two roadwheels per side. It weighed and could carry a payload of while towing a load. 505 were made by Borgward between 1936‚Äî38 at the price of 20,000 Reichsmarks each.Spielberger, p. 34 Hanomag took over development of the vehicle in 1938 and designed the H kl 6 which initially used a Maybach HL 38 TUKR engine that was superseded early in the production run by a HL 42 TUKRM. Hanomag replaced the Hansa-Lloyd-Goliath transmission with their own four-speed U 50 transmission and enlarged the fuel tank to . The vehicle weight climbed to , but the payload also increased to .Spielberger, p. 37 Production Borgward and Hanomag initially built the Sd.Kfz. 11 chassis, but later Adlerwerke of Frankfurt-am-Main, Horch of Zwickau and ≈†koda of Mlad√° Boleslav were added to the production plan. On 20 December 1942 some 4209 were in service. 2133 were built in 1943 and 1308 in 1944. All told, over 9000 were built by 1945.Spielberger, p. 37, 39 Variants =Sd.Kfz. 11/1= There were two vehicles created during the war and given this designation. The earlier vehicle was a version of the Sd.Kfz. 11, an ammunition carrier for the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35 or 40 mortar. The ammunition compartment had racks to hold the shells and their propellant with side-opening doors.Spielberger, p. 39 The later version created in 1944, the Sd.Kfz. 11/1, was an anti aircraft vehicle using the armoured front superstructure of the Sd.Kfz. 251 and mounting a 2 cm Flak 38 gun. =Sd.Kfz. 11/2= A Sd.Kfz. 11/2 painted with the insignia of the Werfer-Lehr Regiment The Sd.Kfz. 11/2 was a chemical decontamination vehicle fitted with a capacity spreader and space for eight barrels of decontamination chemicals. This left room for only three crewmen. The barrels were stowed on platforms over the tracks with foldable outer rails.Spielberger, p. 39 > According to a reliable report the medium vehicle carries of bleach; a strip > wide and 1.4 kilometers (just over a mile) long can be decontaminated by > using a density of of bleach per square meter.

The spray nozzle swung back and forth to cover a width of . 125 were built in 1937.Spielberger, p. 39 =Sd.Kfz. 11/4= The Sd.Kfz. 11/4 was an ammunition vehicle for units using the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 multiple rocket launcher. Its ammunition racks could carry mortar shells, or rockets. It could carry thirty-six 15 cm or ten 21 cm rockets as well as the six man crew of the launcher.Spielberger, p. 39 A Sd.Kfz. 11/5 in Russia towing a 21 cm Nebelwerfer 42 =Sd.Kfz. 11/5= The Sd.Kfz. 11/5 was an ammunition vehicle for units using the Nebelwerfer multiple rocket launcher. Unlike earlier Nebelwerfer ammunition vehicles it was given a wooden upper body with two compartments. The forward cargo compartment was open-topped and lacked the racks of earlier models. The rear crew compartment had a bench seat facing the rear of the vehicle with rifle racks on each side of the seat. Notes Footnotes References * Chamberlain, Peter, and Hilary L. Doyle. Thomas L.

She is known not only for her writing but also for her significant role in the London art world. Life Elizabeth Eastlake was born in Norwich into the large family of Edward and Anne Rigby. Her father, a physician and classical scholar, and her mother included her in their social life and conversation with prominent citizens and intellectuals. Elizabeth was fond of drawing from a young age and continued studying art into her twenties, when she was taught to draw and etch by the artist Edward Daniell. She was privately educated and learnt French and Italian, but after an illness in 1827, she was sent to convalesce in Germany and Switzerland. She stayed two years and started a lifetime of publication with a translation of Johann David Passavant's essay on English art; a second trip to Germany in 1835 led to an article on Goethe. After travelling to Russia and Estonia to visit a married sister, her published letters and her travel book A Residence on the Shores of the Baltic (1841) led to an invitation to write for the Quarterly Review by the editor, John Gibson Lockhart.

Sometimes, she collaborated with her husband, and she wrote a memoir of him after his death in 1865. Italian art also absorbed her attention; Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, Raphael and D√ºrer were the subjects of her Five Great Painters (1883), published ten years before she died. In 1895 her nephew Charles Eastlake Smith edited her Letters and Correspondence, the first volume of which at least was read by the late 19th century English novelist George Gissing in July of the following year.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.416. Reputation In the 20th century, aside from her Photography, she was remembered mostly for her scathing review of Jane Eyre, of which she strongly disapproved. She disputed the morality of the novel, writing that ‚Äòthe popularity of Jane Eyre is a proof how deeply the love for illegitimate romance is implanted in our nature‚Äô and summarising with ‚ÄòIt is a very remarkable book: we have no remembrance of another combining such genuine power with such horrid taste‚Äô. She is also known for her attacks on John Ruskin, assumed to be linked to her role as confidante to his estranged wife, Effie Gray. According to historian Rosemary Mitchell, however, her work as art historian and writer was significant and original. Mitchell considers Eastlake to have been a scholarly and perceptive critic, and Marion Lochhead regards Eastlake as a 'pioneer of feminine journalism',Marian Lochhead, Elizabeth Rigby: Lady Eastlake.

He was a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, ran a printing company, attempted to be elected as an MP in England, ran a marble quarrying company, and finally bred deer in south-west France. Biography Bourke was born in Gosforth, Northumbria. His father was the Honorable Bryan Longley Bourke, the 3rd son of Walter Longley Bourke, 8th Earl of Mayo. Bourke was educated at St. Aubyns Preparatory School in Rottingdean before attending the Dartmouth Royal Naval College as a cadet. He joined the Fleet Air Arm, and flew Sea Hawks in the Suez Crisis in 1956. He then flew aerobatics with No. 703 Naval Air Squadron. He left the Royal Navy on medical grounds in 1959. He set up a printing company in Gosport in Hampshire, and became active in local politics, serving as a Conservative councillor from 1961 to 1964. He inherited his titles from his uncle Ulick Henry Bourke, 9th Earl of Mayo, in 1962. However, his Irish peerages (Earl of Mayo, Viscount Mayo of Monycrower and Lord Naas) only entitled him to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was abolished under the Acts of Union 1800. He stood for Parliament as a Liberal candidate in South Dorset in the 1964 general election, but lost heavily to the Conservative candidate. In 1965, he moved to County Galway in the Republic of Ireland, where he became managing director of the Irish Marble Company, which quarries Connemara marble. He also founded the Galway flying club (leading to the creation of Galway airport). He married twice. He was first married to Margaret Jane Robinson Harrison in 1952. They had three sons, but were divorced in 1987. He was remarried to Sally Anne Matthews, in 1987. With his second wife and their son, he moved to a chateau in the south-west of France, where he bred deer. Lord Mayo was buried at Mondebat in the French d√©partement of Gers. He was succeeded to his titles by his eldest son, Charles Bourke, 11th Earl of Mayo.

Some species have greatly reduced wings. Fewer than 100 species are known, mostly from Europe. Although they occur in all major regions, they seem to be most varied in the Holarctic region. Around 20 diverse genera have been placed in the family. Two, Teratomyza and Teratoptera, are now in the Teratomyzidae, and Cyamops and Stenomicra are in the Stenomicridae. Melanthomyza Malloch from Chile should probably not be retained in the family. The remaining genera are very similar to one another. Anthomyzidae wing veins Description For terms see Morphology of Diptera These are minute to small (1.3-4.5 mm), slender flies. They are yellow (sometimes with dark spots or stripes) to black in colour. The postverticals on the head are small, convergent or parallel, and rarely absent. Two or three pairs of frontal bristles, which curve backward, are present and usually preceded by one or more weaker bristles. Interfrontal bristles are absent or present. Peristomal bristles (\\"false vibrissae\\") are present. In the more common Anthomyza and Paranthomyza, the lower side of femur 1 has a well-developed spine in apical third. Wings are usually long and narrow and immaculate (sometimes marked). Some species are brachypterous. The costa has a subcostal break and the subcosta is incomplete. Biology Anthomyza sp. ovipositing on an old (empty) head of grass Larvae have been reported from decaying dicotyledonous plants, from fungi, and in Europe from leaf sheaths of various grasses and of Typha, Scirpus, and Juncus, from Lipara galls on Phragmites. They may be either phytophagous or saprophagous, but damage to cereals or other plants has not been reported. Adults are usually found in moist habitats such as damp meadows, marshes, bogs, and damp deciduous or mixed forests with rich undergrowth. Some species inhabit dry grasslands (some species of Anthomyza and the brachypterous Stiphrosoma sabulosum).

Baseball NT was formed in 1968 under its original name, the Northern Territory Baseball League. Baseball NT is governed nationally by the Australian Baseball Federation. Historically, baseball in Australia and the Northern Territory has been an amateur sport.  Overview  Organised baseball is played in Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine. Darwin has four clubs; Nightcliff Tigers, Palmerston Reds, Pints and Tracy Village Rebels. The East Darwin Beasts disbanded in 1987 and the South Darwin Rabbitohs disbanded in 2004. In Darwin, baseball is a dry-season sport, played between April and September each year. Baseball in Darwin is controlled by the Darwin Baseball Association. The Katherine Baseball Association has four teams; Dodgers, Cubs, Angels and Braves. The sport is usually played between the months of February through to September, during the dry season. Predominantly, only under seventeen competitions are played due to a lack of interested players. Although a high percentage of participating players are successful in making local squads and Territory/ state teams. Alice Springs has six teams; Bulls, Cubs, Demons, Panthers, Redbacks and Venom. In Alice Springs, baseball is a summer sport, usually played between October and March. Baseball in Alice Springs is controlled by the Alice Springs Baseball Association.

In 1999, the Northern Territory won the Cup for the first time under the leadership of player/coach, Andrew Kendray.The Official Handbook of the Darwin Baseball League Inc: 1999 Edition. Success for the Northern Territory is difficult as promising juniors are attracted away from the Territory to pursue careers in the southern leagues where their development and opportunities are greater.

Rarely do these players return to the Northern Territory. This has created a catch 22 situation for Baseball NT whereby it understands that by developing home-grown talent, there is a good possibility these players will be lost to southern leagues, unlikely to return to the Northern Territory. In November 1983 however, Territory players were selected to play for Australia against the touring Japanese Industrial League champions, Toshiba, and included, Bill Fryar, Dwayne McInnes and Laurie Moore from Darwin; John Baldock from Tennant Creek and Darren Welch from Alice Springs. Since the late 1990s, the popularity and standard of baseball in the Northern Territory has steadily declined as it struggles to compete against Australian icon sports such as cricket, as well as attract juniors away from the information technology revolution such as computer games and the \\"hip-hop\\" culture.

Controversy In November 2008, the Pine Rivers Rapids club announced their interest in a breakaway league from the Greater Brisbane League that Baseball Queensland runs. The controversy arose before the start of the 2008-2009 season when Pine Rivers amongst other high profile clubs, were warned that they are in danger of not meeting GBL Major League criteria which enables them to have a team in the top three divisions of Queensland baseball.

After a number of years without an organised baseball body in the state, a league was re-formed in 2007 with the hopes of re-igniting baseball in the state.  History  Baseball reached its peak in Tasmania during the 1970s and 1980s, with a league in both Hobart and Launceston. However, by the late 1980s, the Launceston league was forced to disband as league started to lack players to fill the teams. The Hobart league lasted until the early 1990s before it folded due to financial troubles. There was no organised baseball in Tasmania after the collapse of the Hobart league, until 2007, a group of Masters players got together with the goal of re-instating a league in the state's capital of Hobart. This was primarily driven by a group of Masters players who had been involved in the previous incarnation of Baseball Tasmania many years ago and wished to restart a baseball league in Tasmania. After some initial open days, the new league was launched in October 2007 with 4 teams: Red Sox, Whitesox, Blue Jays and Green Bays. The Blue Jays won the first ever game of new league. Two seasons were run in the original summer, with a season being run until the Christmas break in December and then a new season running from January until March. Games were played at Prince of Wales Bay Recreation Ground in Goodwood (in the city of Glenorchy, north of Hobart) till the 2012-13 season when the ground underwent a major overhaul to install new storm water pipes. The 2012-13 season was played at Goodwood Primary School and with ongoing problems at Prince of Wales Bay, the 2013-14 season was initially played there also until half way through the season when circumstances warranted a move to Shoobridge Park in Claremont. Changes began occurring in the 2013-14 season with the introduction of the Dragons Softball team (the last remaining men's softball team in southern Tasmania), the allocation of recruiting zones to each of the teams and the renaming of the league to the Hobart Summer Baseball League (HSBL), with Baseball Tasmania the governing body. The Athletics became the Eastern Athletics, the Red Sox became the Southern Red Sox, the White Sox became the Northern White Sox and the Blue Jays retained their name but had a recruiting area of central Hobart. Once again the league tried a five team competition but by the last month of the season, numbers for the White Sox and the Red Sox had dropped off so dramatically that the remaining players had to amalgamate to form a viable team. The 2014-15 season heralded the return of the league to Prince of Wales Bay Recreation Ground and with it, a new found enthusiasm. Full-time scorers were introduced for the first time and by mid season, all teams had secured proper uniforms to look the part for playing baseball. The competition, back to a four team format with the Dragons, Eastern Athletics, Hobart Blue Jays, and the Northern White Sox, was highly competitive and for the first time, a sponsor was involved in the league with Hotel Soho agreeing to sponsor the Hobart Blue Jays. For a number of years, an over 45 team, representing the Baseball Tasmania league under the name of the Tassie Tigers, had traveled to Ballarat (or Geelong) in Victoria to compete in the Victorian Masters Baseball Carnival. With the drive and enthusiasm of players renewed in 2014-15, Tasmania sent two teams to compete in the Victorian Masters Baseball Carnival for the first time, the usual over 45's and the new over 35's. The over 35's were super competitive but failed to win a match whilst the over 45's played inspired team baseball to eventually win their first title, defeating the Big Cat Tomatoes in the Grand Final, 12-1. Off the field, the future of baseball was questioned as there was an absence of young players coming through the ranks. Southern Softball was experiencing a similar problem so Baseball Tasmania and the Southern Softball Association formed a joint venture to re- introduce t-ball to school children and through that, give them the skills and options to play baseball or softball. The Batter Up T-ball League was formed and the first games were played on Saturday 24 October 2015.  Season 2007-2008 Part 1 (Pre-Christmas)  Teams * Red Sox * Whitesox * Blue Jays * Green Bays The first season of the new league was a successful twilight league, with Sunday games occurring for the season opener and the finals series. After a relatively easy season, the Blue Jays were inaugurated as the league's first champion after defeating the Whitesox in the Grand Final.  Season 2007-2008 Part 2 (Post-Christmas)  Teams * Red Sox * Whitesox * Blue Jays * Green Bays * Gold Diggers * ~~Orange Ruffies~~ After some post- Christmas talent re-distribution and the creation of a fifth (the Gold Diggers) and sixth (the Orange Ruffies) team, the second season was a much closer affair and though the Blue Jays once again met the Whitesox in the Grand Final, the 'Sox would exact revenge for the first season loss. The Orange Ruffies would fold after just 2 games due to over-stretched playing personnel across all the teams and would be replaced with a Tasmanian Masters side that would play the Ruffies' scheduled opponent in an exhibition game for the remainder of the season.  Season 2008-2009  Teams * Red Sox * Whitesox * Blue Jays * Athletics (previously Green Bays) * ~~Royals~~ (previously Gold Diggers) The 2008-2009 season started with five teams but after only two weeks, the Royals team was folded due to lack of numbers and the remaining players were moved into the four original teams. Over 18 recorded rounds of competition, the league became divided with the Whitesox and Blue Jays once again fighting for the top spot while the Red Sox and Athletics showed positive signs but quickly lost touch with the other two teams. The Whitesox would go on to win the Grand Final, once again facing the Blue Jays.  Season 2009-2010  Teams * Athletics * Blue Jays * Red Sox * Whitesox A strong start to the season by the Blue Jays established the foundation for them to finish the season as minor premiers. For the first time, all four teams were involved in a traditional four-team finals system. The Red Sox were unfortunately decimated with injury and player departure and fell off as the season progressed, but the Athletics had unlocked some new talent and the Whitesox had returning players when the season entered the finals series. 1st Semi Final: Athletics def Red Sox 2nd Semi Final: Whitesox def Blue Jays Preliminary Final: Blue Jays def Athletics Grand Final: Whitesox def Blue Jays  Season 2010-2011  Teams * Athletics * Blue Jays * Red Sox * Whitesox The 2010/2011 season saw the first indication that early days of the Whitesox and Blue Jays dominating the competition were coming to an end with the Blue Jays falling from defending 4-time Minor Premier to wooden spooner. This did not stop the Whitesox from having another strong season, allowing them to capture their first Minor Premiership. But it would turn out that being minor premier was starting to show that it carried a curse with it. Despite being runaway contenders during the minor season, the Red Sox broke through for not only their first ever finals win, but also their maiden premiership, upsetting the defending champions in the Grand Final. 1st Semi Final: Athletics def Blue Jays 2nd Semi Final : Red Sox def Whitesox Preliminary Final: Whitesox def Athletics Grand Final: Red Sox def Whitesox  Season 2011-2012  Teams * Athletics * Blue Jays * Red Sox * Whitesox Despite starting the season with a 1-3-1 record, the Blue Jays won the final 12 games of the season (one round lost due to bad weather) to record the best ever regular season record for a team. This didn't bode well though as the team's fifth minor premiership may have heralded a fifth Grand Final appearance but the curse of the minor premier continued. An injury-plagued and departure riddle Whitesox fell to their first wooden spoon and the Athletics captured their maiden premiership when they easily accounted for the Blue Jays in the Grand Final. 1st Semi Final: Athletics def Red Sox 2nd Semi Final: Blue Jays def Whitesox Grand Final: Athletics def Blue Jays  Season 2012-13  Teams * Athletics * Blue Jays * Red Sox * White Sox  Champions  * Season I (2007): Blue Jays defeated Whitesox * Season II (2008): Whitesox defeated Blue Jays * Season III (2008‚Äì2009): Whitesox defeated Blue Jays * Season IV (2009‚Äì2010): Whitesox defeated Blue Jays * Season V (2010-2011): Red Sox defeated Whitesox * Season VI (2011-2012): Athletics defeated Blue Jays * Season VII (2012-2013): Athletics defeated Blue Jays * Season VIII (2013-2014): Eastern Athletics defeated Dragons * Season IX (2014-2015): Northern White Sox defeated Dragons  Team Records  * Most Premierships: Whitesox (3) * Most Grand Finals: Blue Jays (6) * Most Wooden Spoons: Athletics (Green Bays) (3) * Most Minor Premierships: Blue Jays (6) * Best Season Record: Blue Jays (2011/2012 - 13 wins, 3 losses, 1 draw) * Most Finals Wins: Whitesox (5)  External links  *Baseball Tasmania website Category:Sports governing bodies in Tasmania Tas ","title":"Baseball TAS"},{"id":"7692721","text":"Honinbo Retsugen (Êú¨Âõ†ÂùäÁÉàÂÖÉ, 1750‚Äì1808) was a Japanese professional go player, and tenth head of the Hon'inb≈ç house.

Some authors, for example John Fairbairn, have suggested that in this era the levels in China and in Japan were quite close, though since Japan was strictly closed this can only be argued on comparison of existing game records in very different styles. Retsugen was on the receiving end of the brilliance of the one player of the era who still has a high reputation, Yasui Senchi. Senchi was a pioneer of the kind of centrally- oriented play later revived and refined as shinfuseki in the 1930s.

Located next to the Grodzisk Mazowiecki County near Warsaw, it is often considered an outlying suburb of the capital of Poland but is in fact an independent entity administratively and culturally. Milan√≥wek is however part of wider Warsaw agglomeration. Located on the Middle Masovian Plain, between Grodzisk Mazowiecki and Pruszkow, the town has approximately 15,449 inhabitants. Milan√≥wek is served by Milan√≥wek railway station.  History  House in Milan√≥wek Milan√≥wek was established in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of parceling landbelonging to Micha≈Ç Lasocki, and lying along the Warsaw-Vienna Railway. Since the beginning, Milan√≥wek was a summer resort for wealthy residents of Warsaw, who set up lavish summer homes that often, when the owners decided to move permanently, were turned into grand villas. The most famous of the early holiday-makers was Polish writer, Boleslaw Prus. Another permanent resident of the town was sculptor Jan Szczepkowski. Developed in the interwar period, and still dominant in the older part of town, is some residential architecture. In the 1920s Central Experimental Station of Silk Production was founded. During World War II, an urn with the heart of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, transferred from Holy Cross Church in Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie in Warsaw, was stored in St. Hedwig Church in Milan√≥wek. During the Warsaw Uprising vital organs of Polish Underground State moved to Milan√≥wek and gave the town the nickname \\"Little London\\". In 1951 the town received city rights. In 1961 the city limits were extended, taking over villages including Nowa Wie≈õ (now this part of the city is called Milanowek Kazimier√≥wka). In the communist period there was further development of industry, especially the creation of a factory for surgical and dental instruments: \\"MIFAMA\\". After the administrative reform of 1999, Milan√≥wek became one of the six municipalities forming the district Grodziski.  Monuments  Monuments of Milanowek include the parish church of St. Hedwig, the \\"Turczynek\\" villa, accommodation for soldiers from World War II and many villas built between 1896 - 1945, including \\"Potƒôga\\", \\"Matulinek\\", \\"Hygea\\", and \\"Bor√≥wka\\". They are all in the national register of historic monuments (26 items). 388 pre-war villas and other valuable buildings in the middle of Milanowek have been included in the national register of historic monuments.

It is found associated with coral reefs and other rocky coastal habitats in a large part of the south-western Pacific including the Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea, the Caroline Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, Vanuatu, Fiji, Rotuma, Tonga, Samoa, and the Solomon Islands. The specific name honours the fisheries biologist Richard C. Wass.

Yamagata Prefecture in particular is famous for its imoni, but other prefectures in the region also have their own different varieties. Imoni is eaten like any soup, primarily during the late summer and early autumn, but is most famous as an outdoor food. In the autumn, groups of people preparing imoni around a fire near a river is considered a sign of the season, and convenience stores maintain a stock of firewood and other supplies just for the occasion. Ingredients The different recipes for imoni vary from prefecture to prefecture: for example, inland Yamagata imoni contains beef, sugar, and soy sauce and is sweet, while the imoni prepared in the neighbouring prefecture of Miyagi does not, but includes miso paste to flavour the soup. Similarly, even the Sh≈çnai region of Yamagata features a pork and miso base rather than the beef and soy sauce base of inland areas of the same prefecture. However, several ingredients are considered standard parts of the recipe: * Taro root (satoimo, Japanese: „Çµ„Éà„Ç§„É¢/„Åï„Å®„ÅÑ„ÇÇ, Kanji: ÈáåËäã) * Thinly sliced meat, typically beef or pork * konnyaku, dense jelly made from the konjac plant * soy sauce Other ingredients may include Chinese cabbage (hakusai), burdock root (gob≈ç), daikon, carrot, negi (Japanese green onion), mirin sake, tofu, mushrooms - in particular shimeji, hiratake, shiitake, maitake - and region-specific modifications. Culture In Yamagata Prefecture in particular, and its neighbours in general, imonikai (ËäãÁÖÆ‰ºö \\"imoni parties\\") are an important autumn tradition. Tourists flock to Yamagata for the Autumn Imoni Festival (Akino Imonikai) where they join local residents on the banks of the Mamigasaki River on the first Sunday in September, to eat imoni from a gigantic iron kettle, which uses a building crane to add ingredients and stir the pot. In 2009 the festival served imoni to 30,000 guests before the pot was empty.JNTO Website  Find a Location  Yamagata  Yamagata City and its surroundings Many schools and work organisations in Northern Japan arrange imonikai for their students or employees.

Laurentini. This technique assumes the foreground object in an image can be separated from the background. Under this assumption, the original image can be thresholded into a foreground/background binary image, which we call a silhouette image. The foreground mask, known as a silhouette, is the 2D projection of the corresponding 3D foreground object. Along with the camera viewing parameters, the silhouette defines a back-projected generalized cone that contains the actual object. This cone is called a silhouette cone. The upper right thumbnail shows two such cones produced from two silhouette images taken from different viewpoints. The intersection of the two cones is called a visual hull, which is a bounding geometry of the actual 3D object (see the bottom right thumbnail). In two dimensions A technique used in some modern touchscreen devices employs cameras placed in the corners situated opposite infrared LEDs. The one-dimensional projection (shadow) of objects on the surface may be used to reconstruct the convex hull of the object.

The narrative suggests that the individual freedom and agency of its protagonists is necessarily and inextricably intertwined with the empowerment of the community and nation as a whole.

Synopsis This book follows the general plot structure of Fast Food Nation but simplifies its predecessor's original content to make it more readable for younger children. The book is mainly a critique of the fast food industry. It tends to focus on McDonald's but covers all fast food in general. It goes on to mention production, labor conditions, and the negative health effects of fast food, production, and labor conditions. This book also retells the history of fast food, from the man who invented the first hamburgers to the creation of fast food companies. It covers such content as the way chickens die at a slaughterhouse; how meatpacking has become more dangerous than it was back in the times of the Chicago Stock Yards, cutting approximately 400 cattle an hour; and how the average child sees approximately 40,000 advertisements a year, half of which are for fast food, candy, breakfast cereals, and soda.  Publication details  The book has been published twice: once in hardcover, and once in paperback; including a new foreword. The paperback version of the book was first published in 2006 by Penguin Books. It has 318 pages.

It is a rather secluded hill situated at the western end of the long ridge which divides the Ennerdale and Buttermere valleys. Name The name Great Borne only really applies to the fell's summit area with most West Cumbrians actually referring to the fell as Herdus. However Bill Birkett in his Complete Lakeland Fells gives Great Borne and Herdus the status of separate fells, with Herdus‚Äô summit standing half a kilometre west of Great Borne with an altitude . The meaning of Great Borne translates from the French language meaning \\"Great Boundary\\" as in the 13th century the fell denoted the edge of the Loweswater forest, an alternative meaning has been put forward as \\"Great Stream\\" from the southern Old English language with bourne meaning a stream flowing from a spring. Topography and geology The subsidiary top of Bowness Knott, seen from Crag Fell Great Borne's southern slopes are of some interest, they fall away precipitously towards Ennerdale Water with steep crags and scree which are composed of pink granophyre rock which give these slopes a reddish tinge (see picture). Approximately halfway between Great Borne and the part of the fell labelled Herdus on the 1:50,000 O.S. map is the boundary between the Skiddaw Group and the Ennerdale Granophyre intrusion.The Geology of the Whitehaven and Workington district. T. Eastwood et al. pub. HMSO. 1931. page 49. The outlying low summit of Bowness Knott () also lies to the south. It is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), showing the granophyre in contact with Skiddaw Slate. Bowness Knott gives good views of Ennerdale Water and is an easy climb from the car park which lies at its foot. Historians have also found evidence of an old (possibly Middle Ages) field system on the lower southern slopes of Great Borne below the crags and scree. The northern flanks of the fell descend to the Floutern Pass, a pedestrian route between Ennerdale and Buttermere. To the east Great Borne is connected to the neighbouring fell of Starling Dodd by a ridge, while the western slopes descend quickly to the low ground of the west Cumbrian plain. Ascents Great Borne is customarily climbed from the Ennerdale side of the fell, with the car park beneath Bowness Knott being the usual starting point. The route follows Rake Beck for a short distance and skirts the Herdus crags on the eastern side to gain the summit. An ascent using the Floutern Pass is not recommended as the top of the pass is very boggy and the route rather circuitous. The route described in the Wainwright series of guidebooks is currently challenged by a nearby farmer Mr Ireland who has a strong antipathy to walkers and the National Park. Summit The summit of the fell has two separate tops divided by a shallow valley, the south top is slightly higher and is marked by an Ordnance Survey trig point and a considerable wind shelter while the northern top has a large cairn which is visible for miles around and gives extensive views of the Loweswater Fells. This large cairn is thought to be the boundary marker from which the fell takes its name.

In simpler terms, it is a psychological method for people to turn off \\"inner protests\\" when they do, or are about to do something they themselves perceive as wrong. The theory The idea of such techniques was first postulated by David Matza (born May 1, 1930) and Gresham Sykes (born 1922) during their work on Edwin Sutherland's Differential Association in the 1950s. While Matza and Sykes were at the time working on juvenile delinquency, they hypothocized that the same techniques could be found throughout society and published their ideas in Delinquency and Drift 1964.http://home.comcast.net/~ddemelo/crime/sykes_matza.html Matza and Sykes' hypothesis states that people are always aware of their moral obligation to abide by the law, and that they have the same moral obligation within themselves to avoid illegitimate acts. Thus, they reasoned, when a person did commit illegitimate acts, they must employ some sort of mechanism to silence the urge to follow these moral obligations. This hypothesis rejects other theories which suggested that groups containing delinquents have set up their own permanent moral code which completely replaces moral obligations. Thus, Matza and Sykes were able to explain how offenders 'drift' from illegitimate to legitimate lifestyles repeatedly, as they retain the moral code rather than wipe it clean to be replaced by a more illegitimate one as previous theories suggested. The techniques The theory was built up upon four observations: * Delinquents express guilt over their illegal acts. * Delinquents frequently respect and admire honest, law-abiding individuals. * A line is drawn between those whom they can victimize and those they cannot. * Delinquents are not immune to the demands of conformity. These theories were brought from positivistic criminology which looked at epistemological perspectives of delinquency. From these, Matza and Sykes created the following methods by which, they believed, delinquents justified their illegitimate actions: * Denial of responsibility. The offender will propose that they were victims of circumstance or were forced into situations beyond their control. * Denial of injury. The offender insists that their actions did not cause any harm or damage. * Denial of the victim. The offender believes that the victim deserved whatever action the offender committed. * Condemnation of the condemners. The offenders maintain that those who condemn their offense are doing so purely out of spite, or are shifting the blame off of themselves unfairly. * Appeal to higher loyalties. The offender suggests that his or her offense was for the greater good, with long term consequences that would justify their actions, such as protection of a friend. There are five methods of neutralization generally manifest themselves in the form of arguments, such as: * \\"It wasn't my fault\\" * \\"It wasn't a big deal. They could afford the loss\\" * \\"They had it coming\\" * \\"You were just as bad in your day\\" * \\"My friends needed me. What was I going to do?\\"Techniques Of Neutralization In 2017, Bryant et al. analysed statements made by 27 individuals accused of participation in the Rwanda genocide and found two neutralization techniques that had not been identified before: * Appeal to good character. The offender will \\"assert their good deeds or admirable character attributes that they contend render them incapable of committing (genocidal) crimes\\". * Victimisation. The offender will argue how she, he, people close to him or his ethnic group were under threat or have suffered loss by a third party (in case of the Rwanda genocide the Tutsi). In 2018 Muel Kaptein and Martien van Helvoort have developed a model, called the Amoralizations Alarm Clock, that covers all existing amoralizations in a logical way. Amorializations, also called neutralizations, or rationalizations, are defined as justifications and excuses for deviant behavior. Amoralizations are important explanations for the rise and persistence of deviant behavior. There exist many different and overlapping techniques of amoralizations. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2018.1491696 Acceptance Further research in the hypothesis has produced inconclusive results. Offenders have been found both with a solid belief in their moral obligations, and without. Travis Hirschi, a social bond theorist, also raised the question as to whether the offender develops these techniques to neutralise their qualms regarding offending before or after they actually commit the offence.Sykes and Matza's Techniques of Neutralization (Drift Theory) The Neutralization Hypothosis was introduced by Sykes and Matza in 1957, facing the then prevailing criminological wisdom that offenders engage in crime because they adhere to an oppositional subcultural rule set that values law breaking and violence, they rejected this perspective. Subsequent research revealed that the original formulation of the Sykes and Matza's theory explains only the behavior of \\"conventionally attached individuals\\" not those of \\"nonconventionally oriented individuals\\" such as \\"criminally embedded street offenders\\". Professor Volkan Topalli, at Georgia State University, in his article The Seductive Nature of Autotelic Crime: How Neutralization Theory Serves as a Boundary Condition for Understanding Hardcore Street Offending, explains that for those groups \\"guilt is not an issue at all because their crimes are not only considered acceptable, but attractive and desirable\\".TOPALLI, Volkan, Prof. The Seductive Nature of Autotelic Crime: How Neutralization Theory Serves as a Boundary Condition for Understanding Hardcore Street Offending, Digital Object Identifier 10.1111/j.1475-682X.2006.00167.x See also Amoralizations https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2018.1491696 * Deviance (sociology) * Criminology * Ethnomethodology * Rationalization (psychology) * Social order * Social control * Tu quoque * Victim blaming References Category:Ethics Category:Criminology ","title":"Techniques of neutralization"},{"id":"7692867","text":"Gabriel Scognamillo (27 October 1906 ‚Äì 31 May 1974) was an Italian art director.

It is basal to the Columba-Streptopelia radiation. Their ancestors diverged from that lineage probably over 8 million years ago. While the biogeographic pattern of this group suggests that the ancestors of the typical pigeons and turtle-doves settled the Old World from the Americas, Patagioenas may just as well be the offspring of Old World pigeons which only radiated into different genera later, given that the cuckoo-doves (Macropygia) of Southeast Asia also seem to be closely related.Johnson et al. (2001), Cheke (2005) Taxonomy The genus Patagioenas was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853 with the white-crowned pigeon (Patagioenas leucocephala) as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek patage≈ç meaning \\"to clatter\\" and oinas meaning \\"pigeon\\". There are 17 species of Patagioenas, which can be assigned to 4 groups based on mtDNA cytochrome b, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, as well as the nuclear Œ≤-fibrinogen intron 7 data combined with analyses of vocalizations and morphology. They could be considered subgenera, but one of them remains unnamed as such and thus they are only informally listed here:Johnson et al.

Apparently the most basal group. * Band-tailed pigeon, Patagioenas fasciata * Chilean pigeon, Patagioenas araucana * Ring-tailed pigeon, Patagioenas caribaea leucocephala group (Patagioenas sensu stricto): Iridescent neck and dark plumage, or white edged outer wing coverts, or scaly appearance; groups of triple coos with the first call in each drawn out except in speciosa * White-crowned pigeon, Patagioenas leucocephala * Scaly-naped pigeon, Patagioenas squamosa * Scaled pigeon, Patagioenas speciosa * Picazuro pigeon, Patagioenas picazuro * Bare- eyed pigeon, Patagioenas corensis * Spot-winged pigeon, Patagioenas maculosa cayennensis group: No display plumage except iridescent head in cayennensis; groups of double or triple coos with the first call in each short * Pale- vented pigeon, Patagioenas cayennensis * Red-billed pigeon, Patagioenas flavirostris * Maranon pigeon, Patagioenas oenops * Plain pigeon, Patagioenas inornata plumbea group (Oenoenas): Small size, plain plumage, rounded tails, small bills, phrase composed of high single coos * Plumbeous pigeon, Patagioenas plumbea * Ruddy pigeon, Patagioenas subvinacea * Short-billed pigeon, Patagioenas nigrirostris * Dusky pigeon, Patagioenas goodsoni A fossil species (Curtis pigeon) initially placed in Chloroenas, Patagioenas micula (Early Pliocene of Curtis Ranch, USA) is known.

By this decree, all clocks in the Soviet Union were permanently shifted one hour ahead at 00:00 on 21 June 1930 everywhere in the Soviet Union. Applicability of this decree was further extended by two other decrees in 1930 and 1931. The practice was further extended, and its legal basis was amended, in 1980. It is independent from daylight saving time, which was introduced in the USSR much later, in 1981. In fact, with both time shifts in effect, summer time was two hours ahead of standard time in the USSR. From 1982 to 1986, decree time was gradually abolished by the Soviet government in 30 oblasts and autonomous Republics of the Russian SFSR. In the late 1980s, it was further abolished in the Baltic republics, Ukraine and Moldavia, followed by the entire territory of the Soviet Union in March 1991 (eight months before its dissolution). On 23 October 1991, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR ruled to restore decree time in Russia. It was restored on 19 January 1992 at 02:00, with the following exemptions: *the Kaliningrad Oblast was permitted to use Eastern European Time instead of Moscow Time; *all federal subjects that would have to use Samara Time in absence of this exemption (Adygea, most part of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Astrakhan Oblast, Chechnya, Chuvashia, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Ivanovo Oblast, Kabardino-Balkaria, Kalmykia, Karachay-Cherkessia, Kostroma Oblast, Kirov Oblast, Krasnodar Krai, Lipetsk Oblast, Mari El, Mordovia, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, North Ossetia-Alania, Penza Oblast, Rostov Oblast, Ryazan Oblast, Samara Oblast, Saratov Oblast, Stavropol Krai, Tambov Oblast, Tatarstan, Udmurtia, Ulyanovsk Oblast, Vladimir Oblast, Volgograd Oblast, Vologda Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, Yaroslavl Oblast) were permitted to use Moscow Time instead; *the whole Arkhangelsk Oblast and Komi Republic were permitted to use Moscow Time; *the Tyumen Oblast was permitted to use Yekaterinburg Time instead of Omsk Time; and *the whole Krasnoyarsk Krai was permitted to use Krasnoyarsk Time (its easternmost parts would have to use Irkutsk Time otherwise). Most of these exemptions are equivalent to abolition of decree time in corresponding territories. At present, all these federal subjects use the exemptions.

Design and development Development of the nine-cylinder engine was led by Capt. George Thomas Smith-Clarke. The prototype engine, called 9ARS and which weighed 693 lb and developed 450 hp, was run in December 1936. In 1938 Airspeed (1934) Ltd lent their test pilot, George Errington, and their much rebuilt Bristol Bulldog (K3183), to carry out test flights. Development was continued at a reduced pace during the Second World War and following testing in an Airspeed Oxford and an Airspeed Consul (VX587). Alvis was ready to market the engine in 1947 as the Series 500 (502, 503 and sub-types) for aeroplanes and Series 520 for helicopters. (Most helicopter engines were direct drive ‚Äî no reduction gearbox ‚Äî with a centrifugal clutch and fan cooling). The first production use was the Percival Prince, which flew in July 1948 and the Westland Sikorsky S-51 and Westland WS-51 Dragonfly helicopters. From 1959 the stroke was increased to 4.8 inches for the Series 530 (mainly the Mk. 531 for Twin Pioneers) rated at 640 hp. It was Britain's last high- power production piston aero-engine when manufacture ceased in 1966.

Packing is commonly practiced by trans men. People who cross- dress as male may also \\"pack\\". Packers The object used for packing, sometimes called a packer, may take the form of only a penis shape or may also incorporate a false scrotum and testicles. Packers may be used to make male clothing hang and move correctly. If a packer is not used, the shape of the clothing is sometimes visibly \\"empty\\".FTM Guide - Packing =Soft packing= The phrase \\"soft packing\\" refers to packing with a device that cannot be used for sexual penetration. Homemade packers may be very low-tech and consist of rolled-up socks or condoms filled with liquids or gel. There are many commercially available packers, which more realistically emulate the size, shape, color and texture of the male genitals. All soft packers are made of soft, flexible material and simulate a flaccid penis. The term packer most frequently describes the soft models not used for sexual activity. A few packers can be used as stand-to-pee devices (STP). These incorporate a receptacle that is inserted under and against the wearer's urethra. The packer has a tube from the receptacle to the tip, which allows the wearer to urinate through the prosthetic. =For sex= Packing hard refers to packing with a device that may be used for sexual penetration. Some such packers are made of firmer material such as silicone, and are flexible enough for packing but firm enough for sexual penetration. Still others are made of even firmer material, and feature either an internal rod that stays in the shape in which it is bent, or an internal hinge at the base. These types allowing the packer to simulate a flaccid position (if not a flaccid feel), as well as a very firm, erect position. Another term for packers which may be used for sex is packing dildo. A colloquial expression for the usage of these is pack and play. Slang The protruding bulge appearance that some crossdressers and trans men attempt to attain is sometimes known by the informal terms moose-knuckle or man-bulge. A slang term related to packing is packing heat. This slang term originally meant carrying a firearm, but later was used to describe an FTM trans person who has a penis. Like many terms in many communities, this phrase may be used affectionately or jokingly among friends, as a way of reclaiming a phrase that is used as a pejorative.

It served the village of Barnby Dun, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. The original line followed closely the canal bank and the station was resited when the line was 'straightened' in the 1860s. The original station, which was situated across the canal from the village, was opened with the line on 7 July 1856 and closed on 1 October 1866 when the new station, at the opposite side of the village was opened. The rebuilt station consisted of flanking platforms with its main buildings, in yellow engineers brick, on the Thorne-bound (up) platform. This platform was long, with a ramp to a barrow crossing to the 'down' side at its centre. The station was again rebuilt to accommodate four tracks in the Doncaster to Thorne widening of 1913 when the Doncaster-bound (down) platform was moved back. The station closed on 4 September 1967.

The original passenger station opened with the coming of passenger services to the line on 7 July 1856 and closed on 1 October 1866 when the station was resited on the 'straightened' line.

Female Shembe congregants. The Nazareth Baptist Church (Alternatively called \\"The Nazarite Church\\" \\"iBandla lamaNazaretha\\") is the second largest, African initiated church based in South Africa, founded in 1910. It reveres Shembe as a prophet sent by God to restore the teachings of Moses, the prophets, and Jesus. Members are Sabbath-observers and avoid pork, smoking, and premarital sex. It was divided into two groups after the 1976 death of Johannes Galilee Shembe. The larger group was led by Bishop Amos Shembe until his death in 1995, while Rev. Londa Shembe led the smaller group. As of 2009, it was divided into three factions in KwaZulu-Natal and one in Gauteng. The religion uses leopard skins as part of their ceremonies, which some activists are trying to stop or replace with synthetic leopard skin.Shembe snarl at mock leopard skin On 18 October 2016, the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban declared Vela Shemba the legitimate leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church after a protracted court battle, which had dragged on since 2011. Despite this, the previous leader's son Mduduzi Shembe, who lives in the large village of Ebuhleni, remains the de facto head of the church and most church members have ignored the ruling. Pilgrimages The Shembe begin each year with a Holy pilgrimage to iNhlangakazi, but approximately 6.7 million followers of AmaNazaretha no longer go to Inhlangakazi because of court interdicts. As a result, iNkosi uNyazi LweZulu avoided court battles and founded Mount Khenana which is at Ozwathini, on the first Sunday of the New Year. It is said that Isaiah Shembe was drawn to the area where the Holy Spirit told him to start the Church. They also hold a month-long celebration in Judea near Eshowe every year in October, where members gather to receive the blessings of Shembe. World Cup legal challenge In early 2010 the Nazareth Baptist Church claimed that the vuvuzela horn, used by fans attending football matches in South Africa, actually belongs to their church. They threatened to pursue legal action to stop supporters from playing the vuvuzela at the South African World Cup, but no legal proceedings were initiated.  Vodacom partnership  In April 2017 a partnership between the African mobile communications company Vodacom and the Vela Shembe faction was announced in which the church would distribute Vodacom products and services. Landile Shembe, the Shembe Family Trust representative, stated that the faction had 6.7 million members of which approximately 2.4 million subscribed to Vodafone.

Ferris made his full Ireland debut against Pacific Islanders in November 2006. Ferris was selected for the Ireland Rugby World Cup squad in 2007 but was an unused reserve at the tournament. Injury ruled Ferris out of the 2008 Six Nations, but good early season form for Ulster saw him rewarded with three further caps during Ireland's end of year campaign. He earned his fifth Irish cap against Australia in June 2008. He retained his place for the following year's Six Nations and was an ever-present as Declan Kidney's side clinched the Grand Slam.

The Easey Street murders, often simplified to just Easey Street, refer to the knife murders of two women in January 1977 in the inner Melbourne suburb of Collingwood. Described as \\"Victoria‚Äôs most brutal crime\\", the case remains unsolved despite a $1m reward being posted in 2017.  Background  Suzanne Armstrong (28), a single mother who had had a child while travelling in Greece, and Susan Bartlett (27), a schoolteacher at the Collingwood Education Centre, were old high-school friends from regional Benalla who had moved to Melbourne. They had rented the property at Easey Street in October 1976, 10 weeks prior to the killings. Their terrace house consisted of a long corridor with three bedrooms, leading to a rear kitchen, bathroom, and backyard area. On the night of the attack, Bartlett's brother and his girlfriend had visited for dinner before watching TV and leaving around 9:00 pm.  Murders  Police believe that Armstrong and Bartlett were both killed on the night of 10 January 1977. The women had been stabbed multiple times - Armstrong 29 times and Bartlett 55 times. Armstrong's body was found on her bed whereas Bartlett's was found in the hallway near the front door (which was next to Armstrong's bedroom). Neighbours first noted a problem when they retrieved a pet dog, a German shepherd puppy, belonging to the two which had been wandering the area the next day. Neighbours had also heard Armstrong's 16-month-old son, Gregory, whimpering in the days after the attack. Finally, three days after they were killed, they entered via the back door and he was found unharmed but distressed and dehydrated in his cot. The women's bodies were also discovered. Investigation When police investigated the scene, there were no signs of forced entry \\\\- though a footprint on the front window sill indicated a possible entry point. They also noted that the killer had cleaned up in the bathroom after the killings and exited via the back door and the lane-way gate, leaving them both open. The kitchen light was left on and a murder weapon was not found. A note from Armstrong's new boyfriend, who had visited the property with his brother (who was Bartlett's sister's boyfriend) via the back door on 12 January at around 8:30 pm was also found on the kitchen table. Police eventually established a list of 130 'persons of interest' related to the case. The list included construction workers who were in the process of building at 365 Hoddle Street - the property behind the house. Media also reported that the women had been sexually assaulted as well. Armstrong had been raped postmortem and a semen sample was found at the scene. In 1999, detectives DNA tested the case's eight prime suspects, one of whom had returned to the UK, without success. The murders were later linked to the disappearance and probable murder of Julie Garciacelay, a librarian originally from Stockton, California. Garciacelay had disappeared from her North Melbourne, Victoria apartment on 1 July 1975. The suspect in that case, a crime reporter and work friend of Garciacelay, had been staying in the house next to the Easey Street killings on the night of the attacks. However, despite investigations by a team of 16 detectives, the crime remains unsolved. In 2011, however, the cold case was quietly re-opened under the supervision of Ron Iddles. On 15 January 2017, 40 years after the murders, Victoria Police offered a reward of up to $1 million for information to the apprehension and subsequent conviction of the person or persons responsible for the attacks.  Legacy  Gregory Armstrong was adopted and raised in Queensland by his mother's younger sister, who has also continually advocated for the solving of the case in the media. Interest in the case has persisted, particularly when the property was sold (after remaining vacant for six years) in 1983, then in 2011, and again in 2017. Australian artist Steve Cox lived in Easey Street, diagonally opposite to the murder house, between 1978 and 1979. He later made a number of artworks based on this case. A book by Tom Prior, They trusted men: The untold story of the Easy Street murders, was published in 1996. In June 2018, Andrew Rule released a podcast on the case called The horror at Easey St. In March 2019, a book by Helen Thomas called Murder on Easey Street: Melbourne's Most Notorious Cold Case () was published. In April-May 2019, Unsolved Murders: True Crime Stories ran a 2-part dramatised episode on the case.

Situated at the southern end of the Long Range Mountains at the western mouth of the Codroy Valley, the name originated because high winds - often well in excess of hurricane force - would occasionally blow railway cars on the narrow gauge trains operated by the Newfoundland Railway completely off the track.Weather Doctor Almanac 2005 The word \\"Wreckhouse\\" was added to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary in 2004. Although the railway was closed in 1988, the winds are still a hazard to vehicles on Highway 1 and transport trucks occasionally get blown off the road. Lockie MacDougall, a farmer and trapper, was born in 1896 and lived at Wreckhouse. He had a natural sixth sense to the changes in the weather and this ability allowed him to be employed by Robert Gillespie Reid, whose company built the Newfoundland Railway. MacDougall was paid 20 dollars a month and would inform the railway if it was safe for trains to pass, performing this task for thirty years until his death in 1965. His wife, Emily, continued on with the task until she moved away from the area in 1972. Today, one can see Lockie's face painted in a mural on the side of local pizza establishment, Louis Gees in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador. An anemometer operated by the Meteorological Service of Canada currently provides remote wind data for the Newfoundland and Labrador weather office in Gander which distributes warnings to travellers should the speed be sufficient. The term Wreckhouse Winds is used by the MSC to specifically refer to dangerous wind conditions in this geographic area.Meteorological Service of Canada - Public Alerting Criteria - Wind Table Mountain as seen from Wreckhouse Popular culture Wreckhouse also provides inspiration for Wreckhouse Jazz & Blues,Wreckhouse Jazz & Blues Website producers of the Wreckhouse International Jazz & Blues Festival.wreckhousejazzandblues.com References Category:Geography of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Wreckhouse, Newfoundland and Labrador"},{"id":"7693114","text":"Matt McCullough (born 9 September 1981) is a retired Irish rugby union footballer.

Born in Glasgow, he was the son of Alexander and Mary Baird. After leaving school he worked initially as a coalminer, before attending St. Mungo's Medical School to study dentistry. He qualified in 1929, and was admitted to the Royal Faculty Physicians and Surgeons. In 1933 he married Agnes Kerr of Castle Douglas, and the couple had 2 children. In 1928 Baird become active in Labour politics in Glasgow. He continued to be a member of the Labour Party when he moved his dental practice firstly to the north of England and then later to the London area. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Baird joined the Army Dental Corps, reaching the rank of captain by the war's end. He was first elected to the House of Commons in the Labour landslide at the 1945 general election, when he defeated the long- serving Liberal MP, Geoffrey Mander. When his constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, Baird was returned to Parliament for the new Wolverhampton North East. He held that seat until he stepped down at the 1964 general election. In parliament he took an interest in health and social insurance issues. He was a strong opponent of racism, and also sought to form better relations with Communist countries, visiting the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China on a number of occasions.

The house itself has been much altered in modern times, but retains a picturesque 15th century gate tower. Tilsworth f√™te is held in the grounds each June. The manor was owned in the 16th century by the Fowler family. In 1600 a notorious trial followed a quarrel between Richard Fowler and his young wife. Richard was imprisoned in the Tower of London as the result of a forged letter implicating him in a plot to poison Queen Elizabeth I. His wife, her brother and her lover were convicted of the forgery.B. N. de Luna, The Mortal Shakespeare: Some New Light on His Political and Personal Relationships, 1580‚Äì1616, c.1993.

Several old farmhouses, two of them thatched, survive in Tilsworth. There are new houses and bungalows, but the village has not yet increased greatly in size. One farmhouse in the north corner of the parish was lost to Hockliffe, to which it was adjacent, in the 20th century.

It was first produced on the stage at the Saville Theatre, London, on 23 April 1958. Its book was written by Wolf Mankowitz and Julian More, with music by David Heneker and Monty Norman, also the co-lyricist with Julian More. The production starred Paul Scofield with Hy Hazell, Millicent Martin and James Kenney. Musical director was Burt Rhodes and director William Chappell. The subsequent 1959 film version was directed by Val Guest and starred Laurence Harvey, Cliff Richard, and Yolande Donlan. Paul Scofield appeared in the original stage version Plot Paul Scofield played Johnny, a slimy, small- time music promoter and talent scout who notices teenage girls going crazy for the singing and bongo playing of talentless and seemingly idiotic Herbert Rudge (played by James Kenney). Johnny rechristens Rudge as \\"Bongo Herbert\\" and signs him to a contract that gives Johnny a 50% share of the profits. With Johnny's help, Bongo rockets to stardom. Bongo's success attracts a host of sleazy music industry types intent on exploiting him. Johnny quickly finds himself outclassed in the sleaze department as Bongo turns out to be the slipperiest slime of them all. Music The writers of the 1958 musical were inspired by songwriters such as No√´l Coward. (David Heneker said his musical career was inspired by reading the score of Noel Coward's Bitter Sweet). Their lyrics were clever, wordy and allusive: \\"The Gravy Train\\", for example, has Johnny quoting an apt line from Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, (Act 5, Scene X), while the unrepentant shopaholics in \\"We Bought It\\" describe themselves as \\"two eccentric socialites, dissipated sybarites\\".

The Assembly of the Six Counties () was an assembly of Patriote leaders and approximately 6,000 followers held in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) on October 23 and October 24, 1837, despite the June 15 Proclamation of the government forbidding public assemblies.\\"The Grand Assembly of the Six Counties\\", HCO, retrieved Sept. 17, 2011 Presided by Wolfred Nelson, it is the most famous of the various public assemblies held during that year protesting the Russell Resolutions. It is a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. The \\"six counties\\" refer to Richelieu, Rouville, Saint-Hyacinthe, Chambly, Verch√®res and L'Acadie.  History  The Ninety-Two Resolutions of the Patriotes had demanded Great Britain democratic reforms for Lower Canada. They had been mostly denied by the Russell Resolutions, which sparked a number of assemblies of protest in 1837. The Saint-Charles assembly was attended by 13 members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. On the field, a column, the Colonne de la libert√©, had been raised with the inscription \\"√Ä Papineau ses compatriotes reconnaissants\\" (\\"To Papineau his thankful compatriots\\"). A replica, inaugurated in 1982, stands today on the site. It saw the speeches of the likes of Louis-Joseph Papineau and Wolfred Nelson. Papineau advocated the pursuit of the constitutional struggle through economic boycotts of British products while Nelson and Doctor Cyrille C√¥t√© supported an armed uprising. \\"I claim the time has come to melt our spoons to make bullets\\", thundered Nelson. √âtienne Parent also spoke and supported non-forceful methods. The assembly voted a number of resolutions, as did the other 1837 assemblies. They notably proclaimed human rights, refused to recognize the new Executive Council of Lower Canada and approved the Soci√©t√© des fils de la libert√©. They did not mention the use of force. This event prompted the negative reaction of the Lower Canada Church. At a banquet in honour of Bishop Ignace Bourget (himself one of the relatively rare clerics in favour of the Patriotes), Bishop Jean-Jacques Lartigue declared: \\"Never is it permitted to transgress laws of to revolt against the legitimate authority under which people have the joy of living\\". Three weeks after the assembly, an arrest warrant for Patriote leaders was issued by the government.

He made one appearance for the All Blacks in 2002. Playing career =Provincial Rugby= Steinmetz made his debut for Wellington in 1997, but spent most of his first few seasons for the province as a reserve on a deep and talented squad. In 2000, he made 10 appearances including two starts in helping Wellington win the NPC championship. In 2001, he finally solidified a starting position in the Wellington backs, which he held down through the remainder of his time with the province. His final match for Wellington before heading overseas was the 2003 NPC final. =Super Rugby= Steinmetz made his debut for the Hurricanes in the 2000 Super 12 season, but saw very limited action in his first season. In 2001 he made more of an impression, scoring 3 tries for the Hurricanes, but still found starts difficult to come by. For the 2002, Steinmetz was drafted to the Highlanders and had the finest season of his career to that point. He started every game for the club and scored 5 tries as they advanced to the semi-finals of the competition. He returned to the Highlanders for the 2003 season, and continued as a starter, scoring another three tries. However, it would be his last season in New Zealand as he signed for Ulster for the following campaign. =Europe= Steinmetz signed with Ulster in 2003 and went on to spend 6 seasons with the Irish province. His appearances in his final two seasons were limited as he made the transition to player-coach and served as the team's backs coach in 2008‚Äì09. He scored his final first-class try in a Heineken Cup match against Stade Fran√ßais on 24 January and retired as a player at the conclusion of the season. =International Rugby= A standout 2002 season saw Steinmetz earning All Black notice for the first time, and he was added to the squad for the end of year tour as an injury replacement after Carlos Spencer and Keith Lowen were ruled out. He was an unused substitute for the test against France and on 23 November came on as a substitute in the 77th minute of a victory against Wales. It would be the only international appearance for Steinmetz, who fell back down the pecking order in 2003 and left New Zealand to play abroad after the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

Although the term is archaic and not commonly used, junior barristers (or \\"juniors\\") can also be referred to as utter barristers derived from \\"outer barristers\\" or barristers of the outer bar, in distinction to Queen's Counsel at the inner bar. They may also be referred to as stuff gownsmen, in contradistinction to the silk gowns worn by Queen's Counsel (who are therefore also known as \\"silks\\"). When students are called to the bar in jurisdictions which maintain barristers as a separate profession, they are said to be \\"called to the Degree of an Utter Barrister...\\" on their certificate of call. This reflects that in English court rooms Queen's Counsel sits one row further forward than junior barristers (historically, the Attorney General sits one row further forward still, although the Attorney General appears so rarely in court in modern times that the convention has largely been abandoned in that respect). Because a relatively small proportion of barristers become Queen's Counsel, it is quite common for a \\"junior barrister\\" to be middle aged. Junior barristers who are over 10 years' call are sometimes referred to as \\"senior juniors\\".

The marketing strategy of pull strategy aims to create a demand vacuum through advertising and promotion to the consumer.

History The bureau was created 13 December 1898 as the Division of Customs and Insular Affairs within the Office of the Secretary of War.\\"Records of the Bureau of Insular Affairs\\" This followed the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, which resulted in the transfer of several areas from Spain to the United States, including the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. The bureau supervised the customs and civil affairs of these areas. The word \\"insular\\" was already associated with Cuba and Puerto Rico because the Spanish had created autonomous \\"insular\\" governments for both islands in February 1898. In 1900, the name was changed to Division of Insular Affairs, and in 1902 it became the Bureau of Insular Affairs.\\"The Philippine Bill of July 1, 1902\\" As a result of the Insular Cases, the U.S. Attorney General issued an opinion in 1915 stating that the insular areas were unincorporated territories of the United States. In 1939, the bureau was replaced by the Division of Territories and Island Possessions in the Department of the Interior. This division was later renamed the Office of Insular Affairs. Puerto Rico From 1898 to 1900 and again in 1909‚Äì1934, the Bureau was responsible for the administration of Puerto Rico, called \\"Porto Rico\\" in official U.S. government documents until 1932. Puerto Rico, also an unincorporated territory of the United States, was administered under a civil government created by the Foraker Act of 1900, amended by the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act of 1917. In 1934, the Bureau's functions for Puerto Rico were transferred to the Division of Territories and Island Possessions (later the Office of Territories and still later the Office of Territorial Affairs) within the Department of the Interior. Cuba The bureau's other responsibilities included oversight of Cuba, although those responsibilities were not clearly defined. From 1906‚Äì1909, it administered the sovereign Republic of Cuba during the Second Occupation of Cuba. In 1904‚Äì1905, it briefly had oversight of the Panama Canal. In 1905‚Äì1939, it administered the Dominican customs receivership, and in 1920‚Äì1924 it administered the Haitian customs receivership. However, the bureau was never responsible for Hawaii, which was administered pursuant to an Organic Act giving it the status of an incorporated territory, or for American Samoa, Guam, or the United States Virgin Islands, all of which were administered during these years by the United States Navy Department. Philippines The bureau was responsible for civil aspects of the Philippine government from 1898 to 1935. The United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands was replaced by the Insular Government following the Spooner Amendment of 1901. Befitting its organization within the War Department, the chief of the bureau was always an army general. The longest-tenured chiefs were Brig. Gen. Clarence R. Edwards, who served from 1902 to 1912, and Maj. Gen. Frank McIntyre, who served from 1912 to 1929. Future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter served briefly as a law officer for the bureau beginning in 1911.

The mountain is an ancient volcanic structure, circular in shape, that rises from flat surrounding plains. It is formed by three concentric ridges or rings of hills, of which the outermost has a diameter of about 24 km. The Pilanesberg is located 100 km to the North-West of Pretoria and is for the greater part enclosed in a protected area known as Pilanesberg Game Reserve. The Elands River flows South of the Pilanesberg in an Easterly direction. There are a number of platinum mines right at the perimeter of the crater formation. The name \\"Pilanes\\" comes from a historic Tswana chief named Pilane. Geology Although geographically located within the Witwatersrand range, the mountain is geologically part of a feature known as the Pilanesberg Alkaline Ring Complex.Wikimapia - Pilanesberg Alkaline Ring Complex It is a vast ring dike of a very ancient extinct volcano that last erupted some 1,200 million years ago. The Pilanesberg is one of the largest volcanic complexes of its type, there are few similar alkaline volcanic structures in the world. Different types of syenites, including a number of rare minerals, occur in the crater area.Mindat - Pilanesberg Mt The formation of the Pilanesberg occurred 2 billion years ago. As its zenith, the volcano towered to 7,000 metres in height. Over the time, a series of volcanic eruptions occurred. There were further outpourings of lava, craters collapsed, ring fracturing took place around the volcano and magma was squeezed into these fractures. The end result is several \\"onion rings\\" of rocks of different ages. Erosion over many millions of years has stripped away the mountain and the highest peak. What we see today is not so much a volcanic crater, but a cross section through the magma pipes that were located at great depth below the mountain's summit.

Any difference between the two generates a compensating error voltage which tends to move the output voltage towards the design specification. An error amplifier is essentially what its name says, that is, it amplifies an error signal. This error is based on the difference between a reference signal and the input signal. It can also be treated as the difference between the two inputs. These are usually used in unison with feedback loops, owing to their self-correcting mechanism. They have an inverting and a non-inverting input pin set, which is what is responsible for the output to be the difference of the inputs.

A native of Belfast, he attended Rockport School and Campbell College. He was a member of the Ireland U19 side (which also included Brian O'Driscoll) that lifted the U19 World Cup in 1998. He was a member of the Ireland Grand Slam winning team of 2009. 2001/02 Season Wallace burst on to the scene at the beginning of the 2001/02 season putting in a number of top class performances from fullback or out-half for Ulster. His wacky sidesteps and flamboyant goose-steps made him a favourite with the Ravenhill supporters. He soon became a regular and was selected to play for Ireland A against the touring New Zealand All Blacks at Ravenhill. Although Ireland lost 43‚Äì30 Wallace put in an extremely accomplished performance as well as kicking 20 points. He was a regular in both the Ulster and Ireland A teams for the remainder of the season, indeed helping the Ireland A team to a Shadow 6 Nations Triple Crown. 2002/03 Season Wallace began the 2002/03 season as Ulster's first choice fullback but a broken leg in a Celtic League game away to Swansea at St. Helens meant he would miss the majority of the remainder of the season. He would return in time though to help his club, Ballymena, win the AIB All Ireland League Title, defeating Clontarf in the final at Lansdowne Road. 2003/04 Season He began the 2003/04 season in the Number 10 shirt for Ulster due to David Humphreys absence because of the impending Rugby World Cup in Australia. After fellow Ulster player Johnny Bell was ruled out of the tournament with an achilles tendon injury the uncapped Wallace was called up to the Ireland Squad. Although a great experience for the young Wallace he saw no game time. When he returned to Ulster, he had lost his place at fullback to the ever-consistent Bryn Cunningham, and the No10 slot to the returning David Humpreys. It seems in hindsight the best thing for Wallace would actually have been to stay with Ulster and play regular Celtic League rugby. Having been left out of the squad for the opening Heineken Cup game away to the Newport Gwent Dragons he was drafted into the 22 for the visit of French giants Stade Fran√ßais to Ravenhill after an injury to Australian international centre Ryan Constable. He would come on as a second-half replacement for Bryn Cunningham and score the winning try. This secured the talented Wallace the Ulster Number 15 shirt for the next series of games including the 27‚Äì21 defeat of Edinburgh to lift the Celtic Cup, Ulster's first piece of silverware since the famous 1999 European Cup triumph, and the 33‚Äì0 thumping of Leicester Tigers at Ravenhill in January 2004, in the return leg of the Tigers' fixture though he had a torrid time playing at full-back and was relegated to the bench for the majority of the remainder of the season. Wallace had 3 more starts that season, twice at outside centre and once again at fullback, all due to injuries to other squad members. He was though successfully used as an impact substitute off the bench scoring a number of tries from here. 2004/05 Season The 2004/05 season started well for Wallace, playing from out-half he hit the winning drop goal in the 17‚Äì16 defeat of Edinburgh at Murrayfield but after this the Ulster team and himself both suffered a massive dip in form. After the home defeat to Leinster in September 2004 he was relegated to the bench to accommodate David Humphreys at out-half. He made a number of appearances off the bench in this period but having come on for David Humphreys in the away Heineken Cup defeat to Gloucester he damaged knee ligaments that would see the him ruled out until the new year. With the Autumn Internationals directly after the Gloucester game and Humphreys involved with Ireland, Wallace would have had a chance to get a run of games for Ulster in the no.10 shirt if it were not for this unfortunate injury. As it where he would make his return to the Ulster bench in the 9‚Äì8 away defeat to Leinster at Donnybrook, Dublin. Having then come on as a replacement in the 14‚Äì12 home win over Gloucester he started the following game, away to Cardiff Blues, at fullback. His next appearance in an Ulster shirt would be in the home glamour friendly against the touring South African team the Bulls. Having come on at out-half for Adam Larkin he put in a decent showing reminding the Ulster management of what he was capable of. The Ireland A team had a one-off fixture with France A at Donnybrook, Dublin with Wallace, playing out-half and kicking 12 points in the 15‚Äì9 triumph, putting in an accomplished display. He subsequently regained the position of back-up out-half to David Humphreys and started in the 21‚Äì15 away defeat to Munster. Injury to Humphreys towards the end of the season gave Wallace two further starts in Celtic League games against Cardiff Blues and Llanelli Scarlets. He was selected by Ireland to tour Japan over the summer where he would have won his first full cap but his injury jinx struck again and a broken hand ruled him out. 2005/06 Season He began the 2005/06 season as Ulster's back up out-half and an injury to Bryn Cunningham meant Wallace played the opening 4 games of Ulster's Celtic League campaign from fullback putting in some solid performances including an important kicking display in the 22‚Äì19 away victory over the Dragons. Once Cunningham returned Wallace was once again relegated to the bench as cover for Humphreys. Having sat on the bench for a number of games he finally got another start at home to the Ospreys whilst Humphreys was on Ireland duty. Wallace played poorly that night and his lack of game time was apparent. After discussions with Ulster coach Mark McCall it was decided it would be better for Wallace to go and play for his club, Ballymena, and get 80 minutes week in, week out. His next appearance in an Ulster shirt that season was not even in the white of the senior team but the black shirts of the Ulster A team in the 24‚Äì19 defeat to Leinster A where Wallace played Inside Centre. He would continue to play for Ballymena before being once again drafted into the Ulster 22 for the Heineken Cup fixture away to Treviso where he came off the bench to score a try in the 43‚Äì26 bonus point win. After this cameo performance he would go on to sit on the bench for Ireland A in the 20‚Äì12 away defeat to France A, where he came on, and the 33‚Äì18 victory over England A at Kingsholm. He would then once again return to his club for regular rugby as well as turning out for the Ulster A team in the 24‚Äì22 away defeat to Leinster A in Dundalk. When the club season ended though he was drafted back into the Ulster squad for the home game against the Borders. Having come on early for the injured Johnny Bell he put in a great performance at inside centre where he scored a well worked try. He retained his place in the starting line-up for the following week's trip to Stradey Park to face the Llanelli Scarlets and put in another solid performance in the no.12 shirt in the 12‚Äì12 draw. He would go on to keep his place in the team for the famous 19‚Äì17 victory over the Ospreys at the Liberty Stadium which took place the following week where Ulster clinched the Celtic League crown with a last minute drop goal from David Humphreys. Churchill Cup 2006 Over the summer he played in the United States and Canada in the Barclays Churchill Cup with the Ireland A team playing at out-half in all three of Ireland's games, the wins over USA and England Saxons and the defeat to the New Zealand MƒÅori. His performances were rewarded with very positive reviews and it seemed his confidence was finally returning. 2006/07 Season He began the 2006/07 season partnering Paul Steinmetz in the centre and as since kept his place even keeping Ireland star Andrew Trimble on the wing. The first two months of that season saw Wallace play the best rugby of his career and finally seem to fulfil some of the early promise which first shown back in 2001. It therefore came as no surprise that Wallace was called up to the Ireland Autumn International Squad and won his first cap when coming on as a replacement in Ireland's record 32‚Äì15 victory over South Africa. He did not get on in Ireland's second game, a 21‚Äì6 victory over Australia, but did start and indeed star in the 61‚Äì17 thrashing of the Pacific Islanders, in what was the last ever international at Lansdowne Road. Wallace scored 26 points, including a try, 6 conversions and 3 penalties. Following that display, Wallace secured himself a place in the 6 Nations squad and won one cap during the campaign, coming off the bench in the historic 43‚Äì13 defeat of England at Croke Park. Wallace continued to play for Ulster in the remaining Celtic League games however the Ulster team went through an end of season dip in form which saw them finish a disappointing 5th. Wallace did however, towards the end of the campaign, get some game time at out-half as opposed to in the centre. Argentina Tour 2007 Wallace was named in the Ireland Squad for the 2007 tour to Argentina and played in the first test, a 22‚Äì20 defeat to a last minute Felipe Contepomi drop goal. Wallace had a good game however had to retire during the 2nd half after sustaining a knee injury. The loss of Wallace was undoubtedly crucial in Ireland losing the game. The knee injury kept him out of the 2nd test. Rugby World Cup 2007 Wallace was named in Eddie O'Sullivan's 50 man training squad in preparation for the forthcoming World Cup to be held in France. Wallace made his fifth test appearance in Ireland's World Cup Warm-Up test against Scotland at Murrayfield. Wallace started a match in which Ireland were beaten 31‚Äì21 by an impressive Scotland performance in what was a tight game with late try by Andy Henderson finally defeating Ireland. The next day Wallace was duly named in Ireland's squad for the World Cup. Outside of Irish legend Ronan O'Gara Wallace was the only recognised Out-Half in the Irish squad, something which drew much criticism upon coach Eddie O'Sullivan. Wallace also came on as a substitute in the non-cap warm-up game with French Top 14 side Bayonne; a match that as subsequently been dubbed the \\"Battle of Bayonne\\" due to the extremely physical nature of the game which included Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll leaving the field with a broken sinus. Wallace was named on the bench for the historic international at Ravenhill between Ireland and Italy however he was unused. 2007 to 2009 The 2007/08 season turned out to be both extremely disappointing for both Ireland and Ulster. With Ulster, Wallace played the majority of the first half of the season in the number 10 shirt however with the arrival of new coach Matt Williams after Christmas, Wallace cemented his place in the team in the number 12 shirt with the young Niall O'Connor taking over at out-half. It was certainly a season to forget, with Ulster finishing bottom of their Heineken Cup group behind Gloucester, Bourgoin and the Ospreys. They also finished 9th in the Magners League. Internationally, Ireland did not fare much better with a 4th-placed finish in the 6 Nations which would ultimately seal the fate of coach Eddie O'Sullivan. This was Ireland's lowest ever finish in the 6 Nations and was compounded by an embarrassing home loss to a rejuvenated Wales. Wallace gained brief substitute appearances against Scotland and England to gain his 7th and 8th international caps respectively. Wallace was named in the Ireland squad for their summer tour games against the Barbarians, New Zealand and Australia. In the Barbarians game Wallace started at out-half and gave an accomplished display in Ireland's 39‚Äì14 win. Having previously been named on the bench for the test against New Zealand in Wellington the withdrawal of Leinster's Luke Fitzgerald gave Wallace a start in number 12 jersey. He did not disappoint scoring Ireland's only try in a brave 21‚Äì11 loss which heralded a return to what Ireland had always been capable of but had been repressed in the last 12 months of O'Sullivan's tenure. Wallace also played in the following weekend's encounter with the Wallabies with Ireland losing the game 18‚Äì12. Following on from his fine form in the 2007/08 season, he began the 2008/09 season in equally good form for Ulster; playing most of his rugby once again as an Inside Centre. His club form was so good that, even with a fit-again Gordon D'Arcy, he was named as Ireland's starting number 12 for the 2009 Six Nations. Although he lost his starting berth for the final two matches of the campaign, he was a valuable member of the victorious Ireland team that won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam, their first Grand Slam in 61 years. There was massive relief for Wallace after Stephen Jones missed a late penalty awarded when Wallace clumsily strayed offside at a ruck. His shirt that he wore (12) was made up of tiny signatures of Irish fans the first being his son. 2011/12 Season Wallace was chosen for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and played two games but missed the 2012 Six Nations Championship through injury. He played 9 times for Ulster Rugby in the league scoring 3 tries. References External links * Profile, irishrugby.ie (archived via web.archive.org); accessed 8 February 2018.

The zoo developed from Exmoor Bird Gardens, opened on the site of a farm in 1982. The current owners took over in 1993, and have enlarged and developed the zoo, now specialising in the conservation of smaller animals. The zoo has been a member of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums, since 1995 and recently became a member of EAZA (European Association of Zoos and Aquariums) in 2018. History Exmoor Bird Gardens opened on the site of a farm in 1982, expanding to in 1985. Financial difficulties led to a change of ownership in 1993, and the new (and still current) owners started refurbishing the run-down bird gardens, also adding a number of animal species to the attractions. The 1995 name change to Exmoor Animal & Bird Gardens coincided with the joining of BIAZA. A further name change, to \\"Exmoor Zoological Park\\", took place in 1997, although this has since been shortened to just \\"Exmoor Zoo\\". Since then the zoo has expanded and developed further, and the focus has started shifting towards exhibiting larger animals than previously. Animal overview Exmoor Zoo cares for 175 species of animals, birds and reptiles. Many extremely rare captive species are exhibited such as singing dogs, fanaloka, rusty spotted cats and yellow throated martens. =Mammals= Otters at Exmoor Zoo Among the larger residents are cheetahs, maned wolves, tapirs and bat-eared foxes. The zoo is home to one of the largest collections of ibis and also includes howler monkeys, gibbons and a significant number of species of smaller carnivores. One of the zoo's feature attractions, the new enclosure for the \\"Exmoor Beast\\", was completed in January 2007 when Ebony arrived. She is a melanistic ('dark-coloured' or 'black') leopard thought to be one of only two in the British Isles available for breeding. The zoo received a male black leopard as a potential mate for Ebony in December 2009. Zoysa came from Linton Zoo, Cambridgeshire, on breeding loan. Other mammals include reindeer, lemurs, porcupines, and meerkats. =Birds= There is a large lake, home to pelicans, waterfowl and terrapins. Aviaries hold birds such as South American parrots, storks, ibis and great grey owls. Conservation work The zoo participates in international, European and national animal breeding programmes, and cooperates with other zoos around the world to exchange animals to ensure their survival. The zoo was noted for its conservation work with tamarins and marmosets but more recently long-nosed potoroo & smaller carnivores. In the news Thieves targeted the zoo in March 2006, stealing a number of endangered species. The entire colony of eleven black-tufted marmosets were stolen, the only breeding colony in Britain, wrecking 13 years of the zoo's attempts to protect the highly endangered animals. The thieves' haul also included a pair of white-fronted marmosets, a pair of cockatoos and a pair of amazon parrots. It is believed that the animals were stolen 'to order'. Two of the marmosets have since been recovered.BBC News story regarding Marmoset Theft In September 2006 the zoo acquired a pair of howler monkeys, called Greeb and Wing, to act as a 'burglar alarm'. This move was prompted by the theft of the marmosets earlier in the year. The zookeepers are hoping that the noisy monkeys will be enough to scare off intruders.CBBC Newsround story regarding the howler monkey 'burglar alarm' In June 2006 a family of blackbirds nested in an artificial tree in the education centre, drawing attention from families visiting the zoo.BBC News story regarding blackbirds in artificial tree -- accessed 2009-09-18 A pair of albino skunks were born at the zoo in 2012.BBC News - albino skunks - June 2006 -- accessed 2011-03-12 References External links * Category:Tourist attractions in Devon Category:Zoos in England Category:Buildings and structures in Devon Category:Zoos established in 1982 ","title":"Exmoor Zoo"},{"id":"7693279","text":"La moglie pi√π bella () is a 1970 Italian film directed by Damiano Damiani, based on the 1965 case of Franca Viola, who challenged the still frequent southern Italian custom of kidnapping and raping a prospective bride by refusing to marry her abductor.Flavia Brizio-Skov Popular Italian Cinema: Culture and Politics in a Postwar Society 2011 - Page 232 \\"Another important film discussing sexual violence against women is Damiano Damiani's The Most Beautiful Wife6 (1970), a socially committed\\" It was the debut film for the then 14-year-old Ornella Muti.Gian Piero Brunetta The History of Italian Cinema: A Guide to Italian Film from Its ... -- 2009 Page 229 \\"La moglie piu bella (The Most Beautiful Wife, 1969), Ornella Muti's debut; \\"Stephen Gundle Bellissima: Feminine Beauty and the Idea of Italy - 2007 - - Page 194 \\"As a result, she reflected the opportunities that women now had, as well as the discrimination they faced.

It was produced by Granada Television. The programme was presented by Jeremy Hawk from 1957 to 1962 and Barbara Kelly from 1963 to 1967. The series was based on an American show entitled Tic Tac Dough which ran from 1956 to 1959 and was revived in 1978. Additionally, a children's version of the show called Junior Criss Cross Quiz was produced starting in 1957 (the same year the adult version started). Kids played the game, but for prizes instead of money. This series ran from 13 November 1957 to 29 June 1967. Presenters on the children's version were: Jeremy Hawk, Chris Kelly, Bob Holness, Mike Sarne, Chris Howland, Gordon Luck, Peter Wheeler, Bill Grundy, Danny Blanchflower and Barbara Kelly. Format The game was basically the same as the American Tic Tac Dough with a similar set. Two contestants played the game with the champion playing cross (\\"X\\"), and the challenger playing noughts (\\"O\\"). They faced a noughts & crosses (tic-tac-toe) game board of nine subjects. Player took turns (starting with the champion) picking categories and answering questions in those categories. Correct answers placed his/her symbol in the board and added money to the pot; the centre box was worth ¬£40 while the outer boxes were worth ¬£20. Each cross or nought on the \\"Junior\\" edition scored 10 points with the center box being worth 20 points for the winner to redeem for prizes. The first player to get three in row (across, up and down, or diagonally) won the game and became champion. The first ever winner on the show was Bill Sykes of Sale who won ¬£460, and the highest amount won in the show's history was ¬£2,360. By 1960, each contestant could only win up to ¬£1,000.

However, it was possible to play on a monochrome monitor as long as the graphics card also supported color graphics (e.g. a Genoa Color Graphics Card).

Robinson married Susanna Philipse, heiress to a significant share of the roughly Highland Patent on the lower Hudson River in the Province of New York. With the onset of the American Revolutionary War, he sought to remain uninvolved, but in 1777 formed the Loyal American Regiment, which proved a very active Loyalist force in that conflict. In addition to serving as its commander through the British defeat 1783, Robinson is known for his work with the British secret service during the war, particularly in regards to the betrayal of Continental general Benedict Arnold in the Andr√© Affair. At the time of his betrayal, Arnold was using the confiscated Robinson home as his headquarters, with Continental Army commander-in-chief Washington a temporary occupant. It is there Andr√© was brought after his capture. Following Andr√©'s trial and sentencing British commanding general Sir Henry Clinton sent a delegation to Washington that included Robinson as a character witness for Andre, to plead for the Major's life. It is said Washington refused to see or be swayed by his old friend. During the war, the Philipse Patent lands were confiscated by the Revolutionary government of New York. Following the war the Robinsons retired to Britain with some of their family. In spite of a provision in the 1783 Treaty of Paris advocating restitution for their losses, no compensation was ever paid the Robinson family by the United States. Much later they were awarded a settlement of approximately 25% of their combined family property's ¬£80,000 original value by the British Compensation Commission, ultimately receiving less than 20% in payment. Early life Robinson was born in Middlesex County in the Colony of Virginia on 11 January 1721. He was a son of the Hon. John Robinson, a President of its House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, and Catherine (n√©e Beverley) Robinson, daughter of Robert Beverley, Esq., of Beverley, Yorkshire. His parents were, in property and family, among the leading families in the province. His grand-uncle, Dr. John Robinson, Bishop of London, had gone to America as secretary to government.Gentleman's Magazine (February 1852) pp. 188‚Äì190. Reportedly, Robinson was a childhood friend of fellow Virginian, George Washington. Career Map of the Philipse Patent showing the holdings of Philip Philipse, Mary Philipse, and Robinson's wife Susanna Philipse In 1745, he raised in Virginia an independent company and relocated it to New York to defend that state's frontier against Indian attack. In 1752, his wife, her elder brother Philip, and younger sister Mary, each inherited a one-third share of what then became known at the \\"Philipse Patent\\", effectively today's Putnam County, New York. Upon his wife's inheritance, the now wealthy couple settled on a parcel of her land at the foot of Sugarloaf Hill in the Hudson Highlands where they built a family home they called Beverley. George Washington was for a time an irregular guest, developing an attraction to Susanna's younger sister Mary. The Patent itself was only lightly settled by tenant farmers and lacked the commerce and industry of the Manor which had been inherited by her eldest brother. =American Revolution= Col. Beverley Robinson's house in the Hudson Highlands, occupied by Arnold as his headquarters With the onset of the American Revolutionary War Robinson sought to remain uninvolved and, reportedly, \\"desired to remain in the quiet enjoyment of country life and management of his large domain. He was opposed to the measures of the British Ministry, gave up the use of imported merchandise, and clothed himself and his family in fabrics of domestic manufacture.\\" Nevertheless, he entered the military service of the Crown. Due to his standing entitled him to high rank, and upon raising the \\"Loyal American Regiment\\" in 1777, principally in New York, he was commissioned its Colonel. He also commanded the corps of Guides and Pioneers, which included black Loyalist soldiers from the Black Company of Pioneers. His sons figured prominently in the selection of officers for the Loyal American Regiment, with Beverley serving as Lieutenant-Colonel and Frederick an ensign. The regiment, which saw much fighting in the course of the war, figured most prominently in the attack on the Hudson River's Fort Montgomery, on 6 October 1777, when British and Loyalist forces overwhelmed the Colonials in the Battle of Fort Montgomery. Robinson was also heavily involved in the treason of Benedict Arnold, and it is generally believed that he was acquainted with the traitor's purpose before it was known to Sir Henry Clinton, or any other person. And it appears certain that Arnold addressed him a letter on the subject of going over to the Royal side, before soliciting the command of West Point. As the plot matured, he accompanied Major John Andr√©, Adjutant General of the British Army in America and head of British Secret Service, to Dobb's Ferry to meet Arnold, according to a previous arrangement; but an accident prevented an interview, and both returned to New York. Subsequently, he went up the Hudson River in , for the purpose of furthering the objects in view; but failed in his most material designs. Arnold now sent Smith on board Vulture with a letter, which was delivered to Colonel Robinson, and on the faith of which Andr√© went on shore. The treacherous Whig had been expected on the ship in person, and it has been said that Robinson was much opposed to Andr√©'s trusting himself to the honour \\"of a man who was seeking to betray his country.\\" But the zealous young officer would not listen to the prudent counsel, and determined to embark upon the duty from which he never returned. On 23 September 1780, Andr√© was captured and on 26 September was conveyed a prisoner to Colonel Robinson's own house, which, with the lands adjacent, had been confiscated by the state, which Arnold had occupied as his headquarters, and of which Washington was then a temporary occupant. After Andr√©'s trial and conviction, Clinton sent three commissioners to the Whig camp, in the hope of producing a change in the determination of Washington, and of showing Andr√©'s innocence; to this mission Robinson was attached in the character of a witness. He had previously addressed the Commander-in-Chief on the subject of Andr√©'s release; and, as he and Washington had been personal friends until political events had produced a separation, he took occasion to speak of their former acquaintance in his letter. On 6 September 1781, Robinson was not in command of the Loyal American Regiment that accompanied Benedict Arnold in the burning of New London, Connecticut. His son, Lieut. Colonel Beverly Robinson Jr. commanded it in his place.The Battle of Groton Heights, page 60-by William Wallace Harris, 1870 =Post-war life= In 1779, the inherited Philipse lands and property, including Susanna's share of the Philipse Patent, were forfeited and seized by provincial New York authorities.The Beginnings of Holy Trinity \\"Tory Beverly Robinson's lands were seized in 1779 by the commissioners of forfeiture and sold at auction in 1782 to one Joseph Roskrans.\\" The property was auctioned off in 1782 by the Commissioners of Forfeiture without compensation to the Robinsons,Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"'Article V of the peace treaty signed by Britain and the United States in Paris on September 3, 1783, insists on 'the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to real British subjects\\" and to noncombatant loyalists.

Ultimately the British Compensation Commission granted them ¬£24,000 toward the original ¬£80,000 value of his and Susanna's personal estate (reflecting about ¬£16,000 Sterling, plus the 60,000 Philipse Patent acres and some city property valued together at about ¬£64,000), though only about ¬£17,000 was ever paid.Life of Sir John Beverley Robinson, Bart., C.B., D.C.L.: Chief-Justice of Upper Canada, by Major General Charles Walker Robinson, C.B. (1904), as cited at Loyal American Regiment, Beverley Personal life St Mary's Church, Thornbury On 7 July 1748, Robinson was married to Susanna Philipse (1727‚Äì1822) at Trinity Church, New York City. She was the eldest surviving daughter of Frederick Philipse II, second Lord of Philipsburg Manor, a very prosperous hereditary estate in lower Westchester County, and heiress to an interest in the Highland Patent, a roughly landed estate on the Hudson River spanning fully between the Hudson Highlands and the Connecticut Colony border. The Robinsons had ten children, three of whom died young. The surviving children included four boys and a girl: * Beverly Robinson, Jr. (1754‚Äì1816), who married Patty Hayt and Anna Dorothea Barclay. * Morris Robinson (1759‚Äì1815), who married Margaret Ann Waring. * Susanna Maria Robinson (1760‚Äì1833), who died unmarried.Find a Grave, Susanna Philipse Robinson * John Robinson (1761‚Äì1828), who married Elizabeth Ludlow (1768‚Äì1826), a daughter of George Duncan Ludlow, a fellow loyalist who served as the 1st Chief Justice of New Brunswick. * Frederick Philipse Robinson (1763‚Äì1852), who married Grace Boles, daughter of Thomas Boles, Esq., of Charleville, in the early 1790s. After her death in 1806, he married Ann Fernyhough, of Stafford, in 1811 who later died at Tobago. * William Henry Robinson (1766‚Äì1836), who was sent to England at the beginning of the Revolution. He served as the Commissary General of British North America during the War of 1812. Like many loyalists who moved to England, Robinson reportedly felt out of place and unappreciated. He resided at Thornbury, near Bristol in Southwest England, and died there on 9 April 1792, at the age of seventy. He was buried at St Mary the Virgin Parish Churchyard in Thornbury. =Descendants= Through his son John, who settled in Saint John, New Brunswick after the war, he was a grandfather of five boys and two girls.

Early life Pierre de Br√©z√© was born circa 1410. Career de Br√©z√© had made his name in the English wars when in 1433 he joined with Yolande, queen of Sicily, the constable Richmond and others, in chasing from power Charles VII's minister La Tr√©moille. He was knighted by Charles of Anjou in 1434, and presently entered the royal council. In 1437 he became seneschal of Anjou, and in 1440 of Poitou. During the Praguerie he rendered great service to the royal cause against the dauphin Louis and the revolted nobles, a service which was remembered against him after Louis's accession to the throne. de Br√©z√© fought against the English in Normandy in 1440‚Äì1441, and in Guienne in 1442. He was granted the defunct title of comte d'√âvreux in 1441 for his role in the strategic maneuvers during the siege of Pontoise led by Charles VII that finally defeated the English in the Ile de France. In the next year he became chamberlain to Charles VII, and gained the chief power in the state through the influence of Agn√®s Sorel, superseding his early allies Richmond and Charles of Anjou. The six years (1444‚Äì1450) of his ascendancy were the most prosperous period of the reign of Charles VII. His most dangerous opponent was the dauphin Louis, who in 1448 brought against him accusations which led to a formal trial resulting in a complete exoneration of Br√©z√© and his restoration to favour. He fought in Normandy in 1450‚Äì1451, and became seneschal of the province after the death of Agnes Sorel and the consequent decline of his influence at court. He made an ineffective descent on the English coast at Sandwich in 1457, and was preparing an expedition in favour of Margaret of Anjou when the accession of Louis XI brought him disgrace and a short imprisonment. In 1462, however, his son Jacques married Louis's half-sister, Charlotte de Valois, daughter of Agn√®s Sorel. In 1462 he accompanied Margaret to Scotland with a force of 2000 men, and after the Battle of Hexham he brought her back to Flanders. On his return he was reconciled with Louis XI and reappointed seneschal of Normandy. He inherited the Ch√¢teau du Bec-Crespin from his brother-in-law, Antoine Crespin, in 1454. Death and legacy de Br√©z√© died in the Battle of Montlh√©ry on 16 July 1465. He was succeeded as seneschal of Normandy by his eldest son Jacques (c. 1440‚Äì1490), Count of Maulevrier. The best contemporary account of Pierre de Br√©z√© is given in the Chroniques of the Burgundian chronicler, Georges Chastellain, who had been his secretary. Chastellain addressed a D√©pr√©cation to Louis XI on his behalf at the time of his disgrace.

Turning northeast, SR 18 travels to Greenville in central Meriwether County, and is concurrent with US 27/SR 1 from their intersection south of Greenville into downtown Greenville, where SR 18 turns southeast, is concurrent with SR 109, and travels to Woodbury. Turning east and crossing into Pike County, the route again turns northeast and travels through Molena, where its concurrency with SR 109 ends, into Concord, where it curves east and travels to Zebulon. Curving once again to the southeast, SR 18 crosses into Lamar County and travels to and around Barnesville, where it begins a concurrency with US 41/SR 7, before heading into Forsyth in Monroe County, ending its concurrency with US 41, and where it crosses I-75 shortly after leaving Forsyth. The highway continues east into Jones County and enters Gray, where it is briefly concurrent with US 129, SR 11, and SR 22, and where it turns southeast once more in the direction of Gordon in Wilkinson County. In Gordon, the highway turns south and southeast, crosses into Twiggs County, and reaches its eastern terminus in Jeffersonville. History =1920s to 1940s= SR 18 was established at least as early as 1919 on its current path, from Greenville to Barnesville. By the end of September 1921, it was extended south-southeast on a concurrency with SR 41 to Harris, then on a sole path southwest to SR 1 in Chipley. Between October 1926 and October 1929, the Chipley‚ÄìHarris segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the middle of 1930, the Harris‚ÄìGreenville segment also had a completed hard surface. In February 1932, SR 18 was established on a segment from Forsyth to Gray. However, there was no indication if they were connected via a concurrency with US 41/SR 19. In September, a portion east of Greenville had a completed hard surface. In May 1933, the entire Greenville‚ÄìWoodbury segment was completed. In February 1934, SR 18 was extended westward to West Point. Just over two years later, a portion west of Zebulon was completed. Between September 1938 and July 1939, the path of SR 19 from Barnesville to just southeast of Forsyth was truncated to the latter point. SR 18 was designated on this segment instead. It was also extended southeast from Gray to SR 57 south of Gordon. The segment from Barnesville to southeast of Forsyth, a portion south-southeast of Gray; and the portion south of Gordon all had a completed hard surface. In 1942, two segments had a completed hard surface: a portion west of Chipley and from Woodbury to the approximate location of Molena. Two years later, SR 18 was extended south-southwest to Jeffersonville. Between the beginning of 1945 and November 1946, the entire Woodbury‚ÄìZebulon segment was hard surfaced. By February 1948, two segments were also hard surfaced: the West Point‚ÄìChipley segment and from Gray to south-southwest of Gordon. =1950s to 2000s= Between April 1949 and August 1950, US 27 Alt. was designated on the Harris City‚ÄìGreensville segment. Two segments were hard surfaced: the Zebulon‚ÄìBarnesville segment and the western part of the Monroe County portion of the Forsyth‚ÄìGray segment. By the beginning of 1952, the entire eastern part of this last segment (except for the eastern end) was hard surfaced. In 1953, the extreme eastern end of this segment was also hard surfaced. Between June 1954 and June 1955, the portion of SR 18 from south of Gordon to Jeffersonville was hard surfaced. By July 1957, a portion west-southwest of Gray was also hard surfaced. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the Junes County portion of the Forsyth‚ÄìGray segment was hard surfaced. By the beginning of 1966, the southern part of a south-southwest bypass of Barnesville was proposed from SR 18 in Aldora to an unnumbered road south of Barnesville. In 1967, the bypass was built as part of US 341/SR 7. In 1986, the path of SR 18 was rerouted in Barnesville: it traveled north on US 341/SR 7, then south- southeast on US 41, before resuming its previous path. In 1993, part of a southern bypass of Gray, designated as SR 932, was proposed from US 129/SR 11/SR 18/SR 22 in the southwest part of the city to SR 18 in the southeastern part of it. Five years later, the path of SR 18 in Griffin was shifted southward, replacing the proposed path of SR 932. In 2007, the path of US 41/SR 18 in the Barnesville area was shifted southward, truncating the path of US 341/SR 7 to the current northern terminus. Major intersections Special route =Gordon spur route= State Route 18 Spur (SR 18 Spur) was a spur route of SR 18 that existed completely within the city limits of Gordon. Between June 1963 and the beginning of 1966, it was established from SR 18 to SR 243. In 2012, this spur route was decommissioned.

With the help of a rectifier it converts AC supply into DC. Its function is to supply a stable voltage (or less often current), to a circuit or device that must be operated within certain power supply limits. The output from the regulated power supply may be alternating or unidirectional, but is nearly always DC (Direct Current). The type of stabilization used may be restricted to ensuring that the output remains within certain limits under various load conditions, or it may also include compensation for variations in its own supply source. The latter is much more common today. Applications current (left) and voltage (right) * D.C. variable bench supply (a bench power supply usually refers to a power supply capable of supplying a variety of output voltages useful for BE (bench testing) electronic circuits, possibly with continuous variation of the output voltage, or just some preset voltages; a laboratory (lab) power supply normally implies an accurate bench power supply, while a balanced or tracking power supply refers to twin supplies for use when a circuit requires both positive and negative supply rails). * Mobile Phone power adaptors * Regulated power supplies in appliances * Various amplifiers and oscillators Topology & Technology Many topologies have been used since the regulated supply was invented. Early technologies included iron-hydrogen resistors, resonant transformers, nonlinear resistors, loading resistors, neon stabiliser tubes, vibrating contact regulators etc. Modern regulated supplies mostly use a transformer, silicon diode bridge rectifier, reservoir capacitor and voltage regulator IC. There are variations on this theme, such as supplies with multiple voltage lines, variable regulators, power control lines, discrete circuits and so on. Switched mode regulator supplies also include an inductor. At times regulated supplies can be much more complex. An example supply from a 1980s TV which used bidirectional interaction between the main supply and the line output stage to operate, generating a range of output voltages with varying amounts of stabilisation. Since neither stage could start without the other running, the supply also included a kickstart system to pulse the system into operation. The supply also monitored voltages in the TV power circuitry, shutting down if these voltages went out of spec. For special applications, supplies can become even more complex.

It publishes two periodicals: the monthly newspaper Neue Internationale and the theoretical organ Revolution√§rer Marxismus. The origins of the group lie in the Spartacusbund, which existed until 1982. One faction in that organization had contacts to the British group Workers' Power so Arbeitermacht was founded. These two groups along with the French Pouvoir Ouvrier and the Irish Workers' Group founded the Movement for a Revolutionary Communist International. Soon they found supporters in Austria, Peru, and Bolivia, so the movement renamed itself to League for a Revolutionary Communist International, and after adopting a new program in 2003 it got its present name, League for the Fifth International (LFI). In 2014 Workers' Power was becoming a leading fraction of the newly funded confraternity of Trotskyist groups in Germany, the New Anticapitalist Organisation (Neue Antikapitalistische Organisation) which was dissolved subsequently in 2016.http://nao-prozess.de/ueber-uns/http://www.islinke.de/nao_bilanz.htm In 2017, it changed its name to ArbeiterInnenmacht (see Binnen-I). The LFI found an independent youth organization called REVOLUTION, which stands in political solidarity with the LFI. After extended disputes about the role of a communist youth organization, the inner structures, the question of building the workers party and the resulting relation to the LFI, a minority of Revo, who refer to themselves as \\"independents\\", formed a tendency called iRevo in the summer of 2006. IRevo, which included a large part of the German section, were expelled in October 2006.

However, researchers did not begin to use the new facilities until well into the fall 2004 semester. Early in 2001, Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann of Butler, Pennsylvania and Bohlin Cywinski Jackson of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were chosen by Rensselaer as the architecture firms to handle the design of the structurehttp://news.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=483&setappvar;=page Kurp, Patrick. ‚ÄúArchitects Chosen to Design New Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies Building‚Ä¶‚Äù 23 Feb. 2001. 14 Oct 2006. Board chairman of Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann Associates, Richard Rittelmann who obtained an architecture degree from RPI in 1960, was chosen to lead the project. Rittelmann was chosen for the project as his firm was a national leader in the design of research and biotechnology buildings. During the project, twelve students participated in a two credit course called ‚ÄúTracking the Biotechnology Center,‚Äù a course designed for civil engineering and architecture students. Mark Mistur, an associate professor of architecture, along with Rittelmann designed the course thinking it ‚Äúwould be a wonderful opportunity for students to see the whole process, including the struggles and successes that result when architects and engineers work together.‚Äùhttp://www.rpi.edu/dept/NewsComm/Magazine/fall03/feature2-1.html Knight, Margaret M. ‚ÄúMaster Builder.‚Äù Fall 2003. 14 Oct 2006. The course brought students through the entire process of constructing a building. Topics of the course included everything from the physical construction and design processes of the building to the legal issues associated with such a large project. The Biotechnology Center is from what appears to be, from the inside, two separate L-shaped buildings. The first of these ‚Äúbuildings‚Äù is a group of offices with one three story wing facing 15th Street and another four story wing facing College Ave. The second ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù is a four story section of laboratories that run adjacent to the Center for Industrial Innovation. A large glass atrium separates the two sections. Elevated walkways allow researchers to pass from their offices across the atrium to their laboratories. This is done because laboratory space is very expensive to build and has strict code requirements. Separating the spaces allows for a more cost effective design. Along with cost effectiveness, the building was also designed with energy efficiency in mind. The large atrium, which gives light to much of the building, requires no heating in the winter, and no cooling in the summer. Natural ventilation is obtained through a series of soffit vents. Laboratories include heat recovery systems to trap heat and incorporate the most energy efficient lighting In an effort to blend the new facility with its historical surroundings, the 15th Street fa√ßade was designed to match the red brick construction of the Quadrangle residence hall. On the South face of the building a more contemporary style is used, as there are fewer building styles for it to clash with. This side of the building showcases the glass atrium and includes a large open grass area with walkways, benches, and outdoor lighting. Building features and facilities  View of east fa√ßade At 218,000 square feet (20,250 m¬≤), the Biotechnology Center is the 3rd largest building on RPI‚Äôs campus. It contains office space for 400 researchers and over 71,500 square feet (6,600 m¬≤) of laboratory space. To encourage collaboration among researchers, the Biotechnology Center also features 5,830 square feet (540 m¬≤) of seminar space and 5,200 square feet (480 m¬≤) of auditorium and gallery space. Part of this space includes the Bruggeman Conference Center, a 150-seat wired auditorium located on the southwest corner of the building The Biotechnology Center contains three different types of laboratory spaces to complement each other. The three types are Research, Support and Core Laboratories. Research Laboratories are designed to be flexible. These laboratories were designed in a way so they could be used for almost any type of research activities. Support Laboratories are less flexible than the Research Laboratories but contain special equipment such as a mass spectrometer.

Biography Charles Albright was born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1852 and commenced practice in Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania. Moving to the Territory of Kansas in 1854, Albright participated in its early development; though he returned to Pennsylvania and resumed the practice of law in Mauch Chunk in 1856. He was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1860 and 1872. During the American Civil War, Albright served in the Union Army as major of the 132nd Pennsylvania Infantry. Honorably mustered out with his regiment and the rank of colonel on May 24, 1863; he was recommissioned as colonel of the Thirty-fourth Pennsylvania Militia during the Gettysburg Campaign on July 3, 1863, and honorably mustered out again on August 10, 1863. About a year later, on September 4, 1864; he was recommissioned as colonel of the 202nd Pennsylvania Infantry. On March 7, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Albright to the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from March 7, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 10, 1865.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 739 Albright was honorably mustered out August 3, 1865. After the war, he resumed the practice of law in Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania. Albright was elected as a Republican to the Forty- third Congress. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1874. He resumed the practice of law and also engaged in manufacturing in Mauch Chunk until his death there in 1880. Notes References Retrieved on 2008-02-14 *Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J.

Glasses Direct While studying for his final university examinations, Murray Wells discovered that he needed to start wearing spectacles. Surprised by the high price quoted by an optician, he contacted first manufacturers and then individual workers until a technician told him that a pair of glasses selling for ¬£150 costs only ¬£7 to make. Inspired by this, he created a website selling spectacles directly to the public, initially funding his business using the remains of his student loan, he joined the small existing group of online spectacles retailers in the UK's traditionally highly controlled, arguably oligopolist spectacles market. (See the article UK Opticians (retailers) for a discussion of industry structure.) In its first year of business, Murray Wells' new company Glasses Direct sold 22,000 pairs of glasses, and had an annual turnover of ¬£1m. In 2009 Glasses Direct had 70 employees and sold a pair of glasses every three minutes. When the business was sold, revenue was expected to break ¬£35m in sales in 2014. Industry pressure Several established chains of conventional bricks and mortar opticians attempted to close down Glasses Direct with legal and regulatory threats. Murray-Wells published their lawyers' letters on his website, where they remained until the embarrassed lawyers used copyright to force their removal. Murray Wells then replaced the letters with a note explaining why they were no longer there. Murray-Wells also sent out men dressed as sheep to Newcastle city centre to hand leaflets explaining how much cheaper his products were than those of high street opticians, suggesting that spectacle wearers were being \\"fleeced\\".

The red equator is a square whose corners are the only four points on the map at which the projection fails to be conformal. The Peirce quincuncial projection with Tissot's indicatrix of deformation. The Peirce quincuncial projectionA Quincuncial Projection of the Sphere by Charles Sanders Peirce. 1890. I. Frischauf. Bemerkungen zu C. S. Peirce Quincuncial Projection. (Tr., Comments on C. S. Peirce Quincuncial Projection.) A Treatise on Projections by Thomas Craig. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1882. p 132 Science, Volume 11. Moses King, 1900. p 186 is a conformal map projection developed by Charles Sanders Peirce in 1879. The projection has the distinctive property that it can be tiled ad infinitum on the plane, with edge-crossings being completely smooth except for four singular points per tile. The projection has seen use in digital photography for portraying 360¬∞ views. The description quincuncial refers to the arrangement of four quadrants of the globe around the center hemisphere in an overall square pattern. Typically the projection is oriented such that the north pole lies at the center. History The maturation of complex analysis led to general techniques for conformal mapping, where points of a flat surface are handled as numbers on the complex plane. While working at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce published his projection in 1879 (Peirce 1879),(Lee, 1976) gives 1877 as the year in which the projection was conceived, citing \\"US Coast Survey Report for the Year Ending with June 1877\\", 191-192. having been inspired by H. A. Schwarz's 1869 conformal transformation of a circle onto a polygon of n sides (known as the Schwarz‚ÄìChristoffel mapping). In the normal aspect, Peirce's projection presents the Northern Hemisphere in a square; the Southern Hemisphere is split into four isosceles triangles symmetrically surrounding the first one, akin to star-like projections. In effect, the whole map is a square, inspiring Peirce to call his projection quincuncial, after the arrangement of five items in a quincunx. After Peirce presented his projection, two other cartographers developed similar projections of the hemisphere (or the whole sphere, after a suitable rearrangement) on a square: Guyou in 1887 and Adams in 1925. The three projections are transversal versions of each other (see related projections below). Formal description The Peirce quincuncial projection is \\"formed by transforming the stereographic projection with a pole at infinity, by means of an elliptic function\\". The Peirce quincuncial is really a projection of the hemisphere, but its tessellation properties (see below) permit its use for the entire sphere. The projection maps the interior of a circle onto the interior of a square by means of the Schwarz‚ÄìChristoffel mapping, as follows: : \\\\operatorname{sd} \\\\left(\\\\sqrt 2 w , 1/\\\\sqrt 2\\\\right) = \\\\sqrt 2 r where sd is the ratio of two Jacobi elliptic functions: sn/dn; w is the mapped point on the plane as a complex number (w = x + iy); and r is the stereographic projection with a scale of 1/2 at the center. An elliptic integral of the first kind can be used to solve for w. The comma notation used for sd(u,k) means that 1/ is the modulus for the elliptic function ratio, as opposed to the parameter [which would be written sd(um)] or the amplitude [which would be written sd(u\\\\Œ±)]. The mapping has a scale factor of 1/2 at the center, like the generating stereographic projection. Properties According to Peirce, his projection has the following properties (Peirce, 1879): * The sphere is presented in a square. * The part where the exaggeration of scale amounts to double that at the centre is only 9% of the area of the sphere, against 13% for the Mercator projection and 50% for the stereographic projection. * The curvature of lines representing great circles is, in every case, very slight, over the greater part of their length. * It is conformal everywhere except at the four corners of the inner hemisphere (thus the midpoints of edges of the projection), where the equator and four meridians change direction abruptly (the equator is represented by a square). These are singularities where differentiability fails. * It can be tessellated in all directions. Tiled Peirce quincuncial maps Tessellated version of the Peirce quincuncial map The projection tessellates the plane; i.e., repeated copies can completely cover (tile) an arbitrary area, each copy's features exactly matching those of its neighbors. (See the example to the right). Furthermore, the four triangles of the second hemisphere of Peirce quincuncial projection can be rearranged as another square that is placed next to the square that corresponds to the first hemisphere, resulting in a rectangle with aspect ratio of 2:1; this arrangement is equivalent to the transverse aspect of the Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection. Known uses Using the Peirce quincuncial projection to present a spherical panorama. Like many other projections based upon complex numbers, the Peirce quincuncial has been rarely used for geographic purposes. One of the few recorded cases is in 1946, when it was used by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey world map of air routes. It has been used recently to present spherical panoramas for practical as well as aesthetic purposes, where it can present the entire sphere with most areas being recognizable. Related projections In transverse aspect, one hemisphere becomes the Adams hemisphere-in-a-square projection (the pole is placed at the corner of the square). Its four singularities are at the North Pole, the South Pole, on the equator at 25¬∞W, and on the equator at 155¬∞E, in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans, and in Antarctica. Carlos A. Furuti. Map Projections:Conformal Projections. That great circle divides the traditional Western and Eastern hemispheres. In oblique aspect (45 degrees) of one hemisphere becomes the Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection (the pole is placed in the middle of the edge of the square). Its four singularities are at 45 degrees north and south latitude on the great circle composed of the 20¬∞W meridian and the 160¬∞E meridians, in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. That great circle divides the traditional western and eastern hemispheres. See also * List of map projections References Further reading * Peirce, C. S. (1877/1879), \\"Appendix No. 15.

This list includes main characters, recurring characters and important guest characters. The main characters typically function as a team, defending the planet from alien and nefarious human threats. The series operated with a \\"monster of the week\\" format for its first two series before adopting a serial-based format for its third and fourth series, which feature an extended recurring cast of supporting characters. Main characters =Jack Harkness= John Barrowman plays protagonist Jack Harkness Jack Harkness, played by Scottish-American actor John Barrowman, is the leader of Torchwood Three. A former Time Agent born in the 51st century, Jack had two years of his memories wiped by the Time Agency and subsequently became a con man operating in the 20th century, where he stole the name of \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\"; his real name is unknown. After meeting the Ninth Doctor in Doctor Who, Jack reformed and changed his ways, and after a stint as the Doctor's time travelling companion found his way to Torchwood in the 19th century. Cursed with immortality following his previous adventure with the Doctor, Jack served Torchwood on-and-off for centuries, eventually becoming its leader at the start of the 21st century, and handpicking a new team for himself thereafter. As a result of his immortality, Jack has lived a long life, in which he has seen the loss of his brother Gray, his grandson Stephen, and numerous lovers, both male and female. =Gwen Cooper= Eve Myles plays leading lady Gwen Cooper Gwen Cooper, played by Welsh actress Eve Myles, was recruited into Torchwood Three in the series premiere \\"Everything Changes\\". A policewoman, partnered with PC Andy Davidson, Gwen by the second series becomes elevated to the team's second-in-command in her own mind, after taking control as leader during Jack's absence. Despite their relationship being tested by Gwen's dishonesty, feelings for Jack Harkness and a tempestuous affair with Owen Harper, Gwen and her live-in boyfriend Rhys eventually get married. Gwen is one of two surviving agents following the destruction of the Cardiff branch of the Torchwood Institute, and goes into hiding following the birth of daughter Anwen. During Miracle Day she is conflicted between her Torchwood duties and her responsibility to her baby daughter and severely ill father. Her family has lived in Wales for generations, and it is suggested by the Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) that Gwen is related to the Gwyneth (also portrayed by Eve Myles) whom they met in Cardiff in 1869 in \\"The Unquiet Dead\\", due to spatial genetic multiplicity. =Owen Harper= Doctor Owen Harper, played by American-born English actor Burn Gorman, is Torchwood Three's medical officer. After he loses his fianc√©e to an alien parasite, Owen's genius and determination are recognised by Captain Jack and he is recruited into the Institute. Owen has many short-lived sexual relationships with women such as Suzie Costello and Gwen Cooper but remains largely indifferent to the affections of colleague Toshiko Sato. In Torchwood series 2, Owen is killed by Aaron Copley, and having been resurrected with alien technology is left in a state of living death; cheating death proves short-lived, as Owen is seemingly vaporised in a surge of radiation in the series 2 finale, \\"Exit Wounds\\". Naoko Mori plays tech expert Toshiko Sato =Toshiko Sato= Toshiko Sato, played by Japanese-born British actress Naoko Mori, is Torchwood Three's technical expert and computer specialist. The character first appeared in the Doctor Who episode \\"Aliens of London\\", although this experience was not mentioned in Torchwood until her final appearance in the episode \\"Exit Wounds\\", where it was revealed that she was covering for team medic Owen. Toshiko is quiet, fiercely private and professional. A fantastic genius, she was recruited into Torchwood after being imprisoned by a similar organization, UNIT, from whom she stole design plans for a \\"sonic modulator\\" in a bid to free her captured mother. Working for Torchwood Three, Toshiko perfected the \\"Rift Manipulator\\" device for the organization. Throughout the series, Toshiko is seen to harbor feelings for Owen Harper; she confesses the extent of her feelings on her death-bed as Owen laments never managing to take her on the date he promised her. =Ianto Jones= Gareth David-Lloyd plays general factotum Ianto Jones Ianto Jones, played by Welsh actor Gareth David-Lloyd, is Torchwood Three's support man. His job initially involves managing clean-up operations concerning Torchwood's various activities and providing tea and coffee, although his role later expands to accompanying the team on field missions. Having transferred to Torchwood Three from the head branch in London (Torchwood One), Ianto at first has the main motivation of simply housing his partially cyber-converted girlfriend Lisa Hallett, who later breaks loose and is exterminated by the team in \\"Cyberwoman\\". He enters into a sexual relationship with Jack in the first series, which meets with mixed reactions from the other characters; Owen, for example, characterises him as Jack's \\"part time shag\\". Ianto never received full security in his relationship with Jack or with his sexuality; shortly after he became secure with their being labelled a \\"couple\\", he was killed by a virus in episode four of the 2009 serial Children of Earth. Kai Owen plays Gwen's partner, Rhys Williams =Rhys Williams= Rhys Alun Williams, portrayed by Welsh actor Kai Owen, is a recurring character in the first two series and a main cast member from the third series onwards. Rhys is initially introduced as Gwen's oblivious live-in boyfriend, but as the series progresses he becomes aware of the existence of extraterrestrial life, and the true nature of Gwen's job. The two marry in the episode \\"Something Borrowed\\" and proclaim a relationship based on truth. When the government attempt to assassinate Gwen Cooper in Children of Earth, Rhys goes on the run with the team, assisting his wife in lieu of a fourth team member following the deaths of Tosh and Owen. Though he would rather live a domestic life with Gwen and their daughter Anwen in the fourth series, Rhys again finds himself having to assist Torchwood‚Äîwhich is no longer an official government agency, but rather a band of fugitives‚Äîover the course of the fourth series. Mekhi Phifer plays CIA agent Rex Matheson =Rex Matheson= Rex Matheson, played by American actor Mekhi Phifer, is a field agent for the CIA whose investigation into Torchwood leads him to join the organisation after he is betrayed by the CIA. Rex is immediately connected to the supernatural event which is preventing humans from dying; he survives a fatal wound to the heart in the first episode of Miracle Day. Well-trained within the CIA, Rex finds himself frustrated by Jack and Gwen's ad hoc and sometimes unprofessional approach to field work, and also by Esther's lack of experience. He befriends and romances Vera Juarez, and is appalled at what happens to her. As the series progresses, Rex softens to his teammates, particularly Esther who he is unwilling to sacrifice at the expense of the world. After the Miracle ends, Rex is horrified to discover he seems to be Immortal in the same vein as Captain Jack. Alexa Havins plays CIA analyst Esther Drummond =Esther Drummond= Esther Drummond, played by American actress Alexa Havins, is an analyst working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) alongside Rex Matheson, whose lifestyle as a field agent she romantically envies. After her investigation into Torchwood leads to her betrayal by the CIA, she joins Torchwood. Though a rookie in the field, she provides the team with a competent computer analyst and hacker as they investigate the so-called miracle which has prevented death from occurring to human beings on Earth. As the series progresses, Esther also takes part in the team's undercover operations and at one point spends two months on the run with Jack Harkness in Scotland. She is eventually fatally shot in Buenos Aires as a measure to persuade Rex not to reverse the Miracle. =Oswald Danes= Oswald Danes, played by American actor Bill Pullman, is a former schoolteacher; in 2006, he was convicted and sentenced to death in Kentucky for raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl named Susie Cabina. His only defense for the crime was that \\"she should've run faster\\". He is executed by lethal injection in a Kentucky penitentiary; though the execution is carried out, Danes does not die thanks to Miracle Day. As a convicted murderer and child rapist, Danes is vilified by the public, but opinions begin to change when he tearfully expresses remorse for his crimes in a television interview. After she offers him protection and exposure Danes accepts an offer of representation from Jilly Kitzinger and enjoys a brief media career. Danes ultimately kills himself with a bomb at the climax of Miracle Day. Supporting characters introduced by series =Series one (2006‚Äì07)= Suzie Costello Suzie Costello, portrayed by Indira Varma, is a principal character in the first episode \\"Everything Changes\\". The second-in- command of Torchwood Three, the Cardiff-based wing of the Torchwood Institute, she has been researching a piece of alien technology, a glove which has the ability to resurrect creatures that have recently died, but only for a short period of time. It is revealed later in the episode that she has been murdering people in order to create test subjects for the Glove, having become obsessed with trying to make it work permanently. While confessing her crimes to Gwen Cooper, she prepares to shoot Gwen in order to cover up her crimes, when Jack arrives. Suzie shoots Jack in the head, but he rises again due to his inability to die, and she commits suicide by placing the muzzle beneath her chin and shooting herself instead. In \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\", the Torchwood team brings her back to life using the Resurrection Gauntlet (wielded by Gwen) and the \\"Life Knife\\". Unknown to the team, this was part of a plan that Suzie set up months before her death. She appears to be resurrected permanently and unable to be killed. However, this is because the gauntlet is continuing to transfer life energy between her and Gwen. Suzie feels inferior to and resents Gwen for \\"replacing\\" her in all areas, including having a relationship with Owen Harper. When asked what she experienced while dead, she initially claims that she remembers nothing but darkness, but later tells Jack that she sensed something in the darkness that is coming for him. Suzie manipulates Gwen into freeing her from the base and subsequently murders her own father. Expressing regret over Gwen's impending death but still willing to sacrifice her to remain alive, Suzie continues draining Gwen's life energy and remains alive even after Jack shoots her multiple times, until Toshiko Sato destroys the gauntlet, breaking the energy transfer and finally killing Suzie once more. Jack tells Ianto Jones to record the multiple causes of death as \\"Death by Torchwood\\". Suzie has a leading role in the novel Long Time Dead, a prequel to Torchwood: Miracle Day. Andy Davidson Andy Davidson, played by Tom Price, is Gwen Cooper's former police partner, an officer for the South Wales Police in Cardiff. Price is credited as a guest star in all four series. PC Andy first appears in Torchwoods premi√®re episode, \\"Everything Changes\\" and reappears on a semi-regular basis. Andy had a crush on Gwen when the two worked together and still has feelings for her. Whilst he never quite understands the function of the Torchwood Institute, he appreciates that Gwen's work for Torchwood involves \\"spooky\\", extraterrestrial situations, and therefore comes to trust them. When his loyalties are put to the test in Children of Earth he sides with Gwen rather than follow government procedure. In Miracle Day, Andy is now a sergeant and one of few people to have Gwen's contact details while she is in hiding. He is later forced to assist the CIA with her rendition to the United States by Rex Matherson. Lisa Hallett Lisa Hallett, played by Caroline Chikezie, is introduced in \\"Cyberwoman\\" as a former employee of Torchwood One in London and ex- girlfriend of Ianto Jones. It is established that during the \\"Battle of Canary Wharf\\" the Cybermen needed more troops and began directly converting people rather than transplanting their brains into Cyberman shells. Lisa is in the midst of conversion when Ianto rescues her, taking her and a support system to Torchwood Three where he keeps her in a basement until he can restore her humanity. Once freed from the unit, her Cyberman persona asserts itself and she attempts to take over the Hub in order to use it as a base for a new Cyber army. Seeing how far Ianto has gone to protect her, she transplants her brain into the body of a pizza delivery girl so they can be together. Still claiming they could both be upgraded, her new body is shot and killed by the rest of the Torchwood team. What appeared to be Lisa's spirit reappears in \\"End of Days\\", urging Ianto to open the Rift. Cannibal villagers Evan, Helen and nephew Huw Sherman, portrayed by Owen Teale, Maxine Evans, and Rhys ap Trefor respectively, are residents from a village with a very strange tradition in the episode \\"Countrycide\\". Once every ten years the villagers cannibalise any travellers passing by, through, or to their village. The Torchwood team travelled to the vicinity of the village in order to investigate disappearances in the area, thinking they could be connected to the Rift; when they were drawn into a trap orchestrated by the villagers, they discovered their unsettling secret. When the apparent ringleader of the group, Evan, was eventually captured and questioned, the only reason he gave for following this tradition was that \\"it made me happy.\\" Mary Mary portrayed by Daniela Denby-Ashe is featured in Greeks Bearing Gifts as a 19th- century prostitute. After fleeing from one of her potential johns, a soldier, Mary encountered an alien (later to be discovered as an Arcateenian) in the woods. The alien took over Mary's body and used it to live through the remainder of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Arcateenian later used Mary's preserved body to seduce Toshiko Sato. Diane Holmes Diane Holmes, played by Louise Delamere, first appears in \\"Out of Time\\". She is a pilot and early feminist from 1953 who becomes stranded in 2007 due to the Cardiff Rift. She enters a relationship with Owen, and he falls in love with her. After staying with Owen for a short time, and admitting her own love for him, she says farewell to a distraught Owen. Diane flies off in her plane, feeling the Rift will open again for her and take her somewhere new. Diane is seen in flashback clips in \\"Combat\\", \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\", and \\"A Day in the Death\\". She reappears briefly to Owen as a vision created by Bilis in \\"End of Days\\" insisting he do whatever he can to save her; the encounter leaves him in tears. Eugene Jones Eugene Jones, played by Paul Chequer, appears in the Torchwood episode \\"Random Shoes\\". When he was younger, his science teacher gave him an alien eye. As he got older, he started to get interested in aliens, approaching Torchwood a number of times. They paid no attention at all to him. He was described as a loser, a failure, a geek and an ordinary guy. In the present, he is killed in a hit-and-run accident. When he discovers that he is still \\"hanging around\\" he stays with the team, particularly Gwen, as they investigate his life. Reminiscing on his past, Eugene recalls how, one day, he tried to sell the eye on eBay. The bidding flew up to ¬£15,005.50, but two of his mates had actually set it up, making it go higher just to cheer him up; the previous bid was only ¬£5.50 lower, and Eugene was convinced that the alien had been trying to get his eye back. When the eye is removed from his body, he briefly becomes solid and saves Gwen from an oncoming car, before disappearing in a bright light. Captain Jack Harkness Group Captain Jack Harkness, RAF, played by Matt Rippy, appears in the episode \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\". When Torchwood's Jack Harkness and Toshiko Sato fall back in time to 1941, they meet him and discover him to be the real Captain Jack Harkness, whose name the con-man known as Jack appropriated. Captain Harkness is a young American serving as a Group Captain in a RAF Eagle Squadron, stationed in Cardiff. He is in a heterosexual relationship, but is revealed to be attracted to Torchwood's Jack. During his time with Jack and Tosh, he is shown to be a compassionate man, backing up Jack's story of Tosh working as a decoder for the government to protect her from the current anti-Japanese prejudice and bonding with Jack over their mutual grief over the responsibility of having to witness those they care for die while they survive. He is distressed at the idea that the woman he is dating while stationed in Cardiff is in love with him, unhappy to lead her on. After some indecision, and after Torchwood's Jack hints that he would soon die, he eventually strikes up the courage to dance with Torchwood's Jack in front of a party of servicemen and their guests. Before Torchwood's Jack leaves to return to the present, the two kiss passionately. The next day, Captain Jack Harkness dies fighting German fighters. In the present day, Toshiko Sato comforts Torchwood's Jack by telling him that 1941's Captain Jack would be proud that he had taken his name, carrying it on as he saves the world. Bilis Manger Bilis Manger, played by Murray Melvin, is a main antagonist of the first series. He has the ability to walk through time and teleport at will, In \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\", he appears as the manager of a 1941 dance hall, and in the present day remains its caretaker, ostensibly co-operating with Gwen when she visits the now derelict venue searching for Jack and Toshiko. However, he sabotages Toshiko's plans back in 1941 to send the full second half of the equations needed to bring back her and Jack more safely, by scratching away the last part of the equation. He took photographs, though, to ensure that the team would locate them in the past and have to open the rift to rescue them. In \\"End of Days\\", he reappears, first as an apparition to Gwen, then, in his shop, A Stitch in Time, where he reveals that he is able to travel between eras at will. He then infiltrates the Torchwood base, stabbing Rhys Williams, spurring Gwen to once more open the rift to save everyone's lives, however, this full opening unwittingly releases Abaddon. Moments later, Manger is found outside by the members of the team, telling them that his plan all along was to release Abaddon, who had been \\"chained under the rift\\", before vanishing again. The character returns in the spin-off novel The Twilight Streets by Gary Russell, apparently sponsoring the advertisement of a newly developed area of Cardiff. During this encounter, it is revealed that not only is he on the staff of Torchwood despite lacking any employee information - his hand print is granted full access in all Torchwood bases, but there is no record of his employment or specific role in the Institute - but also that his actions in releasing Abaddon were fundamentally benevolent, as Abaddon was required to stop sentient particles known as 'the Dark' that would corrupt the Torchwood team and drive them to turn against Jack to find a way of using the Rift to gain access to advanced technology. With the aid of the Torchwood team, Manger manages to defeat the Dark, and is last seen leaving on a train with a box that apparently contains Abaddon's ashes. =Series two (2008)= Captain John Hart Captain John Hart, played by James Marsters, first appears in the episode \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" as a rogue Time Agent and former partner of Jack Harkness, both professionally and sexually. He has been in rehab for drink, drugs, sex and murder. Captain John Hart appears through the Rift using a Vortex Manipulator in order to seek help from Jack. In \\"Exit Wounds\\", Captain John is revealed to have rescued Jack's brother Gray from his old captors, only to learn too late that Gray had been driven insane over the years. Beth Halloran Beth Halloran, played by Nikki Amuka-Bird, appears in \\"Sleeper\\". She is one of four alien sleeper agents in Cardiff belonging to Cell 114, but is totally unaware of this. She and three others were created and given human lives and memories to learn all they could about humans before her alien programming was activated, to commence their attack of Earth. After helping the team to track down the final agent, she pretends to intend on killing Gwen to provoke Torchwood into suicide by cop so that she does not one day experience the dehumanisation of having her alien consciousness awoken. Like all sleepers of her species, Beth's arm can transform into a blade-like weapon and can deploy explosive devices, in addition to this she possesses a tight-knit protective force field (which also projects false humanoid vitals) and superhuman strength. According to the Torchwood website, her body is stored in the cryogenics area. Tommy Brockless Tommy Brockless, portrayed by Anthony Lewis, appears in \\"To the Last Man\\". A combat stress reaction / shell-shocked World War I soldier, born in 1894, Tommy is brought into Torchwood Three's custody and cryopreserved in 1918 after his future self instructs them to do as such through a time slip. It is these time slips that Tommy is instrumental in stopping. At an unspecified year in his future, fragments of 1918 and the present will bleed together, potentially destroying the world. Hence, once every year, Torchwood awakens Tommy to check whether his presence is required and to give him a \\"day out.\\" It is 2008 when these events eventually begin to unfold. As this begins to happen, Tommy must be sent back to his own time acting as a metaphorical \\"stitch in time,\\" pulling all of 1918 back to where it belongs. However, during his last day, Tommy falls for Toshiko, making his decision all the more difficult. He is eventually convinced to do so thanks to Toshiko, who encourages him to fix the Rift by referring to him as her 'brave, handsome hero' (quoting Thomas's own words to her). She cannot reveal to Tommy that he will be one of hundreds of Shell shock victims executed for cowardice. Gerald & Harriet Gerald Carter (Roderic Culver) and Harriet Derbyshire (Siobhan Hewlett) appear in flashback sequences of \\"To the Last Man\\" investigating the case of Brockless in 1918. Trained in military intelligence, Carter would later become leader of Torchwood Three in Cardiff. Derbyshire was recruited directly from the University of Oxford (where she observed physics lectures) into Torchwood Three. It is noted in the episode that Harriet died at the age of 26. According to the Torchwood website, Carter had been an avid supporter of early \\"Rift theory\\", and after controversially being placed in charge of the team in 1907 managed to bring great strides. However, following the death of Harriet Derbyshire, Carter felt responsible and retired to a consultancy position, until his death in 1942. According to the website Harriet is one of the notable employees whose bodies are stored in the cryogenics area. Adam Smith \\"Adam Smith\\", an alien who feeds and survives off memories, appears in \\"Adam\\", played by Bryan Dick. Previously trapped in an extradimensional Void, Adam is drawn to the Torchwood team due to their unique memories and escapes the Void through the Rift. In less than 48 hours he is able to plant false memories in the team, posing as a member of Torchwood. It is this belief in him that allows him to survive. Accompanying the survival instinct, Adam shows a tendency to use his powers recreationally and maliciously. He provides a drastic role-reversal for both Toshiko, now a promiscuous extrovert who shares a passionate relationship with Adam, and Owen, now a shy geek with unrequited feelings for Toshiko. Adam also provides Jack with a resurgence of the repressed memories of the last pleasant memories of his family before his father's death and his brother's disappearance. As a side-effect of such new memory creation, other memories must be forced from the mind, leading Gwen to totally forget Rhys. When Ianto looks over his diary and discovers no reference to Adam, Adam attempts to escape by torturing Ianto with false memories of being a serial killer, only for Jack to see through the lie thanks to his knowledge of Ianto's personality. Although Adam tries to threaten Jack by altering his few happy memories of his childhood, Jack nevertheless deals with Adam's existence by giving everyone in the team 48-hour amnesia pills. Forgetting Adam causes his death and leaves the team puzzling the loss of the last 48 hours. Gray Gray, portrayed by Ethan Brooke as a child and by Lachlan Nieboer as an adult, is Captain Jack's younger brother and a main antagonist of the second series. Gray is first alluded to in the series two premiere \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\", when Jack's former partner John Hart states that he \\"found Gray\\". In \\"Adam\\", Jack's memories of his brother are brought to the surface by an alien who meddles with his memories. Jack recalls letting go of his brother's hand and losing him during an alien invasion in their homeland of the Boeshane Peninsula, an action he regards as the worst thing he ever did. Young Jack (Jack Montgomery) searches for Gray but is unable to find him. When the alien is defeated, he taunts Jack that he will lose these memories of his brother. In \\"Fragments\\", Captain John shows Jack a hologram of Gray. Appearing in \\"Exit Wounds\\", Gray is a damaged character who has endured a lifetime of torture; having learnt cruelty from his captors, Gray is a vengeful sadist. Gray returns to Jack only to reveal that he blames him for the torture he has endured over the course of his life. Seeking to punish his brother, Gray buries Jack alive in Cardiff in the year AD 27, placing him in a permanent cycle of death and resurrection. In present day, Gray wreaks havoc across Cardiff, and murders Torchwood member Toshiko Sato, who had been attempting to prevent a nuclear explosion which Gray had triggered. Jack, having been exhumed by Torchwood in the 19th century and subsequently placed into stasis, re-emerges and forgives Gray, and asks that his brother do the same. Gray refuses to absolve Jack, who sorrowfully chloroforms his younger brother. Jack places Gray inside a cryogenic chamber, knowing he may never awaken. Gray is probably killed in the explosion of Torchwood in series 3. Martha Jones Dr Martha Jones, played by Freema Agyeman, is a returning Doctor Who character who first appears on-screen in Torchwood in the episode \\"Reset\\". A former time-travelling companion of the Tenth Doctor, Martha helped him and Jack avert an apocalyptic future in the Doctor Who episodes \\"Utopia\\", \\"The Sound of Drums\\", and \\"Last of the Time Lords\\". In \\"Reset\\", it is revealed that Martha has become a Doctor of Medicine and a medical officer for the extraterrestrial response agency UNIT. After helping Torchwood solve a series of mysterious deaths around Cardiff, she becomes involved in assisting the team following the death and resurrection of Torchwood's medic Owen Harper in the episodes \\"Dead Man Walking\\" and \\"A Day in the Death\\". She collaborates with Jack, Gwen and Ianto again in the Doctor Who serial \\"The Stolen Earth\\"/\\"Journey's End\\" and the Torchwood radio play \\"Lost Souls\\". The creative team had originally intended for Martha to appear in series three,Torchwood: Children of Earth but Agyeman was unavailable. Aaron Copley Aaron Copley, portrayed by Alan Dale, is the leader of experimental medical facility \\"The Pharm\\" and features in \\"Reset\\". When his facility claims to have developed a miracle substance able to cure medically incurable diseases such as diabetes and cancer, the Torchwood team investigate. Martha Jones is sent in by Captain Jack, allowing Torchwood to gain access to Copley's files. It is discovered that he has captured alien specimens (including a giant mayfly and a weevil) and used their bodily fluids to develop the \\"Reset\\" cure. When Copley discovers that Martha knows this, and has herself actually travelled in time and space, he begins to carry out intrusive tests on her, believing that time travel may have altered her cells making her more likely to survive the treatment. After Martha is eventually saved by the team, and the Pharm's computer records are wiped and the aliens euthanased, Copley follows them outside and pulls a gun on her. Whilst trying to calm Copley down, Owen Harper is shot dead. In an act of revenge, Jack shoots Copley in the head, instantly killing him. Little Girl Skye Bennett plays a mysterious fortune teller who is a psychic, ageless tarot card reader, credited only as Little Girl. Outwardly a little girl, she is seen in both the 19th and 21st centuries as appearing roughly the same age. In her first appearance, \\"Dead Man Walking\\", she sends Jack to the disused St. Mary's parish church, the location of the second Resurrection Gauntlet, but promises it will bring further complications. Appearing for a second time in a 19th- century flashback, in the episode \\"Fragments\\", she approaches Jack to read his cards and tells him he will have to wait a century before meeting The Doctor once again. According to the TARDIS Datacore, the Little Girl may actually be Faith, a girl who lived and died in the 14th century and referenced in \\"Dead Man Walking.\\" Richard Briers' performance was praised by reviewers. Henry Parker Henry Parker, played by Richard Briers, is an elderly collector of alien artifacts in the episode \\"A Day in the Death\\". Following his wife's death he became intensely reclusive, guarding his house with hired security personnel. Torchwood describe him as \\"mostly harmless\\" and compare him to Howard Hughes. By 2008 Parker is dying from a failing heart, having suffered from three heart attacks, and a failed bypass. Terrified of death, he activated the Pulse, an artefact, taking it into his bed believing it to be a healing device. Because this device was giving off strange energy readings, Torchwood send in the technically deceased Owen Harper to bypass Parker's security and intervene. During a discussion with Harper, Parker revealed knowledge of the Torchwood Three team, and mentioned his own fear of death. Soon after Owen deactivated the pulse, Parker died of natural causes; Harper attempted artificial respiration to keep the man alive, but was unable to produce breath to do so. Digital Spys Ben Rawson-Jones praised Brier's \\"emotive portrayal\\" of Parker and found his death scene particularly moving. He also comments that his performance in this episode compensated for his \\"bizarrely over the top\\" performance in the Doctor Who serial Paradise Towers. Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair remarked that Parker's death \\"wonderfully pulled all the threads for the arc into one conclusive ending\\" whilst SFXs Richard Edwards felt that the character was \\"worthy of more screen time\\". Geraint Cooper Geraint Cooper, played by William Thomas, is Gwen's father, who first appears in \\"Something Borrowed\\". He is married to Gwen's mother Mary and lives in Swansea. Present at Gwen's wedding to Rhys he is alarmed to see her pregnant and more so when she tells him the true nature of her job. He attempts to phone the police when the shape shifting alien Nostrovite first attacks; but is prevented from doing so as Torchwood have jammed the phone lines. Despite Gwen and Rhys proclaiming that they will not keep secrets from each other in their marriage, Geraint's memories of the day are erased by Jack Harkness. Geraint subsequently forgets about the alien pregnancy, the wedding fiasco and the nature of Gwen's job; which his daughter feels to be \\"for the best\\". Between Children of Earth and Miracle Day Geraint becomes a grandfather to baby Anwen, and is properly told about Gwen's work for Torchwood. In \\"The New World\\", the first episode of Miracle Day, he is the victim of several heart attacks, yet does not die because of the \\"miracle\\" affecting the human population. Gwen returns from hiding to visit him in hospital and experiences conflicting emotions about his predicament. In \\"Escape to L.A.\\" Rhys unwittingly sends Geraint to a government run overflow camp that is under the control of PhiCorp. In \\"The Categories of Life\\", he and Gwen break into the camp to rescue Geraint, but their first attempt triggers another cardiac arrest, upgrading his government-appointed status from Category Two (conscious and living) to Category One (unconscious and due to be incinerated). Gwen and Rhys successfully rescue Geraint in \\"The Middle Men\\". Two months later, Gwen and Mary attempt to conceal Geraint from government officers in their basement, but he is recaptured in \\"The Gathering\\", and taken back to the overflow camp to be incinerated. In \\"The Blood Line\\", Gwen recounts a childhood memory of her father where he had received blame for money going from his work. Eager to help, Gwen had got together her pocket money but her father confided in her that what had bothered him was the fact that people thought him dishonest. Gwen remembered this as the first time anybody had spoken to her as an adult. Later, with aid from Andy, Rhys gains access to the overflow camp and sits at Geraint's side as the Miracle is finally negated, allowing Mary to say goodbye to her husband by telephone. Mary Cooper Mary Cooper, played by Sharon Morgan, is the mother of Gwen Cooper and is introduced in \\"Something Borrowed\\". Prior to her first appearance, Gwen‚Äôs mother was first referenced in \\"Ghost Machine\\" when Gwen relives a memory of Rhys and herself preparing to leave for Mary's sixtieth birthday party. In \\"Something Borrowed\\" Mary acts fastidious and difficult; she is persistent in nagging her husband Geraint and in scoring points against Rhys' Mum, Brenda. Like Geraint she is happy at the prospect of a grandchild from Gwen, because she believes the pregnancy will shock Brenda. Although Mary does not know the nature of Gwen's job she is caught up in the adventure when she is threatened by the Nostrovite; who has assumed Brenda's appearance. Despite Gwen and Rhys proclaiming they will not keep secrets from each other; Mary's memories‚Äîlike those of the other wedding guests‚Äîare erased by Jack Harkness. Mary forgets about the events of the wedding day, including her daughter's alien pregnancy, which Gwen feels to be \\"for the best\\". Mary was referenced in the Doctor Who story \\"The Stolen Earth\\"‚Äîin which Gwen instructs Rhys to tell her mother to \\"take her pills and go to sleep\\" during the Dalek invasion. In \\"The New World\\", the first episode of Torchwood: Miracle Day Mary accompanies her husband to hospital after he has a heart attack, and meets her granddaughter Anwen for the first time. With Gwen in hiding, Mary now knows the full workings of her daughter's former occupation and asks her for information about the miracle. When Gwen is renditioned to the United States, Rhys and Anwen move in with Mary and Geraint. After Geraint is taken to an overflow camp, Mary encourages Gwen's rescue mission. She is later kidnapped and held hostage in an attempt to force Gwen to hand in Jack Harkness. However, the family is rescued by a South Wales attack team, led by sergeant Andy Davidson, Gwen's ex-colleague. Mary‚Äôs life-threatening experience results in her telling Gwen not to give up, and to \\"go and get the bastards\\" responsible. In \\"The Gathering\\", set two months later, Mary is seen hiding her category one husband from the authorities. When the house is initially searched, Mary breaks down in tears after having been forced to pin down and stifle her husband to silence him. When the house is searched a second time, Mary is refused entry and reluctantly signs forms releasing her dead husband, who is taken back to the overflow camp in preparation for incineration. After Rhys gains an emergency police visa to visit the camp, and Gwen helps end the \\"Miracle\\", Mary gets a final chance to say goodbye to Geraint. Series writer Jane Espenson draws an analogy between the series four plot of Gwen and Mary hiding Geraint in the basement to the living situation described by Anne Frank in \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\". Although the eventual goodbye scene between Mary and Geraint did not feature heard dialogue, the content of her conversation was part of the initial script for the episode. Writing for the entertainment section of AOL's website Brad Trechak notes that he was highly amused by \\"the extremely British snark\\" exhibited by Mary in the episode \\"Something Borrowed\\". AfterElton's Steven Frank compares the character to \\"a tightly wound Helen Mirren\\" and also praises the \\"cattish behaviour\\" displayed in her interactions with Brenda. The Radio Times' Patrick Mulkern praised the storyline of the Cooper family in \\"The Gathering\\" describing the scenes with Mary and Gwen hiding Geraint in the cellar as \\"tense\\" and \\"touching\\". Nikki Bevan Ruth Jones played Nikki. Nikki Bevan, played by Ruth Jones, appears in Adrift as the single mother of a missing teenager, Jonah Bevan. During the police investigation she is befriended by Andy, who takes a personal interest in the case and refers Jonah's disappearance to Gwen Cooper. Unable to let her son go, Nikki spends her time obsessively looking through VHS tapes of crowd footage at major events trying to see her son. She sets up a self-help group called Searchlight for families of lost people in Cardiff, which alerts Gwen to the fact that the disappearances are widespread. Gwen eventually locates Jonah, aged and deformed in a secret hospital for those who had been taken by the rift and then returned. Nikki at first denies the fact that this man is Jonah but after he mentions childhood experiences the two have a heart-felt reunion. However, due to off-world torture Jonah is insane and spends twenty hours a day howling incessantly. Nikki is devastated that she cannot take her son home for a conventional relationship and blames Gwen, before giving up and throwing out Jonah's belongings. TV Squad's Jason Hughes praised the emotional scenes of Nikki being brought to see Jonah by Gwen and the \\"tragic emotional impact\\" of her telling Gwen to not do the same to any other families. He felt her role in the narrative worked as \\"an ambiguous moral about knowing versus not knowing\\" and praised the writer for not providing an easy answer. Alex Hopkins Alex Hopkins, portrayed by Julian Lewis Jones, is a former Torchwood Three leader, whose term ended on New Year's Eve, 1999 when he murdered his entire team and committed suicide. Before killing himself, he made freelance agent Jack Harkness the head of Torchwood Three, rewarding him for a century of loyal service. Having been shown an image of the future, Alex felt his team was grossly unprepared to deal with what was to come. His last words prophesied that the world was not ready for the changes the 21st century was to undergo. According to the Torchwood website, he is one of the notable employees whose bodies are stored in the cryogenics area, along with his entire team. The website also credits him in a letter with designing the Torchwood SUV; it had been his idea to have \\"TORCHWOOD\\" written across the side of it, despite concerns it would \\"compromise [Torchwood's] status as a clandestine quasi-governmental organisation.\\" Alice Guppy Alice Guppy, played by Amy Manson, was an employee of Torchwood Three during the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. She appears in flashback sequences in ‚ÄúFragments‚Äù and ‚ÄúExit Wounds‚Äù, in 1899 and 1901 respectively, both from Jack‚Äôs point of view. She holds the aggressive attitudes of Torchwood at the time, killing a Blowfish in cold blood in ‚ÄúFragments‚Äù, her moral justification being that it was ‚Äúa threat to the Empire‚Äù. In \\"Exit Wounds\\" she and fellow Torchwood employee Charles Gaskell (Cornelius Macarthy) discover Jack Harkness buried in Cardiff, and freeze him in the cryogenic area of the Hub. According to the Torchwood website, she is one of the notable employees whose bodies are stored in the cryogenics area. A diary extract on the website also expands on Guppy's backstory: recruited by later partner Emily Holroyd, she had been put in jail for attacking another woman in a laundry room. Holroyd explained that Guppy had been selected because \\"the skills [she] had demonstrated as a thief would be put to better use in espionage; not only [her] stealth, but [her] attitude towards violence.\\" =Children of Earth (2009)= Alice Carter Alice Carter (n√©e Melissa Moretti; previously Sangster), played by Lucy Cohu, is the daughter of Jack Harkness. Alice's birth name was Melissa Moretti, but she was placed under deep cover in 1977. Her precise history is unclear, but her mother died in 2006 and she is aware of her father's immortality, which she has not inherited. Her son, Steven Carter (Bear McCausland) is unaware that Jack is his grandfather, instead believing Jack to be his uncle. Although their relationship appears affectionate to a degree, Jack and Alice rarely have contact as Alice dislikes his work and the reminder that he will outlive her. When Jack attempts to use Steven for his Torchwood investigation, Alice refuses. After she and Steven are used as hostages to prevent Jack interfering, she convinces the black ops team holding her prisoner to break Jack out of prison to enlist his aid in defeating the 456. Jack uses Steven to kill the 456 by using him to transmit a resonance frequency that disrupts the wavelength-based 456. Jack knew that Steven would die but had no other option; Alice's relationship with her father completely disintegrates. Rhiannon Davies Rhiannon Davies, portrayed by Katy Wix, is the sister of Ianto Jones, who lives with her husband Johnny (Rhodri Lewis) and children Mica and David. Rhiannon and Ianto became distant after the death of their father, although Ianto visits her in an attempt to gain access to Mica so he can analyse the cause of the synchronised chanting affecting the world's children. Rhiannon refuses to let Mica go out of parental concern and sidetracks Ianto by taking an interest in his romantic relationship with Jack Harkness. Rhiannon's house is put under surveillance after the government attempt to assassinate the Torchwood team, although Rhiannon later sneaks out of her house and supplies Ianto with Johnny's car and a laptop so that he can rescue Captain Jack. Once the schools are closed on the third day of the crisis she starts looking after neighbourhood children, with husband Johnny charging \\"ten quid a kid\\". Ianto contacts her before facing the 456 and tells her that the government cannot be trusted. After Ianto dies, Rhiannon is visited in person by Gwen Cooper who explains Ianto's demise to her. Rhiannon is distraught but follows Ianto's final instructions and with the help of Gwen and Rhys takes the neighbourhood children on the run from the army. Mr. Dekker Mr. Dekker, played by Ian Gelder, appears as an engineer and head of Technology for MI5 who has researched transmissions from \\"the 456\\" since they were first received. In the first episode, he identifies with John Frobisher as \\"the cockroaches of government,\\" non-elected civil servants, who remain despite the fickleness of electoral tastes. When asked by Frobisher if he has any family, Dekker says he's always been too preoccupied with work. Dekker survives the gas attack in the Thames Building (which kills many members of MI5) by pulling on a biohazard suit in the nick of time, a success facilitated in part by the fact that he makes no attempt to save others. When his survival is pointed out by Colonel Oduya (Charles Abomeli), Dekker states that he managed it by simply standing back‚Äî\\"a strategy that's worked all my life.\\" He is abducted from his lab in the Thames Building by Agent Johnson's mutinying forces, along with Jack, and brought to a temporary HQ, where he halfheartedly assists Jack in assembling the transmission equipment necessary to combat the 456. He is shot in the leg by Agent Johnson in a presumed moment of frustration in response to his immediate pessimism about opposing the 456. Dekker shows greater willingness to assist actively with the project upon being reminded of the most recent and unprecedented transmission from the 456‚Äîthe squeal that killed Clement MacDonald, which Jack presumes can be played back against them. He and Jack realize simultaneously that the only way to transmit this will be through a child‚Äîkilling it in the process. Dekker, not aware that the only child available to them is Jack's own grandson, Steven, at first seems excited by this prospect‚Äî\\"Centre of the resonance‚Äîthat kid's gonna fry!\\" but looks disgusted upon witnessing the event. John Frobisher John Frobisher, played by Peter Capaldi, is introduced as Permanent Secretary to the Home Office and the civil servant placed in charge of the 456 incident. Frobisher has a wife, Anna and two school-aged daughters, Holly and Lily, who are subconsciously delivering the 456's message among the rest of the world's children. He is assisted by Bridget Spears and Lois Habiba. After telling Bridget about the 456, he hands her a file of a blank piece of paper. Spears knows what this means and types up the names of four people to be killed; the quartet had coordinated the surrender of twelve orphans to the 456 in the year 1965, and include Jack Harkness. His job becomes increasingly difficult when all around him, including Prime Minister Brian Green, begin to shirk any responsibility for the disaster that is unfolding. He is the representative chosen to meet with the 456 and negotiate their demands, which are revealed to be a share of the world's child population. Frobisher is ordered by the Prime Minister to publicly send his daughters off for inoculation (the cover for turning over children to the 456), to allow the government to appear just as much of a victim as the rest of the world and 'save face'. Leaving Number 10, he directs Bridget to sign for \\"Requisition 31\\" and bring it to him. The metal box contains a sidearm and a loaded magazine with which he kills his family, and himself‚Äîbelieving he is saving his daughters from the worse fate of being used as drugs by the 456. John Frobisher is not to be confused with Frobisher, a shape-shifting companion of the Sixth and Seventh Doctors in various spin- off media, who prefers the shape of a penguin. Peter Capaldi previously portrayed Lucius Caecilius Iucundus in the Doctor Who episode, \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\", and later played the Twelfth Doctor. The three characters are connected in that John Frobisher is a descendant of Lucius Caecilius Iucundas according to Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat, and the Twelfth Doctor subconsciously based his appearance on Lucius Caecilius IucundusStated in 'The Girl Who Died Bridget Spears Bridget Spears, played by Susan Brown, appears in Children of Earth and is the personal assistant to Home Office Permanent Secretary John Frobisher and immensely devoted to him - having worked together for thirty years. She gives Lois Habiba her username and password, so Lois can assist with the overwhelming number of people calling in, but Lois uses it to find out about the Torchwood Institute and Jack Harkness. After Frobisher tells Bridget about the 456, he hands her a file of a blank piece of paper. Bridget understands what this means and types up the names of four people to be killed, one of whom is the immortal Jack Harkness. Unbeknownst to Bridget, Lois sees this email and questions her own loyalties. After Frobisher's troubling meeting with the Prime Minister, Frobisher directs Bridget to sign for \\"Requisition 31\\" and bring it to him; the metal box contains a sidearm and a loaded magazine. At the same time, Bridget signs for the Torchwood contact lenses confiscated from Lois when the latter is arrested for working with Torchwood. Bridget pays Lois a visit in her police custody cell to tell her that John Frobisher was a good man and that this should be remembered in the aftermath of what is about to happen. Later, after the 456 are defeated and the Prime Minister is ready to blame the Americans for the whole incident, Bridget reveals that Lois had told her how the Torchwood contact lenses worked, and that she had recorded everything the Prime Minister had said. Disgusted by his assertion that they were lucky to have someone else to blame for the incident, Bridget informs the Prime Minister that she is ready to reveal his involvement to the public. It is implied that this will be used to force Green from office. Brian Green Brian Green, played by Nicholas Farrell, is the British Prime Minister in Children of Earth. It is not known if he followed Harold Saxon (i.e., The Master) directly, or if there was an interim between their respective governments. Using Home Office Permanent Secretary John Frobisher as a scapegoat, Green initially denies any previous British involvement with the 456 in 1965, to ensure plausible security. However, during negotiations, the 456 discloses that the reason it choose the UK to land was 'off the record', exposing to the Americans, et al., that the British Government are trying to hide the previous encounter in 1965 where 12 children were given to the 456 as a 'gift' in exchange for an antivirus to a current virulent strain. On Day Four. instead of counteracting the 456, Green employs his cabinet to decide how to select the 10% of children demanded by the 456. On Day Five, he informs John Frobisher that, for plausible deniability reasons, his children should be included in the 'gift' to the 456, which results in Mr Frobisher killing his family and himself to prevent the forced sacrifice of his children. After Captain Jack defeats the 456, Green still tries to protect his political ambitions, trying to blame American interference on government policy. However Bridget Spears, using the same Torchwood contact lenses used by Lois Habiba previously, threatens to expose the truth to the British public. Denise Riley, the Home Secretary, implies she is in a position to challenge Green's premiership following this. Lois Habiba Martha Jones in the third series Lois Habiba, played by Cush Jumbo, is a junior PA and assistant to Bridget Spears, who starts work at the Home Office, in John Frobisher's office, on the day the 456 make contact. Bridget Spears gives Lois her username and password, but out of curiosity Lois uses it to find out about the Torchwood Institute and Captain Jack Harkness after she receives a phone call from him. Spears types an email of the names of four people to be killed, one of which is Jack Harkness. Unbeknownst to her, Lois sees this email and starts to question her own loyalties. Lois decides to help Torchwood and after receiving a phone call from the fugitive Gwen Cooper, she decides to meet her. Although worried about committing treason on her second day, she gives Gwen and Rhys a way to access the prison facility where Jack is being held, and is pleased when Gwen offers her a job in the future. She also, after initially refusing, agrees to act as a spy for Torchwood, using contact lenses with integrated wireless cameras, as the seriousness of the situation has dawned on her. At this meeting she witnesses contact between Earth and the 456 and transcribes the 456's speech so Torchwood can cover the whole meeting. She is present when the 456 demand 10 percent of the Earth's children and at a later cabinet meeting where she witnesses self-interested views from the cabinet over the criteria of which children should be taken by the 456 following a failed attempt at negotiation. Working on Gwen's orders, she agrees to confront the cabinet by announcing that Torchwood have recordings of everything in order to force them not to comply with the demands of the 456. She was arrested in Day Five for espionage. From prison, she helps Bridget Spears use the Torchwood contact lenses to take down PM Brian Green's administration, and it is later said she will be released from prison. Lois' character was created by Russell T Davies to replace Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) when they could not get her for the third series. He describes her as \\"kind of a Martha figure\\", but one who lacks Martha's experiences and is \\"out of her depth.\\" Director Euros Lyn characterises Lois as an \\"everygirl\\" and a \\"reluctant hero\\" who is conflicted between helping Torchwood and obeying the government. Lyn also compared her role in the narrative to being similar to that of Rose Tyler and Gwen Cooper, used respectively as audience surrogates on Doctor Who and Torchwood. Johnson Johnson, portrayed by Liz May Brice, is the leader of a team of enforcers for the Government, assigned by John Frobisher to the job of dealing with Torchwood at the start of the 456 crisis. Ruthless and efficient, she has little time for social niceties and is determined to see her job done efficiently and successfully. After killing Jack by shooting him in the back, knowing he would resurrect, she uses a laser cutter to plant a bomb inside his stomach. She has no qualms about killing Dr Rupesh Patanjali, after refusing him a change of identity. Johnson detonates the bomb inside Jack, initiating the destruction of the Torchwood Hub. She later tracks down a fugitive Gwen; but Gwen shoots down her tyres and escapes. After Johnson's team uncovers several parts of Jack's severed body, she realises his body is still able to heal and detains him in a concrete-filled cell. After Gwen and Ianto break Jack out of his concrete cell she detains Alice and Steven Carter as insurance against Harkness going public with information on the 456. When the location of the regrouped Torchwood team is discovered by Johnson's team she moves in to confront them. However, when Gwen shows her recordings of government treachery, she backs down. In the final episode she questions her allegiance to the state in wake of its betrayal and at the prompting of Alice Carter, releases Jack Harkness from custody to fight the aliens. With the help of Johnson and Dekker, Jack is able to devise a way to defeat the 456, but it requires the sacrifice of his grandson. Despite her cold and callous nature, Johnson is genuinely horrified by Steven's brutal death. Clement MacDonald Clement MacDonald, played by Paul Copley and as a child by Gregory Ferguson, appears in Children of Earth. In 1965, Clement is one of the twelve children offered to the 456, but he is left behind and keeps a mental link to the 456 when they return forty years later. He has somehow acquired clairalience, a highly enhanced sense of smell, allowing him to detect the impending return of the 456 months before the events shown in the story, as well as other threats and also to determine that Gwen Cooper is pregnant and that Ianto Jones is \\"queer\\". After spending much of his life in care under the name Timothy White, traumatised and wracked with tics, Clement comes to Torchwood's attention when he is the only adult relaying the messages from the 456 in unison with the children. Escaping from the care home when the police arrives for him, he is initially arrested for causing an affray in his confused state, but is retrieved by Gwen Cooper. He then meets Jack Harkness, and recognises him as the man who escorted the twelve children to the 456 decades earlier. Clement is killed by the 456 when they transmit a resonance frequency that damages his brain; Harkness is later able to reverse this frequency and use it against the 456. Rupesh Patanjali Rupesh Patanjali, played by Rik Makarem, is a Cardiff doctor, originally from Chesterfield. He first encounters Jack Harkness and Ianto Jones when they arrive at the hospital to remove an alien hitchhiker from a recently deceased patient. His interest in Torchwood piqued, Rupesh makes his way to the Cardiff Hub. Gwen Cooper, noting a parallel between Torchwood's treatment of Rupesh and their initial treatment of her, promotes herself to recruitment officer and meets with Patanjali to discuss the possibility of a job. Patanjali's interest in the job is later revealed to be a facade. After luring Harkness back to St. Helen's hospital with a report of a strange death, he turns on him and shoots him in the back, \\"killing\\" him. It is revealed that Patanjali was working on the orders of Johnson who decided to plant a bomb in Harkness to wipe out the Torchwood operation. Johnson rebuked Patanjali when he expressed discomfort over Harkness' death by pointing out that he had killed a patient in order to facilitate the ruse which lured Harkness to her. After enquiring what was to become of him, Patanjali realises that Johnson plans to dispose of him. As he flees, he is shot in the back. In order to rescue Jack, Gwen and Rhys pose as undertakers seeking to reclaim Rupesh's body on behalf of his family. Denise Riley Denise Riley, played by Deborah Findlay, appears in Children of Earth and is the British home secretary. She first appears in Day Four, where she suggests handing over the lowest achieving 10% of children to The 456. Nobody disagrees with her choice, and so it goes ahead. When Jack Harkness, Johnson and Mr. Dekker killed the 456, she witnessed Brian Green say he was \\"lucky\\". Unbeknownst to Riley, Bridget Spears had continued Lois's work in recording the COBRA meetings. After this, she told Bridget that she was free to go, and that she will see to Lois's release. It is implied that she took over the position of Prime Minister. Johnny Davies Johnny Davies was the husband of Rhiannon and the father of David and Mica. He was devastated when Gwen Cooper told them that their children would be taken, so he led a rebellion on the street, and bought Rhiannon, Gwen and Rhys time to escape to a small dilapidated shack. He was glad when his children were not harmed, but was devastated by Ianto's death. =Miracle Day (2011)= Vera Juarez Dr Vera Juarez, played by Arlene Tur, is a divorced attending surgeon in Washington D.C. who appears between \\"The New World\\" and \\"The Categories of Life\\". Press materials promoted the character as \\"smart, fast talking and hard working\\" and underline that it is these characteristics which seconded her to being part of the government think-tanks. Through her job she is amongst the first to realise the repercussions of miracle day and she finds herself increasingly at odds with the inept medical system. After establishing a sexual relationship with Rex Matheson she allies herself with his Torchwood team. However, her first undercover investigation for the group is her last; she is burned alive after dissenting against Colin Maloney. Noah Vickers Noah Vickers, portrayed by Paul James, is a colleague of Esther Drummond who is charged with investigating the effects Miracle Day has had on the population. When Esther's discovery of the history of Torchwood is erased from her memory it is Noah's work in retrieving the last Torchwood file which triggers them. Esther misdirects him when she is attempting to escape the CIA headquarters where they both work. Noah later appears in \\"End of the Road\\" where he makes contact with Esther and Rex Matheson who have now been pardoned by the CIA following the ousting of several traitors. In \\"The Blood Line\\", Noah initiates a trace software package that can uncover the identity of the remaining mole within the CIA. However, just as Noah, along with Allen Shapiro, discovers Charlotte's duplicity, they are killed by a bomb left by her on their desk. Rex is later able to retrieve this information through a passcode derived from where he and Noah used to have donuts together. The pair of Noah and Charlotte has attracted comparisons to Rex and Esther. Writing for TV.com, Tim Surette describes Noah as \\"bizarro Rex\\" and Charlotte as \\"bizarro Esther\\". Charlotte Wills Charlotte Wills, portrayed by Marina Benedict, is a colleague of Esther Drummond. In \\"The New World\\" Wills acts uninterested in Torchwood and tells Esther that all enquiries have to go through Brian Friedkin. After Esther‚Äôs investigations render her a wanted woman she manages to escape the CIA compound by taking Charlotte‚Äôs identity card and assuming her identity. In \\"End of the Road\\" Wills returns and talks to Rex and Esther over video link, discussing developments with the Miracle. It is later revealed that she is working as a double agent, also having contact with a mysterious blue eyed man who represents The Families. In \\"The Gathering\\", Charlotte continues to act as a mole for the Families when Rex uncovers a lead; she tries to put him off researching a pulp short story apparently based on the Little Italy incident, and tells him that a DNA test that could find descendants of the author was unsuccessful. Later, she tracks Rex to Buenos Aires -- a location connected to the Blessing behind Miracle Day -- when he is on a secret mission for Torchwood, and contacts the Families. She detonates a bomb in CIA headquarters just as they discover that she is a mole; the explosion kills Shapiro and Noah. Despite her efforts to sabotage the mission, Torchwood end the Miracle. While attending Esther's funeral, Rex receives informations that reveals Charlotte is the mole. Charlotte turns and shoots Rex, and is in turn gunned down by Jack Harkness. In Miracle Day episode \\"The Gathering\\", Charlotte refers to a recent break-up with an ex- girlfriend. Writing for the lesbian blogging site AfterEllen, Heather Hogan describes this additional piece of characterisation as effective in reminding the audience that the Three Families are ordinary people, living alongside us. Anwen Williams Anwen Williams is the daughter of Gwen Cooper and Rhys Williams who makes her first television appearance in Torchwood: Miracle Day. Anwen is conceived three weeks prior to the events of Children of Earth. She spends her early months in hiding with them in the wilds of South Wales. She becomes part of a chase when assassins call on her parents‚Äô house, and Gwen is forced to fight with Anwen in her arms. In \\"Immortal Sins\\", Anwen is captured along with Rhys and Mary and used as leverage for Gwen to turn in Jack Harkness. However, the infant is later rescued by the intervention of a South Wales attack force, led by sergeant Andy Davidson. A scene in Gareth David Lloyd's Shrouded had previously depicted Gwen cradling an unnamed and ungendered baby in her arms, whilst the novel First Born, also set prior to Miracle Day, features a storyline where Anwen draws unwanted attention. The production team originally planned to call Gwen's daughter Emily, but changed to Anwen, as the name is more Welsh. Writer Jane Espenson feels that the infant's apparent \\"enthusiasm for action\\" works in that it \\"actually seems to speak to Gwen's own character\\". Jilly Kitzinger Jilly Kitzinger, played by Lauren Ambrose, is a high flying PR executive with few moral scruples introduced in \\"Rendition\\". Initially, she functions as a minor distraction and adversary to the Torchwood protagonists in her role as representative for the paedophile-murderer Oswald Danes and the mysterious drug company Phicorp. Towards the end of the series she affiliates herself with 'The Families', the main villains behind the supernatural event of 'Miracle Day' and her own position becomes clear. Whilst the character appears ruthless; promoted as having a 'heart of stone' portrayer Ambrose sees her character's ambition as showing strong personal qualities too. Though those she works for are defeated in the series finale, it is revealed that Jilly has survived, leaving the character's future uncertain. Lyn Peterfield Lachman portrayed the villainous Lyn Lyn Peterfield, portrayed by Dichen Lachman, is a CIA agent who serves as an antagonist to the Torchwood team in the episode \\"Rendition\\". It is revealed through exposition that she once had a sexual affair with Rex Matheson prior to the events of Miracle Day. Lyn is sent to help collect Jack and Gwen from Heathrow after they have been arrested by Matheson. Under the orders of Brian Friedkin, Peterfield attempts to assassinate the now mortal Jack Harkness by slipping arsenic into his cola. However, her plan is foiled when Jack identifies the poison and Gwen and Rex source an antidote. She is knocked unconscious by Gwen after insulting her capabilities and mistaking her for an Englishwoman. Once in the United States she attempts to defeat Rex in hand-to-hand combat once he realises the treachery of the CIA. However, he gains the upper hand and breaks her neck. Due to the effect of Miracle Day she is left still alive but with her head now on back to front. Lachman's casting as a CIA agent was reported alongside the casting of Havins as Esther in January 2011. Lachman had previously been suggested as a candidate to play Esther by End of Show writer Kevin Beaumont. Den of Geek's Simon Brew praised Lyn's villainous role, stating in his review of episode two that she was \\"the most menacing character we‚Äôve met in the show so far, [Oswald] Danes included\\", in addition to the special effects shot of her twisted neck. Conversely, SFXs Dave Golder felt the twist involving the character at the end of the episode suffered a \\"case of nobody quite knowing what level to play it at.\\" Brian Friedkin Brian Friedkin, played by Wayne Knight, is a high-ranking officer in the CIA and Esther and Rex's boss. After Miracle Day, Esther mentions that she has liaised with Rex over Torchwood's rendition to the United States. Upon learning that his agent Lyn Peterfield has a mortal Jack Harkness he orders Lyn to kill him, which she attempts to do by arsenic poisoning. He has been receiving messages from a mysterious unknown source represented by a triangle symbol for decades. Friedkin later arranges for Esther Drummond and Rex Matheson to be set up in his attempt to not only get rid of Torchwood, but anyone associated with the defunct organisation. The two escape, and Rex later confronts Friedkin at his Washington DC home. Rex takes Friedkins phone and is informed that whoever has been contacting Friedkin has been on Earth for decades. Rex later shoots next to Friedkin's head, warning him not to go deaf from the gunshot. Friedkin captures the Torchwood crew at the Colasanto estate but Rex secretly puts on Gwen's transmitter lenses and tricks Friedkin into confessing his work for the Families. Friedkin is arrested by his boss, Allen Shapiro. He blows himself up upon his capture, as The Families had ordered him to do, destroying himself, one of his agents and Olivia Colasanto. Brad Brad, played by Dillon Casey, is a Washington bartender. He appears in the episode \\"Dead of Night\\" when Jack Harkness visits the bar he works at. Brad takes pride in the amount of sobriety chips that have been cashed in subsequent to the miracle noting that people have turned to alcohol in response to worldwide immortality. When Jack offers a button to the collection, Brad is adamant that he does not damage his World War Two great-coat. The two men leave the bar with the intention of a one-night stand. Though Brad does not see the use in using protection because no-one can die, Jack calls him out on this noting that a sexually transmitted infection could still cause problems. He is later seen asleep next to Jack whilst Jack nurses a whisky and phones Gwen. One of the scenes between Jack and Brad was censored in the UK airing of the show, having been deemed too explicit for a prime-time audience. However, the sequence remained in its entirety in the Starz broadcast of the episode. Jane Espenson, who wrote the episode, commented that the sexual encounter between the two men was Jack's method of \\"affirming life\\". Sarah Drummond Sarah Drummond, portrayed by Candace Brown, is the sister of Esther Drummond. In the episode \\"Dead of Night\\", Esther states that whilst Sarah is older she has always had the task of looking after her because she can't cope. In \\"Escape to L.A.\\" Esther checks up on Sarah to see how she is coping in the aftermath of the Miracle. Sarah refuses to answer the door, which is barricaded with a number of different locks. Esther fears for Sarah's two young daughters, Melanie and Alice, as Sarah is hypochondriac and will not let them leave the house. It revealed that social services arrive and take Melanie and Alice into care, whilst Sarah undergoes psychiatric evaluation. In \\"End of the Road\\" Esther speaks to Sarah who is still located in the psychiatric ward under strict supervision from Doctors. She expresses the opinion that people in the new world no longer have souls, and appears eager to volunteer herself and her children to become category one‚Äîeffectively committing suicide. Her reaction to the state of affairs motivates Esther to do her utmost to put an end to the Miracle. Post Miracle, Sarah is seen alive and well with her children at Esther's memorial service. Ellis Hartley Monroe Ellis Hartley Monroe, portrayed by Mare Winningham, is a fictional American politician and Tea Party movement Republican who appears in the episode \\"Escape to L.A.\\" as a rival to Oswald Danes. Monroe is described by medical professional Vera Juarez as a small town mayor connected to the Tea Party who was \\"trying to make a name for herself\\". She does this by launching the controversial \\"Dead is Dead\\" movement, which believes that those who should have died during Miracle Day are no better than corpses. Her strong views and personality soon propel her to national attention. She momentarily eclipses Danes' public notoriety, stealing one of his engagements. In retaliation, Danes launches a publicity stunt at the hospital at which he was supposed to speak, which deflects attention from Monroe. She is later kidnapped by the forces behind Miracle Day, who inform her that they already have Danes and don't need her. She is trapped inside a crushed car and abandoned in a car lot, still alive within the wreckage of the car due to the effects of the Miracle. After her \\"death\\", a statement goes out on TV advising the public that Monroe will not be available to comment on the latest developments. The Cousin The Cousin, played by Chris Butler, is a high-ranking member of the Three Families and oversees the Buenos Aires Blessing site. In \\"Escape to L.A.\\" he speaks to Ellis Hartley Monroe over the phone as her car is crushed by a car compactor‚Äîwith her inside. He appears physically in \\"The Blood Line\\". When Rex Matheson and Esther Drummond reach the Buenos Aires site, they are captured by the Cousin's men, and he speaks to them and to Jack Harkness, Gwen Cooper, Oswald Danes, Jilly Kitzinger and the leader of the Shanghai site over the phone. When Jack and Rex prepare to sacrifice all their blood to end the Miracle, the Cousin shoots Esther, reminding Rex that if the Miracle ends, she will die. However Gwen convinces Rex to go ahead, and he and Jack end the Miracle. As both Blessing sites start to fall apart, Rex uses the last of his strength to throw the Cousin into the Blessing, and he falls to his death. Colin Maloney Colin Maloney, played by American actor Marc Vann, appears as in \\"The Categories of Life\\" and \\"The Middle Men\\" as manager of the San Pedro overflow camp in California. Maloney is encountered by agents Esther Drummond and Vera Juarez when they go undercover at the camp. Vera uses her medical panel credentials to pose as an inspector, though because of her race Maloney mistakes her for hired help. Despite Vera pointing out the harsh realities of the situation, Maloney appears to have no sympathy for the patients within the overflow camp, openly taunting a patient named George and excited for a visit from Hilary Duff rather than Hillary Clinton. After Vera realises the appalling, cramped and disease-ridden conditions the patients are in and instances of miscategorization on Maloney's watch, she threatens to prosecute him because of his negligence. Maloney defends himself on how he comes in under budget despite the fact he's meant to spend the money given to him and seems over his head dealing with the situation. After a heated argument, he takes a gun from a camp guard, Ralph Coltrane (Frederick Koehler), and shoots Vera twice . He covers up the shooting by masking it as the sound of a loud metal door clanging. Maloney disposes of Vera's body by burning her alive in one of the overflow camp modules, along with many category one patients who are still physically alive but legally dead. In \\"The Middle Men\\", Maloney, acting out of guilt and panic, continues to disguise his involvement in Vera's death, attributing his change of shirt to a strenuous badminton match. Esther is alerted to some sort of wrongdoing by his suspicious behaviour, but her attempts at gaining insight are thwarted by the dismissal of her approaches by him and other bureaucrats. When Rex is captured by the military contingent of the camp, Maloney visits him to ascertain what he knows. After Rex explains what he saw to Maloney, Maloney reveals his part in the incident. When Rex, like Vera, attempts to threaten him with prosecution on grounds of crimes against humanity, Maloney begins to torture Rex by probing his chest wound with a biro pen. When Esther finds them and discovers the Maloney's treachery he aims to kill her in unarmed combat. Esther fights back by gouging his eyes and using physical blows to wind him before choking him. Later, when Esther goes to retrieve his keys, Maloney recovers and attempts to kill her once more. Ralph, appalled at Maloney's actions, arrives in time to shoot Maloney, disabling him again and allowing Rex and Esther to escape the San Pedro camp. Blue-eyed Man American actor Teddy Sears played a representative of Torchwood's enemies, the Three Families, credited only as Blue-eyed man. He first appears in \\"The Categories of Life\\" where he informs Jilly Kitzinger that her work with Phicorp and Oswald Danes has got her noticed by the right people. After Danes and Kitzinger part company in \\"End of the Road\\", the blue-eyed man reappears and informs Kitzinger that her intern is a traitor and shoots her dead. He then offers Kitzinger a promotion working with The Families at a level beyond Phicorp. Two months later, he meets Kitzinger on a park bench and tells her that her work has been appreciated. He gives her a new identity, Lucy Statten Meredith, and informs her that she will be sent to Shanghai where she can see the truth behind the Miracle. In \\"The Blood Line\\", after the Miracle ends, Kitzinger tracks down the blue-eyed man at the park they met previously. He informs her that the Three Families intended the miracle as a \\"test-run\\" and that they have a Plan B which they are waiting to orchestrate. Angelo Colasanto Angelo Colasanto, portrayed by Italian actor Daniele Favilli, is introduced in \\"Immortal Sins\\". Angelo was raised as Catholic and was raised in a coastal Italian Village. He attempts to enter America via Ellis Island by stealing the visa of Jack Harkness, but is locked up and prepared to be deported back to Italy. Empathising with Angelo, Jack uses his Vortex Manipulator to forge a new identity slip so he can enter America. They then rent a room together in New York's Italian district where Jack seduces Angelo. Angelo is conflicted between his faith and sexuality; though Jack is not the first man he has slept with, he is the first to show tenderness to him. With Jack, Angelo becomes part of a plan to make money by selling sacramental wine. Almost immediately after obtaining the alcohol they are kidnapped. Instead of being killed, however, Jack convinces their captors to allow them to work for them, and were asked to transport a box between two warehouses. After convincing Jack he could cope with seeing new things, Jack decided to make Angelo his companion in the same way that the Doctor had enlisted Jack as companion. At the warehouse, Jack opened the box to reveal a brain parasite that the Trickster's Brigade were planning to use on future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which he destroys. The two men flee, but Jack is shot and Angelo arrested. A year later Angelo is released from prison and is shocked to find that Jack is alive when he should be dead. Jack informs him that he has obtained the same room from the previous year and invites Angelo back with him. Angelo conjectures that because he cannot die Jack is an embodiment of the devil, and stabs him. When Jack revives again, Angelo allows him to be taken to a butcher's shop where a crowd of people repeatedly kill him. Later, Angelo frees Jack and expresses remorse. However, Jack no longer trusts Angelo, and abandons him. In 2011 it is revealed that Angelo is still alive and possess knowledge of how the Miracle started. Thanks to Jack's warnings of the economic hard times of the future - including the Wall Street Crash of 1929 - Angelo managed to become wealthy, and lived in a mansion in Nevada. He is revealed to have allied with \\"the Families\\", a group formed by a pact between three mobsters in 1928 while Jack was being repeatedly murdered and resurrected, but his connection to the Families soured because they frowned on Angelo's relationship with Jack - a relationship he remembered fondly even after marrying and having children. Shortly after the Torchwood team arrived at the Colasanto estate, as Jack was saying goodbye to his former lover, Angelo suddenly dies‚Äîthe first true death since Miracle Day. It is discovered that Angelo had salvaged an alien null-field generator from the ruins of the Torchwood Hub in Cardiff, and had it installed beneath his bed. The null field disrupted the morphic field that Jack theorized was responsible for the Miracle in that one location, allowing Angelo to die naturally. Olivia Colasanto Olivia Colasanto, portrayed by Nana Visitor, is the granddaughter of Angelo Colasanto, who first appears in the episode \\"Immortal Sins\\". Olivia is involved in the plot to kidnap Gwen Cooper's family to force her to hand over Captain Jack Harkness. Upon Rex Matheson and Esther Drummond foiling her appropriation of Jack, and Sergeant Davidson rescuing Gwen's family, Olivia reveals her trump card - that Jack will still come with her as she can bring him to Angelo and thus enlighten him to how the Miracle started. Episode eight, \\"End of the Road\\" begins with Olivia bringing Jack and his Torchwood associates to the Colorado mansion where she lives with her grandfather Angelo, now a decrepit old man in a semi-vegetative state. Olivia states that although Angelo loved his wife, he never forgot about Jack, and would often tell stories about him. She also reveals that a disharmony arose between Angelo and the families because of Angelo's relationship with Jack, and makes clear the connection of the three families to the Miracle. After agent Shapiro arrives and places the rogue contingent of the CIA under arrest Olivia is also arrested and placed in a SUV vehicle ready for transportation. However, she is blown up by controller Brian Friedkin after he detonates an explosive device as he was ordered to do by the families. Allen Shapiro Allen Shapiro (John de Lancie) is introduced in the episode \\"End of the Road\\" as a senior CIA official. After Rex Matheson frames a rebel contingent of the CIA led by Brian Friedkin through use of the Torchwood contact lenses, Shapiro puts them under arrest along with Olivia Colasanto. He is enraged after Friedkin escapes questioning by blowing himself and the other captors to pieces. Though he pardons Rex and Esther, he remains suspicious of Jack and Gwen, and deports the latter, whilst trying to find out the secrets of a piece of Torchwood technology Jack wants to remain secret. Esther and Jack later escape, whilst Matheson reunites with Shapiro at the CIA central office in Washington. Two months after \\"End of the Road, Shapiro is still working with Rex to try and discover the secrets behind the Miracle. Despite identifying some traitors within the organisation, Shapiro remains oblivious to the identity of a further mole within the organisation, namely analyst Charlotte Wills, who is covertly working for the Families against the investigation. Shapiro authorises Rex to head to Argentina to investigate what, after getting in Torchwood, he believes to be an antipodal geological connection between Shanghai and Buenos Aires. Shapiro then tells his CIA colleagues to support Rex from Washington. However, Charlotte gets in touch with the Argentinian armed forces and they cause an explosion which Shapiro believes has killed Rex and colleague Esther. Furious, he orders Noah Vickers to rush through a use of new programming which can detect the presence of a mole by unscrambling all communications. Just as they discover Charlotte's duplicity, Shapiro and Noah are blown up by a bomb placed by Charlotte. The Mother Frances Fisher played the power-seeking 'Mother' in two episodes. The Mother, portrayed by actress Frances Fisher, appears as a high- ranking member of the Families, the main antagonists of Miracle Day. She operates the Shanghai site of the Blessing, a giant fissure running through the centre of the Earth between Shanghai and Buenos Aires. In \\"The Gathering\\", the Mother meets with the Families' newest recruit, Jilly Kitzinger, after she arrives in Shanghai, and introduces her to the Blessing. She tells Jilly that the Blessing \\"shows you to yourself\\" which she theorises is the Blessing's attempt to communicate with mankind. She enquires as to what Jilly sees in the Blessing, and appears impressed when Jilly sees only self-conviction. In \\"The Blood Line\\", the Mother reveals to Jilly that the Families intend to destroy the Blessing sites in Shanghai and Buenos Aires in order to prevent others from interfering with it, and dictates orders to have explosives placed round the site. However, Jack, Gwen and Oswald are able to infiltrate the site before they can do this. The Mother explains that Jack's blood is attracted to the Blessing as a result of the Families having fed his blood to it, and that this, in combination with humanity's morphic field, caused the human race to become immortal. She details the motives of the Families, who are intent on destabilising the human race so that they can take control and create a new world order. Realising that releasing his blood will reverse the Miracle, Jack threatens to do so, but the Mother laughs off this effort: Jack's blood would have to enter the Blessing from both ends. Her triumph is cut short when Rex, at the Buenos Aires site, reveals that Esther had transfused him with Jack's blood. As Rex and Jack release the blood into the Blessing, the site begins to quake, prompting the Families to evacuate. While Gwen, Jilly and Jack escape in a cargo lift, the Mother attempts to flee, but Oswald grabs her before detonating his explosive vest, bringing the whole site crashing down on top of them. Espenson identifies The Mother as part of an \\"intentionally multiple array of human villains\\" which serves to demonstrate that the series \\"isn't a story about a singular point of evil\\" but \\"a collective evil of humanity\\". The character is seen to speak fluent Mandarin Chinese; an aide was available on set to guide Fisher's pronunciation.

It was resolved in China's favor in 1922. During the First World War (1914‚Äì18), China supported the Allies on condition that the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory on the Shandong peninsula, which had belonged to the German Empire prior to its occupation by Japan in 1914, would be returned to China. In 1915, however, China reluctantly agreed to thirteen of Japan's original Twenty-One Demands which, among other things, acknowledged Japanese control of former German holdings. Britain and France promised Japan it could keep these holdings. In late 1918, China reaffirmed the transfer and accepted payments from Japan. Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles transferred the territory of Kiautschou as well as the rights, titles and privileges acquired by virtue of the Sino-German treaty of 1898 to the Empire of Japan rather than return them to the Chinese administration.A. Whitney Griswold, The Far Eastern Policy of the United States (1938) pp 239-68 Despite its formal agreement to Japan's terms in 1915 and 1918, China denounced the transfer of German holdings at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, with the strong support of President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. The Chinese ambassador to France, Wellington Koo, stated that China could no more relinquish Shandong, which was the birthplace of Confucius, the greatest Chinese philosopher, than could Christians concede Jerusalem. He demanded the promised return of Shandong, but to no avail. Japan prevailed. Chinese popular outrage over Article 156 led to demonstrations on 4 May 1919 and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement. As a result, Wellington Koo refused to sign the treaty. The US, finding itself isolated by all Great Powers, agreed to the Japanese, British and French demands. The Chinese public became outraged by the eventual treaty, accusing the Chinese government of seling out, and became disappointed by Wilson's failed promises.Chow Tse-Tsung: The May Fourth Movement. Intellectual Revolution in Modern China (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University), 1960. pp. 86-93 China's refusal to sign the Treaty of Versailles necessitated a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921. The Shandong dispute was mediated by the United States in 1922 during the Washington Naval Conference. In a victory for China, the Japanese leasehold on Shandong was returned to China in the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan, however, maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole.Griswold, The Far Eastern Policy of the United States (1938) pp 326-28 When its dominance in the province was threatened by the ongoing Northern Expedition to unite China in 1927‚Äì1928, Japan launched a series of military interventions, culminating in the Jinan incident conflict with Chinese Nationalist soldiers.

Background Dancer's Image was a gray horse owned and bred by businessman Peter D. Fuller of Runnymede Farm in North Hampton, New Hampshire, the son of former Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller. Originally named A.T.'s Image in memory of his father, Fuller renamed the horse Dancer's Image in preparation for sale at auction in February 1967, but ended up retaining ownership. The colt was trained by Lou Cavalaris Jr. and ridden in the Derby by jockey Bobby Ussery. Dancer's Image's father was Native Dancer, who won the Preakness Stakes, the Belmont Stakes, and was voted the United States Horse of the Year for 1954 and who, in turn, was a son of the 1945 Preakness Stakes winner, Polynesian. Racing career =Early career= At age two, Dancer's Image won graded stakes races in Maryland and at Woodbine Racetrack in Ontario, Canada. At age three, in the lead-up to the 1968 U.S. Triple Crown races, he won several more races including the Grade I Wood Memorial Stakes. For the Kentucky Derby, he was a second choice among bettors to Calumet Farm's Florida Derby and Blue Grass Stakes winner Forward Pass.1968 official Kentucky Derby chart =1968 Kentucky Derby= Dancer's Image was plagued by sore ankles during his career. On the Sunday prior to the 1968 Kentucky Derby, his handlers had a veterinarian give him a dose of phenylbutazone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to relieve inflammation of the joints. At the time, it was illegal for phenylbutazone to be in a horse's system on race day at Churchill Downs; however, Dancer's Image's veterinarian and handlers believed the medication would clear his system in time for the Derby. On Saturday, May 4, Dancer's Image won the Kentucky Derby, but was disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone were discovered in the mandatory post-race urinalysis. The disqualification was announced on Tuesday, May 7, with second-place finisher Forward Pass declared the winner and Dancer's Image moved to last. The controversy filled the sporting news of media outlets in North America and was a cover story for Sports Illustrated, which referred to it as \\"the year's major sports story.\\" The next disqualification of a Kentucky Derby winner happened in 2019, when Maximum Security was disqualified for impeding the progress of several other horses. =1968 Preakness Stakes= Dancer's Image ran in the 1968 Preakness Stakes, finishing third to Forward Pass. However, he was disqualified again and set back to eighth place, this time for bumping the horse Martins Jig. Continued ankle problems resulted in Dancer's Image being retired after the race. Kentucky Derby aftermath Fuller and the horse's handlers filed an appeal of the disqualification, as they believed someone else may have been motivated to give the colt another dose of phenylbutazone. The Kentucky State Racing Commission examined the matter and ordered distribution of the purse with first money to Forward Pass. Fuller took legal action and, in December 1970, a Kentucky Court awarded first-place money to Dancer's Image. The New York Times - December 12, 1970 article titled \\"Kentucky Court Awards First-Place Money in 68 Derby to Dancer's Image\\" That decision was overturned on appeal in April 1972 by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in Kentucky State Racing Comm'n v. Fuller, 481 S.W.2d 298 (Ky. 1972). Controversy and speculation still surround the incident, and in 2008 The New York Times called it \\"the most controversial Kentucky Derby ever\\". Forty years after the disqualification, owner Peter Fuller still believed he was a victim of a set-up, due to his being a wealthy civil rights sympathizer from Boston who offended the Kentucky racing aristocracy by donating Dancer's Image's $62,000 prize for a previous victory to Coretta Scott King two days after her husband's murder. Fuller said he had anticipated that someone might interfere with his colt and asked Churchill Downs officials to provide extra security before the race, but they denied the request. As of 2008, the Churchill Downs media guide for the Derby still included the official chart showing Dancer's Image as the winner. Legalized in 1974 by the Kentucky Racing Commission, phenylbutazone was so commonly used by 1986 that thirteen of the sixteen entrants in that year's Kentucky Derby were running on the medication.Lexington Herald-Leader - May 4, 1986 article titled \\"FIRST TWO HORSES ONLY ONES DRUG FREE\\" Stud record Dancer's Image was syndicated and sent to stand at stud at Glade Valley Farms in Frederick, Maryland. Eventually his owners sold the colt, and in 1974 he was sent to breeders in Ireland, then in 1979 to Haras du Quesnay at Deauville, France, owned by renowned breeder Alec Head. During his time in Europe he had success with sprinters including the Group One winners Godswalk, Lianga and Saritamer. Dancer's Image was later sent to stand at stud in Japan, where he died at age 27 on December 26, 1992. Pedigree See also * Mom's Command, another horse owned by Peter D.

Biography MIT Notable Events, 1895, in the Kendall/MIT subway stop, mentioning Underwood and Prescott. A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Underwood was the second son of William James Underwood, one of the nine children of William Underwood, the founder of the William Underwood Company. In late 1895, the William Underwood Company decided that they had had enough with tin cans that had \\"swells\\" in them, causing a great deal of product loss. This was a problem they had experienced since the company's founding in 1822. William Lyman decided late that year to visit MIT for assistance with this problem. Underwood approached William Thompson Sedgwick, the chair of the biology department at MIT about the concerns he had with the recent product swells and explosion of clams. Sedgwick then summoned his assistant Samuel Cate Prescott and apprised him on the issue. From late 1895 to late 1896, Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon, focusing on canned clams. They first discovered that the clams contained some heat-resistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing; then that these spores' presence depended on the clams' living environment; and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250ÀöF (121ÀöC) for ten minutes in a retort. These studies prompted the similar research of canned lobster, sardines, peas, tomatoes, corn, and spinach. Prescott and Underwood's work was first published in late 1896, with further papers appearing from 1897 to 1926. This research, though important to the growth of food technology, was never patented. During the research process, Underwood provided photomicrographic images of the bacteria that were involved in the research, which were magnified 650 times in 1896. A later research article in 1898 showed photography of bacteria magnified 1,000 times. This research proved beneficial to the William Underwood Company, the canning industry, the food industry, and food technology itself. Underwood retired from the William Underwood Company in 1899 to devote himself entirely to bacteriology studies at MIT. He would work at MIT without pay. This research and friendship with Prescott would continue until Underwood's death in 1929. Death and legacy In the late 1950s, the new president of the William Underwood Company, George Seybolt, was brought over by his predecessor, W. Durant, to MIT to meet Prescott (William Lyman Underwood had died in 1929). At the Institute of Food Technologists Northeast Section (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) meeting at Watertown, Massachusetts, in April 1961, the William Underwood Company dedicated a new laboratory in honor of both Prescott and William Lyman Underwood. Following Prescott's death in 1962, the Company created the Underwood Prescott Memorial Lectureship in memory of both Underwood and Prescott. This Lectureship would run until 1982. In 1969, Seybolt donated US$600,000 to MIT to create the Underwood Professorship, followed up with an Underwood Prescott Professorship in 1972. Three MIT faculty have held this professorship since its inception: Samuel A. Goldblith, Gerald N. Wogan, and since 1996, Stephen R. Tannebaum. Underwood was also a talented photographer. Besides images in microbiology, Underwood also photographed natural environment. His photographs were part of a book by John Burroughs as shown in the second and third external links listed below. One of Underwood's two brothers, Loring, was also an accomplished photographer as well. References *Goldblith, S.A. (1993). Pioneers in Food Science, Volume 1: Samuel Cate Prescott - M.I.T.

Missiles were fired at a madrassa in Chenagai village in Bajaur region of Pakistan. An eyewitness has stated that the madrassa was filled with local students who had resumed studies after the Eid ul-Fitr holiday. 82 people died in the attack. The United States was accused of the attacks. The U.S. government denied involvement in the attack. Long War Journal blamed U.S. for the air strike as only U.S. was able to conduct precision night strikes in the region. Later on it was found that United States was indeed responsible for the airstrike.  Background  In January 2006, US forces in Afghanistan carried out an airstrike in Bajaur's Damadola village which US officials tried to cover up by saying it was aimed at al-Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al- Zawahiri. However, Al-Zawahiri never went to Bajaur.  The airstrike  The attack took place in Chenagai village near the town of Khar, the main town in Bajaur region. The leader of the madrassa, cleric Maulana Liaqat Ullah Hussain, was suspected to be sheltering al-Qaeda militants and was among the dead. Locals claimed that the missiles were fired by US drones. =U.S. involvement= According to the American Broadcasting Company, the attack was launched by a MQ-1 Predator with Ayman al-Zawahiri as its intended target. However, the report's author has since been removed from ABC's site due to questions concerning the reliability of his reporting. Pakistani officials have claimed that the strike was conducted by the U.S. and that they have also requested the U.S. not to violate their sovereignty again. Local people claimed the victims included boys as young as 12. Long War Journal, after conducting analysis of the strike, claimed that strike was indeed carried out U.S. as Pakistan does not possess capabilities to conduct precision night strikes. Later on, it was found that U.S. was indeed responsible for the airstrike.  Reaction  There were angry reactions in response to the strike. Many Muslim groups have condemned the action. Siraj-ul-Haq, the senior Minister and Provincial Chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, resigned from the provincial cabinet in protest against the strikes. Sahibzada Haroonur Rashid, MNA (Member of National Assembly) from Bajaur Agency, also resigned from the National Assembly in protest.

The film, co- directed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, was made in CinemaScope and Eastmancolor. Although well received critically at the time, it was not a commercial success, and is widely regarded as the last of the major MGM dance oriented musicals. In recent years it has been recognized as a seminal film because of the inventiveness of its dance routines. It's Always Fair Weather is noted for its downbeat theme, which may have hurt it at the box office, and has been called a rare \\"cynical musical\\". Plot Three ex-G.I.s, Ted Riley (Kelly), Doug Hallerton (Dailey) and Angie Valentine (Kidd) have served in World War II together and become best friends. At the beginning of the film, set in October 1945, they dance through the street celebrating their upcoming release from the service (\\"The Binge\\") and meet at their favorite New York bar. They vow eternal friendship, and before going their separate ways, promise to reunite exactly ten years later at the same spot. In the years after the war, the three men have taken entirely different paths (\\"10-Year Montage\\"). Riley, who had wanted to become an idealistic lawyer, has become a fight promoter and gambler, associating with shady underworld characters. Hallerton, who had planned to become a painter, has gone into a high-stress job in advertising, and his marriage is crumbling. Valentine, who had planned to become a gourmet chef, is now running a hamburger stand in Schenectady, New York that he calls \\"The Cordon Bleu\\", and has a wife and children. The three men keep their promise to meet at the bar ten years later, and quickly realize that they now have nothing in common and dislike each other. Hallerton and Riley view Valentine as a \\"hick\\", while Riley and Valentine think Hallerton is a \\"snob\\", and Hallerton and Valentine think Riley is a \\"punk\\". Sitting together in an expensive restaurant as Hallerton's guest, munching celery, they silently express their regrets in \\"I Shouldn't Have Come\\", sung to the tune of \\"The Blue Danube\\". At the restaurant, they encounter some people from Hallerton's advertising agency, including Jackie Leighton (Charisse), an attractive and brainy advertising person. Jackie gets the idea of reuniting the three men later that evening on a TV show hosted by Madeline Bradville (Gray). She and Riley gradually become involved, though at first Jackie seems motivated by wanting to get Riley on her show. She joins Riley at Stillman's gym, where Jackie demonstrates a deep knowledge of boxing while cavorting with beefy boxers (\\"Baby You Knock Me Out\\"). Riley gets into trouble with gangsters because he refuses to fix a fight. As he seeks to evade gangsters from a roller skating ring, he skates out on the streets of Manhattan, where he realizes that Jackie's affection for him has built up his self-esteem, and he dances exuberantly on roller skates (\\"I Like Myself\\"). Hallerton, meanwhile, has misgivings about the corporate life (\\"Situation-Wise\\"). The three men are reluctantly coaxed into the TV reunion, with the gangsters tracking Riley to the studio. They jointly fight and defeat the gangsters, which brings them back together and escape from the studio when the police arrive. At the end they are friends again, but go their separate ways without making plans for another reunion (\\"The Time for Parting\\").

At Kelly's insistence, however, they made it into an MGM musical. Kelly, at this point in his life, had been making films in Europe such as Invitation to the Dance, to take advantage of a tax law for resident Americans. But the films in Europe failed and the tax law was revoked, forcing Kelly to return to America. MGM, under new production chief Dore Schary, did not want to hire either Sinatra or Munshin; the former due to his difficult working reputation, the latter because he was not popular with audiences anymore. Ultimately, Kelly chose fellow dancers Dan Dailey, who was under contract to MGM, and Michael Kidd, who had more choreographic than acting experience (he choreographed the Broadway and film versions of Guys and Dolls, as well as The Band Wagon). Kelly was also forced to shoot the movie in Cinemascope, which he felt did not suit screen dancing. Many of the numbers in the film, such as \\"The Binge\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time\\" show Kelly's efforts to make use of Cinemascope. Comden and Green wrote the songs with Andr√© Previn providing the music as well as the accompanying score; it was his second major assignment on an MGM film, after Bad Day at Black Rock. Kelly asked his old friend and collaborator Stanley Donen to co-direct with him. Donen, who had just scored a major success with Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (with Kidd as choreographer), did not want to go back to collaborating with Kelly, but reluctantly agreed. Kelly and Donen clashed over creative issues in the film, with Donen tending to side with Kidd against Kelly. After this film, Donen and Kelly never worked together again, and their friendship ended permanently, as Donen later confirmed. Reception It's Always Fair Weather received good reviews when it came out, Variety calling it a \\"delightful musical satire\\", while Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote it was a \\"bright film\\" that spoofed \\"the whiskers off TV\\". It was also voted one of the year's 10 best films by the New York Film Critics. However, the studio did not open it with the fanfare it had given previous musicals. Instead it was released as part of a drive-in double bill with Bad Day at Black Rock, and the studio did not make its money back. The film's bleakness may have had something to do with it (audiences at the time were not accustomed to unhappy musicals); but also, more Americans were staying at home with television than going to the movies at this time. Andr√© Previn claims the film's failure had to do with its being a musical; he felt that it would have been a good film had it not had any songs. In her book 5001 Nights at the Movies, critic Pauline Kael called the film a \\"delayed hangover\\", and wrote that its \\"mixture of parody, cynicism and song and dance is perhaps a little sour\\". She had praise for Dailey's \\"Situationwise\\" number and wrote that \\"to a great extent this is Dailey's movie\\". The film was nominated in 1955 for Academy Awards for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and for Best Story and Screenplay. In recent years, the film has gained reputation in the minds of musical and Kelly fans, who point to \\"I Like Myself\\", his dance on roller skates, as the last great dance solo of his career. Scenes from the film were included in MGM's That's Entertainment, Part II, hosted by Kelly and Fred Astaire.

The pattern consists of hard lined geometric shapes, aiming to create a camouflage pattern effective in the temperate forests and plains of Sweden. It is affectionately known among Swedish soldiers as l√∂vh√∂gen, or \\"the leaf pile.\\" In addition to the standard pattern, which was designed with Swedish forests in mind, desert and jungle variants were later developed for international missions. History =FOA camouflage= AJ-37 Viggen in FOA camouflage. The forerunner of the M90 uniform pattern was a vehicle camouflage known as the FOA camouflage, in reference to the military research institute that developed it. The Swedish government had decided in the 1960s to fund and develop a domestic camouflage design, instead of copying a pattern used by another nation. This was in part to guarantee maximum effectiveness in Swedish terrain, but also to ensure that the Swedish Armed Forces would use a recognizably Swedish design. The intent was to establish the new pattern as national symbol, in the hope that it could be helpful in making citizens identify with the armed forces. Work on the vehicle camouflage pattern was carried out in the 1970s by FOA scientists through a process of extensive testing and experimentation, including aerial photography missions and field trials. When the pattern was rolled out in the 1970s, it became known as \\"FOA camouflage,\\" reflecting its origin. Early use of the FOA camouflage on Swedish aircraft, especially the AJ-37 Viggen, also led to it being referred to as Viggenkamouflage. Swedish military doctrine at the time assumed a defensive war against the superior forces of the Soviet Union, which made it too risky for jets to remain on their peacetime bases. Instead, they would be dispersed across small rural landing strips and pre- positioned depots where they could be serviced by mobile teams, which required a camouflage designed for hiding in forested locations. =M90 Uniform Camouflage= Swedish Marine at Berga navy base. For the ordinary soldier, Sweden retained its old single-colored field uniforms, the dark olive green M59 (summer) and the all-grey M58 (winter), long after other Western nations developed uniform camouflage. Only in the 1980s was a decision taken to readapt the vehicle-size FOA pattern, which had been designed to avoid detection by aerial and satellite photography, for use on personal uniforms, which would primarily aim to avoid detection by the naked eye and by binocular. This required a redesign of the pattern. FOA scientists were again called on to lead the project, redesigning the pattern slightly and reducing its scale by a proportion of 1:66 to fit the entire pattern onto a human torso. Despite the downscaling, the process nevertheless produced a camouflage pattern with what remains an unusually large and \\"clean\\" set of colored fields, in comparison with other nations' camouflage designs. In part, this reflected Swedish operational concerns. According to Hans Kariis, an expert at FOI, which is the successor to FOA: \\"If you look at American or German patterns, they're very small. This has to do with the M90 pattern being adapted to the type of combat envisioned at the time. Our pattern works pretty well in forest and mixed [sm√•bruten] terrain, where distances are at a scale of about one kilometer. The Americans are thinking about urban combat, in a city where distances are 10 to 100 meters.\\" The M90 uniform pattern was ultimately introduced in active service in the late 1980s, and had been adapted by the entire force by the late 1990s. As Sweden had been a latecomer to camouflage uniforms, the system was considered to be quite advanced for its time and, according to the Swedish army, it remains effective three decades later. Among other things, M90 uniforms are treated to ensure a low visibility when faced with night-time detection gear such as near-infrared spectrum equipment. However, while vehicle camouflage such as the FOA pattern had a proven value as a protection overhead and long-distance reconnaissance, the effectiveness of personal camouflage is in some dispute. According to experts, the old all-green M59 uniforms often provided similar levels of protection against detection as the camouflage-patterned M90. \\"It depends on the environment you're in,\\" according to Kariis. \\"In some cases [the M90] is better: the pattern breaks up contours and makes it more difficult to spot the contour of a human being. In many other cases the pattern is of equal value to single-color.\\" Lack of copyright protections Since the M90 was never copyrighted by the Swedish government, it has become available on a variety of commercial clothing and other products. To some experts, this has in fact been advantageous for the Swedish military, since it has allowed its personnel to acquire complementary nonstandard civilian gear, when necessary, without abandoning the M90 pattern. However, others have countered that the proliferation of non-official M90 products has diluted the symbolic value of the pattern, defeating one of its original purposes ‚Äì and possibly even raising infiltration risks in the field. Possible redesign In 2017, a collaborative Nordic government project was launched to jointly acquire standardized uniforms for the Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Danish armed forces, although it was decided that each country would use its own camouflage pattern. As part of this process, Sweden deliberated whether to update the M90 pattern and, simultaneously, acquire copyright protections for the new version. In 2019, the Swedish armed forces were reportedly still considering whether to design a new pattern. Uniform Models The M90K Camouflage Pattern The uniform is available in several different models. * M90F: the F stands for F√§lt, Field, and this is the standard uniform for general issue throughout the Swedish armed forces. * M90P: the P stands for Pansar, Armour, and this model is issued to armoured vehicle crews. It features padding on elbows and knees, suspenders, a shorter jacket, ankle pockets and penholders on the sleeves. It is also made from a heavier material providing better fire protection. * M90H: the H stands for Helikopter, Helicopter. This is the model issued to helicopter crews. The jacket is bright orange on the inside. The changing missions for the Swedish armed forces, with a heavier emphasis on missions abroad, has led to two new models. * M90L: Mostly used in peacetime for domestic indoor and summer use. The L stands for L√§tt, Light. This uniform is made from thinner fabrics and buttons for rolling up the sleeves. * M90TR (Tropik) For forces working in rain forest environments. Similar in appearance to the M90L but the fabric is even thinner and with more subdued colours. * M90TR BE (Tropik Beige) (Khaki) For forces working in desert environments. Similar to the M90TR but with the splinter pattern in desert colours. The M90TR BE system also includes a smock because nights in desert environments can be very cold. *M90K or √∂kenkamouflage (Desert) is for forces operating in Afghanistan and surrounding areas. It uses warm greys, beige, and browns to create an effective camouflage.

It traces its roots back to the landing of the Rev. Joseph Dunwell on 1 January 1835 in Cape Coast, in the Gold Coast (now Ghana).F.L.Bartels. The Roots of Ghana Methodism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965, pp. 12‚Äì18. The Rev. T. B. Freeman, another missionary, took the Christian message beyond Cape Coast to the Ashanti Kingdom, to Nigeria, and to other parts of the region to become the father of Methodism in West Africa.F.L.Bartels.

For the most part, the Methodist Church Ghana follows the same Sunday worship practices as other Methodist Church branches. Methodist Church Ghana separates itself from the mainline Methodist Church of Great Britain in approach through the addition of Charismatic elements to the worship services. This approach to worship displays a more vibrant and energetic form of praise. Methodist Church Ghana is responsible for a large part of its community's outreach. Like many other mainline Protestant churches, the church provides formal education through schooling for Ghanaians. This educational role for Methodist Church Ghana in particular has helped the country provide a strong educational system that can accommodate the Ghanaian population, which is pivotal because the options for university in Ghana are scarce and competitive. Methodist Church Ghana is a big medical care provider in its area, as well. The medical work done by Methodist Church Ghana has served a vast part of the local community by offering important health services to Ghanaians. Methodist Church Ghana also took initiative to remodel and reconstruct a local hospital to broaden its outreach and possibilities for medical care for its community. Ethnic divisions have plagued the administration of Methodist Church Ghana. These problems arose from differences in ethnicity regarding power positions and church format. For instance, during an election for the presidency of the denomination in the 1980s, people were vouching for their own ethnic president and a conflict of interest between some ethnic groups occurred. Challenges like these have led to dismissals and resignations of ministers, and even the creation of new churches and circuits. History In the mid 1800s many European missionaries traveled to new countries to spread religious influences. Gold Coast (now Ghana) was already known for its big reserves of gold and as a major port for the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The Asante people ruled large portions of Gold Coast, and in 1824 British forces invaded and defeated many Asante forces. This shifted the Gold Coast towards British control, subjecting the current citizens to British influence. By 1835, many other European nations had taken an interest in the resources of the land. This brought many missionaries, including Protestants from the Netherlands and Catholics from Portugal and France. As part of this wave of missions, the Missionary Committee of the British Methodist Conference sent Rev. Joseph Rhodes Dunwell to be the first Methodist missionary in Gold Coast. His mission began in 1835 in the prominent fishing city of Cape Coast. After six months of mission work with local Christians, he succeeded in his evangelical missions and Methodist Church Gold Coast (Methodist Church Ghana after independence was gained in 1957) was founded. This influence spread throughout the country, and as a result the British claimed Gold Coast as a colony in 1867.Bartels, Francis Lodowic. The Roots of Ghana Methodism. Cambridge Univ. Press, 1965. By 1854, the church was organized into circuits, a collection of ambient Methodist churches that formed an administrative coalition, forming a district, or an area with Methodist control; T. B. Freeman served as chairman. Freeman was replaced in 1856 by William West. The district was divided and extended to include areas in Gold Coast and Nigeria, also a British colony at the time, by the synod, an administrative church council, in 1878, a move confirmed at the British Conference. The districts were Gold Coast District, with T. R. Picot as chairman, and Yoruba and Popo District, with John Milum as chairman. Methodist evangelisation of Northern Gold Coast began in 1910. After serving as a district in the British Methodist Conference, the Methodist Church Ghana attained full independence from that British body on 28 July 1961. It adopted an episcopal structure at the Koforidua Conference in August 1999.The Methodist Church Ghana (1835‚Äì2005): 170th Anniversary Souvenir Brochure.

Sunday mornings are typically worship services. These services are where the Bible is read, sermons are given, and offerings are donated to the church. There can also be a first and second service, where the difference is one service uses English and the other service uses the native language of the area.Edusa-Eyison, Joseph MY. \\"The History of the Methodist Church Ghana.\\" (2011). The Methodist Church of Ghana uses the same hymn book that is approved and used by the British Methodist church. Some time in the 1990s, the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly translated the English hymns into the now used and locally understood Twi-language version. Following this change, multiple Methodist churches in Ghana translated the main British hymns into their own native languages, including Ewe and Ga. The Methodist Church was the first to add native songs to praise and worship services in Ghana.Flolu, James. \\"Music teacher education in Ghana: Training for the churches or the schools?.\\" Sounds of Change‚ÄìSocial and Political Features of Music in Africa. Stockholm: SIDA (2004): 164-179. The first liturgy accepted was a 1936 version of the English liturgy. This liturgy was limited in ways of worship and expression. The liturgy was then revised in 2000. The changes were intended to match the Ghanaian character on display during services, and the new liturgy cover topics such as what the choir would wear and the general setup of buildings. This new and more charismatic liturgy was intended to allow the worshipers to add a more vibrant and jubilant interpretation of praise, intended to make a more spiritual presence for services. Charismatic Movement In the late 1960s, Charismatic Christianity spread into Ghana. This new form of Christianity was a faster paced, more vibrant, and more kinetic form of Christianity. Many West Africans found this form of Christianity more appealing than the more staid church services favored by older congregations. At this time, many religious churches were competing for African locals as congregation members, and the adoption of charismatic Christianity was a major distinction between churches. This charismatic spread allowed any church that used this method of practice to gain a boost in congregation members and this left any church not following suit at a loss or stagnancy in terms of turnout.Ebenezer Obadare (2016) The Muslim response to the Pentecostal surge in Nigeria: Prayer and the rise of charismatic Islam, Journal of Religious and Political Practice, 2:1,75-91 The first charismatic praise group arose in Kumasi: the Methodist Prayer Fellowship, which began in 1984. A few years after its first national assembly, the Methodist Church Ghana wanted to replicate this charismatic worship service. This decision encouraged the church to spread the charismatic movement throughout the whole congregation instead of just one focused group. With this idea came the Methodist Prayer and Renewal Program (MPRP), a group dedicated to making certain that the charismatic methods touched every area of the church. This group not only spread the charismatic movement throughout the mainline Protestant Methodist church in Ghana's cities, but also to smaller churches in villages. Due to the influence of the movement, some non-ordained charismatic leaders were formally appointed as evangelists due to their commitment to their work.Omenyo, Cephas. \\"From the Fringes to the Centre: Pentecostalization of the Mainline churches in Ghana.\\" Exchange 34.1 (2005): 39-60. As part of the charismatic movement, clergy and congregants have incorporated more in-church prayer. Churches regularly hold short fasting and prayer events every Friday, with certain monthly prayer meetings beginning early and proceeding through the night. These events have resulted in a boost in attendance, which has contributed to member participation. The numbers show over five-hundred people a day in attendance at some congregations. This new movement has added a homelike and curative aspect through these consistent meetings. Congregation members note that these events bring the gift of healing and there are reports from the National Crusade organized by the Methodist Church Ghana. Most charismatic meetings were promoted through media advertisements, breaking news reports, the creation of artistic banners, guest shout outs and advertisements on radio stations, the handing out of flyers and pamphlets, and most effectively through word of mouth. Role in health and education In the 1970s in Ghana, being admitted into university was a difficult proposition due to the small number of schooling options and the extremely low admittance rate, since there were far more applicants than available slots. This led the Ghanaian government to look towards non- governmental associations to make higher education more accessible. In 1974, Dr. John Kofi Agbeti, the first Ghanaian Methodist minister to earn a Ph.D, wanted to create a higher educational establishment that would accept and support all variations of Christianity. In 1998 during their yearly conference, Methodist Church Ghana made Dr. Agbeti's suggestion for a university a reality and the decision resulted in Methodist University College Ghana, being constructed on a two-square-mile plot with classes beginning in 2000. The Methodist Church University, Ghana illustrated its core values and ideals with a seven piece plan: First, to avail a safe educational environment where students could utilize its programs and resources to learn a liberal and technical education to fit the needs of the country. Second, to sponsor research in order to harvest knowledge for application towards any problem. Third, to develop the student's ability to critically think and problem solve. Fourth, to be a home for all students regardless of gender, religion, or racial identity. Fifth, to give students the top professional and innovative training possible. Sixth, to promote hard work and strengthen the student's connection to their African background. Seventh, to spread Christianity and endorse the giving of the student's life to God. Another important school that the Methodist Church Ghana constructed was Cape Coast's Mfantispim. This school was responsible for educating John Mensah Sarbah, the head of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society, Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a leader in the founding of the West African Congress, and other prominent figures in African history. The Methodist Church Ghana has placed an importance on its medical work since its construction. With the help of the government, for multiple decades Methodist Church Ghana has contributed health-care services. The division of Health and Sanitation is under the Methodist Church Ghana Board of Social Responsibility and Rural Development. Miriam Hornsby Odoi, a worker for the Diocese who directs Methodist Church Ghana's health programs, states that the church's involvement in medical work comes from Jesus Christ when his disciples were local healers and spirit purifiers. Odoi also states that the importance of the medical work is to complete mental, social, and physical well-being. The church controls the Ankaase Methodist Faith Hospital. A congregational member, J. K. Manu, modeled, designed, and built the two- story medical center. A representative of the church then negotiated with the administration for the proper rights to operate and run the hospital. After expanding the property and adding medically trained professionals, on September 24, 1988 the hospital opened to the public. This church uses a combination of westernized medicine with spiritual healing. Since then the church has convinced many investors to contribute monetary donations to the hospital and the church has implemented chaplains to run the medical center. This is now a prominent health center in Ghana. The Methodist Revival was a movement held by the Methodist Church Britain to reach citizens who felt neglected by the Church of England. Because many Ghanaian churches also serve as a local school, Methodist Church Ghana incorporated this movement for the locals and used this opportunity to educate students about its religion and taught any citizen, young or old to read and write. This also helped educate citizens who previously couldn't afford schooling.Graham, Charles Kwesi. The History of Education in Ghana: From the Earliest Times to the Declaration of Independence. Routledge, 2013. Challenges The Methodist Church Ghana has not always had success in its endeavors. The church has faced congregation- dividing problems. Methodist Church Ghana originally regarded itself as an Akan-dominated church, but this idea was challenged. One issue arose due to differences in ethnic backgrounds among congregants. In the 1920s, Methodist Church Ghana had three congregations in Accra. Many of these congregation members were of the Ga ethnicity, followed in population by Fante people. Many Sunday schools used Fante-Akan as the primary language for service, so Ga people had to accommodate themselves to Fante preferences. In 1965 the Fante people made their own church building, called themselves the Cavalry Society, and placed their building in an area that would change their closest proximity circuit, Wesley Circuit, to the Adabraka Circuit. In an attempt to be impartial, Methodist Church Ghana assigned neutral parties within its church council to decide on a sanction for the Calvary Society's infraction. In an attempt to act impartially, Methodist Church Ghana assigned expatriate parties to give opinions on the matter. The proposal from the neutral parties suggested that the circuits be reorganized to accommodate language barriers within the circuits. This suggestion was declined and the Calvary Society petitioned to become its own separate circuit. After a long struggle with some bureaucratic policies, Calvary Society's request to become a circuit was approved and the name changed to the North-Accra circuit.Essamuah, Casely B. Genuinely Ghanaian: a History of the Methodist Church, Ghana, 1961-2000. Africa World, 2011. Another ethnic problem manifested by way of cultural leadership. In the 1980s there was a conflict between two ethnic groups, as a Fante native and a Ga native debated which of these two ethnic groups should control the conference's presidency. Another problem became the struggle for power between the people's democratic control and the hierarchical control of the church. Many conferences were called to sort out the power struggle and arguments about certain interpretations of the church's constitution arose. Many times the ethnic-bias issue was exposed, and other times the underlying thought served as a basis for other arguments. These debates about the constitution's clarifications came at a price, as the debates led to the suspension and resignation of church ministers. Presidents and presiding bishops *Francis C.F.

The show starred Terence Longdon as airman Garry Halliday. The episodes were based on books by Justin Blake: Justin Blake was in fact a pseudonym for the writers John Griffith Bowen and Jeremy Bullmore. Plot Reminiscent of Biggles, Halliday was a pilot for a commercial airline, Halliday Charter Company, and flew to his adventures in an aircraft with the call sign Golf Alpha Oboe Roger George. He was assisted by co-pilot Bill Dodds, played by Terence Alexander, who was later Charlie in Bergerac. The airline's control base station was Lima Foxtrot.Garry Halliday Their enemy was The Voice, played by Elwyn Brook-Jones, so called because he was never seen by other characters, so that at the end of each series he could escape and reappear in the next. Invisible even to his own gang, The Voice at first shone a powerful light in their faces to disguise his identity; later he used closed-circuit television. Production Based on the books by Justin Blake, one trailer special and two series were produced. Each episode lasted 25 minutes: *Garry Halliday - 1 episode *Garry Halliday and the Gun-Runners - 16 episodes *Garry Halliday and the Secret of Omar Khayyam - 33 episodes Series three hit difficulties, as actor Bill Kerr playing co-pilot Eddie Robbins replaced Terence Alexander; while Brook-Jones died half way through filming, and was replaced (without his scenes being refilmed) by an actor who looked and sounded different. Maurice Kaufmann played one of The Voice's henchmen in series three. Filming was at Ferryfield Airport in Lydd, Kent, with the offices and planes of Silver City Airways transformed for all three series. The programme was transmitted in the Saturday afternoon teatime slot subsequently occupied by Doctor Who, which started on BBC in November 1963. It was a popular slot for a family audience. In early 1963, it was used for another adventure series for children, The Chem. Lab. Mystery. After the success of the first series of Doctor Who, with its sci-fi content, there appeared no interest in returning to the more traditional Garry Halliday stories and the show was dropped. Only one episode survives in the BBC archives.\\"Garry Halliday\\", lostshows.com In popular culture Garry Halliday makes an appearance in The Black Dossier by Alan Moore, his name slightly altered to Gary Haliday, encountering Mina Murray and Alan Quatermain in a new spaceport in Birmingham. The Voice is mentioned in passing in a fictional document detailing The League's activities during World War II (When They Sound The Last All Clear).

The Dungannon man was manager on and off for nearly twenty five years, leading Tyrone to their first two periods of relative success - the All-Ireland Finals of 1986 and 1995. Although they never won the All-Ireland under his management, McRory is still regarded as one of the great Tyrone managers, having won an unprecedented five Ulster Championships under his guidance (1984, 1986, 1995, 1996, 2001). He formed an extremely productive relationship with Eugene McKenna, both when McKenna was a player under McRory, and as a manager alongside him. He left Tyrone management in 2002, after a disappointing exit in the Championship Qualifiers to an unfancied Sligo, ostensibly due to health concerns, but there is also speculation the parting with the Tyrone County board was acrimonious. This paved the way for his successor, Mickey Harte, who has guided Tyrone to three All-Ireland crowns. He has a keen interest in classical music, and has been seen at operas by sports journalists.

Zum 40. Todestag Hermynia Zur M√ºhlens', in Siglinde Bolbecher, Literatur in der Peripherie, 1992, p.208. Quoted in Lionel Grossman, 'Remembering Hermynia Zur M√ºhlen: A Tribute'. A committed socialist from a Viennese aristocratic Catholic family, she was sometimes called the Red Countess. Life The Countess Folliot de Crenneville, born as Hermine Isabelle Maria Gr√§fin Folliot de Crenneville in Vienna, was the great granddaughter of Louis Charles Folliot de Crenneville, a French-born general who fought for the Habsburg Monarchy in the Napoleonic Wars. Her maternal grandfather was the diplomat Ferdinand, Count von Wydenbruck, who had married a politically liberal woman from the Anglo-Irish gentry. Growing up in the Governorate of Estonia, where her father was a diplomat, she was sent aged 30 to a pulmonary sanatorium in Davos. Here she began a career of translation into German, translating an anti-war novel by Leonid Andreyev,Leonid Andreyev: Das Joch des Krieges, Max Rascher Verlag 1918. and in 1918 King Coal by Upton Sinclair. An unhappy marriage to Viktor von zur M√ºhlen, a conservative German landowner, was officially ended in 1923. By this time she had met Stefan Klein, a German Jew and fellow translator who would be her partner for the rest of her life. Zur M√ºhlen wrote six detective novels under the name Lawrence H. Desberry, and collections of fairy tales interpreted from a radical perspective. She also wrote anecdotes, sketches and feuilletons for periodical publication. She published an autobiographical memoir, End und Anfang, in 1929, in which the new beginning is that of the Russian Revolution. Though she quietly left the Communist Party around 1931 or 1932, she remained committed to socialism. Zur M√ºhlen and Klein left Germany for Vienna in 1933. Zur M√ºhlen refused to agree to S. Fischer Verlag's appeal that she follow Thomas Mann, Alfred D√∂blin, Ren√© Schickele and Stefan Klein in undertaking not to write in √©migr√© magazines: Unsere T√∂chter die Nazinen was a directly anti- Nazi satire: serialized in the Territory of the Saar Basin in a leftwing newspaper in 1934,Wilhelm Kuehs (2002): Hermynia Zur M√ºhlen (1883-1952), p. 1 (pdf). it was banned after eventually finding a publisher in 1936. With the Anschluss of 1938, Zur M√ºhlen and Klein left for Bratislava, where they married. After the German occupation of Bohemia in March 1939, they had to escape again; via Budapest, Yugoslavia, Italy, Switzerland and France, they reached London on 19 June 1939.Wilhelm Kuehs (2002): Hermynia Zur M√ºhlen (1883-1952), p. 2 (pdf). In London, Zur M√ºhlen scraped a precarious living from journalism. The two novels she wrote in England - Ewiges Schattenspiel and Als der Fremde kam - seem to have been part of an intended trilogy.

History The band's original line-up included vocalist/bassist Steve Hovington, guitarist Paul Statham, keyboardist Rick Holliday and drummer Graham Boffey. B-Movie's initial 1980 EP releases, the Take Three 7\\" and Nowhere Girl 12\\", were issued on the small UK indie label Dead Good Records. They were eventually signed to the Some Bizzare label, and their song \\"Moles\\" was featured on the original 1981 Some Bizzare Album. In 1981, B-Movie signed with Phonogram imprint Deram, and had their biggest UK commercial success with the single \\"Remembrance Day\\", which reached No. 61 on the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up single, \\"Marilyn Dreams\\", failed to chart. In 1982, they re- released \\"Nowhere Girl\\" as a single, which reached No. 67 in the UK, but there was no immediate follow-up or full-length album. A revolving door of members started at this point. Drummer Boffey left and was replaced by Andy Johnson, while Martin Winter (aka Smedley) joined on bass. Next, Holliday left in 1983 to form Six Sed Red with Soft Cell associate Cindy Ecstasy (their biggest success came when Six Sed Red's song \\"Dream Baby\\" was covered by Bananarama on that band's 1984 eponymous LP). Statham switched from guitar to keyboards and was briefly replaced by Stuart McLean (Charming Snakes) for a tour of Israel. B-Movie then resurfaced in early 1984 (with Al Cash on drums) with the single \\"A Letter from Afar\\", produced by John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez but it only reached No. 81 on the UK Singles Chart. Cash then left, leaving B-Movie as a three piece of Hovington, Statham and Winter augmented by session players. Towards the end of 1985, they finally released an album on Sire Records called Forever Running, containing re-recorded versions of their two hits, but both it and the single \\"Switch On - Switch Off\\" were flops despite a tour to promote them. The band broke up soon after. Frontman Hovington formed a band called One in the late 1980s with Seven Webster and drummer Bob Thompson, releasing an album and two singles on Chrysalis. He later formed another band called Laughing Gas, releasing one 7\\" single. B-Movie at Hope and Anchor, June 2013 After his departure, Boffey joined Slaughterhouse 5, releasing two singles, \\"Pathetic Girlfriend\\" and \\"Things She Did\\", and an album, Wide Open on IRS. After this venture, Boffey and Davy Lawrence formed Enormous. Guitarist Statham collaborated with ex-Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy, successfully participating as part of Murphy's solo backing band, The Hundred Men. He co-wrote and performed on Murphy's solo albums Love HysteriaRaggett, Ned \\"[ Love Hysteria Review]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-06-05 (1988) and Deep (1990). He co-wrote Dido's first single \\"Here with Me\\", which became an international hit single, and also the title track of her 2001 album No Angel, which has sold almost 20 million copies. Statham also cowrote several songs, including \\"Return of the King\\", on Simple Minds singer Jim Kerr's first solo album, Lostboy! AKA Jim Kerr. After a long hiatus, B-Movie reformed and played one-off shows in October 2004 (with the original lineup) and March 2006 (featuring Hovington and Statham) at The Metro nightclub in London, followed by additional one-off shows from the original lineup in Mansfield, Nottingham, London and Germany. In 2012, they digitally released the track Echoes, their first new release in 22 years. This was followed in 2013 by the Distant Skies EP and The Age of Illusion album, both available digitally and on CD. The band played a short tour in June 2013, visiting Portsmouth, Cambridge, London and Nottingham. Their third studio album, Climate of Fear, was released on 18 March 2016. It included new material as well as a rerecorded version of \\"Nowhere Girl\\". On 23 July 2018, B-Movie previewed two tracks from the forthcoming Take 2 EP on Statham's label Loki Records.

The series debuted on January 7, 2007, and was canceled on April 5, 2008, with 29 episodes produced. Since the series' cancellation, Nickelodeon and The N continued to air reruns until December 26, 2008. BET also aired reruns of the series until 2009. After several years, reruns made a short-lived return on MTV2, with only 6 episodes airing on October 16, 2016. Premise The show follows the exploits and actions of Jordan Lewis, who has moved to Los Angeles from Little Rock. He has to work in his gruff grandfather's diner, and survive with a silly younger sister, a critical cousin, and his over-protective mom who seems to know all his misdeeds before he even conceives of them. Production The first season of Just Jordan had 13 episodes, and ran from January 7, 2007 to August 10, 2007. The second season, which was filmed in front of a live studio audience, began September 16, 2007 and ended on March 2, 2008, with the two-part episode \\"Picture Me Rollin'\\". The third season saw only three episodes produced, which were later added to season two. Production of the series was halted due to the 2007‚Äì08 writer's strike, with Nickelodeon making the decision to cancel the series. In all, the second season had a total of 16 episodes. Characters * Jordan James Lewis (played by Lil' JJ) is 16 -years-old who is the main character of the series. Jordan usually speaks his mind before thinking about it. His parents are divorced, and he moved with his mother and sister from Arkansas to Los Angeles to live with their grandfather. His best friends are Joaquin Montez and Tony Lee. He enjoys basketball, and works at his grandfather's grill. In the first season, he went out with Tamika, but they broke up by the second season. Jordan's new love interest is Autumn Williams. * Joaquin Osmando Montez (played by Eddy Martin) is the best friend of Jordan Lewis. He is planning a career in politics (just like the rest of his family other than his dad who is a police officer) and does not like to make mistakes because they might end up on his \\"permanent record\\". He is counting on Jordan and his other friends to make him more \\"social\\". * Tony Lee (played by Justin Chon) is Jordan's other best friend, and sometimes rival. They began as rivals on the basketball court, but when Tony took a job at Grandpa's restaurant Jordan and Tony became best friends. Tony and Jordan are constantly competing for girls, especially Autumn, Jordan's new interest. * Tangie Cunningham (played by Raven Goodwin) is Jordan and Monica's cousin and his toughest critic. She is concerned that Jordan's image will have in cool in the big city of L.A. Tangie is obsessed with Tony and one of her main goals is to pass Oprah Winfrey in fame and in wealth. She has a crush on Tony as seen in all of the episodes so far. * Monica Lewis (played by Kristen Combs) is Jordan's 9-year-old sister who has him tracked down 24/7. Jordan doesn't mind his sister and always wants to know what she is doing and how he can help. When Jordan began ignoring her in the episode \\"Air Jordan\\" she asked Tony to take her to school. She has two dolls that look like her called \\"Ponica\\" and \\"Shonica\\". She loves to watch her portable dvd player, and eating chips. Her nickname is Mo-Mo. * Pamela Cunningham-Lewis (played by Shania Accius) is Jordan and Monica's mother who according to him: \\"has eyes in the back of her head\\" She moved her family back to Los Angeles and they are back living in Grandpa's house/restaurant. She is very over-protective of Jordan. * Grant Cunningham (played by Beau Billingslea) is Jordan's, Tangie's, and Monica grandfather and Pamela's father. He has owned the local diner for as long as anyone can remember. He expects discipline and order from everyone (especially Tangie and Jordan). Most people think he can make the best macaroni and cheese in L.A. County. He often falls for Monica and will buy anything for her. * Tamika Newsome (played by Chelsea Harris) (season 1) was Tangie's best friend and a girl that Jordan has a major crush on. She developed a crush on Jordan because he was acting like a thug, but then she realized that she really didn't like bad boys. She went out with Jordan for a while, then broke up with him. Tamika was a nice girl, but she wasn't as interested in Jordan as Jordan was interested in her. She doesn't return in the second season because she moved away. * Autumn Williams (played by Chelsea Tavares) (season 2) Is the new girl in town, Autumn just moved to the neighborhood with her family. She's gorgeous, sweet and down to earth. No one would ever guess that she's the super model next door. Jordan and Autumn love hanging out together and become fast friends.

Goldsborough Bruff; October 2, 1804 ‚Äì April 14, 1889) was an amateur artist and adventurer as well as a professional draftsman and cartographer. He attended West Point for two years before becoming a merchant seaman. He later served as a draftsman for the United States Navy and a mapmaker for the United States Army. In 1849, he formed the Washington City and California Mining Association and led an expedition to California seeking gold. He kept a detailed journal of the expedition that was later published in two volumes. After returning from California, Bruff worked as an architectural designer in the United States Department of the Treasury.  Early life  Bruff was born in the City of Washington, District of Columbia on 2 October 1804. He was the son of Thomas and Mary Bruff. His father was a well-known physician and dentist, who invented and patented several dental equipment items, along with the coffee grinderhttps://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-36-02-0076. He grew up in a large house on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 21st Street in downtown Washington. As a child, Bruff witnessed the British invasion of Washington during the War of 1812.Read, Georgia Willis and Ruth Gaines, \\"J.

In 1820, Bruff was appointed to West Point. However, he was forced to resign after only two years because he was involved in a duel, which was a serious violation of military regulations. After leaving West Point, he signed onto the crew of a merchant ship as a cabin boy. He spent the next five years traveling around the world as an itinerant seaman. This included at least three years as an acting Master's Mate on a United States Navy Ship.  Career  Bruff returned to Washington in 1827. Deciding to give up sea travels, he took a job as a draftsman at the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk, Virginia. He remained in this position with minor promotions until 1837. Feeling that he was underpaid, Bruff took a new drafting job with the United States Army at nearby Fortress Monroe, where he stayed for about two years. Sometime in 1839, Bruff took a new job with the Army's Bureau of Topographical Engineers back in Washington. In this position, he made numerous maps for Army reports that were published and sent to Congress. He made hand-copied duplicates of original field maps delivered to the bureau by Army topographical engineers returning from their journeys in the West. He also engraved maps and drawings for publication. One of his most important projects was to make copies of all of the maps and drawing that were included in Captain John C. Fr√©mont's report to Congress. During the course of his work, Bruff got to know Fr√©mont and many other topographical engineers when they returned from exploring the West. He also made the military maps used in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Bruff remained with the bureau for the next decade.  California expedition  In 1849, the news of gold discoveries in California swept through Washington. This rekindled Bruff's desire for travel and adventure. He organized the Washington City and California Mining Association and planned an expedition to California with the stated purpose of mining gold and conducting trade.Read, Georgia Willis and Ruth Gaines, \\"The Washington City and California Mining Association\\", Gold Rush: The Journals, Drawings, and Other Papers of J. Goldsborough Bruff, Captain, Washington City and California Mining Association, New York: Columbia University Press, 1949, pp. xxxi‚Äìliii. The association had many investors and they financed a well-equipped expedition. Bruff was elected captain of the expedition. While it was an unofficial title, Bruff was called \\"Captain\\" for the rest of his life. Bruff's camp in the Sierra Nevada MountainsAs the leader of the expedition, Bruff purchased fourteen large wagons, mules, tents, armaments, and other supplies for the trek to California. On 2 April 1849, he led the expedition's sixty-six men, all in matching uniforms, in a farewell parade through the streets of Washington. On the way out of the city, Bruff stopped at the White House and met with President Zachary Taylor. During the expedition, Bruff kept extensive journals that recorded the details of the expedition's travels. He also made many drawings of the things he saw along the trail. He recorded his meeting with Colonel Benjamin Bonneville at Fort Kearny. He sketched Fort Laramie in Wyoming and Fort Hall in Idaho along with important geographic features like Chimney Rock in Nebraska. He also made drawings of numerous less important hills, canyon, river crossings, and hot springs. Bruff made many drawings of camp life and recorded grave markers he encountered along the trail.Read, Georgia Willis and Ruth Gaines, Gold Rush: The Journals, Drawings, and Other Papers of J. Goldsborough Bruff, Captain, Washington City and California Mining Association, New York: Columbia University Press, 1949, pp. 21, 28, 37, 93, 103, and 531‚Äì562. The expedition followed the Lassen Trail into California. After arriving in the state, the expedition broke up, leaving Bruff to spend a very difficult winter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. While in California, Bruff got to know Peter Lassen very well. He then traveled around California's gold country, making many drawings of geographic landmarks, mining camps, and other interesting scenes. He left California in June 1851 by sea, arriving in New York City a month later. Some of his luggage was stolen from the dock at New York harbor, but none of his journals or drawings were lost.\\"Joseph Goldsborough Bruff Diaries, Journals, and Notebooks\\", Beinecke Rare Books and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, accessed 24 July 2015.\\"J.

Later life  After returning to Washington, Bruff went to work as a draftsman in the office of the supervising architect in the United States Department of the Treasury. In that position, he designed the ornamentation for the south and west wings of the Treasury building in Washington as well as architectural ornamentation for Treasury offices throughout the country. During his tenure in the office, he served under supervising architects Ammi B. Young, Isaiah Rogers, and Alfred B. Mullett. Bruff did not get along with Mullett and left the office in 1869, transferring to the department's registry office. He returned to the Treasury architect's office in 1876 to serve under his friend James G. Hill. By 1887, Bruff was the oldest employee of the United States Government.\\"Personal and Impersonal\\", Wyandott Herald, Kansas City, Kansas, 10 February 1887, p.1\\"Personal and Impersonal\\", Lawrence Daily Journal, Lawrence, Kansas, 19 February 1887, p. 2. He remained in his Treasury position until he became ill in early 1889. Bruff was an active member of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, which eventually became part of the Smithsonian Institution. He was a member of the National Art Association, serving as the organization's secretary for a time. He was also a member of the Washington Monument Association and a lifelong Mason. In addition, Bruff was a member of the Society of the Oldest Inhabitants of Washington City. As a prominent member of the society, he was selected to give the keynote address at the city's Washington birthday celebration held at the city hall in 1874.\\"Oldest Inhabitants\\", National Republican, Washington, District of Columbia, 21 February 1874, p. 4. That same year, Bruff became a founding member of the Washington Association of Engineers and Architects, a professional organization for architects and building engineers.\\"Local Miscellany\\", National Republican, Washington, District of Columbia, 24 September 1874, p. 4. Bruff was an avid reader. His personal library included 322 volumes covering a wide range of topics including history, travel, many scientific works, philosophy, religion, fine arts, and literature. He also kept a private artifact collection of ancient coins, Native American weapons and tools, geological specimens, animal tusks, original letters from notable Americans, and mementos from historical sites as well as portraits of famous people he admired.Read, Georgia Willis and Ruth Gaines, \\"Foreword\\" (by Dr. Frederick W.

The park includes the Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, formed by damming Bald Eagle Creek and other smaller streams and covering . Bald Eagle State Park is at the meeting point of two distinct geologic features. The Allegheny Plateau is to the north and the Ridge and Valley area of Pennsylvania is to the south. The park is in the Bald Eagle Valley off Pennsylvania Route 150 in Howard, between Milesburg and Lock Haven. History =Lenape= The park is named for the Lenape chief, Woapalanne, meaning bald eagle. Chief Woapalanne lived in the area for a brief period of time during the mid-18th century in a village that was on Bald Eagle Creek Path, part of the much more extensive Great Indian Warpath that stretched from New York into the Carolinas. This path was used by the Iroquois to conduct raids on the Cherokee in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Pennsylvania Route 150 follows this path in some areas near Bald Eagle State Park. =Iron and lumber= Bald Eagle Mountain, which was stripped of old growth timber during the lumber era and is now covered with a second growth forest Bald Eagle Creek is one of the few navigable tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Centre County. This made it a vital part of the transportation network in Centre County's early days. The Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation canal was built from the Pennsylvania Canal at Lock Haven up Bald Eagle Creek and Spring Creek into Bellefonte in 1848. This canal was damaged by flooding in 1867 and went out of service. It was replaced by the Bald Eagle Valley Railroad, which completed its line along the valley in 1865. The availability of transportation and vast natural resources drew the iron industry and later the lumber industry to Bald Eagle Valley. The Eagle Ironworks was built in 1810 by Roland Curtin, an immigrant from Ireland. The ironworks produced iron along Bald Eagle Creek until it was closed in 1922. At first charcoal was used to fire the furnaces. This charcoal was produced locally by colliers who harvested timber from the mountainsides and slowly burned the logs to produce charcoal. Later the furnaces were adapted to use coal, another of Pennsylvania's plentiful natural resources. The demand for lumber products reached the Bald Eagle area in the mid-to-late 19th century. Vast stands of old-growth forest were harvested and sent down the West Branch Susquehanna River to the sawmills at Williamsport. The once abundant stands of pine, oak, hickory, chestnut and hemlock were stripped from the hills and valleys. The land in the valley was converted to farmland and is still farmed today. The forests on Bald Eagle Mountain have since regrown forming an extensive second growth forest. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir Foster Joseph Sayers dam and reservoir Memorial to Foster Joseph Sayers in the park Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is a reservoir that was built in 1971 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of a flood control project on the Susquehanna River basin.

She is currently represented by DC Moore Gallery, New York. Biography Jacquette grew up in Stamford, Connecticuthttp://www.ifpda.org/content/node/1145 and studied at the Rhode Island School of Design. She taught at Moore College of Art and was a visiting artist at the University of Pennsylvania from 1972 to 1976. She taught at Parsons School of Design from 1975 to 1978, and at the University of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1984.http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/monotypes/jacquettebio.html Her three-part mural \\"Autumn Expression\\" (1980) is in the U.S. Post Office in Bangor, Maine. According to the Smithsonian American Art Museum's online bio, Ms. Jacquette has held various academic positions and was also honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1990. In an interview with art critic John Yau in The Brooklyn Rail, Jacquette says of the way she came to begin painting aerial views: She married Rudy Burckhardt. She is a visiting artist at the Siena Art Institute. She lives in New York City.http://www.sharksink.com/artists.asp?artists=21  Work  As noted in The Female Gaze, \\"Jacquette's works begin with direct studies made with pastel on paper or photographs taken from airplanes, skyscrapers, or rented single- engine planes. She often took flights primarily to study cloud formations and aerial perspectives. She has been described as the 'Canaletto of the skies.' Her paintings are intensely colored, elaborately detailed panoramas of cities, and the countryside at various day and night. Unique vies and radical angles draw attention to the act of perception, anthropomorphizing the buildings that occupy her urbanscapes.\\" Awards & Commissions 2009 *Eric Isenbeurger Annual Prize + Samuel F.

It is an analogue of the chemotherapy drug lonidamine, an indazole-carboxylic acid, and further studies continue to be conducted into this family of drugs as possible contraceptives. , adjudin was in phase II human trials. As shown in mature male rats, the agent induces reversible germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium by disrupting cell adhesion function between Sertoli and germ cells. It weakens the adhesion between the Sertoli cell and maturing sperm leading to a sloughing and loss of the latter. As it does not affect spermatogonia themselves the loss of fertility is reversible. In experiments hormonal levels (FSH, LH, testosterone) were undisturbed during administration, and normal spermatogenesis returned in 95% of the tubules of rats at 210 days after the drug had been discontinued. When taken orally, the drug has very low bioavailability. The oral dose effective for contraception is so high that there have been side effects in the muscles and liver. Coupling an Adjudin molecule to a mutant form of follicle-stimulating hormone may solve this problem. The mutant FSH is modified such that it no longer induces Inhibin B production, but the membrane-bound FSH receptors on Sertoli cells still bind to it, delivering the Adjudin directly to the target cells. The adjudin-FSH can be either injected, delivered in an implant, or as a gel.http://malecontraceptives.org/methods/adjudin.php A study in 2013 indicated that Adjudin, similar to its analogue lonidamine, has properties that inhibit cancer growth by targeting mitochondria and blocking energy metabolism in certain kinds of tumor cells in mice, indicating that it has potential as a drug for cancer therapy.

Works In addition to the halachic rulings collected in Piskei Recanati (his only halachic work), Recanati wrote a cabalistic commentary on the Torah, a commentary on the siddur, and discussions of the commandments. Piskei Recanati was first published in Bologna, 1538, and was published several times thereafter. * Perush 'Al ha- Torah (Venice, 1523), a work full of mystical deductions and meanings based upon a textual interpretation of the Bible; it describes many visions and celestial revelations claimed to have been experienced by the author, who was influenced by cabalistic ideas, and expresses the highest respect for all cabalistical authors, even the most recent apocryphal ones. The work was republished with a commentary by Mordecai Jaffe, at Lublin in 1595 and was also translated into Latin by Pico di Mirandola. * Perush ha-Tefillot and ·π¨a'ame ha-Mi·∫ìwot, published together (Constantinople, 1543‚Äì1544; Basel, 1581). Like the preceding work, these are strongly tinctured with German mysticism. Recanati frequently quotes Judah he-Hasid of Regensburg, Eleazar of Worms, and their disciples, and alludes also to the Spanish cabalists, Nahmanides among them. He is rarely original, quoting almost always other authorities. Although Recanati had a high reputation for sanctity, he exercised less influence on his contemporaries than upon posterity. To assist him in his cabalistic researches, he studied logic and philosophy; and he endeavors to support the cabala by philosophical arguments. *Pis·∏≥e Hilkot, Bologna, 1538.

The park is surrounded by Elk State Forest and is mountainous with deep valleys. The park is home to the rarely seen elk and bald eagle. Sinnemahoning State Park is on Pennsylvania Route 872, eight miles (13 km) north of the village of Sinnamahoning. In 1958, the park opened under the direction of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry: it became a Pennsylvania State Park in 1962. History =Native Americans= Native Americans began living in the Sinnemahoning State Park area 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. They followed the receding glaciers and found that the area supported a bountiful supply of fish, wildlife, berries and nuts. Archaeologists have found evidence of their presence in the bottomlands of the creeks. The word Sinnemahoning is derived from an American Indian word that means \\"Rocky Lick\\". A natural salt lick is said to have been near the mouth of Grove Run. =Lumber era= The native population of Pennsylvania was forced out by disease and the American Revolutionary War . The Sinnemahoning area was left largely unsettled and wild until the late 19th century when the logging boom that spread throughout the mountains of Pennsylvania arrived. Lumbermen cleared vast stands of old-growth forest. The logs were floated down Sinnemahoning Creek and its tributaries to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport. The only thing the lumbermen left behind was the treetops. These tree tops were left to dry. The passing steam locomotives on the railroads would ignite this dry brush causing massive wildfires that swept through the mountains and valleys. The Sinnemahoning Creek area was left to waste. The forests struggled to regrow in the wake of the wildfire. The hills began to erode. The streams were dying and wildlife was scarcely found. =George B. Stevenson Reservoir= George B. Stevenson Reservoir is a man made lake that was engineered by Gannett Fleming Corddry & Carpenter, Inc. and constructed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1955 as part of the flood control project on the West Branch Susquehanna River. It is one of four such dams in the river basin. The other reservoirs are at Kettle Creek State Park, Curwensville and Bald Eagle State Park. These four reservoirs and dams control a total of of drainage area and provides flood prevention for the cities and towns downstream. The reservoir is named after the former State Senator of the same name, who while during his tenure as Mayor of Lock Haven, experienced the 1936 flood; subsequently, he remained dedicated to flood control during the rest of his political career. Recreation The reservoir is open to some recreational boating, fishing and ice fishing. Gas powered motors are prohibited on George B. Stevenson Reservoir. Motorized boats must be powered by electric motors only. Sailboats, rowboats, canoes, kayaks, and paddleboats are permitted on the waters of the lake. All boats must be properly registered with any state. Common game fish at the park, in the lake and streams, are brook, rainbow and brown trout, catfish, crappie, tiger muskellunge, smallmouth and largemouth bass, sunfish, bluegill, perch and pickerel. There is a native population of brook trout in some of the small streams of Sinnemahoning State Park. The reservoir is open to ice fishing during the winter months when the lake is frozen. =Hunting= There are of woods open to hunting. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are black bears, eastern gray squirrels, ruffed grouse, waterfowl, white-tailed deer, and turkeys. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Hunters also use the park to gain access to Elk State Forest. =Trails= The trails of Sinnemahoning State Park are open to hiking, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling. * Red Spruce Trail is about one mile (1.6 km) long and goes from the camping area to the Forty Maples Picnic Area. It passes through a spruce plantation and a mixed hardwood forest. Hikers should be cautious of the venomous snakes that live in the area. * Low Lands Trail is a level trail that follows a railbed that was part of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. It passes vernal pools, thick stands of spruce trees, and creek beds. The Low Lands Trail ends at the Wildlife Viewing area. Hikers on the trail may get the chance to see osprey, butterflies, elk, and grassland birds. =Camping and picnicking= The modern campground has 35 sites with a washhouse that is equipped with showers and flush toilets. The camp sites can accommodate tents, campers and RVs. Each site has a picnic table and a fire ring. The Brooks Run Ranger cabin is a two story house available for rent. It sleeps up to twelve people with four bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and a fireplace. Sinnemahoning State Park has three picnic area. =Wildlife Center= The park's visitor center and office opened in 2011 in the northern section of the park. Known as the Wildlife Center at Sinnemahoning, the building features interpretive exhibits and opportunities to view wildlife.

At the beginning of the government's appointment, five policy priorities were identified in the areas of federal accountability, tax reform, crime, child care and health care. Economy During his premiership, Stephen Harper adopted several positions and policies in regard to the economic issues of Canada, including various tax cuts, exemptions and credits as well as discussing the issue of fiscal imbalance among provinces and measures to cope with more troubled sectors of the Canadian economy. He also promoted public- private partnerships for infrastructure spendings. Environment Stephen Harper visited Vancouver Island University's Deep Bay Marine Field Station in 2010 Harper and the Conservative government criticized the Kyoto Accord on measures to fight against global warming, saying that the economy would be crippled if Canada was forced to meet the Accord's timetable to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Harper considered the objectives implemented by Canada to meet its goals unrealistic despite Canada signing the protocol in 2002. The government's Clean Air Act was presented on October 19, 2006. Its main focus was to reduce greenhouse emissions to about 45-65% of the 2003 levels. The goal was set for the year 2050 with a decrease of greenhouse emissions starting in 2020. There were also regulations set for vehicle fuel consumption for 2011, while new measures would be set for industries starting in 2010. while oil companies would be forced to reduce emissions for each barrel produced. Additional targets and measures were introduced by Environment Minister John Baird in 2007 including fuel-efficient standards in which auto industries would comply. One of the plans also mentioned that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, will have to reduce green-house emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 and will have to report data on their emissions every year, on May 31. In the 2007 Throne Speech, the government officially abandoned the Kyoto objectives in favor of their previous policies and accords with Asian and Pacific countries in which Harper joined the US-led Asia- Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. On September 24, 2007, the United States, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia, several among them being the biggest polluters. Critics including the World Wildlife Fund said that the greenhouse emissions in 2020 will still be higher than the 1990 levels, while Canada will not meet Kyoto targets before 2025, 13 years after its objectives. High-profile figures including David Suzuki and Former US Vice-President Al Gore also criticized the plan as being insufficient. Opposition members led by Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez tabled bill C-288, which would force the government to respect the measures of the Kyoto Accord and forced it to present its measures within 60 days. The bill passed third reading on February 14, 2007, 161-113 but the government said that it would not comply. The Harper government also has drawn sharp international criticism for its stance on asbestos which is heavily mined in Quebec. In 2011, Canada continued to oppose adding the chrysotile form of asbestos to the Rotterdam Convention, a treaty that would require exports of chrysotile to developing countries to contain warnings of carcinogenicity.Canada refuses to allow chrysotile to be added to Rotterdam Convention in 2011 Agriculture =Aid for farmers= In 2006, farmers demanded substantial aid from the federal government to be able to cope with a 2005 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that abolished subsidies and other trade barriers in the agriculture industry before 2013. The farmers, especially from the Ottawa region drove their tractors to Parliament Hill, as well as oil and food terminals across Ottawa and in front of the Prime Minister's residence to voice their concerns. In the 2006 budget, the Conservatives announced an immediate $1.5 billion aid to farmers for the Grains and Oilseeds Payment Program. Agriculture Minister Chuck Strahl also announced in July $550 million in aid to low-income farmers with a two-year pilot project On March 9, 2007, the government announced $1 billion in funding for farmers that would include payments to ease effects of high production costs and for various income programs. =Wheat Board= Strahl also planned to review the roles of the Canadian Wheat Board, a monopoly in the Canadian wheat industry. He wanted to end the \\"single desk\\" system which causes the monopoly, despite the opposition of farmers which supported the current role of the Board. Social policy =Age of consent= The Conservative government raised the legal age of consent to 16 years. Justice minister Vic Toews proposed the bill in order to protect youth against sexual predators. The Tackling Violent Crime Act took effect on 1 May 2008, making the current age of consent 16. A close in age exemption allows teenagers aged 14 and 15 to engage in sexual acts with partners who are less than 5 years older than them. Before this law, the age of consent was 14 (it had been set at 14 in 1890, before that date it was 12). =Same-sex marriage= During the 2006 election campaign, Stephen Harper promised a free vote to revisit the issue of same-sex marriage which had been legalized in 2005 by the previous government. The vote took place on December 7, 2006: the government bill to change the status quo was rejected 175-123. Afterwards Harper told the media that he now considered the issue to be closed and that he would not pursue further legislation on the matter. There were also plans to pass a law that would protect \\"freedom of religious expression\\", a law interpreted by some as a shield for opponents of same-sex marriage. The government cut funding to various social programs and festivals, some of which were related to the gay community such as Montreal's Black and Blue Festival, one of the biggest gay festivals in Canada. The Harper government also reduced spending for women's advocacy work on the status of women in the country. =Child-care policy= In the 2006 budget, the Tories introduced a new child care allowance that gives parents with children under six years of age an allowance of $1200 per year, which is taxable in the hands of the lower income parent. The allowance is not tied to actual child care expenses, and is available to all parents, regardless of whether or not they use childcare services. The measures have cost the government about $3.7 billion per year. This plan replaced the Liberal government's plan announced in the 2005 budget under Paul Martin who committed $5 billion over five years to enhance and expand early learning and child care in collaboration with provinces and territories. After March 2007, the newly elected Conservatives under Stephen Harper eliminated the bilateral agreements as their first act of power. The child care plan agreements were based on Quebec's universal child care model and had been signed under Paul Martin's Liberal government with several provinces in 2005. The plan was cancelled when they took office and was replaced by the Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) $100-a-month cheques for parents with young children with promised tax credits for private or profit care and up to $250 million annually to create child care spaces across the country. This measure was met with opposition by the child care sector and national child care not-for-profit organizations as well as the provincial counterparts including Ontario's Dalton McGuinty and Quebec's Premier Jean Charest. They claimed that it would not create additional daycare places which Minister Diane Finley promised. Quebec officials also cited that it will harm provincial revenues and deteriorate fiscal equality. Other opponents mentioned that the spending was not adequate and did not address the need for child care spaces, particularly in urban centers. Supporters argued that the Liberal program the Tories replaced was inflexible and discriminated against stay-at- home parents. Harper has stated that his government will work with provincial and local governments, not-for-profit organizations, and employers to create additional spaces, and has set aside $250 million per year to fund these initiatives. In September 2006, Minister Diane Finley, announced the creation of a Ministerial Advisory Committee on the Government of Canada's Child Care Spaces Initiative that would provide advice on the approach and mechanisms needed to create child care spaces and allocate the $250 million promised. Contrary to the recommendations of the report, to increase the supply of quality child care spaces and make child care more affordable for working parents, the Conservatives redirected the $250 million a year it had set aside for the Community Child Care Investment Program to provincial and territorial governments. And while Harper stated, that his government will work with provincial and local governments, not-for-profit organizations, and employers to create additional spaces, key national child care organizations such as the Canadian Child Care Federation, show no funding or program activity in their annual reports from federal departments. Since 2008, child care and early childhood development non-profits such as Invest in Kids, the Council for Early Childhood Development and Child Care Human Resources Sector Council have all closed doors after decades of operation. =Poverty and homelessness= On December 19, 2006, the government announced $526 million of funding to tackle poverty and homelessness in Canada with $270 million for the Homelessness Partnering Strategy and $246 million for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It will provide funding for refurbishing and renovating low- income homes, as well as improving access for homeless people to various services and supports such as health and substance abuse treatment programs. Prior to the announcement, activists protested at Human Resources and Social Services Minister Diane Finley's offices in Ottawa. The federal government's Homelessness Partnering Strategy implements the resoundingly successful Housing First projects undertaken across Canada. =Aboriginals= The Conservative Party tabled about $9 billion for aboriginals in 2006-07 but with few measures announced in the 2007 budget. On March 22, 2007, a private bill was tabled in the House of Commons demanding an additional $5.1 billion for First Nations health, education and housing. The motion was adopted 176 to 126 with mainly Conservative members voting against. Indian Affairs Minister Jim Prentice mentioned that it will ignore the motion that would have forced the government to implement measures in order to respect the Kelowna Accord which was concluded by the Liberals in 2005 prior to the 2006 elections and supported by former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The Accord was supposed to give First Nations better health care, education and housing, but it lacked specific implementation details. In the 2008 budget, $330 million was announced for improving access to safe drinking water in First Nations Reserves with funding for economic improvement, services and health programs. On June 11, 2008, Harper made a speech at the House of Commons in which he issued an official apology to the First Nation groups in regard to a residential school abuse in which children were isolated from their homes, families and cultures for a century. Opposition leaders also issued apologies. Harper admitted the responsibility of the wrongdoing of the government: \\"The Government of Canada now recognizes it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes... to separate children from rich and vibrant traditions\\" =Veterans= The Conservatives' 2007 budget included $19 million to introduce an ombudsman's office and Veterans' Bill of Rights.Mike Blanchfield, \\"Little thrown at military front: Spending as promised, new ombudsman office,\\" Edmonton Journal, March 20, 2007, pg. A.5. In April 2007, Harper and Minister of Veterans Affairs Greg Thompson told the press in Kitchener, Ontario that the bill of rights would come into effect soon. $282 million were announced in the 2008 budget to support war veterans. The CPC, under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, has incrementally increased the annual budget of Veterans Affairs Canada from $2.8 billion in 2006 to $3.64 billion over an 8-year period. =Apology to Chinese-Canadians= On June 23, 2006, Stephen Harper offered full apology to Chinese Canadians for the country's treatment of Chinese immigrants during the years 1885 to 1923 on the imposing Head Tax policy to them, and subsequent discrimination policies, including subsequent exclusion of Chinese immigrants from 1923 until 1947. It is estimated about 82,000 Chinese paid the fee, first set at $50 and later raised to $500, about two years' wages at the time. For many years, the federal government refused to apologize, citing the possibilities of legal liabilities. Near the end of 2005, the outgoing Liberal government offered to pay $12.5 million for the creation of a new non-profit foundation to educate Canadians about anti-Chinese discrimination, though no money would go to individuals who had paid the tax, and the grant was on the pre-condition of \\"no apology\\" by the government. It was met with controversy, as the Liberals had not consulted many of the major Canadian-Chinese groups (despite claiming to), and as the promised amount was reduced to $2.5 million. Midway through the election campaign, Paul Martin offered an apology on radio but not in Parliament. Harper said that Chinese-Canadians who paid the tax or their surviving spouses will receive a symbolic $20,000 ex-gratia payment. =Consumer product safety= Following a series of products consumer due to safety and health concerns in 2007, the government adopted a series of measures to enhance and improve consumer product safety laws. In the new Canada Consumer Product Safety Act as well as amendments to the Food and Drug Act, measures included developing tighter manufacturing standards, mandatory reports by industries on any injuries, deaths or other problems on various products as well as more authority by the government to mandate recalls on various products. The government also announced higher fines for industries failing to the new laws as well as the increase number of inspections and inspectors. =Bill C-69= In late-February 2008, the government announced its intention on amending the Income Tax Act which would suspend any tax credits to any film or television production which would include content judging too offensive to the general public. The Canadian Family Action Coalition had pushed the federal government for the funding cuts and is supported by the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party citing that governments should be careful about putting taxpayers money for movies with too much sexual content. The bill was met with opposition by the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists citing it has grave implication to the actors while calling it morally offensive to modern Canadian society. Canadian Actress Sarah Polley, added that the bill would amount to \\"censorship\\" and that the definition of offensive is \\"extremely vague and dangerous to be using\\". MP Jim Abbott cited that \\"the bill does nothing to obstruct filmmakers ‚Äì it just stops the government from footing bills for films that don't fall in line with Canadians' morals\\". Similar legislation was unanimously passed in 2003. Director Ang Lee has also spoken out on bill C-10. He stated that \\"People should be free to say anything,\\" though he himself has never been censored even under the Chinese film boards strict review process. =Immigration= In March 2008 as part of the annual budget, the government introduced several laws to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The changes would have helped to streamline immigrant application back-up, to speed up application for skilled workers and to rapidly reject other ones that are judged not admissible by immigration officers. Immigrant applications had risen to a high of 500,000, creating a delay of up to six months for an application to be processed. The bill also provided more power to the Minister to set limits on the types of immigrants that can have their application processed. The government added that the reforms would have provided more skilled workers to the country. The opposition members criticized the measures because it would shut the door on immigrants while giving the Minister too much power to decide on who can enter Canada and others not. Trinity‚ÄîSpadina MP Olivia Chow had proposed an amendment to remove the measures as part of the budget. Immigration Minister Diane Finley stated that the current government helped process applications 20 to 40 percent faster than before the measures were announced. In 2011, Canada admitted a record-high number of immigrants last year, with more than 280,600 new permanent residents. That's the highest number admitted into the country in 57 years.https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2011/02/13/canada_admits_recordhigh_number_of_immigrants.html =Bill C-70= In early 2008, Conservative MP Ken Epp tabled private member's bill C-484 in which harming a fetus would constitute a crime. Opponents of the bill, including medical specialists in Quebec, alleged that the bill would open the door for an abortion ban. The bill passed first reading in March 2008 with the support of the opposition. However, Harper has indicated that he did not wish to re-open the abortion debate. =Official languages= In June 2008, Jos√©e Verner (then the Minister responsible for Official Languages) announced that the government would invest about $1.1 billion until 2013 to promote the official languages in the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality 2008-2013. The plan was to facilitate cultural minority groups, most notably in education and health. Part of the plan comprised recommendations made by former New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord in a report on the state of official languages in Canada. The government also announced the support program for official languages which replaced an older judiciary program. The programme was followed by the Roadmap for Canada's Official Languages 2013-2018: Education, Immigration, Communities. =Arts and Culture cuts= Prior to the start of the 2008 election campaign, Minister Josee Verner announced $45 million in cutbacks to arts and cultural programs. Harper explained that ordinary Canadians cannot relate to \\"rich galas\\" where artists complain about their subsidies. He also noted that the overall budget of Canadian Heritage has climbed eight per cent.\\" Many actors across the country had criticized the move citing that the arts and culture industries represent over 1.1 million jobs in Canada and contributes to about $86 billion to its gross domestic product. The Conservatives only elected 10 MPs in Quebec where the opposition against the cuts was the most imposing. It also prevented them from winning a majority government for the second straight election. James Moore who replaced Verner as Heritage Minister following the election stated that he had no plans to cancel the cutbacks citing the decisions made were in the past but added that there will be opportunities in the future to view the spending. Interior security :For border security measures, see Foreign policy of the Harper government =Transit security= On November 14, 2006, Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon announced an immediate $37 million investment on improving security in public transit systems across the country. Cannon said that transit systems are not immune to terrorist attacks like those that hit Madrid, London and Mumbai over the past two years. Toronto and Montreal received $11 million each, Ottawa $1.2 million while Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary also received a certain amount. The money will be used for security plans, public awarenesses and training. The Toronto Transit Commission and OC Transpo requested that the money would be spent on installing cameras inside buses. Subsequently, it was revealed that while 40% of all transit users in Canada use the TTC, and 85% of Toronto transit riders use the TTC, it will only receive $1.46 million, with the remaining grant used for GO Transit and Union Station. =Crime policy= The government promised to be tough on crime by imposing tougher sentences to people committing firearm offenses and violent crimes; a promise made by Harper after a record number of deaths by gun-related incidents in Toronto in 2005. They are also on the process of creating a new law that would impose tougher sentences for repeat crime offenders, eliminating house arrest or conditional sentences of offenders and a legislation targeting impaired drivers and street racing. Several anti-crime bills were progressing in the House but failed to pass the Senate as a new Throne Speech was announced for October 2007 in which several of the measures were re-announced. The new bill, called the Tackling Violent Crime Act (or Bill C-2), consisted of five bills many of them from cancelled legislations and included measures the age of consent, repeat and violent offenders. A confidence motion on the bill was tabled and passed the House 172-27 on February 12, 2008 as all Liberal MPs abstained from voting. The motion is set to presented at the Senate in March 2008 On October 4, 2007, the government announced a new national drug plan, that would include mandatory jail sentences for drug trafficking offenses. In addition, the government announced funding for treatment and prevention, including a Prevention Campaign Program for youth. The government pledged about $64 million to fund the drug plan, and characterized the new policy as a balance between prevention and punishment. In 2006, the Conservatives had annulled a bill introduced by the Liberals which would have decriminalized possession of small amounts of cannabis. Cannabis-related arrests have increased significantly since. In the 2008 budget, the government announced $400 million to help set up a Recruitment Fund in which it will help all provinces and territories to hire as much 2 500 police officers while additional funding was announced for jails. On April 14, 2008 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the government introduced new legislatures in regards to car theft. The news laws would make it illegal to tamper with vehicle identification numbers, would target organized group specialized in car and parts theft, chop shops and stolen property trafficking. According to the government, auto thefts are costing about $1.6 billion to Canadians. The city of Winnipeg has the highest number of cars stolen per population. On February 26, 2009, the government announced in Vancouver, a new anti-gang legislation that would make gang-killing a first degree murder offense with mandatory minimum sentences for drive-by shootings of 4 years in prison except for 5 years if committed on behalf of a gang organization. In the weeks prior to the new bill, there were 18 shootings related to a gang war in the Greater Vancouver Area. Stiffer sentences of at least 14 years in jail for aggravated assault and assault with a weapon against a police officer were also announced. The following day, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson also announced minimum mandatory sentences for drug dealers and traffickers. According to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, one-year sentences would be given for marijuana drug dealing linked to organized crime, two-year sentences for hard drugs trafficking as well as a maximum of 14 years in prison for big pot grow- ups. Ironically, despite Stephen Harper's opposition to marijuana culture, in his last 3 years there has been more marijuana produced than any other time in Canada's history. =Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act= The House of Commons defeated a motion 159-124 to extend two provisions of the Canadian Anti- Terrorism Act on February 28, 2007. The two provisions were created five years ago after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, but opposition parties criticized them as a violation of civil liberties. Those in favor of renewal argued that not renewing the provisions would compromise the security of Canadians. The two provisions expired on March 1, 2007 =Gun registry= Since in power, the Conservatives had announced their intentions of significantly reforming or even abolishing the gun registry program implemented in 1995 citing the cost overruns of hundreds of million of dollars while the Tories also criticized the effectiveness of the registry to track every gun as well as being a nuisance for firearm owners. He added that: \\"Duck-hunters, farmers and law-abiding gun owners do not pose a threat to Canadians, criminals do\\". A report conducted by Auditor General Sheila Fraser estimated the costs at nearly $1 billion for the first 10 years of its implementation. On June 19, 2006, the Conservatives introduced the bill to eliminate the program though it did not pass the House vote. It was re- introduced on November 16, 2007 but the motion failed again. On April 1, 2009, the Conservatives had planned to re-introduced again the legislation but in the Senate. While not succeeding in abolishing the program, the government did reform part of the registry. Among the changes made by the Conservatives to the registry, it eliminated within the scope of the registry long guns such as rifles and shotguns, a move that expected to affect up to 320,000 people. It also waived some license fees and extended registry deadlines for long gun owners. Ontario's Attorney General Michael Bryant had criticized the amnesty move in 2007 accusing Ottawa of being \\"in the holster of the gun lobby. By 2008, the federal government had refunded up to $21 million in license fees to 340 000 gun owners. Supporters of keeping the gun registry cited that better gun controls would prevent events such as the Dawson College shooting in 2006 and the Ecole Polytechnique massacre in 1989. One of the victims of the Dawson shooting also challenged Harper for a debate on gun control. Among the groups opposed to the Conservatives plan included the Canadian Auto Workers and the Quebec Women's Federation. A study from Swiss research group, Graduate Institute of International Studies, also cited, in a report called Small Arms Survey 2006, that maintaining the gun registry was more cost effective saving Canada up to $1.4 billion a year in costs associated with gun violence while citing a sharp decrease in the number of gun deaths and injuries. During the 41st Parliament the newly formed Conservative majority government again introduced legislation to repeal the requirement to register non-restricted firearms and to destroy the registry database. Bill C-19 passed both the House and Senate and received royal assent on April 5, 2012. Health policy For the policy on AIDS see Foreign Policy of the Harper government =Patient Wait Times Guarantee= The conservative government promised to introduce a \\"Patient Wait Times Guarantee\\" in conjunction with the provinces. Harper has recently been criticized by prominent media figures, such as Paul Wells, for downplaying this fifth and final priority. On January 11, 2007, Harper announced a $2.6 million pilot project involving a network of 16 pediatric hospitals across the nation. The plan is to monitor wait times in various children's hospitals and in the long range, surgery wait times. Similar existing measures have been implemented in the past by several provincial governments. Critics mentioned that the federal government had interfered in provincial jurisdictions while Ontario's Intergovermental Affairs Minister Marie Bountrogianni cited the deal as a \\"photo-op\\" and an insignificant contribution to the health system. Previously, on January 5, 2007, the government also launched a similar pilot project worth $3.7 million for guaranteed wait times for aboriginal people from First Nations reserves in Manitoba who have \\"diabetes related-foot ulcers and possible amputations\\" On April 4, 2007, a deal between Ottawa and the 13 provinces and territories was concluded in which guaranteed wait times will be implemented country-wide by two measures including funding for provinces to reach the goal. $612 million were given to the provinces during the 2007 federal budget. Health information and communication technologies were part of the second measure which included the participation of a non-profit organization, the Canada Health Infoway which will improve medical information notably for doctors. =Canadian Partnership Against Cancer= On November 24, 2006, Harper announced the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, a 5-year $260 million national plan on battling different types of cancer. This not-for-profit organization will be monitored and evaluated by Health Canada. Prior to that announcement on October 23, Health Minister Tony Clement also launched an 8.4 million dollar heart health strategy that plans to tackle the issue of heart diseases and other related issues. =Toxic chemicals= On December 8, 2006, the government announced plan to crack down on the usage of toxic chemicals. The plan is worth an estimated $300 million over four years and would either eliminate, control or reduce some of the more hazardous toxic chemicals in order to protect the environment and the health and safety of Canadians, particularly in workplaces, as well as animals. The plan is a follow-up to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act that had previously named and targeted a series of dangerous substances. =Tainted blood scandal= On December 15, 2006, the government announced that it will officially compensate victims of a tainted blood scandal in which thousands of people were affected by Hepatitis C (during blood transfusions) before 1986 and after 1990. Those affected between 1986 and 1990 had already received the compensation in 1998. The amount of this deal was estimated at about $1 billion. Education Harper appearing at a gala to celebrate the discovery of , one of two ships wrecked during John Franklin's lost expedition, at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto During the 2008 federal budget, the government announced the creation of a new $350 million Student Grant Program for post-secondary students. The plan replaced the Millennium Scholarship Fund introduced in the late 1990s. Additional funding was announced for improvement other programs such as Canadian Student Loan Program. The Federal Accountability Act On April 11, 2006, President of the Treasury Board John Baird, on behalf of the Canadian government, tabled the Federal Accountability Act and Action Plan. The plan will reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; providing protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the Auditor General to follow the money spent by the government. While the government hopes to have this act passed before the House of Commons breaks for the summer, questions have arisen surrounding elements of the Federal Accountability Act and how it might affect the 2006 Liberal leadership convention. A $1,000 donation limit has been proposed as part of the Federal Accountability Act with political party convention donations being tied to this amount. The Liberal Party of Canada's leadership convention scheduled for December 2006 contains a $995 convention fee, which under the proposed Accountability Act could prevent convention delegates from donating anything beyond their convention fee or prevent the delegate's presence at the convention should their convention fee in conjunction with any donations prior to the convention put them above the donation limit. Some of the Senate majority-holding Liberal Senators have threatened to stall the Federal Accountability Act in the upper chamber until after December because of the effect the proposed donation limits may have on political party conventions. On March 13, 2008, Justice John Gomery, who had led the commission into the federal sponsorship scandal, told the government operations Committee that most of the recommendations he made in his report were still not implemented. He added that the prime minister's office was \\"developing a dangerous concentration of power\\" and that certain members such as non-elected officials are gaining more power while less-known MPs have little influence. He cited that the government's Federal Accountability Act was drafted well before its report and was short of what was required. National unity After sidestepping the political landmine for most of his first year in office, much as all of the post-Charlottetown Accord Prime Ministers had done, Harper reopened the debate on November 22, 2006, by introducing a motion in the House of Commons to recognize \\"the Qu√©b√©cois\\" as a \\"nation within Canada.\\" His hand was forced after the opposition Bloc Qu√©b√©cois were to introduce a motion that called for recognition of Quebec as a \\"nation\\", but not within Canada. The Bloc later modified partly his motion and later decided to support the Conservative motion, which was greeted by Parti Qu√©b√©cois Leader Andre Boisclair and by Quebec Premier Minister Jean Charest. However, Intergovermental Minister Michael Chong said he didn't want the country's unity to be compromised and divided. He resigned his Cabinet position on November 27 over the matter, ahead of a vote on the motion which passed first reading in the House of Commons 266 to 16. It also rejected a Bloc Qu√©b√©cois amendment that did not have mention of Canada. Parliamentary reform =Election dates= In 2007, parliament passed the government's bill that would set election dates on the third Monday in October of the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election, thereby reducing the maximum life of a parliament from the time set by the Constitution Act, 1867. The amendment to the Canada Elections Act, however, did not touch the governor general's prerogative to dissolve parliament or call elections, as such is a constitutional matter. Thus, the prime minister may advise such a move whenever he or she feels is prudent. The first election after the amendment was implemented occurred earlier than the date prescribed by the act; Harper argued that he had to advise an election be called because the minority parliament had become dysfunctional. =Senate reform= During the 2006 election, Harper had promised that he would push for a major reform in the Senate of Canada, one of the main objectives of the former Reform Party, promising that senators would be elected. On December 13, 2006, Harper introduced a bill that would \\"bring democracy\\" to the Senate and, on September 7, 2006, he became the first Canadian prime minister to appear before a Senate committee and was present to make his government's case for Senate reform. Critics, though, believed that it would require an amendment to the constitution. With one notable exception, he, as prime minister, refused to advise any appointments to the Senate pending such reforms. This resulted in 16 Senate vacancies by the time the Conservative Party won a minority in the October 2008 election. The one notable exception was Michael Fortier: When Harper first took office, he resorted to the appointment of Michael Fortier to both the Senate and the Cabinet, arguing the government needed representation for the city of Montreal., CTV News, February 7, 2006 Although this is not without precedence in the Westminster system, this led to many criticisms given the Reform Party's position supporting an elected Senate. In 2008, Fortier gave up his Senate seat and sought election as a Member of Parliament, but, was, in the words of Canadian Press, \\"trounced.\\" Upon re-election in 2008, Harper named Senate reform again as a priority. On December 11, 2008, it was reported that Harper would advise all 18 Senate vacancies be filled with Conservative Party affiliates. This was to prevent a possible coalition government from filling those seats, which, at the time, seemed imminent. The reports were confirmed on December 22, 2008 that Harper had filled all of the senate vacancies with Conservatives. On August 27, 2009, Harper again directed the Governor General to fill Senate vacancies with nine more Conservative senators; Harper claimed that the Senate could not function properly with the vacancies and the new senators would help the Conservative Party's legislation pass more easily. On November 5, 2007, Harper supported a motion made by the NDP to organize a referendum that would decide the fate of the Senate, including the possibility of abolishing it, as Jack Layton described it as \\"outdated institution that has no place in a modern democracy\\". However, experts said that the NDP-Conservative plan would likely fail, with a historian indicating that it would be impossible to pass the motion with a Liberal-majority Senate, and to have an amendment to the constitution accepted by the majority of the provinces. Supreme Court appointments Aside from his legislative agenda, Harper put forward Marshall Rothstein to Governor General Micha√´lle Jean for appointment as the new Puisne Justice to the Supreme Court of Canada, on February 23, 2006. Rothstein had been 'short listed' with two other potential judges by a committee convened by the previous Liberal government. In keeping with election promises of a new appointment process, Harper announced Rothstein had to appear before an 'ad hoc' non-partisan committee of 12 Members of Parliament. However, the committee did not have the power to veto the appointment, which was what some members of his own party had called for.Globe and Mail 20 February 2006. Other The Canadian government reinstituted a policy of lowering the national flag at military installations such as Department of National Defence headquarters only, drawing criticism that the government was showing a lack of respect for the soldiers although veterans groups such as the Royal Canadian Legion support this policy.

He was rabbi first in Cologne and Worms, and then moved to Frankfort-on-the-Main. He authored Sefer HaAguddah (◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊ê◊í◊ï◊ì◊î, \\"Book of the Collection\\"), a halakhic work (structured by the order of the Talmud's tractates) which was highly regarded by later rabbinic authorities. He was killed in the Erfurt massacre of 1349 during the Black Death era massacres of hundreds of Jewish communities throughout Europe.  Aguddah  Suslin authored the book Aguddah (◊ê◊í◊ï◊ì◊î \\"Collection\\").Aggudah Hebrew print edition In concise fashion it enumerates the most important legal decisions, based on Talmudic law, made by preceding rabbinical authorities. Its purpose is to render such decisions accessible for guidance in their practical application. A comparison of the Aguddah with Jacob ben Asher's Arba'ah Turim, written at the same time in Spain, reveals the deficiencies of the German Jews of that day in matters of method and systematization. While Jacob ben Asher, despite his having partially discarded Maimonides' order and method, exhibited in his Yad HaHazaka, presents a comparatively concise compendium of the laws in use, the Aguddah shows a conglomeration of legal enactments and personal comments on the Talmud ‚Äì in which much foreign matter is interspersed. Among the German Jews, however, the Aguddah received a cordial welcome, while Sephardic Jews have almost absolutely ignored it. Such authorities of the beginning of the fifteenth century as Jacob M√∂lln (Maharil) and Jacob Weil considered Suslin's judgments to be decisive. Its reputation is also shown by the fact that extracts from the same were made a hundred years later (Hanau, 1610), under the title of ·∏§iddushe Aguddah (\\"Novell√¶ from the Aguddah\\"), comprising a selection from Suslin's own explanations in the Aguddah.  Downplaying the modern scholar  Characteristic of the author, his work, and the period in which he lived is his decisionUpon Chullin i. 32 that talmidei chachamim of his era cannot claim the rights and privileges of the class thus named in the Talmud, because nowadays there is no longer any true talmidei chachamim. Suslin evidently acknowledged by this the inferiority of Talmudic learning in his time, and was conscious of his own inferiority.  References  * M.

Built in 1977, it is the largest exhibition center in Latin America. Notable events =1981 May Day attack= On April 30, 1981, during a May Day music concert, Riocentro was the target of a terrorist attack by hardliner members of the Brazilian military dictatorship (1964-1985). Sergeant Guilherme Pereira do Ros√°rio and then-Captain Wilson Dias Machado, nowadays a Colonel, were responsible for detonating two bombs at the venue. Around 9 p.m., however, one of the bombs exploded in the lap of Sergeant Ros√°rio, killing him and seriously wounding Machado. A second bomb exploded a few miles away at a powerhouse responsible for providing electrical energy to Riocentro; it was thrown over the fence and exploded on the ground, and the electric power supply was never interrupted that evening. The government immediately blamed left-wing radicals for the attack. This theory had no support at the time of the event and nowadays there is strong evidence that the attack was planned by the hardline sector of the government to convince the moderate sector that the left-wing urban guerrilla was still active and that a new wave of political repression was required. This episode marked the decline of the military regime in Brazil, which would officially end four years later. =Earth Summit= In 1992, Riocentro hosted the United Nations Earth Summit. =Sports events= In 2007, Riocentro hosted a variety of events for the Pan American Games in several pavilions. Capacity of the pavilions ranges from 2,000 people to 4,500 people. When Rio was bidding for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics which it won in October 2009, four of its six pavilions were proposed as venues. During these games, Pavilion 2 hosted the Olympic boxing competitions, Pavilion 3 hosted the Olympic and Paralympic table tennis competitions, Pavilion 4 hosted the badminton competitions, and Pavilion 6 hosted the Olympic weightlifting and Paralympic powerlifting events.

The report discusses the effect of global warming on the world economy. Although not the first economic report on climate change, it is significant as the largest and most widely known and discussed report of its kind. The Review states that climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen, presenting a unique challenge for economics. The Review provides prescriptions including environmental taxes to minimise the economic and social disruptions. The Stern Review's main conclusion is that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change far outweigh the costs of not acting. The Review points to the potential impacts of climate change on water resources, food production, health, and the environment. According to the Review, without action, the overall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever. Including a wider range of risks and impacts could increase this to 20% of GDP or more, also indefinitely. Stern believes that 5‚Äì6 degrees of temperature increase is \\"a real possibility.\\" The Review proposes that one percent of global GDP per annum is required to be invested to avoid the worst effects of climate change. In June 2008, Stern increased the estimate for the annual cost of achieving stabilisation between 500 and 550 ppm CO2e to 2% of GDP to account for faster than expected climate change. There has been a mixed reaction to the Stern Review from economists. Several economists have been critical of the Review, for example, a paper by Byatt et al. (2006) describes the Review as \\"deeply flawed\\". Some economists (such as Brad DeLong and John Quiggin) have supported the Review. Others have criticised aspects of Review's analysis, but argued that some of its conclusions might still be justified based on other grounds, e.g., see papers by Martin Weitzman (2007) and Dieter Helm (2008). Summary of the Review's main conclusions The executive summary states: *The benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweigh the costs. *The scientific evidence points to increasing risks of serious, irreversible impacts from climate change associated with business-as-usual (BAU) paths for emissions. *Climate change threatens the basic elements of life for people around the world ‚Äì access to water, food production, health, and use of land and the environment. *The impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed ‚Äì the poorest countries and people will suffer earliest and most. And if and when the damages appear it will be too late to reverse the process. Thus we are forced to look a long way ahead. * Climate change may initially have small positive effects for a few developed countries, but it is likely to be very damaging for the much higher temperature increases expected by mid-to-late century under BAU scenarios. *Integrated assessment modelling provides a tool for estimating the total impact on the economy; our estimates suggest that this is likely to be higher than previously suggested. *Emissions have been, and continue to be, driven by economic growth; yet stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere is feasible and consistent with continued growth. *'Central estimates of the annual costs of achieving stabilisation between 500 and 550ppm CO2e are around 1% of global GDP, if we start to take strong action now. [...] It would already be very difficult and costly to aim to stabilise at 450ppm CO2e. If we delay, the opportunity to stabilise at 500-550ppm CO2e may slip away.' *The transition to a low-carbon economy will bring challenges for competitiveness but also opportunities for growth. Policies to support the development of a range of low-carbon and high- efficiency technologies are required urgently. *Establishing a carbon price, through tax, trading or regulation, is an essential foundation for climate change policy. Creating a broadly similar carbon price signal around the world, and using carbon finance to accelerate action in developing countries, are urgent priorities for international co-operation. *Adaptation policy is crucial for dealing with the unavoidable impacts of climate change, but it has been under-emphasised in many countries. *An effective response to climate change will depend on creating the conditions for international collective action. *There is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change if strong collective action starts now. Background On 19 July 2005 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown announced that he had asked Sir Nicholas Stern to lead a major review of the economics of climate change, to understand more comprehensively the nature of the economic challenges and how they can be met, in the UK and globally. The Stern Review was prepared by a team of economists at HM Treasury; independent academics were involved as consultants only. The scientific content of the Review was reviewed by experts from the Walker Institute. The Stern review was not released for regular peer- review, since the UK Government doesn't undertake peer review on commissioned reviews. Papers were published and presentations held, that outlined the approach in the months preceding the release. Positive critical response The Stern Review attracted positive attention from several sectors. Pia Hansen, a European Commission Spokeswoman, said doing nothing is not an option, \\"we must act now\\". Simon Retallack of the UK think tank IPPR said \\"This [Review] removes the last refuge of the \\"do-nothing\\" approach on climate change, particularly in the US.\\" Tom Delay of The Carbon Trust said \\"The Review offers a huge business opportunity.\\" Richard Lambert, Director General of the Confederation of British Industry, said that a global system of carbon trading is \\"urgently needed\\". Charlie Kronick of Greenpeace said \\"Now the government must act and, among other things, invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation.\\" Asset managers F&C; look to the business opportunities and say \\"this is an unprecedented opportunity to generate real value for our clients\\". Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, was optimistic about the opportunities for industry to meet demands created by investment in technology to combat climate change. The Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, formed by 14 of UK's leading companies shared this hope. Chairman of Shell UK, James Smith, expressed the hope of the group that business and Government would discuss how Britain could obtain \\"first mover advantage\\" in what he described as \\"massive new global market\\". On 1 November 2006, then Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, responded by announcing that A$60 million would be allotted to projects to help cut greenhouse gas emissionshttp://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20682039-421,00.html while reiterating that Australia would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Much of this funding was directed at the non-renewable coal industry. British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, stated that the Review demonstrated that scientific evidence of global warming was \\"overwhelming\\" and its consequences \\"disastrous\\" if the world failed to act. The UK Treasury, which commissioned the report, simultaneously published a document of favourable comments on the Review. Those quoted include: * Paul Wolfowitz, former President of the World Bank * Claude Mandil, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency * Kirit Parikh, Member, Planning Commission, Government of India * Adair Turner, Former Director of UK Confederation of British Industry and Economic Advisor to Sustainable Development Commission * Sir Rod Eddington, Adviser to the UK Government on the long term links between transport and economic growth, and former chief executive of British Airways Several academic economists are also quoted praising the Review (see Response of economists). Negative critical response The Stern Review has received various critical responses. Some economists have argued that the Review overestimates the present value of the costs of climate change, and underestimates the costs of emission reduction. Other critics have argued that the economic cost of the proposals put forward by Stern would be severe, or that the scientific consensus view on global warming, on which Stern relied, is incorrect. By contrast, some argue that the Review emission reduction targets are too weak, and that the climate change damage estimates in the Review are too small. =General criticisms= In an article in the Daily Telegraph (2006), Ruth Lea, Director of the Centre for Policy Studies, questions the scientific consensus on climate change on which the Stern Review is based. She says that \\"authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change (i.e., carbon emissions) to have a predictable effect in magnitude, or even direction.\\" Lea questions the long-term economic projections made in the Review, commenting that economic forecasts for just two or three years ahead are usually wrong. Lea goes on to describe the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as \\"monumentally complex\\", and doubts whether the international co-operation on climate change, as argued for in the Review, is really possible. In conclusion, Lea says that the real motive behind the Review is to justify increased tax on fuels. Yohe and Tol (2007) described Lea's article as a climate sceptics 'scattershot approach' aiming to confuse the public by questioning the causal role of , by emphasising the complexity of making economic predictions and by attributing a motive for Stern's conclusions. Miles Templeman, Director-General of the Institute of Directors, said: \\"Without countries like the US, China or India, making decisive commitments, UK competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer if we act alone. This would be bad for business, bad for the economy and ultimately bad for our climate.\\" Prof. Bill McGuire of Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre said that Stern may have greatly underestimated the effects of global warming. David Brown and Leo Peskett of the Overseas Development Institute, a UK think-tank on international development, argued that the key proposals in relation to how to use forests to tackle climate change may prove difficult to implement: Soon after publication of the Stern Review, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson gave a lecture at the Centre for Policy Studies, briefly criticising the Review and warning of what he called \\"eco-fundamentalism\\". In 2008, Lawson gave evidence before the House of Commons Treasury Select committee, criticising the Review. Environmental writer Bj√∏rn Lomborg criticised the Stern Review in OpinionJournal: Reason magazine's science correspondent Ronald Bailey describes the \\"destructive character\\" of the Stern Review's policy proposals, saying that \\"Surely it is reasonable to argue that if one wants to help future generations deal with climate change, the best policies would be those that encouraged economic growth. This would endow future generations with the wealth and superior technologies that could be used to handle whatever comes at them including climate change. [...] So hurrying the process of switching from carbon-based fuels along by boosting energy costs means that humanity will have to delay buying other good things such as clean water, better sanitation, more and better food, and more education.\\" Commenting on the Review's suggested increases in environmental tax, the British Chambers of Commerce have pointed to the dangers to business of additional taxation. Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute, a United States libertarian think-tank, criticised Stern's conclusion, taking a calculation by himself: In the BBC radio programme The Investigation, a number of economists and scientists argued that Stern assumptions in the Review are far more pessimistic than those made by most experts in the field, and that the Review's conclusions are at odds with the mainstream view (Cox and Vadon, 2007). In his paper on the Jevons' Paradox, which states that improvements in energy-efficiency of technologies can potentially increase greenhouse gas emission, Steve Sorrel concludes with \\"A prerequisite for all the above is a recognition that rebound effects matter and need to be taken seriously. Something is surely amiss when such in-depth and comprehensive studies as the Stern(2007) review overlook this topic altogether.\\" This criticism was rejected by the authors. They noted that by recommending a comprehensive global carbon price (see Summary above) the Stern Review proposed the most powerful mechanism for staunching the rebound effect. A carbon price imposes a wedge between the supply price received by producers and demand price paid by consumers thereby prompting substitution away from carbon intensive activities. This insures that the substitution effect offsets the income effect. In contrast to those who argued that the Stern Review was too pessimistic or 'alarmist', others argued that it did not go far enough. John Bellamy Foster, Brett Clark and Richard York in \\"the Ecological Rift\\" (2010) give considerable attention to the Stern Review, noting that the targets of 550 ppm imply a global temperature increase of at least 3 ¬∞C \\"well beyond what climate science consider dangerous, and which would bring the earth's average global temperature to a height last seen in the middle Pliocene around 3 million years ago\\" (p. 154). They posit that the basis for such high targets is 'economics, pure and simple' (p. 155), that is, stronger emissions cuts were seen by the Stern Review authors as \\"prohibitive, destabilizing capitalism itself\\" (p. 155). \\"All of this signals that any reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions beyond around 1 percent per year would make it virtually impossible to maintain strong economic growth‚Äîthe bottom line of the capitalism economy. Consequently, in order to keep the treadmill of accumulation going the world needs to risk environmental Armageddon\\" (p. 156). =Stern report misused climate change study= According to the Sunday Times article \\"Climate change study was 'misused'\\", the Stern report 'misused' disaster analysts research by Robert Muir-Wood, head of research at Risk Management Solutions, a US-based consultancy. The Stern report, citing Muir- Wood, said: ‚ÄúNew analysis based on insurance industry data has shown that weather-related catastrophe losses have increased by 2% each year since the 1970s over and above changes in wealth, inflation and population growth/movement. [‚Ä¶] If this trend continued or intensified with rising global temperatures, losses from extreme weather could reach 0.5%‚Äì1% of world GDP by the middle of the century.\\". According to Muir-Wood \\"said his research showed no such thing and accused Stern of \\"going far beyond what was an acceptable extrapolation of the evidence\\".\\".  Response of economists  =Discounting= One of the issues debated among economists was the discount rate used in the Review. Discounting is used by economists to compare economic impacts occurring at different times. Discounting was used by Stern in his calculation of the possible economic damages of future climate change. Marginal climate change damages were calculated for a \\"business-as-usual\\" greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathway. Residual climate change damages (at the margin) were also calculated for other emissions pathways, especially one peaking at 450 ppm CO2e GHG concentration. There are four main reasons commonly proposed by economists for placing a lower value on consumption occurring in the future rather than in the present: * future consumption should be discounted simply because it takes place in the future and people generally prefer the present to the future (inherent discounting) * consumption levels will be higher in the future, so the marginal utility of additional consumption will be lower * future consumption levels are uncertain * improved technology of the future will make it easier to address global warming concerns Using a high discount rate decreases the assessed benefit of actions designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Stern Review did not use a single discount rate, but applied a stochastic approach whereby the discount rate varied with the expected outcomes, reflecting the interaction between growth and the elasticity of marginal utility, in line with Frank Ramsey's growth model. The Stern Review's average discount rate for climate change damages is approximately 1.4%, which, at the time of the Review, was lower than that used in most previous economic studies on climate change. Accounting for risk in the stochastic framework, however, means the expected mean or certainty equivalent discount rate will be below the discount rate for the mean expected outcome (Dietz, 2008, p. 11). In other words, accounting for risk means a greater weight is applied to worst case outcomes, as per the insurance market. Inherent discounting Debate over the Stern Review initially focused on the first of these points. In the Review, Stern used a social discount rate based on the \\"Ramsey\\" formula, which includes a term for inherent discounting, also called the pure rate of time preference (PTP-rate): s = Œ≥ + Œ∑ g where s is the social discount rate, Œ≥ the PTP-rate, Œ∑ the marginal elasticity of utility, and g the rate of growth of per-capita consumption (Dietz, 2008, p. 10). Stern accepts the case for discounting, but argues that applying a PTP-rate of anything much more than zero to social policy choice is ethically inappropriate. His view is supported by a number of economists, including Geoffrey Heal, Thomas Sterner,William Cline, and Brad DeLong. Cline wrote a book on global warming, published in 1992, where he made similar ethical choices to Stern for discounting. DeLong, echoing Frank Ramsey and Tjalling Koopmans, wrote \\"My view‚Äîwhich I admit may well be wrong‚Äîof this knotty problem is that we are impatient in the sense of valuing the present and near- future much more than we value the distant future, but that we shouldn't do so.\\" Hal Varian stated that the choice of discount rate was an inherently ethical judgement for which there was no definitive answer. William Nordhaus, of Yale University, who has done several studies on the economics of global warming, criticised the Review for its use of a low discount rate: The difference between Stern's estimates and those of Nordhaus can largely (though not entirely) be explained by the difference in the PTP-rate. Previous studies by Nordhaus and others have adopted PTP-rates of up to 3 per cent, implying that (other things being equal) an environmental cost or benefit occurring 25 years in the future is worth about half as much as the same benefit today. Richard Tol argues that in estimating discounting rates and the consequent social cost of carbon, the assumptions that must be made about the remote future are so uncertain that they are essentially arbitrary. Consequently, the assumptions made dominate the results and with a low discount rate the social cost of carbon is also arbitrary. In an appearance before the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee (2008), Stern was asked about the discount rate used in the Review: > Stern: [...] We are in pretty good company here in that [the distinguished > economists] Solow, Sen, Keynes, Ramsey and all kinds of people have adopted > the approach to pure time discounting that we have adopted. It is not > particularly unusual. John Roemer, Humberto Llavador and Joaquim Silvestre have argued that an analysis of the problem must consider both the ethical and economic issues associated with discounting. They have made the claim that high rates of discounting as the ones proposed by Nordhaus are only consistent with the infinitely-lived-representative-agent approach to economic modelling. Intergenerational justice would require more realistic assumption: one particular view is what they call the \\"sustainabilitarian\\" approach, which seeks to maximise present consumption subject to the constraint that future generations enjoy a quality of life at least as good as that enjoyed by the current generation. They support the discount factors used in the Stern analysis, particularly the view that discounting should reflect only the probability that the world will end at a given future date, and not the \\"impatience\\" of an infinitely lived representative consumer.) Treatment of uncertainty Uncertainty about future consumption may be addressed either through adjustments to the discount rate or by replacing uncertain flows of consumption with certainty equivalent flows. Stern adopted the latter approach, but was criticised by Tol and Yohe (2006) for double counting, a claim rejected by the Stern Review team (Dietz et al., 2007, pp. 138‚Äì139). Whilst critical of Stern's discounting, Martin Weitzman has argued that standard discounting procedures are inherently incapable of dealing with extreme, low-probability events, such as the risk of catastrophic climate change. Future consumption will be higher With increasing average consumption in future, the marginal utility of consumption will decline. The elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption (part of the social discount rate) may be interpreted as a measure of aversion to inequality. Partha Dasgupta has criticised the Stern Review for parametric choices that, he argues, are inadequately sensitive to inequality. In subsequent debate, Stern has conceded the case for a higher elasticity, but noted that this would call for much more extensive redistribution of income within the current generation (Dietz et al. 2007. pp. 135‚Äì137). Improved technology As far as discounting is concerned, the effects of improved technology work through increased consumption and do not need to be treated separately. However, specification of an optimal response to climate change will depend on assumptions about improvements in technology and the extent to which such improvements will be induced by policies that increase the cost of emissions. Market rates Both supporters and opponents of Stern's discount rate have used comparisons with market rates of return on capital to justify their position. Robert Mendelsohn of Yale University is a critic of the Review and has said: > [...] investments in mitigation that cannot even earn a positive rate of > return will be worth far less to future generations than those same dollars > invested in the market. Placing climate change before investments in other > important nonmarket services such as conservation, health, education, > security, and transportation also cannot be justified in the name of future > generations. From the perspective of future generations, it is in their > interest that all investments earn the same rate of return. The ethical > justification for intentionally overspending on selective projects with low > rates of return is weak indeed . Nordhaus has been very critical of the Ramsey zero pure time preference on the basis of utilitarian ethical stance. He takes a strictly market based view of intergenerational projects arguing that the social rate of time preference reflects the rate of return observed in the marketplace. Nordhaus also raised his view that the present generation will have to forgo a large amount of consumption now for the benefit of future generations who will be much richer than the present generation. Dasgupta argues that there is some confusion in the Stern review about the underlying rationale for the selection of the Ramsey parameters. He states that the review mixes both market returns on investment with parameters selected on ethical grounds. The discount rate chosen by Stern is close to the real interest rate for government bonds. The higher rates preferred by Stern's critics are closer to the weighted average cost of capital for private investment; see the extensive review by Frederick et al. (2002) According to Quiggin, the difference between the two is determined by the equity premium. Quiggin says that there is no generally accepted theory accounting for the observed magnitude of the equity premium and hence no easy way of determining which approach, if either, should be regarded as the appropriate market comparator. =General comments= HM Treasury have issued a document where several economists are quoted praising the Stern Review, includingRobert Solow, James Mirrlees, Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz, and Jeffrey Sachs. Sachs and Stiglitz have also written favourable articles on the Review. Richard Tol, an environmental economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute, is highly critical of the Stern Review, and has said that \\"If a student of mine were to hand in this report [the Stern Review] as a Masters thesis, perhaps if I were in a good mood I would give him a 'D' for diligence; but more likely I would give him an 'F' for fail (Cox and Vadon, 2007). There is a whole range of very basic economics mistakes that somebody who claims to be a Professor of Economics simply should not make. [...] Stern consistently picks the most pessimistic for every choice that one can make. He overestimates through cherry-picking, he double counts particularly the risks and he underestimates what development and adaptation will do to impacts.\\" Tol has referred to the Stern Review as \\"populist science.\\" In a paper published in 2008, Tol showed that the Stern Review's estimate of the social cost of carbon (SCC) along a \\"business-as-usual\\" emissions pathway was an outlier in the economics literature.See also Tol chose to omit two of Stern's SCC estimates. The omitted SCC estimates are both associated with emissions pathways leading to a stabilisation of GHG concentrations: one at 450 ppm CO2e and the other 550 ppm (p. 2 of this source) The Stern Review differed strongly from most other estimates of climate change costs in the economics literature in 2006Adapted from a portion of Figure 1 in Tol and Yohe (2006) \\"A Review of the Stern Review\\" World Economics 7(4): 233‚Äì50. Harvard economist Martin Weitzman has written a paper on the Stern Review (Weitzman, 2007). This paper is also available (PDF) from Weitzman's website, with the alternative title, \\"The Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change\\" In this paper, Weitzman described himself as \\"skeptical\\" in regards to the discount rate used by Stern in the Review's formal (aggregated) assessment of climate change.Weitzman, 2007, p. 703 One of Weitzman's conclusions was that Stern deserved credit for increasing public awareness on the dangers of climate change.Weitzman, 2007, p. 724 However, Weitzman also commented that: > [...] in my opinion, Stern deserves a measure of discredit for giving > readers an authoritative-looking impression that seemingly objective best- > available-practice professional economic analysis robustly supports its > conclusions, instead of more openly disclosing the full extent to which the > Review's radical policy recommendations depend upon controversial extreme > assumptions and unconventional discount rates that most mainstream > economists would consider much too low According to a paper Yohe and Tol (2007), the Stern Review is \\"right for the wrong reasons.\\" At a seminar held in 2006, Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta commented on the Stern Review. Dasgupta's comments from this seminar were later published in the following paper: Dasgupta (2006, p. 1) described the Review as \\"a long and impressive document,\\" but felt that the authors had treated the issue of intergenerational equity (via the social discount rate) \\"cavalierly\\". Dasgupta (2006, pp. 6‚Äì7) accepted the Review's argument for a PTP-rate of 0.1%, but did not accept Stern's choice of 1 for the elasticity of marginal utility. He argued this point by calculating a saving rate of 97.5% based on the Review's values for the PTP-rate and elasticity of marginal utility. Dasgupta stated that \\"[a] 97.5% savings rate is so patently absurd that we must reject it out of hand.\\" The calculation by Dasgupta was based on a model which had a deterministic economy, constant population, and no technological change. Dasgupta's calculation was later cited by Berkeley economist Hal Varian. Writing in the New York Times newspaper, Varian commented \\"Sir Partha's stripped-down model leaves out uncertainty, technological change and population growth, but even so, such a high savings rate is totally implausible.\\" Varian also questioned whether or not it was ethical for the current generation to transfer wealth to future generations (via investment in mitigation), who, given Stern's assumptions, would be much wealthier than we presently are. Smith (2009) responded to Dasgupta's criticism of the Stern Review's implied savings rate. Smith's work is also available as: K.Smith (2010), 'Stern, Climate Policy and Saving Rates, Climate Policy 10(3) She showed that the rates of PTP and risk aversion in the Stern Review are consistent with saving rates of 25‚Äì32% rather than 97.5% when a macroeconomic model with the production function actually used by Stern and Nordhaus is used. According to Dietz (2008, pp. 10‚Äì11), Varian's analysis had apparently confused the PTP-rate with the social discount rate. The PTP-rate, if positive, discounts the welfare of future generations even if they are poorer than the current generation. The social discount rate used by Stern, however, accounts for the possible increased wealth (consumption) of future generations through the product Œ∑g (see the formula cited in the section on inherent discounting). Terry Barker of the Tyndall Centre Climate Change Research wrote a paper (Barker, 2008) supportive of the Review. Barker was critical of how some economists have applied cost-benefit analysis to climate change: > [...] the Stern Review considers cost-benefit analysis as a marginal > analysis inappropriately applied to a non-marginal multi-disciplinary > systemic problem (p. 50). Both Stern (p. 163) and the IPCC Reports after > 1995 take a multi-criteria approach rather than a narrowly monetary one and > question cost-benefit analysis. This is one reason for the intemperate > response from some traditional economists to the Stern Review Eric Neumayer (2007) of the London School of Economics thought that the Review could have argued for emission reductions based on the non-substitutable loss of natural capital. Neumayer argued that the real issue is the non- substitutable loss of natural capital, that is to what extent climate change inflicts irreversible and non-substitutable damage to and loss of natural capital. Economists define natural capital as the multiple and various services of nature from which humans benefit- from natural resources to pollution absorption and environmental amenities. Dieter Helm (2008) of Oxford University was critical of the Review's analysis but accepted its conclusion of the urgent need to reduce emissions. Helm justified this on the grounds that future damages to the environment would probably not be fully compensated for by increases in man-made capital. The draft report of the Garnaut Climate Change Review, a similar study conducted in Australia in 2008 by Ross Garnaut broadly endorsed the approach undertaken by Stern, but concluded, in the light of new information, that Stern had underestimated the severity of the problem and the extent of the cuts in emissions that were required to avoid dangerous climate change. The Yale Symposium In 2007, a symposium was held at Yale University on the Stern Review, with talks by several economists, including Nordhaus and Stern (Yale Symposium, 2007). Stern presented the basic conclusions of the Review, and commented on some of the criticisms of it made by other speakers. Chris Hope of Cambridge University explained how the damage estimates in the Review were calculated. Hope designed the PAGE2002 integrated assessment model that was used in the Review. Hope explained what would happen to the Stern Review's damage estimates if they were made using different assumptions, for example, a higher discount rate. Hope also pointed to the assumptions used in the model to do with adaptation. In his talk, Nordhaus criticised the fact that the Stern Review had not been subject to a peer- review, and repeated earlier criticisms of the Review's discount rate. William Cline of the Peterson Institute supported the Review's general conclusions, but was uncomfortable about how most (greater than 90%) of the Review's monetised damages of climate change occur after 2200. Cline noted that the Review's large cost-benefit ratio for mitigation policy allows room for these long-term costs to be reduced substantially but still support aggressive action to reduce emissions. Robert Mendelsohn was critical of the way the Stern justified his suggested mitigation policy in the Review. Mendelsohn said that rather than finding an optimal policy, the Review presented a choice of policy versus no-policy. Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University questioned some of the assumptions used in Nordhaus's integrated assessment model (DICE) of climate change. Sachs was supportive of Stern's cost estimates of climate change mitigation. In response to these talks, Stern accepted Cline's comment about the weighting of future damages, and said that the weighting of these damages could be reduced by the increasing the size of the elasticity of marginal utility in the social discount rate. With regards to criticisms of the discount rate, Stern accepted that differences of opinion could exist on his ethical choice for the PTP-rate (Yale Symposium, 2007, p. 118). Other comments by Stern included what he viewed as confusion over what he had suggested as a possible level for a carbon tax. According to Stern, the tax will not necessarily be the same as the social cost of carbon due to distortions and uncertainties in the economy (p. 121). His suggested tax rate was in the range of 25 to 30 dollars per ton of carbon. Stern did not accept Mendelsohn's argument that the Review presented a choice of policy versus no policy. Stern commented that the arguments for his recommended stabilisation range were included in Chapter 13 of the Review (pp. 124‚Äì125). The costs of mitigation Economists have different views over the cost estimates of climate change mitigation given in the Review. Paul Ekins of King's College London (Treasury Committee, 2008) has said that Stern's central mitigation cost estimate is \\"reasonable,\\" but economists Robert Mendelsohn and Dieter Helm have commented that the estimate is probably too low. According to Mendelsohn, the Stern Review is far too optimistic about mitigation costs, stating that \\"[one] of the depressing things about the greenhouse gas problem is that the cost of eliminating it is quite high. We will actually have to sacrifice a great deal to cut emissions dramatically\\" (Mendelsohn, 2007). Professor Emeritus of Economics at Pepperdine University George Reisman has said that \\"Any serious consideration of the proposals made in the Stern Review for radically reducing carbon technology and the accompanying calls for immediacy in enacting them makes clear in a further way how utterly impractical the environmentalist program for controlling global warming actually is. The fundamental impracticality of the program, of course, lies in its utterly destructive character.\\" In a response to a paper by members of the Stern Review team, John Weyant of Stanford University commented on how the cost estimate of mitigation used in the Review was based on idealised models (Mendelsohn et al., 2008). Weyant wrote that his own high short-run cost projection for stabilisation, of possibly 10% GDP, resulted \\"primarily from institutional pessimism rather than technological pessimism.\\" Comparison with climate damages Nobel prize winner Kenneth Arrow has commented on the Stern Review in the Economist's Voice (Arrow, 2007a) and for Project Syndicate (Arrow, 2007b): Arrow analysed the Stern Review's conclusions by looking at the Review's central estimate of GHG stabilisation costs of 1% GNP, and high- end climate damages of 20% GNP (Arrow, 2007a, pp. 4‚Äì5). As part of the Ramsay formula for the social discount rate, Arrow chose a value of 2 for the marginal elasticity of utility, while in the Review, Stern chose a value of 1. According to Arrow, Stern's recommended stabilisation target passes a cost- benefit test even when considerably higher PTP-rate (up to around 8%) than Stern's (0.1%) is used. Arrow acknowledged that his argument depended on Stern's stabilisation central cost estimate being correct. Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University noted that Stern's estimates of business-as-usual climate damages were given in terms of per capita consumption equivalents, but Stern's costs of mitigation were given in terms of a percentage reduction in gross world product. Yohe stated that the two different measures are \\"not really at all comparable.\\" Yohe commented on how the Review gives the impression that all climate damages can be avoided through the investment of 1% of world GDP in mitigation. This, however, would still lead to global warming (as per the Review's 550 ppm CO2e mitigation target) of around 1.5 to 4.5 ¬∞C above pre- industrial temperatures. Significant portions of climate damages would therefore still persist with Stern's mitigation target. To measure the benefit of Stern's mitigation target, the residual climate damages from mitigation would need to be subtracted from Stern's business-as-usual climate damages. =Ecological Economic Critique= The main criticisms cited above concern the details of calculations and modelling choices within an orthodox economic framing of the world and mostly try to argue against substantive greenhouse gas mitigation. Ecological economists accept the need for serious action but reject the reasoning of economic commensuration of costs and benefits, the probabilistic approach to uncertainty and the application of a utilitarian intergenerational calculus.Spash, C. L. (2002) Greenhouse Economics: Value and Ethics. London, Routledge. Their criticism applies equally to the likes of Nordhaus and Tol.Funtowicz, S. O. and J. R. Ravetz (1994) The worth of a songbird: Ecological economics as a post-normal science. Ecological Economics 10(3): 197‚Äì207.Spash, C. L. (2007) Understanding climate change: Need for new economic thought. Economic and Political Weekly February(10th): 483‚Äì490.Spash, C. L. (2007) Problems in economic assessments of climate change with attention to the USA. Frontiers in Environmental Valuation and Policy. J. Erickson and J. Gowdy. Cheltenham, UK/Northampton, MA, USA, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd. The orthodox economic debate is seen as a distraction from the basic ethical issues e.g. discounting instead of justice. A more fundamental criticism of the Stern report is that it raises a series of problems which it totally fails to address because of its orthodox approach. It simultaneously ignores a range of critical literature from ecological economics and environmental ethics which challenges such orthodox thinking.Daily, G. C., P. R. Ehrlich, H. A. Mooney and A. H. Ehrlich (1991) Greenhouse economics: Learn before you leap. Ecological Economics 4: 1‚Äì10.Spash, C. L. (1994) Double CO2 and beyond: Benefits, costs and compensation. Ecological Economics 10(1): 27‚Äì36.Spash, C. L. (1993) Economics, ethics, and long-term environmental damages. Environmental Ethics 15(2): 117‚Äì132 Stern as an orthodox economist squeezes all matters and concepts into a narrow mathematical formalism which heterodox economists, such as Tony Lawson, point out fails to address economic and social reality.Lawson, T. (1997) Economics & Reality. London, Routledge. In conventional cost-benefit analysis, biodiversity and ecosystem services that are not valued as losses are difficult to quantify. Neumayer argues that the real issue is non-substitutable loss of natural capital; to what extent climate change inflicts irreversible and non-substitutable damage to and loss of natural capital.Neumayer (2007) A missed opportunity: the Stern review on climate change fails to tackle the issue of non-substitutable loss of natural capital For example, it would be difficult to quantify the loss of coral reefs, biodiversity loss, or species extinction. Dietz points out that in many Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), health and ecosystem impacts are not included because the monetary valuation of these impacts is ‚Äúspeculative and uncertain‚Äù.Dietz et al, 2007. Reflections on the Stern Review. Dasgupta (2008) also points out most model do not consider natural capital.Dasgupta, P., 2008. Discounting Climate change Although recent studies on ecosystem services have made gains in monetising the value of ecosystems, more recent studies on ecosystem services suggest the Stern Review underestimates the need for mitigation action as it is difficult for models to quantify the collapse of ecosystem services under climate change. Thus, ecological economist Clive Spash has questioned whether the report is nothing more than an exercise in rhetoric.Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts √† la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted?‚Äô Ecological Economics 63(4): 706‚Äì713. Spash notes that a range of serious problems challenging economic analysis is raised or mentioned in the report including: strong uncertainty, incommensurability, plural values, non-utilitarian ethics, rights, distributional inequity, poverty, and treatment of future generations. How then can this report, acknowledging so many of those aspects of climate change that render orthodox economic analysis unsuitable for generating policy recommendations, go ahead to conduct a global cost-benefit calculation based on microeconomic theory and make that the foundation for its policy recommendations? Spash has argued that issues are suppressed and sidelined in a careful and methodical manner, with the pretense they have been addressed by ‚Äòstate of the art‚Äô solutions. Meanwhile, the authors maintain allegiance to an economic orthodoxy which perpetuates the dominant political myth that traditional economic growth can be both sustained and answer all our problems.Spash, C. L. (2007) Fallacies of economic growth in addressing environmental losses: Human induced climatic change. Newsletter of the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics (ANZSEE)(May): 2‚Äì4. Besides perpetuating myths, this diverts attention away from alternative approaches, away from ethical debates over harming the innocent, the poor and future generations, and away from the fundamental changes needed to tackle the very real and serious problems current economic systems pose for environmental systems. In addition the policy recommendation of carbon trading is seen as deeply flawed for also failing to take account of social, ecological and economic reality.  Response to criticisms  The Stern Review team have responded to criticisms of the Review in a number of papers. In these papers, they reassert their view that early and strong action on climate change is necessary: > The case for strong and urgent action set out in the Review is based, first, > on the severe risks that the science now identifies (together with the > additional uncertainties [...] that it points to but that are difficult to > quantify) and, second, on the ethics of the responsibilities of existing > generations in relation to succeeding generations. It is these two things > that are crucial: risk and ethics. Different commentators may vary in their > emphasis, but it is the two together that are crucial. Jettison either one > and you will have a much reduced programme for action‚Äîand if you judge risks > to be small and attach little significance to future generations you will > not regard global warming as a problem. It is surprising that the earlier > economic literature on climate change did not give risk and ethics the > attention they so clearly deserve, and it is because we chose to make them > central and explicit that we think we were right for the right reasons. Members of the Stern Review team have also given several talks that have covered criticisms of the Review. A talk given by Dimitri Zenghelis at the Tyndall Centre looked at criticisms of the Review and presented an overview of its main findings. In an official letter (2008), Joan Ruddock MP of the UK Government, dismisses the criticisms of the Review made by several economists, which, in her view, show \\"a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of formal, highly aggregated economic modelling in evaluating a policy issue\\". Stern's later comments In April 2008 Stern said that the severity of his findings were vindicated by the 2007 IPCC report and admitted that in the Stern Review, \\"We underestimated the risks [...] we underestimated the damage associated with temperature increases [...] and we underestimated the probabilities of temperature increases\\". In June 2008, Stern said that because climate change is happening faster than predicted, the cost to reduce carbon would be even higher, of about 2% of GDP instead of the 1% in the original report. In an interview at the 2013 World Economic Forum, Stern said \\"Looking back, I underestimated the risks. The planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less carbon than we expected, and emissions are rising pretty strongly. Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought then\\" in the 2006 Review. He now believes we are \\"on track for something like four degrees\\".

The Herald was originally located in a small building at 624 San Mateo Avenue (next to the San Bruno Volunteer Fire Department),San Bruno Herald building, ca. 1940 then it moved to a larger facility on the corner of Angus and Mastick avenues, and finally to a shared facility on San Mateo Avenue in South San Francisco. History The first editorial campaign of the Herald was to promote the incorporation of San Bruno, which was successful.Article by Jack Bik The newspaper operated as a daily newspaper for several years before resuming weekly publication.Interview with Herald staff It was published every Thursday morning, then distributed to homes and newsstands. For many years its publisher was A.I. Cloud (1904-1993), who also published two other weekly newspapers, the Recorder Progress, published every Wednesday morning, and the Coastside Chroncicle, published every Saturday morning. In 1968, the combined circulation of the three newspapers was 50,000.Interview with A.I. Cloud The Herald eventually added a small Saturday edition. The longtime news editor was Jack Bik (1922-1984), who wrote most of the editorials and numerous feature stories. Its sports editor and principal photographer was Warren Wynkoop (1930-1976), who also hosted a program on KCSM (FM) in San Mateo. Wynkoop regularly covered the career of MLB pitcher Wally Bunker, who graduated from San Bruno's Capuchino High School in June 1963. The women's editor was Jane Dryden.San Bruno Herald archives The paper relied heavily on part-time columnists, contributors, and sports reporters. High school journalism students regularly covered meetings of the San Bruno City Council, the San Bruno Planning Commission, and the San Bruno Park School District board meetings. There were columns devoted to various districts in San Bruno. A longtime contributor to the paper was Bessie Baughn (1917-1999), sometimes called \\"Aunt Bessie,\\" who wrote a column, originally called \\"Cruising Through Crestmoor,\\" and regularly interviewed visiting celebrities such as Jerry Lewis, Danny Thomas, and James Stewart. There was extensive coverage of local high school and college sports, which won the paper numerous state journalism awards. The paper publicized and reviewed productions and concerts at Capuchino High School and Crestmoor High School. In the mid 1960s publisher Cloud bought a new photo offset printing press, which was installed at the Heralds offices on the corner of Angus and Mastick avenues, one block east of San Mateo Avenue. However, the paper faced increasing deficits and Cloud eventually sold it to Amphlett Printing Company, the owners of The San Mateo Times, in 1968. To cut costs, Amphlett cut staff and eventually moved the offices and publishing facilities from Angus Avenue to a central facility on San Mateo Avenue in South San Francisco, where the Herald shared offices with weekly newspapers serving Daly City and South San Francisco.Robert E. Nylund, Herald contributor, 1964-1985 In 1998, Amphlett's newspapers were sold to ANG Newspapers (Alameda Newspaper Group), an Oakland-based subsidiary of MediaNews Group of Denver, Colorado. The weekly newspapers shared editorial staff, often publishing the same stories in each paper, except for the front page. There was less coverage of San Bruno news in the Herald, even before the sale, resulting in independent papers such as The San Bruno Beacon, whose editor and publisher is former San Bruno Vice Mayor and City Councilman Bill Baker, and the Millbrae Sun. Within a few years, the Herald ceased publication. The San Mateo Times was renamed San Mateo County Times and became the main newspaper for the county. The only county weekly to survive under ANG's ownership was the Pacifica Tribune.MediaNews Group website  References  Category:Newspapers published in California Category:Defunct newspapers published in California Category:San Bruno, California ","title":"San Bruno Herald"},{"id":"7694318","text":"Melittosphex burmensis is one of the two oldest-known species of bees. The species was described from an amber inclusion in Burmese Amber in the year 2006 by George Poinar, Jr., a zoologist at Oregon State University. The fossil was found in a mine in the Hukawng Valley of northern Myanmar and is believed to date from the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Etymology Melitta is a form of the Greek word ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒπœÉœÉŒ± (melissa), \\"honey bee\\",ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒπœÉœÉŒ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus. while Sphex is a transliteration of the Greek word œÉœÜŒÆŒæ, wasp.  Description  M. burmensis is approximately one-fifth the size of the extant honeybee, at about 3 millimetres long. It is not closely related to any extant bee family. M. burmensis has some anatomical features similar to those of flesh-eating wasps, including the shape of its hind legs, but also some features of pollen-collecting bees, such as branched hairs on the body. The bee's head is heart-shaped. The sample discovered is thought to be 100 million years old, 40 million years older than the next-oldest known bee species at the time. In 2020, a second new species in a different genus and family, Discoscapa apicula, was described from the same amber deposit. The discovery of bees from the Cretaceous Period with certain pollen-collecting features may help to explain the rapid expansion of flowering plants at that time in earth's history. Poinar and bee researcher Bryan Danforth described M. burmensis in the journal Science.

He has been a journalist for several decades, appearing in print media and on television, and has written several books. He has also taught in several universities, both in Argentina and abroad. As an academic Grondona studied Law and Social Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). He did postgraduate studies on Sociology at the University of Madrid, and on Political Science at the Political Studies Institute of Madrid. Since 1984 he has been a professor of Political Law at UBA. From the mid-1980s until the 1990s he was a visiting professor and researcher at the University of Harvard. Media career Mr. Grondona for many years wrote for and ,in its last years, directed the most important post war hemispheric magazine, Visi√≥n:La Revista Latinoamericana, between 1978 and 1995. He was the international news writer for the daily newspaper La Naci√≥n between 1987 and 1996, and later become a political op-ed writer in the same newspaper, a position he still holds . La Naci√≥n. Columnists' profile - Mariano Grondona . Since 1989, he hosts his own weekly TV program. In 1997 he received the Platinum- and Diamond Konex Award for Communication-Journalism, and have been awarded the Konnex Merit Diploma on the field of Political Analysis in 1987. CV at the Konnex Foundation. During the 2000s he has hosted two radio shows, Las claves del d√≠a and Pensando con Mariano Grondona. Political standing Grondona's views are considered right wing, with a strong Catholic element (as opposed to the more liberal ideology of other right-wing opinion leaders such as the late √Ålvaro Alsogaray). In matters of Argentine foreign policy, he favors alignment with the United States. In the mid-1960s, Grondona supported the coup that brought dictator Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a to the presidency, and later held public office in his government, although he grew disappointed and was later dismissed. He stated that he \\"had tried to make a De Gaulle of Ongan√≠a, and got a Franco instead\\". In the 1970s Grondona was a supporter of presidents H√©ctor Jos√© C√°mpora and Juan Per√≥n. After Per√≥n's death during his term, Grondona supported the policies of Isabel Per√≥n's Welfare Minister Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, founder of the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance. As Isabel Per√≥n's government fell apart, he advocated the participation of the military, and welcomed the beginning of the National Reorganization Process in 1976. A non-authorized biography of Grondona, El Doctor, by Mart√≠n Sivak (2005), pointed out that he worked as an advisor of military junta member Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo, on whose request he wrote a government programme titled Bases Pol√≠ticas para la Reorganizaci√≥n Nacional (echoing Juan Bautista Alberdi's Bases and Points of Departure for the Political Organization of the Argentine Republic).

She was sunk by a mine off La Pallice, France, in 1940‚Äîone of the earliest passenger ship losses of the Second World War. Although not as well remembered as her larger fleetmates, the Champlain was the first modern ocean liner and embodied many design features later incorporated into the French Line's SS Normandie. Her interiors were designed by Ren√© Prou who decorated spaces on several earlier French Line ships, including the cabin motorship '. When she made her d√©but in June 1932, the Champlain was the largest, fastest, and most luxurious cabin class liner afloat. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Champlain was pressed into evacuee work, transporting refugees from Europe to the safety of North America. This included many European Jews escaping Nazi Europe. Vladimir Nabokov and his family were passengers on the last voyage to New York in May 1940. It was on the return trip that the Champlain met her fate. On 17 June 1940, the liner struck a German air-laid mine while swinging at anchor in the waters off La Pallice, France, near √éle de R√©, and quickly heeled over on her side. A few days later the German submarine U-65 fired a torpedo into the hulk ‚Äì‚Äì possibly to finish her off, as much of the ship lay above water level. Many sources quote a wire service report from 1940 that as many as 300 lives were lost but this is erroneous. Although there were many injuries there were only 11 or 12 fatalities. She was one of the largest ships sunk in World War II. Her wreck lay quite visible for over twenty years and was eventually scrapped in 1965.

He is currently a professor of chemistry and director of both the Institute for Materials Research and the Materials Science and Engineering program at Binghamton University, State University of New York. He also serves as director of the Northeastern Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES) of the U.S. Department of Energy at Binghamton. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 alongside Akira Yoshino and John B. Goodenough. Whittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of lithium-ion batteries, which now are used in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles. He discovered the intercalation electrodes in the 1970s for the first time and thoroughly described the concept of intercalation reaction for rechargeable batteries in the late of 1970s. He holds the original patents on the concept of the use of intercalation chemistry in high power-density, highly reversible lithium-ion batteries. And he invented the first rechargeable lithium-ion battery, patented in 1977, and assigned to Exxon. His work on lithium-ion batteries laid the foundations for others' later developments. Therefore, he is the called Founding Father of lithium-ion batteries.https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/117/09/1416.pdf  Education and career  Whittingham was born in Nottingham, England, on 22 December 1941. He was educated at Stamford School in Lincolnshire from 1951‚Äì1960, before going to New College, Oxford to read Chemistry. At the University of Oxford, he took his BA (1964), MA (1967), and DPhil (1968). After completing his graduate studies, Whittingham was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. He then worked for Exxon Research & Engineering Company for 16 years. He then spent four years working for Schlumberger prior to becoming a professor at Binghamton University. From 1994 to 2000, he served as the University's vice provost for research. He also served as Vice-Chair of the Research Foundation of the State University of New York for six years. He is currently a Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Materials Science and Engineering at Binghamton University. Whittingham was named Chief Scientific Officer of NAATBatt International in 2017. Whittingham co-chaired the DOE study of Chemical Energy Storage in 2007, and is now Director of the Northeastern Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES), a U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) at Binghamton. In 2014, NECCES was awarded $12.8 million, from the U.S. Department of Energy to help accelerate scientific breakthroughs needed to build a new 21st-century economy. In 2018, NECCES was given another $3 million by the Department of Energy to continue its important research on batteries. The NECCES team is using the funding to make energy-storage materials work better and to develop new materials that are \\"cheaper, environmentally friendly, and able to store more energy than current materials can\\".  Research  Whittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of lithium-ion batteries, discovering the concept of intercalation electrodes. Exxon manufactured Whittingham's lithium-ion battery in the 1970s, the first functional rechargeable battery in the world, which was based on a titanium disulfide cathode and a lithium- aluminum anode. The battery had high energy density and the diffusion of lithium ions into the titanium disulphide cathode was reversible, making the battery rechargeable. In addition, titanium disulphide has a particularly fast rate of lithium ion diffusion into the crystal lattice. Exxon threw its resources behind the commercialization of a Li/LiClO4/ TiS2 battery. Safety concerns left Exxon to end the project. Whittingham and his team continued to publish their work in academic journals of electrochemistry and solid-state physics. He eventually left Exxon in 1984 and spent four years at Schlumberger as a Manager. In 1988, he accepted the position of Professor at the Chemistry Department, Binghamton University, U.S. to pursue his academic interests. \\"All these batteries are called intercalation batteries. It‚Äôs like putting jam in a sandwich. In the chemical terms, it means you have a crystal structure, and we can put lithium ions in, take them out, and the structure‚Äôs exactly the same afterwards,\\" Whittingham said \\"We retain the crystal structure. That‚Äôs what makes these lithium batteries so good, allows them to cycle for so long.\\" Today's lithium batteries are limited in capacity because less than one lithium-ion/electron is reversibly intercalated per transition metal redox center. To achieve higher energy densities, one approach is to go beyond the one electron redox intercalation reactions of the above systems. Currently, Whittingham's research has advanced to multi-electron intercalation reactions, which can increase the storage capacity by intercalating multiple lithium ions. A few multi-electron intercalation materials have been successfully developed by Whittingham, like LiVOPO4/VOPO4, etc. The multivalent vanadium cation (V3+<->V5+) plays an important role to accomplish the multi-electron reactions. These promising materials shine lights on the battery industry to increase energy density rapidly. He received the Young Author Award from The Electrochemical Society in 1971, the Battery Research Award in 2003, and was elected a Fellow in 2004. In 2010, he was listed as one of the Top 40 innovators for contributions to advancing green technology by Greentech Media. In 2012, Whittingham received the IBA Yeager Award for Lifetime Contribution to Lithium Battery Materials Research, and he was elected a Fellow of Materials Research Society in 2013. He was listed along with John B. Goodenough, for pioneering research leading to the development of the lithium- ion battery on a list of Clarivate Citation Laureates for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry by Thomson Reuters in 2015. In 2018, Whittingham was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, \\"for pioneering the application of intercalation chemistry for energy storage materials.\\" In 2019, Whittingham, along with John B.

A pastiche of Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard and Larry Williams, the composition is recorded in a high-energy rock and roll style, with lead vocals by both Wood and Jeff Lynne, who were at the time jointly leaders of both the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and The Move. \\"California Man\\" reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart in May 1972. The ELO, originally conceived as a side- project of The Move, issued its first single, \\"10538 Overture\\", a month after this track. In the U.S., \\"California Man\\" was issued on the United Artists record label. It was flipped after release, when Lynne's \\"Do Ya\\" B-side proved more popular. It became The Move's only U.S. charting single, peaking at number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1972. Only Wood, Lynne and drummer Bev Bevan appear on the recording. The picture sleeve has an older picture of The Move, including bassist Rick Price, who was no longer a member of the group by then. The Move's version of the song never originally appeared on one of its studio albums; however, it does appear as a bonus track on the reissue of Message from the Country.

He is the recipient of writing awards in Europe and America. The Blackhouse won the U.S. Barry Award for Crime Novel of the Year and the national literature award in France, the CEZAM Prix Litteraire. The Lewis Man won the French daily newspaper Le T√©l√©grammes 10,000-euro Grand Prix des Lecteurs. In 2014, Entry Island won both the Deanston's Scottish Crime Novel of the Year and the UK's ITV Crime Thriller Book Club Best Read of the Year Award. May's books have sold more than two million copies in the UK and several million internationally.  Early life  Peter May was born in Glasgow. From an early age he was intent on becoming a novelist, but took up a career as a journalist as a way to start earning a living by writing. He made his first serious attempt at writing a novel at the age of 19, which he sent to Collins where it was read by Philip Ziegler, who wrote him a very encouraging rejection letter. At the age of 21, he won the Fraser Award and was named Scotland's Young Journalist of the Year. He went on to write for The Scotsman and the Glasgow Evening Times. At the age of 26, May's first novel, The Reporter, was published. May was asked to adapt the book as a television series for the British television network the BBC, and left journalism in 1978 to begin to write full-time for television.  Television career  May's novel The Reporter became the prime-time 13-part television series entitled The Standard in 1978. May went on to create another major TV series for the BBC, Squadron, a drama involving an RAF rapid deployment squadron. In the following fifteen years, May earned more than 1,000 TV credits. He created and wrote major drama serials for both BBC and the Independent Television Network in the UK including Machair which he co-created with Janice Hally for Scottish Television. The long-running serial was the first major television drama to be made in the Gaelic language and was shot entirely on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. The show, which May also produced, achieved a 33% audience share and regularly appeared in the top ten in the ratings in Scotland, in spite of the fact that it was broadcast with English subtitles because only 2% of the population of Scotland are Gaelic speakers. During his time working in television, May wrote the novels Hidden Faces (1981) and The Noble Path (1992), and in 1996 he quit television to write novels.  Novel writing career  = China = After quitting television May wrote a series of six novels known as the China Thrillers. To research the series, May made annual trips to China and built up a network of contacts including forensic pathologists and homicide detectives. He gained access to the homicide and forensic science sections of Beijing and Shanghai police forces and has made a study of the methodology of Chinese police and forensic pathology systems. As a mark of their respect for his work, the Chinese Crime Writers' Association made him an honorary member of their Beijing Chapter. He is the only Westerner to receive this honour. He has also contributed a monthly column to the Chinese Police Magazine Contemporary World Police. The books were first published in the UK between 1999 and 2004 and subsequently published worldwide in translation. New editions were published for the United States and UK in 2016/17 with an introduction by May explaining the historical setting of the books. = France = Peter May lives in France and his China Thrillers have received several nominations for awards in that country. In 2007 he won the Prix Intramuros. This prize is unique in France as it is awarded by juries of readers made up of prisoners in French penitentiaries. The books under consideration are reduced to a shortlist of 6 finalists and the authors of the shortlisted books then have to travel to various French prisons to be interviewed by panels of detainees. In 2007, May was the only non-French author in the shortlist. He received the prize at the annual Polar&Co; literary festival in Cognac. The Enzo Files is set in France and is centred on the work of half-Italian, half-Scottish Enzo Macleod. This former forensic scientist, now working as a biology professor at a French university becomes involved in applying the latest scientific methods to solve cold cases. May tried to ensure authenticity in the details of his books by researching in France just as he did in China. When writing The Critic ‚Äì which involves the wine industry and is set in Gaillac, France ‚Äì May took a course in wine- tasting, picked grapes by hand, and was invited by the winemakers of the region to be inducted as a Chevalier de la Dive Bouteille de Gaillac in December 2007. In April 2016, after 15 years of living full-time in France and a connection with the department of the Lot that goes back more than 40 years, May was welcomed as a French citizen at a ceremony of naturalisation by Catherine Ferrier, the Pr√©f√®te of the Lot. = Second Life = While working on his standalone thriller Virtually Dead, May researched the book by creating an avatar in the online world of Second Life and opening the Flick Faulds private detective agency.http://www.flickfaulds.com He spent a year in Second Life, working as a private detective, and was hired by clients for cases ranging from protection from harassment by stalkers to surveillance and infidelity investigations. = The Lewis Trilogy = After being turned down by all the major British publishers, The Blackhouse, the first book in 'The Lewis Trilogy', was published first in May's adopted home of France in French translation at the end of 2009. The book was hailed as \\"a masterpiece\\" by the French daily newspaper L'Humanit√© and was immediately nominated for several literary awards in France. It won the Prix des Lecteurs at Le Havre's Ancres Noires Festival in 2010 and won the French national literature award, the Cezam Prix Litt√©raire Inter CE at an award ceremony in Strasbourg in October 2011. The Blackhouse went on to be published all over Europe and was bought by British publishers Quercus who brought it out in February 2011. It is the first of three books to be set in the Outer Hebrides, an archipelago off the North West coast of Scotland. The Blackhouse was chosen for the Richard & Judy Book Club autumn 2011 list. The second book in the trilogy, The Lewis Man, was published in January 2012, and spent 18 weeks in the UK hardbacks best sellers' list. It has won two French literature awards, the Prix des Lecteurs at Le Havre's Ancres Noires Festival, 2012 and the Prix des Lecteurs du T√©l√©gramme, readers prize of France's Le T√©l√©gramme newspaper; the 10,000 euro award was presented to May at a ceremony in Brest in May 2012. The Lewis Man won the 2012 Prix International at the Cognac Festival. The third book in the trilogy, The Chessmen was published in January 2013.

It was named after supporters of Millwall F.C., who had a reputation for football hooliganism. The Millwall brick was allegedly used as a stealth weapon at football matches in England during the 1960s and 1970s. The weapon's popularity appears to have been due to the wide availability of newspapers, the difficulty in restricting newspapers being brought into football grounds, and the ease of its construction.  History  In the late 1960s ‚Äî in response to football hooliganism at matches in England ‚Äî police began confiscating any objects that could be used as weapons. These items included steel combs, pens, beermats, horse brasses, Polo mints, shoelaces and boots. However, fans were still permitted to bring in newspapers. Larger broadsheet newspapers work best for a Millwall brick, and the police looked with suspicion at working class football fans who carried such newspapers. Because of their more innocent appearance, tabloid newspapers became the preferred choice for Millwall bricks. The book Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible describes the use of Millwall bricks by British football hooligans in the late 1960s: \\"Newspapers were rolled up tightly to form the so-called Millwall Brick and another trick was to make a knuckleduster out of pennies held in place by a wrapped around paper. You could hardly be pulled up for having a bit of loose change in your pocket and a Daily Mirror under your arm.\\" The book Skinhead says, \\"The Millwall brick, for example, was a newspaper folded again and again and squashed together to form a cosh.\\" Design A Millwall brick is constructed from several newspaper sheets stacked and tightly rolled lengthwise. The resulting tube is then bent in half to create a handle (a haft) and a rounded head at the fold. Cultural references *The term \\"Millwall brick\\" appeared in a 2001 Times column about the September 11, 2001 attacks, in which writer Mick Hume sarcastically proposed that airlines get rid of newspapers since \\"football hooligans used to fold them into something called a Millwall Brick.\\"Hume, Mick.

Biography The second of three children of socialite Edith Gay and conservative politician √Ålvaro Alsogaray, she was born in Buenos Aires and earned a degree in engineering at the Catholic University of Argentina in 1969. She was elected to Congress in 1985 on her father's ticket, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCeD√©), and became an outspoken defender of free markets during the presidency of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. She married Francisco Erize, and had two sons. The UCeD√© became a close ally of Justicialist Party nominee Carlos Menem after the 1989 election (in which Menem ran as a populist), and Alsogaray was appointed to head the privatizations of the ENTel state phone company in 1990 and of the Somisa state steel works in 1991. This post earned Alsogaray disapproval when reports emerged that ENTel land valued at US$180 million was gifted to its buyers; and later, when Somisa was sold to Techint in 1992 for US$152 million - one seventh the book value Jorge Triaca, her predecessor at Somisa, had estimated.P√°gina/12 (October 29, 1992): Somisa qued√≥ para Techint. Micro Semanario 85 Her personal life also attracted controversy following a July 1990 photo shoot for Noticias, Argentina's leading news magazine. The suggestive photo spread was accompanied by an interview in which her relationship with the recently divorced President Menem was discussed.Noticias: Mar√≠a Julia y su romance con el Presidente. Clar√≠n retrovisor Alsogaray was appointed Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development (environment) in November 1991,Microsemanario 40: Mar√≠a Julia a Medio Ambiente (November 8, 1991) something she attributed in a Clar√≠n interview at the time to the \\"trust the President has deposited in me.\\" Clar√≠n (November 19, 1991) Alsogaray's tenure at Environment Secretariat, which was elevated to a cabinet-level post by the president, was marked by a number of scandals of a policy nature. These included bid rigging for the refurbishment of the Haedo Palace (the headquarters of the secretariat); her handling of a serious, 1996 forest fire in the vicinity of Nahuel Huapi National Park; a 1999 flood in the humid northeast region; and, particularly, of a 1993 plan to decontaminate the Riachuelo (a heavily polluted waterway along Buenos Aires' industrial southside).Clar√≠n: Un s√≠mbolo del menemismo Alsogaray obtained a US$250 million loan from the IADB for the purpose; of this, however, US$150 million were destined to unrelated social projects, six million were lost in IADB fines, US$90 million remained unallocated, and only one million was used for the actual cleanup. P√°gina/12 Her own position within the right-wing UCeD√©, at the helm of which she succeeded her father in 1994, became jeopardized by a rivalry with the party's second-ranking figure, National Mortgage Bank Director Adelina D'Alessio de Viola.La Naci√≥n: Muri√≥ √Ålvaro Alsogaray Upon stepping down when President Menem left office in 1999, financial transactions in her name totaling over US$200 million came under scrutiny, and Alsogaray was ultimately convicted of misappropriation of public funds in 2004.Clar√≠n: Del esplendor de los noventa a la acumulaci√≥n de causas penales She was sentenced to three years in prison the following May and served 21 months, thus becoming the only Menem administration official to serve time in prison. Following a number of appeals and pursuant to her conviction, her Recoleta neighborhood townhouse was auctioned by a federal court in 2009.La Naci√≥n: Remataron el petit hotel de Mar√≠a Julia por casi un mill√≥n de d√≥lares She faced additional charges related to the Environment Ministry's handling of the 1996 forest fires, but was acquitted when the statute of limitations expired on these in April 2013. Alsogaray served a further two years in house arrest between 2014 and 2016 on charges of illicit enrichment. She faced a further charge - her eighth - of awarding an illegitimate contract worth US$30 million in 1990 to the Meller Company for ENTel telephone directories when other state agencies advised against doing so. Her health worsened, however, and she died of pancreatic cancer in the Los Arcos clinic in Palermo, Buenos Aires, in 2017. She was 74.

The approximately park is mostly surrounded by Delaware State Forest. It is in the Poconos and sits at an elevation of . The second growth forests in Promised Land State Park are made up of beech, maple, oak and hemlock trees. There are two lakes within the boundaries of the park. Promised Land State Park is north of Canadensis on Pennsylvania Route 390. Promised Land State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of State Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History The name is an ironic commentary of the immigrant residents in the 18th and 19th centuries who had been dazzled by promotional promises of the supposed wonders of the land they were buying, reflecting their later relative disappointment. Promised Land State Park was once the hunting grounds of the Lenape Indian tribe. Their land was part of the Province of Pennsylvania, established by King Charles II of England and under the leadership of William Penn. William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a colony where religious freedom was foundation of its establishment. The Shakers, a religious sect, from England migrated to the Thirteen Colonies and purchased some of the land in the Promised Land State Park area. It appears that they chose not to settle and instead sold off the land to lumbering operations that clear cut the land and sent the timber to the ship building docks in Philadelphia. The process of clear cutting the forests repeated itself several times until the land was acquired by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1902. The forestry department worked to re-establish the forests of the area. Promised Land State Park was opened to the public in 1905, becoming just the fourth state park in all of Pennsylvania. The spillway of a dam at Promised Land State Park. Many of the park facilities in use today were constructed during the Great Depression of the 1930s by the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The CCC was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to relieve the widespread unemployment what was brought about by the Depression. In exchange for a paycheck, food, and shelter, the men of the CCC worked to reclaim the forests. They built the roads and trails that cross the state forests. They also fought wild fires, planted trees, and built bridges on state roads. Whittaker Lodge and the Bear Wallow Cabins were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and 1987 for their architectural qualities and for their historical role in the park. Natural history Small waterfall in Promised Land State Park. Since the forests have been allowed to regrow at Promised Land State Park it has become a center of diverse wildlife and ecosystems. The land on which it sits has largely very rocky and shallow soil with nutrient-poor bogs and dark evergreen forests. The poor quality of the soil and the bogs are a remnant of the vast glaciers that covered Pennsylvania during the last ice age. As the glaciers receded they scraped the earth and left a glacial till at the surface above the bedrock. This rocky soil drains poorly thereby creating the bogs that are spread throughout the park. The evergreen trees attract a variety of birds including, the red breasted nuthatch, Blackburnian warbler and northern waterthrush. Salamanders and wood frogs are drawn to the bogs to breed during the springtime. While not all of the trees within the park are evergreen, many were before the lumber era. Some deciduous trees have grown at Promised Land State Park. These trees attract a different set of birds including the American redstart, Louisiana waterthrush and red-eyed vireo. American black bears are a common sight at Promised Land State Park. They are attracted to the wide variety of plants, grasses and berries that are common in the park. Visitors to the park are cautioned to be extremely careful when encountering a black bear. Bears are generally shy and will avoid human contact, but bears that have been fed by and have been accustomed to human contact can become dangerous. They are very fast, as fast as a thoroughbred, strong and nimble. Bears also have a strong sense of smell. For this reason all visitors are asked to firmly secure all food products brought into the park and never to leave them out in the open overnight. In addition to the bears, Promised Land State Park is also home to variety of other large woodland creatures. White tailed deer are a common sight in the park. Early morning visitors may come across groups of feeding wild turkeys. A wildlife observation deck is located on Lower Lake, from here visitors may see a variety of waterfowl species and even some bald eagles that have nested in the area within the last few years. Visitors are asked to not feed the wildlife. Feeding raccoons, squirrels and chipmunks may expose visitors to rabies. The feeding of Canada geese in the swimming area is discouraged due to the increased quantities of odorus fecal matter. Recreation Promised Land State Park is open year-round for recreational opportunities that include hiking, birding, fishing, swimming, boating, horseback riding, trail biking, camping, and ice skating. Promised Lake and Lower Lake are both popular fishing and ice fishing destinations. The common game fish are smallmouth and largemouth bass, catfish, crappie, pickerel, muskellunge, and yellow perch. Lower Lake is stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission with brook, rainbow and brown trout. All anglers are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Hunting is permitted at Promised Land State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are turkey, white-tailed deer, and black bear. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. There are of trails at Promised Land State Park and the nearby state forests that are open to hiking and in some locations, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, and mountain biking. The trails pass through a variety of habitats and give visitors an opportunity to observe a diverse wildlife population. Gas powered boats are prohibited on the lakes of Promised Land State Park. Electric powered and non powered boats must have a current registration with any state or a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. A concession is open on the shores of the lakes for renting canoes, kayaks and paddle boats. Promised Land State Park has a centrally-located picnic and beach area that is near Promised Land Lake in a woodland setting. The facilities include a sandy beach, boat launch, parking area, fresh water, picnic tables, reservable pavilions, garbage disposal containers, charcoal grills, a concession stand, a boat rental, a sand volleyball court, and restrooms with pay showers. Staying overnight Visitors to Promised Land State Park who wish to stay overnight have a choice of staying in one of four campgrounds or in rustic cabins that were built during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps. *Lower Lake Campground is on Lower Lake. It opens for the season in mid-April and closes in mid-December. The campground has flush toilets and showers with hot water. *Deerfield Campground is set back in a rocky forest. It is open Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. It does have flush toilets, but the nearest pay showers are in the picnic area. Deerfield campground is over 95 years old. During 2010 renovations, each campsite received a new table, fire ring and lantern holder. Also, some of the ground was leveled for easier access. *Pickerel Point Campground is on a peninsula on the southern end of Promised Land Lake. There are walk-in campsites situated at various points along the shore. It was renovated and re-opened on June 29, 2012. It has modern camping facilities, including bathhouses with green technology and the first sites with sewer hookup in all the state parks in Pennsylvania. *The Pines Campground is open Memorial Day through Labor Day. It is on the northwestern shore of Promised Land Lake. The campground does have flush toilets, but no showers.

Each cabin has a fireplace, refrigerator, modern shower and toilet outbuilding, beds and electricity. Masker Museum The park's Masker Museum features exhibits about the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and its work in the park. CCC exhibits include a barracks of beds, interactive stories, displays and artifacts. The museum also features natural history exhibits about the park's animals, plants and ecosystems. There are activities for children, a bird observation area of the outdoor feeding stations, and a native plant garden.

The book was originally to have been published by Canaveral Press. When Canaveral stopped adding titles to its catalog, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. took up the project. It was the first book the firm had published since Llana of Gathol, in 1948. I Am a Barbarian is one of only two historical novels Burroughs wrote. The other, The Outlaw of Torn, set in the England of King Henry III, was published in 1927. Plot introduction The story is pitched as a free translation of the memoirs of Britannicus, 25 years the slave of Caligula, emperor of Rome from AD 37 to 41 who is historically known for being insane. It treats a number of different supposed facets of Caligula's life, including his popular early acts as emperor and his descent into madness. Britannicus watches as Caligula begins falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates during a financial crisis caused by his own wasteful spending. A number of other desperate measures by Caligula are described in the book. In order to gain funds, Caligula asks the public to lend the state money. He levies taxes on lawsuits, marriage and prostitution, and begins auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows. The novel also includes the famous story that once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the crowd into the arena during intermission to be eaten by animals because there were no criminals to be prosecuted and he was bored.

Reaching in height, it bears large yellow flowers for much of the year. Grown as an ornamental plant, it has become a weed in several countries. Taxonomy This species was first described by Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl, who reported it grew on the banks of the Para√≠ba river. in 1827. William Hooker described a plant that he concluded had smaller deeper-yellow flowers than A. schottii in cultivation in Exeter as Allamanda neriifolia. This has since been considered a synonym of A. schottii. It is listed in Flora Brasiliensis by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. As well as bush allamanda, common names include Schott's common allamanda and oleander allamanda. Description Unlike many members of the genus, A. schottii is a shrub rather than a vine, growing to 1.5 to 3 m (5‚Äì10 ft) tall and around 2 m (6‚Äì8 ft) wide. The elliptic to obovate leaves are arranged in whorls of 3‚Äì5 or are subopposite along the stem, and measure 2‚Äì14 cm long and 1.1‚Äì4 cm wide. The large yellow flowers are terminal (i.e. appearing at the ends of branches), and can appear year-round but predominantly in spring. The spiny fruits appear mostly in summer. Distribution and habitat Allamanda schottii is found in the south and southeast of Brazil, in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Paran√° and Santa Catarina. Previously considered endemic to that country, it was reported from northeastern Argentina in 2013. In Brazil, it grows near or alongside bodies of water, often in wet areas, in open or closed forests. Allamanda schottii has become naturalised in Puerto Rico, the Galapagos Islands and Costa Rica. It is reported to have escaped from cultivation in Australia. Ecology fruit The flowers are pollinated by butterflies of the genus Phoebis, while bees and wasps also visit the flowers. The stems and leaves of Allamanda schottii contain a milky sap that is an irritant. The plant contains plumericin, which causes gastrointestinal irritation. Cultivation It is hardy to zones 10‚Äì11 and tolerant of dry spells. It grows best in rich, well-drained soil and benefits from regular pruning, becoming spindly otherwise. The cultivar Allamanda \\"Silver dwarf discovery\\" is less vigorous with silvery leaves.

It is a software application that facilitates the development of documentation, and the delivery of this documentation to the users of a product or system. It is typically implemented alongside other SAP products (such as SAP R/3) to provide user documentation on the use of those products, although technically it could be used as a stand-alone product to provide documentation for non-SAP systems or products. SAP Knowledge Warehouse provides a basic authoring environment, and relatively robust version control (including check-out/check-in functionality), but it is not really a 'knowledge management' product ‚Äî it is more a document repository. SAP Knowledge Warehouse allows documentation to be provided to users in three possible ways: #Via a web server that provides access to the entire documentation set #Via context-sensitive help from another SAP application #Through the creation of stand-alone Windows Help files One of the advantages of SAP Knowledge Warehouse is that it ships with a full set of SAP's official (but often poor) standard documentation for all transactions. Companies implementing Knowledge Warehouse can then modify (or 'enhance') only those documents for transactions they have customized, and users will be able to refer to the standard SAP documentation for everything else.
