The horizontal axis is wavelength in nm. Photopic vision is the vision of the eye under well-lit conditions (luminance level 10 to 108 cd/m2). In humans and many other animals, photopic vision allows color perception, mediated by cone cells, and a significantly higher visual acuity and temporal resolution than available with scotopic vision. The human eye uses three types of cones to sense light in three bands of color. The biological pigments of the cones have maximum absorption values at wavelengths of about 420 nm (blue), 534 nm (bluish-green), and 564 nm (yellowish-green). Their sensitivity ranges overlap to provide vision throughout the visible spectrum. The maximum efficacy is 683 lm/W at a wavelength of 555 nm (green). By definition, light at a frequency of hertz has a luminous efficacy of 683 lm/W. The wavelengths for when a person is in photopic vary with the intensity of light. For the blue-green region (500 nm), 50% of the light reaches the image point of the retina. Adaptation is much faster under photopic vision; it can occur in 5 minutes for photopic vision but it can take 30 minutes to transition from photopic to scotopic. Most older adult humans lose photopic spatial contrast sensitivity. Adults in their 70s require about three times more contrast to detect high spatial frequencies than adults in their 20s. The human eye uses scotopic vision under low-light conditions (luminance level 10‚àí6 to 10‚àí3.5 cd/m2), and mesopic vision in intermediate conditions (luminance level 10‚àí3 to 100.5 cd/m2).

Top: human; bottom: cat Scotopic vision is the vision of the eye under low-light levels. The term comes from Greek skotos, meaning \\"darkness\\", and -opia, meaning \\"a condition of sight\\". In the human eye, cone cells are nonfunctional in low visible light. Scotopic vision is produced exclusively through rod cells, which are most sensitive to wavelengths of around 498 nm (green‚Äìblue) and are insensitive to wavelengths longer than about 640 nm (reddish orange). This condition is called the Purkinje effect. Retinal Circuitry Of the two types of photoreceptors in the retina, rods dominate scotopic vision. This is caused by increased sensitivity of the photopigment molecule expressed in rods, as opposed to that in cones. Rods signal light increments to rod bipolar cells, which, unlike most bipolar cell types, do not form direct connections with ganglion cells - the output neuron of the retina. Instead, two types of amacrine cell - AII and A17 - allow lateral information flow from rod bipolar cells to cone bipolar cells, which in turn contact ganglion cells. Rod signals, mediated by amacrine cells, therefore dominate scotopic vision. Luminance Scotopic vision occurs at luminance levels of 10‚àí3http://faculty.washington.edu/sbuck/545ColorClass/PokornyCh2.1979b.PDF to 10‚àí6 cd/m2. Other species are not universally color blind in low-light conditions. The elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila elpenor) displays advanced color discrimination even in dim starlight. Mesopic vision occurs in intermediate lighting conditions (luminance level 10‚àí3 to 100.5 cd/m2) and is effectively a combination of scotopic and photopic vision. This gives inaccurate visual acuity and color discrimination. In normal light (luminance level 10 to 108 cd/m2), the vision of cone cells dominates and is photopic vision. There is good visual acuity (VA) and color discrimination. In scientific literature, one occasionally encounters the term scotopic lux which corresponds to photopic lux, but uses instead the scotopic visibility weighting function.Photobiology: The Science of Light and Life (2002), Lars Olof Bj√∂rn, p.43, Wavelength sensitivity The CIE 1951 scotopic luminosity function. The horizontal axis is wavelength in nm. The normal human observer's relative wavelength sensitivity will not change due to background illumination change under scotopic vision. The wavelength sensitivity is determined by the rhodopsin photopigment. This is a red pigment seen at the back of the eye in animals that have a white background to their eye called Tapetum lucidum. The pigment is not noticeable under photopic and mesopic conditions. The principle that the wavelength sensitivity does not change during scotopic vision led to the ability to detect two functional cone classes in individuals. If two cone classes are present, then their relative sensitivity will change the behavioral wavelength sensitivity. Therefore, experimentation can determine ‚Äúthe presence of two cone classes by measuring wavelength sensitivity on two different backgrounds and noting a change in the observer‚Äôs relative wavelength sensitivity.‚Äù For adaption to occur at very low levels, the human eye needs to have a large sample of light across the signal in order to get a reliable image. This leads to the human eye being unable to resolve high spatial frequencies in low light since the observer is spatially averaging the light signal. The behavior of the rhodopsin photopigment explains why the human eye cannot resolve lights with different spectral power distributions under low light. The reaction of this single photopigment will give the same quanta for 400 nm light and 700 nm light. Therefore, this photopigment only maps the rate of absorption and does not encode information about the relative spectral composition of the light. The maximum scotopic efficacy is 1700 lm/W at 507 nm (compared with 683 lm/W at 555 nm for maximum photopic efficacy). While the ratio between scotopic and photopic efficacies is only around 2.5 counted at peak sensitivity the ratio increases strongly below 500 nm. Another reason that vision is poor under scotopic vision is that rods, which are the only cells active under scotopic vision, converge to a smaller number of neurons in the retina. This many-to-one ratio leads to poor spatial frequency sensitivity.

He is best known as the West German Ambassador to Guatemala from 1968 until his assassination in 1970. The story of his assassination by Guatemalan guerillas was depicted in a 1970 book, Why Karl von Spreti Died, by Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski. Spreti was born in the Kapfing Castle near Landshut to an aristocratic family (his direct ancestor was Leo von Klenze). Like his forefather, Karl von Spreti studied architecture. He also joined the Bavarian People's Party. After his service in the Second World War German Army and a short period in Allied captivity, he settled in Lindau, where he continued his career as an architect and as a local politician for the Christian Social Union of Bavaria. In 1956, Spreti became West Germany's first ambassador to Luxembourg since the Second World War, and held that post until 1960, when he became the ambassador to Cuba (until 1963), then to Jordan (1963‚Äì1965) and to the Dominican Republic (between 1966 and 1968). Finally he was dispatched to Guatemala during the turbulent times of the Guatemalan Civil War. On 31 March 1970 he was kidnapped by Marxist‚ÄìLeninist FAR guerillas in Guatemala City and was murdered six days later. West Germany immediately severed diplomatic ties with Guatemala. Three days after Spreti's murder, an anti-communist death squad named Mano Blanca retaliated by assassinating the Communist politician C√©sar Montenegro Paniagua.

Population: History Founded in 1389 as Rogozhi, the town was later renamed Bogorodsk (lit. [a town] of the Mother of God) by a Catherine the Great's decree in 1781, when it was granted town status. Throughout the 19th century and for a good part of the 20th century, the town was a major textile center, processing cotton, silk, and wool. In 1930, the town was renamed Noginsk after Bolshevik Viktor Nogin. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Noginsk serves as the administrative center of Noginsky District.Resolution #123-PG As an administrative division, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated within Noginsky District as the City of Noginsk. As a municipal division, the City of Noginsk is incorporated within Noginsky Municipal District as Noginsk Urban Settlement.Law #82/2005-OZ Economy The city's industrial production is concentrated on ceramics (two major holdings), food (Biserovo fisheries and a fish factory in Noginsk), beverage (one of Russia's biggest beverage producers is located near Noginsk), and construction materials. Transportation Noginsk is a transport hub, being the intersection of the Nizhny Novgorod Highway, M7 (E22), and the Moscow Minor Ring road. Rapid transit development plans include possible construction of a direct high-speed railway line connecting Noginsk to the prospective Serp i Molot railway/metro terminal or Shosse Entuziastov metro station. Public transportation system consists of buses and trams. Noginsk's current commuters' travel to and from Moscow on the M7 Moscow-Nizhny-Novgorod Highway.

Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to and shape the environment, continuously contributing to landscape transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.Bal√©e, W.

Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, ethnographic interviews, and landscape reconstructions. History The discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches. Edward Smith Deevey, Jr. used the term in the 1960s to describe a methodology that had been in long development. Deevey wished to bring together the practices of \\"general ecology\\" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a \\"historical ecology\\" which relied on evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used radiocarbon dating to reconcile biologists‚Äô successions of plants and animals with the sequences of material culture and sites discovered by archaeologists. In the 1980s, members of the history department at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock organized a lecture series entitled \\"Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change\\"Bilsky, L. J., ed. (1980) Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change. Port Washington, NY: Kenniket Press. The authors noted the public‚Äôs concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures, personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.Moneyhon, C. H. (1980). Introduction. In Historical ecology: essays on environment and social change.ed. L. J. Bilsky, pp. 3-8. Port Washington, NY, Kenniket Press. The emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments: E.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central Pet√©n District of Guatemala to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.

In recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments: Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984‚Äìpresent) examines Massachusetts, USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records. Florida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990‚Äìpresent) researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the Florida Keys, USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.

Relations with other disciplines Manmade nature: In Idaho Falls, Idaho, these waterfalls replaced naturally occurring ones Historical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of environmental anthropology. Western scholars have known since the time of Plato that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the Great Chain of Being, or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.Glacken, C. (1956). Changing ideas of the habitable world. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's role in changing the phase of the Earth (pp 73). Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Interest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment. Anthropologist Roy Rappaport introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from systems ecology. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.Bal√©e, W. (2006). \\"The research program of historical ecology\\". Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 35, pp5.1-5.24. The revisions of anthropologist Eric Wolf and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over space and time. Landscapes in historical ecology In historical ecology, the landscape is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment. The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history.Barnes, T. G. (2000). Landscape, ecology and ecosystems management. Retrieved March 15, 2008, from Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky Web site: http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/for/for76/for76.htm Historical ecology revises the notion of the ecosystem and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers \\"landscape transformation\\" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time. The use of \\"landscape\\" instead of \\"ecosystem\\" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology. Geographer Carl O. Sauer Various individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words landskift, landscipe or landscaef refer to environments that have been altered by humans.Calder, W., 1981 Beyond the View - our changing landscapes. Inkata Press, Melbourne.Jackson, J.B., 1986, \\"The vernacular landscape\\", in Penning-Rowsell, E.C. & D. Lowenthal, Landscape Meanings and Values, Allen & Unwin, London, p 65-79. As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America.Olwig, K (2002). Landscape, nature, and the body politic. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press. Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also \\"forms of knowledge\\".Burns, Carol. 1991. On Site: Architectural Preoccupations. Princeton: Princeton Architectural Press. Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective. The idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer Carl Sauer. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper \\"The Morphology of Landscape\\" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted. The perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as landscape ecology. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities. Historical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts. Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major substrate modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes. Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous slash-and- burn horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time. Historical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests. The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism. Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment.Sluyter, Andrew (2002) Colonialism and Landscape: Postcolonial Theory and Applications. New York: Rowman & Littlefield. All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way. Human alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to industrialization. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like foragers and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole. Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.Sauer, C. 1969 (1925). \\"The morphology of landscape.\\" In J. Leighly (Ed.), Land and Life (pp 312-343). Berkeley: University of California Press. Human-mediated disturbance Man-made irrigation canal Homo sapiens have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others. Both destructive and at times constructive, anthropogenic fire is the most immediately visible human- mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured.Pyne, S. J. (1998). \\"Forged in fire: History, land, and anthropogenic fire\\". In W. Bal√©e (Ed.), Advances in Historical Ecology, (pp 64-103). Columbia University Press, New York. Humans have practiced controlled burns of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in North America and Australia), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of \\"ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions.\\" Biological invasions and the spread of pathogens and diseases are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare. In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion. Other mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include water management and soil management. In Mediterranean Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the Roman Empire. Cicero noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world. At present, fertilization yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils. Anthropogenic fire Anthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs. The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years. Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection. Broadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes. A swidden fire, an example of a controlled burn In addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources. In addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning. Of all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods. Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests. Biological invasions Lymantria dispar Biological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions. Invasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive. Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled. One example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate Eurasia; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an entomologist in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.Tobin, P.C. and A.M. Liebhold. \\"Gypsy Moth.\\" pp. 238-241 in: D. Simberloff and M. Rejmanek, eds., Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions, University of California Press, Berkeley, California Regardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion. Epidemic disease A San Tribesman: Those living in dry climates have fewer intestinal parasites. A clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human- mediated disturbance as humans are hosts for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as chronic diseases. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter- community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.Newson, L.A. (1998) \\"A historical-ecological perspective on epidemic disease.\\" In W. Balee (Ed.). Advances in historical ecology (pp 42-63). New York: Columbia University Press. Holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian Aborigines have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in pathogenic diversity. Transformation of waterways Historical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of western civilization. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil erosion and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. Landscapes, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation.Wallace, M. (1992). So shall you reap. New York: Doubleday. Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for agricultural or transportation usage. The evidence for past and present agricultural use of wetlands in Mesoamerica suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and waterway alteration. Pre-Columbian, indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.Whitmore, T. M. & Turner, B. L. II. (1992). \\"Landscapes of a cultivation in Mesoamerica on the eve of the conquest.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 82 (3), 402-425. Manaus, the largest city on the Amazon, as seen from a NASA satellite image, surrounded by the muddy Amazon River and the dark Rio Negro Historical ecologists view the Amazon basin landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The Amazon River has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its indigenous population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the Amazon are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.Raffles, H. The Amazon: a natural landscape? http://www.india-seminar.com/2000/486/486%20raffles.htm However, waterway transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic savanna peoples of the Bolivian Amazon built an anthropogenic landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish weirs in the savanna of Baures, Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn. Further evidence of waterway transformation is found in Igarap√© Guariba in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British naturalists Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarap√©- Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarap√© Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3 km) long across fields thick with tall papyrus grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of Amap√° was dramatically transformed. In general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the anthropogenic transformation of waterways. The Sumerians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in erosion which impacted the landscapes.Siemens, A. H. (1983, April). \\"Wetland agriculture in Pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica.\\" Geographical Review, 73 (2), 166-181 Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.Carlisle, B. & Smith, T. (2007, October 15). \\"Reviving a river.\\" Retrieved March 28, 2008, from Massachusetts Wetlands Restoration Program Web site: http://www.mass.gov/czm/coastlines/2006/ebbflow/river.htm The importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other ecological settings, as places where indigenous populations have dealt with the forces of nature. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an environment, not a society. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of anthropogenic transformation of both waterways and landscapes. Soil management Soil management, or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local biodiversity. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in topsoil. Salinization of the Euphrates River has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria.Erickson, C. & Bal√©e, W. (2006). In time and complexity in historical ecology: Studies in the neotropical lowlands (pp 7-12). New York: Columbia University Press. Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape. The case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or Terra preta, are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils. Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of charcoal in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity.Terra preta web site. School of geosciences and geography (Universit√§t Bayreuth). Retrieved on April 5, 2008, from It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed slash- and-char. In contrast to the commonly known slash-and-burn technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.Sington, D. (Director) (2002). Horizon: The secret of El Dorado [Videotape]. BBC Horizon Series. London: Dox Productions. Scorched land resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture Interest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade. Globally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‚Äòforest islands‚Äô in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees.Fairhead, J. & Leach, M. (1996). Misreading the African landscape: Society and ecology in a forest-savanna mosaic. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas. The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people. Applied historical ecology Historical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines. Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them. Historical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. Conservation biology recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. Restoration ecology restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area.Hunter, M.L., Gibbs, J.P. (2006) Fundamentals of Conservation Biology. 3rd ed. (pp 252-276). Malden, Massachusetts, Wiley- Blackwell. Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape. A tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples. The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production. Land managers no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government- sponsored agricultural purposes. The San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management.Grossinger, R.M., Striplen, C.J., Brewster, E., Beller, E.E., Askevold, R. 2007. \\"Historical landscape ecology of an urbanized California valley: wetlands and woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley.\\" Landscape Ecology. :103-120. A study of the wetlands of Elkhorn Slough near Monterey, California, sought to enhance conservation and restoration activities. By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s. The study further suggested using techniques that \\"imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats.\\" See also * Cultural ecology * Ecosystem * Ethnobiology * Human ecology * Landscape * Restoration ecology * Time geography References Category:Environmental history Category:Ecology Category:Anthropology ","title":"Historical ecology"},{"id":"1881098","title":"Is There Love in Space?"},{"id":"1881102","text":"Patrick Joseph Boland (January 6, 1880 ‚Äì May 18, 1942) was a United States representative for Pennsylvania 11th District.

Description Flowers The shrub is rounded and grows to in height. It sends out long stems which are red when new and fade to gray with age, the bark shredding in small flakes. The oppositely arranged leaves vary in size across individual plants but they are usually oval, long, smooth or serrated along the edges, and light green in color with a rough texture. The flowers are produced in clusters at the ends of long stems, with four white petals up to long and numerous yellow stamens. At the height of flowering, the plant is covered in a mass of blossoms. The flowers have a heavy, sweet scent similar to orange blossoms with a hint of pineapple. The fruit is a small hard capsule about a centimeter long with woody, pointed wings, containing many brown seeds. It is hardy from USDA zones 3 to 9. Ethnobotany Native American tribes used P. lewisii for numerous purposes. The hard wood was useful for making hunting and fishing tools, snowshoes, pipes, and furniture. The leaves and bark, which contain saponins, were mixed in water for use as a mild soap. \\"Native American used stems for making arrows,(USDA FS 1937) bows, combs, tobacco pipes, cradles and netting shuttles.\\" \\"Flowers are used in preparing perfumes and teas (Taylor 1972).\\" Cultivation Lewis' mock-orange prefers full sun to partial sun. It is drought-tolerant, will grow in poor soils and is suitable for xeriscaping. It provides a landscape with flashy flowers and a fruity scent. Hybrids Waterton Mockorange Philadelphus lewisii 'Waterton' The Waterton Mockorange Philadelphus lewisii 'Waterton' was hybridized by the Alberta Horticultural Research Station in Brooks, Alberta, Canada. It is drought-tolerant and is suitable for xeriscaping. It grows to 4‚Äì6 ft. (1.2-1.8 m) in height. It is hardy from USDA zones 3 to 9. In 1933 Augustus Griffin noted that this plant was growing in what is now Waterton Lakes National Park of Canada on the east side of the Rocky Mountains. Griffin (1883-1946) was a horticulture pioneer who collected, grew, crossed and tested plants at the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Headquarters Farm (now the Alberta Horticultural Research Station) in Brooks where he worked as irrigation engineer.

Before the city was founded by the Spanish colonizers, it is known as Kabaritan, named for the plant commonly seen in the area. With its wide plains, agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the city. It is part of the rice granary of the Philippines. Besides rice, the city also produces vegetables, fruits, and onions. It is now a leading producer of onions in the country. Every year the Tanduyong Festival is held in April coinciding with the annual fiesta to celebrate this. Tanduyong is a variety of onion grown in the area. The city has two pronounced seasons, rainy season from the months of May to November and the dry season in the remaining months.  History  San Jose, years before it became a town was a wilderness, a veritable hunting ground for wild animals by the inhabitants of its neighboring towns. The earliest inhabitants were known as Negritos (Baluga) headed by Kapitan Danding, a Negrito convert residing in Pinagcuartelan. These early inhabitants depended mostly on hunting and fishing for their livelihood. Some hunters from the neighboring towns found San Jose as a good place for settlers due to its wide and uncleared agricultural land. The first group of settlers made some clearings (kaingin) in the outskirts of the present town. Originally, San Jose was a part of the town Puncan, but later on, because of its nearness to Lupao, it was made a barrio of the latter. The early history of this town was coupled with the early history of Puncan and Lupao. Formerly, San Jose was known as the barrio of ‚ÄúKabaritan‚Äù derived from barit, an Ilocano word for a plant that belongs to the rattan family. ‚ÄúKabaritan‚Äù means the place where ‚Äúbarit‚Äù grows in abundance. On March 19, 1894, San Jose carved out its own course for on this date it became a full-fledged town, with an interim government headed by a Kapitan Municipal. ‚ÄúKabaritan‚Äù (now known as San Jose) was made an independent town from Lupao and was named after Saint Joseph, the patron saint of the place. Several years before the Philippine Revolution, the Ilocanos from Ilocos Region and some parts of Nueva Ecija, especially the towns of Santo Domingo, Mu√±oz and Lupao, as well as Pangasinenses of Pangasinan and northern Tarlac, came and plunged deep into the forest of Kabaritan, and cleared its wilderness. It was from this time then that the growth of the town really started. The progress of the town was through the enterprise, thrift, and hardihood of these settlers, headed by Canuto Ramos. During the Spanish Regime, the barrio of Kabaritan was a municipal district of Lupao, headed by a Teniente Absoluto. Later, when Kabaritan was declared a town in 1894, the head was changed to a Kapitan Municipal. The first man appointed as Kapitan Municipal was Canuto Ramos. He served from 1894 to 1898. One of his remarkable achievements was the Construction of an Irrigation System which was later taken over and enlarged by the government (now the Talavera River Irrigation System) which irrigates vast ricefields as far as the towns of Mu√±oz and Talavera.  American occupation and the Commonwealth of the Philippines When the revolution broke out and upon the surrender of the Spaniards in 1898, a revolutionary government was set up in San Jose. The town remained as such until the establishment of a civil government under the Americans in 1901. San Jose, under the American Regime, became a progressive town. Its inhabitants enjoyed more rights and privileges- political, economic, intellectual and religious than before. This was due to the establishment of various schools, churches, public buildings and the construction of roads and bridges, which made possible the fast progress of the town. From 1898 to 1900, a military government under the American Regime was established. Jose Cardenas was appointed Kapitan Municipal. During his term, the appointment of town officials, town planning, and the opening of new settlements was among his achievements. The second appointed Kapitan Municipal during the military government (1900‚Äì1901) was Celestino Javalde who continued the opening of new settlements and the construction of roads in the poblacion. When the civil government under the American Regime was established, Cornelio Ramos was appointed Kapitan Municipal. He continued the construction of roads in the poblacion and he also took a hand in the construction of irrigation canals leading to the different barrios of San Jose. In 1904, the Filipinos were given more rights and freedom in choosing the right man to take the reins of the government. An election was held. The first elected Municipal President was Crisanto Sanchez (1904‚Äì1906). Among his achievements was the construction of roads, the naming of the streets in the poblacion and the appointments of municipal officials. Again, (1906‚Äì1908) Celestino Javalde was elected Municipal President. With the help of his Vice-President and other municipal officials, he stressed land reforms, which paved the way for equal distribution of lands. The President-elect of 1908‚Äì1910, Valerio Escobar concentrated on the Construction of Roads from Sibut to San Agustin. He also founded the barrios of Santa Barbara and Kapisungan (now Bagong Sikat). Desiderio De Guzman had a chance to be elected in 1910 and served up to 1912. He had many achievements but among all these, he paid more attention to the improvements of records in the Poblacion. During the incumbency of Municipal President Agapito Kurameng, (1912‚Äì1916), he initiated the Construction of a Concrete Elementary School Building (Gabaldon building) which now comprised one of the central school buildings of the San Jose West Elementary School. The improvement of roads, expropriation of lots for the Municipal Hall and the Public Market were among his other achievements. The construction of the Municipal building and the construction of more roads leading to the barrios were launched by Gregorio Cadhit (1916‚Äì1919). He was re-elected to office from 1919 to 1922. During his term in 1919 to 1922, he initiated the construction of one of the buildings of the public market. As years went by, the town became so progressive that there was a need for more public improvements and building constructions for the welfare of the populace. As an answer to such demands, the newly elected President Rafael Rueda and Vice-President Estanislao Arquero with the help of other municipal officials put up a Puericulture Center and a Municipal Nursery during the period from 1922 to 1925. A second building for the public market was also constructed. Telephone lines connecting the poblacion with all the barrios were installed. A road to Kalbarito (now Palestina) was constructed and more improvement of roads was done. Another man in the person of Raymundo Eugenio was elected Municipal President of San Jose for the period from 1925 to 1928. A third building for the public market was constructed and more construction of roads, especially those leading to Andres Bonifacio, were put underway. In 1928‚Äì1931, Apolonio Pascual and Vice-President Victorino Villar were instrumental in putting up the fourth building for the public market and the municipal dispensary. More improvement of roads leading to the barrios was also done. Raymundo Eugenio was re-elected to the office. He served from 1931 to 1934 with Vice-President Ladislao Bunag. Raymundo Eugenio was called the road-building President of San Jose because of the untiring efforts that he exerted in the construction of many roads especially roads leading to the barrios of Bagong Bayan, Porais, Tondod, and Andres Bonifacio. Apolonio Pascual was re-elected for the 1934‚Äì1937 term. Dimas Tomas was the Vice President for the same term. Due to a change in the set-up in 1935, which was known as the commonwealth government, the heads of the municipal government came to be known and called Alcalde and Vice-Alcalde. Aside from the construction of more roads, the barrios of Patacla (now San Francisco) and A. Pascual were founded. The waterworks that provides the people of San Jose with drinking water was constructed and installed. The home economics building of San Jose Central School was also constructed. Alcalde Pedro Del Pilar and Vice-Alcalde Severino Bautista, under the Commonwealth government, established NARIC (National Rice and Corn) buying stations in the town. This was during their term of office from 1937 to 1940. They were re-elected for the 1940‚Äì1942 term. As a continuation of their policies, the improvement of roads was continued.  World War II  The outbreak of World War II was occurred in the country on December 8, 1941. San Jose became an evacuation center for evacuees from neighboring provinces especially those from Manila and suburbs. The tranquility of the place was marred by the bombings of two Japanese planes on December 23, 1941. The terror-stricken populace, who suffered heavy casualties fled to the remotest barrios of San Jose. An emergency government under the Commonwealth was established in the barrio of Porais with Basilio Duran as Mayor, appointed by the military forces of the Commonwealth Government. The emergency government existed for a short time, due to the arrival of the Japanese Imperial Forces on January 26, 1942. An emergency government, under the control of the Japanese Imperial Forces, was likewise established in Porais with Matias Bautista as Mayor. Due to the non-cooperation of the appointed Mayor Bautista, the Japanese army was obliged to appoint Mayor Anastacio Bascos. Engr. Casimiro Panajon succeeded him. Mayor Panajon was however murdered by the soldiers of the Japanese Garrison of this town for his non-collaboration with them and his guerilla activities. During the liberation, under the Commonwealth government, Anselmo Patacsil, Pedro Del Pilar and Basilio Duran were appointed in succession as Mayors of this town by the PCAU (Philippine Civil Affairs Unit) of the liberation forces. Each served for a short period of time in 1945‚Äì1946. They strived once more for the re-organization of the Municipal Government in cooperation with officials to coordinate the work of the PCAU. These persons helped in the establishment of emergency hospitals, the North Provincial High School and the re-opening of elementary schools.  Contemporary history  Independence of the Philippines from the United States = On July 4, 1946, the Philippines was granted its independence, there came about a change in our form of government, from Commonwealth to Republic. Under the Republic of the Philippines, Alfonso Villamar was elected Mayor with Paulino Margarejo as his Vice Mayor, (1947‚Äì1951). Among their achievements were the maintenance of evacuees, pacification campaign, rehabilitation of devastated government building, the establishment of a fire department and a municipal library and the improvement of roads. = Creation of Llanera = In 1954, the barrios of Bagumbayan (townsite), Andres Bonifacio, Caridad, San Mauricio (portion), Parang Manga (portion), Santa Barbara, Floridablanca, Gomez, San Francisco, and Victoria were separated to form the town of Llanera along with some territory from Talavera and Rizal. = Cityhood = On August 4, 1969, by virtue of Republic Act 6051, San Jose was converted into a city, making it as the third city in Nueva Ecija after Cabanatuan and Palayan.

Tanduyong is a variety of onion grown in the area. Every year, on the fourth Sunday of April, the people of San Jose celebrate the Tanduyong Festival. On festival day, the streets are filled with contingents of dancers outfitted in striking, multi-hued native costumes. Exotic rhythms of improvised musical instruments fill the air as the dancers gyrate and sway to the beat of life. Special activities included are a beauty contest, tourism, and trade fair, awarding ceremony and cultural shows. * Pagibang Damara: Hundreds of years ago in Central Luzon, landlords in the haciendas made the farmers build the ‚Äúdamara‚Äù, just before planting time of palay. A ‚Äúdamara‚Äù is a makeshift shelter made from kawayan (bamboo) and nipa, built at the center of ricefields as a protection from the sun's heat or from rain. Over the years, it has been a tradition that after all the harvests were safely brought home, the ‚Äúdamaras‚Äù are demolished (‚Äúginigiba‚Äù). People then start celebrating together for the bountiful harvest. In 2008, with rice as its primary produce, San Jose City conducted its First Rice Festival, adopting the century ‚Äì old festive tradition. However, unlike in older days, wherein people celebrate separately in their barangays, San Jose City now celebrates as one big family. The after-harvest celebration has become a multi-sectoral effort, collectively prepared, funded out of contributions (from the public and private sector), and participated in by all sections of the city. Since 2015, Pagibang Damara festival features the best Pancit Kanin contest. Pansit Kanin is one of the most common menus among carinderias in San Jose City.

He made numerous trips to Egypt and the Sudan on behalf of the British Museum to buy antiquities, and helped it build its collection of cuneiform tablets, manuscripts, and papyri. He published many books on Egyptology, helping to bring the findings to larger audiences. In 1920, he was knighted for his service to Egyptology and the British Museum. Earlier life E. A. Wallis Budge was born in 1857 in Bodmin, Cornwall, to Mary Ann Budge, a young woman whose father was a waiter in a Bodmin hotel. Budge's father has never been identified. Budge left Cornwall as a boy, and eventually came to live with his maternal aunt and grandmother in London. Budge became interested in languages before he was ten years old, but left school at the age of twelve in 1869 to work as a clerk at the retail firm of W.H. Smith, which sold books, stationery and related products. In his spare time, he studied Biblical Hebrew and Syriac with the aid of a volunteer tutor named Charles Seeger. Budge became interested in learning the ancient Assyrian language in 1872, when he also began to spend time in the British Museum. Budge's tutor introduced him to the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities, the pioneer Egyptologist Samuel Birch, and Birch's assistant, the Assyriologist George Smith. Smith helped Budge occasionally with his Assyrian. Birch allowed the youth to study cuneiform tablets in his office and obtained books for him from the British Library of Middle Eastern travel and adventure, such as Austen Henry Layard's Nineveh and Its Remains. From 1869 to 1878, Budge spent his free time studying Assyrian, and during these years, often spent his lunch break studying at St. Paul's Cathedral. John Stainer, the organist of St. Paul's, noticed Budge's hard work, and met the youth. He wanted to help the working-class boy realize his dream of becoming a scholar. Stainer contacted W.H. Smith, a Conservative Member of Parliament, and the former Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, and asked them to help his young friend. Both Smith and Gladstone agreed to help Stainer to raise money for Budge to attend the University of Cambridge. Budge studied at Cambridge from 1878 to 1883. His subjects included Semitic languages: Hebrew, Syriac, Ge'ez and Arabic; he continued to study Assyrian independently. Budge worked closely during these years with William Wright, a noted scholar of Semitic languages, among others. In 1883 he married Dora Helen Emerson, who died in 1926. Career at the British Museum Illustration by Budge from Egyptian Ideas Of The Future Life, published 1908 Budge entered the British Museum in 1883 in the recently renamed Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities. Initially appointed to the Assyrian section, he soon transferred to the Egyptian section. He studied the Egyptian language with Samuel Birch until the latter's death in 1885. Budge continued to study ancient Egyptian with the new Keeper, Peter le Page Renouf, until the latter's retirement in 1891. Between 1886 and 1891, Budge was assigned by the British Museum to investigate why cuneiform tablets from British Museum sites in Iraq, which were to be guarded by local agents of the Museum, were showing up in the collections of London antiquities dealers. The British Museum was purchasing these collections of what were their \\"own\\" tablets at inflated London market rates. Edward Bond, the Principal Librarian of the Museum, wanted Budge to find the source of the leaks and to seal it. Bond also wanted Budge to establish ties to Iraqi antiquities dealers in order to buy available materials at the reduced local prices, in comparison to those in London. Budge also travelled to Istanbul during these years to obtain a permit from the Ottoman Empire government to reopen the Museum's excavations at these Iraqi sites. The Museum archaeologists believed that excavations would reveal more tablets. During his years in the British Museum, Budge also sought to establish ties with local antiquities dealers in Egypt and Iraq so that the Museum could buy antiquities from them, and avoid the uncertainty and cost of excavating. This was a 19th-century approach to building a museum collection, and it was changed markedly by more rigorous archaeological practices, technology and cumulative knowledge about assessing artefacts in place. Budge returned from his many missions to Egypt and Iraq with large collections of cuneiform tablets; Syriac, Coptic and Greek manuscripts; as well as significant collections of hieroglyphic papyri. Perhaps his most famous acquisitions from this time were the Papyrus of Ani, a Book of the Dead; a copy of Aristotle's lost Constitution of Athens, and the Amarna letters. Budge's prolific and well-planned acquisitions gave the British Museum arguably the best Ancient Near East collections in the world, at a time when European museums were competing to build such collections. In 1900 the Assyriologist Archibald Sayce said to Budge, \\"What a revolution you have effected in the Oriental Department of the Museum! It is now a veritable history of civilization in a series of object lessons[.]\\" Budge became Assistant Keeper in his department after Renouf retired in 1891, and was confirmed as Keeper in 1894. He held this position until 1924, specializing in Egyptology. Budge and collectors for other museums of Europe regarded having the best collection of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities in the world as a matter of national pride, and there was tremendous competition for such antiquities among them. Museum officials and their local agents smuggled antiquities in diplomatic pouches, bribed customs officials, or simply went to friends or countrymen in the Egyptian Service of Antiquities to ask them to pass their cases of antiquities unopened. During his tenure as Keeper, Budge was noted for his kindness and patience in teaching young visitors to the British Museum. Budge's tenure was not without controversy. In 1893 he was sued in the high court by Hormuzd Rassam for both slander and libel. Budge had written that Rassam had used his relatives to smuggle antiquities out of Nineveh and had sent only \\"rubbish\\" to the British Museum. The elderly Rassam was upset by these accusations, and when he challenged Budge, he received a partial apology that a later court considered \\"ungentlemanly\\". Rassam was supported by the judge but not the jury. After Rassam's death, it was alleged that, while Rassam had made most of the discoveries of antiquities, credit was taken by the staff of the British Museum, notably Austen Henry Layard. Literary and social career Budge was also a prolific author, and he is especially remembered today for his works on ancient Egyptian religion and his hieroglyphic primers. Budge argued that the religion of Osiris had emerged from an indigenous African people: > \\"There is no doubt\\", he said of Egyptian religions in Osiris and the > Egyptian Resurrection (1911), \\"that the beliefs examined herein are of > indigenous origin, Nilotic or S√ªd√¢n√Æ in the broadest signification of the > word, and I have endeavoured to explain those which cannot be elucidated in > any other way, by the evidence which is afforded by the Religions of the > modern peoples who live on the great rivers of East, West, and Central > Africa . . . Now, if we examine the Religions of modern African peoples, we > find that the beliefs underlying them are almost identical with those > Ancient Egyptian ones described above. As they are not derived from the > Egyptians, it follows that they are the natural product of the religious > mind of the natives of certain parts of Africa, which is the same in all > periods.\\" Budge's contention that the religion of the Egyptians was derived from similar religions of the people of northeastern and central Africa was regarded as impossible by his colleagues. At the time, all but a few scholars followed Flinders Petrie in his theory that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading \\"Dynastic Race,\\" which had conquered Egypt in late prehistory. Budge's works were widely read by the educated public and among those seeking comparative ethnological data, including James Frazer. He incorporated some of Budge's ideas on Osiris into his ever-growing work on comparative religion, The Golden Bough. Though Budge's books remain widely available, since his day both translation and dating accuracy have improved, leading to significant revisions. The common writing style of his era‚Äîa lack of clear distinction between opinion and incontrovertible fact‚Äîis no longer acceptable in scholarly works. According to Egyptologist James Peter Allen, Budge's books \\"were not too reliable when they first appeared and are now woefully outdated.\\" Budge was also interested in the paranormal, and believed in spirits and hauntings. Budge had a number of friends in the Ghost Club (British Library, Manuscript Collections, Ghost Club Archives), a group in London committed to the study of alternative religions and the spirit world. He told his many friends stories of hauntings and other uncanny experiences. Many people in his day who were involved with the occult and spiritualism after losing their faith in Christianity were dedicated to Budge's works, particularly his translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Such writers as the poet William Butler Yeats and James Joyce studied and were influenced by this work of ancient religion. Budge's works on Egyptian religion have remained consistently in print since they entered the public domain. Budge was a member of the literary and open-minded Savile Club in London, proposed by his friend H. Rider Haggard in 1889, and accepted in 1891. He was a much sought-after dinner guest in London, his humorous stories and anecdotes being famous in his circle. He enjoyed the company of the well-born, many of whom he met when they brought to the British Museum the scarabs and statuettes they had purchased while on holiday in Egypt. Budge never lacked for an invitation to a country house in the summer or to a fashionable townhouse during the London season. Later years Budge was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours for his distinguished contributions to Colonial Egyptology and the British Museum. In the same year he published his sprawling autobiography, By Nile and Tigris. He retired from the British Museum in 1924, and lived until 1934. He continued to write and published several books; his last work was From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt (1934). Lady Wallis Budge Junior Research Fellowship In his will, in remembrance of his wife, Budge established and endowed the Lady Wallis Budge Junior Research Fellowships and graduate scholarships at Cambridge and Oxford universities. These continue to support young Egyptologists at the beginning of their research careers. In popular culture * The novelist H. Rider Haggard dedicated his novel Morning Star (1910) to Budge. *Budge is mentioned briefly in the movie Stargate as the author of several outdated books on Egyptian hieroglyphs. *Budge is frequently mentioned, though he appears \\"on-stage\\" only once, in the Amelia Peabody series of mystery novels by \\"Elizabeth Peters\\" (Egyptologist Dr. Barbara Mertz). In Amelia's husband Emerson's dogmatic opinion, Budge is a poor archaeologist and an unscrupulous plunderer of Egypt. The same novels also refer to Flinders Petrie, who never appears on-stage, as a scrupulous, scientific archaeologist and rival to Emerson. Dr. Mertz refers in passing to some of Petrie's eccentric personal habits. *The children's writer E. Nesbit dedicated her classic novel The Story of the Amulet (1906) to Budge. *Budge appeared as a major character in the 2006 History Channel docudrama The Egyptian Book of the Dead. *The writer William S. Burroughs drew on many of Budge's works as source material, in particular for the 1987 novel in his Cities trilogy, The Western Lands.

Created in 1996, charitable choice allows government officials to purchase services from religious providers using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Welfare-to-Work, and Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) funds. In late 2000, charitable choice was included in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration‚Äôs (SAMHSA) block grant. Principles Charitable Choice has gained support from policymakers due to its unique approach to social services. In this faith-based model or the so-called holistic relief (also known as whole person ministry), a religious organization addresses the needs of the poor both on the material and spiritual levels. The element of faith in the social service framework does not necessarily mean a focus on specific religious program or initiatives based on a specific religious denomination. Proponents of the concept explain that instead, it pertains to a broad religious framework wherein all religious forms are included in providing social support.Bartkowski & Regis, p. 162. According to the Department of Health and Human Services,\\"What is Charitable Choice?,\\" Department of Health and Human Services, 2004-JUL-26, at: https://www.hhs.gov/fbci/choice.html Charitable Choice rests on four major principles: A Level Playing Field Faith-based providers are eligible to provide federally-funded social services on the same basis as any other providers, neither excluded nor included because they are religious, too religious or of a different religion. Respect for Allies The religious character of faith-based providers is protected by allowing them to retain control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of their religious beliefs. Neither federal nor state government can require a religious provider to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, scripture or other symbols in order to be a program participant. Protecting Clients In regard to rendering assistance, religious organization shall not discriminate against an individual on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or refusal to actively participate in a religious practice. If an individual objects to the religious character of a program, a secular alternative must be provided. Church-State Separation All government funds must be used to fulfill the public social service goals, and no direct government funding can be diverted to inherently religious activities such as worship, sectarian instruction, and proselytization. Controversy Some are concerned that charitable choice blurs the separation of church and state and argue that federal financial support of faith-based organizations creates an opportunity for abuse and a potential for funds to flow in a biased way towards groups affiliated with one particular denomination or religious tradition. Specifically, critics argue that it violates the religion clause of the First Amendment. Some examples of lawsuits that raised this issue were the cases that challenged the constitutionality of the Charitable Choice programs in Texas and Kentucky. In addition, some religious organization such as the Interfaith Alliance are concerned about the impact of charitable choice \\"on the vitality of the prophetic voice of faith, the integrity of religious autonomy, excessive government entanglement in the affairs of religious institutions and the overarching temptation to abuse religion and manipulate faith to achieve political power.\\" On the other hand, the U.S. Supreme Court has increasingly taken a permissive position with respect to the constitutionality of the Charitable Choice. In several decisions, it established a relaxation of the constraints imposed and assumptions made with respect to public funding of the secular initiatives of religious organizations.

The story focuses on Maki Aikawa, an ex-gymnast turned street fighter. The manga was serialized in the Hakusensha magazine Young Animal from 1997 to 2006 and has been collected into 28 tank≈çbon (bound volumes). A 27-episode anime adaptation of the manga's 16 volumes was directed by Daisuke Nishio and produced by Toei Animation, Nippon TV and VAP. The anime was licensed in North America through a partnership between Toei and Geneon USA. However, only a few episodes of the series were released in the region before the cancellation of the deal, which was due to the poor quality and large number of DVD returns to Geneon. Plot Behind the scenes of the hustle and bustle of everyday life in Tokyo, there exist many people who strive to become stronger by competing against each other in street fights. The main protagonist is Maki Aikawa, a 16-year- old high school student. A former gymnast, Maki adapts her skills to a different way of life ‚Äî street fighting. The only thing that truly makes her feel alive is the rush and pressure experienced while fighting. With amazing power and grace, she fights opponent after opponent, repeatedly demonstrating the gymnastic talent that earns her her street name, \\"Airmaster\\". Eventually, Maki is exposed to a fighting league of sorts, known as the Fukamichi Rankings. The Fukamichi Rankings consist of the world's greatest street fighters and martial artists. The Fukamichi Ranking fights are held for various reasons. Firstly, many fighters wish to test themselves, achieving the highest rank possible and stretching themselves to their physical limits. However, there is also a corporate side to the Fukamichi rankings, with many viewers around the world eager to watch the brutal yet awe-inspiring showdowns. Each Fukamichi ranker is paid a respective amount for winning within their fight. Maki, seeking to quench her thirst for that pressure or buzz she experiences only through fighting and to find her place within this world, scales the Fukamichi Rankings, clashing with the world's greatest fighting prodigies.  Characters  * Formerly a gymnast who trained under her now-deceased mother, Maki uses her acrobatic skill in her fighting style to increase freedom of movement. Her attacks combine vertiginous leaps and somersaults with the fearsome, furious power of her kicks and throws. Maki has the ability to replicate most nearly any move she gets hit with or sees, and when in combat possesses an awe-inspiring resilience, presence, and strength of will. Since her relationship with her father is conflicted, she lives alone. Maki seems to enjoy street fighting for the 'rush' rather than any sense of revenge or honor. When not fighting, Maki tends to stick out in a crowd due to her unusual height (6 feet, which is very tall for a Japanese girl) and appearance, preferring to follow her quartet of friends quietly. Her younger sister comments that Maki is somewhat simpleminded. Maki is reluctant to deal with several people obsessed with her. She becomes vulnerable to attack, for a moment, when she gets approached in any romantic way, especially with Julietta Sakamoto. Her signature moves are the \\"Air Spin Driver\\" and later, the \\" Air Cutter\\"; she is later shown to master the art of Air Flow. Maki is voiced by Romi Park. * Yuu is a friend of Maki and shares some of the same interest as Renge. She is a fan of the singer Uzumi Mika. She is taking karate lessons and also has a crush on Shinnosuke, and sometimes she fights with Michiru about Shinnosuke. Yuu is voiced by Mariko Suzuki. * Michiru is a friend of Maki. She also has a crush on Shinnosuke, but becomes upset when he admits his love for Maki. She is a fan of the model Nono Rakuko. Yuu and Michiru make a great duo and are seldom seen apart. Michiru is voiced by Masumi Asano. * One of Maki's shyer friends, who goes to a presumably rich, private school. has ridiculously exaggerated, large 46M breasts that are still growing, they are normally used as a source of humor rather than fan service, and she is extremely self conscious about her well-endowed figure. In addition to this, Mina is hopelessly in love with Maki, who is not sure how to handle the matter, making this the main reason her friends make fun of her. However, like Maki, she has her share of admirers as well; including Reiishi Mishima and many members of Kinjirou's Black Suit gang. Mina's favorite food is Belgian chocolate cake, she has been a fan of Nanjou Remon's novels since she was a child and her measurements are claimed by herself to be 105-61-92. Mina is voiced by Yukana. * The group's extremely short friend. Renge has a penchant for eating obsessively, yet she is always thin (sometimes when she eats a lot, she is shown to have a belly). Renge is the stereotypical overexcited kid with a tendency to whine, but she serves as a cheering squad. She later acquires a kitten that she carries with her most of the time. She also has \\"psychic\\" powers. Her character was not well received by fans because of her annoying voice. Renge is voiced by Tomoko Kaneda. * Maki's estranged father. Maki was born when he was 15, which would make him around 31 years old. He is a four-time pro-fighting champion. He runs a dojo and raises Maki's half-sister, Miori. He gets beaten by Sakamoto, but they become friends later on. Shiro is voiced by Toshio Furukawa. * Maki's somewhat bratty younger half- sister. Her martial-artist father is the same as Maki's, so she shares some of her older sister's fighting ability, but none of her gravity-defying gymnastic skill, which Maki evidently got from her mother. In her first appearance, she suddenly attacks Maki. She is about the same height as Renge, though she is younger. She decides to move in with Maki. She later idolizes Sanpagita Kai. Miori is voiced by Yukiko Hirotsu. * A wanna-be future model (later a female wrestler) with an obsessive one-sided rivalry with Maki. She later becomes a moderately good fighter, and accomplishes things by sheer force of will and determination. She is loud and over-dramatic, and during extended fights is essentially a Berserker powered by her own rage, and she will not admit defeat unless violently knocked out. A running gag in the show is how most characters refer to her by her full name in a dramatic fashion, probably due to her tendency to do the same. When enraged, her appearance has been compared to Devilman. Due to a brutal assault she suffered in highschool, she is deaf in her right ear. Kaori is voiced by Mika Doi. * A scruffy but handsome ghost writer who becomes obsessed with Maki, while the latter is totally uninterested in him and finds his behavior very creepy. He is a smooth talker but prone to overly aggressive declarations of love, sometimes bordering on assault, towards Maki, who he calls \\"My Jenny\\" after a woman whose picture he was obsessed with as a child. He tends to always kiss her and declare his love for her when they are together, even during their fights, throwing her off balance. This is usually done for comedic effect. He has three women who are head over heels for him: Uzumi Mika (a famous singer), Nono Rakuko (a famous model), and Nanjou Remon (a famous novelist). He ignores them all since he is fixated on marrying Maki and making her move in with him. Maki is physically capable of beating him down in his insane-like \\"distracted\\" state of mind ; however, she did have a hard time with him at first. He can take a huge beating and still be able to fight. In a fight with another opponent he once had both his legs and one of his arms broken but he was still able to fight. Sakamoto usually only fights with extremely fast and devastating kicks. He usually leaves his hands in his pockets while fighting even though he has a powerful punch. It is said his strength is legendary on the street. He becomes rank seven in the Fukamichi Rankings after defeating Nobuhiko Fukamichi in a single kick. Julietta is voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi. * Leader of the League of Black-suited Gentlemen. He claims to hate women yet he likes Maki because he thinks she is different. He is a good fighter and has great punching power. He once took down a bear with one punch. He has a technique where he can create an afterimage of himself attacking so the opponent will be fooled into acting prematurely. He had his first kiss stolen by one of his male subordinates, Nagato the Long Fist, while Nagato was fighting Fukamichi. Kinjiro is ranked ninth within the Fukamichi rankings. Kinjiro is voiced by Kentaro Ito. * Though she is not initially involved in the street-fighting tournament Maki joins, Sampaguita Kai was one of her most difficult opponents. Using a similar fighting style to Maki, Kai faces her in a tag-team match during a women's wrestling tournament. She becomes obsessed, like a number of Maki's earlier opponents, with beating Maki. She's the younger sister of Lucha Master, who taught her how to fight ever since she was young. Kai gained the ninth rank within the Fukamichi Rankings after beating Shun Yashiki, however she is narrowly defeated by Kinjiro Kitaeda, which leaves her ranked ten. Kai's signature moves are the \\"Izakaya Bomber\\" and the \\"Ultimate Sky Screwbomb\\", she learns the former from her former mentor/wrestling partner Hayase Mio and the latter is of her own creation. Kai is voiced by Michie Ishizuka. * A guy who challenges Maki early on, but later temporarily joins the group. He seems to have a crush on Maki. He fights with a long staff that can separate into a sansetsukon. He has been training with since age of five. He later gets into a fight with Reiichi, and gets the upper hand on him, but Tsukio saves Reiichi and overwhelms Shinnosuke with his Jack Hammer punch. He seems to know kung fu, but his style was not specified in the anime. Voiced by Tomokazu Seki. * Lucha Master is, as the name implies, a masterful wrestler, styled after Mexican Luchadores. He always wears a mask, and he is the first major challenge Maki faces. He is one of only three characters who can use a similar sort of aerial combat to Maki. He is the older brother of Sanpaguita Kai, another character with a similar fighting style. Lucha Master is ranked twenty-first within the Fukamichi Rankings. Lucha Master is voiced by Unsh≈ç Ishizuka. * Another early opponent. He is a construction worker who has a furious punch similar to a jackhammer, but is not as fast as some of the other street fighters. Maki often overlooks him, especially since, after his first appearance, Lucha Master quickly showed up, and this makes him furious. Tsukio is ranked twenty-second within the Fukamichi rankings. Tsukio is voiced by Kihachiro Uemura. * A sort of hanger-on to Tsukio Taketsugu, Reiichi is sometimes a coward and a klutz. Though he could only fight well with a bike, using it like it is part of his own body, he is still only a moderately skilled street fighter. He also has a crush on Mina Nakanotani and often fantasizes about being her hero; when faced with the actual necessity of saving her from Kinjiro's mob he fights bravely but is eventually overwhelmed and is forced to yield leadership to stronger fighters. Reiichi is voiced by Daisuke Sakaguchi * The man who runs the street fighting tournament, and who gave his name to the ranking system (Fukamichi Rankings). He decides who is qualified to be in the Tournament rankings. He watches the fights and has videos of them streamed to his laptop, which he then broadcasts all over the world on the internet. He does not participate in the fights, but he has been shown to be extremely strong and fast. He has a younger brother (Nobuhiko Fukamichi), who participates in the competition using weaponized fireworks. He has a hobby of critiquing restaurants and posting the results on the internet. In the final episode, Fukamichi reveals that he created the ranks to gather warriors who could defeat Eternal, the first ranked fighter. Voiced by Takehito Koyasu. * Tsukio's younger cousin. Originally ninth place in the Fukamichi Tournament, but after losing his rank to Kai, he decided to beat the eighth place holder. He is a ki manipulator. He has a technique where he uses his ki to create an osmotic punch, which strongly pressures the insides of an opponent's body resulting in a loss of a massive amount of liquid within their body, rendering them incapacitated. Since he uses his ki for this technique, he can only use it a certain number of times until he rests to build up his ki again. He teaches this technique to Kaori Sakiyama. Voiced by Kazunari Tanaka. * is ranked number four and has been labeled \\"The Strongest Woman\\" in the Fukamichi rankings. Her full fighting style emphasizes on counterattacks as well as cutting and stabbing techniques with her hands. She is the second person to ever beat Maki in a fight. She starts her fight as a calm and collected individual, though Maki sees through her and knows that she likes to fight. It is implied that she was killed during her fight with Eternal, as she was knocked unconscious by him slamming her into the ground and was thus incapable of escaping the building collapsing from the sheer force of Maki and Eternal's final attacks. * The third place holder in the Fukamichi Rankings. Konishi believes he has attained perfection and specializes in grappling and submission techniques. He is shown to easily beat Shiro Saeki who is also proficient in submission techniques, and fight on par with and eventually defeat Sakamoto. Voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi * The first place holder in the Fukamichi ranking, he seems to be one of many \\"Eternals\\" throughout time and is followed by an enigmatic female medium capable of contacting them. Eternal is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, fighters in the world, capable of leveling an entire building in one punch. He is defeated only by the combined efforts of Maki and Yuki, both of whom he decimated in a one-on-one fight. He disappears after the building he and Maki fought in collapses, implying he was either killed by the collapse or left the building before Maki woke up. Media=Manga Air Master was serialized in the Hakusensha magazine Young Animal from 1997 to 2006. The individual chapters have been collected into 28 tank≈çbon, which were published between July 29, 1997, to May 29, 2006. Anime An anime adaptation of Air Master was produced by Nippon Television, VAP and Toei Animation, and originally aired on NTV from April 1 to September 23, 2003. It was directed by Daisuke Nishio, with Michiko Yokote handling series composition, Yoshihiko Umakoshi designing the characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. At the time the adaptation was produced, the original story had not yet been finished, so it has its own unique twists, including changes to the endgame storyline. The episodes were compiled onto nine separate DVDs, which were released in Japan by VAP between July 24, 2003, and March 24, 2004. Each DVD contains three episodes and a bonus yonkoma by manga author Yokusaru Shibata. Geneon Entertainment had signed an agreement with Toei to license an English-dubbed version of the anime in the United States and Canada. It was also announced that the series would air on the Canadian cable channel Razer, though it never earned a timeslot and was cancelled before broadcast. Ultimately only three DVDs of Air Master were released in North America, with the fourth and fifth being solicited but cancelled due to an abrupt termination of partnership between the two companies. Region 1 DVDs for the anime, along with two other Toei titles, received very little advertising and suffered from poor quality, resulting in dismal sales and a large number of returns to Geneon. In 2009, Funimation gained the rights to Air Master and began streaming it on the company's official website. The anime was also streamed on Joost. =Episodes References  External links  * Official Air Master website (Toei Animation) * Official Air Master website (VAP) * Category:1997 manga Category:2003 anime television series Category:Action anime and manga Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Funimation Category:Geneon USA Category:Hakusensha franchises Category:Hakusensha manga Category:Manga adapted into television series Category:Martial arts anime and manga Category:Nippon TV original programming Category:Seinen manga Category:Toei Animation television ","title":"Air Master"},{"id":"1881167","text":"The stellate ganglion (or cervicothoracic ganglion) is a sympathetic ganglion formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical ganglion and the first thoracic ganglion, which exists in 80% of cases. Sometimes the second and the third thoracic ganglia are included in this fusion. Stellate ganglion is relatively big (10‚Äì12 x 8‚Äì20 mm) compared to much smaller thoracic, lumbar and sacral ganglia and it is polygonal in shape (L. stellatum = star-shaped). Stellate ganglion is located at the level of C7, anterior to the transverse process of C7 and the neck of the first rib, superior to the cervical pleura and just below the subclavian artery. It is superiorly covered by the prevertebral lamina of the cervical fascia and anteriorly in relation with common carotid artery, subclavian artery and the beginning of vertebral artery which sometimes leaves a groove at the apex of this ganglion (this groove can sometimes even separate the stellate ganglion into so called vertebral ganglion). Relations of the apex of the stellate ganglion: * covered by the endothoracic fascia and parietal pleura * right stellate ganglion is in relation with right brachiocephalic vein anteriorly * right stellate ganglion is in relation with sternal part of subclavian artery anteriorly * laterally: first intercostal artery * medially: longus colli muscle Clinical significance The stellate ganglia may be cut in order to decrease the symptoms exhibited by Raynaud's phenomenon and hyperhydrosis (extreme sweating) of the hands. Injection of local anesthetics near the stellate ganglion can sometimes mitigate the symptoms of sympathetically mediated pain such as complex regional pain syndrome type I (reflex sympathetic dystrophy), and PTSD. Injection is often given near the Chassaignac's Tubercle (anterior tubercle of transverse process of C6) due to this being an important landmark lateral to the cricoid cartilage. It is thought that anesthetic is spread along the paravertebral muscles to the stellate ganglion. Stellate ganglion block also shows great potential as a means of reducing the number of hot flushes and night awakenings suffered by breast cancer survivors and women experiencing extreme menopause.Lancet, 2008 There has been interest in using Stellate Ganglion blocks to treat PTSD, particularly among combat veterans. A 2017 review of the evidence from the VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program found that while the procedure had been reported as effective in unblinded case series, the evidence from randomized controlled trials remained inconclusive. Nerve fibers from the Stellate Ganglion go up the superior cervical sympathetic chain and into the Pterygopalatine (Sphenopalatine) Ganglion (SPG). SPG blocks have been shown to reduce anxiety, headaches, migraines, cancer pain and other disorders. Self-administration of SPG blocks (SASPGB) is another method of delivering sphenopalatine blockade and indirect stellate ganglion blockade. Complications associated with a stellate ganglion block include Horner's syndrome, accidental intra-arterial or intravenous injection, difficulty swallowing, vocal cord paralysis, epidural spread of local anaesthetic, and pneumothorax. Blunt needling of the stellate ganglion with an acupuncture needle is used in traditional Chinese medicine to decrease sympathetically mediated symptoms as well. Block of the stellate ganglion has also been explored in coronary artery bypass surgery, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder. Left stellectomy is a treatment strategy in prolonged QT syndrome because activity of the stellate ganglia drives prolonged QT. However, this therapy is only offered to patients who are already on a beta blocker and experience frequent shocks from an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD), because stellectomy causes Horner's syndrome. Anatomy The stellate ganglion lies in front of the neck of the first rib. The vertebral artery lies anterior to the ganglion as it has just originated from the subclavian artery. After passing over the ganglion, the artery enters the vertebral foramen and lies posterior to the anterior tubercle of C6 (Chassaignac's Tubercle).Raj, Practical Management of Pain, 3rd ed, pp656-657 References Category:Sympathetic ganglia ","title":"Stellate ganglion"},{"id":"1881169","text":"Coin of Herod Archelaus Herod Archelaus (, Hƒìr«≠dƒìs Archelaos; 23 BC - c. 18 AD) was ethnarchJosephus, Antiquities (book 17, chapter 11, verse 4). of Samaria, Judea, and Idumea (biblical Edom), including the cities Caesarea and Jaffa, for a period of nine yearsJosephus, Wars of the Jews (book 2, chapter 7, verse 3). (c. 4 BC to 6 AD). Archelaus was removed by Roman Emperor Augustus when Judaea province was formed under direct Roman rule, at the time of the Census of Quirinius. He was the son of Herod the Great and Malthace the Samaritan, and was the brother of Herod Antipas, and the half-brother of Herod II. Archelaus (a name meaning \\"leading the people\\") came to power after the death of his father Herod the Great in 4 BC, and ruled over one-half of the territorial dominion of his father.  Biography  A map depicting the domain of Herod Archelaus as was given to him by Augustus after the death of King Herod the Great. Josephus writes that Herod the Great (father of Archelaus) was in Jericho at the time of his death.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (Wars of the Jews), 1.32.6‚Äì8 Just prior to his final trip to Jericho, he was deeply involved in a religious conflagration. Herod had placed a golden eagle over the Temple entrance which was perceived as blasphemous.Antiquities, 17, 6, 2 The eagle was chopped down with axes. Two teachers and approximately 40 other youths were arrested for this act and immolated. Herod defended his works and offered an attack on his predecessors, the dynastic Hasmoneans. Herod killed all male lineal successors of the Hasmoneans. The Pharisees had long attacked the Hasmoneans as well, as having parentage from Greeks while under bondage. This racial slur was repeated by the Pharisees through the rule of Alexander Jannaeus and Queen Salome.Antiquities, 13, 10, 5: \\"A Pharisee named 'Eleazar' accosted John Hyrcanus I with the following: 'We have heard it from old men, that thy mother had been a captive under the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes.' This story was false, and Hyrcanus was provoked against him; and all the Pharisees had a very great indignation against him.\\" With this explicit background given, Josephus began an exposition of the days of Archelaus' reign before Passover of 4 BC. Archelaus dressed in white and ascended a golden throne and appeared to be kind to the populace in Jerusalem in order to appease their desires for lower taxes and an end to the (political) imprisonment of Herod's enemies. The demeanor of the questioning appeared to turn at some point, and the crowd began to call for the punishment of those of Herod's people who ordered the death of the two teachers and the 40 youths. They also demanded the replacement of the High Priest, from the appointed High Priest of Herod's to a High Priest, \\"of greater piety and purity\\".The Jewish Wars, 2, 1, 2 Josephus does not tell who would be \\"of greater piety and purity\\". To this request, however, Archelaus acceded, although he was becoming angry at the presumptions of the crowds. Archelaus asked for moderation and told the crowds that all would be well if they would put aside their animosities and wait until he was confirmed as King by Caesar Augustus. Archelaus then left to feast with his friends. It was evening and as the darkness settled, a mourning and wailing begin over the city. Archelaus began to worry as people begin streaming into the Temple area and those who wailed for loss of the teachers continued their very loud mourning. The people were escalating in their threatening behavior. Henry St. John Thackeray's translation of Josephus here states it thus: \\"The promoters of the mourning for the doctors stood in the body of the temple, procuring recruits for their faction\\".Josephus, The Jewish War, Books I‚ÄìII, Translated by H. S. J. Thackeray, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press, Josephus does not tell us who these \\"promoters of the mourning\\", who recruit from within a body inside the Temple, could be. Archelaus then sent a general, some other people and finally a \\"tribune in Command of a Cohort\\" to reason with these \\"Seditionists\\", to stop their \\"innovations\\" and wait until Archelaus could return from Rome and Caesar. Those who came from Archelaus were stoned, with many killed. After the stoning, those who stoned the soldiers returned to their sacrifices, as if nothing had happened. Josephus does not tell who performed the sacrifices in the Temple. It was after midnight, and Archelaus suddenly ordered the entire army into the city to the Temple. Josephus records the death toll at 3000. Archelaus sent heralds around the city announcing the cancellation of Passover. Archelaus quickly sailed to Caesar and faced a group of enemies ‚Äì his own family. Antipas, the younger brother of Archelaus who was deposed from Herod's will days earlier, argued that Archelaus merely feigned grief for his father, crying during the day and involved with great \\"merriment\\" during the nights. The threats carried out by Archelaus ending in the death of 3000 in the Temple were not just threats to the worshipers in Jerusalem at Passover, but also amounted to a threat to Caesar himself, since Archelaus acted in every manner a King, before such title had been given by Caesar. At this point, Nicolaus of Damascus argued to Caesar that Archelaus acted appropriately and that Herod's will, supposedly written a few weeks prior (yielding the kingship to Archelaus and against Antipater), should be seen as valid. The change of this will in favor of Archelaus is given as Herod's true choice and, it is argued, occurred with Herod being in his right mind since he left the final decision to Caesar. The change of the will appears as one of Herod's last acts and it is attested from Jericho by one \\"Ptolemy\\", keeper of Herod's Seal. Nicholaus of Damascus had been Herod's confidant for years. He was loyal to Rome. Ptolemy was Nicholaus of Damascus' brother. Archelaus, at the conclusion of the arguments, fell at Caesar's feet. Caesar raised him up and stated that Archelaus \\"was worthy to succeed his father\\".Wars, 2, 2, 7 Caesar gave Archelaus the title of Ethnarch and divided the kingdom. Rome would consolidate its power later. Thus, Archelaus received the Tetrarchy of Judea through the last will of his father, though a previous will had bequeathed it to his brother Antipas. He was proclaimed king by the army, but declined to assume the title until he had submitted his claims to Caesar Augustus in Rome. In Rome he was opposed by Antipas and by many of the Jews, who feared his cruelty, based on the murder of 3000; but in 4 BC Augustus allotted to him the greater part of the kingdom (Samaria, Judea, and Idumea) with the title of ethnarch (a ruler of an ethnic group).Josephus, Antiquities 17.11.4. The first wife of Archelaus is given by Josephus simply as Mariamne,Wars, 2, 7. perhaps Mariamne III, daughter of Aristobulus IV, whom he divorced to marry Glaphyra. She was the widow of Archelaus' brother Alexander, though her second husband, Juba, king of Mauretania, was alive. This violation of the Mosaic law, along with Archelaus' continued cruelty, roused the ire of the Jews, who complained to Augustus. Archelaus fell into disrepute and was deposed in his 10th year of reign as ethnarch, being banished to Vienna (today Vienne) in Gaul. Samaria, Judea proper, and Idumea became the Roman province of Iudaea.H. H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 246: \\"When Archelaus was deposed from the ethnarchy in 6 AD, Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea were converted into a Roman province under the name Iudaea.\\" Biblical references Herod Archelaus from Guillaume Rouill√©'s Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum (16th century depiction) Archelaus is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 2 verse 13‚Äì23). An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to get up and take Mary and Jesus and flee to Egypt to avoid the Massacre of the Innocents. When Herod the Great died, Joseph was told by an angel in a dream to return to the land of Israel (presumably to Bethlehem). However, upon hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father as ruler of Judaea he \\"was afraid to go there\\" (Matthew 2:22), and was again warned in a dream by God \\"and turned aside to the region of\\" Galilee. This is Matthew's explanation of why Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea but grew up in Nazareth. The beginning and conclusion of Jesus' parable of the minas in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 19, may refer to Archelaus' journey to Rome. Some interpreters conclude from this that Jesus' parables and preaching made use of events familiar to the people as examples for bringing his spiritual lessons to life. Others read the allusion as arising from later adaptations of Jesus' parables in the oral tradition, before the parables were recorded in the gospels. > A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then > return ... But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, > saying, \\"We do not want this man to reign over us.\\" ... \\"But as for these > enemies of mine,\\" [said the nobleman,] \\"who did not want me to reign over > them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.\\" (, , )  See also  * Herodian dynasty * Herodian kingdom * List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources ReferencesExternal links *Herod Archelaus at Livius.org *Archelaus at The Jewish Encyclopedia Category:23 BC births Category:18 deaths Category:1st-century BC Herodian rulers Category:1st-century Herodian rulers Category:Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire Category:Herodian dynasty Category:People in the canonical gospels Category:1st-century BC rulers in Asia Category:Roman client rulers Category:1st-century monarchs in the Middle East Category:Herod the Great Category:Judea (Roman province) Category:1st-century BCE Jews Category:1st- century Jews ","title":"Herod Archelaus"},{"id":"1881174","title":"Galileo (horse)"},{"id":"1881178","text":"Lammtarra (2 February 1992 7 July 2014) was an undefeated Thoroughbred racehorse who won three Group One races in 1995 and was voted the Cartier Three-Year-Old European Champion Colt. He won The Derby in record time, the King and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He is one of only two horses to win all three races, the other being Mill Reef. Breeding The colt was owned by Saeed bin Maktoum al Maktoum, whose father, Sheikh Maktoum, bred Lammtarra at his Gainsborough Farm in Versailles, Kentucky. He was sired by Nijinsky by Northern Dancer out of The Oaks winner, Snow Bride by Blushing Groom (FR). He was inbred to Northern Dancer in the second and fourth generations (2m x 4f). Racing record Lammtarra won his only race as a two-year-old, in the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury. As a three-year-old, Lammtarra was trained for the Derby as his main target.  Epsom Derby  Racing colours of Saeed Maktoum Al Maktoum Lammtarra's Epsom Derby triumph in June 1995 came just months after the tragic fatal shooting of his young trainer Alex Scott. Scott was killed at his Newmarket stud in September 1994, at the age of 34. Before his death, Scott had been dreaming of Epsom glory with a two-year-old colt in his care. Indeed, he was so confident of Classic success that he backed the horse before it started, placing ¬£1,000 at 33/1 with Ladbrokes. But after the death of his trainer, the colt was sent to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation to continue his career. However, Lammtarra very nearly didn't get to the Derby at all. During the early part of the season, he was a sick horse and his participation was in grave doubt. When he arrived at Epsom on the big day, it was for his seasonal reappearance and his first run in 302 days. Lammtarra was at 14/1 odds to emulate his sire 25 years earlier, with Walter Swinburn as his jockey. The market was dominated by Andre Fabre's impressive 2,000 Guineas winner Pennekamp (11/8). Second favourite was Peter Chapple-Hyam's Spectrum (11/4), an easy winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas. As the field rounded Tattenham Corner, Lammtarra was stuck on the rails towards the rear of the field. With two furlongs left, Walter Swinburn got clear and Lammtarra gathered speed. Frankie Dettori's swoop on 9-1 shot Tamure had seemed certain to carry him to victory, but Lammtarra quickly made up at least six lengths in the last one and a half furlongs. He overtook Tamure deep inside the final furlong and won going away by a length. There were emotional scenes in the winner's enclosure afterwards, as Swinburn and Sheikh Mohammed paid tribute to Alex Scott. Normally, bookmakers will cancel a bet if the person placing it dies. However, Ladbrokes let Scott's ante-post bet on Lammtarra stand and paid the winnings to his widow. The official time for the race was two minutes 32.21 seconds, 1.53 seconds inside the previous Derby best. This time stood for 15 years until 2010, when it was beaten by Workforce with a time of two minutes 31.33s.  King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes  Lammtarra's next appearance was in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. He had a new jockey for this race, Frankie Dettori having replaced Swinburn. A couple of furlongs into the race, Dettori started to improve Lammtarra's position, but trainer Geoff Wragg's Pentire moved up on his outside, seemingly with plenty in hand. Pentire went to the front but only briefly as Lammtarra rallied to get his head back in front and take victory. After the race, Dettori said his mount had the heart of a lion. The horse ran just once more on a racecourse - in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp.  Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe  Lammtarra next won the Group One, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in France. Dettori settled him just off the pace, then rode him to the lead just over two furlongs out. Challengers queued up to take a shot at the English horse, but all failed. Dettori drove Lammtarra home and at the line the 21/10 favourite had three-quarters of a length to spare over Freedom Cry, with Swain two lengths further back in third. Jockey, Dettori said Lammtarra was \\"possibly\\" the best horse he's ever ridden. \\"Maybe Lammtarra is the best, because he remained unbeaten...\\". Lammtarra was sent to stud undefeated with a high value. He was tested in only four races and was one of the most lightly raced Derby winners in history.  Retirement  Lammtarra stood his first season at Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Dalham Hall Stud near Newmarket. At the end of the 1996 breeding season, he was sold to Japanese breeders for $30 million to stand at the largest stallion farm in the Hidaka area for a stud fee of ¬£30,000. His offspring met with limited success and his fee was reduced later to ¬£2,500 with a live foal guarantee. The best of his ofspring were probably the Japanese Grade 3 winners Maruka Senryo and Meisho Ramses. Although the foals have not been great performers, mares sired by him are highly sought after, due to Lammtarra's excellent bloodlines. In August 2006, it was announced that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum had bought back Lammtarra from Japan's Arrow Stud and would return to Dalham Hall Stud to live out his days in retirement. On 7 July 2014 it was announced that Lammtarra had died at Dalham Hall the previous day at the age of twenty-two.

History Towner and Moore had been friends and occasional collaborators since meeting in 1960 as students at the University of Oregon. By 1969, both were working musicians living in New York; while collaborating with folksinger Tim Hardin they were introduced to world music pioneer Paul Winter's \\"Consort\\" ensemble, particularly member Collin Walcott, with whom Towner began improvising as an informal duo. By 1970 Towner and Moore had joined the Winter Consort and met fellow member McCandless; the four began exploring improvisation on their own, while their contributions continued to be seminal in redefining the Winter Consort \\"sound\\" in compositions like Towner's \\"Icarus\\". The four musicians made their first group recording in 1970, but the label, Increase Records, went out of business before it could be released (it eventually was issued by Vanguard in 1980 as Our First Record). Oregon made its \\"formal\\" debut in NYC in 1971 (originally named \\"Thyme ‚Äî Music of Another Present Era\\", the name change to Oregon was suggested by McCandless). The group's first release Music of Another Present Era was issued on Vanguard in 1972 (the four also recorded for ECM, though the recording, 1973's Trios Solos, was billed as \\"Ralph Towner with Glen Moore\\"). With those initial recordings and the follow-ups Distant Hills (1973) and Winter Light (1974) (all on Vanguard), Oregon established itself as one of the leading improvisational groups of its day, blending Indian and Western classical music \\"We've always had a real approach to music that's very influenced by classical articulation and dynamics...We've always thought of ourselves as a small orchestra.\\" -- Ralph Towner on National Public Radio, Weekend Edition, 03/18/01 with jazz, folk, space music \\"As in previous Spacejazz excursions, we favor the more melodic or space creating players over the instrumental technicians. We'll be hearing from the group OREGON with music from 45th PARALLEL;\\" -- Music from the Hearts of Space, Program 260 : \\"Spacejazz 6 Animato\\" and avant-garde elements. The group released numerous albums on Vanguard throughout the 1970s, also making three records for Elektra/Asylum between 1978 and 1980 (including the highly acclaimed Out of the Woods and a live recording taken from performances at Carnegie Hall and in Canada in late 1979). After a couple years' hiatus devoted to individual projects (including the birth of Walcott's daughter in 1980), the group reassembled, recording for ECM, releasing the eponymous Oregon in 1983 and Crossing in 1984. Before the latter's release, however, during a 1984 tour Walcott was killed in an automobile accident in the former East Germany. Oregon temporarily disbanded, but regrouped in May 1985 at a memorial concert for Walcott in NYC, with Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu sitting in (Walcott's own choice for his replacement should it become necessary). In 1986 Gurtu was invited to join Oregon; the band resumed touring and released three albums during his five years as a member. After Trilok Gurtu's departure, the group continued as a trio, issuing two albums during that period. The 1997 album Northwest Passage marked a return to the inclusion of percussion, featuring either drummer Mark Walker or Turkish Armenian percussionist Arto Tun√ßboyacƒ±yan on most tracks; subsequently, Walker was taken on as a full member. In 1999 the ensemble traveled to Moscow, Russia to record with the Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra of Moscow Radio, premiering orchestral compositions that had been in development for years, some dating back to their first days with the Winter Consort; that project's 2000 release Oregon in Moscow garnered four Grammy nominations. 2002 saw the release of Live at Yoshi's, recorded in San Francisco, the first live Oregon recording in two decades. In March 2015, it was announced that Glen Moore was departing from the group, with bassist Paolino Dalla Porta replacing him. As of 2019, Oregon has no further plans to exist as a touring ensemble.

It is a special case of the polynomial remainder theorem.. The factor theorem states that a polynomial f(x) has a factor (x - k) if and only if f(k)=0 (i.e. k is a root).. Factorization of polynomials Two problems where the factor theorem is commonly applied are those of factoring a polynomial and finding the roots of a polynomial equation; it is a direct consequence of the theorem that these problems are essentially equivalent. The factor theorem is also used to remove known zeros from a polynomial while leaving all unknown zeros intact, thus producing a lower degree polynomial whose zeros may be easier to find. Abstractly, the method is as follows:. # \\"Guess\\" a zero a of the polynomial f. (In general, this can be very hard, but maths textbook problems that involve solving a polynomial equation are often designed so that some roots are easy to discover.) # Use the factor theorem to conclude that (x-a) is a factor of f(x). # Compute the polynomial g(x) = f(x) \\\\big/ (x-a) , for example using polynomial long division or synthetic division. # Conclude that any root x eq a of f(x)=0 is a root of g(x)=0. Since the polynomial degree of g is one less than that of f, it is \\"simpler\\" to find the remaining zeros by studying g. Example Find the factors of : x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2. To do this one would use trial and error (or the rational root theorem) to find the first x value that causes the expression to equal zero. To find out if (x - 1) is a factor, substitute x = 1 into the polynomial above: : x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2 = (1)^3 + 7(1)^2 + 8(1) + 2 : = 1 + 7 + 8 + 2 : = 18. As this is equal to 18 and not 0. This means (x - 1) is not a factor of x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2. So, we next try (x + 1) (substituting x = -1 into the polynomial): : (-1)^3 + 7(-1)^2 + 8(-1) + 2. This is equal to 0. Therefore x-(-1), which is to say x+1, is a factor, and -1 is a root of x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2. The next two roots can be found by algebraically dividing x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2 by (x+1) to get a quadratic: : {x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2 \\\\over x + 1} = x^2 + 6x + 2, and therefore (x+1) and x^2 + 6x + 2 are factors of x^3 + 7x^2 + 8x + 2. Of these the quadratic factor can be further factored using the quadratic formula, which gives as roots of the quadratic -3\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{7}. Thus the three irreducible factors of the original polynomial are x+1, x-(-3+\\\\sqrt{7}), and x-(-3-\\\\sqrt{7}).

Born in Jes√∫s Mar√≠a, Lima, Flores graduated from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in 1983, obtaining a law degree. After working as a legal advisor in the Ministry of Justice, Flores began her professional activity independently. She was a professor of law and taught at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru Law School and the University of Lima Law School between 1984 and 1989. Starting her political career at a young age as a member of the Christian People's Party (Partido Popular Cristiano), Flores would occupy the internal positions of national secretary of Electoral Affairs (1984‚Äì88), national secretary of Professionals (1987‚Äì89), national secretary of Politics (1989‚Äì92) and of General Collegiate secretary (1992‚Äì99), before being elected as chairwoman of the Christian People's Party in 2003 and re-elected in 2007. She was the first woman to become chairwoman of a political party in Peru. After a failed first candidacy to the Congress of the Republic at the age of 25, Flores was elected as a councilwoman of Lima in 1986 and re-elected in 1989, after aspiring to the office of Lieutenant Mayor of Lima. She became Deputy of the Republic in 1990, representing Lima. With the Alberto Fujimori's self-coup and the dissolution of the 1992 Parliament, Flores was elected member of the Democratic Constituent Congress in 1993 and re-elected as a Congresswoman in 1995, becoming a leader of the parliamentary opposition to the Fujimori administration. After the fall of the regime, Flores decided to run for President in 2001, finishing in third place with 24% of the national vote in the first round, behind Alejandro Toledo and Alan Garc√≠a. Flores undertook a second run for the presidency in 2006, again occupying the third place in the voting results after being overtaken by Alan Garc√≠a, who went to a run-off with Ollanta Humala. Flores is the first woman to be a major contender for the presidency in the history of Peru. Following her second presidential run, she assumed the position of chancellor of the San Ignacio de Loyola University from 2006 to 2009. She was a candidate for mayor of Lima in the municipal elections of Lima in 2010. She obtained the second place, being surpassed by her leftist rival, Susana Villar√°n, by a narrow margin. In 2016, she ran for Vice President in the Popular Alliance ticket, a heavily-criticized coalition between the Peruvian Aprista Party and the Christian People's Party for the presidential election of that year, receiving 5.83% of the voting and occupying the fifth place. Flores currently serves as the vice president of the Centrist Democrat International, a Christian democratic political international, and as a member of Washington D.C. based think tank, the Inter- American Dialogue. Biography Lourdes Flores was born in Lima on 7 October 1959. She studied at the Colegio ReIna de Los √Ångeles and at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Per√∫ Law School. She pursued graduate studies in Madrid, earning a master in legal advice at Instituto de Empresa (currently known as IE Business School) and a doctorate in law at the Universidad Complutense.\\"Comparaci√≥n de candidatos: LOURDES CELMIRA ROSARIO FLORES NANO, SUSANA MARIA DEL CARMEN VILLARAN DE LA PUENTE\\", Jurado Nacional de Elecciones 2010, As an independent lawyer, Flores specialized in civil and business law. In 1992, Flores attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She later taught commercial law at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Per√∫ and the University of Lima. She served for two years as chancellor of the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola.\\"Nueva c√°tedra\\", Ofidio, La Rep√∫blica, December 21, 2008 Early political life At age 18, Flores joined the Christian People's Party (PPC), a center-right branch of the Christian Democracy movement founded in 1966. She was an assistant to Enrique El√≠as Larosa, who became Minister of Justice. Flores was elected Deputy from Lima to the Congress of the Republic in 1990 with more than 250 000 votes. During that election, the PPC formed part of the FREDEMO front backing Mario Vargas Llosa for president. She opposed the 1992 \\"self-coup\\" of President Alberto Fujimori, organizing congressional meetings in her home. She was elected to the Democratic Constitutional Congress later that year and re-elected to Congress in 1995. She denounced Fujimori's holding of Japanese citizenship in 1997 and opposed the activities of his security chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. 2001 presidential campaign In the year 2000, Flores founded the National Unity coalition, with a center-right tendency, in order to create a single front to run for the Peruvian presidency in the 2001 general election. Facing sexism and misogyny, she led the opinion polls for several weeks, but got the third place with 24.3% of the votes, being overtaken by Alejandro Toledo and Alan Garc√≠a, who would face each other in a second round in which Toledo would win. The unfortunate comment of his father, C√©sar Flores, referring to Alejandro Toledo a few weeks after the first round, would be detrimental to the candidacy of Lourdes Flores, according to analysts, as being considered pejorative and discriminatory. Despite the loss, National Unity consolidated itself as the third opposition force of the Toledo administration, winning 17 seats out of a total of 120. During the Toledo administration, both she and her coalition remained in the opposition, although supporting some the government's economic measures. National Unity was the first political group to withdraw from the National Accord in 2002, being widely criticized. Her party even supported a possible measure of vacancy of the President and √Åntero Flores Ar√°oz obtained the presidency of Congress in 2004 thanks to the votes of the Peruvian Aprista Party. In that year, Lourdes Flores rejected the April 14 strike called by the General Confederation of Workers of Peru, which had the support of APRA leader Alan Garc√≠a.  2006 presidential campaign  Lourdes Flores ran again as the National Unity nominee for President in the 2006 race, which took place on April 9, 2006. At the end of 2005, Congressman Jos√© Barba withdrew his Cambio Radical party, having discovered a fraud of false signatures by a provincial committee. Immediately, Barba made it official that his party would be removed from the National Elections Board and would withdraw from the National Unity alliance. In 2005, when she made his candidacy official, she already obtained the first place in the polls. In August 2005, Ollanta Humala began an unexpected rise in the polls. The polls throughout the campaign projected her as the most possible successor to Alejandro Toledo. As of February 2006, Flores Nano began an advertising campaign with the slogan \\"Peru in firm hands\\". The voice-over of their advertisements was that of G√ºido Lombardi, a well-known journalist and TV political host. Her coalition, National Unity, was the only one who did not advertise with his candidates for Congress, since they only presented the presidential candidate. She was disqualified by her opponents, referring to Flores as the \\"candidate of the rich and the wealthy\\", a phrase coined by Alan Garc√≠a and his supporters against her, while members of the National Unity denounced a dirty war orchestrated by the Aprista Party and by Uni√≥n por el Per√∫ to damage directly to Lourdes Flores. The surveys of April 2006 showed an increase in Ollanta Humala, a decrease in Flores Nano and a slight increase in Alan Garc√≠a, which could be said to be a \\"technical draw\\". At 100% of the computed votes, it was announced that Ollanta Humala and Alan Garc√≠a would contest the presidency in a run-off, obtaining 30.6% and 24.3% respectively. Lourdes Flores took the third place with 23.8% of the votes, around 65,000 fewer votes than Garc√≠a. As in 2001, former President Garcia edged her out by a slim margin (0.5%) for the second run-off spot. Garcia was then elected as President. Recognizing the results that left her out of the race, Lourdes Flores affirmed that she believed she had lost \\"at the table\\", suggesting possible fraud in counting the votes at the polling tables. 2010 municipal campaign In 2010, Flores narrowly lost the election for Mayor of Lima to Susana Villar√°n of the Social Force Decentralisation Party (Partido Descentralista Fuerza Social).\\"Lourdes Flores acept√≥ su derrota electoral a la Alcald√≠a de Lima y reconoci√≥ triunfo de Susana Villar√°n\\", El Comercio, October 26, 2010 ReferencesExternal links Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lima Category:Peruvian democracy activists Category:Peruvian lawyers Category:National Unity (Peru) politicians Category:Christian People's Party (Peru) politicians Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of Peru Category:Candidates for President of Peru Category:Peruvian women in politics Category:Members of the Democratic Constituent Congress Category:Members of the Congress of the Republic of Peru Category:University of Lima faculty ","title":"Lourdes Flores"},{"id":"1881201","text":"A capping stunt or capping is a New Zealand university tradition of student pranks wherein students perpetrate hoaxes or practical jokes upon an unsuspecting population.

The stunts commonly play on the accepted civil rules of the host city with the local city councils or media as the target. The capping stunts that generate the most media exposure generally involve passive techniques such as letter writing; however, material pranks such as the suspension of inflatable genitals from university property are common.

Hyman & Co, Denver, as an insecticide. Dieldrin is closely related to aldrin, which reacts further to form dieldrin. Aldrin is not toxic to insects; it is oxidized in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound. Both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the Diels-Alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene. Originally developed in the 1940s as an alternative to DDT, dieldrin proved to be a highly effective insecticide and was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s. Endrin is a stereoisomer of dieldrin. However, it is an extremely persistent organic pollutant; it does not easily break down. Furthermore, it tends to biomagnify as it is passed along the food chain. Long-term exposure has proven toxic to a very wide range of animals including humans, far greater than to the original insect targets. For this reason, it is now banned in most of the world. It has been linked to health problems such as Parkinson's, breast cancer, and immune, reproductive, and nervous system damage. It is also an endocrine disruptor, acting as an estrogen and antiandrogen, and can adversely affect testicular descent in the fetus if a pregnant woman is exposed to it. Synthesis Dieldrin can be formed from the Diels-Alder reaction of hexachloro-1,3-cyclopentadiene with norbornadiene followed by epoxidation of the addition product with a peroxy acid such as paracetic acid as shown below. Synthesis of dieldrin Legislation and history The chemicals dieldrin and aldrin were widely applied in agricultural areas throughout the world. Both are toxic and bioaccumulative. Aldrin does break down to dieldrin in living systems, but dieldrin is known to resist bacterial and chemical breakdown processes in the environment. Aldrin was used to control soil pests (namely termites) on corn and potato crops. Dieldrin was an insecticide used on fruit, soil, and seed. It persists in the soil with a half-life of five years at temperate latitudes. Both aldrin and dieldrin may be volatilized from sediment and redistributed by air currents, contaminating areas far from their sources. They have been measured in Arctic wildlife, suggesting long range transport from southern agricultural regions.(Orris et al. 2000) Both aldrin and dieldrin have been banned in most developed countries, but aldrin is still used as a termiticide in Malaysia, Thailand, Venezuela and parts of Africa. In Canada, their sale was restricted in the mid-1970s, with the last registered use of the compounds in Canada being withdrawn in 1984.Toxin Description IPCS quotes the World Health Organization as stating dieldrin is prohibited for use in agriculture in, among others, Brazil, Ecuador, Finland, the German Democratic Republic, Singapore, Sweden, Yugoslavia, and the USSR. The European Community legislation prohibits the marketing of phytopharmaceutical products containing dieldrin. In Argentina, Canada, Chile, the Federal Republic of Germany, Hungary, and the USA, its use is prohibited, with some exceptions. The use of dieldrin is restricted in India, Mauritius, Togo, and the United Kingdom. Its use in industry is prohibited in Switzerland and its manufacture and use in Japan is under government control. In Finland, the only accepted use for dieldrin is as a termiticide in one glue mixture for exported plywood. India requires registration and licences for all importation, manufacture, sale, or storage. Australia Organochlorines and other chemicals were originally developed in the 1930s for use as insecticides and pesticides. DDT became famous worldwide in 1939 after its use in overcoming a typhus infestation in Naples. The use of organochlorines increased during the 1950s and peaked in the 1970s. Their use in Australia was dramatically lowered between the mid 1970s and the early 1980s. The first restrictions on the use of dieldrin and related chemicals in Australia were introduced in 1961-2, with registration required for their use on produce animals, such as cattle and chickens. This coincided with increasing concerns worldwide about the long-term effects of persistent pesticides. The publication of Silent Spring (an account of the environmental and health effects of pesticides) by Rachel Carson in 1962 was a key driving force in raising this concern. The phase-out process was driven by government bans and deregistration, in turn promoted by changing public perceptions that food containing residues of these chemicals was less acceptable and possibly hazardous to health. Throughout this time, continuous pressure was maintained by relevant committees, for example the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (TCAC), to reduce approved organochlorine use. By 1981, the use of dieldrin worldwide was limited to sugarcane and bananas, and these uses were deregistered by 1985. In 1987, a nationwide recall system was put into place, and in December of that year, the government prohibited all imports of these chemicals into Australia without express ministerial approval. In 1994, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals published a use of organochlorines in termite control, recommending the phase- out of organochlorines used in termite control upon development of viable alternatives. The same year, the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand decided to phase out remaining organochlorine uses by 30 June 1995, with the exception of the Northern Territory. In November 1997, the use of all organochlorines other than mirex was phased out in Australia. Remaining stocks of mirex are to be used only for contained baits for termites in plantations of young trees in the Northern Territory until stocks run out, which is expected in the near future. The recognition of negative impacts on health has stimulated the implementation of multiple legislative policies in regards to the use and disposal of organochlorine pesticides. For example, the Environment Protection (Marine) Policy 1994 became operational in May 1995 in South Australia. It dictated the acceptable concentration of toxicants such as dieldrin in marine waters and the manner in which these levels must be tested and tried. Momentum against organochlorine and similar molecules continued to grow internationally, leading, to negotiations which matured as the Stockholm Convention on the use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). POPs are defined as hazardous and environmentally persistent substances which can be transported between countries by the earth's oceans and atmosphere. Most POPs (including dieldrin) bioaccumulate in the fatty tissues of humans and other animals. The Stockholm Convention banned 12 POPs, nicknamed \\"the dirty dozen\\". These include: aldicarb, toxaphene, chlordane and heptachlor, chlordimeform, chlorobenzilate, DBCP, DDT, \\"drins\\" (aldrin, dieldrin and endrin), EDB, HCH and lindane, paraquat, parathion and methyl parathion, pentachlorophenol, and 2,4,5-T. This took force on 17 May 2004. Australia ratified the Convention only three days later and became a party to it in August that year. Well before this, Australia had been well advanced in meeting the measures agreed upon under the Convention. Production, import and use of aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), heptachlor, endrin, and toxaphene are not permitted in Australia. Production and importation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are not permitted in Australia, with the phase-out of existing PCBs being managed under the National Strategy for the Management of Scheduled Waste. This strategy also addresses how Australia will manage HCB waste and organochlorine pesticides. Legislation in Australia on the import, use and disposal of dieldrin and other organochlorines has been extensive and covers mainly environmental and potential health impacts on the population.

Life  Alix was the second daughter born to King Louis VII of France and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, and was named after her aunt Petronilla of Aquitaine, who was also called \\"Alix\\". The birth of a second daughter to Eleanor and Louis instead of a badly needed son was one of the final nails in the coffin of their marriage. Her parents' marriage was annulled in 1152, barely a year after Alix's birth. She and her sister, Marie, were declared legitimate, and the custody of the two girls was awarded to their father.

The Sarƒ±yer district is a huge area consisting of the villages on the European side of the Bosphorus from Rumelifeneri, down through Tarabya, Yenik√∂y, ƒ∞stinye, Emirgan to Rumelihisarƒ±. Sarƒ±yer also administers the Black Sea coast to the west of the mouth of the Bosphorus including the village of Kilyos. Its neighbours are Ey√ºp to the northwest, Be≈üikta≈ü to the south and Kaƒüƒ±thane to the west. Sarƒ±yer has a population of approximately 260,000. The mayor is ≈û√ºkr√º Gen√ß (CHP). Some parts of Beyoƒülu and √áatalca were joined and Sarƒ±yer became district centre in 1930. The district boundaries shrunk after the county of Kemerburgaz was given to the Ey√ºp district in 1936 and villages of Maslak and Ayazaƒüa were given to ≈ûi≈üli district in 1954. Sarƒ±yer has present boundaries after joining boroughs of Maslak, Ayazaƒüa and Huzur from ≈ûi≈üli district in 2012. The North Bosphorus Yenik√∂y Fishermen in Sarƒ±yer's harbour Sarƒ±yer's Bosphorus villages, backed by steep hills, were once rural fishing communities. They later became retreats for the city's wealthy. In the Ottoman period the sultans came to these villages for picnics and excursions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the coast was lined with summer residences of the wealthy foreign traders of Pera and Galata. Many foreign embassies built summer residences in this period. Since the construction of the coast road, these villages, and increasingly the hillsides behind them, house many expensive villas owned by ƒ∞stanbul's rich businessmen, actors and musicians, attracted by the coastline and the lush forest behind. Sarƒ±yer has recently been supplied with natural gas. Significant parts of the district have also seen the installation of a new drainage system, particularly in the village of Sarƒ±yer itself and along the coast road. These projects have led to chronic road construction and its attendant traffic. Sarƒ±yer itself has particularly heavy traffic. The coast road running through Sarƒ±yer is lined with fish restaurants of all kinds, many of which were formerly housed in boats moored by the sea wall. This coast is so popular with day-trippers and Sunday drivers that at weekends the pleasure of a drive along Sarƒ±yer's is mitigated by the crawling queues of traffic. In addition to the coast road, Sarƒ±yer is connected to the downtown historic and financial centers by Buyukdere Road, the main road from Be≈üikta≈ü up to Maslak and beyond; this is the route used by minibuses serving Sarƒ±yer-Be≈üikta≈ü. There is also high-speed ferry boat service for commuting to the city. However, as a drive through Sarƒ±yer during commute times and rush hour will attest, many people commute by car. The Bosphorus communities of Sarƒ±yer include (south to north): *Emirgan is former retreat from the city, backed by a hillside still green despite the recent construction of villas within it. The district is named for the Ottoman lords (Emirs) that came here on excursions. There is a square in the center, shaded by a huge plane tree, with a cafe in the middle. Home to the Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ± Museum. *Re≈üitpa≈üa is a crowded district on the hill above Emirgan. It is a big village, with attractive villas and much illegal gecekondu housing on a forested hillside. The modern campus of the Istanbul Stock Exchange is nearby, as are one campus of the Istanbul Technical University and a large new mall, Istinye Park. *Istinye is a fishing port, which once contained a shipyard, with a village behind and tea gardens by the sea. As in so many other areas, luxury condos now rise from Istinye's hillsides. In 2003 the imposing American consulate was built here. The town's stream was once polluted with sewage. The stream is now biologically treated to eradicate any effluent to the Bosphorus. *Yenik√∂y consists of luxury villas on a hillside and a small area of tightly packed old houses near the sea. The latter area, the old village, has a longstanding Greek community, evidenced by its Orthodox churches. Yenik√∂y's long-established cafes and bakeries lends to a cosmopolitan feeling reminiscent of old Istanbul. Former prime minister Tansu √áiller lives in a town-house on the seafront. In recent years Yenik√∂y has acquired a community of Filipinos, working as domestic help in the big villas. *Tarabya was formerly the Greek Ther√†pia, the name of which comes from the Greek word therapeia (therapy) and indicates the area's former use as a sanctuary from the city for the sick. It is now a classy neighbourhood, dominated by the once grand Tarabya Hotel. There are fish restaurants and 'taverna' featuring traditional Turkish music, drink, and atmosphere. Marmara University has a small site here, teaching French, housed in a villa built by Alexander Ypsilantis. A stream once flowed to the Bosphorus, but is now covered by concrete. Tarabya also is home to the German consulate. *B√ºy√ºkdere was formerly the Greek-Byzantine Vathys K√≤lpos District, 'the deep gulf' in Greek). It was originally a quiet residential area composed mostly of old, quiet neighborhoods. However, recent years have seen the construction of expensive apartments and condominiums. Home to a number of churches, the Spanish and Russian summer consulates and the Sadberk Hanim Museum. There are places to sit by the Bosphorus and sip tea. *Bah√ßek√∂y was formerly the Byzantine Petra district. One of the northern villages of Sarƒ±yer. After Suleiman the Magnificent came back from Belgrade, he settled the Serbs in the nearby forest, which has since been known as the \\"Belgrade\\" Forest (Belgrad Ormanƒ±.) In the 19th century, the village was inside the Belgrad Forest but due to the latter's retreat before development, Bah√ßek√∂y now sits on the forest's edge. Atat√ºrk Arboretum is in Bah√ßek√∂y. *Sarƒ±yer itself is a traditional rural and working-class Turkish town, lacking in infrastructure, it is relaxed, friendly and has a high proportion of retired residents. You will see them taking long walks along the Bosphorus. Fishing is still practiced in its small harbor. The industry feeds the local fish market and a long line of famous fish restaurants. There are also a variety of caf√©s, kebab houses and bars, where many of ƒ∞stanbul's residents come to eat and drink on weekends. Many of the restaurants are owned by famous musicians, who sometimes put on live shows for customers. The forest hinterland The Belgrad Forest, at one time the Ottoman military would come on exercises. Today it is popular for picnics at the weekend, and the road to Kilyos passes through here. The woods are home to Istanbul University's department of forestry, and are accessible by public transport. There have always been rural communities here but since the 1990s, luxury housing and private schools have been built in parts of the forest. The largest of these developments is the new village of Zekeriyak√∂y, which is now one of the most expensive residential areas in Istanbul. The campus of the prestigious, private Ko√ß University is also located in the forest. The growth of these areas may have, along with construction and poorly conceived traffic flow planning, contributed to the heavy traffic in the village of Sarƒ±yer. Kilyos and the Black Sea Kilyos is a small town, a pleasant retreat from the city, although it is often windswept in winter. Indeed, the Black Sea can produce dramatic storms even in the summer. Some Istanbul residents swim in the sea at Kilyos, although the rocky coast and strong currents, including, in places, a dangerous undertow, may make swimming here risky. The road to Kilyos leads through the Belgrad Forest with its system of viaducts and reservoirs going back to the Ottoman period, although it is also accessible through the village of Sarƒ±yer, leading to serious traffic delays during summer months. There are lovely cool spots to stop in the forest or go for a country walk, and the hilltops have marvellous views of the Bosphorus and the Black Sea. For many years this area has been a popular spot for picnics. In recent years Kilyos has acquired a number of bars and cafes, including a couple of well-known private beach clubs and a rock festival in summer. There are still beaches though and plenty of spots for a picnic, so on Sundays long queues of cars snake through the forest honking their horns at each other.

Its members are Gary LeVox (lead vocals), Jay DeMarcus (bass guitar, background vocals), and Joe Don Rooney (lead guitar, background vocals). DeMarcus is LeVox's second cousin, a brother-in-law of country music singer James Otto, and a former member of the contemporary Christian music duo East to West. From 2000 to 2010, they recorded for Disney Music Group's Lyric Street Records. While on that label, they released six studio albums, all of which have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In order of release, they are Rascal Flatts (2000), Melt (2002), Feels Like Today (2004), Me and My Gang (2006), Still Feels Good (2007), and Unstoppable (2009). After Lyric Street closed in 2010, they moved to Big Machine Records, for which they have released four studio albums and one Christmas album: Nothing Like This (2010), Changed (2012), Rewind (2014), The Greatest Gift of All (2016), and their final studio album, Back to Us (2017). They have charted forty singles, sixteen of which have reached No. 1 on Billboard Hot Country Songs, Country Airplay or Canada Country. Their longest-lasting No. 1 single, a cover of Marcus Hummon's \\"Bless the Broken Road\\", spent five weeks in that position in 2005. Through 2006‚Äì07, \\"What Hurts the Most\\" was No. 1 on both the Hot Country Songs and Adult Contemporary charts, and peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. On January 7, 2020, the band announced that they would be disbanding following a farewell tour after 21 years together. On May 19, 2020, the farewell tour was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Rascal Flatts on Cancelled Farewell Tour and How They Want to Be Remembered  Billboard's 5-Minute Interview retrieved July 31, 2020 History Rascal Flatts' founding was at Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar in Nashville, Tennessee. Gary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus are second cousins from a musical family. DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called East to West; his brother-in-law, James Otto, is also a country music singer. In 1997, DeMarcus called LeVox, and convinced him to come to Nashville and provide some harmonies on Michael English's album Gospel, which he was producing. They engineered the album together, and became English's back-up band. At the same time, DeMarcus had become the bandleader of Chely Wright's band, where he met Joe Don Rooney, the guitarist in that band. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a Printer's Alley nightclub and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney to join them. Jim Riley was the drummer and bandleader for the band. The group covered the hit Shenandoah single \\"The Church on Cumberland Road\\" that night. To the group's recollection, a bond was formed instantly. Singer Mila Mason recommended the group to record producers Mark Bright and Marty Williams, who played Lyric Street Records A&R; Doug Howard a three-song demo and Howard thought they were \\"just incredible.\\" After he'd heard the demos, the band went into the Lyric Street offices the next day, sat down with acoustic guitars, and played a couple of songs. According to Howard in an interview with HitQuarters: \\"The vocals and harmonies, it was all there‚ÄîI was just blown away. The lead singer has such a unique and compelling voice.\\" The band was signed to Lyric Street in late 1999. Career=2000‚Äì2005: Rascal Flatts, Melt, and Feels Like Today In early 2000, the group made its debut with the single \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\". This song had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed. The song, which reached No. 3 on the Billboard country charts, was the first single from their self-titled debut, which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street. Following \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\", the album's other three singles all made the Top 10 on that chart with \\"This Everyday Love\\", \\"While You Loved Me\\", and \\"I'm Movin' On\\", which respectively peaked at numbers 9, 7, and 4. \\"I'm Movin' On\\" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002. Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed the album with favor, calling it \\"a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album\\". Their second album, entitled Melt, was released in 2002. Unlike their previous album, Rascal Flatts co-produced this one. The album's first single, \\"These Days\\", became the band's first number one hit on the U.S. country charts. The album included two more Top 10 hits with \\"Love You Out Loud\\" \\"I Melt\\", and \\"Mayberry\\". The latter became the band's second number one. The music video for \\"I Melt\\" featured partial nudity and was banned from the Great American Country (GAC) network. Rascal Flatts's third album, Feels Like Today, was released in late 2004. The album's title track was released as its first single. Following it was \\"Bless the Broken Road\\". That song was originally recorded by its co-writer, Marcus Hummon, and had also been recorded by Melodie Crittenden (whose version made the country chart in 1998), the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Sons of the Desert. In early 2005, Rascal Flatts's version became the band's third number one hit on the U.S. country charts and spent five weeks at that position. The third single, \\"Fast Cars and Freedom\\", hit number one as well. While the latter was climbing the charts, some radio stations began playing a hidden track on the album, titled \\"Skin\\". This airplay caused \\"Skin\\" to enter the top 40. The song was released as a single under the title \\"Skin (Sarabeth)\\" and officially added to the album's track list. 2005‚Äì2007: Me and My Gang and Still Feels Good Rascal Flatts's thirteenth chart entry, \\"What Hurts the Most\\", was released in December 2005. This song had previously been recorded by Mark Wills in 2003. Rascal Flatts' version of that song was released as the first single from their fourth album Me and My Gang, which was released in 2006. For this album, the band worked with producer Dann Huff. They switched producers to create a more band- oriented album. Rascal Flatts' rendition of \\"What Hurts the Most\\" was a crossover hit for the band, reaching No. 1 on both the country and adult contemporary charts, as well as peaking with the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. After it, the album's title track was released as the second single and charted in the Top 10 at number 6. The third and fourth singles, \\"My Wish\\" and \\"Stand\\", both reached number one. Also in 2006, the group charted in the top 10 of the Hot 100 with a cover of Tom Cochrane's \\"Life Is a Highway\\", which they recorded for the Pixar film Cars. Although \\"Life Is a Highway\\" was not released to country radio, several country stations did begin playing the song, causing it to chart within the top 20 of Hot Country Songs. Me and My Gang had the highest US debut of 2006, with 722,000 units in April.Christman, Ed (2006-10-07), \\"Million-Unit Question\\".

USA Today Later the same year, the group released the single \\"Take Me There\\", a song which Kenny Chesney co-wrote and had initially planned to record himself. That song became a number-one country hit in September and served as the first single from the album Still Feels Good. It was followed by \\"Winner at a Losing Game\\", which was the first single which the band wrote themselves. Both it and its followup \\"Every Day\\" peaked at No. 2 on the country charts. The fourth single from the album, \\"Bob That Head\\", became the band's first single to miss the Top 10 on the chart. The fifth and final single, \\"Here\\", was released in August 2008 and became the band's ninth Number One hit on the chart week of January 3, 2009. 2008‚Äì2010: Greatest Hits Volume 1 and Unstoppable Rascal Flatts released their first compilation album, Greatest Hits Volume 1, on October 28, 2008. The album contains 13 of their biggest songs, starting with \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\" and going through \\"Life Is a Highway\\". The limited edition of the album contains a second disc with three Christmas songs: \\"White Christmas\\", \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\", and \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\". A year later in October 2009, they released a second edition of their greatest hits collection, this time with a second disc containing live performances of \\"Take Me There\\", \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Me & My Gang\\", and \\"Winner at a Losing Game\\". In January 2009, Rascal Flatts released the song \\"Here Comes Goodbye\\" as the first single from the album Unstoppable, which was released on April 7 of that year. Co- written by American Idol season six finalist Chris Sligh, \\"Here Comes Goodbye\\" became the group's tenth number one hit. The second single form the Unstoppable album, \\"Summer Nights\\", which was co-written by Gary LeVox, was released in early May 2009. That song debuted at No. 57 and topped out at No. 2 on the country charts. The group performed \\"Summer Nights\\" at the CMT Music Awards, Oprahs Kickoff Party, and the finale of America's Got Talent. The third single off the album, \\"Why\\", peaked at No. 18 on the country charts. Rascal Flatts performed that song on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. The title track was released as the album's fourth single in January 2010. A special release version of their album Unstoppable was sold at JCPenney stores nationwide. It features a special release song entitled \\"American Living\\" only available on the albums sold at JCPenney stores. JCPenney is an official sponsor of Rascal Flatts' Unstoppable American Living Tour in a two-year partnership and $1 of every CD sold at JCPenney will be donated to the JCPenney Afterschool Fund. On July 16, 2009, as part of the JCPenney American Living Tour, Rascal Flatts made history as the first country music group to play Chicago's Wrigley Field. The trio was joined by fellow artists Vince Gill and Darius Rucker for a near-sellout crowd. 2010‚Äì2011: Nothing Like This and The Best of Rascal Flatts Live After the closure of Lyric Street in April 2010, Rascal Flatts signed to Big Machine Records in July of that year. The group's first single from the label was the song \\"Why Wait\\". The song was the first single from the album Nothing Like This, which was released November 16, 2010. In December 2010, \\"Why Wait\\" became the trio's eleventh number one hit on the U.S. country charts. In March 2011, Rascal Flatts was featured on a remix of Justin Bieber's song \\"That Should Be Me\\". The second single from Nothing Like This was \\"I Won't Let Go\\". That song went to number 2 in early 2011. Following it was the band's first collaborative release to country radio, \\"Easy\\", which is a duet with British pop singer Natasha Bedingfield. \\"I Won't Let Go\\", and \\"Easy\\" peaked at numbers 2 and 3 respectively on the country charts. On November 8, 2011, Hollywood Records released The Best of Rascal Flatts Live. 2012‚Äì2013: Changed Rascal Flatts' eighth studio album, Changed, was released on April 3, 2012.

In the services industry, strategic sourcing refers to a service solution, sometimes called a strategic partnership, which is specifically customized to meet the client's individual needs. In a production environment, it is often considered one component of supply chain management. Modern supply chain management professionals have placed emphasis on defining the distinct differences between strategic sourcing and procurement. Procurement operations support tactical day-to-day transactions such as issuing purchase orders to suppliers, whereas strategic sourcing represents to strategic planning, supplier development, contract negotiation, supply chain infrastructure, and outsourcing models. Term The term \\"strategic sourcing\\" was popularized through work with a variety of blue chip companies by a number of consulting firms in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. This methodology has become the norm for procurement departments in large, sophisticated companies such as fortune 500 companies. Strategic sourcing is the process of developing channels of supply at the lowest total cost, not just the lowest purchase price. It expands upon traditional purchasing activities to embrace all activities within the procurement cycle, from specification to receipt and payment of goods and services. Steps The steps in a strategic sourcing process were defined, in 1994, as:Nishiguchi, Toshihiro. Strategic Industrial Sourcing (New York: Oxford University, 1994) # Assessment of a company's current spending (what is bought, where, at what prices?). # Assessment of the supply market (who offers what?). # Total cost analyses (how much does it cost to provide those goods or services?). # Identification of suitable suppliers. # Development of a sourcing strategy (where to purchase, considering demand and supply situations, while minimizing risk and costs). # Negotiation with suppliers (products, service levels, prices, geographical coverage, Payment Terms, etc.). # Implementation of new supply structure. # Track results and restart assessment (Continuous cycle) A slimmed down strategic sourcing process was defined, in 2012, as:Payne, Joe and Dorn, William. Managing Indirect Spend: Enhancing Profitability Through Strategic Sourcing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2012) # Data collection and spend analysis # Market Research # The RFx process (also known as go to market)Unpacking Competitive Bidding Methods: The Essential ABCs of the Various RFX Methods>2016Vested Wayaccessed 2 October 2016 # Negotiations # Contracting # Implementation and continuous improvement While the modernized process combines the market assessment and cost analyses steps of the older model into a single \\"market research\\" step, and the supplier identification and sourcing strategy development steps into a single \\"go-to-market\\" step, negotiation has split into \\"negotiation\\" and \\"contracting.\\" This change is due to the heightened importance of market intelligence in modern strategic sourcing plans, and its ability to deliver value by improving both pricing and contract terms when leveraged against the identified suppliers. Although both descriptions of the sourcing process are accurate to some extent, there is no standard set of steps and procedures. As strategic sourcing is put in place and practiced over time, many large, sophisticated organizations will modify the process to better meet their individual corporate needs. Outsourcing a business practice to another company may also be incorporated into a sourcing strategy for services. This strategy may involve the transfer of staff and assets to the outsource company. Due to the strategic and complex nature of outsourcing, many organizations such as Procter & Gamble, Microsoft and McDonald's have created what is referred to as Vested Outsourcing agreements to help build highly collaborative win-win business relationships. Researchers at the University of Tennessee provide guidance on how to create Vested Outsourcing agreements in their book Vested Outsourcing: Five Rules that will Transform Outsourcing.  Sourcing plan  The sourcing plan is the result of all planning efforts on strategic sourcing. Into this planning, all sourcing events are organized and detailed with tactical and operational information such as the sourcing team responsible for each event, when the sourcing event is supposed to begin and end based on each RFX step (RFI, RFP, RFQ), the requirements, specifications of all services or materials, and negotiations/cost goals. The objective of the sourcing plan is to manage the timing and quality of all sourcing events in the strategic sourcing program. Many procurement professionals continue to conduct sourcing and RFX activities manually using spreadsheets; however, this creates risk for error and gaps in the sourcing process.  Sourcing optimization  Operations research is a discipline of applying advanced techniques to help make better decisions. Optimization, in turn, utilizes mathematical algorithms to rapidly solve a business problem by evaluating all possible outcomes (or many outcomes) and selecting those ones that yield the best solution. When applied to sourcing and supply chain operations, optimization helps the sourcing professional simultaneously evaluate thousands of different procurement inputs. This evaluation can take into consideration the global market, specific current supply chain conditions, and individual supplier conditions, and offers alternatives to address the buyer‚Äôs sourcing goals. Furthermore, it allows internal stakeholders in the buying organization to impose constraints on the award or specify preferences to favor certain non-cost objectives such as limited switching, reduced supplier numbers or higher quality outcomes.  Cooperative sourcing  Cooperative sourcing is a collaboration or negotiation of different companies, which have similar business processes. To save costs, the competitor with the best production function can insource the business process of the other competitors. This is especially common in IT-oriented industries due to low to no variable costs, e.g. banking. Since all of the negotiating parties can be outsourcers or insourcers the main challenge in this collaboration is to find a stable coalition and the company with the best production function. This is difficult since the real production costs are hard to estimate and negotiators might be tempted to portray their real cost much higher than they actually are in order to demand higher fees for insourcing. High switching costs, costs for searching potential cooperative sourcers, and negotiating often result in inefficient solutions.  Sourcing business models  Sourcing Business Models are a systems-based approach to structuring supplier relationships. A sourcing business model is a type of business model that is applied to business relationships where more than one party needs to work with another party to be successful. There are seven sourcing business models that range from the transactional to investment- based. The seven models are: Basic Provider, Approved Provider, Preferred Provider, Performance-Based/Managed Services Model, Vested outsourcing Business Model, Shared Services Model, and Equity Partnership Model. Sourcing business models are targeted for procurement professionals who seek a modern approach to achieve the best fit between buyers and suppliers.  In popular culture  Strategic sourcing from a professional standpoint is lampooned in the American syndicated comic strip Sally Forth, in which the titular character's husband Ted Forth is employed within this field for the duration of the series's run. Sally Forth is currently written by the writer- illustrator team of Craig MacIntosh and Francesco Marciuliano and frequently lampoons many aspects of business and procurement culture and new trends in purchasing innovation.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. Although Pamiers is the largest city in Ari√®ge, the capital is the smaller town of Foix. The seat of the Bishop of Pamiers is at the Pamiers Cathedral. The current mayor of the town is Fr√©d√©rique Thiennot, who succeeded Andr√© Trigano in 2020 after holding the post for 25 years. Geography Pamiers is located on the Ari√®ge River. The town of Pamiers is famous for its three bell towers and for being the birthplace of Gabriel Faur√©, one of the greatest French musicians and composers of the late 19th and early 20th century. It also boasts awards for Ville fleurie, the equivalent of \\"town in bloom\\". Local facilities include good restaurants, bars, supermarkets, large public indoor and outdoor swimming pools (one of which is 50m). Street in the town centre Pamiers lies in an ancient alluvial plain of the Ari√®ge River in the area called La Basse Ari√®ge, noted for its rich fertile soil ideal for agriculture. Pamiers has 17,000 inhabitants, the Appam√©ens, and is the economic capital of the Ari√®ge, being the most important town in the department. The town itself dates back to the 5th century. The origin of its name is subject to debate. A certain school of linguists tends to believe that it was derived from the fact that, when Pamiers was founded, its new inhabitants were given land parcels measured in pams', from empan (from the Latin \\"pannus\\" meaning \\"piece of cloth\\"). Originally it was called Ville de Pams. Another explanation is one involving Roger II de Foix, who had gone to a crusade in the region of Apamea in Syria and who, upon his return to France, gave his castle and domain the name of one of his battles: Castrum Appamiae, name later on given to the town. The fact that Pamiers' inhabitants are called Appam√©ens would seem to favour this hypothesis. In the 18th century a plural stance on the word was introduced making the name \\"Apamias\\" derived from ecclesiastical language and also similar to the Occitan language. The Occitan name \\"Pamias\\" can be seen on the town sign, alongside the French name Pamiers, as one enters the town via the old route from Toulouse, RN20. The main square of Pamiers, Place de la R√©publique, is paved in red marble. Every week, three large open-air farmers' markets are held, plus a flea market every Sunday morning.

FireHOL does not have graphical user interface, but is configured through an easy to understand plain text configuration file. A further advantage of FireHOL is its friendliness to beginners - you don't have to worry about the answer packet because FireHOL first parses the configuration file and then sets the appropriate iptables rules to achieve the expected firewall behavior. It is a large, complex BASH script file, depending on the iptables console tools rather than communicating with the kernel directly. This has the advantage of portability; any Linux system with iptables, BASH, and the appropriate tools can run it. Its main drawback is slower starting times, particularly on older systems. Since this delay only happens once per boot‚Äîor less, if the resulting rules are saved to disk‚Äîhigh performance for this is not generally important except in embedded systems. FireHOL also benefits from the shell's flexibility, being easily extended and configured to a high degree; FireHOL's configuration files are fully functional BASH scripts in of themselves.

Most of its inhabitants commute to Bucharest, with Pope»ôti-Leordeni being seen as a satellite town of the Romanian capital. History Pope»ôti-Leordeni was historically the site of two separate villages -- Pope»ôti (name derived from popƒÉ, \\"priest\\" - akin to the word \\"pope\\") and Leordeni (name derived from leurdƒÉ, \\"ramsons\\" or Allium ursinum). The villages were first attested during the 16th century: Leordeni was a domain of the BƒÉleanu family of Wallachian boyars, while Pope»ôti was included in the lands belonging to ancestors of the chronicler Radu Popescu. The latter was inherited by the Phanariote nobleman known under the name Alexandru Conduratu, who settled it with Bulgarians from around Nikopol and from the Banat; the newly created locality was named Pope»ôti-Conduratu or Pavlicheni, in reference to \\"Paulicians\\" (a tradition designated the Roman Catholic group of the Bulgarian community by the names of their ancestors). Pope»ôti and Leordeni were united into a single commune in 1873; boyar lands were divided by successive land reforms, and the Conduratu manor house was passed to the Costa-Foru family (whose member Constantin Costa-Foru was a well-known journalist in the interwar period). As it stands, Pope»ôti-Leordeni is currently a growing suburb of Bucharest, and has seen large developments from the 2010s onwards.

It is part of the ward of Lozells and East Handsworth and lies between the districts of Handsworth and Aston. Lozells has a high population density compared to East Handsworth. It is a very ethnically diverse area with a high population of people of Afro- Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin. Housing in Lozells consists mainly of terraced houses, which were constructed during the Industrial Revolution when the area became industrialised and the workers required housing. The housing is a mix of private and council housing, with some newer post-war tower-blocks and estates. Lozells Road was the scene of rioting from 9‚Äì11 September 1985, with shops, houses and vehicles being burnt, and looting also taking place. Racial tension, high unemployment and hostility towards the police were seen as major factors of the rioting. Further riots on the night of the 22 October 2005 left two men dead and a police officer shot and wounded. These riots were started by an unsubstantiated rumour, broadcast on a pirate radio station, of a girl being raped. Four men were later jailed for their part in the riots.

What had begun as a local conflict over the control of the Val M√ºstair and the Umbrail Pass in the Grisons soon got out of hand when both parties called upon their allies for help; the Habsburgs demanding the support of the Swabian League, and the Federation of the Three Leagues of the Grisons turning to the Swiss Eidgenossenschaft. Hostilities quickly spread from the Grisons through the Rhine valley to Lake Constance and even to the Sundgau in southern Alsace, the westernmost part of Habsburg Further Austria.The main references used are Morard in general and Riezler for the detailed chronology in the section on the course of the war. Many battles were fought from January to July 1499, and in all but a few minor skirmishes, the experienced Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance to fight a war that even the Swabian counts considered to be more in the interests of the powerful Habsburgs than in the interest of the Holy Roman EmpireMorard, N.: Die Eidgenossen auf der europ√§ischen B√ºhne, pp. 316 - 326 in Schwabe & Co.

When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, Emperor Maximilian I had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499, in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the Eidgenossenschaft officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus de facto acknowledged it as a separate political entity. Background One source of conflict was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which had risen to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, the members of the Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes who had tried to regain their former territories. Habsburgs in the Holy Roman Empire in the 15th century Emperor Frederick III When Frederick III of Habsburg ascended to the throne, the Swiss suddenly faced a new situation in which they could no longer count on support from the empire. Worse yet, conflicts with the Habsburg dukes threatened to become conflicts with the empire itself. Under Frederick's reign, this did not occur yet. Frederick had sided in 1442 against the confederacy in the Old Z√ºrich War where he had supported the city of Z√ºrich, and he also refused to reconfirm the imperial immediacy of the members of the Confederacy. But Frederick's troubled reign did not leave room for military operations against the Swiss. In Austria, Frederick was in conflict first with his brother Albert and then faced the pressure of Matthias Corvinus, who even drove him from Vienna and forced Frederick's court to assume an itinerant lifestyle. In the empire, Frederick faced the opposition of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been in conflict with the Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold. In 1487, Sigismund arranged the marriage of Frederick's daughter Kunigunde to Duke Albert IV of Bavaria against her father's will, and he also signed away some of his territories in Tyrol and Further Austria to Albert IV. Frederick intervened by force: he founded the Swabian League in 1488, an alliance of the Swabian cities, the Swabian knights of the League of St. George's Shield and the counts of W√ºrttemberg and Tyrol and Vorarlberg. With their help, he forced the Wittelsbach house to return the territories signed over by Sigismund. In 1490, Sigismund was forced to abdicate and turn over all his territories to Frederick's son Maximilian I. Maximilian had married Mary of Burgundy in 1477 after the death of Charles the Bold in the Burgundy Wars and thus inherited the Burgundian territories: Duchy and County of Burgundy and the Netherlands. He took over and expanded the Burgundian administration with a more centralized style of government, which in 1482, caused the outbreak of a rebellion of the cities and counts, allied with Charles VIII of France, against Maximilian.N.N.: Maximilian I , Haus der Bayrischen Geschichte. URL last accessed 2006-10-06. The Duchy of Burgundy was also a French fiefdom and immediately claimed by Charles VIII. The first phase of this conflict would last until 1489, keeping Maximilian occupied in the Low Countries. He even fell into the hands of his enemies and was held prisor for four months in Bruges in 1488. He was freed only when his father sent an army under the command of Duke Albert of Saxony to his rescue. Maximilian subsequently returned to Germany, leaving his cousin Albert as his representative. Albert would, in the following years, manage to assert the Habsburg hegemony in the Netherlands.Thieme, A.: Albrecht (der Beherzte) , S√§chsische Biografie; Institut f√ºr S√§chsische Geschichte und Volkskunde e.V. URL last accessed 2006-10-06 Maximilian had been elected King of the Romans in 1486 on his father's initiative, and they had been ruling jointly since then. Upon the death of Frederick in 1493, Maximilian also took over his father's possessions and thus united the whole Habsburg territory in his hands. In the same year, the Peace of Senlis also marked the end of his wars against the French about his Burgundian possessions; he kept the territories in the Netherlands and also the County of Burgundy, but had to cede the Duchy of Burgundy to the French king. Maximilian controlled thus territories that nearly encircled the Old Swiss Confederacy: Tyrol and Vorarlberg in the east, Further Austria in the north, and the County of Burgundy in the west. Swabia and the Swiss When asked by Emperor Frederick to also join the Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they saw no reason to join an alliance designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule. On the Swabian side, similar concerns existed. For the common people in Swabia, the independence and freedom of the Eidgenossen was a powerful and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern Swabia feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy.Maissen, Th.: Worum ging es im Schwabenkrieg?, NZZ of September 18, 1999. In German; reprint at historicum.net. URL last accessed 2006-09-17. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities as far away as Rottweil (1463) and Mulhouse (1466). The city of Constance and its bishop were caught in the middle between these two blocks: they held possessions in Swabia, but the city also still exercised the high justice over the Thurgau, where the Swiss had assumed the low justice since the annexation in 1460. The foundation of the Swabian League prompted the Swiss city states of Z√ºrich and Bern to propose accepting Constance into the Swiss Confederacy. The negotiations failed, though, due to the opposition of the founding cantons of the Confederacy and Uri in particular. The split jurisdiction over the Thurgau was the cause of many quarrels between the city and the Confederacy. In 1495, one such disagreement was answered by a punitive expedition of soldiers of Uri and the city had to pay the sum of 3,000 guilders to make them retreat and cease their plundering. (The Thurgau was a condominium of the Swiss Confederacy, and Uri was one of the cantons involved in its administration.) Finally, Constance joined the Swabian League as a full member on November 3, 1498. Although this did not yet definitively define the position of the city-- during the Reformation, it would be allied again with Z√ºrich and Bern, and only after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League in 1548 its close connections to the Eidgenossenschaft would be finally severed--it was another factor contributing to the growing estrangement between the Swiss and the Swabians. The competition between Swiss (Reisl√§ufer) and Swabian mercenaries (Landsknechte), who both fought in armies throughout Europe, sometimes opposing each other on the battlefield, sometimes competing for contracts, intensified. Contemporary chronicles agree in their reports that the Swiss, who were considered the best soldiers in Europe at the time after their victories in the Burgundian Wars, were subject to many taunts and abuses by the Landsknechte; they were called \\"Kuhschweizer\\" and ridiculed in other ways.Walter, H.: Der Topos vom \\"Kuhschweizer\\" ; University of Z√ºrich, 2000. URL last accessed 2006-09-17. Such insults were neither given nor taken lightly, and frequently led to bloodshed. Indeed, such incidents would contribute to prolong the Swabian War itself by triggering skirmishes and looting expeditions that the military commands of neither side had ever wanted or planned.St√ºssi-Lauterburg, J.: Der Schwabenkrieg 1499, 1999.

Imperial reform of 1495 Emperor Maximilian I in a painting from 1519 by Albrecht D√ºrer Maximilian I, like other Holy Roman Emperors before and after him, had to face struggles with other powerful princes in the empire and he thus sought to secure his position and the imperial monarchy by furthering centralisation.Sachse, G.: Kaiser Maximilian I - Bewahrer und Reformer, Kulturberichte 2/02, AsKI 2002. URL last accessed 2006-10-06. At the Imperial Diet held in Worms in 1495, he was partly successful, but he also had to make concessions in favor of the princes. The imperial reform proclaimed an \\"eternal public peace\\" (Ewiger Landfriede) to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing Imperial Army to enforce that peace, to which each imperial estate (Reichsstand) would have had to send troops. It also mandated the common penny (Reichspfennig), a new head tax to finance this army. Among the concessions Maximilian had to make was the institution of a new supreme court, the Reichskammergericht, thus separating the highest judicial authority from the person and the whereabouts of the emperor. He also had to agree to the formation of a governmental council of princes called the Reichsregiment. It would never play a significant role: it convened for the first time in 1500, but was dissolved by Maximilian two years later. The Swiss did not accept these resolutions of the Imperial Diet, and they explicitly refused to pay the common penny. URL last accessed 2006-10-06. They had no interest whatsoever in sending troops to serve in an army under Habsburg authority, nor in paying taxes, nor would they accept any foreign court's jurisdiction; and they had succeeded in securing public peace within their territories reasonably well by themselves. They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who refused to accept the resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later as a pretext to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (Reichsacht). Course of the war Theater of the Swabian War during 1499 Open war broke out over a territorial conflict in the Grisons, where during the 15th century a federation similar to the Eidgenossenschaft had developed. Like the Swiss, these Three Leagues had achieved a far-reaching autonomy, but also were involved in constant struggles with the Habsburgs, who ruled the neighbouring territories to the east and who kept trying to bring the Grisons under their influence. During the 1470s and 1480s, Duke Sigismund had succeeded in acquiring step by step the high justice over most of the communes of the Zehngerichtebund (\\"League of the Ten Jurisdictions\\" in the Pr√§ttigau, the youngest of the Three Leagues that had sprung up in the Grisons, having been founded only in 1436), and Maximilian continued this expansionist strategy. The Habsburg pressure prompted the Three Leagues to sign a close military alliance with the Swiss Confederacy in 1497-98.. URL last accessed 2006-10-09. At the same time, the Habsburgs had been involved in a major power struggle with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control of the remains of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs directly involved in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy of Milan. As a direct connection between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons and in particular the Val M√ºstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val M√ºstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at M√ºstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau. But the Three Leagues had already called upon the Swiss for help and troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon learning about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers on their way back home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the Swiss, the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, Swiss troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards Lake Constance, pillaging and plundering along the way. On February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the Battle of Hard on the shores of Lake Constance near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other Swiss troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the Swiss retreated after a few days. Women and priests retrieve the dead bodies of Swabian soldiers just outside the city gates of Constance after the battle of Schwaderloh. (Luzerner Schilling). Meanwhile, the Swabian League had completed its recruitment, and undertook a raid on Dornach on March 22, but suffered a defeat against numerically inferior Swiss troops in the Battle of Bruderholz that same evening. In early April, both sides raided each other's territories along the Rhine; the Swiss conquered the villages of Hallau and Neunkirch in the Klettgau west of Schaffhausen. A larger attack of the Swabian League took place on April 11, 1499: the Swabian troops occupied and plundered some villages on the southern shore of Lake Constance, just south of Constance. The expedition ended in a shameful defeat and open flightRiezler, S.: Die Grafen von F√ºrstenberg im Schweizerkriege 1499; T√ºbingen 1883. In German, from historicum.net. Detailed chronological account of events. when the Swiss soldiers, who had their main camp just a few miles south at Schwaderloh, arrived and met the Swabians in the Battle of Schwaderloh. The Swabians lost more than 1,000 soldiers; 130 from the city of Constance alone; and the Swiss captured their heavy equipment, including their artillery. Again, the Swiss raided the Klettgau and the Hegau and pillaged several fortified smaller Swabian cities such as Tiengen or St√ºhlingen before retreating again. This whole war was characterized by many such smaller raids and plundering expeditions of both sides between a few larger battles. On the eastern front, a new Habsburg attack on the Rhine valley provoked a counterstrike of the Eidgenossen, who remained victorious in the Battle of Frastanz near Feldkirch on April 20, 1499. The continued defeats of both Habsburg and Swabian armies made King Maximilian, who had hitherto been occupied in the Netherlands, travel to Constance and assume the leadership of the operations himself. He declared an imperial ban over the Swiss Confederacy in an attempt to gain wider support for the operation amongst the German princes by declaring the conflict an \\"imperial war\\". However, this move had no success. Maximilian then decided that the next decisive attack should take place again in the Val M√ºstair, since he didn't have enough troops near Constance to risk attacking there. An abandoned attack attempt in the west in early May 1499 had drawn significant Swiss forces there, who subsequently raided the Sundgau. On May 21, the Swiss undertook a third raid in the Hegau, but abandoned the operation one week later after the city of Stockach withstood a siege long enough for Swabian relief troops to come dangerously close.Wendler, U.: Der dritte Hegauzug und K√∂nig Maximilian I.; in German. URL last accessed 2006-10-09. Simultaneously, the Three Leagues attacked the Habsburg troops that camped again at Glurns on May 22, 1499, before Maximilian could arrive with reinforcements. They overran the fortifications and routed the Austrian army in the Battle of Calven and then ravaged the Vinschgau, before retreating after three days. Maximilian and his troops arrived one week later, on May 29. In revenge, his troops pillaged the Engadin valley, but retreated quickly before reinforcements from the Swiss Confederacy arrived. The refusal of the military leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front to send them to the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val M√ºstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.

The defenders jump for their lives, while the village goes up in flames. (Luzerner Schilling). By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders suddenly were under pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army under the command of Count Heinrich von F√ºrstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act. An attack by sea across Lake Constance on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 was one of the few successful Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was taken by surprise, the villages plundered and burnt. A much larger attack of an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the Battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long and hard battle. Their general Heinrich von F√ºrstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again. One of the last skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of defenders was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up long enough for the Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle. A major problem for the Swiss was the lack of any unified command. The cantonal contingents only took orders from their own leaders. Complaints of insubordination were common. The Swiss Diet had to adopt this resolution on 11 March 1499: \\"Every canton shall impress upon its soldiers that when the Confederates are under arms together, each one of them, whatever his canton, shall obey the officers of the others.\\"William E. Rappard, Collective Security in Swiss Experience 1291-1948 (London, 1948) pp. 88-89 The war was paid for largely by the French and Italian allies of the Swiss as well as by ransoming prisoners of war. Peace negotiations Early mediation attempts in March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But after the Battle of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499. The Milanese envoy presents his peace proposals to Maximilian's delegation at the city hall of Basel. A delegate from Lucerne (front left, in the blue-white dress) translates. (Luzerner Schilling). However, events in the Italian Wars helped bring the Swabian War to an end. The French king Louis XII tried to bring the Duchy of Milan under his control. As long as the Swabian War continued, the Milanese ruler Ludovico il Moro--whose niece Bianca Maximilian had married in 1493--could not expect help from either Swiss mercenaries or Maximilian, and thus his envoy Galeazzo Visconti tried to mediate between the Swiss and the king. The French delegation at the Tagsatzung, the federal diet and war council of the Swiss, tried to prevent any agreement for the same reason. The Milanese delegation prevailed in these intrigations and succeeded to persuade both sides to moderate their demands. Finally, a peace treaty between Maximilian I and the Swiss was signed in Basel on September 22, 1499. The peace treaty carefully played down the whole war from the \\"imperial war\\" that Maximilian had tried to make it by declaring the ban over the Confederacy to what it actually was: a war between two equal members of the empire (Imperial estate, or Reichsst√§nde), namely the House of Habsburg and the Swiss Confederacy. The document referred to Maximilian only as \\"duke of Habsburg\\", not as \\"king of the Germans\\" or even \\"Holy Roman Emperor\\". With the Peace of Basel, the relations between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the empire returned to the status quo ante from before the Diet of Worms in 1495. The imperial ban was dropped silently. Maximilian had to accept the refusal of the cantons and to abandon implicitly the Habsburg claims on their territories, acknowledging their independence. Consequently, the then ten members of the Swiss Confederacy remained exempt from the jurisdiction of the Reichskammergericht. The Swiss henceforth exercised also the high justice over the Thurgau. The war had not caused any territorial changes, except in the area around Schaffhausen, where the city had succeeded to assert its hegemony over some places that had formerly belonged to the Bishop of Constance.Scheck, P.: Der Schwabenkrieg 1499; Municipal Archives of Schaffhausen, 1999. In German. URL last accessed 2006-09-08. In the Grisons, the situation also reverted to pre-war conditions. The Habsburgs could keep their rights over eight of the communes of the Zehngerichtebund, but also had to accept that league's alliance with the two other leagues and with the Swiss Confederacy. Ultimately, this arrangement would lead to the Habsburgs losing the Pr√§ttigau to the Three Leagues, with the exception of a temporary re- occupation during the Thirty Years' War nearly 130 years later. Further consequences The Swiss Confederacy formally remained a part of the Holy Roman Empire, as shown by this stack of crests from 1596 on the main gate of castle Lenzburg: the Imperial eagle of the Holy Roman Empire tops the bears of Bern. At the bottom, the coat of arms of the von Erlach family. After 1648, the practice of placing the imperial insignia atop the confederate emblems was gradually abandoned and used less and less frequently and mainly for traditional reasons until the early 18th century.Meles, B.: Das Entschwinden des Reichsadlers, pp. 147 - 162 in Jorio, M.: 1648: Die Schweiz und Europa: Aussenpolitik zur Zeit des Westf√§lischen Friedens, Chronos Verlag, Z√ºrich 1999; . In German. Basel had remained studiously neutral throughout the whole war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further down along the Rhine. But the events of the war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract,State Archive of Basel-Country: Vertrag zwischen Basel und der Eidgenossenschaft 1501; August 2000. Also see the Bundesbrief of Basel itself (PDF file, 553 kB). In German. which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501. Schaffhausen had fought alongside the Eidgenossen during the Swabian War, and thus its acceptance into the Confederacy was a mere formality. The city had been an imperial city since 1415 and an associate state of the Confederacy since 1454 through a 25-year contract that had been renewed in 1479. On August 10, 1501, it became the twelfth member of the Confederacy. With the end of the war, the Swiss troops were no longer bound along the Rhine and in the Grisons. The cantons concluded new mercenary contracts, so called capitulations, with the Duchy of Milan and soon got deeply involved in the Italian Wars, where Swiss mercenaries ended up fighting on both sides. The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in its own interests in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries from individual cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) in the service of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular in the service of the French king. The Swiss Confederacy remained an independent Reichsstand of the Holy Roman Empire, but as it was not even obliged to participate in the Imperial Diet, this relation was degraded to a purely formal one that would lose significance throughout the 16th century. However, the Swiss still considered themselves as members of the empire with the status of imperial immediacy; the empire was still considered the foundation of all privileges, rights, or political identity as can be witnessed in the continued use of the imperial insignia. The relations between the Habsburgs and the Confederacy were fully normalized in the Erbeinung of 1511, a renewal of the earlier Ewige Richtung of 1474 and a first Erbeinung of 1477. In that treaty, the Habsburgs finally and officially gave up all their territorial claims of old, and even designated the Confederacy the protecting power of the County of Burgundy. In the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, all members and associate states of the Confederacy would gain official full exemption from the empire and recognition as a national and political entity on their own right.

The disease gives infected organisms a dusty, brownish-gold color. The disease occurs most commonly in tropical fish, and to a lesser extent, marine aquaria. Life cycle The single-celled parasite's life cycle can be divided into three major phases. First, as a tomont, the parasite rests at the water's floor and divides into as many as 256 tomites. Second, these juvenile, motile tomites swim about in search of a fish host, meanwhile using photosynthesis to grow, and to fuel their search. Finally, the adolescent tomite finds and enters the slime coat of a host fish, dissolving and consuming the host's cells, and needing only three days to reach full maturity before detaching to become a tomont once more. Pathology A 15-day old Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) with velvet disease Velvet (in an aquarium environment) is usually spread by contaminated tanks, fish, and tools (such as nets or testing supplies). There are also rare reports of frozen live foods (such as bloodworms) containing dormant forms of the species. Frequently, however, the parasite is endemic to a fish, and only causes a noticeable \\"outbreak\\" after the fish's immune system is compromised for some other reason. The disease is highly contagious and can prove fatal to fish. Symptoms Adult Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) with velvet disease Initially, infected fish are known to \\"flash\\", or sporadically dart from one end of an aquarium to another, scratching against objects in order to relieve their discomfort. They will also \\"clamp\\" their fins very close to their body, and exhibit lethargy. If untreated, a 'dusting' of particles (which are in fact the parasites) will be seen all over the infected fish, ranging in color from brown to gold to green. In the most advanced stages, fish will have difficulty respiring, will often refuse food, and will eventually die of hypoxia due to necrosis of their gill tissue. Treatment Sodium chloride (table/sea salt) is believed to mitigate the reproduction of velvet, however this treatment is not itself sufficient for the complete eradication of an outbreak. Additional, common medications added directly to the fish's environment include copper sulfate, methylene blue, formalin, malachite green and acriflavin, all of which can be found in common fish medications designed specifically to combat this disease. Additionally, because velvet parasites derive a portion of their energy from photosynthesis, leaving a tank in total darkness for seven days provides a helpful supplement to chemical curatives. Finally, some enthusiasts recommend raising the water temperature of an infected fish's environment, in order to quicken the life cycle (and subsequent death) of velvet parasites; however this tactic is not practical for all fish, and may induce immunocompromising stress.

Spikkestad railway station was opened in 1885 to link Asker to Drammen. The village was named after the farm \\"Spikkestad\\", as the station was built on its lands. In the early 1970s, a tunnel was built which made the trip between these places shorter, and most of the train track was closed. Spikkestad became the end terminus of Spikkestadbanen, and there are still trains running every half- hour. Spikkestad is also accessible by car. It is only a short trip off the Norwegian National Road 23 (Riksvei 23), which links Drammen and Dr√∏bak. Drammen is the closest large city, only 11 km away from Spikkestad. During the industrialization of the town at the end of the 19th century, factories and schools, as well as an influx of new inhabitants made the village into more than just a train station. The manufacturing company Elopak was founded in Spikkestad in 1957. Spikkestad and the area surrounding it have a long history dating back to the viking era.

(or RSG!) was a British rock/pop music television programme broadcast every Friday evening from 9 August 1963 until 23 December 1966. It was conceived by Elkan Allan, head of Rediffusion TV. Allan wanted a light entertainment programme different from the low-brow style of light entertainment transmitted by ATV. The programme was produced without scenery or costumes and with a minimum of choreography and make-up. Allan recruited a fellow journalist, Francis Hitching, as producer. Hitching became a major figure in light entertainment in the 1960s. Robert Fleming was the first director, followed by the documentary director Rollo Gamble, then Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Daphne Shadwell and Peter Croft. The programme was produced by Associated-Rediffusion, the weekday ITV contractor for London, called Rediffusion-London after 1964. The live show was eventually networked nationally. The show gained its highest ratings on 20 March 1964 when it featured the Beatles being interviewed and performing \\"It Won't Be Long\\", \\"You Can't Do That\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" - the last a hit at the time. RSG! USA! was a Dick Clark production in 1964. A trademark infringement suit ended the show after six episodes. In the 1980s Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five acquired the rights to the 1960s UK music show and bought the rights to the surviving recordings. On 10 January 2018, BMG Rights Management announced that it had acquired the ancillary rights to Ready, Steady, Go!  Description  The show went out early on Friday evenings with the line \\"The weekend starts here!\\", and was introduced by the Surfaris' \\"Wipe Out\\", later by Manfred Mann's \\"5-4-3-2-1\\", then Manfred Mann's \\"Hubble Bubble (Toil and Trouble)\\", and finally The Rolling Stones \\"Goin' Home\\". There is also the possibility that The Who's \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" was used as the theme music for a short period. It was more youth-orientated and informal than its BBC rival (from 1964), Top of the Pops. It was notable for featuring the audience as dancers, and for the interaction of artists and audience. Artists appeared on different mini-stages, sometimes on studio gantries and stairs, or on the main floor for solo artists, closely surrounded by the audience. The producers chose the audience in London clubs, picking out the best or the most fashionably dressed dancers. This ensured a hip audience in tune with the artists. Owing to scheduling of local news in parts of the UK, several ITV regions joined the show part-way through. Initially, RSG! artists mimed but by late 1964 some performed live and the show switched to all-live performances in April 1965.Tv.com Ready Steady Goes Live! Episode Number: 88 Season Num: 2 First Aired: 2 April 1965 - Accessed February 2007. It was noted for allowing artists to perform the full version of songs rather than short versions demanded by other shows. The programme was never broadcast in the United States, perhaps because it was in black and white when ABC, CBS and NBC were converting to full colour. The show was recorded at small studios in Rediffusion's headquarters in Kingsway, London. Although the company had bigger facilities at Wembley in the west of the capital, it was easier to attract stars and audiences to central London. As the studios were compact it was not possible to hide cameras.https://flashbak.com/weekend-starts-fabulous- photos-classic-pop-tv-show-ready-steady-go-361445/ The ever-present cameras, which were large with rotating lens turrets rather than zooms, were sometimes incorporated into the action, notably in a Manfred Mann performance of Machines which ended with Paul Jones singing crouched on the floor surrounded by cameras. RSG was originally from Studio 9 in Kingsway when artists mimed; it later moved to Studio 5 at Wembley, enabling artists to perform live. Artists' own recorded backing tracks were not allowed by the Musicians' Union so the whole of Studio 5 (normally divided into 5a and 5b) was used so an orchestra could perform the backing live.https://flashbak.com/weekend-starts- fabulous-photos-classic-pop-tv-show-ready-steady-go-361445/ The show was popular among young people. It had a particular following among the mod youth subculture of the 1960s.Ready Steady Gone Johnnie Taylor, Modculture.com, Accessed April 2011 In late 1966, when the 'beat boom' was fading, the show was cancelled, despite its popularity. Compilations were broadcast on Channel 4 in the 1990s and VHS videos included a Beatles live special and The Sounds of Motown special edition. In 1989 the show was seen for the first time in the US, on Disney Channel. During that time, Disney was a pay channel aimed at adults at night. Ready Steady Go! has not been officially released on DVD.  Origin of \\"The Weekend Starts Here\\"  After the recording of the pilot episode on Tuesday July 16, 1963 Keith Fordyce approached a group of Mods who had travelled from Sheffield's King Mojo club and asked 'so you chaps have come all the way from Sheffield on a Tuesday no less. I expect you'll be eager to go home and get back to work, what with the weekend coming up and all.' John Varney, Sheffield 'Ace Face' replied 'are you kidding mate - the weekend starts here' and the slogan was born. Over the next three years Pete Stringfellow and the Sheffield Mojo crowd were regulars on the now renamed 'Ready Steady Go'.https://flashbak.com/weekend-starts-fabulous-photos-classic- pop-tv-show-ready-steady-go-361445/  Presenters and producers  The best known presenters were Keith Fordyce and Cathy McGowan, though early shows were introduced by Dusty Springfield. The show was occasionally presented by David Gell and Michael Aldred. Both McGowan and Aldred joined after answering an advertisement for \\"a typical teenager\\" as adviser. They found themselves presenting the show, and McGowan's status as a fan was evident in her style; stumbling over lines, losing her cool and her inexperience made her more rather than less popular, and by the end she was presenting alone. She also joined in fun and games, including miming with the Rolling Stones to other people's records, notably \\"I Got You Babe\\".  Featured artists  Manfred Mann performing at RSG! studio.

Three years later, after Coe's disappearance made the front page of the Daily Mirror, McCartney used the article as the basis for \\"She's Leaving Home\\". Jimi Hendrix made his first television appearance in Britain on RSG! with \\"Hey Joe\\", performing live. After this, his club tour sold out and he was added to a nationwide tour by the Walker Brothers. Dusty Springfield devised and introduced the RSG Motown Special in April 1965, featuring the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, the Miracles and Martha and the Vandellas, which was a VHS video in the 1980s.Ready Steady Go! Special Edition - The Sounds of Motown The Supremes performed their \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" dance routine for the first time on the show...and The Miracles closed the show with their hit,\\"Mickey's Monkey.\\" The Who proved particularly popular, making the most appearances of any artist - a total of 18 between January 1965 and December 1966. The band had an episode to themselves entitled Ready Steady Who, broadcast in October 1966. The band also released an EP of the same name; despite the title all of the tracks were studio recordings which had been made previously.https://www.thewho.com/music/ready-steady-who-ep/ The Walker Brothers were also popular and had a live edition in 1966 but the tape was wiped, although extracts surfaced on YouTube in 2009 proving the group did not mime. On 20 March 2020, BBC Four had a documentary on about Ready Steady Go, with original clips, plus interviews with Martha Reeves, Mary Wilson, Paul Jones, Chris Farlowe, Vicki Wickham, Annie Nightingale & Michael Lindsay Hogg.https://theartsdesk.com/tv/story-ready-steady-go-bbc-four-review-when- life-was-fab In popular culture * In 1965 the programme was parodied in The Benny Hill Show.

It began as a loose organization modeled after the British National Front. Heick began working with Tom Metzger's White Aryan Resistance (WAR) in 1988. Heick and artist Boyd Rice posed for photos in AF uniforms for an article on neo-Nazism in Sassy magazine. Rice claims he was never really a member of the American Front, but that he was friends with Heick. History In 1985, after years of associating with peers of all races, Bob Heick began writing and distributing leaflets, mostly from a nationalist anti-communist stance, in response to the increasing leftist influence in the local punk subculture. Originally intended as an umbrella organization for all American skinheads, AF had no formal structure or membership. In San Francisco, Heick lost favor with the mostly apolitical skinheads. Media attention and constant vandalism and assault (such as breaking the windows of the Bound Together anarchist bookstore and harassing interracial couples in the Haight-Ashbury) by the group brought increased attention from the local police.Spitfire List--Dave Emory Blog (also has picture of Bob Heick and Boyd Rice): In addition, Heick's progression from patriotism to Nazism lost him many friends, and some people accused him of trying to take over the local skinhead scene. Heick then started associating with heavy metal music fans and rural white workers. He formed the short-lived group United White Brethren in the North and South Bay Areas. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1987, Heick found the newer generation of local skinheads to be more receptive to Nazism. The AF transformed into a political organization, and its membership was no longer exclusively skinheads. On the AF telephone hotline, at the end of the telephone message, the voice of Heick asked \\"Do you have hate in your heart?\\" The AF telephone hotline often repeated a quote from the San Francisco-born author Jack London: \\"I'm a worker, but first of all I'm a white worker\\". On May 1, 1988, AF held its first White Workers Day march on Haight Street in San Francisco, in which 65 participants, which included a few long haired white hippies who had spontaneously joined the march, marched unopposed. This was heralded by Tom Metzger of White Aryan Resistance on his telephone hotline, in the WAR newspaper, and on television. The AF tabloid Aryan Warrior was published soon after. Metzger began presenting Heick to the media as a spokesman for white power skinheads. Heick appeared on the TV news magazine The Reporters, in a segment that mainly focused on Heick and included footage of the Mayday march. AF was also featured in publications such as Rolling Stone, Hustler, and Sassy. By 1989, there were AF units in 14 American states. Aryan Woodstock Heick started to organize a concert of white power bands on rural land near Napa, California, a suburb of San Francisco in the northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area. Heick was pushed aside by Tom Metzger, and the concert became a White Aryan Resistance event instead of an AF event. Heick and Metzger disagreed on almost every facet of the festival, including the name, Aryan Woodstock. Heick disagreed with Metzger's promotion of the event on his phone hotline, because it was monitored by anti-racist activists, and would give them time to organize against the event. A WAR activist was told by three bureaucrats that no permit would be required to play live music at a private event on private land, as long as sanitation was provided for. During the two weeks leading up to Aryan Woodstock, the event was a leading local news story. Napa County sought an injunction to block the gathering, and Heick appeared before a judge to defend AF and WAR's right to assemble. The judge ruled that the gathering may take place, but that there could be no music.New York Times‚ÄîMarch 4th 1989‚Äî‚ÄúJudge Blocks Neo-Nazi Woodstock in California‚Äù: Approximately 300 people from across the United States arrived on the property before the landowner caved to police pressure and allowed the authorities to close off the entrance. This stranded many would-be attendees, some who had traveled great distances to be there. Several hundred protesters were outside the property. Tension between AF and WAR increased soon after. Heick spent the next year visiting various AF units in California and across the United States before getting married and settling down in Portland, Oregon. 1990s In 1990, Heick announced on the AF telephone hotline that the group would appear in San Francisco's Union Square on the first Saturday in May. The message ran for a month prior to the event. Opponents of the AF held a Mayday demonstration three days prior, on May 1. On the day of the AF event, Heick arrived with 10 men and three women, and marched into 300 missile-throwing protesters. Police, seeing that the AF contingent was completely surrounded by violent counter protesters, moved in and encircled AF, separating the two groups. At this point, both the AF and SFPD were vastly outnumbered by counter protesters, who were hurling rocks, bottles and attacking both the officers and AF with 2x4 sign posts. Back-up officers began arriving on the scene and the police were able to get a patrol wagon into the park. All 13 AF members scrambled into the wagon (without handcuffs) and were whisked away for their own safety. Officers fought off the continuing attacks of the counter protesters who then fled the scene. There were a number of injuries on all sides. In October 1990, The Coalition for Human Dignity published fliers featuring Heick's new home address in Portland, Oregon, and distributed press releases announcing his arrival. Local TV news crews arrived at Heick's apartment a few days after he moved in. Heick still received regular invitations to appear on national television, but many of the new offers were to appear on trash TV shows. Heick refused those offers, restricting his interviews to genuine news programs. He has appeared on the Geraldo Rivera Show even though as stated before, he denied most offers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zmjFIen9Oo As press interest in Heick and AF waned, Heick focused on local activism. AF's 1991 May Day demonstration was held in Portland. There was a large counter protest, but no violence. In 1992, Heick and AF associates were the first out-of-state activists to arrive at the Randy Weaver stand-off at Ruby Ridge. Heick blockaded a fuel truck and lambasted the driver for supporting the government. Around this time, AF focused on demonstrations and literature distribution. The group's telephone hotline was revived in Portland and remained active until Heick left the group in 1995. In the 1990s, the Washington and California AF sections published The Voice of Revolution magazine, which had strong ties to Combat 18 in England. In New York, Jim Porazzo published Greystorm. In Portland, Heick published Revolutionary Nationalist AF focused on opposing hate crime laws, which they claimed only targeted whites. AF became known for harassing Portland city commissioner Mike Lindberg, who called the group \\"gay bashing skinheads\\" in the press. The Albany, Oregon area AF unit held regular demonstrations. AF briefly resurfaced under the leadership of Porazzo, who moved the group to Harrison, Arkansas and began to promote Third Positionism. 2000s On May 5, 2012, ten members of the Florida branch of the American Front were arrested in St. Cloud, Florida, 25 miles from the Walt Disney World theme parks, and charged with paramilitary training, shooting into an occupied dwelling and evidence of prejudices while committing an offense.Liston, Barbara Florida nabs white supremacists planning \\"race war\\" Reuters.

(2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The specific epithet oxycedrus means \\"sharp cedar\\" and this species may have been the original cedar or cedrus of the ancient Greeks.Meiggs, R. 1982. Trees and Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean World. Description Juniperus oxycedrus is very variable in shape, forming a spreading shrub tall to a small erect tree tall. It has needle-like leaves in whorls of three; the leaves are green, long and broad, with a double white stomatal band (split by a green midrib) on the inner surface. It is usually dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The seed cones are berry-like, green ripening in 18 months to orange- red with a variable pink waxy coating; they are spherical, diameter, and have three or six fused scales in 1-2 whorls, three of the scales with a single seed. The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard seeds in their droppings. The pollen cones are yellow, long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in late winter or early spring.Adams, R. P. (2004). Junipers of the World. Trafford.

Subspecies An additional variety or subspecies J. oxycedrus var. badia H.Gay (syn. J. oxycedrus subsp. badia (H.Gay) Debeaux) is distinguished on the basis of larger cones ( diameter), tinged purple when mature; it is described from northern Algeria, and also reported from Portugal and Spain. A further species Juniperus macrocarpa, confined to Mediterranean coastal sands, is more distinct but has also often been treated as a subspecies of Prickly Juniper, as J. oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa; it differs in the broader leaves wide, and larger cones diameter. Other close relatives of J. oxycedrus include Juniperus brevifolia on the Azores, Juniperus cedrus on the Canary Islands and Juniperus formosana in eastern Asia.

Winzen and General Mills, Inc. They were used by the United States Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR) in the late 1940s and 1950s for atmospheric research, especially for constant-level meteorological observations at very high altitudes. Instruments like the Cherenkov detector were first used on Skyhook balloons.  Project Skyhook  In the late 1940s, Project Skyhook was conceived of as a means by which plastic balloons could be used to transmit or send instruments into the stratosphere to conduct research. This project carried forward work from an earlier project, Helios, that General Mills and Jean Piccard initiated to use arrays of giant plastic balloons to carry humans aloft. Balloons, long used for collecting meteorological data, now offered the opportunity of collecting highly specialized information and photographs. The first Skyhook balloon was launched on September 25, 1947. The balloon was developed by the Aeronautical Division of General Mills.Final Report: Project 85012, Report No. 1227, General Mills, Inc, Mechanical Division, Engineering Research & Development Department, September 4, 1953. It carried a payload of nuclear emulsion to over . At low level immediately after launch, the lifting gas (hydrogen or helium) in the balloons formed a small bubble at the top of the envelope, resulting in the balloon having a \\"limp\\" look. At the lower air pressure at higher altitudes, the gas expanded and eventually filled the whole envelope forming a sphere or ovoid. In some models the balloons could reach diameters of more than 30 m.'Sunday Ship History: Skyhooked', EagleSpeak.us website, January 21, 2008. In the succeeding 10 years, over 1,500 Skyhook flights were made for investigations supported by the ONR and for European scientists. These flights were made from locations in the United States, Canada, and naval vessels in the Atlantic, Pacific, Caribbean, and Arctic waters. Both Winzen Research and General Mills participated in these launchings, and in later years, the Atomic Energy Commission joined ONR in support of Project Skyhook. USS Norton Sound (AVM-1) on March 31, 1949. Among significant flights, Project Skyhook launched the first successful three-balloon cluster in 1948. Then in 1949 the first shipboard Skyhook launch took place. It was followed by nearly 300 shipboard launchings over the next 10 years. The first manned plastic balloon flight under ONR contract took place in 1949. Project Rockoon, in 1952, featured a Skyhook balloon that released small Deacon rockets at about above arctic waters. One of the first known attempts to carry out an astrophysical measurement from a plastic balloon occurred under the Skyhook program on June 30, 1954. During the solar eclipse on that date two Skyhook balloons were launched by Winzen Research with camera gondolas employing simple orientating systems.Suomi, V. E and Beson, E. E. Astronomical Observations from a Skyhook Balloon. Winzen Research, Inc. Technical report #1150-R, February 1955 The objective was to photograph the eclipse from high altitude. Varied photographic equipment was carried and aimed at the Sun to obtain full coverage for the total period of totality.Ross, Malcolm D., Office of Naval Research. Plastic Balloons for Planetary Research. Presented at the Fourth Annual Meeting of the American Astronomical Society. January 31, 1958 On September 7, 1956, the University of Minnesota launched a giant Mylar balloon (developed by the G. T. Schejeldahl Corporation of Northfield, MN) to set an unofficial balloon altitude record of for unmanned balloons. In 1957 the US Navy began an operational aerology system known as Transosonde (trans- ocean sounding), consisting of almost daily balloon flights across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.  Project Stratoscope  On August 19, 1957, an unmanned Skyhook balloon lifted the first Project Stratoscope telescope. Project Stratoscope I was a program developed to research the Sun. Instruments included a 12-inch (30-centimeter) telescope with a special light-sensitive pointing system and a closed circuit television camera that was guided by the scientists on the ground. This was the first balloon-borne telescope. The telescope took more than 400 photographs of sunspots. These were the sharpest photographs taken of the Sun up to that time. The photographs increased scientists' understanding of the motions observed in the strong magnetic fields of the sunspots.  Project Churchy  In 1948 Skyhook balloons were used to show that in addition to protons and electrons, cosmic rays also include high energy atomic nuclei that are stripped of their electrons. Thirteen stratospheric plastic Skyhook balloons were launched in September 1953 as part of Project Churchy,Walt Kelly gave permission to use the name Churchy, the turtle character of his comic strip Pogo, as a nod to the turtles on the Galapagos Islands. an Office of Naval Research funded cosmic ray expedition at the geomagnetic equator. Project Churchy was conducted at the Gal√°pagos because high-energy cosmic-ray particles can only be collected at the geomagnetic equator without accompanying low-energy particles found at higher latitudes. Balloons carrying scientific instruments rose to between and and encountered temperatures as low as -80 ¬∞C (-112 ¬∞F). Aircraft from Patrol Squadron (VP) 45 ‚ÄòPelicans‚Äô took off an hour after the launch of each balloon and visually tracked the balloon until it released its cargo and deflated. The instruments were observed until splashdown, and marked for destroyers to retrieve.  Skyhook as UFO  Skyhook balloons may have been the origin of some UFO observations.

The Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program is a college-based, commissioned officer training program of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. Origins A pilot Naval Reserve unit was established in September 1924 at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. It let the Navy test the concept before establishing its regular units. In 1926, the U.S. Department of the Navy established the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. Its purpose was to produce a reserve of qualified officers who would be needed for a possible rapid expansion of the military in the case of an unforeseen emergency. A secondary objective was to acquaint college faculty and students with the Navy and its national importance. Sixty Naval Reserve Freshmen were accepted at each of the original units at the University of California, Berkeley, Northwestern University, University of Washington, Harvard University, Yale University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. Captain Chester W. Nimitz commanded the University of California NROTC unit. The first NROTC students received one uniform and (during their junior and senior years) a subsistence allowance totaling $210. They had the option of attending a fifteen-day training cruise each summer for which they would be paid seventy cents per day and a transportation allowance between their college and the ports of embarkation and debarkation. The St. John's College pilot unit disbanded by 1929, but the original six regular units are still active in 2014 (albeit with historical gaps at Harvard and Yale). Modern system Under the modern U.S. Naval ROTC system, graduates become active duty officers, rather than reserve officers, and are required to serve a term of 5 years for the Navy Option and 4 years for the Marine and Nurse Options. The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps commissions individuals into either the United States Navy as an Ensign or the United States Marine Corps as a Second Lieutenant. While attending college, these prospective officer candidates are known as Midshipmen. Whereas Naval Academy Midshipmen are on active duty, NROTC Midshipmen are in the Navy Reserve but are on active duty for periods of training during the summer. The primary difference is that NROTC Midshipmen attend an ordinary civilian college or university, whereas Naval Academy Midshipmen attend the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, which is a much more regimented, military environment. Starting in 2009, the scholarship program was changed to narrowly favor STEM degrees at the expense of the humanities. Joining the program The majority of NROTC Midshipmen join the program immediately after completing high school. Those Midshipmen are either Scholarship or College Program Midshipmen. Scholarship Midshipmen are those who applied to the Navy for an ROTC scholarship (during their senior year of high school, or during early college studies). Some NROTC students have served as enlisted men or women in the Navy or Marine Corps. The highly selective application process involves an extensive written application and an interview with a Navy representative. Applicants must also pass an entrance medical examination process. The Navy pays tuition for Scholarship Midshipmen, educational fees (i.e. lab fees), as well as a stipend for books. All Midshipmen fall under one of three types: Navy Option, Navy Nurse Option, or Marine Option. The Navy does not pay for room and board; however, some schools will offer scholarships to cover at least a portion of room and board. In addition to tuition, the Navy pays a monthly stipend during the school year. As of 2020, the stipend was $250 per month for first-year Midshipmen, with a $50 increase each year after that (i.e. $300/month for sophomores, and so on). College Program Midshipmen are those who join Naval ROTC without a scholarship. They complete all activities and requirements of scholarship midshipmen and if they continue in the program for four years will also be commissioned as Ensigns or Second Lieutenants. They will often be offered a scholarship by the Navy if they perform well academically and within the ROTC program. Because of the technical nature of the Navy, students entering college without a 4-year scholarship who are planning to major in a technical field, such as engineering, science, or math, are more competitive for the scholarships. Those enlisted in the Navy who are pursuing a commission through the Seaman to Admiral 21 (STA-21) participate in the ROTC program and are referred to as \\"Officer Candidates.\\" They retain their enlisted pay. Enlisted Marines participate in ROTC through the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Education Program (MECEP) and are referred to by their rank or by the name of the program, \\"MECEP.\\" (pronounced mee-sep) MECEP Marines do not have their school paid for by the Marine Corps and generally use the Montgomery GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for school. They continue to receive pay in accordance with their rank, however any promotions while they are attending school are considered non-competitive and will be revoked if they fail out of the commissioning program. The program=During the school year Most college NROTC units are only a part-time commitment during a student's course of study at a university or college. There are three basic parts to a student's ROTC commitment in a typical week: One or in some cases two days a week are set aside as uniform days, where the midshipmen spend several hours attending military training such as inspections, close-order drill practices, and training lectures (either by officers attached to the NROTC unit or guest lecturers). The training is usually in the late afternoon after most classes have ended for the day, or in early mornings before classes. It is common for Marine Option midshipmen and MECEPs to have an additional training period for Marine-specific training. Usually one to three physical training sessions are required in a week (depending on the specific NROTC unit), generally early in the morning. It is common for Marine Option midshipmen and MECEPs to have additional physical training days. In addition to those activities, there are regularly scheduled classes in Naval Science that must be taken on top of the usual college load. The classes are in Naval history, Naval engineering and weapons, leadership and ethics, and other areas. Besides Naval Science classes, the Navy requires its Midshipmen to complete 2 semesters of calculus, 2 semesters of calculus- based physics, one semester diverse cultures, one year of English grammar and composition, and either National Security Policy or American Military Affairs. The Marine Corps only requires National Security Policy/American Military Affairs classes for its midshipmen. There are other miscellaneous activities scheduled occasionally; some are voluntary and some are mandatory. =Military colleges= There are a few ROTC programs that do not follow this model, and instead require a full-time commitment from midshipmen during the school year. At a Senior Military College, the midshipmen are normally housed together with other ROTC cadets in barracks-like dormitories, a uniform is worn at least 5 days a week, and regular morning and evening formations are mandatory. At The Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute, cadets wear uniforms 7 days a week, live in a barracks, and are restricted to campus during the school week to focus on their studies and military training. Such full-time programs provide a more regimented existence that more closely simulates enlisted military life; they tend to be more demanding than normal college ROTC programs, in that they require extra commitments of time, physical and mental energy, etc. above and beyond most normal ROTC programs. Some midshipmen are drawn to these programs, which have a rich historical tradition behind them. Other students prefer standard NROTC programs, which allow them to focus more of their energy on academics rather than being limited by a regimented military life. Some notable full-time programs include the Corps of Cadets at The Citadel, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Tech, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Texas A&M; University, Texas A&M; Maritime Academy, SUNY Maritime College, Maine Maritime Academy, California Maritime Academy and Norwich University. During the summer NROTC students who are on scholarship participate in a summer cruise in the fleet, to get hands-on training with real Navy personnel and equipment. After their freshman year, Midshipmen (both Navy and Marine) travel to either San Diego or Norfolk for CORTRAMID (Career Orientation and Training of Midshipmen). The Midshipmen spend a week in each of the three primary Unrestricted Line communities (Surface, Submarine, and Aviation) as well as a week with the Marine Corps to help them decide which community to join when commissioned. In the next two summers, Navy Option scholarship midshipmen spend time with either a surface ship, submarine, or aviation squadron. Aviation cruises are only available to Midshipmen for their First Class Cruise. For each summer cruise, they select which warfare community they would prefer to train with and are given the opportunity to train around the world. The summer cruise in between the sophomore and junior years is referred to as the second-class cruise. They are assigned an enlisted running mate, from whom they acquire a sense of the enlisted experience. The summer cruise in between the junior and senior years of college (known as the First Class Cruise) is required for commissioning, and it focuses on integrating the midshipman into the officer community. Specialty cruises include EOD cruises, SEAL cruises, FOREX cruises (midshipmen are attached to a foreign country's ship), and Navy Nurse Cruises. Marine Option Midshipmen attend the Marine Corps' Mountain Warfare Training Center for the second summer. In recent years they have been attached to Marine units undergoing the summer training package. They learn high altitude survival techniques and undergo high altitude conditioning. It is often jokingly called \\"OCS prep.\\" Between the junior and senior years, Marine Option midshipmen attend \\"Bulldog,\\" Marine Officer Candidate School for six weeks. College Program midshipmen must either obtain the scholarship before their junior year or receive \\"advanced standing\\". In either case the midshipmen will only attend the first class summer cruise or OCS for Marine Options. Uniforms of midshipmen NROTC students are generally issued several types of uniforms, all for them to keep. The standard issue uniform is the poly/wool khaki, while Summer White and Service Dress Blue (commonly known as SDBs) are often seen on college campuses. Midshipmen wear a garrison cover with a fouled anchor for the Khakis, and a combination cover with a fouled anchor and a gold strap with the Whites and SDBs. Also newly issued to Midshipmen are the Navy's new Navy Working Uniform. Finally, Midshipmen are issued coveralls for preparation for their cruise, as well as an \\"N\\" ballcap and steel toed boots. Commitment The normal, \\"baseline\\" service commitment for Scholarship NROTC graduates is eight years, with no less than five served on active duty. The exact commitment will depend on which warfare community a midshipman is selected for. For example, Navy and Marine pilots are generally committed to eight years after their date of winging. Because the training for a Naval Aviator is extensive, this can lead to a commitment of up to 10 years. Naval Flight Officers usually serve a six-year commitment and Submarine Officers usually serve a five-year commitment. Commitment is also based on whether a midshipman is enrolled in the scholarship or college program. Those midshipmen who are in the college program typically only owe three years of active duty service. Once a naval officer completes their active duty commitment, they must serve the rest of their three years in some portion of the Navy Reserve.

He was one of the pioneers in the maritime industry and Israeli economy in general.Mano Maritime Ltd. - Company Profile Dun's 100 ranking: Dun & Bradstreet Biography Born into a shipping family from Thessaloniki, Greece, Mordechai was the son of Samuel Mano (1880-1962), who owned and operated from Thessaloniki, a fleet of ‚ÄúMaunas‚Äù, self-propelled barges, which served the Greek mainland and island ports. In 1932, when Mano was 9, his family immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, as part of the big immigration waves organized by Abba Hushi, an activist and leader of the Jewish Agency, in order to strengthen the Jewish working forces at the port of Haifa. Mordechai Mano received his knowledge and experience in the maritime industry from his father Samuel (1880-1962), who had worked at the shipping docks in Salonika. Samuel and his eldest brother, Morris, worked at the Haifa port till their retirement. Mano began his career as a messenger and a port clerk at the Nisim Meshulam shipping agency, and later at the shipping company Atid (which was established at 1934 by the Burhard family) where he studied all the secrets of the shipping trade. Spending days and nights working and learning every possible aspect of the business, combined with a lot of reading on the subject, Mano soon became an expert. He was known as a pioneer and as a man with vision and a special talent for getting on with people, making important business connections all around the world. One of his big advantages was a gift for languages. Mordechai spoke seven languages fluently (including Turkish and Arabic). In 1943, he established a shipping agency in Haifa called Mordechai Mano Shipping Agents on Ha Hazmaut Street, and later moved the company offices to 53 Ha Namal Street. The agency dealt with the free zone trade ships that arrived at Haifa and later purchased its first ship, a small wooden vessel, which was used primarily for the importing of the food products from Turkey in cooperation with the shipping agency Israel Gotesman and Sons, which dealt with the trade in food products during the austerity days of the early nineteen-fifties. Mano Holidings - Profile  History In 1956, the shipping company Netivei Hayam Hatihon (Mediterranean Seaways) was established in partnership with the Ofer Brothers Group, Mano was the company's administrator and senior partner. The company purchased a number of additional ships: ‚ÄúCarmela and Malka (named after his daughters), Eyal, Liora (named after Yuli Ofer's daughter Liora Ofer) and others. Netivei Hayam Hatihon established new routes and soon became a major carrier of cargo and freight to Israel through the Mediterranean and especially from the Adriatic. After the end of the Suez Crisis, an Israeli government initiative saw Mano organize an operation with the ship Panagaya, in which cement was transferred from Haifa to Eilat as an experimental transition of Israeli cargo and freight. This was recognized as a big success by the government. Mano was personally honored by Golda Meir, former prime minister of Israel. In 1965, the ownership of Nativei Hayam Hatichon was divided, and Mano established a new family company called Mano Nativei Yam. Some of the Nativei Hayam Hatichon ships were transferred to the new company with an addition of some chartered ships. The company managed those ships and also had an agency and part of an ownership in the ports of Haifa and Ashdod. By 1967, he had already established a prominent ship owning company with a substantial presence in the Mediterranean and global shipping arena. Mano died at the beginning of 1969. He left a wife, Ester Mano, two daughters, Carmela and Malka, two sons, Samuel Mano and Moshe Mano, and a grandson. His eldest son, Samuel, heads the Seagull Maritime company, Moshe is the owner of Mano Maritime, Pessah (Paul) Weissman, Mano's eldest son-in-law, manages the Hadar Maritime company, and Sami Niago, Mano‚Äôs son-in-law, manages Carmel Shipping company.

Let M be a complex manifold, and write OM for the sheaf of holomorphic functions on M. Let OM* be the subsheaf consisting of the non-vanishing holomorphic functions. These are both sheaves of abelian groups. The exponential function gives a sheaf homomorphism :\\\\exp : \\\\mathcal O_M \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_M^*, because for a holomorphic function f, exp(f) is a non-vanishing holomorphic function, and exp(f + g) = exp(f)exp(g). Its kernel is the sheaf 2œÄiZ of locally constant functions on M taking the values 2œÄin, with n an integer. The exponential sheaf sequence is therefore :0\\\\to 2\\\\pi i\\\\,\\\\mathbb Z \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_M\\\\to\\\\mathcal O_M^*\\\\to 0. The exponential mapping here is not always a surjective map on sections; this can be seen for example when M is a punctured disk in the complex plane. The exponential map is surjective on the stalks: Given a germ g of an holomorphic function at a point P such that g(P) ‚â† 0, one can take the logarithm of g in a neighborhood of P. The long exact sequence of sheaf cohomology shows that we have an exact sequence :\\\\cdots\\\\to H^0(\\\\mathcal O_U) \\\\to H^0(\\\\mathcal O_U^*)\\\\to H^1(2\\\\pi i\\\\,\\\\mathbb Z_U) \\\\to \\\\cdots for any open set U of M. Here H0 means simply the sections over U, and the sheaf cohomology H1(2œÄiZU) is the singular cohomology of U. One can think of H1(2œÄiZU) as associating an integer to each loop in U. For each section of OM*, the connecting homomorphism to H1(2œÄiZU) gives the winding number for each loop. So this homomorphism is therefore a generalized winding number and measures the failure of U to be contractible. In other words, there is a potential topological obstruction to taking a global logarithm of a non-vanishing holomorphic function, something that is always locally possible. A further consequence of the sequence is the exactness of :\\\\cdots\\\\to H^1(\\\\mathcal O_M)\\\\to H^1(\\\\mathcal O_M^*)\\\\to H^2(2\\\\pi i\\\\,\\\\mathbb Z)\\\\to \\\\cdots. Here H1(OM*) can be identified with the Picard group of holomorphic line bundles on M. The connecting homomorphism sends a line bundle to its first Chern class.

The harbour, 1934, National Gallery of Scotland. Sir William George Gillies (1898‚Äì1973) was a renowned Scottish landscape and still life painter. He is often referred to simply as W. G. Gillies. Life Gillies was born in Haddington, East Lothian. He had just enrolled at the Edinburgh College of Art, when he was called up for service in World War I with the Royal Engineers.A Chasm in Time - Scottish War Art and Artists in the Twentieth Century, by Patricia R. Andrew, Birlinn Ltd., 2014. After the War, he returned to the College, and after graduation taught there for over 40 years with other notable Scottish artists including Adam Bruce Thomson. He was Principal of the College from 1959 until his retirement in 1966. In 1922 along with nine fellow students, including William Crozier, William Geissler and William MacTaggart, he founded the 1922 Group, an exhibition society which promoted their works at the New GalleryThe 1922 Group, Seventh Exhibition, New Gallery, Shandwick Place (Closing Day 10 May 1929). Members: Arthur V. Couling, William Crozier, A.R.S.A, William Gillies, William Geissler, David W. Gunn, C. Wright Hall, William MacTaggart, John Maxwell, William G. Scoular, George C. Watson. in Edinburgh for the next ten years. Assisted by a travelling scholarship, Gillies studied under Andr√© Lhote in Paris in 1923 and he went on to visit Italy in 1924. For a brief period after these experiences he worked in a cubist manner, but would later revert to a more traditional style. His cubist influenced works are typified by the 1933 still life, Two Pots, Saucer and Fruit. The arrangement of the objects, which are close together on a tilted table top, are influenced by C√©zanne, whereas the understated colours and textures are reminiscent of Braque and Picasso. In 1934 Gillies attended an exhibition of Paul Klee's work and was impressed by the childlike qualities and imaginative use of colour that he saw. Klee's influence is clear in Gillies' 1934 work, The Harbour, which depicts the harbour at Anstruther. Gillies has created a grid-like composition, using bold blocks of contrasting colour emphasising the vertical lines of the buildings and the ships masts. This is balanced by the use of rippling horizontal brushstrokes. Although he experimented with portraiture in his early career, Gillies concentrated principally on landscapes and still lifes, frequently depicting the Lothian, Fife and Border regions. Several of his works feature ceramics created by his younger sister, the potter Emma Smith Gillies, who died prematurely in 1936. Both in his prolific output over the course of his career, and in his 40 years of teaching, Gillies influence on Scottish painting of the twentieth century has been profound.

Boyz was a Taiwanese pop/rap group composed of brothers Jeff Huang (ÈªÉÁ´ãÊàê, Huang Licheng) and Stanley Huang (ÈªÉÁ´ãË°å, Huang Lixing), and their cousin Steven Lin (ÊûóÊô∫Êñá) formed circa 1991. They are considered to be the first rap group in Taiwanese popular music. They released 13 albums (including 3 compilation albums) starting from their first \\"SHIAM! ÈñÉ\\" in 1992. Background The trio were brought up in Irvine, California and met at its University High School. They first became involved in music through their interest in hip-hop dance moves learnt from parties around Orange County and Los Angeles, and fashion from Compton and South-Central LA. Their dancing, and entry into various competitions, eventually led them to be scouted by a representative of Pony Canyon Records, Taiwan. Career=Breakthrough L.A. Boyz received their \\"big break ... with the demise of the Little Tigers, a cutesy group that ruled the Taiwan pop scene until one of their members got drafted.\\" Their distinct sound and use of American slang propelled them to quick success, selling more than 130,000 copies of their first record Shiam. Their second album, released in the same year, was similarly received. Image and style The L.A. Boyz style was a combination of the \\"youthful, innocent\\" look prevalent in Taiwanese pop at the time and a \\"great stage gimmick\\" in their dancing. They were perceived as an appealing hybrid of American and Taiwanese backgrounds. As Steven Lin noted in an interview with the LA Times in 1993, the perception Taiwanese youth had of Los Angeles as a symbol of modern America led them to choose their name (though only one of their members was from the city itself). Their music videos depict their unique style of synchronized breakdancing in clubs and concert halls and various urban environments. Shots of Kung-fu, Chinese New Year Dragons and baseball also feature. Musical style LA Boyz' music was influenced by a wide variety of pop and dance music. In their songs they make prominent references to new jack swing and Bobby Brown as well as techno and rap. A good example of their musical diversity is the song \\"Ya!\\", which features sampled breakbeats and vocals stings (such as \\"yeah, uh- huh\\", \\"give me a big beat!\\", \\"drop the mid-range, drop the bass\\"). It features transitions in tempo, a semitone key modulation, a Glissando synthesizer line, and a Hip-Hop section. Their song \\"I Like It\\" is a reinterpretation of the disco band KC and the Sunshine Band song \\"That's the Way (I Like It)\\" in a hip hop style. Despite being known for their rapping, \\"two-thirds of their music is actually a mixture of fast-paced dance-pop and slower, romantic R&B; numbers.\\" Their lyrical content include finance, their own rapping and dancing skills, American recording artists and genres (as mentioned above), American cartoons (e.g. The Hulk) and romantic love. Their lyrics reference and reflect to their hybrid nationality, an example from their song \\"Jump\\" ‚Äì which was an eerily similar clone to Kriss Kross's hit song \\"Jump\\", imitating their beats, rhythms and melodies. LA Boyz' song had a first verse ‚Äì \\"Jerry's gonna make his rap funky in Chinese/ First you gotta start off with the ABCs (American-born Chinese) / Then you gotta learn it like the Taiwanese\\" ‚Äì is followed closely by a reference to the American pop cultural icon Superman. They also tone down the violent themes and difficult-to-understand slang in the lyrics for it to suit a Chinese-speaking audience. They also sought to identify their local Taiwanese audience (despite having audience in Korea, Japan and Mainland China) by speaking with a strong Taiwanese accent and re-releasing some songs in Hokkien. Break Up The band's members all worked in film and production of other Taiwanese artists' albums. Despite their success garnering recognition in Singapore's Billboard Awards Best Performance Group category, Hong Kong Billboard Awards Best New Artist category and at Taiwan's own Golden Melody Awards the group eventually split. Jeff Huang returned to the United States and started an internet company that later merged with a Japanese software company in a 60 million dollar deal before once again returning to Taiwan and fronting hip-hop group Machi; brother Stanley went on to establish a successful solo career, winning Best Mandarin Male Singer in the 2005 Golden Melody Awards; and Lin currently works as an orthopedic surgeon in California while still participating in music and film.

The village is located in the district of J√¶ren and it is the second largest village in H√• municipality after N√¶rb√∏. It was also the administrative centre for the former municipality of Varhaug from 1894 until its dissolution in 1964. The village was founded in the late 19th century and expanded during the 20th century around the local railway station: Varhaug Station. Varhaug lies approximately from the North Sea coastline. The village of Varhaug lies between the two neighbouring villages of N√¶rb√∏ and Vigrestad, and the people live in a \\"love-hate relationship\\" with these villages. There are no one that are more important to beat in a football match. The official demonym for a person coming from the village is Varhaugsbu. An unofficial but friendly nickname for people from Varhaug is Trausk (pl: Trausker). Trausk is a word from J√¶ren, meaning Frog or Toad. The nickname is decades old, and all local villages had one, though Varhaug's nickname is one of the few still somewhat in use. Other words describing a person from Varhaug can be H√•bu or J√¶rbu. With an elevation between , Varhaug is the highest elevated village in the municipality. The future development of Varhaug is uncertain. Agricultural land protection is a hot topic in the local newspapers since the farm land is so important to the nations food supply. The future policy of the Norwegian Government will decide how much the villages of J√¶ren are allowed to expand in the future. Maybe high-rise buildings are the answer, maybe Norway decides to rely more on foreign food production or perhaps there will be new villages established east of the prime agricultural land. History Before Varhaug Station was opened in 1878 as a part of the J√¶ren Line, there was basically only farms in the area. When the train station was built, a lot of services were located near the station, and people started settling down around the station. Origin of the name The name of the village is derived from a farm with the same name, located closer to the sea. It is uncertain why this name was chosen for the train station, but the farms close to the sea have traditionally been wealthy and important in J√¶ren. Varhaug is a word with two elements, the latter \\"haug\\" is from the Old Norse word Haugr and refers in this case to a tumulus. The first \\"Var\\" is believed to be Old Norse meaning \\"stone made\\". Varhaug became the approved name for the village in 1958 by the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority, though it had been in use long before this. Population development The village has a population (2019) of 3,239 and a population density of . The population has been more or less steadily growing ever since Varhaug Station was opened in 1878. Statistics Norway publish population numbers for every large village but only provides detailed information at the municipality level. H√• municipality has always ranked high on fertility rate compared to the Norwegian average. There is no demographic or geographic factors that indicates that the numbers for the municipality is not representative for the village. In 2008, about two-thirds of the population increase in H√• municipality was from new settlers, the rest was from population growth within. Due to the heavy population increase in N√¶rb√∏, it's believed that this number is a bit lower in Varhaug. Still there has been a significant number of asylum seekers, foreign workers and Norwegians from other municipalities settling down in the village. Climate The village is located middle of J√¶ren, which is one of the mildest areas in Norway. This and the flat landscape makes it very suitable for agriculture, compared to other parts of Norway. The flat landscape however makes it pretty windy sometimes. There are normally only a few weeks every year when there is snow. Precipitation is typically about per year and the average temperature is . Temperatures have tended to be higher in more recent years. Economy Traditionally, agriculture has been the backbone of the villages economy. But as the village has grown, it gradually becomes less important. Agriculture is still important for all the farms around the village, and the farmers are still being important customers for the shops in the village. The J√¶ren region has traditionally been and still is well known for the good and hard working craftsmen. The biggest employer in H√• municipality is the municipality itself. Most of these workplaces are spread around in the municipality, but the administration is located in this village, meaning it is one of the most important workplaces in Varhaug. Another big employer in Varhaug is Fjordkj√∏kken AS, a company specializing in producing prefabricated dinner meals for the Norwegian brand Fjordland. Many people from the village has jobs in the larger nearby cities of Stavanger, Sandnes, and Bryne. However, H√• municipality is trying to create more jobs locally, such as the food industry park in Kviamarka. Transportation The S√∏rlandet Line, traditionally the J√¶ren Line, runs through the village, with the J√¶ren Commuter Rail serving Varhaug Station. Because of the hourly train service, there are not other scheduled bus services than school buses. County Road 44 is the main road along the coast between Stavanger and Egersund. County Road 504 connects Varhaug and County Road 44 to the European route E39 highway. Education Varhaug has one elementary school, Varhaug School, and one lower secondary school, Varhaug Lower Secondary School. There are no upper secondary schools in Varhaug. Varhaug skule was opened in 1958 and combined the school houses of Auestad, Lerbrekk, Odland, Ualand and √Önestad. Varhaug ungdomsskule was constructed in the mid-1980s. Before this the youth had traveled to Vigrestad to go to lower secondary school. Sports Most competitive sports are arranged through Varhaug Idrettslag. Media Varhaugbuen is a local printed magazine coming out four times a year. The magazine have articles about local history, upcoming or recent happenings or about people from the village. Varhaugbuen is distributed freely to all households in Varhaug, but is also available for free online at varhaugbuen.no.

Located within the metropolitan county of the West Midlands since 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, it was previously a part of the county of Staffordshire. It is also a ward within the formal district of Perry Barr as well as other areas such as Great Barr, Sandwell and Hamstead/Hamstead Village.

It is an area that has maintained its middle-class status to the present. The area had its own Railway station until 1941 known as Handsworth Wood railway station. The station site lies in a cutting through Handsworth Park, adjacent to St. Mary's Church. Birmingham historian Dr. Carl Chinn noted that during World War II the boundary between Handsworth and Handsworth Wood marked the line between being safe and unsafe from bombing, with Handsworth Wood being an official evacuation zone due to its very country like, undeveloped landscape. Due to the affluent residents of the area properties are larger than usual sizes meaning Handsworth Wood was ideal for evacuees etc.Carl Chinn (1996) Brum Undaunted: Birmingham During the Blitz, Birmingham Library Services Mr Hudson, the singer/songwriter, was born in Handsworth Wood.

She is a classically trained musician and a professional singer/songwriter. She was born in Stirling in 1944, and raised on a croft in Argyll from the age of five.  Early life  Gillies' musical upbringing was wide-ranging. Her maternal grandparents were professional classical violinists, and Gillies learned piano from an early age. While a pupil at Oban High School she was inspired by many of her teachers, especially her English teacher, the poet Iain Crichton Smith, and John Maclean, the Rector (Headmaster) of the school, a native of the Island of Raasay, classical scholar and brother of poet Sorley Maclean, from whom she learned a large number of Gaelic songs and to whom she dedicated her seminal book Songs of Gaelic Scotland (Birlinn, Edinburgh, 2005). In her teens, Gillies sang, danced and played at c√®ilidhs, concerts and M√≤ds, and even introduced a touch of Gaelic culture to BBC Radio Scotland's Children's Hour. She also took advantage of the wide variety of amateur musical and theatrical productions which Oban offered, from school-based folk- group, baroque ensemble, debating society and drama productions to local bands, Gilbert and Sullivan productions and public speaking. In 1962, three months after leaving Oban High School, she won the coveted Women's Gold Medal for singing at the Royal National M√≤d an honour which brought with it a raft of opportunities to perform in concerts, tours, folk-clubs and festivals on both sides of the Border. Highlights from this early period of Gillies' career include singing at large-scale Gaelic concerts on the official programme of the Edinburgh International Festival (Usher Hall, Leith Town Hall); appearing in the first of many live Hogmanay shows (1964) to an audience of over 20 million people; taking part in an iconic televised folk concert in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, organised by poet/folklorist Hamish Henderson, singing alongside legendary Scots and Irish traditional performers such as Jeannie Robertson and The Chieftains. Following this appearance Gillies struck up an unlikely but fruitful musical partnership with Jimmy MacBeath, an itinerant worker and singer of Bothy Ballads from the north east of Scotland. During these early years Gillies also gave regular radio recitals of a capella Gaelic song on BBC Scotland, and sang on the early BBC Gaelic black-and-white television series Songs all the Way. In 1965 Gillies graduated MA (Celtic and English) from the University of Edinburgh, and went on to complete a post-graduate year as research student/transcriber in the School of Scottish Studies, at a time when the collection of Scotland's precious heritage of Gaelic song was at its peak. Then, in 1966, she left Scotland to pursue classical vocal training in Italy and London. She spent the next five years completing her apprenticeship both as a singer, under the tutelage of German Lieder experts Helene Isepp, Ilse Wolf and Paul Hamburger, and also (to \\"have something to fall back on\\") as a secondary school teacher of English, History and Music. Having acquired a Postgraduate Certificate in Education from the University of London (PGCE), she went on to teach in a huge, progressive, arts-orientated comprehensive school in Bicester, Oxfordshire, famed for the size and quality of its Music Department: its impressive end-of-term productions involved the whole community and included Wagner's Die Meistersinger and Verdi's Nabucco (with Gillies in the r√¥le of Abigail). It was with very mixed feelings that she resigned her post to concentrate on her professional career. Television performer Gillies returned to Scotland in 1971, and has been based there ever since, though her career has taken her to many corners of the world, singing in: * Concerts, lecture-recitals, festivals, etc. (Britain, Europe, the US and Canada); corporate entertainment (cabaret and speaking engagements) * Theatre ‚Äì Royal variety performances, pantomimes, musical theatre, one-woman plays, children's shows * Studio recordings ‚Äì ten solo albums to date (Gaelic, Scots and English) and numerous collaborations and compilations * Radio and, especially, television Her media ‚Äúbreak‚Äù came as resident singer on \\"Mainly Magnus\\" (1971‚Äì72) ‚Äì a 26-week live Saturday night TV chat-show (BBC Scotland) hosted by Magnus Magnusson. Other BBC Scotland TV programmes followed, including the much-loved Gaelic musical series 'S e ur beatha BBC Scotland, on which Gillies sang and introduced traditional performers including Aly Bain, Tom Anderson and Na h-√íganaich. In 1973, shortly after the birth of her first child, she starred in a one-off eponymous 50-minute \\"special\\" programme (BBC2 UK network) with guest star Stefan Grapelli. Showcasing Gillies' wide musical repertoire and also featuring her talent as a storyteller and illustrator, this show gained her the rather ironic title of \\"Best TV Newcomer of the Year\\", as voted for by readers of the Daily Record for TRICS, the Television and Radio Industries Club of Scotland. (Even more ironically she was invited back the following year to present the same award to Billy Connolly.) The following, though not exhaustive, summary gives an indication of the scope and variety of Anne's television career during this \\"high noon\\" of her television career, and why Terry Wogan ‚Äì in Birmingham during his \\"Come Dancing\\" days ‚Äì greeted her with the words:‚ÄúI know who you are. You‚Äôre the girl that does more television than all the rest of us put together.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Anne Lorne Gillies: another 50-minute ‚Äúone-off music special‚Äù (network/UK: BBC2, for legendary producer Yvonne Littlewood) was followed by a series of six programmes with the same format in which Gillies presented and sang with a stunning array of international guests including the Swingle Singers, The Kings Singers, the Chieftains, Fairport Convention, Scottish Ballet, Juan Martine, Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen. ‚Ä¢ There was a Girl: a series created for BBC Scotland by the Laurence Olivier Award-winning English dancer Gillian Lynne (choreographer of Cats, Phantom of the Opera, etc. who was created a Dame in 2014). In each programme Anne told a separate love story through music and dance with the help of a troupe of male Broadway dancers, and each featured a male star of film and stage: George Chakiris (American Academy Award-winning actor/dancer, best known for creating the r√¥le of Bernardo Nu√±ez, leader of the Sharks, in the Hollywood smash-hit musical West Side Story), David Hemmings (star of Michaelangelo's Antonioni's enigmatic English film Blow-up), French actor / dancer Jean-Pierre Cassel (Murder on the Orient Express, Oh!

Anne sang Scots songs, mainly from the North-East tradition, and introduced some of Scotland's most enduring entertainers, including Andy Stewart, Isla St Clair, Fulton MacKay, Russell Hunter and Iain Cuthbertson ‚Ä¢ Many one-off TV shows, including Rhythm on Two (contrasting the styles of Gillies and Barbara Dickson, BBC2 UK); Anna agus Clannad (BBC Scotland) ‚Äì highlighting stylistic similarities and distinctions between the Scots and Irish Gaelic traditions; The Puffer‚Äôs Progress: an hour-long film (BBC1 network/UK) shot on location on board a Clyde ‚Äòpuffer‚Äô as she steamed slowly along the Crinan Canal, and showcasing Gillies' own original songs ‚Äì including her ‚Äúsignature song‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Hills of Lorne‚Äù; My kind of music (BBC1 network/UK) also showcasing Gillies' own songs, including ‚ÄúAfter the Pantomime‚Äù: with special guest star, Alan Price. ‚Ä¢ Numerous guest appearances on popular BBC TV series such as Castles in the Air, Songs of Scotland, The Max Boyce Show and Talla a‚Äô Bhaile; on, Independent channels, Thingummyjig, Sir Harry Secombe‚Äôs Highway; and of course the live Hogmanay shows (BBC and ITV network/UK) in which Gillies starred regularly, over the years, alongside Scottish stars such as Kenneth MacKellar, Iain Cuthbertson, Alastair MacDonald, Peter Morrison and Annie Ross. ‚Ä¢ Children's programmes: Gillies' brief but enjoyable stint as Scottish anchorperson on the Multi-coloured Swap Shop (presented by Noel Edmonds and Keith Chegwyn) was interrupted by the birth of her third child. Thereafter she was involved in several Gaelic children's series, including Bzzz which featured twelve original Gaelic pop-songs co-written by Anne and pianist David Pringle. From the late 1980s onwards Gillies increasingly worked as presenter / interviewer of adult programmes, especially those in, or relating to, the Gaelic language: she fronted three series of About Gaelic (Scottish Television's popular and informative chat-show ‚Äì an \\"introduction to Gaelic culture for non-Gaelic speakers\\") and Barail nam Boireannach ‚Äì two challenging hour-long Gaelic language versions of Scottish Television's current affairs series 100 Scottish Women. She was also a guest presenter on BBC's Saturday Night at the Mill (where she interviewed, among others, Tippi Hedren, star of Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds) and, in the 1990s, completed a terrifying 5-day stint chairing Channel Four's live daytime current affairs programme Powerhouse. More recently, with the growth of Gaelic-medium television programming, her innumerable appearances have included * interviewee in chat- shows like C√≤mhradh ri Fionnlagh and Domhnall MacLe√≤id agus D√≤mhnall MacLe√≤id (STV / Grampian); * Thuige seo and Fonn mo bheatha with Cathy Anne MacPhee (BBC Alba) * presenter of religious series: Laoidhean agus Sailm and Spiorad Dh√® (STV / Grampian) * actor in Leabhar an √Äigh ‚Äì dramatised documentary about the man who wrote the definitive Gaelicdictionary, Edward Dwelly (BBC Alba) * writer / presenter of D√† ch√†nan aon chridhe / Twa heids ane hert 45-minute TV musical documentary about Robert Burns (MNE for BBC2) with guest musicians including Sheena Wellington, Jim Malcolm, Karen Matheson, Donald Shaw, James Graham, Maggie MacInnes * writer / producer of Para Shandaidh, S√†r Mharaiche (Br√¨gh for BBC2) a Gaelic drama-documentary which earned Gillies' favourite of all her many reviews over the years: \\"There is a clear temptation to say that ‚ÄúPara Handy, Master Mariner was ‚Äòchust sublime‚Äô, but since it contained only a passing reference to the incident involving a flying tortoise in Glasgow's Carrick Street, the accolade is withheld... An affectionate, thoroughly enjoyable film.\\" (Ian Bell, Scotsman)  Champion of Gaelic  Throughout her career Gillies has espoused many causes, charitable, cultural and political: she has given her services freely to raise funds and public awareness for many organisations ‚Äì medical, social, artistic, political ‚Äì especially those connected to children and Scottish Gaelic culture. In 1983 she was invited to take on the role of Patron of Comhairle nan Sgoiltean √Äraich (the Gaelic Voluntary Playgroup Association) and then became a key player in a no-holds barred nationwide campaign to persuade the authorities to recognise the importance of the Gaelic language both within Scotland and at international level: the urgent need to reverse the decline of Gaelic as a spoken language and to protect and develop its rich heritage through its development as a medium of communication on radio and television and, especially, in mainstream education. In between raising her own three children she worked tirelessly in support of Gaelic voluntary organisations, raising funds and public awareness, organising events, committees and parental groups, and using her contacts and expertise to persuade all political parties, as well as the educational establishment, to acknowledge the viability and value of Gaelic in the modern world ‚Äì specifically as a medium of education at every level of education, both formal and in the community. In 1983 she was commissioned by Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig (the Gaelic College in Skye) to conduct a large-scale study into ‚Äúpopular attitudes towards Gaelic and its relevance to 20th century Scotland‚Äù. Her report led directly to her return to University: first as a full-time post-graduate student in the University of Strathclyde, where she.gained an Additional Qualification as a primary teacher which enabled her fully to support the newly established Gaelic-medium units on both a voluntary and a professional basis. She also attended the University of Glasgow for a part- time Masters‚Äô course in Multicultural Education, which was commuted after one year to a part-time PhD.: Fraser, Anne (1989) ‚ÄúGaelic in primary education: a study of the development of Gaelic bilingual education in urban contexts‚Äù. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow.Fraser, Anne (1989) ‚ÄúGaelic in primary education: a study of the development of Gaelic bilingual education in urban contexts‚Äù. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow She completed this in record time while simultaneously holding down the post of National Education Development Officer with Comann na G√†idhlig (CnaG), the principal Government-funded language development agency at the time. Gillies' remit with CnaG was the promotion of Gaelic as a medium of education at all levels, from preschool to tertiary; to inform parents, educators, the media, government officials and politicians of all parties of the historical importance of Gaelic to Scotland and the world, and to facilitate its usage in the modern context and continuance for future generations. The work of Anne and her colleagues throughout the Gaelic-speaking community led to a sea-change in the fortunes of the language, with unprecedented levels of official support, its burgeoning usage within the Scottish education system and media, and ‚Äì vitally ‚Äì its endorsement and encouragement among native Gaelic-speakers and learners at grassroots level. Massively heartening developments which could not have been predicted when Gillies' own children were growing up. In 1991 Gillies was appointed by Govan Initiative Ltd to develop an arts strategy for the enrichment of a disparate and often dispirited area that had suffered from acute social and economic problems since the decline of the shipbuilding industry. She devised a wide array of arts activities designed to address problems of unemployment, homelessness, addiction, disability, and fear of crime. Among these was the Greater Govan Youth Theatre, a network of groups designed to develop skills and overcome social, sectarian and territorial dichotomies. Conscious of the historical presence of a substantial Gaelic- speaking population in Govan, Gillies devised and produced Tuathche√≤l ‚Äì a televised Gaelic country music series from Glasgow's Grand Old Opry on Govan Road that became popular with audiences throughout Scotland and Ireland. In 1996 she was appointed Gaelic Lecturer in the Faculty of Education of the University of Strathclyde. Gillies has served voluntarily on numerous committees and working-parties, including the Scottish Arts Council Music Committee, The Gaelic Books Council and the Curriculum for Excellence Consultative Group on Gaelic.  Political activism  In 1990s she became publicly and actively involved in the Scottish National Party (SNP), an organisation with which her family had had ties, both direct and indirect, for many decades (see William Gillies). In 1996 she was elected to the SNP's National Council and National Executive Committee, appointed Cabinet Spokesperson on the Arts, Culture and Gaelic, and then stood as SNP candidate for the Western Isles constituency at the 1997 general election and put her public profile to use throughout Scotland in promoting Devolution. In September 1998 she was selected as a candidate for the 1999 European Parliament elections following year by delegates at the SNP's conference.  Writer  Her extensive published works include autobiography Song of Myself (Mainstream, 1992), short stories written under her married name Anne Bree (Polygon, 2000, 2001); Gaelic children's fiction and poetry under her Gaelic name Anna Latharna NicGill√¨osa (Acair, Br√¨gh, St√≤rlann) and her seminal collection Songs of Gaelic Scotland (Birlinn) now in its 3rd edition. Published in 2005, Songs of Gaelic Scotland won the prestigious academic Ratcliff Prize for \\"an important contribution by an individual to the study of Folk and Folklore in Great Britain and Ireland\\". She has also worked as writer / producer of Gaelic programmes at Scottish television, notably on Speaking our Language ‚Äì Scottish Television's flagship multimedia adult learning series ‚Äì and Caraidean, Channel Four's preschool Gaelic learning Series. She also co- wrote Reoiteag air Rothan / The Ice-cream Factory for Channel 5. Honours and awards Gillies was elected by the membership of the Association of Speakers‚Äô Clubs of Great Britain as their Speaker of the Year, 2005. Other awards and honours have included an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Edinburgh; Fellowships from the University of the Highlands and Islands, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and the Association for Scottish Literary Studies; and her appointment in 2009 as Tosgair na G√†idhlig (Gaelic Ambassador) by the Scottish Government. Her voluntary and charitable work has been recognised by the award of Rotary International's Paul Harris Fellowship. Anne was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame in 2012.  2000 onwards  She left Strathclyde University in 2000, to work freelance again, specifically to address the urgent need for resources (print, electronic etc.) in Gaelic-medium classrooms. She moved to Ayrshire and, along with her husband, Kevin Bree, set up an independent Gaelic multimedia partnership (Br√¨gh) producing Gaelic books and talking books, television and radio programmes, music CDs, CD-ROMs (educational games and teachers‚Äô packs etc.) She continues to sing, teach and lead master-classes and workshops on Gaelic music on both sides of the Atlantic and appears fairly frequently as a singer / interviewee on BBC Alba and BBC Radio nan G√†idheal. She is currently writing a historical novel set in 17th century Scotland, Ireland and France. Family Anne Lorne Gillies is married to Kevin Bree. She has three children by her previous marriage to Neil Fraser: Robbie, Marsaili and Rachel. Between them Anne and Kevin have 13 (step)grandchildren. Anne's brother is Prof. William Gillies.

It was originally opened in 1978 by recording engineer Brian Masterson in premises at 22 Windmill Lane, and it subsequently relocated to its current location in a three-storey building at 20 Ringsend Road, Dublin 4, where it still operates as one of Ireland's largest recording studios. Over the course of its history, it has been used by many notable artists. The original site of the Windmill Lane Studios remained a popular cult symbol for music fans due to the studio's links with the Irish rock group U2; the group's albums to have been fully or partially recorded there include Boy, October, War, The Joshua Tree, Pop, All That You Can't Leave Behind, and Zooropa. History of old location Windmill Lane Recording Studios was originally opened by recording engineer Brian Masterson in 1978, and was first located in the Dublin Docklands on Windmill Lane, just off Sir John Rogerson's Quay. It was originally used to record traditional Irish music, notably by Planxty. However, no Irish rock band recorded in the studios until U2. The drums on Boy were recorded in the reception area of the recording studios, due to producer Steve Lillywhite's desire to achieve \\"this wonderful clattery sound\\". They had to wait until the receptionist went home in the evenings as the phone rang through the day and even occasionally in the evening. After U2 based themselves at the studios, Van Morrison, Sin√©ad O'Connor, and Elvis Costello recorded there. Clannad's hit \\"Theme from Harry's Game\\" was also recorded at the studios, and two albums by Status Quo were recorded there in 1980: Just Supposin' and Never Too Late, released in 1981. The studios were expanded in the 1980s under the supervision of Andy Munro of Munro Acoustics. Much of the work was done specifically for U2's album The Joshua Tree. In 1990 the main studio moved to a new location on Ringsend Road, also in the Docklands. One\\". Following the move, the Windmill Lane building continued to house various post-production facilities. These included Windmill Lane Pictures (a video post-production facility), incorporating Number 4 (an audio post-production facility), Trend Studios (audio mastering) and a number of other related services. The original studio buildings were covered in graffiti from fans, who had paid pilgrimage from all over the world, many attracted by the studio's historical connection with U2. Another copy of this article is located here. The original location of the studios were recommended as a tourist attraction by publications such as The New York Times in 2008. Windmill Lane Studios was known for its graffiti, here seen in 2008. The post-production studios at Windmill Lane became the first building in Ireland to buy a Baselight colour grading system on 2 April 2008. The studios have been used for several films, including In America and Get Rich and Die Tryin' directed by Jim Sheridan, and has been used for American films made in Ireland, examples of which include King Arthur and Veronica Guerin. Plans to construct a six-storey office block on the old site led to criticism from local resident groups in early September 2008. The Windmill Lane site was then bought by property companies Hibernia REIT in 2015, who announced in 2014 that it had purchased the loans held against the Hanover Building on Windmill Lane, Dublin, for ‚Ç¨20.16 million and an adjoining one acre development site for ‚Ç¨7.5 million. A plan was made to develop it into offices, retail spaces and residential units. The original Windmill Lane Studios structure was demolished on 3 April 2015, by property investment company Hibernia REIT, with the exception of Open Gallery 3 where U2 recorded. The firm announced plans to retain a 20-metre stretch of the studio wall famous for its fan graffiti. Options for the future of the wall include recreating the wall in the atrium of the new Windmill Lane building, giving the wall to Dublin City Council, U2 or any other interested party for reconstruction or reuse in an alternative setting. Another possibility is donating the wall to a charity so that they can auction pieces of it to U2 fans around the world. History of current location Studio One Control Room In 1990, Windmill Lane Studios relocated from its original site on Windmill Lane to its current location on Ringsend Road, Dublin 4. Orchestras regularly record their music at Windmill Lane Recording Studios, as Studio One is the only recording room in Ireland that can record an 80-piece orchestra apart from Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann. The scores to many movies have been recorded there: Mission Impossible, Syng Street, A Room with a View, The Remains of the Day, The Mask and The Tailor of Panama, The Grifters, My Left Foot (both by Elmer Bernstein), In America, and A River Runs Through It. Studio Two is known for being responsible for a high number of number-one albums, recorded by artists such as Gabrielle, Kylie Minogue and The Spice Girls. Kate Bush partially recorded her 1985 album Hounds of Love at Windmill Lane Studios. The Waterboys recorded their 1988 album Fisherman's Blues at Windmill Lane Studios. The studio remained empty from 2006 onwards, although reports circulated which linked Van Morrison with purchasing the studio for his own personal use that August. Morrison had previously recorded several albums there, including Back on Top, Magic Time and Pay the Devil. In January 2008, the studio was used to record \\"The Ballad of Ronnie Drew\\". In 2009, Dale Entertainments Ltd. took over Windmill Lane Recording Studios and updated the studios. Music of all types and genres continue to be recorded here, from pop and electronic to jazz and classical film scores. A multitude of Grammy Award winning albums hang on the walls of the studios inside. Artists and projects recorded here include : AC/DC, U2, David Bowie, Kate Bush, Riverdance, The Rolling Stones, The Cranberries, Metallica, Depeche Mode, The Commitments, Westlife, The Spice Girls, Lady Gaga, The Jonas Brothers, Van Morrison, Kylie Minogue, The Script, Ed Sheeran, Hozier and many more. In mid-February 2012, the studio issued an appeal to artists who recorded there to collect their master tapes, stating they will be otherwise be destroyed. The studio noted the tapes, numbering over 1,000 and weighing a tonne, were recorded before digital technology and were both deteriorating and are taking up valuable space. Subsequently, all tapes owned by Island Records were recovered by them. On 20 February 2020, the studio launched a visitor experience. President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins was the guest of honour along with key music industry personalities. Guests were treated to a surprise musical performance by Paul Brady and Donal Lunny in the iconic Studio 1.

It is in the civil parish of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford and is categorised by the Office of National Statistics as part of Bletchley. It is in the civil parish of West Bletchley. The A5 forms its eastern and northern boundary; parts of Bletcham Way and Saxon St form its southern boundary. The overall district has five sub districts, divided by Watling St/Denbigh Rd, the 'uptick' of Bletcham Way and Grafton Street, and Saxon Street northbound. The district names are planning designations that have persisted without ever being changed to the style \\"North Denbigh\\" etc. as is the norm elsewhere in Britain.

The football stadium opened in July 2007 and was ready for the start of the 2007/08 season. An indoor basketball arena for the then Milton Keynes Lions basketball team was planned as part of the stadium complex but as of mid-2014 has yet to materialise. The major retailers are an Asda supercentre and IKEA superstore, with smaller shops in the MK1 Shopping Park. The superstores were open for business by the end of 2005. The first units of the MK1 Shopping Park, constructed later of the Asda and IKEA development, include a McDonald's and KFC on the Saxon Street side of the stadium, with a DW Sports Fitness centre on the Grafton Street side of the stadium. The main retail centre of the MK1 Shopping Park opened in December 2012, which comprises Marks and Spencer, Outfit (previously BHS), H&M;, New Look, Next, Primark and River Island which opened sites in the shopping park. The latter was developed adjacent to Stadium MK by InterMK and The Crown Estate.Milton Keynes ¬£25m complex to be funded by Crown Estate InterMK is owned by Pete Winkelman, chairman of the MK Dons. The development also includes a newer leisure facility and cinema complex directly behind the stadium, comprising an Odeon IMAX Cinema, Nandos, Bella Italia, TGI Fridays, Prezzo and Frankie and Benny's which opened in late February/early March 2015. The MK1 Shopping Park expanded once again, constructing a new five-unit development in the space between the original shopping park and the newer cinema complex. This comprises, at its opening, a JD Sports, Carphone Warehouse and Card Factory. This opened in early December 2017. The hotel is a DoubleTree by Hilton Worldwide, part of the stadium complex. The development is on the former site of 'Denbigh Sports Ground' and 'Denbigh North Leisure', an entertainment complex which was home to the Sanctuary Music Arena.

Denbigh East Denbigh East is another employment area, east of Saxon Street and west of the Grand Union canal. Mount Farm This district is an industrial/employment area. The Milton Keynes central sorting office was here, with the post-code MK1 1AA. Many internet mapping sites assumed that this meant that it is the centre of Milton Keynes and mark it according. It is actually about three miles south of Central Milton Keynes (which has the MK9 postcode). Granby This is a small area, just north of the stadium. It is mainly industrial, but includes a mosque and a small, isolated, council housing block (that is planned for regeneration in the expansion plans for Milton Keynes). The district takes its name from the original 'Marquis of Granby\\" inn nearby, as described next. Denbigh Hall Inscription on Denbigh Hall bridge The modern industrial district called Denbigh Hall is in West Bletchley rather than in Denbigh, but is mentioned here because its history gives rise to the name Denbigh. A local heritage map shows that it lies on the site of 'Denbigh Farm' It is separated from Denbigh by Watling Street. The original Denbigh Hall was an inn on Watling Street, dating from 1710.\\"Milton Keynes Heritage\\" (map) - English Partnerships 2004 Family recollections say that it had previously been known as 'the Marquis of Granby' but that it had changed its name in the eighteenth century when the sixth Earl of Denbigh stopped there overnight and was made so comfortable that he declared it his half-way house to London.The North American review (1821) Forty-five miles from London on the Watling Street road, where it is spanned by the bridge carrying the main line of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to the North, is a solitary little inn bearing the name of Denbigh Hall. How different are modern conditions from those prevailing when my old great-great-grandfather, the sixth Earl of Denbigh, who died in 1800, used to rumble slowly and uncomfortably along this road to London in his ponderous coach ! One day a wheel came off in the mud near this inn, then known as the \\"Marquis of Granby \\", and, putting up there for the night, he was made so comfortable that he forthwith appointed it his half-way house to London, and the name was changed to its present one. (Archive.ORG)'The Holyhead Road; the mail-coach road to Dublin' Harper, Charles G 1902 THE STORY OF \\"DENBIGH HALL\\" 171 Another contemporary says : \\" The building called ' Denbigh Hall,' respecting which the reader may have formed the same conception as ourselves, and imagined it to be the august mansion of some illustrious grandee, is nothing but a miserable hostelry of the lowest order, a paltry public-house, or 'Tom and Jerry shop,' as we heard an indignant fellow-traveller contemptuously style it, which has taken the liberty of assuming this magnificent appellation.\\" Tradition described how this house, once called the \\" Marquis of Granby,\\" had been resorted to by the Earl of Denbigh on one occasion when his carriage had broken down, and that he stayed the night under its roof, and was so grateful for the attentions of the host that he left some property to that fortunate man, who thereupon changed the name of his sign to the \\"Denbigh Hall.\\" This, at any rate, was the story told when the London and Birmingham Railway was first opened. There were those who looked upon it as a myth invented for the amusement of travellers, and perhaps those sceptics were right, but let others who are not unwilling to believe the story, hug the apt reflection that so unusual a sign must have had an unusual origin ; and, so much being granted, let them go a little further and accept the legend as it is told. The little inn still stands by the wayside. (Archive.ORG) The inn no longer exists; its site is shown on the 1840 Ordnance Survey as just north of the bridge 158 where the West Coast Main Line crosses Watling Street.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/mapsheet.aspx?compid=55108&sheetid;=928&zm;=1&x;=285&y;=217&ox;=1220&oy;=1735 Ordnance Survey 1:10,560 - Epoch 1 > England - Buckinghamshire > 015] \\"British History Online\\" - BritishHistory.ac.uk A third tale relates that the nobleman was given an axe when he asked for a bill. The same map shows a large private house, 'Denbigh Hall', to the south-east of the innits site is approximately at the junction of Whaddon Way with Melrose Avenue. Network Rail continues to use this name (Denbigh Hall) for its marshalling yards north of Bletchley railway station, near the site of the inn. The West Coast Main Line bridge (number 158) over Watling Street near here bears a plaque that explains that the first phase of the London and Birmingham Railway line terminated here, at Denbigh Hall station. At this point, passengers transferred to stage coaches for onward transfer by road to Birmingham.'A SHORT HISTORY OF THE L & N. -W. RAILWAY AT RUGBY', Rugby Advertiser, 26 December 1908, 9 April 1838 The line from London to Denbigh Hall was opened to the public. -(Denbigh Hall is a little hamlet about two miles north of Bletchley station, and was no doubt selected for a temporary terminus as the Holyhead coach Road crossed the line at this spot.) Immense crowds of people assembled along the newly opened portion of the line to see the first train pass. The line between Birmingham and rugby was opened on the same day. Owing to the delay in finishing Kilsby tunnel and Roade cutting, the line between Rugby and Denbigh Hall is not completed: and the Company have therefore arranged with Messrs Horne and Chaplin, the coach proprietors, to convey passengers by road over the intervening 36 or 37 miles between the two places.

Glass ionomer cement - composite resin spectrum of restorative materials used in dentistry. Towards the GIC end of the spectrum, there is increasing fluoride release and increasing acid-base content; towards the composite resin end of the spectrum, there is increasing light cure percentage and increased flexural strength. Dental composite resins (better referred to as \\"resin-based composites\\" or simply \\"filled resins\\") are dental cements made of synthetic resins. Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, of good tooth-like appearance, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of Bis-GMA and other dimethacrylate monomers (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as silica and in most current applications, a photoinitiator. Dimethylglyoxime is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow-ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent. Many studies have compared the longevity of resin-based composite restorations to the longevity of silver-mercury amalgam restorations. Depending on the skill of the dentist, patient characteristics and the type and location of damage, composite restorations can have similar longevity to amalgam restorations. (See Longevity and clinical performance.) In comparison to amalgam, the appearance of resin-based composite restorations is far superior. History of use Traditionally resin-based composites set by a chemical setting reaction through polymerization between two pastes. One paste containing an activator (not a tertiary amine, as these cause discolouration) and the other containing an initiator (benzoyl peroxide). To overcome the disadvantages of this method, such as a short working time, light-curing resin composites were introduced in the 1970s. The first light-curing units used ultra-violet light to set the material, however this method had a limited curing depth and was a high risk to patients and clinicians. Therefore, UV light-curing units were later replaced by visible light-curing systems which used Camphorquinone as a light source and overcame the issues produced by the UV light-curing units. The Traditional Period In the late 1960s, composite resins were introduced as an alternative to silicates and unfulfilled resins, which were frequently used by clinicians at the time. Composite resins displayed superior qualities, in that they had better mechanical properties than silicates and unfulfilled resins. Composite resins were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with composite resins at this time were that they had poor appearance, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with polishing, difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form. The Microfilled Period In 1978, various microfilled systems were introduced into the European market. These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their tooth tissue-like appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation. It was decided, after further research, that this type of composite could be used for most restorations provided the acid etch technique was used and a bonding agent was applied. The Hybrid Period Hybrid composites were introduced in the 1980s and are more commonly known as resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGICs). The material consists of a powder containing a radio-opaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule. The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for Class II cavities. RMGICs can be used instead. This mixture or resin and glass ionomer allows the material to be set by light activation (resin), allowing a longer working time. It also has the benefit of the glass ionomer component releasing fluoride and has superior adhesive properties. RMGICs are now recommended over traditional GICs for basing cavities. There is a great difference between the early and new hybrid composites. Initially, resin-based composite restorations in dentistry were very prone to leakage and breakage due to weak compressive strength. In the 1990s and 2000s, such composites were greatly improved and have a compression strength sufficient for use in posterior teeth. Chemical structure of bis-GMA (bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate), bearing two polymerizable groups, it is prone to form a crosslinked polymer that is used in dental restorations. Method and clinical application Today's composite resins have low polymerization shrinkage and low coefficients of thermal shrinkage, which allows them to be placed in bulk while maintaining good adaptation to cavity walls. The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely. The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth. Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470 nm), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see Light activated resin). It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2‚Äì3 mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2‚Äì3 mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, of good appearance, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more. The most desirable finish surface for a composite resin can be provided by aluminum oxide disks. Classically, Class III composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized. Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be \\"sandwiched\\" into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s. The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve the appearance and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% phosphoric acid and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an acid etch technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-eugenol. Composite resins for Class II restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations. Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008. Composition Dental composite resin. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based oligomer matrix, such as a bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA), urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) or semi-crystalline polyceram (PEX), and an inorganic filler such as silicon dioxide (silica). Without a filler the resin wears easily, exhibits high shrinkage and is exothermic. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. The filler gives the composite greater strength, wear resistance, decreased polymerisation shrinkage, improved translucency, fluorescence and colour, and a reduced exothermic reaction on polymerisation. It also however causes the resin composite to become more brittle with an increased elastic modulus. Glass fillers are found in multiple different compositions allowing an improvement on the optical and mechanical properties of the material. Ceramic fillers include zirconia-silica and zirconium oxide. Matrices such as BisHPPP and BBP, contained in the universal adhesive BiSGMA, have been demonstrated to increase the cariogenicity of bacteria leading to the occurrence of secondary caries at the composite-dentin interface. BisHPPP and BBP cause an increase of glycosyltransferase in S. mutans bacteria, which results in increased production of sticky glucans that allow S.mutans' adherence to the tooth. This results in a cariogenic biofilms at the interface of composite and tooth. The cariogenic activity of bacteria increases with concentration of the matrix materials. BisHPPP has furthermore been shown to regulate bacterial genes, making bacteria more cariogenic, thus compromising the longevity of composite restorations. Researchers are highlighting the need for new composite materials to be developed which eliminate the cariogenic products currently contained in composite resin and universal adhesives. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between these two components. An initiator package (such as: camphorquinone (CQ), phenylpropanedione (PPD) or lucirin (TPO)) begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when blue light is applied. Various additives can control the rate of reaction.  Filler types and particle size  Resin filler can be made of glasses or ceramics. Glass fillers are usually made of crystalline silica, silicone dioxide, lithium/barium-aluminium glass, and borosilicate glass containing zinc/strontium/lithium. Ceramic fillers are made of zirconia-silica, or zirconium oxide. Fillers can be further subdivided based on their particle size and shapes such as: = Macrofilled filler = Macrofilled fillers have a particle size ranging from 5 - 10 ¬µm. They have good mechanical strength but poor wear resistance. Final restoration is difficult to polish adequately leaving rough surfaces, and therefore this type of resin is plaque retentive. = Microfilled filler = Microfilled fillers are made of colloidal silica with a particle size of 0.4 ¬µm. Resin with this type of filler is easier to polish compared to macrofilled. However, its mechanical properties are compromised as filler load is lower than in conventional (only 40-45% by weight). Therefore, it is contraindicated for load-bearing situations, and has poor wear resistance. = Hybrid filler = Hybrid filler contains particles of various sizes with filler load of 75-85% by weight. It was designed to get the benefits of both macrofilled and microfilled fillers. Resins with hybrid filler have reduced thermal expansion and higher mechanical strength. However, it has higher polymerisation shrinkage due to a larger volume of diluent monomer which controls viscosity of resin. = Nanofilled filler = Nanofilled composite has a filler particle size of 20-70 nm. Nanoparticles form nanocluster units and act as a single unit. They have high mechanical strength similar to hybrid material, high wear resistance, and are easily polished. However, nanofilled resins are difficult to adapt to the cavity margins due to high volume of filler. = Bulk filler = Bulk filler is composed of non-agglomerated silica and zirconia particles. It has nanohybrid particles and filler load of 77% by weight. Designed to decrease clinical steps with possibility of light curing through 4-5mm incremental depth, and reduce stress within remaining tooth tissue. Unfortunately, it is not as strong in compression and has decreased wear resistance compared to conventional material. Advantages Advantages of composites: * Appearance: The main advantage of a direct dental composite over traditional materials such as amalgam is improved tooth tissue-mimicry. Composites can be in a wide range of tooth colors allowing near invisible restoration of teeth. Composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Aesthetics are especially critical in anterior teeth region - see Aesthetic anterior composite restorations. * Bonding to tooth structure: Composite fillings micro-mechanically bond to tooth structure. This strengthens the tooth's structure and restores its original physical integrity. The discovery of acid etching (producing enamel irregularities ranging from 5-30 micrometers in depth) of teeth to allow a micro-mechanical bond to the tooth allows good adhesion of the restoration to the tooth. Very high bond strengths to tooth structure, both enamel and dentin, can be achieved with the current generation of dentin bonding agents. * Tooth-sparing preparation: The fact that composite fillings are glued (bonded) to the tooth means that unlike amalgam fillings, there is no need for the dentist to create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of the hole to retain the filling, composite materials are bonded to the tooth. In order to achieve the necessary geometry to retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to drill out a significant amount of healthy tooth material. In the case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or \\"box\\") is less important because a composite filling bonds to the tooth. Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration. * Less-costly and more conservative alternative to dental crowns: In some situations, a composite restoration may be offered as a less-expensive (though possibly less durable) alternative to a dental crown, which can be a very expensive treatment. Installation of a dental crown usually requires removal of significant healthy tooth material so the crown can fit over or into the natural tooth. Composite restoration conserves more of the natural tooth. *Alternative to tooth removal: As a composite restoration bonds to the tooth and can restore the original physical integrity of a damaged or decayed tooth, in some cases composite restoration can preserve a tooth that might not be salvageable with amalgam restoration. For example, depending on the location and extent of decay, it might not be possible to create a void (a \\"box\\") of the geometry necessary to retain an amalgam filling. * Versatility: Composite fillings can be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth which would not be repairable using amalgam fillings. * Repairability: In many cases of minor damage to a composite filling, the damage can be easily repaired by adding additional composite. An amalgam filling might require complete replacement. *Longer working time: The light-curing composite allows the on- demand setting and longer working time to some degree for the operator compared to amalgam restoration. * Reduced quantity of mercury released to the environment: Composites avoid mercury environmental contamination associated with dentistry. When amalgam fillings are drilled for height adjustment, repair or replacement, some mercury-containing amalgam is inevitably washed down drains. (See Dental amalgam controversy - Environmental impact) When amalgam fillings are prepared by dentists, improperly disposed excess material may enter landfills or be incinerated. Cremation of bodies containing amalgam fillings releases mercury into the environment. (See Dental amalgam controversy - Cremation) * Reduced mercury exposure for dentists: Preparing new amalgam fillings and drilling into existing amalgam fillings exposes dentists to mercury vapor. Use of composite fillings avoids this risk, unless the procedure also involves removing an existing amalgam filling. A review article found studies indicating that dental work involving mercury may be an occupational hazard with respect to reproductive processes, glioblastoma (brain cancer), renal function changes, allergies and immunotoxicological effects. (See Dental amalgam controversy - Health effects for dentists) * Lack of corrosion: Although corrosion is no longer a major problem with amalgam fillings, resin composites do not corrode at all. (Low-copper amalgams, prevalent before 1963, were more subject to corrosion than modern high-copper amalgams. ) Disadvantages *Composite shrinkage and secondary caries: In the past, composite resins suffered significant shrinkage during curing, which led to inferior bonding interface. Shrinkage permits microleakage, which, if not caught early, can cause secondary caries (subsequent decay), the most significant dental disadvantage of composite restoration. In a study of 1,748 restorations, risk of secondary caries in the composite group was 3.5 times risk of secondary caries in the amalgam group. Good dental hygiene and regular checkups can mitigate this disadvantage. Most current microhybrid and nanohybrid composites have a polymerization shrinkage that ranges from 2% to 3.5%. Composite shrinkage can be reduced by altering the molecular and bulk composition of the resin.For example, UltraSeal XT Plus uses Bis-GMA without dimethacrylate and was found to have a shrinkage of 5.63%, 30 minutes after curing. On the other hand, this same study found that Heliomolar, which uses Bis-GMA, UDMA and decandiol dimethacrylate, had a shrinkage of 2.00%, 30 minutes after curing. Retrieved 2009-04-16. In the field of dental restorative materials, reduction of composite shrinkage has been achieved with some success. Among the newest materials, silorane resin exhibits lower polymerization shrinkage, compared to the dimethacrylates. * Durability: In some situations, composite fillings may not last as long as amalgam fillings under the pressure of chewing, particularly if used for large cavities. (See Longevity and clinical performance, below.) * Chipping: Composite materials can chip off the tooth. * Skill and training required: Successful outcomes in direct composite fillings is related to the skills of the practitioner and technique of placement. For example, a rubber dam is rated as being important for achieving longevity and low fracture rates similar to amalgam in the more demanding proximal Class II cavities. * Need to keep working area in mouth completely dry: The prepared tooth must be completely dry (free of saliva and blood) when the resin material is being applied and cured. Posterior teeth (molars) are difficult to keep dry. Keeping the prepared tooth completely dry can also be difficult for any work involving treatment of cavities at or below the gumline, though techniques have been described to facilitate this. * Time and expense: Due to the sometimes complicated application procedures and the need to keep the prepared tooth absolutely dry, composite restorations may take up to 20 minutes longer than equivalent amalgam restorations. Longer time in the dental chair may test the patience of children, making the procedure more difficult for the dentist. Due to the longer time involved, the fee charged by a dentist for a composite restoration may be higher than for an amalgam restoration. *Costs: Composite restoration cases generally have limited insurance coverage. Some dental insurance plans may provide reimbursement for composite restoration only on front teeth where amalgam restorations would be particularly objectionable on cosmetic grounds. Thus, patients may be required to pay the entire charge for composite restorations on posterior teeth. For example one dental insurer states that most of their plans will pay for resin (i.e. composite) fillings only \\"on the teeth where their cosmetic benefit is critical: the six front teeth (incisors and cuspids) and on the facial (cheek side) surfaces of the next two teeth (bicuspids).\\" Even if charges are paid by private insurance or government programs, the higher cost is incorporated in dental insurance premiums or tax rates. In the UK, dental composites are not covered by NHS for the restoration of posterior teeth. Patients, therefore, may require to pay the entire charge of the treatment or have to pay according to the private charge rate. Direct dental composites A hand-held wand that emits primary blue light (Œªmax=450-470nm) is used to cure the resin within a dental patient's mouth.Direct dental composites are placed by the dentist in a clinical setting. Polymerization is accomplished typically with a hand held curing light that emits specific wavelengths keyed to the initiator and catalyst packages involved. When using a curing light, the light should be held as close to the resin surface as possible, a shield should be placed between the light tip and the operator's eyes. Curing time should be increased for darker resin shades. Light cured resins provide denser restoration than self-cured resins because no mixing is required that might introduce air bubble porosity. Direct dental composites can be used for: * Filling cavity preparations * Filling gaps (diastemas) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or * Minor reshaping of teeth * Partial crowns on single teeth  Setting mechanisms of resin composite  Types of setting mechanisms: * Chemical cure (self-cure / dark cure) * Light cure * Dual cure (setting both chemically and by light) Chemically cured resin composite is a two-paste system (base and catalyst) which starts to set when the base and the catalyst are mixed together. Light cured resin composites contains a photo-initiator (e.g. camphorquinone) and an accelerator. The activator present in light activated composite is diethyl-amino-ethyl- methacrylate (amine) or diketone. They interact when exposed to light at wavelength of 400-500 nm, i.e, blue region of the visible light spectrum. The composite sets when it is exposed to light energy at a set wavelength of light. Light cured resin composites are also sensitive to ambient light, and therefore, polymerisation can begin before use of the curing light. Dual cured resin composite contains both photo-initiators and chemical accelerators, allowing the material to set even where there is insufficient light exposure for light curing. Chemical polymerisation inhibitors (e.g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are added to the resin composite to prevent polymerisation of the material during storage, increasing its shelf life.  Classification of resin composites according to handling characteristics  This classification divides resin composite into three broad categories based on their handling characteristics: * Universal: advocated for general use, oldest subtype of resin composite * Flowable: fluid consistency, used for very small restorations * Packable: stiffer, more viscous material used solely for posterior parts of the mouth Manufacturers manipulate the handling characteristics by altering the constituents of the material. Generally, the stiffer materials (packable) exhibit a higher filler content whilst fluid materials (flowable) exhibit lower filler loading. Universal: This is the traditional presentation of resin composites and performs well in many situations. However, their use is limited in specialised practice where more complex aesthetic treatments are undertaken. Indications include: the restoration of class I, II and III and IV where aesthetics is not paramount, and the repair of non-carious tooth surface loss (NCTSL) lesions. Contraindications include: restoration of ultraconservative cavities, in areas where aesthetics is critical, and where insufficient enamel is available for etching. The use of flowable composite in early decay of lower molar teeth. Flowable: Flowable composites represent a relatively newer subset of resin- based composite material, dating back to the mid-1990s. Compared to universal composite, flowables have a reduced filler content (37‚Äì53%) thereby exhibiting ease of handling, lower viscosity, compressive strength, wear resistance and greater polymerisation shrinkage. Due to the poorer mechanical properties, flowable composites should be used with caution in high stress-bearing areas. However, due to its favourable wetting properties, it can adapt intimately to enamel and dentine surfaces. Indications include: restoration of small class I cavities, preventive resin restorations (PRR), fissure sealants, cavity liners, repair of deficient amalgam margins, and class V (abfraction) lesions caused by NCTSL. Contraindications include: in high stress-bearing areas, restoration of large multi-surface cavities, and if effective moisture control is unattainable. Packable: Packable composites were developed to be used in posterior situations. Unlike flowable composite, they exhibit a higher viscosity thereby necessitating greater force upon application to 'pack' the material into the prepared cavity. Their handling characteristics is more similar to dental amalgam, in that greater force is required to condense the material into the cavity. Therefore, they can be thought of as 'tooth-coloured amalgam'. The increased viscosity is achieved by a higher filler content (>60% by volume) ‚Äì thereby making the material stiffer and more resistant to fracture, two properties that are ideal for materials to be used in the posterior region of the mouth. The disadvantage of the associated increased filler content is the potential risk of introducing voids along the cavity walls and between each layer of material. In order to seal any marginal deficiencies, the use of a single layer of flowable composite at the base of a cavity has been advocated when undertaking Class II posterior composite restorations when using packable composite. Indirect dental composites Indirect composite is cured outside the mouth, in a processing unit that is capable of delivering higher intensities and levels of energy than handheld lights can. Indirect composites can have higher filler levels, are cured for longer times and curing shrinkage can be handled in a better way. As a result, they are less prone to shrinkage stress and marginal gaps Conclusion:..\\" Considering the more invasive cavity preparation and the higher cost of restorations made by the inlay technique, this study indicates that resin fillings in most cases should be preferred over resin inlays.\\" and have higher levels and depths of cure than direct composites. For example, an entire crown can be cured in a single process cycle in an extra-oral curing unit, compared to a millimeter layer of a filling. As a result, full crowns and even bridges (replacing multiple teeth) can be fabricated with these systems. Indirect dental composites can be used for: * Filling cavities in teeth, as fillings, inlays and/or onlays * Filling gaps (diastemas) between teeth using a shell- like veneer or * Reshaping of teeth * Full or partial crowns on single teeth * Bridges spanning 2-3 teeth A stronger, tougher and more durable product is expected in principle. But in the case of inlays, not all clinical long-term- studies detect this advantage in clinical practice (see below). Longevity and clinical performance=Direct composite vs amalgam Clinical survival of composite restorations placed in posterior teeth are in the range of amalgam restorations, with some studies seeing a slightly lower or slightly higher survival time compared to amalgam restorations. Improvements in composite technology and application technique make composites a very good alternative to amalgam, while use in large restorations and in cusp capping situations is still debated. According to a 2012 review article by Demarco et al. covering 34 relevant clinical studies, \\"90% of the studies indicated that annual failure rates between 1% and 3% can be achieved with Class I and II posterior [rear tooth] composite restorations depending on the definition of failure, and on several factors such as tooth type and location, operator [dentist], and socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral elements.\\" This compares to a 3% mean annual failure rate reported in a 2004 review article by Manhart et al. for amalgam restorations in posterior stress-bearing cavities. The Demarco review found that the main reasons cited for failure of posterior composite restorations are secondary caries (i.e. cavities which develop subsequent to the restoration), fracture, and patient behavior, notably bruxism (grinding/clenching.) Causes of failure for amalgam restorations reported in the Manhart et al.review also include secondary caries, fracture (of the amalgam and/or the tooth), as well as cervical overhang and marginal ditching. The Demarco et al. review of composite restoration studies noted that patient factors affect longevity of restorations: Compared to patients with generally good dental health, patients with poorer dental health (possibly due to poor dental hygiene, diet, genetics, frequency of dental checkups, etc.) experience higher rates of failure of composite restorations due to subsequent decay. Socioeconomic factors also play a role: \\"People who had always lived in the poorest stratus [sic][stratum?] of the population had more restoration failures than those who lived in the richest layer.\\" The definition of failure applied in clinical studies may affect the reported statistics. Demarco et al note: \\"Failed restorations or restorations presenting small defects are routinely treated by replacement by most clinicians. Because of this, for many years, the replacement of defective restorations has been reported as the most common treatment in general dental practice...\\" Demarco et al observe that when both repaired and replaced restorations were classified as failures in one study, the Annual Failure Rate was 1.9%. However, when repaired restorations were reclassified as successes instead of failures, the AFR decreased to 0.7%. Reclassifying repairable minor defects as successes rather than failures is justifiable: \\"When a restoration is replaced, a significant amount of sound tooth structure is removed and the preparation [i.e. hole] is enlarged\\". Applying the narrower definition of failure would improve the reported longevity of composite restorations: Composite restorations can often be easily repaired or extended without drilling out and replacing the entire filling. Resin composites will adhere to the tooth and to undamaged prior composite material. In contrast, amalgam fillings are held in place by the shape of the void being filled rather than by adhesion. This means that it is often necessary to drill out and replace an entire amalgam restoration rather than add to the remaining amalgam. Direct vs indirect composites It might be expected that the costlier indirect technique leads to a higher clinical performance, however this is not seen in all studies. A study conducted over the course of 11 years reports similar failure rates of direct composite fillings and indirect composite inlays. Another study concludes that although there is a lower failure rate of composite inlays it would be insignificant and anyway too small to justify the additional effort of the indirect technique. Also in the case of ceramic inlays a significantly higher survival rate compared to composite direct fillings can not be detected. In general, a clear superiority of tooth coloured inlays over composite direct fillings could not be established by current review literature (as of 2013). Conclusions: \\"Ceramic materials perform as well as alternative restorative materials for use as inlay restorations. However, a lack of long-term data means that this conclusion can only be supported for periods up to one year for longevity..\\" See also * Dental restorative materials * Dental bonding References Category:Composite materials Category:Dental materials ","title":"Dental composite"},{"id":"1881472","text":"Linn Grove may refer to a place in the United States: *Linn Grove, Indiana *Linn Grove, Iowa ","title":"Linn Grove"},{"id":"1881482","text":"Joe Vialls ( 1944 ‚Äì 17 July 2005) was a conspiracy theorist and internet journalist based in Perth, Western Australia. His claims that major incidents such as the Port Arthur massacre, terror attacks in Bali and Jakarta and the 2004 Asian tsunami were the work of Israeli and American secret agents gained a measure of notoriety in Australia, America and Indonesia. Published work Joe Vialls self-published a number of books including Deadly Deception at Port Arthur, The Murder of Policewoman Yvonne Fletcher and Lockerbie and the Bombing of Pan Am 103, and was the author of hundreds of internet articles. Many of Vialls' investigations blamed significant world events ‚Äì such as the 2004 Asian tsunami ‚Äì on joint CIA‚ÄìMossad operations, and Vialls maintained in disclaimers on his site that his reports were written in the interest of public safety. In other investigations, Vialls supposedly proved that such esoteric happenings as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and a scandal involving the wearing of a swastika by Prince Harry were Zionist plots. It has been claimed that much of his published work is anti-Semitic and anti-American in nature. Three major investigations #The first major Vialls investigation was into the 1984 murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in St. James's Square. He concluded that the fatal shots had come not from within the embassy but from a penthouse flat next-door-but-one to the Libyan embassy, and were fired by CIA/Mossad agents. #The second investigation concerned the 1988 Lockerbie bombing together with day-by-day summaries of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial. Vialls developed his own theory about the true cause of the bombing. Again, Vialls linked the CIA and Mossad to the crime. #The third major investigation was into the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, Australia. Vialls claimed that an intellectually impaired man, Martin Bryant, was wrongly convicted for this crime and did not receive a fair trial. Vialls claimed that this case, also, was an Israeli operation carried out by Mistaravim. Other controversies Vialls was a self-proclaimed private investigator dedicated to \\"exposing media disinformation,\\" and made many claims in his reports disputing official explanations for events. The website thewebfairy.com wrote a comprehensive report, rebutting Vialls' claims regarding the crash of American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon on 11 September 2001. The rebuttal centred mainly on Vialls' comparison of the Pentagon crash with an incident in which an Israeli El Al 747-200F cargo plane, flight 1862, crashed into a 12-story apartment block in the Amsterdam suburb of Bijlmer on 4 October 1992. He also disputed the official explanation for the bombings of the Australian embassy and Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Vialls asserted that the explosives that authorities claimed were used in the Indonesian bombings were not powerful enough to have caused the damage and casualties that resulted. He claimed to demonstrate from photographs of the aftermath of each of the bombings, compared to the photographs taken in Northern Ireland where a 1,000 pound IRA bomb did not leave a crater or strip concrete from buildings, that a \\"micronuke\\" from Mossad's Dimona research and development facility in the Negev desert had been used. Vialls claims a device similar to the smallest United States nuclear weapon known as the Davy Crockett or M-388 round, a version of the W54 warhead, a very small sub-kiloton fission device, was used in the attacks. The Mk-54 weighed about 51 lb (23 kg), with a selectable yield of 10 or 20 tons, which Vialls claimed was consistent with the damage inflicted in Bali and elsewhere. A complete Mk-54 round weighed 76 lb (34.5 kg). One criticism of Vialls' theory was the absence of any radiation in Bali after the explosion. Vialls explained this flaw by arguing that Geiger counters cannot effectively detect alpha radiation, the most likely radiation to be present after the detonation of a plutonium fission bomb, since alpha particles are large and do not penetrate the walls of the Geiger-Muller tubes adequately enough to register radiation. In his investigation of the first Bali bomb, Vialls cited an opinion article in the Jakarta Post, Indonesia's largest English-language newspaper by circulation, written by an expatriate editor at the Post, which expounded a similar theory. Vialls' theories have received popular support among leaders of some Muslim factions in Indonesia, who have cited his theories as fact. Indonesian internet forum Swara Muslim ('Muslim voice') wrote an opinion piece stating that Vialls' claim that the bombing of the Australian embassy was conducted by the CIA and Mossad was \\"based on solid fact.\\" Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir told Australia's ABC radio that he believed Vialls' theory regarding the first Bali bomb was a correct one. Death After a period of illness, Vialls was reported to have died at the Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia on 17 July 2005 of a heart attack.\\"Joe Vialls Passed Away Today\\" ReferencesSee also *Alternative theories of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Category:1944 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Australian conspiracy theorists Category:Australian bloggers Category:People from Perth, Western Australia ","title":"Joe Vialls"},{"id":"1881490","text":"Podscope was the first consumer search engine to create a 'spoken word index' for podcasts.

Born in 1954 in Montevideo, he started writing and composing in 1978, usually with a touch of humour. After a considerable success in the Uruguayan underground movement, he successfully disembarked in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1982. He slowly gained popularity, had concerts in Chile, Peru, Cuba, Brazil, Paraguay and Spain among others. His music resists classification. It results from an original mix of personal experiments, popular music, classical composition - including electroacoustic materials - and jazz. He often bases his pieces on the minimalistic repetition of short elements. His lyrics include frequent puns. Overall, his production adopts a tone both ironic and critical, always intelligent and witty, sometimes nihilistic. He recorded more than 40 albums, most of them released in Uruguay and Argentina. In 2003 his opera \\"Maldoror\\" was performed in the Teatro Col√≥n. He also wrote over 40 books with novels, short stories and plays. 10 of his plays were taken to theater. The Konex Foundation of Argentina awarded him \\"Merit for humour in literature\\" in 1994.

It consists of the Millstream Way following the course of the River Cole from Yardley Wood to Small Heath and includes the following sites: Scribers Lane SINC, Trittiford Mill Pool, The Dingles, Chinn Brook Recreation Ground, Sarehole Mill Recreation Ground, Moseley Bog LNR, Burbury Brickworks, The John Morris Jones Walkway and Cocksmoor BMX. History River Cole's race to Sarehole Mill formerly went under Brook Lane in a culvert, but this has been blocked and the line of the race is lost to northward. The spillway from race to river is seen to be still there, and the slots for the removable plank weir can be seen.The Waters of Yardley John Morris Jones The riverside walk continues as the John Morris Jones Walkway past the site of Robin Hood Lane ford, across Cotterills Meadow which has been Colebank Playing Field for the last ninety years until it reaches the Grade II Listed water mill, Sarehole Mill at Hall Green. The Coldbath Brook, a tributary of the Cole, drives the mill which is now a museum and one of the inspirations for J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The Shire Country Park ranger office is located at Sarehole Mill. Sarehole Mill Tolkien and his brother spent their childhood in Birmingham with their widowed mother. They first lived in the hamlet of Sarehole, which Tolkien said were the happiest years of his youth. Sarehole is said to have been the model for The Shire, home to the hobbits. Every year the Tolkien Weekend is held at Sarehole Recreation Ground and Moseley Bog Local Nature Reserve part of the Shire Country Park. 2005 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the release of The Lord of the Rings. Ronald and his brother spent many hours playing around Sarehole Mill and being chased away by the miller's son. The Mill features in The Hobbit when Bilbo Baggins runs \\"as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water and then on for a mile or more.\\" In the 1960s Tolkien contributed to a public appeal to restore the mill which had become dilapidated. It is now a museum and is the only surviving water mill in the city's ownership. Continuing to Green Lane ford which, like those at Slade and Scribers Lane, has been concreted and the wooden footbridge is the latest of many, earlier ones have been swept away by sudden torrents. When the meadow below Green Road was opened as part of the riverside walk in the 1960s, the Cole was re-coursed and two weirs topped by step-stones were installed. Next, the river crosses the A34, Stratford Road, the site of the former 13th-century Greet Mill, whose pool was the ponded river. In 1914 two brick bridges, over the river channel and a flood-race, were replaced by a two-arched brick bridge with a stone balustrade which allowed tramcars to cross the river and go on to Hall Green. The mill went out of use about 1843, was demolished and forgotten. Between Stratford Road and Formans Road, known in the 14th century as Foulemoreslone and which used the Fole- or Fullford (foul ford)Victor Skipp, Medieval Yardley, Phillimore, 1970, p.31. the stretch is known as Blackberry Way, being named after consultation with local residents and highly suitable, as this is one of the best blackberry picking sections of The Shire Country Park. The river is bridged by the A41, Warwick Road at Greet, there is no documentary evidence for a ford here, and then continues north, passing under the Grand Union Canal and the Chiltern Main Line railway at Hay Mills close to the Ackers trust outdoor pursuits centre.

The notion cohort is to be taken not in the strict, military sense (primarily the constitutive unit of a Roman legion; circa battalion), but indicated a fairly large number; accordingly, friend is to be taken in a loose sense, rather as in amicus curiae; compare the Hellenistic aulic title philos [basilikos]. Roman history * Originally, since the Roman republic proper (i.e. before the Principate), the cohors amicorum was synonymous with the cohors praetoria (so called after the praetorium, the tent -in the field- or more permanent dwelling of a Roman commanding general, military headquarters but also site of his other actions, e.g. as a judge, possibly on an adjoining podium called tribunal) : the military (including or annexing various logistic, domestic, financial and administrative) staff company functioning as suite and bodyguard of a high Roman official, such as a Roman governor (who brought a trusted staff of most kinds with him to his post), especially in command of one or more legions. *In the Principate, high administrative offices tended to be separated from military command (transferred to imperial legates), but the various not strictly military functions still had to be acquitted, so there was a mainly civilian 'company' of clerks, advisors, retainers etcetera, still referred to be such terms as cohors (amicorum), amici (possibly specified by the pivotal personality, e.g. Amici principis around the Emperor). In fact, the administration was to be streamlined in a rather typical officium (see that article) with ever more detailed rules on competences, career etcetera. The 'company' remained at least as a social notion, if now very informal, and seems to have existed with other persons of high rank, such as imperial princes. * its members were termed cohortalis (plural cohortales); the diminutive cohortalinus became a generic term (like apparitor) for non-cadre clerks in a high dignitary's officium (mainly administrative staff) See also * For an alternative, highly formalised evolution of and from the originally parallel notion comitatus (also 'company'), see the article Comes * From this sense of cohors derives the Italian corte '(a princely etc.) court' and hence corteggio 'cort√®ge', which again came to mean a train of attendants or retinue, a similarly elastic notion * the modern military also knows special units performing various services to a command and its headquarters, by such terms as staff company or staff battalion Sources and references * Johann Oehler, Cohors amicorum, in: Pauly-Wissowa (German-language encyclopaedia on nearly everything relevant to Classical Antiquity) *EtymologyOnLine Category:Court titles Category:Ancient Roman society ","title":"Cohors amicorum"},{"id":"1881501","text":"Shams ad-Dƒ´n adh-Dhahabƒ´ (), also known as Shams ad-Dƒ´n Ab≈´  øAbdillƒÅh Mu·∏•ammad ibn A·∏•mad ibn  øUthmƒÅn ibn QƒÅymƒÅ·∫ì ibn  øAbdillƒÅh at-TurkumƒÅnƒ´ al-FƒÅriqƒ´ ad- Dimashqƒ´ (October 1274 ‚Äì 3 February 1348Hoberman, Barry (September‚ÄìOctober 1982). \\"The Battle of Talas\\", Saudi Aramco World, p. 26-31.

At some point, they moved to Damascus. His name, ibn adh-Dhahabi (son of the goldsmith), reveals his father's profession. He began his study of hadith at age eighteen, travelling from Damascus to Baalbek, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Nabulus, Cairo, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Hijaz, and elsewhere, before returning to Damascus to teach and write. He authored many works and achieved wide renown as a perspicuous critic and expert examiner of the hadith.

The theatre was a permanent home for Barry Jackson's Birmingham Repertory Company, formed in 1911 from his amateur theatre group, The Pilgrim Players, founded in 1907. Jackson funded the construction of the theatre and established his professional company there. Architect S. N. Cooke, a colleague from the Birmingham School of Art collaborated with Barry Jackson in the creation of the theatre. Both Jackson and Cooke took inspiration from the democratic nature of theatres they had visited in Germany. The design of The Old Rep was particularly influenced by Max Littmann's 1908 K√ºnstlertheater in Munich. In 2014, Birmingham Ormiston Academy, also known as BOA, successfully tendered for The Old Rep Theatre. The theatre is situated just opposite New Street Station, from which a blue plaque, above the theatre's first floor windows, to Barry Jackson can be seen. Two doors down is Britain's oldest working cinema, the Electric Cinema. History Construction on the venue began in October 1912 and continued day and night for four months. The Grade II listed building has been well- preserved and still retains many of its original features. The theatre opened its doors on 15 February 1913 with a performance of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, preceded by a reading from Barry Jackson, of the poem The Mighty Line by resident playwright John Drinkwater (playwright). The company began what would become more than a century of history with a vision led by Jackson that theatre should \\"serve as art instead of making that art serve a commercial purpose.\\" With a wealth of local talent, the theatre produced a rolling bill of plays, both classic texts and new writing. In 1917, the Birmingham Repertory Company became a pioneer in the theatre industry by becoming the first UK venue to appoint a female stage manager, Maud Gill. She left a fascinating and entertaining account of her experiences in her autobiography 'See the Players'. She was told that \\"a woman ought not to be put in charge of stagehands because \\"working men\\" would not take orders from her, but she decided that, since mothers has been keeping order in the home since the beginning of time, the way to go about it was to treat them as a mother would treat her family. It worked.\\" In 1923, Barry Jackson received a gold medal from the Birmingham Civic Society which was shortly followed by a knighthood in 1925 for his services to the theatre. Sir Barry Jackson's significant role in the Birmingham's arts scene was to be recognised once again in 1955 when he was awarded the freedom of the city. The theatre were awarded their first Arts Council England grant in 1954 worth ¬£3,000 which now equates to ¬£77,000. Shortly after in 1960, Barry Jackson met with Birmingham City Council and Arts Council England to guarantee the funding to build a new arts venue. This was eventually agreed in 1968, and plans for the new Rep began to take place. In 1971 they moved to a newly built theatre on Broad Street, now known as Birmingham Repertory Theatre, with The Old Rep taken into ownership by Birmingham City Council. However, this wasn't the last time the company would be based at Station Street, returning to The Old Rep between 2011 and 2013 while the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Library of Birmingham underwent redevelopment. The company celebrated their centenary year at their original home with a programme of performances, tours and creative activities for the people of Birmingham. Patrons of The Old Rep include Brian Cox (actor), Brian Blessed, June Brown, Annette Badland and Toyah Willcox. Performers The Old Rep has played a central role in the early careers of many of the UK's most celebrated actors and theatre-makers.

Sarehole Mill is a Grade II listed water mill, in an area once called Sarehole, on the River Cole in Hall Green, Birmingham, England. It is now run as a museum by the Birmingham Museums Trust. It is known for its association with J. R. R. Tolkien and is one of only two working water mills in Birmingham, with the other being New Hall Mill in Walmley, Sutton Coldfield. History Built in 1542 on the site of a previous mill. It was once known as Bedell's or Biddle's Mill after the name of an early owner. In 1727 it was described as High Wheel Mill. As early as 1755, the mill was leased by Matthew Boulton, one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution and leading figure of the Lunar Society for scientific experimentation. It is believed he converted the machinery for use in metal working. As well as milling grain it has been used for grinding bones for fertiliser, metal rolling (Matthew Boulton), tool sharpening and wire drawing. The current building dates from 1771 and was in use until 1919. Thereafter it fell into a state of disrepair and dereliction. A local community campaign to save the mill was launched when demolition was mooted, and was finally successful with the mill being restored in 1969. Sarehole Mill is open from Easter to the end of October, 12:00 till 16:00 every day except Monday unless Monday is a national holiday in which case it is open, entry ¬£3.00, children under 16 free. In April 2012 the mill pond was drained to repair the sluice gates, and in the winter of 2012‚Äì13 the heavily silted mill pond was dredged. In 2012/2013 Sarehole Mill underwent a ¬£375,000 overhaul of the roof, chimney, millpond, water wheel and machinery were restored to produce flour again. A newly constructed outdoor bread oven is used regularly to bake bread using the flour ground on site. Sarehole Mill has a team of 10 volunteer millers, 15 volunteer gardeners and eight volunteer guides. The site received 17,909 visitors in 2018. Millers are at work every Wednesday and Sunday if there is enough water. Sarehole Mill produces wholemeal flour which is sold in the mill shop. The flour is also used by local restaurants and bakers. Flood damage during 2019 prevented the milling of flour on the site, with repairs beginning soon after. In February 2020, the site's Victorian bakery was restored, and a permanent modern bakery was also installed. Baked goods were made available in the Millers Tea Room, and the original bakery is used for demonstrations of traditional baking techniques. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mill was temporarily closed, like all locations managed by the Birmingham Museums Trust. Steam engine The steam engine at Sarehole Mill In 1852 the water wheels at Sarehole Mill were supplemented by a single cylinder steam engine. Although water would have been the primary energy source powering the mill, the addition of a steam engine would have ensured uninterrupted operation of the mill. Unfortunately the original steam engine was at some point removed, the current engine is of similar size and capacity, being a single cylinder table engine of , albeit currently in a non-functioning state and of unknown manufacturer.Sarehole Mill on-site information panel The current engine was installed as part of the restoration of the mill in 1975. It was formerly used by a sweet manufacturer, Smith Kendon Ltd, at their factories in England and Messina, Italy, where it was used up until 1948. It was donated to the Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry in 1952 before being moved to Sarehole. J. R. R. Tolkien J. R. R. Tolkien lived within 300 yards of the mill at around the turn of century, between the ages four and eight, and would have seen it from his house. The locale at that time was rural Worcestershire farmland and countryside. He has also said that he used the mill as a location in The Lord of the Rings, for the Mill at Hobbiton. In an interview with Guardian journalist, John Ezard in 1966, before the mill's restoration, Tolkien said: The grounds nearby host the annual Tolkien Weekend event that celebrates the life and works of Tolkien. The mill is part of the Shire Country Park.  Sources  * Birmingham, page 13, Douglas Hickman, 1970, Studio Vista Ltd. * Hall Green and Hereabout, John Morris JONES, ed.

Although their commercial success was limited by the small amount of recorded material they released, they have been credited as highly influential on the Postcard Records scene and the indie pop genre which followed. Career=Early days The core of the band was singer-songwriter, Vic Godard, plus assorted soul fans, who congregated around early gigs by the Sex Pistols until Malcolm McLaren suggested they form their own band. Subway Sect were among the performers at the 100 Club Punk Festival on Monday, 21 September 1976 ‚Äì sharing the bill with Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash and the Sex Pistols. The first line-up of Godard on vocals, Paul Packham on drums, Paul Myers on bass and Rob Symmons on guitar lasted for four gigs before Mark Laff replaced Packham. Laff himself then left for fellow punk group Generation X after the White Riot tour. A third drummer, Bob Ward, was recruited, and it is this line-up that can be heard on the band's first John Peel session and also on the single \\"Nobody's Scared\\". This was the first and only release on Braik Records, a label owned by Bernie Rhodes, who managed both Subway Sect and The Clash. Rhodes subsequently supervised the recording of their debut album at Gooseberry Studios in London, with Clash sound man and producer Mickey Foote at the production helm. At that time the band toured intensively with The Clash and others. However, just as their first album was ready for release, for reasons that remain obscure, Rhodes sacked all the band (except Godard) and Subway Sect mark 1 ceased to exist. The album was never released, although a single from the sessions \\"Ambition\\" was remixed and released on Rough Trade Records, with the B-side \\"Different Story (Rock and Roll Even)\\" also taken from the same sessions. \\"Ambition\\" was ranked at No. 15 among the top \\"Tracks of the Year\\" for 1978 by NME. A further track \\"Parallel Lines\\" was released as a track on the C81 cassette produced by NME magazine. Since then, some monitor copies of tracks from the lost album have come to light on various Subway Sect compilations, including a Motion Records' 20 Odd Years double album anthology, and a CD and CD/EP set We Oppose All Rock And Roll on Overground Records. Any copies of the actual album tapes appear to no longer exist. As a result of 1977 appearances at The Roxy club in London, live recordings were made of Subway Sect performances by Don Letts, the club's disc jockey. Subway Sect appears in Letts' Punk Rock Movie (1978). Middle years Godard reformed the band and as 'Vic Godard and Subway Sect' finally released their debut album What's the Matter, Boy? in 1980, following a period of shifting group personnel. The album features many songs written during the previous incarnation of the band, but performed with radically altered arrangements. By this time, Godard had become increasingly influenced by early rockabilly, and the \\"first wave\\" of rock and roll (Sun Records session era Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran etc.). This was just before the rockabilly revival, and the album was ignored as being 'retro'. Ignoring this, Godard then went further back in time, teaming up with guitarist Rob Marche, keyboardist Dave Collard, bassist Chris Bostock and drummer Sean McLusky with subsequent releases (inc. Songs for Sale ‚Äì credited to Vic Godard and The Subway Sect), showing the influence of the \\"rat pack\\" (Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra), and 1940s swing, many years before these sounds became fashionable again. Faced by dwindling sales and following a solo album (T.R.O.U.B.L.E.) backed by Working Week, Godard left the music business and became a postman. In 1982, former Subway Sect members ‚Äì Rob Marche, Dave Collard, Chris Bostock and Sean McLusky ‚Äì teamed up with American singer Dig Wayne and formed the band Jo Boxers. Revival In the 1990s a slow Godard revival began. Backed by the re- release of his work on CD and numerous compilation albums, Godard returned to recording, initially under his own name. In 2002, a CD was issued credited purely to Subway Sect, thus reviving the name, if not the original band. Named Sansend, it was a sample and beats heavy collection of new songs, and it was followed three years later by Motion's Singles Anthology, which collected single A and B sides. Original Subway Sect guitarist and bass player, Rob Symmons and Paul Myers resurfaced as The Fallen Leaves in 2004, although Myers has since quit the band. Rob Symmons still performs and records with the band. In 2007, a new Subway Sect (featuring on some recordings original members Mark Laff and Paul Myers, as well as former Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook) released 1978 Now, a re-make of the original 1978 album as, Godard indicated, it had originally sounded. In 2011, Myers rejoined Vic Godard and Subway Sect permanently; his first official gig back was at Nambucca in London on 28 October 2011. Further vintage material was recorded in 2012 ‚Äì again with Paul Cook on drums ‚Äì and released in 2014 as 1979 Now. As of 2019, the current Subway Sect line-up of Godard and Johnny Britton with a returned Chris Bostock and Sean McLusky has a new album Moments Like These due for release in 2020, produced by Mick Jones and previewed by single \\"How High The Walls\\" out on 25 December that year.

In Indian cinema, an item number or item song is a musical number inserted into a film that may or may not have any relevance to the plot. The term is commonly used within Indian films (Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Bengali) to describe a catchy, upbeat, often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie.Journals : Item number defined The main aim of an item number is to entertain movie-goers and to lend support to the marketability of the film by being featured in trailers. They are favored by filmmakers as they afford the opportunity pick potential hit songs from the stocks, since they do not add to the continuity of the plot. It is thus a vehicle for commercial success that ensures repeat viewing. A female actor, singer, or dancer, especially someone who is poised to become a star, who appears in an item number is known as an item girl (there are item boys as well). However, second-generation South Asian women are more commonly featured in item numbers than men. Item numbers usually feature one or more persons other than the lead actors. Sometimes, established female and male actors will appear in item numbers (a phenomenon billed as a \\"special appearance\\" by that actor). Although the origin of the term \\"item number\\" is obscure, it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women. This is because item in Mumbai film slang is used by Indian men to objectify women. The classic meaning of item number refers to highly sexualized songs with racy imagery and suggestive lyrics. The item number would feature an item girl who appeared in the film as a dancer, usually in a bar or nightclub, and was only in the film for the duration of that song. History=1930s1970s Up to the 1970s, Bollywood often relied on a female \\"vamp\\" character ‚Äì usually playing the role of a cabaret dancer, tawaif/prostitute/courtesan, or male gangster's moll ‚Äì to provide musical entertainment deemed more risqu√©. While film heroines also sang and danced, it was the vamp who wore more revealing clothes, smoked, drank, and sang sexually suggestive lyrics. The vamp was portrayed as immodest rather than evil, and her dance performances were sexualized by male producers. The trend was started by Cuckoo in films like Awaara (1951), Aan (1952) and Shabistan (1951). Vyjayanthimala as Chandramukhi in Devdas Item numbers had been featured in Bollywood from as early as the 1930s. Azoorie in the 1930s often performed item numbers; Cuckoo was the next popular item dancer in the late 40s. Her banner year was 1949 when she was featured in over 17 films performing dances. Actress and classical dancer Vyjayanthimala was the one that introduced the classical dance number in Hindi films with her debut film Bahar (1951). The mixture of classical plus contemporary was popularized by Vyjayanthimala in films such as Devdas (1955), Amrapali (1966), Madhumati (1958), Sadhna (1958), Sunghursh (1968) etc. In the early 50s, Cuckoo introduced the Anglo-Burmese Helen as a chorus girl. In time Helen would come to be the most popular vamp of the late-50s, 60s and 70s, having had performed in scores of item numbers including such popular songs as \\"Mera Naam Chin Chin Choo\\" from the film Howrah Bridge (1958), \\"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\\" from Caravan (1971), \\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\\" from Sholay (1975) and \\"Yeh Mera Dil\\" from Don (1978). The song's tune was also used in Don't Phunk with My Heart, \\"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\\" from Teesri Manzil and \\"Aa Jaane Jaan\\". In films like Gunga Jumna and Zindagi the actor performed semi-classical Indian dances in songs like \\"Tora man bada paapi\\" and \\"Ghungarwa mora chham chham baaje\\". A desi bar number, \\"Mungda\\" from Inkaar was also immensely popular. In addition to her skillful dancing, her anglicised looks too helped further the vamp image. Helen's dominance pushed other vying item number dancers like Madhumati, Bela Bose, Laxmi Chhaya, Jeevankala, Aruna Irani, Sheela R. and Sujata Bakshi into the background and less prestigious and low budget b-movies. In the early part of the 1970s actresses Jayshree T., Bindu, Aruna Irani and Padma Khanna entered into what was Helen's monopoly. Another noted feature of this era was the \\"tribal and banjara\\" item numbers such as the one in the Dharmendra, Zeenat Aman and Rex Harrison starrer Shalimar. Such songs provided the necessary settings for the lead couple's love to bloom. 1980s1990s Around the 1980s the vamp and the heroine merged into one figure and the lead actress had begun to perform the bolder numbers. The craze for \\"tribal and banjara\\" item numbers were soon gave way to slick choreography. In the late 1990s, with the proliferation of film songs based television shows, film producers had come to realise that an exceptional way to entice audiences into theaters was by spending excessively on the visualization of songs. Hence regardless of the theme and plot, an elaborate song and dance routine involving spectacularly lavish sets, costumes, special effects, extras and dancers would invariably be featured in a film. It was asserted that this contributed highly to the film's \\"repeat value\\". Madhuri Dixit Madhuri Dixit is often considered to be the pioneer of the modern trend. In the late 1980s, the song \\"Ek Do Teen\\" was added to the movie Tezaab as an afterthought, but it transformed Dixit and made her a superstar. Her partnership with choreographer Saroj Khan has resulted in numerous hits including the controversial \\"Choli ke peeche kya hai\\" and \\"Dhak Dhak\\" (Beta). Soon after the release of the film Khal Nayak, there were press reports stating that people were seeing the film again and again but only for the song \\"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\\" that featured Dixit. Although there have been many songs that fit the descriptions of item numbers in the early and mid-1990s, the term itself was coined when Shilpa Shetty danced for \\"Main Aai Hoon UP Bihar Lootne\\" in the movie Shool. This is perhaps the first time the media actually referred to Shetty as an \\"item girl\\" and the scene as an \\"item number\\". 2000s Since 2000, many top Bollywood stars now do item numbers, and many new women entering Bollywood find item numbers a more amenable shortcut to success, as opposed to more traditional roles with no guarantee of eventual stardom. Former item girls in pop songs outside films, Rakhi Sawant and Meghna Naidu, for example, are now in demand and very popular. Today, they are even being given lead roles in movies. As of 2007, Mallika Sherawat had become the most expensive item girl, charging Rs. 15 million (roughly US$375,000) for the song \\"Mehbooba Mehbooba\\" in Aap Ka Suroor - The Real Love Story. Another example is actress Urmila Matondkar, one of the most successful item girls during that time. She was featured in \\"Chamma Chamma\\" in the 1998 film China Gate. Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film musical, Moulin Rouge! used a westernized version of this song. Malaika Arora and Yana Gupta are \\"official\\" item number dancers and have said in interviews that they don't want to act in movies since they already earn more than enough money just by doing one item number as opposed to full-on roles. Abhishek Bachchan became the first \\"item boy\\" with his performance in Rakht; Shahrukh Khan performed an item number of sorts during the opening credits of Kaal but later had an item number in a truer sense of the word with \\"Dard-e-disco\\" in Om Shanti Om, where he was shot in a more typical \\"item girl\\" manner, with Khan wearing minimal clothing (though this number did have a connection, albeit tenuous, with the plot of the film). In Krazzy 4, Hrithik Roshan has an item number during the end credits. Ranbir Kapoor made his debut in an item number in Chillar Party (2011); drawing inspiration from his father Rishi Kapoor's Qawwali song \\"Parda Hai Parda\\" from Amar Akbar Anthony. In 2005 and 2006 actress Bipasha Basu gave blockbuster hit numbers like No Entry and Beedi Jalaile. In the 2007 Telugu film Desamuduru, the song \\"Attaantode Ittaantode\\" featuring Allu Arjun and Rambha became a chartbuster. In the 2007 film Om Shanti Om, the song \\"Deewangi Deewangi\\" had guest appearances by over 30 Bollywood stars. In 2008, the makers of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi featured Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Priety Zinta, and Rani Mukerji playing five leading ladies opposite Shahrukh Khan in the song \\"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\\". 2010s In 2010, Katrina Kaif featured in \\"Sheila Ki Jawani\\" from Tees Maar Khan, and Malaika Arora featured in \\"Munni Badnaam Hui\\" from Dabangg. Parallels were drawn between Katrina and Malaika, as well as between the item numbers, in what was popularly known as the \\"Munni vs Sheila\\" debate. The songs became so popular, that, soon, more films began incorporating item numbers, and with more top stars now wanting to do them. In 2012, Katrina Kaif again featured in an item number \\"Chikni Chameli\\" sung by Shreya Ghoshal which became a huge hit. In 2013, Deepika Padukone had some success item dancing, performing songs like \\"Party On My Mind\\" and \\"Lovely\\". Priyanka Chopra did many songs such as \\"Babli Badmaash\\", \\"Pinky\\", and an appearance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela song \\"Ram Chahe Leela\\", of which became a blockbuster upon release. Mahi Gill, Sonakshi Sinha, and Jacqueline Fernandez made their debut with \\"Don't Touch My Body\\", \\"Govinda Govinda\\" and \\"Jadu Ki Jappi\\" respectively. Indian-Canadian actress Sunny Leone performed her first item dance with \\"Laila\\" from the 2013 film \\"Shootout at Wadala\\", followed up with Baby Doll from Ragini MMS 2. In 2017, Sunny Leone featured in the hit item number \\"Laila Main Laila\\" starring Shah Rukh Khan in the film Raees. It is a recreation of the song \\"Laila O Laila\\" from the 1980 film Qurbani, which featured actress Zeenat Aman with Feroz Khan in the original musical number. In 2017, Anglo-Indian actress Amanda Rosario featured in the hit item number \\"Sarkar\\" sung by Rani Hazarika from the movie Udanchhoo. In 2018, Moroccan-Canadian dancer-actress Nora Fatehi featured in the item song \\"Dilbar\\" which has become one of the most popular Bollywood music videos of all time. It is a recreation of an item number of the same name from Sirf Tum (1999), which was composed by Nadeem‚ÄìShravan and featured Sushmita Sen as an item girl. The re-created version by Tanishk Bagchi features Middle-Eastern musical sounds. In the music video, Nora Fatehi performs belly dancing, an Arabic dance style that was previously featured in a number of popular Bollywood item numbers, performed by actresses such as Helen in \\"Mehbooba O Mehbooba\\" from Sholay (1975), Zeenat Aman in \\"Raqqasa Mera Naam\\" from The Great Gambler (1979), Mallika Sherawat in \\"Mayya Mayya\\" from Guru (2007), and Rani Mukerji in \\"Aga Bai\\" from Aiyyaa (2012). TV and Bollywood Actress Mouni Roy made her debut by \\"Nachna Aunda Nahi\\". The \\"Gali Gali\\" track sung by Neha Kakkar, which featured Mouni Roy also, was a huge hit. The international success of \\"Dilbar\\" inspired an Arabic-language version, also featuring Nora Fatehi. \\"Dilbar\\" is popular across Southern Asia and the Arab world, with all versions of the song having received more than 1billion views on YouTube, making it the most-viewed song on the T-Series YouTube channel. Criticism and controversies Item numbers have been criticized for their gratuitous objectification of women. Item numbers have also been imitated by Mumbai's bar dancers. In respect of the ban on bar dancers in Mumbai, it has even been argued that the morality of bar dancer's imitation of item numbers cannot be questioned without questioning the morality of screening of item numbers in a film in public theatres. It has also been argued that the two are equally amoral as both objectify women for commercial gain, with likely negative effects on the male population. As one writer put it, \\"On paper, item numbers form the perfect formula for female sexual empowerment. In reality, they mostly result in the most blatant objectification. Camera angles zoom in over gyrating hips and linger over bare waists as blatantly as the eyes of the ogling men with no subtlety. The gaze in these dance numbers presents itself as vaguely voyeuristic, at best. There is a very deliberate implication present; that the item girl is not only inviting the leers and jeers,but she is also enjoying them.\\" In 1993, the Bollywood action thriller Khalnayak was instantly controversial for its item numbers and risqu√© song lyrics. While the lyrics of \\"Choli Ke Peechhe?\\" (\\"What's behind the blouse?\\") were considered vulgar by some, others defended the song on the ground that it was based on folk traditions. The song eventually set off protests all over the country and a potential ban on the song was debated in the Indian Parliament. The anger and commotion, however, only helped the song and the film become more popular, as many went to the movie theater out of curiosity, to watch Madhuri Dixit perform the song. In 2013, the Central Board of Film Certification issued a resolution declaring that item numbers will now be rated as adult content and will be banned from being shown on television channels.

The gorge is approximately 1.5 km long, 60 m deep, and 10 m wide at its lip. The Abhainn Droma flows through Corrieshalloch, below which the landscape opens out into a broad, flat- bottomed glacial trough at the head of Loch Broom.

The gorge has been owned since 1945 by the National Trust for Scotland who manage it and the surrounding area jointly with NatureScot. Formation Corrieshalloch Gorge is one of the most spectacular gorges in Scotland, and demonstrates how erosion resulting from the rapid melting of glaciers at lead to the formation of deep gorges. The gorge formed at the end of the Quaternary ice age around 10-13,000 years, as the meltwater from ice sheets that covered northern Scotland between 2.6 million and 11,500 years ago exploited existing lines of weakness in the Moine bedrock. Visitor facilities A 25 m long footbridge spans the gorge below the falls. The bridge was constructed by Sir John Fowler, who was also one of the designers of the Forth Bridge. Access to the footbridge is via a 300-metre-long path from the car park on the South side of the gorge. There is a charge of ¬£2 payable using an honesty box at the start of the path. A viewing platform has been installed which projects out into the gorge. The bridge was closed to the public in 2010 following the discovery of unacceptable wear and tear, but was reopened in January 2011 after temporary repair work. It was closed again in the winter of 2011/12 for longer term repairs. Shortly before it was due to be reopened in April 2012, consulting engineers discovered cracks in several deck support hangers, and the entire site, including gorge-side paths, was closed until these could be replaced. It fully re-opened in late May 2012 after refurbishment and repairs were completed, however as of 2018 the Trust recommend that no more than 6 people use the bridge at any one time.The National Trust for Scotland Guide, 2018. p. 95 In December 2019, a ¬£2.3m investment in upgraded parking and a visitor centre was announced.Ross-shire Journal, 28 December 2019. Nature and conservation The gorge provides a habitat for plants that have largely disappeared from the surrounding areas due to grazing pressures. The dark, humid walls of the gorge support ferns, feather mosses and sanicle; wood millet, a plant otherwise rare in northwest Scotland. Higher up, the more sunlit slopes support trees such as wych elm, birch, sycamore, Norway maple and beech. The wooded parts of the gorge support a population of the cranefly species Lipsothrix ecucullata, which is nationally rare. The larvae of this species inhabit wet, decayed wood, whilst the mature adults inhabit damp deciduous woodlands.

Antonio Da Ponte was head architect of the rebuilding of the Ducal Palace that was badly damaged by fire in 1574. cites Giulio Lorenzetti Venice and its Lagoon After the original wooden structure of the Rialto Bridge had collapsed repeatedly, it was decided that a stone bridge was necessary. Between 1588 and 1591 da Ponte rebuilt the Rialto Bridge to a design to which he had contributed. The design was selected in a contest held by the local authorities under Doge of Venice Pasquale Cicogna. Though Da Ponte is relatively unknown otherwise, the design for the Venice landmark defeated submissions by noted architects of the time, including Michelangelo. Plans were offered by famous architects such as Jacopo Sansovino, Andrea Palladio and Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, but all involved a Classical approach with several arches, which was judged inappropriate to the situation. The engineering of the bridge throws considerable weight on its foundations. It was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. However the bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons of Venice. In the construction of this work Antonio was helped by his nephew Antonio Contino, who would also later design the famous Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri). In 1841, the Parisian architect Antoine Rondelet wrote about the suspicious similarities between Antonio da Ponte's project and the one by Vincenzo Scamozzi.

Tynwald Day, July 5, corresponded to St John's feast day by the Julian calendar, which was the date held to be midsummer day; so Tynwald Day was a midsummer fair. Chapel of St John (Tynwald Church)The Anglican church in the village is dedicated to St John and the village takes its name from the church. Within the church are reserved seats with name plaques for members of both branches of the Manx parliament, whilst in the adjacent church hall is an exhibition detailing the history of Tynwald. Other features of the village The village is dominated by , a steep hill to its south. The Tynwald National Park (also known as the Arboretum) is situated on the east side of the village. Opposite the church is the site of the ancient pound where stray animals were placed until claimed. If unclaimed after a year and a day they became the property of the Lord of Mann, whilst the recovery fee for reclaimed animals was shared equally between the Lord of Mann and the pound official, the \\"pindar\\".https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/4615384 Also displayed on that site are large stones from a 2300 BC burial chamber found locally. The main commercial venture of the village is Tynwald Mills, which claims to be the only department store in the island. Road transport The village is on the A1 Douglas to Peel road. It is also close to the junction with the A3, which leads in a southerly direction to Foxdale and Castletown, and northerly to Kirk Michael, Ballaugh, Sulby and Ramsey. It is thus conveniently located for access from all parts of the island (even before these roads were built), which is believed to have been a consideration in the original location of Tynwald here. Former railway station The village's railway station has long since closed. In its day it was a major railway junction, in the context of the Isle of Man: it was on the Isle of Man Railway (Peel line), the Manx Northern Railway and the Foxdale Railway. The trackbed of the Isle of Man Railway is now used as a footpath, named the Steam Heritage Trail. Primary school Since 2003, the former St John's School building has been used by the (the Manx language primary school).

He campaigned for rights of the Mauritian Creole people. Kaya died in prison in 1999. A popular R√©unionese seggae musician is Baster, and Kaya is the most important and known artist in the seggae genre of music, often being dubbed \\"Bob Marley of Seggae\\".  Composition of seggae music  Seggae music, just as reggae music, can be composed of either just as a guitar, or if played by a band, can constitute of drums, a rhythm guitar, a solo guitar, a keyboard, a bass, percussions and a singer. Unlike reggae, seggae is played at a 6/8 tempo, and 120bpm, just like the Sega music. Unlike the Sega music, the rhythmic guitar is played with an offbeat rhythm and the drum's one drop rhythm, faster than reggae. Nowadays, Seggae Artists tend to slow down the bpm to give it a more heavy and soulful touch.

He is known for his appearances with Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation as one-half of the tag team The Public Enemy with Rocco Rock. In the course of his career, Grunge held championships such as the ECW World Tag Team Championship and WCW World Tag Team Championship. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1987‚Äì1993) Grunge debuted in 1987. In 1993 in Woodbridge, New Jersey, Grunge formed a tag team in the UWF with Rocco Rock known as The Public Enemy. This was not the first time they had met though as The Public Enemy faced one another in Austria circa 1991, with Grunge (using the name \\"Johnny Rotten\\") losing to Rock (using the name \\"Cheetah Kid\\" and was masked). Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì1996) Grunge delivering a chair shot In 1993, The Public Enemy joined Eastern Championship Wrestling, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion soon to be renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling. Between March 6, 1994 and October 28, 1995, The Public Enemy held the ECW Tag Team Championship on four occasions. While in ECW, they were involved in two infamous incidents - the first when the ECW audience hurled folding chairs into the ring until The Public Enemy (both \\"unconscious\\") were submerged, and the second when the ECW audience invaded the ring to celebrate with The Public Enemy, with the ring collapsing as a result of the additional weight. They were known for their hardcore wrestling style and usage of tables, a gimmick that was later adopted by the Dudley Boyz. The Public Enemy's wrestling style was referenced in Weezer's song \\"El Scorcho\\"; the line \\"watchin' Grunge legdrop New Jack through a press table\\" was derived from a caption for a photograph of Grunge fighting wrestler New Jack that was published in Pro Wrestling Illustrated. World Championship Wrestling (1996‚Äì1999) In 1996, The Public Enemy joined the Atlanta, Georgia based World Championship Wrestling promotion. They debuted on January 15, 1996, defeating The American Males. On September 23, 1996 in Birmingham, Alabama, The Public Enemy defeated Harlem Heat to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Harlem Heat regained the titles on October 1, 1996 in Canton, Ohio. World Wrestling Federation, return to ECW and WCW (1999) The Public Enemy left WCW in 1999, and briefly wrestled for ECW before joining the World Wrestling Federation. Both men made their debut on the February 22, 1999 episode of Raw is War, but were released from the WWF two months later. On July 18 at Bash at the Beach 1999, The Public Enemy returned to WCW and took part in the \\"Junkyard Invitational\\". Independent circuit (1999‚Äì2006) They then returned to the independent circuit, making appearances with the X Wrestling Federation as The South Philly Posse, where they were managed by Jasmin St. Claire. In the early 2000s, Public Enemy performed for the short- lived i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling among other independent promotions. The team won various independent tag team titles. Following the death of Rocco Rock in 2002, Grunge teamed with his kayfabe brother Joey Grunge as The New Public Enemy throughout August 2003. He also made appearances with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW), and participated in a memorial segment for deceased ECW wrestlers at Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005. At the end of 2005, Grunge was preparing for a comeback. His cousin, Jason Ray, who wrestled for Big Japan Wrestling, helped book him for BJW's upcoming spring tour. Personal life Grunge was a neighbor of Chris Benoit and helped Benoit cope with Eddie Guerrero's death in November 2005. Grunge died at the age of 39 on February 16, 2006 in his residence in Peachtree City, Georgia as a result of sleep apnea complications.

Adjectival \\"wise\\" is used as a honorific, as in Talmid Chacham (lit. \\"student of a sage\\") for a Torah scholar, or hakham Bashi for a chief rabbi. The Talmud (Shabbat 31a) describes knowledge of the Talmudic order of Kodshim as a high level of wisdom, chokhmah. In the Kabbalah, Chokhmah is the uppermost of the sephirot of the right line (kav yamin, the \\"Pillar of Mercy\\") in the Tree of Life. It is to the bottom right of Keter, with Binah across from it. Under it are the sephirot of Chesed and Netzach. It commonly has four paths going to Keter, Binah, Tifereth, and Chesed. (Some kabbalists attribute a path between Chokhmah and Gevurah.) Hebrew Bible Proverbs personifies Divine Wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation ( cf. 3:19; ; ). Wisdom dwelt with God (; cf. ; ) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings (). It was God who \\"found\\" wisdom () and gave her to Israel: \\"He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men.\\" (; ). As a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20‚Äì33; 8:1‚Äì9:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). Wisdom 7:22b-8:1 is a famous passage describing Divine Wisdom, including the passage: \\"For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.\\" (). Solomon, as the archetypal wise person, fell in love with Wisdom: \\"I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.\\" ().For a summary account of wisdom in the Hebrew Bible cf. R.E. Murphy, \\"Wisdom in the Old Testament\\", Anchor Bible Dictionary (1992), vi. 920‚Äì931. Kabbalah According to the Bahir: \\"The second (utterance) is wisdom, as is written: 'Y-H-W-H acquired me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old' (Prov 8:22). And there is no 'beginning' but wisdom.\\"Arthur Green. A Guide to the Zohar. Chokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, \\"Wisdom comes from nothingness\\".Job. 28:12 This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in Binah.Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah The name of God associated with Chokhmah is Yah. Chokhmah appears in the configuration of the sefirot at the top of the right axis, and corresponds in the tzelem Elokim (\\"the Divine image\\") to the left eye, or right hemisphere of the brain. In its fully articulated form, Chokhmah possesses two partzufim (\\"faces\\" or \\"features\\"): the higher of these is referred to as Abba Ila'ah (\\"the higher father\\"), whereas the lower is referred to as Yisrael Saba (\\"Israel, the Elder\\"). These two partzufim are referred to jointly as Abba (\\"father\\"). Chokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness. The partzuf of Abba Ila'ah is associated with the power to spontaneously extract such insight from the superconscious realm, whereas the partzuf of Yisrael Saba is associated with the power to subsequently direct it into consciousness. The \\"wisdom\\" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. These seeds of truth can then be conveyed to the companion power of Binah for the sake of intellectual analysis and development. Chokhmah is the primary (\\"beginning\\") force in the creative process, Creativity, as it is said: \\"You have made them all with Chokhmah.\\" (Psalms 104:24) The first word of the Torah in Genesis, Breishit means \\"In the beginning (God created the heavens and the earth)\\", is translated (Targum Yonatan) as \\"With Chokhmah (God created‚Ä¶).\\" Chokhmah is also called Fear, 'because it has no measure of boundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it'.Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah The book of Job states 'Behold the fear of God is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding' (Job 28:28). In the array of sefirot in three columns (gimel kavim), Chokmah is situated at the top of the right column, and corresponds to the right hemisphere of the brain. There are several aspects of Chokhmah: The word Chokhmah itself may be broken into two words -- koach (\\"potential\\") and ma (\\"what is\\"). Thus, Chokhmah means \\"the potential of what is\\", or, \\"the potential to be.\\" This aspect of Chokhmah describes the state of Chokhmah in relation to the sefira of Keter. As Chokhmah emanates from Keter, the first dawning of the \\"Infinite Light\\", it \\"appears\\" in an obscure and undefined state that is a virtual non-being. Thus the verse states, \\"and Chokhmah emerges from nothingness\\" (Job 28:12, see Zohar II, 121a, Zohar III, 290a, commentaries). The light of the Ein Sof becomes unified in the world of Atziluth through clothing itself first in the sefira of Chokhmah. In the soul, Chokhmah is associated with the power of intuitive insight. In the Zohar Chokhmah is the primordial point which shines forth from the will of God and thus, is the starting point of Creation. All things are still undifferentiated at this point and only become intelligible at Binah. Modern occultism According to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the name of God associated with Chokmah is Jehovah, the archangel that presides over it is Raziel, the order of angels that reside in it are the Ophanim (the wheels), the Heaven of Assiah associated with it is called Mazloth, implying the fulfillment of destiny, and the mundane chakra associated with it is the Zodiac. In Aleister Crowley's Liber 777, Chokhma is represented as The Four twos of the Tarot, Illuminating, Thoth, Vishnu, Joy, Odin, Uranus, Athena, God the Father, Man, Amaranth, Lingam, Hashish, Phosphorus, Musk, and Yang (not a complete list).

The town is located on the edge of Seeadler Harbour on Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, and in 2000 Lorengau was recorded to have a population of 5,829. History=World War II During World War II Manus Island was the site of an observation post manned by No. 4 Section, 'B' Platoon, 1st Independent Company, Australian Imperial Force., who also provided medical treatment to the inhabitants. Manus was first bombed by the Japanese on 25 January 1942, the radio mast being the main target. On 8 April 1942 an Imperial Japanese force consisting of the light cruiser Tatsuta, destroyer Mutsuki and a troop transport ship Mishima Maru entered Lorengau harbour, and several hundreds of Japanese soldiers of the 8th Special Base Force, swarmed ashore onto Australia's mandated responsibility. With little and limited resources the Australian 4th section withdrew to the jungle. The Japanese established an administrative base and airstrip. In February 1944 the United States and Australian forces launched a six-week campaign to recapture the facility, which was eventually achieved on 18 March 1944. The Americans expanded the Japanese base and constructed a huge naval base at nearby Lombrum. An airstrip capable of handling heavy bombers was constructed at Momote and it was here that the invasion to capture the Philippines was staged. After the war the base was scrapped and all equipment was bulldozed into pits or the harbour. Australian immigration detention centres In 2017 Manus Regional Processing Centre was closed and the hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers who were indefinitely detained there by the Australian Government were moved, many by force, to three new centres in/near Lorengau. These new centers were West Lorengau Haus, Hillside Haus and East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre. At the time, the new centers were not finished and 60 men were left without a place to stay. Those detained at the new centres were allowed to leave the centres during the day (with restrictions), but could not leave Manus Island. Paladin Group, a multinational security company and service provider (owned and operated by two Australian men, through a Singapore holding company), are contracted to provide IT, security, local transport and some site management for the Lorengau Centres. Paladin's contract is worth over $400 million AUD. Climate Lorengau has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.

J. (2000). Chironex fleckeri ‚Äì the north Australian box-jellyfish. marine-medic.com It has been described as \\"the most lethal jellyfish in the world\\", with at least 63 known deaths in Australia from 1884 to 1996. Notorious for its sting, C. fleckeri has tentacles up to long covered with millions of cnidocytes which, on contact, release microscopic darts delivering an extremely powerful venom. Being stung commonly results in excruciating pain, and if the sting area is significant, an untreated victim may die in two to five minutes.Biology, 7ed. Campell & Reece The amount of venom in one animal is said to be enough to kill 60 adult humans, Cnidaria Envenomation. eMedicine. Taxonomy Chironex fleckeri was named after North Queensland toxicologist and radiologist Doctor Hugo Flecker. \\"On January 20, 1955, when a 5-year-old boy died after being stung in shallow water at Cardwell, North Queensland, Flecker found three types of jellyfish. One was an unidentified box-shaped jellyfish with groups of tentacles arising from each corner. Flecker sent it to Dr Ronald Southcott in Adelaide, and on December 29, 1955, Southcott published his article introducing it as a new genus and species of lethal box jellyfish. He named it Chironex fleckeri, the name being derived from the Greek cheiro meaning \\"hand\\", the Latin nex meaning \\"murderer\\", and \\"fleckeri\\" in honour of its discoverer.\\"http://www.marine-medic.com.au/pages/medical/chironex.asp Description Cnidocytes from Chironex fleckeri (400x magnification) Chironex fleckeri is the largest of the cubozoans (collectively called box jellyfish), many of which may carry similarly toxic venom. Its bell grows to about the size of a basketball. From each of the four corners of the bell trails a cluster of 15 tentacles. The pale blue bell has faint markings; viewed from certain angles, it bears a somewhat eerie resemblance to a human head or skull. Since it is virtually transparent, the creature is nearly impossible to see in its habitat, posing particular danger to swimmers. When the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 15 cm long and about 5 mm in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m long. The tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. Box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor. In common with other box jellyfish, C. fleckeri has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. Some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. During a series of tests by marine biologists including Australian jellyfish expert Jamie Seymour, a single jellyfish was put in a tank. Then, two white poles were lowered into the tank. The creature appeared unable to see them and swam straight into them, thus knocking them over. Then, similar black poles were placed into the tank. This time, the jellyfish seemed aware of them, and swam around them in a figure-eight. Finally, to see if the specimen could see colour, a single red pole was stood in the tank. When the jellyfish apparently became aware of the object in its tank, it was seemingly repelled by it and remained at the far edge of the tank. Following these experiments, the Australian researchers put forward the idea of red safety nets for beaches (these nets are usually used to keep the jellyfish away, but many still get through its mesh). The test was repeated, with similar results, on Irukandji jellyfish, another toxic species of box jelly. Chironex fleckeri lives on a diet of prawns and small fish, and are prey to turtles, whose thick skin is impenetrable to the cnidocytes of the jellyfish. Distribution and habitat The medusa is pelagic and has been documented from coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea north to the Philippines and Vietnam. In Australia, it is known from the northern coasts from Exmouth to Agnes Water, but its full distribution outside Australia has not been properly identified. To further confuse, the closely related and also dangerously venomous Chironex yamaguchii was first described from Japan in 2009. This species has also been documented from the Philippines, meaning the non-Australian records of C. fleckeri need to be rechecked. Breeding occurs in lower levels of rivers and mangrove channels. Box jellyfish warning signpost at a Cape Tribulation beach in Queensland, Australia Sting Chironex fleckeri is best known for its extremely powerful and occasionally fatal \\"sting\\". The sting can produce an excruciating pain accompanied by an intense burning sensation, like being branded with a red hot iron. In Australia, fatalities are most often caused by the larger specimens of C. fleckeri. In Australia, C. fleckeri has caused at least 64 deaths since the first report in 1883,Northern Territory Government (2008). Department of Health and Families. Chironex fleckeri. . Centre for Disease Control. but most encounters appear to result only in mild envenomation.Daubert, G. P. (2008). Cnidaria Envenomation. eMedicine. Among 225 analyzed C. fleckeri stings in Australia's Top End from 1991 to 2004, only 8% required hospital admission, 5% received antivenom and there was a single fatality (a 3-year-old child). 26% experienced severe pain, while it was moderate to none in the remaining. Most deaths in recent decades have been children, as their smaller body mass puts them at a higher risk of fatal envenomation. When people do die, it is usually caused by a cardiac arrest occurring within minutes of the sting. Researchers at the University of Hawaii's Department of Tropical Medicine have found that the venom causes cells to become porous enough to allow potassium leakage, causing hyperkalemia which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death as quickly as within two to five minutes with an LD50 of 0.04 mg/kg, making it the most venomous jellyfish in the world (to laboratory mice). It was postulated that a zinc compound may be developed as an antidote.Box jelly venom under the microscope ‚Äì By Anna Salleh ‚Äì Australian Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äì Retrieved 2012-12-13. Occasionally, swimmers who get stung will undergo cardiac arrest or drown before they can even get back to the shore or boat. Chironex fleckeri and other jellyfish, including the Irukandji (Carukia barnesi), are abundant in the waters of northern Australia during the summer months (November to April or May). They are believed to drift into the aforementioned estuaries to breed. Signs like the one pictured are erected along the coast of North Queensland to warn people of such, and few people swim during this period. Some people still do, however, putting themselves at great risk. At popular swimming spots, net enclosures are placed out in the water wherein people can swim but jellyfish cannot get in, keeping swimmers safe.Queensland beaches stinger information page History of sting treatment Until 2005, treatment involved using pressure immobilisation bandages, with the aim of preventing distribution of the venom through the lymph and blood circulatory systems. This treatment is no longer recommended by health authorities,Queensland Government (2008). Pressure Immobilisation Technique Queensland Health due to research which showed that using bandages to achieve tissue compression provoked nematocyst discharge.Seymour et al. The use of pressure immobilization bandages in the first aid management of cubozoan envenomings Toxicon 2002 The application of vinegar is recommended treatment because vinegar (4‚Äì6% acetic acid) permanently deactivates undischarged nematocysts, preventing them from opening and releasing venom. A 2014 study demonstrated in vitro that while vinegar deactivates unfired nematocysts, there was also an increase in venom concentration in the solution, possibly by causing already- fired nematocysts (which still contain some venom) to release what remained. However, this study has been criticized on several methodological grounds, including that the experiment was done using a model membrane that is much different from (and more simple than) human skin. Also, the researchers did not determine whether the increase in venom concentration was caused by already-discharged nematocysts releasing more venom, or if the venom that was released initially had simply leaked back out through the membrane, thus confounding the concentration measurement. Despite these concerns, diluted acetic acid is still the recommended treatment.

Frazer and industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. In 1947, the company acquired the automotive assets of Graham-Paige, of which Frazer had become president near the end of World War II. Kaiser-Frazer was the only new US automaker to achieve success after World War II, if only for a few years. When Frazer left in 1951, the company renamed itself the Kaiser Motors Corporation and continued until 1955. History 1953 Kaiser Darrin sports car in 3D Anachrome. Body design by Dutch Darrin and Bill Tritt. The company was founded on July 25, 1945 and in 1946 K-F displayed prototypes of their two new cars at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. The Kaiser was of an advanced front wheel drive design while the Frazer was an upscale conventional rear wheel drive car. The production costs and the limited time available prevented the front wheel drive design from entering production, so the new 1947 Kaiser and Frazer shared bodies and powertrains. Being some of the first newly designed cars on the market while the \\"Big Three\\" were still marketing their pre-war designs, the Kaisers and Frazers made an exciting entrance. Kaiser and Frazer continued to share bodies and engines through 1950 with different exterior and interior trim. 1953 Kaiser Darrin in Anachrome 3D. Note that the doors slide into the front fender. Henry Kaiser had no automotive marketing experience; Joseph Frazer did, having held various positions with Packard, GM, Chrysler, and Willys-Overland. Kaiser believed in pressing forward in the face of adversity, while Frazer was more pragmatic. As the market for Kaiser-Frazer products slowed in 1949 with the introduction of new designs from the Big Three, Kaiser pushed for more production, creating an oversupply of cars that took until mid-1950 to sell. Kaiser and Frazer had repeated disagreements on how aggressive production should be until, finally, Joseph Frazer left the company in 1951 and the Frazer nameplate was dropped after a short 10,000 unit production run in 1951 that used up the remaining inventory of the 1949-50 bodies. Subsequent history In 1952, the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation was renamed Kaiser Motors Corporation and continued building passenger cars through 1955. In 1953, Kaiser bought the ailing Willys-Overland company for US$63,381,175 and merged the Kaiser and Willys operations under the name Kaiser-Willys Corporation. The decision was then made to exit the passenger car market, which was accomplished at the end of the 1955 model year. By 1956, Willys Motors built only utility vehicles, many for export, and was turning a healthy profit. In 1970, the Kaiser Jeep Corporation, as the company had been renamed in 1963, was sold to American Motors Corporation. Production Production of Kaiser-Frazer models was centered at Willow Run, Michigan. Willow Run, the largest building in the world at that time, was built by the U.S. government just prior to World War II for Henry Ford to build B-24 Liberator bombers. Once the war ended, Ford had no interest in the facility, and the War Assets Administration began a search for someone to lease or buy the building. When K-F expressed interest in the facility, the WAA offered them an attractive five-year lease rate. K-F also had manufacturing facilities in Jefferson MI; Long Beach CA; Portland OR; Leaside, Ontario, Canada; Haifa, Israel; Kawasaki, Japan;\\"U.S. Cars Roll Off Tokyo Assembly Lines.\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1952, p. 164, bottom of page. Mexico City and Rotterdam (known as \\"Nekaf\\", for Nederlandse Kaiser-Frazer fabrieken). U.S. production was concentrated at Toledo, Ohio, upon the purchase of Willys-Overland starting in 1953; the Willow Run facility was sold to General Motors after GM suffered a disastrous fire at their Livonia, Michigan, Hydramatic automatic transmission plant and needed a facility quickly to resume production.

In 1951, Argentina sent their emissary, Brigadier General Juan Ignacio San Mart√≠n, to the US to convince an auto manufacturer to build cars in Argentina. In 1954, Kaiser was the only one to accept the offer, with the remainder believing the market was too small to justify the investment. Also, they did not have the rugged products Kaiser did. On January 19, 1955, Kaiser and the government of Argentina signed an agreement to permit Kaiser to manufacture automobiles and trucks in Argentina. In February, Kaiser created a wholly owned subsidiary named Kaiser Automotores, the holding company which in turn owned part of the newly created Industrias Kaiser Argentina S.A. (IKA), the manufacturing and marketing arm. Other partners in IKA included the government-owned vehicle manufacturer Industrias Aeron√°uticas y Mec√°nicas del Estado (IAME) and private investors. In August, Kaiser applied for and received an import license to bring in 1,021 completed cars, manufacturing equipment and spare parts from the US. Groundbreaking for the new factory was in March 1955 with the first Jeep vehicle rolling out of the plant on 27 April 1956. Diagram of Carabela's measurements. The new Argentine factory was built in the city of Santa Isabel in the province of C√≥rdoba with the Kaiser Manhattan being rechristened the \\"Kaiser Carabela\\" ‚Äî named after a type of Portuguese sailing ship. The US vinyl and fabric interior was replaced with a more rugged leather interior, the speedometer was recalibrated in kilometers with the temperature, oil, and fuel gauge annotations in Spanish and the spring rates were increased to accommodate unimproved Argentine roads. Oddly, the dash castings with annotations for vent, heater, headlight and wiper controls remained in English. No consideration was given to offering an automatic transmission due to the anticipated difficulty in obtaining service in remote towns. Production started on the Carabela on 25 July 1958 and, in the remaining months of that year, 2,158 cars were built. IKA was also building Jeep vehicles at the Cordoba factory and assembled 20,454 Jeeps in 1958 alone. The combined Carabela-Jeep production of 22,612 units was 81% of all vehicles manufactured in Argentina in 1958 with the only competition being the state-run utility vehicle manufacturer IAME. Many have questioned the wisdom of building IKA automobile factory in remote Santa Isabel which was far from ports and transportation hubs but the primary reason is that C√≥rdoba was General San Mart√≠n's home province and he had a close, influential relationship with President Juan Per√≥n. In 1962, the Carabela, the \\"Gran coche argentino\\" (the Great Argentine Car), ended production with some 15,000 cars assembled providing elegant transportation for the doctors, bankers and other notables in Argentina. The Carabela had some stable mates in 1960-62 in the form of an Alfa Romeo 1900 sedan derivative named the Bergantin (another type of Spanish sailing ship) and an Argentine-manufactured Renault Dauphine (badged IKA Dauphine). In 1962, Rambler variants licensed from AMC would replace all of these. The final form of the AMC variants was the potent Torino which saw a lot of racing on international circuits. Built until the early 1980s, the Torino was based on the 1964 Rambler American 2-door hardtop and 4-door sedan, but had its own engine, front and rear end styling, and a more European-styled interior. In 1970, Kaiser sold IKA to Renault. Kaiser in Israel With the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, the Ford Motor Company sought to invest in the new state, and to facilitate the production of a large number of vehicles Israel would need for the military and the government. Ford announced plans to build an assembly plant in Israel. When Arab nations got word of Ford‚Äôs plans, they announced that if Ford didn't cancel the agreement, they‚Äôd boycott it by putting the company on the Arab League‚Äôs blacklist. Ford pulled out causing a moment of crisis for the Israeli government. While the government was searching for alternatives, Lord Marcus Sieff of London, contacted Efraim Ilin, an Israeli security expert and tycoon, and put him in contact with Hickman Price of Kaiser-Frazer. The company had recently built an automobile plant in Holland, and were planning to build one in Greece. Ilin met Price and negotiated a $2.5 million project. Kaiser-Frazer invested half a million dollars, and Ilin formed a group that invested the other two million dollars. Kaiser production began in Israel in 1951. By 1956, Kaiser-Frazer was responsible for 28% of Israeli exports. The factory built Kaiser-Frazer products, along with Mack trucks, under license. By the end of the 1950s, the operation was known as Kaiser-Ilin, named after Efraim Ilin, the Israeli entrepreneur who had negotiated the Haifa plant deal with Hickman Price Jr., the nephew of Joseph P. Frazer. In 1959, Kaiser-Ilin reached an agreement to assemble six-cylinder Studebaker Larks in Haifa, to help potential buyers bypass stiff Israeli duties on imported vehicles. Earlier that year, the Kaiser-Frazer plant at Haifa laid off 400 workers and suspended operations for two weeks because of a lack of parts.http://www.jta.org/1959/12/02/archive/kaiser-frazer-plant-in-israel- suspends-operations-for-two-weeks#ixzz3Ex2QNHge Kaiser Frazer in the Netherlands  In 1947, the Dutch company Nederlandse Kaiser-Frazer Fabrieken (NEKAF) was created with a new factory constructed in Rotterdam. NEKAF assembled 6,000 1949 Kaiser knock-down kits imported from the US using some local content (batteries, tires, interior, carpets, glass) and ignition and electrical system parts from France and Great Britain. Kaiser cars were assembled through 1954 with NEKAF exporting to Europe, South America and the Middle East. US-built Jeep vehicles were imported into The Netherlands by S.A. Ateliers de La Dyle under an agreement with Willys Overland. Once Willys was purchased by Kaiser, the Willys agreement was transferred to NEKAF. In March 1954, assembly of the Jeep CJ-3B started and was followed by the FC-150, FC-170, the pickup truck, station wagon, CJ-5 and DJ-3A. On 21 January 1955, NEKAF signed a contract with the Royal Netherlands Army to supply 4,000 M38A1 jeeps with the first delivery to the army on 28 May of the same year. The vehicles were knock down kits imported from the US with some local content as with the 1949 Kaiser assembly. NEKAF delivered an additional 1,624 vehicles to the army through 1959 until production was taken over by Kemper & Van Twist Diesel who delivered another 2,237 jeep vehicles through 1963 although these were still commonly known as NEKAFs. The NEKAF jeeps differed from the US version by adding side reflectors (white in front and red at the rear), low intensity \\"city lights\\" on the front fenders and front and rear mounted directional signals. In a bid to reduce the costs, the Ministry of War, having invested already in clothing for the crews, ordered the cabin heaters to be deleted. This modification entailed considerable redesign of the engine cooling unit which eventually led to increased cost of the vehicles (some 12,000 Dutch guilders each). The jeeps, dubbed NEKAF by the military, started to enter service in 1956 and remained so well into the 1990s albeit on reservist duties. The NEKAF jeep saw action in the brief Dutch Indonesian war in 1962, but particularly during the UNIFIL operation in which an armoured infantry battalion participated from 1979 till 1983, the NEKAF turned out to be a robust and reliable vehicle in South Lebanon. Upon withdrawal of the Dutch battalion all UNIFIL NEKAFs were dismantled and sold locally as scrap, save three NEKAFs that were secretly withheld and privately driven back to the Netherlands. One of these sole surviving UNIFIL NEKAFs is now in the collection of the Legermuseum Delft (the Dutch Army Museum).

British Woodland Trees, p.26. 3rd. edition. London: B. T. Batsford Ltd. The species was first identified, as Ulmus laevis, by Pallas, in his Flora Rossica published in 1784.Pallas, P. S. (1784). Flora Rossica. i.75, t.48, f.F. The tree is allogamous and is most closely related to the American elm U. americana. Endemic to alluvial forest, U. laevis is rarely encountered at elevations above 400 m.Girard, S. (2007). Dossier: L'orme: nouveaux espoirs? For√™t entreprise No. 175, Juillet 2007, Institut pour le developpement forestier, Paris. Most commonly found along rivers such as the Volga and Danube, it is one of very few elms tolerant of prolonged waterlogged, anoxic ground conditions. The species is threatened by habitat destruction and disturbance in some countries, notably Spain. Flood control schemes are particularly harmful, as seed dispersion is reliant on floods, while abstraction from aquifers lowering ground water levels has compromised the development of the trees. Although not possessed of an innate genetic resistance to Dutch elm disease, the species is rarely infected in western Europe. Description Ulmus laevis is similar in stature to the wych elm, if rather less symmetric, with a looser, untidy, branch structure and less neatly rounded crown. The tree typically reaches a height and breadth of > 30 m, with a trunk < 2 m d.b.h. The extensive shallow root system ultimately forms distinctive high buttresses around the base of the trunk. The bark is smooth at first, then in early maturity breaks into thin grey scales, which separate with age into a network of grey-brown scales and reddish-brown underbark, and finally is deeply fissured in old age like other elms.Elwes & Henry (1913), Mitchell (1974), Phillips (1978), Bean (1981). The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple ovate with a markedly asymmetric base, < 10 cm long and < 7 cm broad, comparatively thin, often almost papery in texture and very translucent, smooth above with a downy underside. Significantly, the leaf veins do not divide from the central vein to the leaf margin. The leaves are shed earlier in autumn than other species of European elm. The tree is most reliably distinguished from other European elms by its long flower stems, averaging 20 mm. Moreover, the apetalous wind-pollinated flowers are distinctively cream-coloured, appearing before the leaves in early spring in clusters of 15-30; they are 3‚Äì4 mm across. The fruit is a winged samara < 15 mm long by 10 mm broad with a ciliate margin, the single round 5 mm seed maturing in late spring. The seeds have a generally high rate of germination, 45‚Äì60% for Serbian trees examined by Stilinoviƒá.Stilinoviƒá, S. (1985): Semenarstvo ≈°umskog i ukrasnog drveƒáa i ≈æbunja.

H. (2020). Disease-resistant elm cultivars. Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, England. The species differs from its closest relative, the American elm, mainly in the irregular crown structure and frequent epicormic shoots, features which also give the tree a distinctive winter silhouette. Republished 2004 Cambridge University Press, Bean, W. J. (1981). Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 7th edition. Murray, London. The American elm also has less acute leaf buds, longer petioles, narrower leaves, and a deeper apical notch in the samara which reaches the seed.Chater, A. O.

(2005). Screening European Elms for Resistance to Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. Forest Science, 134‚Äì141. 51 (2) 2005. Society of American Foresters. Moreover, the tree is not favoured by the vector bark beetles, which colonize it only when there are no other elm alternatives available,Collin, E., Bilger, I., Eriksson, G., & Turok, J. (2000). The conservation of elm genetic resources in Europe. In Dunn, C. P. (Ed.) (2000). The elms: breeding, conservation & disease management. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston. an uncommon situation in western Europe. Indeed, in a study of elm in Flanders, not one example of U. laevis was found to be afflicted by Dutch elm disease.Vander Mijnsbrugge, K., Vanden Broeck, A., & Van Slycken, J. (2005). A study of Ulmus laevis in Flanders (Northern Belgium). Belgian Journal of Botany, Vol. 138, No. 2 (2005), 199‚Äì204. Royal Botanical Society of Belgium. Research in Spain has indicated that it is the presence of an antifeedant triterpene, alnulin, at a concentration of 200 Œºg/g {dried bark} which renders the tree unattractive to the beetles. Ergo: the tree's decline in western Europe is chiefly owing to woodland clearance in river valleys, and river management systems eliminating flooding, not disease. It was noted by Jouin at Metz, and a century later by Mittempergher and Santini in Italy, that U. laevis had a very low susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola. Research in Germany has established that the tree is also eschewed by the Zig Zag sawfly Aproceros leucopoda. Elwes observed that trees planted at Ugbrooke in Devon were infested with Cacopsylla ulmi,Jeriniƒá-Prodanoviƒá, D. (2006).

H. (1983). Elm. p.64. Cambridge University Press. The species has a slight to moderate susceptibility to elm yellows. Cultivation U. laevis is essentially a riparian tree, able to withstand over 100 days of continual flooding,Spohn, M. (2008). Trees of Britain & Europe (Black's Nature Guides), 256 p. A & C Black, although it is intolerant of saline conditions Spanish trees were found to be calcifuge, preferring slightly acid, siliceous soils, and also drought-intolerant, their xylem vessels prone to drought-stress cavitation.Venturas, M. et al.

In England, the tree failed to prosper in chalk stream valleys, where the soil was predominantly black peat, named 'Adventurers' for the Adventurers' Land SSSI in Cambridgeshire, owing to dehydration in summer. Trees planted in dry ground are notoriously short-lived. Pokorny, J. (1974). Colour Guide to Familiar Trees, Leaves, Bark and Fruit. Octopus, Czechoslovakia. U. laevis is comparatively weak-wooded, much more so than field elm Ulmus minor, and thus an inappropriate choice for exposed locations. In trials in southern England by Butterfly Conservation, young trees of <5 m height were badly damaged by wind gusts of 40 knots (75 km/h) in midsummer storms. The species was never widely introduced to the United States, but is represented at several arboreta. Ulmus effusa, supplied by the Sp√§th nursery of Berlin, was planted at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada, in 1896,Ulmus effusa at Ottawa, from Sp√§th; New York Botanical Garden herbarium specimen 02465976, vplants.org as U. pedunculata. In the Far East, the tree has been planted in Xinjiang province and elsewhere in northern China; planting in Tongliao City is known to have been particularly successful. White elm is also known to have been introduced to Australia.Spencer, R., Hawker, J. and Lumley, P. (1991). Elms in Australia, Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, Australia. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the tree has enjoyed a small renaissance in England. A popular larval host plant of the white-letter hairstreak Satyrium w-album butterfly across Europe, the elm is now being planted by Butterfly Conservation and other groups to restore local populations decimated by the effects of Dutch elm disease on native or archaeophytic elms. The Cheshire Wildlife Trust, for example, planted numerous white elms on its reserves in the former Vale Royal district of the county.

(1807). The Gardener's and Botanist's Dictionary. Revised by Thomas Martyn, Regius Professor of Botany, University of Cambridge. The first specimen to be reported in cultivation, in 1838, was at Whiteknights Park, Reading, which featured an elm grove;Hofland, Mrs. (1819). A descriptive account of the mansion and gardens of White- Knights: a seat of His Grace the Duke of Marlborough Private publication, London.. the tree measured in height, suggesting it had been planted at the end of the 18th century. However, the authenticity of the Whiteknights tree is a matter of contention; it flowered but did not set fertile seed, which suggested to Loudon that it might be U. campestris (U. minor 'Atinia'), or, on account of it not producing suckers, possibly U. montana (:U. glabra). Moreover, Whiteknights was supplied by the Lee and Kennedy nursery of Hammersmith, which is not known to have stocked U. laevis. A tree at Syon Park identified by Elwes & Henry as U. laevis was later considered by Bean as more closely resembling U. americana by dint of its symmetrical branch arching. The species was not reported from the wild until 1943, with the discovery of a tree in a Surrey hedgerow.Online Atlas of the British & Irish Flora It is possible the tree's distribution was associated with Capability Brown (1716‚Äì1783), known to have favoured U. laevis, which he listed among his preferred \\"native\\" (sic) trees.Ignatieva, M. E. and Stewart, G. H. 'Homogeneity of urban biotopes and similarity of landscape design language in former colonial cities', in: McDonnell, M., Hahs, A., & Breuste, J. (eds.) (2009).

This could explain the existence of the seven old specimens discovered by Elwes in 1908 on Mount Pleasant within Ugbrooke Park, Devon, designed by Brown in 1761.Stroud, D. (1950). Capability Brown. New edition 1984, Faber & Faber, London. Ugbrooke is four miles from Mamhead Park, which had earlier been planted with numerous exotic trees, notably holm oak, collected by its owner, merchant Thomas Ball ( d. 1749) during his commercial travels in Europe.Britton, J. & Brayley, E. W. (1803). Beauties of England & Wales. Vol. 4, Devon & Cornwall, Devonshire, p 99\\\\. Various publishers. Ball's introductions were known to have been marketed by his head gardener William Lucombe, who in 1720 founded the first commercial nursery in the south-west at Exeter,Harvey, J. (1975). Early Nurserymen. Phillimore, Chichester, UK. though an account of trees growing at Mamhead by Pince (grandson of Lucombe) in 1835 makes no mention of U. laevis nor of any other elms. None of Lucombe's early catalogues are known to survive, and thus the introduction of U. laevis through south Devon cannot be confirmed. However, the tree does not feature in any of the surviving arboreta accessions lists, or catalogues of the larger, nationally famous, nurseries of the day, and its earliest-known mention in commerce remains in the south-west, in the catalogue of the Ford & Please nursery (as U. pedunculata) at Exeter circa 1836. James Main mentions the tree as 'a native of Hungary' and in 1838 only to be met in 'ornamental plantations', but by 1846 was 'becoming available in (UK) nurseries'. U. laevis, obtained from the Sp√§th nursery of Berlin as U. effusa, was planted in Kew Gardens (1895), in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk (1914),rystonhall.co.uk/ and, re-propagated, in Cambridge University Botanic Garden (1909). Evidently the tree did not gain in popularity, and was overlooked or ignored by most authors of popular guides to trees in Britain during the 20th century, notably Mabey in his Flora Britannica.Books on trees in Britain in the 20th century: Trimble, L. J. F. (1946) Trees in Britain, Macmillan, London. Step, E. (1904). Wayside And Woodland Trees. A Pocket Guide To The British Sylva. Frederick Warne & Co., London. Gurney, R. (1958). Trees of Britain. Faber & Faber, London. Mabey, R. (1998) Flora Britannica. Chatto & Windus, London. The tree is also omitted from Keble-Martin's comprehensive Flora of Devon.Keble-Martin, W., and Fraser, G. (1939). Flora of Devon. Buncle, Arbroath. It is not known whether U. laevis was introduced to Scotland before the early 20th century. Two of the three specimens supplied by the Sp√§th nursery, Berlin, to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. effusa may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the garden to distribute trees about the city; the third specimen was in the garden itself.Tree C2711, RBGE Cultivated herbarium accession book, 1958 Melville annotations Other examples can be found in the city, notably in Fettes College grounds opposite Inverleith Allotments, and at the entrance to North Merchiston Cemetery.U. laevis in Edinburgh: East Fettes Avenue , North Merchiston Cemetery , Leith Links . In Wales, two mature trees with numerous suckers occur in a small wood at Rhydyfelin near Aberystwyth,Watsonia (2001). p557 while another grows at Llandegfan, Anglesey. In Ireland, the tree is represented by a line of four at the Old Rectory, Kells Road, Ardee, County Louth (, girth , October 2009),Tree Register of Ireland (Tree Council of Ireland) and in the Channel Islands, by a clump near the well at La Seigneurie (Le Manoir), Sark.

Other veterans survive at Casteau, Belgium (bole-girth 5.15 m), in Rahnsdorf near Berlin (bole-girth 4.5 m)Rahnsdorf_Ulme.html and in Ritvala, Finland (bole-girth 4.49 m). A lane of Ulmus laevis is found at Eibergen, Netherlands (see Gallery below), while a large, mature specimen is found within the Alhambra, Granada. Ulmus laevis has very occasionally been planted as an ornamental tree in the UK, and even more randomly in countryside hedgerows. The UK Champion is at Ferry Farm, on the banks of the Tamar at Harewood, Cornwall (27 m high, 1.8 m d.b.h. in 1997).

The density of the timber is significantly lower than that of other European elms. However, owing to its rapid growth, tolerance of soil compaction, air pollution and de- icing salts, the tree has long been used for amenity planting in towns and along roadsides.Collin, E. (2003). EUFORGEN Technical Guidelines for genetic conservation and use for European white elm (Ulmus laevis). IPGRI, Rome, Italy. Propagation U. laevis is easily grown from seed sown on ordinary compost and kept well-watered. However, viability can vary greatly from year to year, while the seed is remarkably short-lived. Germination should occur within one week even without heat, the best seedlings attaining as much as half a metre in their first year.Harris, E. (2017). The European White Elm, Ulmus laevis Pall. Quarterly Journal of Forestry, Vol. 111, No. 4, October 2017. p.261. Royal Forestry Society. Softwood cuttings taken in June is also a reliable method; the cuttings strike very quickly, well within a fortnight, rapidly producing a dense matrix of roots. Image:Ulmus laevis seedlings.jpgU. laevis seedlings Image:White Elm rooted cutting.jpgA rooted cutting of European white elm Subspecies and varieties Several putative varieties have been identified. A variety celtidea from what is now the Ukraine was reported by Rogowicz in the middle of the 19th century, but no examples are known to survive. Another variety parvifolia has been reported from Serbia.Jovanoviƒá, B. & Raduloviƒá, S. (1980). Ulmus laevis var. parvifolia. Glasn. Prir. Muz. u Beogradu. (Bulletin of the Natural History Museum, Belgrade). 35 : 32, 38 (1980). Belgrade, Serbia. 'Simplicidens' is a very rare variety, the only example known to survive is at the National Botanic Garden of Latvia in Salaspils. Cultivars Compared with the other European species of elm, U. laevis has received scant horticultural attention, there being only eight recorded cultivars: In Russia other ornamental forms are recognized: f. argentovariegata, f. rubra, and f. tiliifolia. A pyramidal form was reported in 1888 from the Fredericksfelde cemetery in Berlin by Bolle. A line of similar monopodial trees grows (2019) on the island in the Lot at Entraygues, France. File:Barjols2013 007.jpgColumnar form, Entraygues, France Hybrids U. laevis does not hybridize naturally, in common with the American elm (U. americana) to which it is closely related. However, in experiments at the Arnold Arboretum, it was successfully crossed with U. thomasii and U. pumila; no such crosses have ever been released to commerce.

Glevum (or, more formally, Colonia Nervia Glevensium, or occasionally Glouvia) was originally a Roman fort in Roman Britain that became a \\"colonia\\" of retired legionaries in AD 97. Today, it is known as Gloucester, located in the English county of Gloucestershire. The name Glevum is taken by many present-day businesses in the area and also by the 26-mile Glevum Way,Glevum Way Summary - the Long Distance Walkers Association a long-distance footpath or recreational walk encircling modern Gloucester. Fortress Glevum was established around AD 48, at an important crossing of the River Severn, and near to the Fosse Way, the early front line after the Roman invasion of Britain. Initially, a Roman fort was established at present-day Kingsholm. Twenty years later, a larger replacement fortress was built on slightly higher ground nearby, centred on present-day Gloucester Cross, and a civilian settlement grew around it. The Roman Legions based here were probably the Legio XX Valeria Victrix until 66 and then Legio II AugustaG Webster, Rome against Caractacus, p 45, ISBN0731472537 for their invasion of Roman Wales between 66 and 74 AD. The colonia of Glevum Colonia In AD 97, the city was designated a colonia by the Emperor Nerva. A colonia was the residence of retired legionaries and enjoyed the highest status of city in the Empire. The legionaries were given farmland in the surrounding district, and could be called upon as a Roman auxiliary armed force. The city was built within the legionary fortress and used the same rectilinear street plan and ramparts.J. Wacher, The Towns of Roman Britain, ISBN: 9780415170413 p 137- A large and impressive administrative basilica and forum market-place were built in the town, as well as many fine homes with mosaic floors. At its height, Glevum may have had a population of as many as 10,000 people. The entire area around Glevum was intensely Romanised in the second and third centuries, with a higher than normal distribution of villas, as a result of its suitability for the traditional intensive Roman farming methods. Today, some of the best examples of Roman villas in Britain, including Chedworth villa and Woodchester villa, both famous for their Roman mosaics, are not far from Glevum. Decline Excavations at Gloucester's New Market Hall in the 1960s showed that Romano-British occupation of the town may have continued in some form into the sub-Roman period, even if the town's population may have been greatly reduced. A new portal in the town's wall was built at the beginning of the sixth century, showing a modest growth of the town after the Battle of Mons Badonicus in 497. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records a King Coinmail (according to the original A-text), who may have come from Gloucester, taking part in the Battle of Dyrham in 577, when the city was conquered by the Anglo-Saxons. Remains right *Many archaeological artifacts and some in situ walls from Roman Glevum may be seen in the Gloucester City Museum & Art Gallery *The remains of the Roman and medieval East Gate are on display in the East Gate Chamber on Eastgate Street. *There was a small display in the former Royal Bank of Scotland premises on the Roman finds found from the site, but the branch has now closed and the building is currently empty. *Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate Streets all follow the line of their original Roman counterparts, although Westgate Street has moved slightly north and Southgate Street now extends through the site of the Roman basilica. *An equestrian statue of the Emperor Nerva was erected at the entrance to Southgate Street in 2002. It was created by Anthony Stone and paid for by public subscription, following a campaign that started in 1997, the 1900th anniversary of the colonia's foundation.

History Founded as a countermeasure against the growing power of the military in Peru during the first half of the Republic, the party's sole purpose was to establish a civilian rule in the country. This, however, did not prevent them from creating political alliances with the military during its first years of existence. Founded in 1872, the party's first candidate was its founder, Manuel Pardo, who was elected on August 2, 1872. During the 1870s, economic growth and a certain degree of political stability had laid the conditions for creating the country's first political party. It was also a new era of international trade, business, and finance that Peru was benefiting from. Some believed that this era required the managerial skills that an educated and professional Elite could provide and believed Manuel Pardo was apt for this job. The Civilista Party was first primarily composed of the newly rich merchants, planters, and businesspeople in Peru (especially those who benefited themselves with the Guano Boom exportations). The members of the party believed that the military was corrupt and no longer capable of ruling the country and that it was more apt to serve it militarily than to rule it politically. After the War of the Pacific and a successful revolution (that removed the military from power once again), the Party played a key role in the reconstruction of the country. Reviving its antimilitary and pro-export program, they secured the support of its constituents. Most of its members were part of the economic and social elite established in Lima. Between 1899 and 1920, most Peruvian presidents had been members of this Party. This period of Peruvian history is often called the Aristocratic Republic (coined by Peruvians referring to the social elite that governed them). Elections, however, were restricted, subject to strict property and literacy qualifications, and more often than not manipulated by the incumbent Civilista regime. The party, as a major political force, was disbanded during the so- called oncenio (11 years of power) of Augusto B. Legu√≠a y Salcedo's second term.

No ships were lost on either side, and casualties were small. History Elphinston had arrived at Cape Matapan, southern Greece, on 20 May 1770 from Portsmouth and landed his troops on 22 May at Rupino. Hearing that the Ottoman fleet was divided in two, he decided to attack. After battling bad weather, he sighted the Ottoman ships on 27 May at the entrance to the gulf and despite the superior numbers of the Ottomans (about 10 battleships and some smaller vessels vs 3 battleships, 2 frigates and 4 armed merchantmen) he sailed up before a light SSE breeze to attack. Soon after 5pm Ne tron menya attacked the Ottoman flagship, and then Saratov attacked the Ottoman Vice- and Rear Admiral's ships. Nadezhda was also in action. Elphinston, in Svyatoslav, had to chase and fire on the armed merchantmen to get them to fight, but when he did attack the Ottoman fleet retreated, using their galleys to tow their battleships north. The Russians used their boats to do the same. On 28 May, soon after 12pm the Ottoman fleet anchored in line under the guns of the Nauplia batteries. At about 3pm Elphinston attacked, standing up and down the Ottoman line, but with little effect. Russian casualties were low. On 30 May, the Ottomans began to move, and some Russian captains insisted that they were not bound to attack such a superior fleet. Elphinston had to give in, and during the evening of 31 May as the Ottomans steadily approached, being towed again by their galleys, the wind rose and the Russians got away.

Named by the New York Times as one of the 5 best voices on the planet. Biography Valeria Lynch was born on January 7, 1952 in the neighborhood of Villa Urquiza, Buenos Aires, Argentina, the first child of the marriage of Mar√≠a Antonia Spano (Tony) and Jos√© Julio Lancellotti.> At age 14 while studying at the Commercial College Donato √Ålvarez in the neighborhood of La Paternal, she defined her vocation and began to study singing with Clara Calvo and drama with Dante Gilardoni. In 1969, she debuted on the television show La Botica del √Ångel with Eduardo Bergara Leumann, singing \\"Cuando un amigo se va\\". The first major production Lynch took, was with producer Alejandro Romay in the adaptation of the musical Hair, held at the Teatro Argentino in 1971 where she put her voice to the song Aquarius-Let The Sunshine In. From this Romay allegedly discovered her talent and suggested that she use a pseudonym. Valeria Lynch formally began performing in the 1970s singing jingles and underground rock in English with a group called Expression. She was also part of the TV TRIBU SRL, with which she recorded two songs for the soundtrack of the program, \\"I Am A Woman\\" and \\"Do Not Be Discouraged\\" as well as two different versions of the song\\" Tribu SRL \\"with the rest of the group, in 1975. In 1976 she married H√©ctor Cavallero, who had discovered her around 1974 when she was singing in the underground clubs of Buenos Aires. The story goes that Cavallero saw her sing and was so fascinated that he waited in the dressing room and offered to represent her and launch her career as a romantic singer. The couple had two sons, Federico (born 1979) and Santiago Cavallero (born 1986). After eighteen years together, they separated in 1995. Debut and first steps in the music industry In 1977 she released her first album, Valeria Lynch, and the cover was a drawing of her profile made by her friend Horacio Fontova. Her version of the song Mujer Sola, written by the Italian Mia Martini (Domenica Bert√©), was the first cut of circulation. Her debut as a pop balladeer was at the nightclub Michelangelo in the barrio of San Telmo. In April 1979, she released the album Mujer and made her first promotional trip to Mexico and Central America. 1980s During the 1980s, Valeria Lynch's success spread throughout Latin America. Her visceral singing style, coupled with her strong vocals and the choice of a repertoire that reached for popular taste made the difference with other interpreters of pop ballads. Her songs were not only a success in U.S. and Latin America but their music came to Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, Romania, Italy and the former Soviet Union. In 1980, while performing the musical \\"Estan tocando nuestra cancion\\" with Victor Laplace and Cipe Lincovsky in Buenos Aires, she released her third studio album Capricornio. The song Somos Locos del Amor was a favorite of the Argentine public. In 1981, Valeria was in Mexico on a promotional tour and people from her record company suggested she audition for the rock opera Evita, directed by Harold Prince. Mexican producers had chosen the Mexican Roc√≠o Banquels, but Harold Prince was overwhelming in his statement that \\"in my music I want Valeria,\\" so it was decided that the two were the protagonists. Playing the role of Eva Per√≥n opened the doors to the international level. In repeated statements to the press Harold Prince said: \\"Valeria Lynch was the best that I got to direct as Evita\\". In 1982 she released Quiereme, the hit single Mentira, song composed by Chilean Buddy Richard and international success of the Nicaraguan Hernaldo Z√∫√±iga, catapulted her to stardom and the album was promoted throughout the continent. This production won a Grammy Award nomination in the category \\"Best Latin Album\\" thanks to the orchestrations included, marking the first time the award was extended to Spanish-language recordings. On this album, the song \\"Esto llamado amor\\" involved renowned American singer Jeffrey Osborne, former lead singer of music group \\"LTD\\". In 1983 the album Un poco mas de mi, also known as Contigo soy capaz de todo in some countries, was released. The song Amiga Mia, which had been recorded a year before by the Venezuelan singer Miriam Ochoa without commercial success, became a big hit as Valeria's rendition. In 1984 she signed with RCA Ariola, and started her most successful career point, selling millions of her various recordings. 1985 was the year of the launch of the album Para Cantarle a la vida (To sing to life), with the singles Se√±or amante, Querido Mio, Que mal elegiste, tu eres el hombre Yo sin el and como una loba making this album one of the best sellers in the entire region. Such was the success that in Buenos Aires, she drew nearly 100,000 spectators in 53 shows with their concert at the Teatro Astros. Also in 1985 she was invited to participate in the International Festival of Popular Song at Yamaha Budokan hall in Tokyo, Japan. Singing before more than 15,000 people she won the award for Best Performer of the Festival and the Grand Jury Prize, with the song Rompecabezas (Puzzle) that allowed her to overtake the competition La Toya Jackson. Japanese jury chairman Genichi Kawakami said that he chose Lynch for her technique of interpretation, her movement on stage and her mastery of the microphone and said the jury's verdict coincided with the vote of the audience, Valeria getting 91% of votes. That year she was also invited to perform at the Festival de Benidorm, made in Spain. In 1986, she published Sin Fronteras with the singles Amame en C√°mara Lenta, Fuera de mi Vida and Mu√±eca Rota, which went multi-platinum in different countries; the song Y tu no estas was covered by the legendary Cuban singer La Lupe, giving the lyrics of the song a religious twist and was adopted by the Protestant communities of Latin America, being popular to date.

The park itself is in area. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is immediately to the west of the park. Wimbledon Park is not part of Wimbledon Common, which is situated further to the west up the hill.  Early history  The original park comprised part of the grounds of Wimbledon manor house, the seat of the manor of Wimbledon, situated on the hill to the south, near St Mary's Church, Wimbledon the old parish church of Wimbledon. A series of owners enlarged the park northwards and eastwards. By the 19th century it was at its largest extent, and one of the homes of the Earls Spencer, lords of the manor. The park had been landscaped in the 18th century by Capability Brown when the lake was formed by constructing a dam across a brook that flows from the springline near Wimbledon Common down to the River Wandle in Earlsfield. In 1846, the 4th Earl Spencer sold the estate and house to John Augustus Beaumont a property developer who laid out new roads and sold plots of land for house building. Two roads still bear his name today ‚Äì Augustus Road and Beaumont Road. Development of the area was slow at first, but continued throughout the second half of the 19th century, gradually nibbling away at the parkland.  20th century onward  The modern park was purchased by the Borough of Wimbledon just before the First World War and is, with its ornamental lake, the grounds of the Wimbledon Club and Wimbledon Golf Course, the only remnant of the former, larger park. Late in the 20th century the London Borough of Merton sold on the Golf Course to the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, leaving just the public park and the lake in its ownership. Along the park's northern edge lies Horse Close wood, a small patch of old planted woodland, largely consisting of Ash and Oak. Wimbledon Park was added to the English Heritage (now Historic England) register of historic parks and gardens in 1987. A new children's water play area was opened in 2007, named the Elisabeth Pool in memory of a local child. The London Underground District line runs to the east of the Park between Southfields tube station and Wimbledon Park station. Wimbledon Park is home to a wide range of leisure facilities including tennis courts, a bowls pavilion, beach volleyball court and an outdoor and Watersports centre which offer a huge range of activities such as Sailing, Kayaking and Canoeing on the large lake which is park of the park. The park also contains an athletics stadium with 400m track. Every November a large fireworks display takes place in Wimbledon Park, organised by Merton Council it is one of the largest and most popular shows in London.

It is located on the Big Bay de Noc of Lake Michigan, between Snail Shell Harbor and Sand Bay, on the southern side of the Upper Peninsula, about 17 miles south of US 2. Fayette was the site of an industrial community that manufactured charcoal pig iron between 1867 and 1891. The town has been reconstructed into a living museum, showing what life was like in this town in the late 19th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History Fayette was once one of the Upper Peninsula's most productive iron-smelting operations. Fayette grew up around two blast furnaces, a large dock, and several charcoal kilns, following the post-Civil War need for iron. Nearly 500 residents‚Äîmany immigrating from Canada, the British Isles, and northern Europe‚Äîlived in and near the town that existed to make pig iron. During 24 years of operation Fayette's blast furnaces produced a total of 229,288 tons of iron, using local hardwood forests for fuel and quarrying limestone from the bluffs to purify the iron ore. When the charcoal iron market began to decline, the Jackson Iron Company closed its Fayette smelting operations in 1891. Another event leading to the demise of the Jackson Iron Company was the use of the hardwoods and limestone to purify the iron, leading to the exhaustion of hardwoods in the area. This was the main source for purifying the iron and therefore led to the decline of the Jackson Iron Company. After shutting down operations, many residents left Fayette in search of employment elsewhere, though some chose to stay nearby and used the land for farming. Because of the closing of smelting operations, the town became a resort and fishing village. In 1916 it was purchased by a wealthy individual and turned into a summer resort. It continued in that capacity until 1946 when another individual purchased it, who eventually fell behind on taxes. Lastly, it was purchased by the Escanaba Paper Company, and was swapped to the Michigan government for timberland. As a result, Fayette became a state park in 1959. Fayette Historic Townsite Today, Fayette Historic Townsite is a living museum with many restored buildings. Visitors may walk through the buildings to learn about life in Fayette during the late 19th century. Over 20 buildings are open, with restoration continuing on other parts of the town. The townsite is open daily for visitors from approx. May through October. A visitors center and museum store are also located at the park. There is no admission charge; however, a Michigan State Park permit is required. For more information consult the State of Michigan Fayette page. Camping There are 61 semi-modern campsites . Facilities include electrical service to all campsites and access to vault toilets and water. Most campsites are well shaded. Boat camping is allowed in Snail Shell Harbor, and space is on a first-come, first-served basis. There is a beach on Sand Bay (Lake Michigan) just a short distance from the campground. The picnic area is adjacent to the beach and offers a picnic shelter, grills and vault toilets. Playground equipment and horsehoe courts are available.  Hiking  The park offers approx. of hiking trails. The trails are groomed in the winter for cross-country skiing. Trails wind through a hardwood forest, up beside dolomite cliffs (which are part of the Niagara Escarpment) and throughout the historic townsite.

Such algorithms must be optimized to efficiently fetch and access data stored in slow bulk memory (auxiliary memory) such as hard drives or tape drives, or when memory is on a computer network. External memory algorithms are analyzed in the external memory model.  Model  The cache on the left holds \\\\tfrac{M}{B} blocks of size B each, for a total of objects. The external memory on the right is unbounded. External memory algorithms are analyzed in an idealized model of computation called the external memory model (or I/O model, or disk access model). The external memory model is an abstract machine similar to the RAM machine model, but with a cache in addition to main memory. The model captures the fact that read and write operations are much faster in a cache than in main memory, and that reading long contiguous blocks is faster than reading randomly using a disk read-and-write head. The running time of an algorithm in the external memory model is defined by the number of reads and writes to memory required. The model was introduced by Alok Aggarwal and Jeffrey Vitter in 1988. The external memory model is related to the cache-oblivious model, but algorithms in the external memory model may know both the block size and the cache size. For this reason, the model is sometimes referred to as the cache-aware model. The model consists of a processor with an internal memory or cache of size , connected to an unbounded external memory. Both the internal and external memory are divided into blocks of size . One input/output or memory transfer operation consists of moving a block of contiguous elements from external to internal memory, and the running time of an algorithm is determined by the number of these input/output operations.  Algorithms  Algorithms in the external memory model take advantage of the fact that retrieving one object from external memory retrieves an entire block of size B. This property is sometimes referred to as locality. Searching for an element among N objects is possible in the external memory model using a B-tree with branching factor B. Using a B-tree, searching, insertion, and deletion can be achieved in O(\\\\log _B N) time (in Big O notation). Information theoretically, this is the minimum running time possible for these operations, so using a B-tree is asymptotically optimal. External sorting is sorting in an external memory setting. External sorting can be done via distribution sort, which is similar to quicksort, or via a \\\\tfrac{M}{B}-way merge sort. Both variants achieve the asymptotically optimal runtime of O(\\\\tfrac{N}{B} \\\\log _{\\\\tfrac{M}{B}} \\\\tfrac{N}{B}) to sort objects. This bound also applies to the fast Fourier transform in the external memory model. The permutation problem is to rearrange N elements into a specific permutation. This can either be done either by sorting, which requires the above sorting runtime, or inserting each element in order and ignoring the benefit of locality. Thus, permutation can be done in O(\\\\min (N, \\\\tfrac{N}{B} \\\\log _{\\\\tfrac{M}{B}} \\\\tfrac{N}{B})) time.  Applications  The external memory model captures the memory hierarchy, which is not modeled in other common models used in analyzing data structures, such as the random access machine, and is useful for proving lower bounds for data structures. The model is also useful for analyzing algorithms that work on datasets too big to fit in internal memory. A typical example is geographic information systems, especially digital elevation models, where the full data set easily exceeds several gigabytes or even terabytes of data. This methodology extends beyond general purpose CPUs and also includes GPU computing as well as classical digital signal processing. In general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU), powerful graphics cards (GPUs) with little memory (compared with the more familiar system memory, which is most often referred to simply as RAM) are utilized with relatively slow CPU- to-GPU memory transfer (when compared with computation bandwidth).  History  An early use of the term \\"out-of-core\\" as an adjective is in 1962 in reference to devices that are other than the core memory of an IBM 360. An early use of the term \\"out-of-core\\" with respect to algorithms appears in 1971.

She writes children's literature and some historical books, as well as poetry and commentaries. Weatherford is best known for her books Juneteenth Jamboree, Freedom in Congo Square, and You Can Fly: The Tuskegee Airmen. Notably, Weatherford has written literary criticisms of racist representations in children's entertainment. Today, she often writes with her son, Jeffery Boston Weatherford, who is an illustrator and poet.  Biography  The music of poetry has fascinated Weatherford and motivated her literary career. In an interview with The Brown Bookshelf she said: \\"The Creator called me to be a poet. I hear words strung together in my head just as a composer hears notes and chords. Scenes unfold in my mind just as they do on a filmmaker's storyboard. Like poetry, quality children's literature compresses language, distills feeling, evokes scenes, and can be experienced on multiple levels. The best poetry makes music with words.\\"Lyons, Kelly Starling (February 20, 2008), \\"Carole Boston Weatherford\\" (interview), The Brown Bookshelf. Weatherford began writing in first grade by dictating poems to her mother. Her father taught printing at a local high school and published his daughter's early works. As a child, she enjoyed reading Dr. Seuss and Langston Hughes. Continuing to pursue creative writing as a hobby through high school and college, she later earned her M.F.A. from the University of North Carolina at Greensborohttps://library.uncg.edu/collection/exhibits/Carole_Boston_Weatherford_2.aspx and an M.A. in publication design from the University of Baltimore. Although a Baltimore native, she now resides in North Carolina and teaches composition and children's literature at Fayetteville State University (FSU). Initially, Weatherford was invited to FSU as a writer-in-residence, but in 2007, she received the position of associate professor.Biography at ChildrensLit.com As an author, she acknowledges her calling \\"to mine the past for family stories, fading traditions and forgotten struggles.\\"Carole Boston Weatherford's Website The books she writes, in poetry and prose, explore African-American history from a children's perspective and relate the past to new generations. Her works are often inspired by true events, many of which took place in the areas where Weatherford has lived. In her Author's Notes for each book, she includes a portion of the historical research from which her fiction or poetry emerged. In describing her purpose for writing to School Library Journal, in a 2008 interview, she said: \\"I want the books that I write that are set during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights era to nudge today's kids toward justice. We've gone a long way, but we still have a long way to go.\\"Margolis, Rick (January 1, 2008), \\"She Shall Overcome: Poet Carole Boston Weatherford\\", School Library Journal. In 1995, Lee & Low Books published her first picture book, Juneteenth Jamboree, about a summer celebration in memory of the Texas Emancipation. She then wrote a series of board books for preschoolers. In 1998, she co-authored Somebody's Knocking at Your Door: AIDS and the African American Church, and then published a collection of poetry, The Tar Baby on the Soapbox. After establishing herself as a versatile writer for both children and adults, she published two nonfiction chapter books before penning her first award-winning children's book, The Sound That Jazz Makes (2001), a poem that traces the history of African-American music. Since then, she has continued to write poetry, historical fiction, and nonfiction biographical works for children. She said in a 2008 interview that one of the most important poems she has written was Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom: \\"Those inspired words came together with Kadir Nelson's soulful paintings and Ellice Lee's brilliant art direction in a perfect publishing storm. Moses propelled my career to another level.\\" Moses has won a Caldecott Award for illustration, as well as an NAACP Image Award for an Outstanding Literary Work for Children, and became a New York Times bestseller. In 2008, Weatherford published her first poetic novel for young adults, Becoming Billie Holiday, about the development of the artist who she refers to as her muse.  Literary Criticism  Weatherford has written multiple articles attacking what she identifies as stereotyped caricatures of black people in East Asian popular culture, with two of the more prominent ones being geared toward anime, and another aimed at the name of a toothpaste brand. Pok√©mon In January 2000, Weatherford wrote an op-ed piece that ran in newspapers across Alabama. \\"Politically Incorrect Pok√©mon\\" explained how she believed that Pok√©mon #124, Jynx, was a negative stereotype of African Americans: In response to the controversy, Jynx's in-game sprites were given a purple skin color in the American versions of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, released in late 2000. By 2002, Nintendo officially redesigned Jynx, changing her skin color from black to purple; this change was not reflected in the animated series until Jynx's purple skin appearance debuted in the episode \\"Mean With Envy!\\" (Ê∑∑Êà¶„ÄÅÊ∑∑‰π±ÔºÅ„Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥„Ç≥„É≥„ÉÜ„Çπ„Éà„Éª„Ç≠„Éä„ÇÆÂ§ß‰ºöÔºÅ ÔºàÂâçÁ∑®Ôºâ), which originally aired in 2005, with the Amazon Prime release of \\"Holiday Hi-Jynx\\" recoloring Jynx accordingly even though she is still black on the thumbnail. Dragon Ball In an article published in The Christian Science Monitor in May 2000, Weatherford reiterated and expanded on her argument. Jynx had looked like \\"an obese drag queen\\", and she also offered Mr. Popo, a character from the Dragon Ball franchise, up for critique: The Dragon Ball manga later released by Viz in 2003 had reduced the size of Mr. Popo's lips.

It is the second longest beach on the Coromandel Coast and one of the longest beaches in Asia. The 57 km-long stretch of beach faces severe seafront erosion.  Transportation  There are town buses which ply frequently between Cuddalore town bus stand and Silver Beach. It is also accessible via Taxis and Autos from different parts of the town. Water sports To the south of the beach the South Cuddalore Bay area appears as if it is a separate island. The backwater separating the main beach from the island-like structure is a safe place for water sports. Boats are not available for rent currently as the boat house has been closed. Mangrove To the west a river flows into dense mangrove forests teeming with birds. On the coast there is century-old lighthouse. A few resorts have sprung up in the area. Most of these are sponsored by the state government for promoting tourism. Forts in the beach Silver Beach is also the location of Fort St. David, which has a long history as one of the three important forts built by the British Empire. An arts college, Periyar College of Arts and Science, is situated near the beach. There are summer festivals celebrated in Silver Beach yearly during April or May.

It competes with other light valve technologies such as Digital Light Processing (DLP) and liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) for implementation in video projector devices such as rear-projection televisions. The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in optical applications, which is known as optical MEMS or micro-opto- electro-mechanical structures (MOEMS), has enabled the possibility to combine the mechanical, electrical and optical components in very small scale. Silicon Light Machines (SLM), in Sunnyvale CA, markets and licenses GLV technology with the capitalised trademarks Grated Light Valve and GLV, previously Grating Light Valve. The valve diffracts laser light using an array of tiny movable ribbons mounted on a silicon base. The GLV uses six ribbons as the diffraction gratings for each pixel. The alignment of the gratings is altered by electronic signals, and this displacement controls the intensity of the diffracted light in a very smooth gradation. Brief history The light valve was originally developed at Stanford University, in California, by electrical engineering professor David M. Bloom, along with William C. Banyai, Raj Apte, Francisco Sandejas, and Olav Solgaard, professor in the Stanford Department of Electrical Engineering. In 1994, the start-up company Silicon Light Machines was founded by Bloom to develop and commercialize the technology. Cypress Semiconductor acquired Silicon Light Machines in 2000 and sold the company to Dainippon Screen. Prior to the acquisition by Dainippon Screen several marketing articles were published in EETimes, EETimes China, EETimes Taiwan, Electronica Olgi, and Fibre Systems Europe highlighting Cypress Semiconductor new MEMS manufacturing capabilities. The company is now wholly owned by Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co., Ltd.Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. In July 2000, Sony announced the signing of a technology licensing agreement with SLM Sony Develops a Grating Light Valve display device that gives high resolution, excellent contrast ratio and wide color reproduction for the implementation of GLV technology in laser projectors for large venues, but by 2004 Sony announced the SRX-R110 front projector using its own LCoS- based technology SXRD. SLM then partnered with Evans & Sutherland (E&S;). Using GLV technology, E&S; developed the E&S; Laser Projector, designed for use in domes and planetariums.Digistar 3 Laser The E&S; Laser Projector was incorporated into the Digistar 3 dome projection system.  Technology  The GLV device is built on a silicon wafer and consists of parallel rows of highly reflective micro-ribbons ‚Äì ribbons of sizes of a few ¬µm with a top layer of aluminium ‚Äì suspended above an air gap that are configured such that alternate ribbons (active ribbons are interlaced with static ribbons) can be dynamically actuated. Individual electrical connections to each active ribbon electrode provide for independent actuation. The ribbons and the substrate are electrically conductive so that the deflection of the ribbon can be controlled in an analog manner: When the voltage of the active ribbons is set to ground potential, all ribbons are undeflected, and the device acts as a mirror so the incident light returns along the same path. When a voltage is applied between the ribbon and base conductor an electrical field is generated and deflects the active ribbon downward toward the substrate. This deflection can be as big as one-quarter wavelength hence creating diffraction effects on incident light that is reflected at an angle that is different from that of the incident light. The wavelength to diffract is determined by the spatial frequency of the ribbons. As this spatial frequency is determined by the photolithographic mask used to form the GLV device in the CMOS fabrication process, the departure angles can be very accurately controlled, which is useful for optical switching applications. Switching from undeflected to maximum ribbon deflection can occur in 20 nanoseconds, which is a million times faster than conventional LCD display devices, and about 1000 times faster than TI‚Äôs DMD technology. This high speed can be achieved thanks to the small size, small mass and small excursion (of a few hundreds of nanometers), of the ribbons. Besides, there is no physical contact between moving elements which makes the lifetime of the GLV as long as 15 years without stopping (over 210 billion switching cycles).  Applications  The GLV technology has been applied to a wide range of products, from laser-based HDTV sets to computer-to-plate offset printing presses to DWDM components used for wavelength management. Applications of the GLV device in maskless photolithography have also been extensively investigated.  Displays  To build a display system using the GLV device different approaches can be followed: ranging from a simple approach using a single GLV device with a white light as a source thus having a monochrome system to a more complex solution using three different GLV devices each for one of the RGB primaries' sources that once diffracted require different optical filters to point the light onto the screen or an intermediate using a single white source with a GLV device. Besides, the light can be diffracted by the GLV device into an eyepiece for virtual retinal display, or into an optical system for image projection onto a screen (projector and rear-projector).Teklas S.

Due to standardization on the American Sherman tank for frontline units, it was used exclusively for training purposes and was never used in combat as a gun tank. The chassis was used for several other combat roles however, such as a flamethrower tank, observation post, and armoured personnel carrier.  Development  Ram Mk.II (early production) tanks during the war Even before the loss of the majority of the United Kingdom's tank force in France in 1940 after Dunkirk, it was recognised that tank production in the UK at the start of the war was insufficient and capacity in the US was taken for British needs.Ellis and Chamberlain p3 So it was necessary that if Canada was to equip with tanks they would have to be manufactured locally.Ellis and Chamberlain In June 1940 the Canadian Pacific Railway's Angus Shops in Montreal, as the only large firm with spare capacity, had received a contract to produce 300 partially fitted out Valentine tanks for the British; this was followed later with one for 488 complete tanks for Canada.Ellis & Chamberlain p5 However the Valentine was an infantry tank and Canada required a cruiser tank for its recently formed armoured division. In the end 1,420 Valentines were produced by CPR, most of which were supplied to the USSR. Although the Valentine used a number of American produced parts, its reliance on British components, difficulties in adapting its manufacture to North American methods, and other problems such as limitations to the availability of the right type of armour plate affected Valentine production. The Canadian Joint Committee on Tank Development concluded, in September 1940, that its cruiser tank should be based on a US rather than a British design.Cameron, L.R.Tank Production in Canada AHQ Report 38, Department of National Defence Directorate of History and Heritage (DHH), 27 July 1950 This would be quicker and allow it to use components already in production for the US design.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969) p172 The Canadians were interested in production of the M3 Medium. However the M3 was an interim design; its main armament was in a side sponson, it was tall and under-armoured, and it was clear that it would be unsatisfactory for Canadian and British use. In early 1941 the Canadian Interdepartmental Tank Committee adopted a compromise: to develop a superior design locally but still using the M3 chassis.Ellis and Chamberlain p6 The British Tank Mission which was involved in the modifications of the M3 for British use contributed a tank expert, L.E. Carr, to design a new hull and turret for the Canadian tank which could take a 6-pounder (57 mm) or 75mm gun while retaining the lower hull of the US M3 Medium. The new hull was cast rather than welded or riveted and lower than that of the M3. The pilot model's turret and upper hull casting was produced in the US by General Steel Castings and later they aided the set up of Canadian production. Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) was chosen to make the new Canadian M.3 Cruiser Tank (as it was then known) and was given the funding to set up the Canadian Tank Arsenal at Longue Pointe. MLW was a subsidiary of the American Locomotive Company, which had experience in producing large castings and another ALCO subsidiary was producing cast hulls for the M3 Medium. Canadian engineers ran into many challenges when developing the tank as Canada had never produced a tank before. Along with the lack of knowledge, it took time for Canadian factories to gear up for the production of many of the Ram's components. Initially Canada relied heavily on United States and British materials to complete the construction of the Ram. Most critically the Ram's Continental engine and transmissions were available only in the USA and these were always in short supply. The Ram tank was developed with a turret which unlike the US M3 could traverse the main armament 360 degrees. Its fully cast armoured steel hull gave reinforced protection and, with the driver's seat repositioned to meet British requirements for right-hand drive, lower height; while the U.S.-designed chassis and power train ensured its overall reliability.Broad p27 Although it could mount a US 75 mm gun, the preferred armament for the Ram was the QF 6 pounder which had superior armour-piercing capability. As neither the 6 pounder nor the Canadian-designed mounting for it was immediately available, early production (50 tanks) were fitted with the 40 mm QF 2-pounder gun.Chamberlain and Ellis p172 A prototype Ram was completed in June 1941 and general production of the Ram I began in November of the same year. The Ram I and early Ram IIs were fitted with side doors in the hull and an auxiliary machine gun turret in the front. The former weakened the hull and complicated production, and the doors and the machine gun turret were discarded in later modifications. By February 1942 production had switched to the Ram II model with a 6-pounder gun and continued until July 1943. In March 1942 a decision had been made to change production over to the automotively- similar M4A1 Sherman tank for all British and Canadian units. Ram production continued due to delay in starting the new M4 production lines and a reluctance to let the plant lie idle. By July 1943 1,948 vehicles plus 84 artillery observation post (OP) vehicles had been completed. The official Canadian history of the war compares the Ram to the Ross rifle as examples of unsuccessful Canadian weapon designs. It states that given the Sherman's superiority, in retrospect it would probably have been better for the United States to produce more tanks, and for Canada to have focused on manufacturing more transport vehicles such as the successful Canadian Military Pattern truck designs. The Sexton self-propelled gun based on the Ram chassis, however, was very successful.  Combat history  Ram Mk.II ‚Äì late production As built, the Ram was never used in combat as a tank, but was used for crew training in Great Britain up to mid 1944. The observation post vehicles and Armoured Personnel Carrier, gun tractor, and munitions carrier versions of the Ram saw considerable active service in North West Europe. These tanks were mainly rebuilt by Canadian Army workshops in the United Kingdom. Conversions of Ram tanks with the Wasp II flamethrower gear were used by the 5th Canadian Armoured Brigade in the Netherlands in 1945.Ellis and Chamberlain p18 A Ram encased in the Dutch IJssel Line, still present in 2007 In 1945 the Royal Netherlands Army got permission from the Canadian government to take free possession of all Ram tanks in army dumps on Dutch territory. Those not already converted into Kangaroos were used to equip the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalion (1e en 2e Bataljon Vechtwagens), the very first Dutch tank units. These had a nominal organic strength of 53 each. However it proved to be impossible to ready enough tanks to attain this strength because the vehicles were in a very poor state of maintenance. In 1947 the UK provided 44 Ram tanks from its stocks, that were in a better condition. Forty of these had been rebuilt with the British 75 mm gun; four were OP/Command vehicles with a dummy gun. This brought the operational total for that year to just 73, including two Mark Is. In 1950 only fifty of these were listed as present. The Ram tanks (together with the Sherman tanks of the three other tank battalions, in part simply taken without permission) were replaced by Centurion tanks leased by the U.S. Government in 1952. Some Ram tanks were used in the 1950s as static pillboxes in the IJssel Line, their hulls dug in and embedded within two feet of concrete. Survivors One Dutch Ram tank, an OP/Command vehicle, survives at the Dutch Cavalry Museum in Amersfoort. A Ram tank modified as a Kangaroo serves as a memorial to the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment in Mill, Netherlands. Ram tanks can also be seen at the Canadian War Museum, in Worthington Park at Canadian Forces Base Borden, in front of the Beatty Street Drill Hall in Vancouver, and at the Bovington Tank Museum (both a tank and a Kangaroo)  Variants  thumb Ram Mk II ‚Äì early production Ram Mk II ‚Äì later production, with Mk III QF 6 pounder but still with auxiliary turret Ram OP/Command tank at Amersfoort ;Tank Cruiser, Ram Mk I : Ordnance QF 2 pounder / 40mm gun (171 rounds). ;Tank Cruiser, Ram Mk II : Early production: Mk III QF 6 pounder (57 mm) gun with 92 rounds. : Late production: Mk V six-pounder.

Its primary founder was Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, who called the school Shinkage-ry≈´. In 1565, Nobutsuna bequeathed the school to his greatest student, Yagy≈´ Munetoshi, who added his own name to the school. Today, the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ remains one of the most renowned schools of Japanese swordsmanship. Its name roughly means Yagy≈´ New Shadow School.  Feudal Japan and birth of the Shinkage school  At the time of the school's founding by Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, the superiority of a school was determined through duels. Basic postures were distinct; a very low stance was maintained, in the interest of protecting the body. The idea of winning at any price was deeply ingrained in the schools of the time, as were the concepts of Isatsu-no-tachi (the school of the sword that kills only once) or Ichi-no-tachi (the sword of only one cut). A great deal of importance was placed on the technology of swords and armor themselves. However, with the arrival of muskets (arquebuses) and other elements of modern warfare, these traditional techniques were no longer sufficient. Nobutsuna, with the creation of the Shinkage-ry≈´ (New Shadow School), changed basic postures by raising them slightly. He also changed the manner of holding the sword. The swords themselves were changed; in an era in which a sword could be two meters, Nobutsuna shortened the length of the blade. Most importantly, he perfected a new method of teaching to make the study and practice of the Way of the Sword easier. Before Nobutsuna, practice was carried out with either a very hard wooden sword (a bokken) or one with a dulled steel blade. The practitioners had to therefore stop their blows during teaching to avoid hurting themselves or their students. It is claimed that Kamiizumi created the practice sword called the fukuro shinai (frog bamboo sword), which is made of strips of bamboo similar to a kendo shinai but covered inside a leather pouch. The shinai allowed striking with quickness, fluidity and potency without causing serious or disabling wounds as one would with the wooden sword, and without having to stop the attacks. Nobutsuna, sensing the changes in the ways of war at the time, re-thought his methods of martial arts (bujutsu), and began to advocate the utilization of light armour during training. The face of war was being transformed, and as it was necessary to move faster than before. Nobutsuna perfected a style of sword fighting that was freer in its movements, more sparse, more restrained, more adapted to brawls and to duels, than to the fields of large scale battles. Nobutsuna created the ancient schools of sword known as satsujin-ken, or the killing swords. These are characterized by postures and offensive techniques, designed to win at any price. He wanted to establish tatsujin-ken‚Äîthe sword of an accomplished man, an Expert. The art of the sword of the Shinkage school takes into account and adapts to the opponent's weaponry, contrary to the former sword styles which taught to impose dominance without taking into account the opponent. The strategy of the Shinkage school takes into account the geography of the terrain, the hour of battle, and other parameters. For instance, to utilize the technique named empi, one must understand a deeper, secret level (gokui) of battle. In empi, (meaning, the \\"Swallow takes Flight\\") one uses a technique of spearing an opponent with a thrown sword. To do this, one learns to use the sword not only to defend his position but to also have the \\"power of adaptability\\" in facing different individuals, much as a captain must consider the winds and change sails in order to travel in the best direction to reach his objective. It is similar to a hunting hawk, which must constantly reconsider the best trajectory in which to strike effectively. Like the raptor, it is necessary to be able to anticipate, to be able to assess and definitively act. \\"Move with the mind, in order to move with the body\\" is one of the central tenets of the school. Another sword style is called Katsujin-ken (the One who preserves Life, the Sword of the Victor). Katsujin-ken teaches that, if one's sword does not stop the movement of the enemy, then one may try to fit to the opponent's rhythm, thus entering into the mind of the adversary to find his weakness.  Kamiizumi Nobutsuna's legacy  right The feudal lord Kamiizumi Nobutsuna led a simple life. Although he was not a monk, he kept his head shaved, which was a sign of renunciation of the everyday world. He did not have children and left all his property to his student Yagy≈´ Munetoshi. Munetoshi had gained his own renown as a remarkable swordsman even before Nobutsuna's passing. He began development of the mut≈ç techniques of using bare hands against the sword and it is he who appended the name of his family (Yagy≈´) onto the name of the school, founding the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´. His son, Yagy≈´ Munenori, later perfected the techniques of mut≈ç, and also created the techniques of iaijutsu. Upon Munetoshi's death in 1606, the school split into two. His grandson Yagy≈´ Toshiyoshi took command of the Owari branch, while Munenori became the head of the Edo branch. Takenaga Hayato, the founder of the Yagy≈´ Shingan Ry≈´ Heiho was a student and received the gokui of the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ under Yagy≈´ Munenori. The Edo branch, although no longer headed by a descendant of the Yagy≈´ family, continues to be practiced by a small, faithful group of practitioners in Osaka under the direction of Sono Seigo. The Owari branch of Nagoya continues under the guidance of a direct descendant of Munetoshi, Yagy≈´ K≈çichi Toshinobu. Munenori's son, Yagy≈´ J≈´bei Mitsuyoshi, contributed greatly, in turn, to the school. He was not only a master of sword, but also a strategist, an expert of jujutsu-yawara, ninjutsu, kemp≈ç and an ascetic who went on musha shugy≈ç, the warrior's ascetic journey. His sword technique was named chie-no-ken (sword of Transcendent Wisdom). The one who codified the techniques of the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ into its traditional form was the fifth soke (heir), Yagy≈´ Toshikane. He codified all the basic instruction (kihon- waza) into a document known as Hassei-h≈ç or more commonly Sei-h≈ç. These series were responsible for making understood the essential points of forms (kata) that had been transmitted by Munenori. Before the advent of modern kend≈ç, he created a form of free fighting in teaching with shinai. Latter, the 5th S≈çke, Yagy≈´ Renya and his father, the 3rd headmaster Hy≈çgonosuke, invented the concept of Tsuttattaru-mi (art of war without armor) to adapt their style to the current era where samurai would fight in civilian clothes, unlike orthodox Katori Shint≈ç-ry≈´ whose students always fight with samurai armor protection and weak points in mind, even when they don't wear one for training. Then came the Meiji era, where all martial arts schools had trouble to continue to exist. Many faded away, especially little schools started by r≈çnin trying to make a living, and Ishi-S≈çden family arts. But Meiji-Tenn≈ç directly ordered to Yagy≈´ Toshichika-s≈çke to permanently preserve the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´, and so he did. The 20th headmaster, Toshinaga, even moved to Tokyo and became the instructor to the Imperial Guards and taught in Butokukai seminars in order to spread further Shinkage-ry≈´. The Owari d≈çj≈ç in Nagoya who existed since Edo period burned down in the World War Two, but the school managed to survive because of that. Connection with Morihei Ueshiba Nakai Masakatsu (‰∏≠‰∫ï Ê≠£Âãù, fl. 1891-1908), a teacher whose own teachers had been proficient in Shinkage- ry≈´ and Yagy≈´ Shingan Ry≈´ Taijutsu, taught these arts to Morihei Ueshiba (the founder of aikido) from 1903 to 1908, in his dojo in Sakai near Osaka. At the time, Ueshiba was serving in the 61st Regiment in the Japanese Army. In 1908 Masakatsu gave Ueshiba a mid level license in Got≈çha Yagy≈´ Shingan Ry≈´ Taijutsu.Ueshiba, Kisshomaru. (1985). in Aikido (Illustrated Japanese Classics) Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ in the United States Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ was also taught in the United States from 1981-1988 by Yagyu Hideki. The authority to teach the art was given to Hideki's student-turned-adopted-son who runs a school near Kobe, Japan, and to his two top American students‚Äîone of whom (as of 2005) resides in China where he teaches the art, and the other in the United States who, as of 2012, is in training to return to teaching. Only Hideki's son and two top American students were issued permission to teach the art to anyone else. The Edo branch has a United States representative under Sono Seigo with permission to teach the art. Paul Manogue runs a group out of Philadelphia in Old City Aikido.

Eads transitioned later in life and as such it was deemed inadvisable to seek surgical sex assignment to male genitalia. Eads was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996, but as an example of the social stigma faced by transgender individuals, more than a dozen doctors refused to medically treat him on the grounds that taking him on as a patient might harm their practice. When he was finally accepted for treatment in 1997 the cancer had \\"already metastasized to other parts of the body, rendering any further treatments futile.\\" Family life Eads began transitioning in his forties, after a marriage to a man and after having borne two children. Eads later described being pregnant as \\"the best and the worst (time) in my life,\\" as he was thrilled by the feeling of having another life grow inside him, but was also disgusted by the fact that his pregnancy made him as a trans man feel even more \\"trapped\\" inside his female body. He divorced his husband after the birth of their second son, and presented for some time as a lesbian, though he would later point out that he always viewed his attraction to women as the product of being a heterosexual man rather than a homosexual woman. Transition Eads began transitioning in the late 1980s following a move to Florida. He began testosterone therapy and underwent top surgery, in which breast tissue is removed, to create a male physique. However, given his age (early- to mid-40s) as well as the fact that he had already begun to show symptoms of menopause, Eads was counseled that he would not need to undergo a hysterectomy and oophorectomy as part of his sexual reassignment. Likewise, Eads never underwent phalloplasty. After living in Florida for some time, and following the failure of his second marriage (to a female psychologist), Eads moved back to Georgia in 1996.Southern Comfort (2001), a 90-minute feature-length documentary about the life of Robert EadsSouthern Comfort (2001) - Deleted scene: \\"Robert on Family\\" In 1996, after a severe bout of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, Eads sought emergency medical treatment, and received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. However, more than a dozen doctors subsequently refused to treat Eads on the grounds that taking him on as a patient might harm their practice. It was not until 1997 that Eads was finally accepted for treatment by the Medical College of Georgia hospital, where he underwent surgical, medical, and radiation therapy over the next year.Southern Comfort (2001) - Deleted scene: \\"Robert on the Medical Process\\" By the time Southern Comfort was filmed in 1998, the cancer had metastasized to the uterus, cervix, and other abdominal organs, and his prognosis was poor.

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League Canada Life Premier League. They wear tangerine and black strips and play home games at the Andreas Playing Fields in Andreas village. They are Coached by Steven Jauncey, Liam Christian and Elliott Cureton. As well as Eddie Cleator and Dan Fargher for the 2nd team. The Ayre United Captain is Jamie Callister. History The club was formed on 10 April 1967, and applied to play in the Isle of Man Football League Division Two for the 1967‚Äì68 season. They finished their first season on just four points. However, within two season they had their first trophy when they won the Woods Cup and the Fred Faragher Cup. The club have been Division Two champions four times. They were first promoted in 1976‚Äì77. After being promoted in 1986‚Äì87 they stayed in Division One and achieved the club's highest league placing in 1988‚Äì89 when they were Division One runners-up. In the 1995‚Äì96 season they finished as runners-up to the Police in Division Two and won both the Woods Cup and the Paul Henry Gold Cup. The club's highest achievement came in the 2002‚Äì03 season when they won the Manx FA Cup at The Bowl stadium in Douglas, beating St Georges 2‚Äì1. In the 2004‚Äì05 season they finished third in Division One. As 2019 draws to an end, the last decade for Ayre United, to say the least can be classed as turbulent. The club started the decade in strong form winning the Woods Cup in 12/13 season, however that turned out to be the high point of the clubs recent history. As the midpoint of the decade arrived the Ayre United was arguably at the lowest point in the club's lucrative 50+ year history. As the legendary FA cup winning players came to the end of their careers, Ayre struggled fielding teams often having to forfeit game after game. The true extent of the struggle to field a team became apparent when even cult hero, Liam \\"Lugsy\\" Lord racked up some appearances. Despite this in the past two years, \\"the Tangerines\\" have begun their ascend from darkness. A combination of players returning to the club, upcoming exciting youth players, and top of the range management has gave the club a new feeling of hope. The inside view is that the next decade will see a new group of players put their names into the history books. They currently aspire to compete in the Premier League next season.  2020/21 Season  As a result of the Great Plague, the 19/20 season was unfortunately voided, meaning all the Tangerines hard work to get into a very promising position was about to go unrewarded. However, justice was done when Pulrose pulled out of the first division for 20/21 season, meaning the FA were forced to promote the best team from division 2. Insiders have leaked it was an easy and quick decision, which meant Ayre United were back where they belonged. During pre-season Ayre have been blessed with the return of the former Guatemalan international Dan Faragher, known as Septo to his teammates, translating to battle horse in English. Joining as a player-coach, he has brought his South American flavour to the Andreas playing fields and the players can not wait to see what else he to bring to the club. Ayre's 5 year wait to return to the Premier division is unlikely to be disappointing. Managers Liam Christian and Steve Jauncey have the whole team playing a new, exciting brand of football, which is likely to challenge some of the big teams. Facilities The first clubhouse was an old RAF hut transported from Jurby airfield and opened in 1968. This was replaced and a new clubhouse opened at Easter, 1999. Ayre United were the first club on the Isle of Man to have floodlights, which were installed in 1972. A new club bar was opened on 28 May 2006. The club hope to build new changing facilities. The clubhouse is nicknamed the \\"Fortress\\". Rumour has it whenever the club attacks the infamous \\"sh*thouse end\\" in the second half in need of a result, something magical happens. Teams As well as the first team Ayre United also have reserves team that plays in the Isle of Man Football Combination captained by the mighty Ben Ashworth as well a women's team captained by James Bucuris and various age range teams from Under-7s to Under-17s. Despite an average age of 24, they have some freakishly good future prospects. To name some names the infamous Burger (Ryan Teare) aged 18, renowned for his vicious left peg. Alongside him another exciting young player Chesney (a prolific youth attacker), also known as Deacon Lombard-Chibnall.

The team wears royal blue strips and plays home games at Cronkbourne Football Ground, Victoria Road, Douglas.  History 1923 to 1930  Braddan Association Football Club was founded in 1923 under the Chairmanship of Mr Frederick Clucas (later Sir Frederick), and was admitted to play in the Second League for their inaugural season. A playing pitch was established on land owned by Clucas‚Äô Laundry at Cronkbourne, Tromode, which was to be the club's home until 1995. Owing to the close links with the company which were to last for several decades, the club was soon nicknamed ‚ÄòThe Laundrymen‚Äô. Blue was chosen as the club colour. Braddan's first competitive match was played on 20 October 1923 and resulted in a 6-2 victory at home to Ramsey-based club St Olave's. The team never looked back, and won the Second League title by a convincing margin in that first season. The club received great praise in the local press during the season, not only for the quality of the football played by the team but also for the standard of the pitch and surroundings at Cronkbourne. In that era of Manx football there was no automatic promotion and relegation, but Braddan's application to play in the First League was duly accepted for the 1924/25 season, with the reserve team playing in the Second League. Several years of consolidation in the top flight of Manx football followed, and Braddan's progress attracted a steady stream of quality footballers to the club. Prominent players in the club's early years were Alan Doig, a Scotsman who was a prolific goal scorer, and goalkeeper Leslie Evans - a renowned figure in Manx sport. In the 1929/30 season Braddan secured their first major trophy, being crowned First League champions after a magnificent campaign. It was a brilliant achievement to reach the summit of Manx football just seven years into the club's existence, and the team remained unbeaten until the last two games of the campaign - by which time they had already secured the title. This was to be the beginning of a decade of great success, during which Braddan became part of what was dubbed by the press ‚ÄòThe Eternal Triangle‚Äô of trophy winners alongside Peel and Rushen United.  History 1930 to 1939  The First League title was retained in the 1930/31 season, when Braddan also won their first cup with a 2-0 triumph over local rivals Gymns in the Railway Cup Final played at Port St Mary. Both goals were scored by team captain Wally Noble. The Railway Cup was retained the following year when four goals from legendary centre-forward Tim Tickle gave Braddan a 4-2 success over Ramsey at Peel. Tim Tickle was probably the finest player ever to pull on the blue shirt of Braddan, and such was his ability that in 1935 he left the island to play a season as a professional for Coleraine in Northern Ireland. Despite playing in a struggling team he scored 25 goals, and he was asked to stay on the following season. However he opted to return home, and resumed his career with Braddan having relinquished his professional status. In all it was estimated that he scored around 500 goals for his only local club during a career that lasted into the 1950s. He could score goals from all angles and was a superb header of the ball. His trademark was to receive the ball on the halfway line with his back to goal, turn his marker, surge forward and crack the ball into the net with power and accuracy from the edge of the penalty area. Braddan won the Hospital Cup for the first time in 1936 with a 4-1 win over St George's at Tromode Park, helped by a hat- trick from another of Braddan best-ever players, outside left Henry Charlier. With Tim Tickle restored to the ranks for the 1936/37 season Braddan retained the Hospital Cup with a 5-1 thumping of Ramsey at Tromode Park (Tickle scoring twice), and were also crowned First League champions for the third time following a controversial and stormy victory at Peel in the final game. A decision to award Braddan a decisive penalty late in the game resulted in the referee and Braddan's FA Executive member needing a police escort from the ground to protect them from an angry mob. The 1937/38 season was the greatest in Braddan's history, and at the end of it three major trophies adorned the Clucas‚Äô Laundry boardroom. Playing highly skilful football they won their fourth First League title, and regained the Railway Cup with a magnificent 3-0 win over their greatest rivals Peel at Port St Mary. Two goals from Charlier and one from Tickle sealed Braddan's success on New Year's Day in front of a crowd of around 3,000. For the only time in the club's history Braddan secured the FA Cup, again beating Peel in the final which was played at Tromode Park. A penalty save by goalkeeper Bernard Fick was the catalyst for Braddan to surge into a 3-0 lead, with two goals from Tickle and a penalty from skipper George Bridson. Peel's late rally brought the score to 3-2, but Braddan held on to complete their greatest triumph. Only a narrow defeat in the Hospital Cup final ‚Äì yet again Peel were the opponents ‚Äì prevented Braddan from achieving the grand slam. The 1938/39 season ended in disappointment and controversy. Braddan played arguably their best ever football during this campaign, and were unbeaten in the league with one match to play. That match was against their only challengers Peel, with Braddan needing just a draw to be crowned champions for the fifth time. The clubs failed to agree a suitable date for the game, which was eventually set to be played before the start of the 1939/40 season. Following the outbreak of War the match was never played, and the title was not awarded ‚Äì denying Braddan a potential hat-trick of league titles. During a decade plagued by regular controversy and bitterness in Manx football ‚Äì usually involving Peel - Braddan was consistently acknowledged as a club that displayed great sportsmanship as well as footballing talent. Many Braddan players were regulars in the senior Isle of Man team throughout the 1930s. Mr Thomas ‚ÄòTossie‚Äô Clucas, a leading figure in establishing Braddan as a top club in Manx football, was also a highly respected representative for the club at the Isle of Man Football Association, where he served as Vice President for many years and was later elevated to President.  History 1945 to 1960  The club closed down for the duration of War, but re-established in 1945. Many of the successful pre-War players returned, and Braddan reached the finals of both Cup competitions played that season. The FA Cup Final against Peel at KGV Park in Douglas resulted in a 1-1 draw, before Peel won the replay 2-1 at the same venue. The attendances for the two matches were 4,300 and 4,290 ‚Äì the two highest attendances ever recorded for matches between two local clubs. It was Braddan's day in the Hospital Cup Final though, when they gained revenge on Peel with a 3-2 win at KGV Park, the goals coming from three pre-War heroes Percy Beedon, Alf Craine (penalty) and Tim Tickle. Over the next few years the team gradually declined as age caught up with many of the great players from the 1930s. A brief return to former glories came with another FA Cup Final in 1951. Braddan put up a great fight against Rushen in front of another huge crowd of 3,600 at KGV Park, but a last-minute goal gave the southerners a 2-1 victory. Braddan's first relegation followed in 1952, but by then the club was building for the future with a strong youth policy which was rewarded by winning the Cowell Cup that same season. Braddan bounced straight back to the big time, winning the Division 2 title at the first attempt and doubling up by also securing the Hospital Cup which was contested by Division 2 clubs that season. The leading scorers were two of the stars of the previous season's Cowell Cup triumph, Brian Simpson and George ‚ÄòJinx‚Äô Caine. The latter, a speedy and skilful outside right, had already been selected for the senior IOM team at just 17 years of age, and the following season he was signed by Stockport County where he played for the next two seasons. The 1st Team made a wonderful start to the 1953/54 season on their return to Division 1. They won five of their opening seven league matches, scoring 40 goals, and received great acclaim for the quality of their attacking play. They ultimately had to settle for a sixth- place finish, and over the next few years they steadily consolidated their top flight status. In 1955 it was the turn of the Combination team to take the limelight as they brought the Junior Cup to Cronkbourne for the first time. They beat Ramsey 1-0 in the Final which was played at Onchan Stadium. The latter half of the 1950s was dominated by problems and tragedy off the field. In May 1956 the club pavilion, which dated back to pre-War days when cricket was also played on the ground, was destroyed by fire along with much of the club's property. A loan from the Isle of Man Football Association enabled the club to purchase a second-hand sectional building, which was assembled by club members and made ready for use as a clubhouse late in 1957. It served as the club's headquarters until 1988. A dark day in the history of Braddan Football Club, and of the Isle of Man, came on 27 February 1958. Four club members ‚Äì Tom Callow, Louis Cowin, Arthur Gleave and Arthur Tonkin - died in the Winter Hill air disaster which claimed a total of 35 Manx lives. The charter aircraft was taking local businessmen, mainly from the motor trade but also some from Clucas‚Äô Laundry, on a day trip to Manchester to visit the Exide Battery Factory. A tragic navigational error in thick mist led to the aircraft crashing close to the summit of Winter Hill above Horwich, Lancashire. A memorial plaque to the four lost members is on permanent display in Braddan's clubhouse.  History 1960 to 1970  The 1960s was a decade of optimism, innovation and a new identity. In 1962 a club badge was designed and this was displayed on the team's shirts from the start of the 1962/63 season. It featured a motif of a swan and a football, inspired by the family of swans that inhabited the dam and river adjacent to the home pitch at Cronkbourne. A match report in the local press dubbed Braddan ‚ÄòThe Swans‚Äô, and the new nickname was adopted and has been used ever since. In the early part of the decade it was the Combination team who provided the excitement. During that era and up until 1967, the Combination teams were split into two regional leagues, with the champions of the North and South divisions playing a decider ‚Äì effectively a Cup Final - for the Combination league title. Braddan reached the decider three seasons in a row as ‚Äòsouthern‚Äô champions. In 1961/62 they lost to Peel, but gained revenge on the westerners with a 3-2 victory after extra time to clinch the title in 1962/63. That season was doubly successful as Braddan landed the Junior Cup for the second time, beating Laxey 4-0 in the final played at the Bowl. The following year they drew 3-3 with Ramsey after extra time in the league decider, so the title was shared. The 1st Team made a steady start to the decade, but in 1963/64 they enjoyed their best league season since the halcyon days of the 1930s. They finished in fourth place in Division 1, indeed challenging for the title for much of the season. The following four seasons were something of an anti-climax as the team returned to the lower reaches of the table, but in 1968 Braddan became one of the first clubs in Manx football to engage a manager to take charge of football matters. Wilf Southern was appointed to the position, and the effect was immediate. The 1st Team, fitter and better organised, rose to a fifth-place finish in the 1968/69 season, and club stalwart Artie Kewley was named IOM Footballer of the Year ‚Äì the only Braddan player to date to receive this honour. The 1969/70 season was magnificent as Braddan suggested that they could finally recapture some of the glories of the 1930s. The 1st team finished third in Division 1, the highest position attained since the War, while the Combination team won both the Combination 1 league title and the Junior Cup, the latter with a 3-1 victory over St George's in the final at Castletown.  History 1970 to 1980  There was real optimism that the 1970s could be the decade when Braddan returned to the top of Manx football, but it was not to be. The decade in fact proved to be the most turbulent in Braddan's history with three relegations, three promotions, a sponsorship deal, and some shock news from Clucas‚Äô Laundry over the club's future tenancy of the Cronkbourne pitch. By this stage of Braddan's history the very close links between the club and the laundry had diminished, and in 1972 the club was first informed that the football field had been assigned by the company for future industrial development. At any stage from then onwards, the club could be given three months‚Äô notice to leave the site. This was the beginning of what were to be 23 years of uncertainty and frustration before the club finally vacated the pitch and became established at a new venue. It was a difficult time on the pitch too as the first team dropped from third place to bottom in two seasons, and were relegated in 1972. The Combination team won the Combination 2 title the following season as the 1st Team narrowly missed promotion, but Braddan bounced back to the top flight in style in 1974 as convincing Division 2 champions after a wonderful season. After a promising return to the big time, another relegation followed in 1975/76, but that season will be best remembered for Braddan producing one of the most famous FA Cup upsets of all time with a sensational 4-3 home win over Peel in the quarter final. The western side had been nigh-on unbeatable in Manx football for several years and this was one of the most celebrated results in Braddan's history. There was another revival in 1976/77 as a fine league season saw Braddan promoted once again. The highlight of that season however was the club's first success in the Woods Cup. A superb individual goal from 16-year-old Stewart Cain near the end sealed a sweet 2-0 triumph over local rivals Gymns in the final played at the Bowl. The following season brought bitter disappointment as Braddan were relegated again on goal difference despite picking up 14 points from 20 games under the two points for a win system. Just one point separated the five teams fighting to avoid the second relegation spot, and the battle went to the last kick of the season. A further promotion followed in the 1978/79 season when club captain Neil Mackie was named Division 2 Player of the Year. The reserves were runaway winners of the Combination 2 title, and Braddan's crop of promising teenagers reached the Cowell Cup Final. That match, played at Peel, was ultimately won 4-3 by St George's ‚Äì but Braddan played a full part in what was hailed as one of the best and most exciting games seen in Manx football for years. During that season the club also secured its first sponsorship deal with Howstrake & Highlander Hotels, and following a relaxation of IOMFA rules the company's logo was allowed to be displayed on the club's shirts and on an advertising banner at the pitch. Several top players were signed in the summer of 1979, and under the management of long- time goalkeeper Malcolm Macdonald, the 1st team made a magnificent start to the 1979/80 season back in Division 1. They played some brilliant free-scoring football, and became the first Braddan side since 1963 to qualify for the Railway Cup semi-finals. They also reached the Hospital Cup semi-final and finished fifth in Division 1, while the Combination team finished in fourth place. Four Braddan players - goalkeeper Peter Corris, centre-back Neil Mackie, midfielder Keith Kermeen and striker Chris Bass - were selected for the senior Isle of Man squad.  History 1980 to 1990  The 1980s was a tough decade for the club, during which footballing matters were to become secondary to the problems of developing and funding a new ground. Clucas‚Äô Laundry continued to allow the club the use of the Cronkbourne pitch on a season-by- season basis through the decade as an economic downturn had stalled their plans to develop the site. The club had taken out a lease on land owned by IOM Sports Council between Glencrutchery Road and Victoria Road in Douglas, but this land needed much work to be made ready for use as a football pitch and a clubhouse was still to be built. The many difficulties encountered with the development and funding of the new site were to threaten the very existence of the club over the following 15 years. On the field, the great promise of the 1979/80 season was sadly not sustained and relegation followed in 1982. The Combination 2 title was secured for the third time in the 1982/83 season, but the 1st team missed out on promotion. The club bounced back in fine style in 1984/85, winning both the Division 2 and Combination 2 titles and returning to the top flight after a three-year absence. A piece of history was made in 1985 as for the first time a junior Braddan team was established, entering the Under-14 league in the 1985/86 season. For the next three seasons the 1st team worked very hard to maintain their Division 1 status, and achieved a seventh- place finish in the 1986/87 season. Following a decade of preparation, Braddan announced that the club would move to its new venue from the start of the 1988/89 season. The ground was named ‚ÄòCronkbourne‚Äô in order to preserve historical links with the original pitch, and a temporary changing facility was erected to be used until a clubhouse had been constructed. The historic first match on the new ground was played against neighbours St George's on 17 September 1988, but it was already clear that the drainage system installed by a local contractor was inadequate. No further games could be played on the pitch, and Braddan spent two seasons as ‚Äònomads‚Äô playing on pitches hired from Douglas Corporation. It was a very difficult and disappointing time for the club, compounded by financial problems through crippling loan repayments associated with the new ground. It was perhaps inevitable in such circumstances that the club suffered relegation at the end of the season after four seasons in the top division. As a new decade dawned there was a welcome boost in the form of another Combination 2 title win in the 1989/90 season, and later that summer Clucas‚Äô Laundry agreed to the club making a short-term return to the Cronkbourne pitch. By that stage the clubhouse on the site had been destroyed, and portable units were installed on site to provide essential facilities. The pitch, vacant for over two years, was soon restored to good condition, and the club was to play there for five more seasons.

She is the third vessel to be so named after the concept of freedom. She is the design competitor produced by the Lockheed Martin consortium, in competition with the General Dynamics‚Äìdesigned . She was officially accepted by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding Gulf Coast, on behalf of the US Navy, from the Lockheed Martin/Marinette Marine/Gibbs and Cox team, in Marinette, Wisconsin, on 18 September 2008. She is designed for a variety of missions in shallow waters, minesweeping and humanitarian relief, capable against submarines and small ships, but not designed to take on large warships. The ship is a semi-planing monohull design capable of over . Commissioned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 8 November 2008, Freedom is home-ported in San Diego, and assigned to Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One. On 20 June 2020, the US Navy announced that they would be taking Freedom out of commission in March 2021, and placing her, along with , , and in reserve. Design USS Freedom with original gray paint scheme in September 2009 Freedom is the first of two dramatically different LCS designs being produced; the other, , is a trimaran built by a team led by General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works and Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama. Freedom is designed to be a fast, maneuverable, and networked surface combatant for missions such as anti-mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare and humanitarian relief.US Navy LCS website The ship is a semi-planing steel monohull with an aluminum superstructure. The friction stir welded aluminum deckhouse is very flat which, combined with an angular design, makes it difficult for radar systems to detect. The ship is in length, displaces fully loaded and can exceed . The design incorporates a large reconfigurable seaframe to allow rapidly interchangeable mission modules, a flight deck with integrated helicopter launch, recovery and handling system and the capability to launch and recover boats (manned and unmanned) from both the stern and side. The flight deck is 1.5 times the size of that of a standard surface ship, and uses a Trigon traversing system to move helicopters in and out of the hangar. The ship has two ways to launch and recover various mission packages: a stern ramp and a starboard side door near the waterline. The mission module bay has a 3-axis crane for positioning modules or cargo. The fore deck has a modular weapons zone which can be used for a BAE Systems Mk 110 gun mount or missile launcher. A Rolling Airframe Missile launcher is mounted above the hangar for short-range defense against aircraft and cruise missiles, and .50 caliber (12.7 mm) gun mounts are provided topside. The core crew will be 40 sailors, usually joined by a mission package crew and an aviation detachment for a total crew of about 75. Automation allows a reduced crew, which greatly reduces operating costs, but workload can still be \\"grueling.\\" Four Fincantieri Isotta-Fraschini diesel generators provide of electrical power to power the ship systems. Freedom has relaxed stability so it can rapidly change course. Concept of operations The operational concept includes deployment of a two or three-ship squadron to operate in the littorals to counter anti-access forces and to support the operations of the U.S. Navy and other friendly surface ships. The operational concept is in direct support of the U.S. Navy's Maritime Strategy, \\"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower.\\" Principal capabilities include shallow-water anti- submarine warfare, mine countermeasures and defense against attacking small boats. LCS ships are to be networked to share tactical information with other units. Freedom will be initially based in San Diego with two crews which will alternate four-month tours of sea duty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that fuel will account for only \\"8 percent to 18 percent\\" of the total life-cycle costs for Freedom. Senator Jeff Sessions has called the report into question and has suggested that Independence, built in his state, would be more fuel efficient and that less frequent refuelings would affect military operations beyond the cost of fuel. History=Construction The construction contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin's LCS team (Lockheed Martin, Gibbs & Cox, Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards) on 15 December 2004. Her keel was laid down on 2 June 2005, by Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin. The ship was sponsored by Birgit Smith, the widow of United States Army Sergeant 1st Class Paul Ray Smith, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Her initials are welded on the ship's keel. The couple's Saint Christopher medal and wedding bands are embedded in the ship's mast. Freedom was launched on 23 September 2006, cost overruns during Freedoms construction, combined with projected future overruns, led the government to issue a \\"Stop-work\\" in January 2007. On 25 April 2008, the New York Times ran a highly critical article, arguing that both Freedom and competitor Independence demonstrated a failure of the Navy's littoral combat ship program. Prior to delivery, the U.S. Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) conducted acceptance trials aboard Freedom, 17‚Äì21 August. INSURV found the ship to be \\"capable, well-built and inspection-ready\\" and recommended that the Chief of Naval Operations authorize delivery of the ship. Because the trials were conducted in Lake Michigan, some ship systems, including aviation and combat systems, could not be demonstrated. Systems not demonstrated during the trials were to be presented to INSURV in early 2009 trials in Norfolk, and in the open ocean. The inspection discovered 2,600 total discrepancies, of which 21 were considered high-priority deficiencies. \\"As part of LCS 1 acceptance trials, the Navy‚Äôs Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) identified 21 critical ‚Äústarred‚Äù deficiencies and recommended the Chief of Naval Operations authorize delivery of LCS-1 after correction or waiver of these deficiencies. According to Navy officials, only 9 of these deficiencies were corrected prior to delivery. Navy officials report that transiting the ship away from Marinette, Wisconsin, prior to the winter freeze was a higher priority than timely correction of starred deficiencies. The Navy intends to correct remaining deficiencies during planned post-delivery maintenance availabilities.\\" One of the issues with the ship is that it is six percent overweight and therefore more likely to sink if damaged. This seems to have been caused by design changes during construction. The Navy says that the ship will require special operating procedures until this is corrected. The workaround selected will be to install external tanks for additional buoyancy. The Navy stated that Freedom now meets the damage stability requirement with the addition of the external tanks and that the design of includes additional stability improvements. Other issues include difficulty with the slow speed operations required for deep sea refueling, no ability to UNREP other supplies aboard other than by helicopter, and problems with side-door launches of remotely operated vehicles. commissioning in 2008 Freedom was delivered to the Navy on 18 September 2008, and commissioned in Milwaukee, on 8 November 2008, Commanders Donald D. Gabrielson, (CO Blue) and Michael P. Doran, (CO Gold) in command. On 12 June 2009, the Navy confirmed that Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, had ordered a study of an early deployment of Freedom, before the expected date of 2012. Anonymous sources inside Lockheed Martin, reported that Roughead, wanted to use the first LCS to patrol for pirates off the coast of Somalia. On 13 October 2009, the Department of Defense announced Freedom would be deployed two years ahead of schedule. For this deployment 20 additional sailors will be carried for Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure operations in two shipping containers in the mission module cargo area. These containers will not include sanitary facilities, so they will be forced to use the ones in the ship's berthing spaces. About half of the 20 member boarding team will be temporarily replaced with United States Coast Guard law enforcement officers for some portion of the deployment. John C. Harvey, Jr., said that while the deployment was a success, manning may need adjustment. Operations In her limited time at sea, Freedom has been \\"plagued by flawed designs and failed equipment since being commissioned, has at least 17 known cracks, and has repeatedly been beset by engine-related failures.\\" On 15 February 2010, Freedom set sail from Naval Station Mayport on its first deployment to support SOUTHCOM operations. On 22 February, off the coast of Colombia, the ship pursued a possible drug-running boat. The boat fled back into Colombian coastal waters and Freedoms crew recovered of cocaine that had been dumped overboard by the boat's crew. On 4 April 2010, Freedom entered the 3rd Fleet area of responsibility; carrying Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 22, Det. 2, a LCS Surface Warfare Mission Package, and a U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment.USS Freedom (LCS 1) enters 3rd Fleet She was expected to be dry docked in San Diego‚Äôs Nassco shipyard so that her outer starboard waterjet could be replaced. On 12 September 2010, the starboard Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbine broke down and the ship had to rely on her diesel engines to return to port. CNO Roughead, said that the media had overhyped the issue and that such breakdowns were not uncommon. During a heavy-weather ocean trial in February 2011, the ship developed a crack in its hull that leaked of water an hour. The Navy proceeded to investigate, the problem appearing to be due to faulty welds rather than a design error. The repairs were scheduled to begin on 27 June 2011, and last until 19 September. On February 2012, Freedom suffered minor flooding while underway off Southern California. An inflatable boot seal was deployed in a successful effort to contain the flooding, and the ship returned to San Diego, on its own power. This marked a return to the dry dock before the ship even completed its last post-repair shakedown. A \\"special trial\\" conducted in May 2012, found the ship fit for the deployment. In July 2012, Freedom was dry docked in order to expand berthing by 20 and for firefighting and boat handling improvements. After another docking to apply a new paint scheme and apply another fix for the aft ramp, she departed for Singapore, with a core crew of 50, plus 3 trainees, plus a mission crew with berthing for 98. Additional crew above that level will again be bedded in the cargo spaces. On 15 January 2013, the U.S. Defense Department's director of operational test and evaluation released a judgement of the LCS in an annual study. The report said that Freedom was \\"not expected to be survivable\\" in combat. Helicopters on board the ship cannot tow its mine-hunting sensors, so it must rely on unmanned systems for mine countermeasures, although those systems are not in service, and will not be for several years. Her Mk44 Bushmaster IIs \\"exhibit reliability problems.\\" The 57 mm Mk 110 gun is differently designed on the Freedom class, which cause vibrations at high speeds that make accurate firing difficult. The integrated weapons systems and air/surface search radar have ‚Äúperformance deficiencies‚Äù that affect the ship‚Äôs ‚Äútracking and engagement of contacts.‚Äù In early 2013, the vessel took part in the National Geographic TV show \\" INSIDE: 21ST CENTURY WARSHIP \\" along with Independence. RAM launcher on the hangar. Freedom left for a 10-month deployment to Singapore, in March 2013. On 11 March 2013, Freedom became the first LCS to reach Hawaii. On 16 March, while en route to Singapore, the ship briefly lost power when one of the diesel engines shut down. On 18 April, Freedom arrived at the Changi Naval Base in Singapore, set to participate in joint military exercises. On 18‚Äì19 May, Freedom participated in the Republic of Singapore Navy's Open House 2013 at Changi Naval Base. Visitors to the Open House were allowed to board and visit Freedom. On 21 May, Freedoms first venture from Singapore harbor was cut short by another equipment failure, followed on 20 July 2013, by another breakdown requiring a return to port. The frequent breakdowns found the crew short of the Navy's sleep requirement, even with the maximum possible core crew and help from contractors and the mission module crew. Although billed as a trip for training and international cooperation exercises, Freedom conducted standard patrols while in the South China Sea. Despite suffering several breakdowns, the deployment was deemed a success from a research and development platform standpoint; while deployed for 10 months, the ship had 70 percent availability, on par with most other forward deployed ships in the fleet. In November 2013, Freedom delivered relief supplies to the Philippines, in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, from off shore, using her own and another ship's helicopters. From 25 April‚Äì16 May 2014, Freedom conducted the future concept of operations (CONOPS) for manned and unmanned helicopters aboard littoral combat ships. Operations had the manned MH-60R working together with the unmanned MQ-8B Fire Scout. The demonstration included one MH-60R/S Seahawk and one MQ-8B flying with the surface warfare (SUW) mission package installed, intended to provide fleet protection against small boats and asymmetric threats.

In March 2015, Freedom completed rough water trials to demonstrate seaworthiness and structural integrity, collecting data while operating in sea states 5 and 6 for 11 days.

He is the father of the Doctor's companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and first appears in the episode \\"Father's Day\\". Writer Paul Cornell incorporated characteristics of his own father whilst writing Pete. This episode reveals that Pete died during Rose's childhood; though she attempts to change her past both she and Pete eventually realise that for the good of humanity he has to die. Rose later takes inspiration from her father in a time of need. Though deceased in Rose's universe, the 2006 series introduces a parallel universe version of Pete who, unlike the original, is rich and successful. Whilst fighting the emotionless Cybermen, Pete loses his wife, the parallel universe Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri), and in turn struggles to comprehend that Rose is his daughter in another universe. This version of Pete returns in the finale episode in which he is there to aid his parallel self's family, eventually returning to the parallel universe with them. He settles down with the original Pete's Jackie and accepts Rose as a surrogate daughter. Appearances The 2005 episode \\"Father's Day\\" in which the character is introduced also establishes the background of Pete; he was born on 15 September 1954 and died on 7 November 1987 when Rose was an infant, after being struck and killed in a hit-and-run. Flashback sequences are shown in which Pete's widow, Jackie (Camille Coduri) tells Rose as a young child (Julia Joyce) that he was a good husband and father and that he died alone. In the present day, Rose asks the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) to take her back in time in his time machine so that she can witness his death and comfort him. When faced with the reality of what she is seeing, Rose impulsively rushes forward and saves Pete from being run down, changing history and causing a temporal paradox. Resultingly, the destructive Reapers arrive and begin to \\"sterilise\\" the wound in time by eradicating everything in sight. Eventually, Pete realises that Rose is his daughter and that her tales of her childhood with him were all lies to cover up the fact he was meant to be dead. Pete chooses to sacrifice himself by deliberately stepping in front of the car that should have killed him thus saving those taken by the Reapers and restoring history. This time, Rose holds his hand whilst he dies so that he does not die alone. Rose invokes her experience of meeting Pete and being there as he died in order to secure Jackie's help in the first series final√© \\"The Parting of the Ways\\". A parallel Earth version of Pete (played again by Dingwall) appears in three episodes of the second series (2006). In this universe, Pete is still alive, and has become rich through his entrepreneurial efforts. However, despite a public front he and Jackie have been effectively separated and have not had children, with Rose instead being the name Jackie has bestowed upon her Yorkshire terrier. Attending Jackie's 40th birthday party, Pete witnesses the first assault of the Cybermen. Though suspected by the Preachers to be one of John Lumic's (Roger Lloyd-Pack) minions, Pete reveals that he is in fact a mole secretly broadcasts them information about Lumic's dealings on an encrypted channel. Along with Rose, who had decided to meet her parallel parents after arriving in the parallel universe, he agrees to infiltrate the Cyber-factory and is horrified to discover that Jackie had been converted into a Cyberman. In the episode's epilogue, Rose tries to tell Pete about her origins, but he is unable to handle this information and slips away to deal with the aftermath of the Cyberman invasion. In the series finale, \\"Doomsday\\", Pete along with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jake Simmonds (Andrew Hayden Smith) is able to travel to the Doctor's universe to help defeat the Cybermen. During the encounter, he is introduced to Rose's universe's Jackie and realises he still has feelings for her. When the walls between universes are sealed Pete and Jackie are sent to the parallel universe for safety; he later returns to rescue Rose from falling into the breach. In the episode's epilogue, it is stated that Jackie is pregnant with his child. Pete does not return with his on screen family in the series four final√© but it is mentioned that he had been looking after his and Jackie's son, Tony. Development Simon Pegg, who ultimately played the Editor in \\"The Long Game\\", was reported as being in line to play Pete, before having to pass on the episode. Paul Cornell, who wrote the episode \\"Father's Day\\" states that he based the character of Pete on his own father, who attempted many different jobs one of which was, like Pete, selling health drinks. In the episode after assuming responsibility for the destructive time paradox, Pete assures Rose \\"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\\". This line was taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. An item of discussion between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose from falling into the void in second series finale \\"Doomsday\\"; executive producer's Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Noel Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise that he had accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter. Reception SFX magazine felt Shaun Dingwall to be the \\"lynchpin\\" of the episode \\"Father's Day\\" and opined that \\"he gives one of the series' best performances.\\" The magazine felt that \\"it was inevitable that Rose's sanitised image of her dad would turn out to be far from the truth\\" but commended the production team \\"for not making him as much of a shit as they could have done.\\" Despite his flaws, SFX concluded that Pete was \\"still immensely likeable.\\" Mark Braxton of the Radio Times also praised Dingwall's \\"unbelievably good\\" performance and stated that this helped distance Pete from being \\"a cut-price Del Boy\\". In his book Who is the Doctor, Graeme Burk reacted negatively toward Pete in \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\"/\\"The Age of Steel\\", feeling that the writers had \\"jettisoned all the subtlety that made us love him in 'Father's Day'\\".

On some releases, they showcase a more thrash and heavy metal influenced sound.  History  Sabbat started in 1983 when a band called Evil consisting of bassist Gezol, guitarists Ozny and Elizaveat, drummer Valvin and vocalist Toshiya was formed. Except for Ozny they had been playing together since 1981 in high school bands like Aburamushi, Hot Rod and Black Beast. With the high school bands they played mostly cover versions of new wave of British heavy metal acts like Iron Maiden and Demon, but with Evil the aim was immediately set higher. The band started to write material of their own and the first gig was played in August 1983. In early 1984, Toshiya left the band and Gezol started to take care of vocals as well. During the summer the foursome decided to make the band a number one priority in their lives and the name of the band changed to Sabbat. The foundation for their history was laid and during the autumn Sabbat delivered their hard, raw and fast metal spiced with Venom covers to the audiences in their hometown of Kuwana and the surrounding area. In April 1985, Sabbat recorded two songs for their first single. The single was released by Gezol's own record label Evil Records and the pressing was 300 copies. In June, Sabbat went through the first line-up change as Gezol's brother Samm (aka Gero) replaced Valvin on drums. In 1986, Sabbat were busy playing gigs throughout Japan which resulted in an appearance at Under The Castle festival on August 3 that was broadcast on television. Less than two weeks later they found themselves in a middle of a crisis. The second night of a two-night gig in Tokyo was played without Ozny who had engaged in an altercation (beating a man who had reportedly given him the finger) after the first night's show. Two weeks later Ozny played one more gig with Sabbat but after that it was mutually agreed that he was out of the band and Sabbat would continue as a trio. In June 1987, Sabbat entered the studio again to record their second 7\\" record entitled Born by Evil Blood. Again the record was released by Evil Records and things looked bright until August came with yet another setback. Because of a death in the family circle Gezol and Samm decided to stop playing live. The farewell show was played in Nagoya on September 13 in front of only 43 people. The decision not to play live was not the end of Sabbat. In October the band was in the studio again and in early 1988 Evil Records released The third 7\\" record entitled Desecration, and a year later The Devil's Sperm Is Cold. With these 7\\" singles and EPs, Sabbat had started to gain popularity also outside Japan and in early 1989 Gezol wanted to return to the limelight. Unfortunately, Elizaveat was not quite as fond of the idea and Samm had already joined Sacrifice. Despite all this, Sabbat played a gig in May with one-night-only line-up: Gezol (bass guitar), Barraveat (guitar), Zorugelion (drums) and Possessed Hammer (vocals). Eventually Gezol succeeded to persuade Elizaveat to play live with Sabbat one more time and the official reunion gig was played October 10 with the following line-up: Gezol (bass guitar/vocals), Elizaveat (guitar) and Zorugelion (drums). Zorugelion was now officially a member of the band replacing Samm permanently on drums. The agreement with Elizaveat was for one show only, so in order to keep on playing live Sabbat had to find a new guitar player. Finding the right person to replace Elizaveat was far from easy and Sabbat did not play a single show in 1990 but the fifth 7\\" record on Evil Records was released. The Seven Deadly Sins EP consisted of three songs recorded with Samm still on drums. Although unwilling to play live, Elizaveat agreed to help Sabbat in the studio until a new guitar player was found. This made it possible for Sabbat to record a demo tape called Sabbatical Demon which is Zorugelion's first studio recording with the band and also Sabbat's only official demo. Almost a year had passed since the reunion gig and there was still no sign of a suitable guitar player. In fact, the two shows played in 1989 were the only shows Sabbat had played during the last three years. Without a new guitarist there would not be any gigs and without any gigs the only sensible option was to go to the studio and this is what Sabbat did in October 1990. With Elizaveat doing the guitars the threesome started to record Sabbat's debut full length album Envenom. The recordings were almost finished when a man called Temis Osmond was discovered and it was soon clear he was the guitar player Sabbat had desperately been looking for. Temis Osmond played a couple of solos on Envenom and although in the album credits he is mentioned only as a special guest he was a full member replacing Elizaveat when the CD came out in 1991 (on Evil Records). After a long struggle with line-up problems Sabbat were suddenly in a most desirable situation. A fresh debut album out and a new line-up: Gezol (bass/vocals), Temis Osmond (guitar/vocals) and Zorugelion (drums). In September 1991, Sabbat flew to Europe to promote the band and make contacts. A gig was planned in Germany but this did not end up happening. There were also plans for an Austrian label, Lethal Records, to release Envenom in Europe but this as well did not end up taking place. In early 1992, it was time to enter the studio again to record the second full length album with Temis Osmond doing all the guitars for the first time. Not only did Temis Osmond play all the guitars but he also shared lead vocals with Gezol. Zorugelion provided some vocals for the album as well. Evoke CD was released in the summer of 1992 by Evil Records. In December 1992, Sabbat were in the studio again in order to record their third album and on top of this Japan's number one underground metal magazine F.E.T.U. released its 13th issue in January 1993 which was dedicated to Sabbat; 33 out of the 36 pages of the magazine were full of Sabbat interviews, pictures and detailed information. The third album Disembody was released by Evil Records in early 1993 but already in the autumn Sabbat were back in the studio again. 1994 was to be the 10th anniversary for the band so a special anniversary album consisting of re-recorded versions of old songs was recorded in autumn 1993. Before this album was released, however, in early 1994 Sabbat recorded the fourth album Fetishism and the CD was swiftly released by Evil Records. Right after Fetishism they released the first part of the anniversary album entitled Black Up Your Soul featuring Elizaveat as a special guest. The 10th anniversary celebrations were marked by a special live show that took place in Nagoya on June 6. During the show the band was joined by special guest stars Samm on drums and Ozny on guitar. Additionally, a record was released outside Japan for the first time. In the autumn of 1994, Holycaust Records, from the United States, released an MCD entitled Sabbatical Devilucifer that consisted of old unreleased demo recordings.

The Bah√° º√≠ World Centre buildings include both the Bah√° º√≠ holy places used for pilgrimage and the international administrative bodies of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith; they comprise more than 20 different administrative offices, pilgrim buildings, libraries, archives, historical residences, and shrines. These structures are all set amidst more than 30 different gardens or individual terraces. The buildings themselves are located in Haifa, Acre, and Bahj√≠, Israel. The location of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre buildings has its roots in Bah√° ºu'll√°h's imprisonment in Acre, which is near Haifa, by the Ottoman Empire during the period of Ottoman rule over Palestine, now Israel. Many Bah√° º√≠ holy places in Haifa and around Acre, including the terraces and the Shrine of the B√°b on the north slope on Mount Carmel, and the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the Mansion of Bahji, and the Mansion at Mazra'ih were inscribed on the World Heritage List in July 2008. The Bah√° º√≠ shrines \\"are the first sites connected with a relatively new religious tradition to be recognized by the World Heritage List.\\"Israeli Baha'i sites recognized by UNESCO Haaretz.com The UNESCO World Heritage Committee considers the sites to be \\"of outstanding universal value [and]...inscribed for the testimony they provide to the Bah√° º√≠'s strong tradition of pilgrimage and for their profound meaning for the faith.\\" Haifa Haifa is the third-largest city in Israel, and it is a seaport, located below and on Mount Carmel, and lies on the Mediterranean coast. In 1891 Bah√° ºu'll√°h himself designated Mount Carmel as the location for the Shrine of the B√°b. Later, Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the Tablet of Carmel wrote that Mount Carmel would be the physical location of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. The Shrine of the B√°b Shrine of the B√°b The Shrine of the B√°b is the location where the B√°b's remains have been finally laid to rest. The location was designated by Bah√° ºu'll√°h himself in 1891 while he was camped, with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, on Mount Carmel. The location is right above the German Colony, which was established in the 1860s by the German Templer Society, who were working for the Kingdom of God on earth. The initial shrine was built by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and completed in 1909. Many years later, the superstructure was completed by Shoghi Effendi, and finally dedicated in 1953. The architect was William Sutherland Maxwell, a Canadian Bah√° º√≠ who was a Beaux-Arts architect and the father-in-law of Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi provided overall guidance, including in the use of Western and Eastern styles, but left the artistic details to Maxwell. Maxwell's design of the Rose Baveno granite colonnade, Oriental-style Chiampo stone arches, and golden dome is meant to harmonize Eastern and Western proportions and style. Some remaining aspects of the dome's structural engineering were designed by Professor H. Neumann of Haifa's Technion University. After Maxwell died in 1952, Leroy Ioas, an American Bah√° º√≠ who had been closely associated with the construction of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois helped Shoghi Effendi in the construction process. Ioas employed his administrative skills and practical mind to supervise the building of the drum and dome, a task done without the availability of sophisticated machinery. Temporary Shrine of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° The Shrine of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° is where  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s is buried. The Arc buildings The Arc composes a number of administrative buildings as revealed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the Tablet of Carmel, built in the shape of an ark which include, the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, the Seat of the International Teaching Centre, the International Bah√° º√≠ Archives and the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts. The fifth building, the International Bah√° º√≠ Library has yet to be built. =Seat of the Universal House of Justice= Seat of The Universal House of Justice. The Seat of the Universal House of Justice is the building located in Haifa, Israel where the Universal House of Justice, the international governing council of the Baha'i community, sits. It is a large building where the House of Justice consults on the affairs of the worldwide community, meet dignitaries and pilgrims, and attends to other business. It also houses a few other offices of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. The building is located at the apex of The Arc and has sixty Corinthian columns around it to mirror the design of the International Archives. The architect was Hossein Amanat and it was completed in 1982 during the second stage of building on the Arc, to be occupied in 1983. During a Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage the Universal House of Justice addresses the pilgrims and then the members greet each pilgrim in turn. =International Teaching Centre Building= The International Teaching Centre Building Built in the third stage of the building of the Arc, the International Teaching Centre Building is where the International Teaching Centre is based. This institution coordinates the growth and protection of the Bah√° º√≠ community. The architect was Hossein Amanat and it was completed in 2001. =Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts= Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts Built in the third stage of the building of the Arc, the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts is the base of the scholars and translators who study and translate the Bah√° º√≠ texts to assist the Universal House of Justice. The architect was Hossein Amanat and it was completed in 1999. =International Archives= The International Archives The International Archives, designed by Mason Remey, is the first building to be built on the Arc and holds many of the most sacred items within the Bah√° º√≠ Faith,The Life of Bah√° ºu'll√°h: Holy Relics but most importantly is built for the viewing of the paintings and drawings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the B√°b, along with a single photograph of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Although some of these items are available on the internet today, most Bah√° º√≠s prefer to see these items only in a reverent atmosphere, during the pilgrimage. Shoghi Effendi chose the Parthenon as the basis for the design, possibly due to the apparent enduring beauty even after thousands of years. The capitals of the fifty columns were Ionic rather than the Doric Order. It was finished in 1957 however Shoghi Effendi never lived to furnish the interior. This was left to his wife R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum. Previously the rear three rooms of the Shrine of the B√°b and then the building beside the Monument Gardens now called the Department of Holy Places were temporary Archives buildings. =International Bah√° º√≠ Library= The International Bah√° º√≠ Library Building specified by Shoghi Effendi is not yet built.Memorandum from the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice Questions about Aspects of the Baha'i Teachings (Item 23: International Bah√° º√≠ Library Building) The Bah√° º√≠ World Centre Library holds an extensive collection of Bah√° º√≠ literature.

The Terraces The Terraces are garden terraces that form nine above and nine below the Shrine of the B√°b on Mount Carmel within Haifa, Israel. Nine concentric circles thus provide the main geometry of the eighteen terraces. Just as the identification of a circle presupposes a centre, so the terraces have been conceived as generated from the Shrine of the B√°b. The eighteen terraces plus the one terrace of the Shrine of the B√°b make nineteen terraces total. Nineteen is a significant number within both the Bah√° º√≠ and B√°b√≠ religions. =The Visitors Centre= The Visitors Centre is an underground structure on the 11th terrace behind the Shrine of the B√°b on Mount Carmel within Haifa, Israel.

The House of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, who was the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith from 1892 to 1921, designed and built a house in Haifa on 7 Haparsim (Persian) Street after his father Bah√° ºu'll√°h died. It was completed in 1908, and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° moved to the house in August 1910. It became his official residence. After his travels to the West, it became the place for the reception of pilgrims to the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. The election of the first Universal House of Justice occurred in this house in 1963. Pilgrim Houses Pilgrim Houses signify buildings where pilgrims are (or were) greeted and housed during pilgrimage to the Bah√° º√≠ holy places. There have been numerous buildings within Haifa, Israel dedicated to this throughout the last century. =Original Western Pilgrim House= The original Western Pilgrim House, located at 4 Haparsim (Persian) Street in Haifa, Israel, was used as a Pilgrim House for members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith of Western origin, who had come for pilgrimage during the early years of the 20th century, before it was replaced by the new Western Pilgrim House on 10 Haparsim Street. The house is currently part of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. While it was originally rented to serve as a Pilgrim House, the house was then bought by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. After being replaced by new Western Pilgrim House, the site was then used by members of the Bah√° º√≠ holy family. It left Bah√° º√≠ hands shortly before being re-bought by the Universal House of Justice. =Second Western Pilgrim House= 10 Haparsim Street The second Western Pilgrim House, often referred to as \\"the old western Pilgrim House\\", located at 10 Haparsim (Persian) Street in Haifa, Israel, was used as a Pilgrim House for members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith who had come for pilgrimage during the first half of the 20th century. It is currently part of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre and used by the Bah√° º√≠ International Community Secretariat and related offices. The house was originally paid for by William Harry Randall, a wealthy American Bah√° º√≠, who felt the facilities of the previous Western Pilgrim House at 4 Haparsim were inadequate. Its construction was started under the instruction of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, but was only completed during the time that Shoghi Effendi was the head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Although it served originally as the Pilgrim House for western Bah√° º√≠s, it has been used for other purposes more recently: *From 1951 to 1963 it housed the International Bah√° º√≠ Council; *From 1963 to 1983 it served as the Seat of the Universal House of Justice; *From 1983 to 2000 it was occupied by the International Teaching Centre. =Eastern Pilgrim House= Haifa Pilgrim House The Eastern Pilgrim House or the \\"Haifa Pilgrim House\\" is a Pilgrim House for Bah√° º√≠s when they go on pilgrimage. The house was built after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° interred the remains of the B√°b on Mount Carmel. The construction of this stone building was supervised by M√≠rz√° Ja ºfar Rahm√°n√≠ of  ªIshq√°b√°d, who also paid all the expenses. It is known as the \\"Eastern Pilgrim House\\", as for decades it housed the Persian pilgrims. After 1951, when the Western Pilgrim House at 10 Haparsim Street became the seat of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, it became the Pilgrim House for all pilgrims. =Old Haifa Pilgrim Reception Centre= Haifa Pilgrim Reception Centre The Pilgrim Reception Centre or the \\"Haifa Pilgrim Reception Centre\\" was the old Pilgrim Reception Centre for pilgrimage to sites near the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. It comprised two conjoined buildings of a historic medical clinic, that had been remodeled and opened in October 2000. While open, the building could serve up to 500 people on pilgrimage. It has now been replaced by a newer Pilgrim Reception Center situated near the Shrine of the B√†b.\\"Reception Center opens for Baha'i pilgrims to the Holy Land\\".

The Resting place of Amatu'l-Bah√° R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum is situated within Haifa, Israel as part of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre. Originally bought to make sure that the area around the House of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was not built up, and used as a garden, it was selected as the burial ground for Amatu'l-Bah√° R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum after she died in 2000. 75 HaTzionut Avenue 75 HaTzionut Avenue is a building within Haifa which is part of the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre that is not particularly celebrated but has been an integral part of the centre for many years.

Akk√° area Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and his family, were exiled to the prison city of Akk√° (Modern day Acre) by the Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz. Bah√° ºu'll√°h arrived in Akk√° on August 31, 1868, and lived the rest of his life in the Akk√° area as a prisoner. His prison conditions were eased in June 1877 and while still a prisoner, he moved to Mazra'ih at that time. The Bah√° º√≠ buildings and property in Akk√° were rented or bought during this period of time. House of  ªAbb√∫d House of  ªAbb√∫d The House of  ªAbb√∫d refers actually to two houses: *The westerly house owned originally by  ªAbb√∫d himself. It was the first property to be rented after Bah√° ºu'll√°h's release from confinement into house arrest. *The easterly house which was owned by  ª√öd√≠ Khamm√°r originally until he let it to the Bah√° º√≠ holy family after a few years.  ª√öd√≠ Khamm√°r also owned the Mansion of Bahj√≠ which the Bah√° º√≠s later acquired. The house provided a home for Bah√° ºu'll√°h's first wife Navv√°b and her family. It was in this building that the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas was written. House of  ªAbdu'll√°h P√°sh√° House of  ªAbdu'll√°h P√°sh√° The House of  ªAbdu'll√°h P√°sh√° is one of the properties the Bah√° º√≠ holy family used in the Akk√° area. It was acquired by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to fit the growing family and also provide space to welcome pilgrims who had started to arrive. The name derives from the Akk√° governor Ibrahim Pasha who owned the house in the early decades of the 19th century. The first western pilgrims were welcomed here on December 10, 1898. The Garden of Ridv√°n Garden of Ridv√°n, Acre The Garden of Ridv√°n (lit. garden of paradise) is a Bah√° º√≠ holy place situated just outside Acre within modern Israel. Originally known as the 'garden of Na ªmayn', it was rented by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° for Bah√° ºu'll√°h where he enjoyed spending the later part of his life, after years in a desolate prison cell. Although it shares the same name it does not have the same significance of the Garden of Ridv√°n, Baghdad and no connection to the festival of Ridv√°n. During the 1930s and 1940s the island setting of the garden disappeared, as a result of a draining project against malaria. In 2010 a three-year restoration and conservation project of the garden and the original water canals surrounding it was completed, after which the Ridvan Garden, referred to by Bah√° ºu'll√°h as 'Our Verdant Isle', became an island once again.BWNS: Holy place restoration sheds light on region's heritage 29 October 2010.

Although the Mansion of Bahj√≠ is relatively isolated, with only a small pilgrim house and the Shrine within several hundred metres, there used to be a complex of several buildings mostly used by the extended Holy family. During the time of Shoghi Effendi, these buildings (and the land around them which are now used as gardens) were bought up or traded for land near the Sea of Galilee. Several of the buildings were demolished as they had been used by covenant breakers. Tiles from the roofs were used to pave the garden pathways, and the material recovered from the razed buildings was used to construct a large windbreak to the northeast of the Mansion. Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h The Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h Located in Bahj√≠, the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h is the most holy place for Bah√° º√≠s -- their Qiblih. It contains the remains of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahj√≠. The Mansion of Bahj√≠ The Mansion of Bahj√≠ The Mansion of Bahj√≠ is the house where Bah√° ºu'll√°h died in 1892. It was built in 1870 over an earlier, smaller building by  ªUdi Khammar, a wealthy merchant from Akk√° who was also the original owner of the House of  ªAbb√∫d. It remained in his family's hands until 1879, when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee. The mansion was subsequently rented to the Bah√° º√≠ holy family for a very small amount of money.  ªUdi Khammar's tomb is still within the main Mansion compound, on the southeast corner of the wall. The Mansion is now a Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage site. Bahj√≠ Visitor Centre Bahj√≠ Visitor Centre Located in Bahj√≠ and near the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the Bahj√≠ Visitor Centre contains basic facilities used by visitors and Bah√° º√≠ pilgrims. Mazra'ih A side view of Mazra'ih. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's quarters can be seen at the top where the walls are plastered. Located four miles (6 km) north of Akk√° in Mazra'a, Bah√° ºu'll√°h used this country house during the summers from June 1877 until 1879, before moving to a larger house within Bahj√≠. It left Bah√° º√≠ hands for several decades and was slightly restructured with an annex added to the front. This meant that a staircase, previously on the outside is now within the house's walls. It originally belonged to  ªAbdu'll√°h P√°sh√°, and is located four miles (6 km) north of Acre. Mazra'ih was transferred from a Muslim waqf to the Bah√° º√≠s subsequent to the establishment of the state of Israel. > \\"Masra'ih is a Moslem religious endowment, and it is consequently > impossible, under existing laws in this country, for it to be sold.

They compete in the Canada Life Premier League and wear a white and navy kit. They play their home games at the Ballafletcher Sports Fields in Douglas at the site of the new Nobles Hospital. History Formed in 1981, as Pot Black F.C. The original club was formed by a group of snooker playing football enthusiasts, led by Pot Black Snooker Centre proprietor, Peter Locke, who used to arrange friendly matches against business teams, such as KPMG and the IOM Police. After a series of friendly matches the players asked Mr Locke to try and gain entry to the Manx FA. The application was placed and was successful. The team, named Pot Black, entered the 2nd division in 1982. When the snooker club was sold, Mr Locke asked the new owners for sponsorship. When none was forthcoming, the club held a meeting in the Theatre Royal Hotel, Wellington Street, Douglas, and voted to change the name of the club to Douglas Royal. In 1986 the club was in some financial difficulties and looked like it may have to fold. A group of like minded young men were looking for a new club and made the offer to help. Fresh sponsorship was available and the club added the number \\"87\\" to its name to celebrate the new start. The original colours were red shirts, with black shorts & socks but the new committee voted to change to the colours worn today. Since those early days, they have won the Hospital Cup once in 2004‚Äì05 when they beat St Georges 3‚Äì2 in the final. Their first season in the First Division was 1989‚Äì90 when they finished sixth. They were relegated to Division Two in the 2002‚Äì03 season, but were promoted back to the top flight the next season as Division Two champions. They were again relegated in the 2007‚Äì08 season and currently play in Division Two They have a reserve team that play in the Isle of Man Football Combination as well as junior and ladies teams. Their main rivals are considered to be Gymnasium.

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League. They wear a blue and white striped shirt, black shorts, black socks and play their home games at Tromode Park in Douglas. History Gymnasium AFC was founded in 1890 by a group of fitness men who wanted to keep fit. They met at the old Douglas Gymnasium and initially played rugby before making the switch to football. Gymns were one of 8 teams that initially made up the official Manx Football League. They have been Isle of Man Football League champions seven times, including four consecutive championships from 1902‚Äì03 to 1905‚Äì06. They have won the Manx FA Cup ten times. The club experienced an internal power struggle during 1987, resulting in the resignation of a section of the committee and players to form spin off club , who even took gymnasiums coloursDouglas Royal, who even copied the Gymns kit of the time and to this day consider themselves rivals (despite being in the lower leagues). In 2001‚Äì02 they were relegated to Division Two but were promoted again the following season as runners-up. However they spent just one season back in the First Division finishing the season winning just two games. And yet again the following season, 2004‚Äì05, they were immediately promoted as runners-up. Since that time the club has consolidated its position within the top tier and continues to climb the table each season. In addition to the Senior team, the club has a reserve team that play in the Isle of Man Football Combination and a Ladies team which plays in the Women's Division One. Plans are being reviewed to create a Youth program within the club to compete at all age groups and it is anticipated that this will be in place for the 2010‚Äì11 season. Thanks to links with a prominent Premier League club, Gymns were donated a playing kit for the 2002‚Äì03 season. Unfortunately a mix- up in communication resulted in blue/white stripe shirts being provided instead of the club's traditional all-white. As a result, Gymns altered the club colours that season to reflect this new kit, later switching the shorts and socks from blue to black and thus creating the home strip worn today. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, the club achieved The Football Association Charter Standard status, the FA's kitemark scheme for quality assurance. The Club then experienced a lean spell and have been back in the second division for a number of years. Gymns have been managed by muppets since 2011, September 2017 aided by Assistant George Crawford, Coach Graeme Sears and Combi Manager Richard Easthope. 2018 / 2019 was another fairly disappointing season but with a few bright moments. The team moved up one place in the table from the previous season and ended on 20 points which was double the tally year before. A rare away win 3-2 at Union Mills after being 2-0 down at Half Time was a highlight as well as a 2-1 win at home to Onchan in the FA Cup with substitute \\"Silent\\" Kev Armstrong scoring a late winner. The team also put up a strong performance in the 2nd round of the Cup going down unluckily 3-1 to Division 2 Champions Pulrose. The main highlight actually came late in the season when Gymns were drawn against the island's top team St George's in the Hospital Cup. Most people forecast a rout especially as the team was missing half a dozen regulars but in fact the team fought hard and played their best football of the season to finish the 90 minutes all square at 2-2. Extra Time was played and it finished 5-3 because ref jon hog gave a goel to St George's after a pure foul to a gyms player then facebooked him after the game to say sorry. later after the ref never took charge of another game again ? (scared of bassy) up and coming out his box keeper Andy Brown pulled off many fine saves over the season and the returning Barry Harding performed well in his few appearances in a defence that was never able to play the same four on a weekly basis. The midfield varied from week to week also but Simon Dixon had his moments and a few goals as well but ex stright guy now out Wesley Gibson was a disappointment. Adam Johnson was again top scorer. The two youngsters in defence Nick Clague (Players Player of the Year) and Ross Crawford (Player/Young Player of the Year) both had fine seasons though and look like good prospects and more decent youngsters are required to build the club up again in future years as well as hopefully bringing in some more experienced talent. We got hammered by Governors Athletic 4-3 and we were 4‚Äì1 down with 75 minutes gone. We only got 2 late goals because of dodgy refereeing GYMS are going to be back so hate us now or hate us later , GTID Partnerships Gymnasium FC continue to be sponsored by Celtic Associates as at the start of the 2019‚Äì20 season. The club is also a member of the Cronkbourne Sports & Social Club, which also includes the Cronkbourne Cricket Club and the Cronkbourne Bacchanalians Hockey Club. This partnership enables the CSSC pavilion facilities to be used during the football season to provide a further level of comfort to home and visiting players.

Clifford the Big Red Dog is an American children's book series about a giant red Labrador retriever named Clifford. It was first published in 1963 and was written by Norman Bridwell (1928‚Äì2014). The series helped establish Scholastic as a premier publishing company, and Clifford is Scholastic's official mascot. Characters * Clifford: A 2-year-old male red dog whose appearance, disposition and behavior are based on a giant dog. His size is inconsistent: While he is often shown being about 25 feet (7.5 m) tall from paws to head, Clifford can appear far larger. The character's name is based on the imaginary childhood friend of creator Norman Bridwell's wife. Bridwell originally wanted to name a dog \\"Tiny\\", but Bridwell's wife persuaded him that \\"Clifford\\" was better. Clifford's pet owner is Emily Elizabeth, and Clifford has a mother, two brothers, and two sisters. Clifford's character was created when a Harper & Row editor advised Bridwell to write a story to go along with one of his pictures. Bridwell recalls she picked out his sketch of a baby girl with a horse-sized bloodhound, and casually said, \\"There might be a story in this\\" because there always was one. * Emily Elizabeth: Clifford's owner and human friend, an 8-year-old girl. She is frequently portrayed riding him like a horse. She was named for creator Norman Bridwell's daughter and based on the imaginary adventures of Bridwell's wife. The TV series adaptation gives her a surname, Emily Elizabeth Howard, and changes the background, with her receiving Clifford as a surprise present on her 6th birthday instead of picking him out as a Christmas present. Adaptations Clifford The Big Red Dog with Laura Bush and children at the White House Easter Egg Roll, 2007. Clifford with then-congressman Tom Tancredo Videos Karl-Lorimar Home Video released the video Clifford's Sing Along Adventure around 1986. Warner Home Video re-released it in the mid-1990s. In 1988, Scholastic Studios, Mendelson-Melendez Productions, Nelvana, Wang Film Productions, and Family Home Entertainment released Clifford's Fun with a videotape series with a theme song composed by Phillip Namanworth and Benjamin Goldstein. The episodes on the release are: The ABC Message Service, Clifford's Birthday Surprise, The Scavenger Hunt, The Rhyme Cat Rescue, Clifford Goes to Hollywood, and The Pet Show. Brent Titcomb was the voice of Clifford, and Alyson Court was Emily Elizabeth. In the late 1990s, a television station from Spain ran the direct- to-video series for a short period of time. Television Scholastic Media produced a 65-episode adaptation shown on PBS Kids, which aired from September 2000 to February 2003. Clifford was voiced by actor John Ritter, and Emily Elizabeth was voiced by Grey DeLisle. There was also a 39-episode prequel series that took place during Clifford's puppyhood where he was voiced by Lara Jill Miller, which ran from September 2003 to February 2006. During that time, a theatrical film which served as the show's finale was released in February 2004 and no new episodes were released after John Ritter's death. However, there is a new series reboot that was released on December 6, 2019 for Amazon Prime Video and December 7, 2019 on PBS Kids with the new voice actors Adam Sanders as Clifford and Hannah Levinson as Emily Elizabeth. They are returning on CBC Kids and CBBC and TG4. Live-action film adaptation In May 2012, it was reported that Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment would make a live-action/CGI animated feature film based on the book. Matt Lopez had been hired to write the script, while Chris Meledandri and Deborah Forte would produce the film. In July 2013, it was reported that Illumination had dropped the project. Two months later, it was reported that the film was still in development at Universal and that there were negotiations to have David Bowers direct the film. Like the 2011 film Hop, Clifford the Big Red Dog will be animated while the other characters will be live-action. On August 1, 2014, Universal scheduled the film for a release on April 8, 2016. In the beginning of 2015, the film's release date was taken over by another Universal film, The Boss. On June 30, 2016, it was reported by Deadline Hollywood that Paramount Pictures had picked up the rights for the film. According to the report, \\"Forte decided to take the material in a new direction,\\" and \\"Universal let the option lapse.\\" It was further announced that Justin Malen was hired to write the screenplay. On September 25, 2017, it was announced that Walt Becker will direct the film, replacing Bowers.\\"7 Days of Deals\\", The Hollywood Reporter, 27 September 2017, page 30. The film will now be produced by Scholastic Entertainment and Paramount Animation. On February 27, 2019, Paramount set the film for a November 13, 2020 release, taking over the slot for the cancelled live-action/CGI Rugrats film. And this will feature a child actress Darby Camp as Emily Elizabeth and a British actor Jack Whitehall as a new character, Uncle Casey, in their lead roles with David Alan Grier providing the animal vocal effects for Clifford. But on August 28, 2020 the film release is pushed back to November 5, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The club was admitted to the Second League and continued to contest the Championship up to the Second World War. In 1928, only six years into their history, the club won the Southern Section of the 2nd League before defeating Michael United 4‚Äì0 in the decider for the Second League Title. At this stage, relegation and promotion had not been incorporated into Manx Football. In the 1933/34 season, they missed out on the title after losing to Peel in a decider, but made amends the following season by clinching their 2nd title. In 1937, Malew made their first appearance in the Junior Cup Final only to be beaten by Rushen United but the following season they won their third Second League title. This was a historic occasion as Malew were the last side to win this trophy before the introduction of relegation & promotion. In 1974, they won the Hospital Cup, defeating favourites Peel 5‚Äì2 in the final. Gordy Lowey scored a hat-trick with brother Alfie scoring the other two.

The term \\"sacbe\\" is Yucatec Maya for \\"white road\\"; white perhaps because there is evidence that they were originally coated with limestone stucco or plaster, which was over a stone and rubble fill.Roys and Shook 1966, 43  Etymology  The word \\"Beh\\" operates as the root term for \\"Sacbe\\" it is a Mayan term for \\"road, pathway, or trail.\\" Beh is spelled alternately as Be, bej, bey, be, bih, as well as \\"beel\\" in the possessive. It has many distinctions from English concepts of roads, pathways, or trails. Beh's metaphoric meanings are just as important if not more important than its literal meaning of \\"road.\\" Ethnographers working the lowlands have noted that it means \\"more than the road you see with your eyes.\\" The term Beh refers to \\"the road of life\\". In the Colonial times \\"Sacbe\\" was translated to calzada which is Spanish for \\"main road/Highway.\\" The literal translation of Sacbe is \\"white road.\\" This is used to refer to Mayan large constructed roads covered in a white (Sac) surfacing.  Sacbeob today  Many sacbeob can be seen by modern visitors to Maya sites; a prominent one is at Chichen Itza, running from the main group around El Castillo to the Sacred Cenote. Few of the longer roads still exist in their entirety. A well known sacbe connects Uxmal with Kabah, which is marked by corbel arches at either end. The 62-mile-long (100 km) road connecting the ancient cities of Coba and Yaxuna was for decades the longest known to archaeologists. The remains of an even longer route have recently received the attention of archaeologists. This long sacbe apparently ran from the site of Ti'ho (modern M√©rida, Yucat√°n), through such sites as Ake and Izamal, to the Caribbean Sea near modern Puerto Morelos, a total distance of some 300 km. In modern times, some of the ancient sacbeob have been used as bases or incorporated into modern highways and railway lines.  Historical use  All sacbeob apparently had ritual or religious significance for pilgrimages.Villa 1934, 207 Travel writer and early Mayanist John Lloyd Stephens reported that some local Maya people in Yucat√°n still said a short ritual prayer when crossing a sacbe in the early 1840s, even though they had been overgrown with jungle for centuries at the time. He is said to have been pleased to have discovered evidence of large, well-constructed sacbeob, reports of which he had previously believed to be exaggerations on the part of the Spanish conquistadores.Koch 2013, 217 Sacbeob had a number of practical uses in addition to any religious significance they may have had. Longer sacbeob could be used for trade and communication. The Maya did not have a beast of burden suitable for carrying goods over long distances, so it is likely that the sacbeob would have been regularly walked by traders, though the Maya are also known to have used water routes.Northrup et al. 2004, 612 There is a wealth of evidence of mounds, often interpreted as remains of huts or way stations for travelers, along large sacbeob.Coe and Coe 1939, 377 Looking at the large sacbe connecting Kabah to Uxmal, natives told John Lloyd Stephens that ancient Mayan couriers used the sacbeob to deliver messages between large cities. At Ake in the Yucat√°n, several sacbeob lead directly to cenotes, which serve both as important religious sites and sources of clean water. At Coba, there are more than 50 sacbeob still visible today. Some researchers believe that some of the sacbeob were used to divide the population of about 55,000 people into at least four barrios or neighborhoods.Folan 1978, 73 Many smaller sacbeob fall in places around sources of water or other high-traffic areas like ceremonial or administrative centers. Two much larger sacbeob connect Coba to the smaller sites of Yaxuna, almost 100 km to the west, and Ixil, about 20 km to the southwest. Since Coba is the only major Classic Period site in a 5,000 square kilometer area around it, Yaxuna and Ixil are believed to be outposts or subsidiaries of Coba, which would have been the capital of the state in which they all resided.Folan 1978, 73-74 Some sacbeob that have been studied in the northwest Yucatan seem to have been constructed at times of conflict, rapid population growth and migration, and they have been interpreted by some as \\"permanent markers attesting to the relationships between dominant centers and satellite settlements,\\" effectively a way of signifying and maintaining political boundaries.Kurjack and Andrews 1976, 322-324 While the sacbeob in the Yucat√°n are the best known, they are documented elsewhere in the Maya area. A number of sacbeob have been found around El Mirador and Tikal in the northern Pet√©n Basin and around Copan in the southern Guatemalan Highlands, as well as at other sites.Wahl et al. 2007, 213Sharer 2001  Cosmic and ceremonial reference  Within the Maya, movement holds a ceremonial and spiritual power. In Maya Healing, some forms of illness are diagnosed through concepts of the movement of various forces through the body and the world. Rituals include curing the sick, pilgrimage, procession, and dedication involve movement as a generative source of power, capable of change and influence. The present day and colonial Maya term for the Milky Way is also \\"sacbe.\\" The fulfillment of one's destiny is considered the fulfillment of their \\"road.\\" Seeing that movement, roads, and the cosmos are important to Mayan mythos, the conflation of Sacbe with the celestial Milky Way suggests a ceremonial importance of the Sacbe.

It is based on the 1933 Takigawa incident. The film stars Setsuko Hara, Susumu Fujita, Takashi Shimura and Denjir≈ç ≈åk≈çchi. Fujita's character was inspired by the real-life Hotsumi Ozaki, who assisted the famous Soviet spy Richard Sorge and so became the only Japanese citizen to suffer the death penalty for treason during World War II. The film is in black-and-white and runs 110 minutes. Plot The film begins in 1933. Students at Kyoto Imperial University protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Prominent professor Yagihara (Denjiro Okochi) is relieved of his post because of his views against fascism. The professor's daughter Yukie (Setsuko Hara) is courted by two of her father's students: Ryukichi Noge (Susumu Fujita) and Itokawa (Akitake K√¥no). Itokawa is equable and moderate while Noge is fiery and a radical leftist. Although she fights with him vigorously, Yukie is eventually drawn toward Noge. Noge disappears following an anti-militarist student protest, the result of being arrested and spending four years in jail. By the time Itokawa, now a prosecutor for the government, tells Yukie of Noge's whereabouts, he has been out of jail for a year. He warns her that he is a changed man and no longer how Yukie remembered him. Itokawa brings Noge over to the Yagihara residence. During dinner, Professor Yagihara mentions that Noge would not have been released unless the government was convinced that Noge had \\"converted\\" from his radical ways. Noge confirms this and says that Itokawa vouched for him and had even found him a job in the army. After realizing that Noge has changed from his days at university, Yukie excuses herself from the dinner table and locks herself in her room. Her mother eventually tells her that the young men are leaving. Yukie is reluctant to see them out, but once her mother tells her that Noge is leaving for China she decides to see Noge one last time to say goodbye. After Noge's departure, Yukie begins to pack for Tokyo and has a deep conversation with her father. For three years in Tokyo, Yukie works in menial jobs to get by. One day she runs into Itokawa and is told that Noge is in the city. She goes to Noge's offices, but is reluctant to reconnect. Yukie is shown outside of the offices several times until eventually Noge notices her. They spend several years together and get married. Yukie discovers that Noge is involved in dangerous and illegal activities, but they agree that she should not know exactly what they are. Noge is arrested the night before his plans are to go into effect. Yukie is interrogated, but she proffers no information. She is treated badly during the interrogations but Itokawa is eventually able to free her. Her parents take the train into Tokyo where Yukie's father meets up with Itokawa, thanks him for what he has done and informs him that he intends to represent Noge in court. Itokawa mournfully responds that Noge died the night before. Yukie is crushed. She brings his ashes to his parents, farmers in the countryside, and tells them she is his wife. Noge's father rejects her, believing that she has come to mock them because their son was convicted of being a spy but Yukie stays and works the rice fields with them. They are scorned and harassed in their village, and Yukie tries to convince them of her sincerity and that their son was a good man. The work in the rice fields is hard on her, but she is determined to prove her mettle, even to the point of working through a severe fever. The night that Yukie and her mother-in-law finally finish planting all of the fields, the neighbors sneak in and destroy their work. When Yukie mourns the vandalism, Noge's father finally accept her and their son is redeemed in their eyes. At the end of the war, Professor Yagihara is reinstated and Noge is honored for his antiwar efforts. Yukie returns to Kyoto to visit her parents. Yukie's mother invites her to stay since it seems her daughter has achieved her goal: Noge's parents are no longer ashamed of their son. However, Yukie now feels more comfortable planting rice than playing the piano, and sees the value in the social work that still must be done in the village so she returns to Noge's parents.

The station broadcasts at a power of 100 kW. Its transmitter is located on 225th Street in rural LeClaire in Scott County. KMXG is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., with studios located in Davenport, Iowa. Other stations located in the same complex are KUUL-FM, WLLR-FM, KCQQ-FM, WFXN and WOC. History=Early history (1947‚Äì1986) KMXG originally had studios in Clinton and was co-owned with KROS 1340 AM. At that time, 96.1 had the call letters KROS-FM and later KSAY. During its run as KROS-FM, the station acted as a repeater for the AM signal, and later formatted beautiful music, much like other FM stations of the day. During its years in Clinton, KSAY operated as a religious station serving primarily the Gateway area (Clinton and Jackson counties in Iowa; Whiteside and Carroll in Illinois) from 1974 until 1986. During this time, a February 1985 fire that struck the building where the studios for KSAY and KROS were located knocked the station off the air for several days; when the station returned to the air in a new studio, the first program was a two-hour show devoted to the fire and volunteers that helped get KROS-KSAY back on the air. Adult contemporary era (1986‚Äìpresent) Upon 96.1 FM's move to the Quad Cities, the station was known as KLIO-FM (K-Lite) and formatted adult contemporary music. The call letters changed several years later to KMJC (\\"Magic 96\\") in November 1989 before adopting the current KMXG (\\"Mix 96\\") call sign in July 1993. Starting in 2008, during the holiday season, Mix 96 switches to an all-holiday music format. =Weekend programming= Sometime during the 2000s, KMXG began programming a \\"retro Saturday\\" block of music, focusing on hits of the 1980s with some hits from the 1970s and early 1990s mixed in. Syndicated programming added included Backtrax USA (both the 1980s and 1990s versions), Retro Pop Reunion and American Top 40: The 80s. With the demise of KUUL-FM's oldies format in 2012, several of KUUL's former programs were added to KMXG's weekend lineup, including American Top 40: The 70s, Into the 70s with John Landecker and The 70s with Steve Goddard. As such, Saturdays are devoted to 1980s and 1990s music, while Sundays feature music of the 1970s. For nearly two years, until format changes to classic hits and adult hits at WYEC and KQCS, respectively, KMXG's weekend programming was the only regularly scheduled classic hits radio programming, featuring music of the 1970s through 1990s, available in the Quad-Cities market. Continuing on Sundays were two three-hour blocks of smooth jazz music: \\"Jazz Patio\\" and \\"Smooth Jazz Sunday Night,\\" both hosted by Art Monroe. Jazz music has been a staple of 96.1 FM since at least its incarnation as KLIO, with different hosts through the years.

Dutton, and Courtney Chase. Taking place in real time, the film follows a public accountant who must assassinate a politician in exchange for his kidnapped daughter's freedom. It was released theatrically on 22 November 1995. Plot The film opens with Gene Watson (Johnny Depp), a mild-mannered, separated accountant, arriving with his daughter Lynn at the Union Station in Los Angeles. As Watson makes a pay phone call informing an unidentified person that his train was late, two mysterious strangers in suits, known only as Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia), survey the station from a catwalk, discussing a yet-to-be-elaborated scheme. Noticing Watson retaliate against a skater who was harassing his daughter, Smith and Jones set their sights on him and swiftly approach the pair. Showing a badge, the two strangers convince Watson that they are police officers and whisk both father and daughter into a van without justification. Once in the vehicle, Watson begins to notice things are not right and gets nervous, but Smith subsequently pistol whips him in the leg to get his attention. Smith then informs Watson that they will kill his daughter by 1:30 p.m. unless he murders a woman depicted in a photograph. He soon learns that the woman is State Governor Eleanor Grant and realizes that killing her would be a suicide mission. Once at the Bonaventure Hotel, where a number of campaign appearances are being held, Watson makes several attempts to warn people about his situation, but Smith consistently follows him around, taunts and viciously beats him whenever he does not make a move. Watson manages to find a young campaign assistant, Krista Brooks, who believes Watson's story and encourages him to report the matter to the governor's husband, Brendan Grant. Once in his suite, however, Brendan and a campaign lobbyist appear to disbelieve the story, and before anything more can be said, Smith shows up in the room and fatally shoots Krista, causing a tense scuffle between Watson and Smith. Watson awakens after unconsciousness and finds nearly everyone on the campaign, including the governor's staff and husband, are involved in the plot, with an unnamed right- wing lobbyist masterminding it all in revenge for the governor not carrying out her campaign promises to his interests. Watson eventually finds a disabled war veteran named Huey who polishes people's shoes at the hotel. While at first he does not believe Watson's story, Smith talks to Watson about the plot, believing Huey to be completely deaf according to a sign. Huey reluctantly assists Watson to get to Governor Grant's suite and advise her of the conspiracy. Although skeptical at first of Watson's story, she later notices Brendan act suspiciously about Krista's whereabouts and realizes Watson was telling the truth. Being hastened by her husband to make the last speech, the governor greets supporters in a ballroom when Watson takes out the gun, points it at a projector room where Smith is watching him and shoots at the window. This unleashes a panic in the ballroom, causing a stampede and brief shootout between Watson and the security people. Thinking that his wife is dead, Brendan openly gloats about the plot's success, only to find out in horror that she had heard everything, confirming her suspicions about him. In the meantime, Huey stalls the armed Jones, who is in the van with Watson's daughter after she cannot get a signal from Smith. He then annoys her with a squeegee man scheme to the point of a violent confrontation in which she shoots his wooden leg. Lynn quickly tries to get out of the van when Smith opens the door and begins to shoot at her. Right after she hides under the seat, Watson appears and shoots Smith. Ailing from his wounds, Smith congratulates Watson for becoming a killer just before he's finally killed by Watson. Before Jones can get a clear shot at the father and daughter, Huey beats her unconscious with his prosthetic leg and wing tip shoe. The final scene shows the conspiracy mastermind stepping on Watson's broken wristwatch and leaving the hotel in a car. An alternate TV scene (and on some DVD versions) also shows the governor thanking Watson and Huey for saving her life. Cast * Johnny Depp as Gene Watson * Christopher Walken as Mr. Smith * Charles S.

It runs near Saginaw and Midland in the Tri-Cities area of the Lower Peninsula. The highway runs through suburban and agricultural areas to connect the two cities with the airport in the area. The northernmost section of M-47 runs along a freeway to the terminus at US Highway 10 (US 10). M-47 runs for , all of which has been listed as a part of the National Highway System. First designated by July 1, 1919 along a different routing, M-47 was extended several times in both directions through the 1920s and 1930s. Two of these extensions replaced sections of M-111 in the Bay City area. At the apex of its length in the 1950s, M-47 stretched from Webberville in the south to Bay City State Park in the north. Since Interstate 75 (I-75) opened in the Tri-Cities area, the northern section of M-47 was rerouted and truncated as a result of related changes to other highways. The southern end was moved after I-96 opened in the Lansing area. Further changes into the 1970s shortened M-47 more, producing the routing in use today. Route description M-47 starts at M-46 (Gratiot Road) east of Shields next to the Oakwood Cemetery. M-47 is known as Midland Road as it runs slightly northwest to intersect with M-58 (State Road) in Saginaw Charter Township running parallel to the Tittabawassee River. This area is the western edge of Saginaw's suburbs. Along the road towards Freeland, there are periodic small farms in between small residential subdivisions. In the community of Freeland, M-47 runs near the MBS International Airport off Freeland Road. North of town, M-47 leaves Midland Road and becomes a freeway near Tittabawassee Park. The freeway section of M-47 runs through rural farm land. There is a diamond interchange with Salzburg Road before the terminal interchange at US 10. As part of its maintenance duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic on the highways it maintains. This number is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average traffic for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, the department measured a peak of 19,719 vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawassee Road. The section south of the US 10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9,315 vehicles AADT. Additionally, the entire route of M-47 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History The original designation of M-47 was routed from the Shiawassee‚ÄìIngham county line north to St. Charles and then east along M-46 into Saginaw. A southern extension into Ingham County to end at M-16 in Williamston was transferred and completed in 1924. A northern extension to Bay City replaced a section of M-111 in 1929, and extended farther to Bay City State Park in 1933. M-47 replaced the remainder of M-111 and extended southward from the park to Bay City in 1938, creating a \\"U-turn\\" in the routing. The southern terminus was moved again in late 1951 or early 1952 to Webberville, although still ending on US 16. At its greatest extent in the 1950s, the highway extended north from Webberville through Owosso and St. Charles to a junction with M-46 between Hemlock and Shields. M-47 turned east along M-46, running concurrently with that highway to Saginaw Township. There M-47 turned north independently to a junction with US 10, and then ran concurrently with US 10 into Saginaw. Once in the city, M-47 turned north along Bay Street out of town toward Bay City. M-47 joined US 23 and followed it north of town. M-47 then ran separately to the state park before turning south and back into downtown Bay City, ending at the US 23 business loop. Major changes to the routing of M-47 started in December 1960 when the I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway opened between Saginaw and Bay City. US 10 was rerouted east of Midland to Bay City along the M-20 freeway. M-47 was rerouted along the former US 10 from Saginaw to east of Midland using a connector expressway from Freeland north to the US 10 freeway. M-81 was extended over State Street in Saginaw, and the former routing of M-47 between Saginaw and Bay City was redesignated as M-84. M-13 also replaced the former US 23/M-47 when US 23 was moved to freeways as well. The southern end of M-47 was changed in 1962 with the completion of I-96 in the Lansing area. US 16 was replaced by M-43, and the southern terminus of M-47 was moved to exit 122 along I-96. This segment of M-47 south of M-46 became an extension of M-52 in 1969, truncating M-47 to Hemlock. The interchange at Salzburg Road north of Freeland opened in 1970, and the expressway segment was upgraded to a full freeway. At the same time, M-47 was truncated to its current routing, resulting in the elimination of the M-46/M-47 concurrency near Shields. In the end, only about a mile and a half (2.4 km) of roadway still bears the M-47 from before the changes made starting in 1960, along a section of road that was not originally part of the highway in 1919. In June 2014, a construction project began on the interchange with US 10 at the route's northern terminus. This construction consisted of bridge replacement over US 10, as well as a new ramp connecting northbound M-47 to westbound US 10 that, unlike the old ramp, does not conflict with westbound traffic exiting onto southbound M-47. M-111 In 1928, M-111 was assigned to a route connecting M-13 (later signed as US 23 for a time) north of Bay City to Bay City State Park on Saginaw Bay. The original route consisted of what is today Euclid Avenue. In the early 1930s, a return leg towards Bay City was added to the east of the original route along what is now State Park Road, giving the route an upside- down-U shape. In 1933, the western leg along Euclid Avenue from Midland Road to Beaver Road was designated as M-47. In 1938, all of M-111 was re-designated as M-47‚Äîthus making M-47 double back to Bay City.

Introduced to the world of the theatre, the three brothers broke the monopoly on the theatre-management industry (represented by the Theatrical Syndicate under Abe Erlanger) and Mark Klaw in the foundation of rival agency the Shubert Organization, replacing it with their own. Among the organization's Manhattan holdings are the renowned Winter Garden Theatre (at 1634 Broadway), the Sam S. Shubert (at 221 West 44th Street), and the Imperial Theatres. By 1924 they had 86 theatres in the United States. By 1953 they had produced 600 shows under their credits and had booked 1,000 shows into their numerous theatres. By the 1920s, they owned, operated, managed or booked over 1,000 theatres nationwide.\\"The Shubert Organization\\" shubertorganization.com, accessed August 29, 2009 In 1942 they owned, leased or managed 20 of New York City's approximately 40 legitimate theatres and controlled some 15 in other cities.Times Wire Services. \\"The Curtain Falls for J.

The organization also owns and operates the 5-stage Off-Broadway facility, New World Stages. Jerry Stagg identifies Lee Shubert as the key creative partner, showing how he built the most successful theatrical empire in history. Stagg characterizes the trio as vulgar and uneducated , but acknowledges that they made a personal monopoly amassing millions of profits in the process. They opened new theater districts in many major American cities, employing thousands over the years. Entertainment and popular taste was the goal, rather than the dramatic arts. By 1924, they controlled 75 percent of all American theaters, producing 25 percent of all plays. Their actors in response created Actor's Equity as a labor union to counterbalance their power. When the Great Depression caused the bankruptcy of their corporate empire in 1933, they could have retired wealthy. Instead they kept the theater alive pouring their own money into the gamble. Almost alone they kept the legitimate theater alive in America. The federal government called them a monopoly, and in 1950 they were taken to court by the federal government. In 1955 Supreme Court ruling ruled that they were subject to antitrust laws, so they sold 12 theaters in six cities and give up the booking business there was the heart of their enterprise.Jerry Stagg, The Brothers Schubert (1968) Some notable shows Musical comedies; *Chinese Honeymoon (1902) *Winsome Winnie (1903) *The Babes and the Baron (1905) *The Dancing Duchess (1914) Revues; *Pioneer Days (1906) featuring Indians, cavalry, baby elephants, and chorus girls. dir.

Mount Benson is one of six wine growing regions that are located in the Limestone Coast wine zone. History The region's first grapes were planted in the 1980s by local farmers well attuned to Mount Benson's climatic conditions. These grapes would later make way for the region's own style of delicate, cool-climate, maritime-influenced wines. Viticulture and climate The Mount Benson vineyards are planted on gently undulating terrain ranging from five to 50 metres above sea level and attracted the interest of viticulturalists due to prevalent loam-based terra rossa soils that sit atop free-draining limestone, which formed over millions of years while the region was underwater. Shells and skeletal remains of marine animals deposited on the shallow sands of what is now the Limestone Coast, and under the ocean's weight these remains fused together to form a layer of soft limestone. Terra rossa soil, arguably the most famous vineyard soil in Australia, is produced as the limestone weathers and the clay contained in the rocks is left behind. Where this clay sits above the water table oxidation occurs, forming rust and giving the soil is characteristic red colour. A moderate maritime climate is ideal from a viticultural point of view. Cold and wet winters and long, cool and dry growing seasons are typical in the region. Strong winds prevailing from the south in spring and summer keep foliage dry and disease at bay. Winter frosts are moderated by the coastal location, as are summer temperature extremes. These conditions provide the foundation to an elegant and delicate style of wines. * Map coordinates: 36.97¬∞S, 139.72¬∞E * Altitude: 5-150m * Heat Degree Days (Oct-Apr): 1443.7 * Average annual rainfall: 483.2mm * Growing Season rainfall: 170.5mm * Mean January maximum: 24.6 ¬∞C * Relative humidity (Oct-Apr, 3pm): 58% * Harvest: late February ‚Äì early May Mount Benson is home to five cellar doors, each showcasing wine varieties which express Mount Benson's coastal locality and soils.

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League and they wear a blue and white kit, and a change strip of all red. They play their home games at the Ballacloan Stadium in Ramsey. History Formed in 1885, they are the oldest and one of the most successful clubs in the Isle of Man Football League. Much of that success though came in the last part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century. They have been crowned Isle of Man champions eleven times and won the Manx FA Cup 18 times. The club's first trophy came in 1891‚Äì92 when they shared the Manx FA Cup with Peel. They won the cup again the following two seasons. They were Isle of Man champions for four consecutive years between 1898‚Äì99 and 1901‚Äì02, winning the league six more times before World War II. Their last championship came in the 1951‚Äì52 season. Ramsey were relegated to Division Two in the 1985‚Äì86 season finishing bottom of the league. They were promoted back to the top flight though before being relegated again in 1990‚Äì91. The following season they finished as runners-up in Division Two and were promoted back to the First Division. However, they were relegated straight back down in the 1992‚Äì93 season. In 2000‚Äì01 they were promoted again, finishing as runners- up to Ayre United only to be relegated once again the following season. They continued their roller coaster ride between the leagues with promotion again the following season as Division Two champions. They also won both the Paul Henry Gold Cup, beating St Johns United 2‚Äì1 in the final and the Woods Cup, beating Union Mills 2‚Äì0 in the final In 2003‚Äì04 they won the Manx FA Cup, beating Castletown in the final on penalties. They currently play in the Premier League. They also have a big junior setup, which consists of an Under 11's A+B, Under 13's, Under 15's and Under 17's.

It marked a return to cinema for Fonda, being her first film since Stanley & Iris in 1990. The film was negatively received by critics who praised Fonda but panned the screenplay. Monster-in-Law was a box office success, grossing $154 million on a $43 million budget. Plot Charlie Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) is a temp/dog walker/yoga instructor and aspiring fashion designer from Venice Beach, California, who meets doctor Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan). At first, she thinks he's gay because of a lie his vindictive ex-girlfriend Fiona (Monet Mazur) told her. But then Kevin asks her out and she believes that she has finally found the right man. Things start to sour when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola (Jane Fonda), a former newscaster turned talk show host, who has recently been replaced by a younger woman, causing her to have a meltdown and attack a guest on-air. Loathing Charlie immediately, Viola becomes more distraught when Kevin proposes to her; fearing she'll lose her son the same way she lost her career. She sets out to ruin Kevin and Charlie's relationship, enlisting the help of her loyal assistant Ruby (Wanda Sykes). Viola fakes an anxiety attack and moves in with Charlie while Kevin is away for a medical conference, in an attempt to drive her crazy with her antics. Charlie soon catches onto Viola's plan and fights back by destroying her bedroom and tampering with her anti- psychotic medication (which Viola had replaced with Vitamin C tablets). Charlie eventually confronts Viola, forcing her to move out. Finding no way to stop the wedding, Viola tricks Charlie into eating nuts during the rehearsal dinner, causing an extreme allergic reaction which results in Charlie‚Äôs face swelling up. However, the swelling subsides by morning. On the day of the wedding, Viola turns up wearing a white dress instead of the peach-coloured one Charlie had specially made for her. This leads to a violent standoff between the two, with Viola refusing to accept Charlie and stating she'll never be good enough for Kevin. Suddenly, Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevin's grandmother Gertrude (Elaine Stritch), appears and they have an indignant argument with Gertrude holding Viola responsible for the ‚Äúterminal disappointment‚Äù, from which Gertrude claims her son, Kevin‚Äôs father, died many years ago. Gertrude's resentment of Viola bears a strong resemblance to Viola's feelings of animosity towards Charlie, who decides to back down as she feels the same thing will happen to them in 30 years. Charlie leaves to tell Kevin that the wedding is off to save his relationship with his mother. But before that can happen, Ruby approaches Viola and tells her that her efforts against Charlie to make Kevin happy are unwarranted. Viola ultimately realizes that she wants Charlie to stay and tells her that she will leave the two of them alone if that means her son is happy. Charlie, however, tells Viola that she wants her to be a part of their lives, with some boundaries and ground rules. Charlie and Kevin get married and, when Charlie throws her wedding bouquet, Viola (now wearing the peach-coloured dress) catches it. As Charlie and Kevin drive away to their honeymoon, the film ends with Viola and Ruby walking out of the celebration to go out drinking.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"While Jane Fonda steals the movie in her return to the screen, a tired script and flimsy performances make this borderline comedy fall flat.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one out of possible four stars, saying: \\"You do not keep Jane Fonda offscreen for 15 years, only to bring her back as a specimen of rabid Momism. You write a role for her. It makes sense. It fits her. You like her in it. It gives her a relationship with Jennifer Lopez that could plausibly exist in our time and space. It gives her a son who has not wandered over after the \\"E.R.\\" auditions. And it doesn't supply a supporting character who undercuts every scene she's in by being more on-topic than any of the leads.\\" Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal also panned the movie, and used his review to deride the state of big-budget film-making, writing: \\"Films like this ... are emblematic of Hollywood's relentless dumbing-down and defining-down of big-screen attractions. There's an audience for such stuff, but little enthusiasm or loyalty. Adult moviegoers are being ignored almost completely during all but the last two or three months of each year, while even the kids who march off to the multiplexes each weekend know they're getting moldy servings of same-old, rather than entertainments that feed their appetite for surprise and delight.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle was one of the few critics who gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"It's a crude, obvious comedy, which occasionally clunks, but it's often very funny, as well as being a really shrewd bit of popular entertainment. Its appeal resides in a lot of things, not the least of which is a sophisticated awareness of what an audience brings to it.\\" The film ran 849 sneak preview screenings on Mother's Day at 4pm, the Sunday before release. New Line's president of domestic distribution David Tuckerman publicly stated his doubts about this strategy but the film achieved 90% attendance and he stated \\"the marketing department hit a home run.\\" The film became a box-office success debuting at number #1 at the box office during its first weekend and earning $24 million. By the end of its run, the movie earned $83 million at the domestic box office and a worldwide total of $154.7 million, against an estimated production budget of $43 million. Lopez earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress for her performance in the film, but lost to Jenny McCarthy for Dirty Love. Home media  The two-disc set DVD was released on August 30, 2005 with these features: Audio Commentary, 7 Deleted Scenes, a Blooper Reel, and 4 Featurettes: # \\"Welcome Back Jane\\" # \\"A Jennifer of All Trades\\" # \\"Vartan the Man\\" # \\"Trendsetters\\" (2 Parts) TV series On October 13, 2014, it was reported that the Fox Broadcasting Company is developing a TV show based on the film with Amy B.

It is a very high honour, second only after the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur (Legion of Honour). Very few people, military units and communes were ever awarded it; and only for their deeds during World War II. A different order, the M√©daille de la R√©sistance (\\"Resistance Medal\\"), was created and awarded for lesser but still distinguished deeds by members of the Resistance.  History  The Order of Liberation was established by General de Gaulle in order n¬∞ 7, signed in Brazzaville on November 16, 1940. The object of the Order was to \\"reward people, of the military or civilian communities, who will have distinguished themselves in the task of liberating France and her Empire\\". There were no restrictions as to age, sex, rank, origin or nationality; nor any regarding the nature of the deeds, other than their exceptional quality. The Order has a single rank, the title of Compagnon de la Lib√©ration (\\"Companion of the Liberation\\"). General de Gaulle, founder of the Order, was the only Grand Ma√Ætre (\\"Grand Master\\") of the Order. The Order was usually bestowed by the traditional French military ceremony of \\"prise d'armes\\". The recipient was summoned forward by rank and name, and given the insignia while being commended thus: Nous vous reconnaissons comme notre Compagnon pour la lib√©ration de la France dans l‚Äôhonneur et par la Victoire (‚ÄúWe acknowledge you as our companion for the Liberation of France, in honour and by Victory‚Äù). The last awards to French citizens, units and communes were made on 23 January 1946. Awards to foreign nationals were made until 1960.  Award description  The medal of the Order is called the Croix de la Lib√©ration (\\"Cross of Liberation\\"). It is a 31 mm wide by 33 mm high rectangular bronze shield bearing a 60 mm high vertical gladius on its obverse. On the blade of the gladius: a black enamelled Cross of Lorraine (symbol of the Free French Forces). On the reverse, in Latin: a relief inscription in bold letters on four rows, PATRIAM SERVANDO VICTORIAM TULIT (\\"By serving the Fatherland, he/she achieved Victory\\"). The award is suspended by a rectangular loop through the hilt of the gladius to a 36 mm wide silk moir√© green ribbon with 4 mm wide black edge stripes and 1 mm wide black longitudinal stripes, 11 mm from the edges. Green represents hope, black represents mourning, symbolizing the state of France in 1940. The ribbon at first had diagonal black stripes, but the Order was only awarded in that form during August‚ÄìSeptember 1942.  Recipients  The individuals, units and communities listed below were awarded the Order of Liberation A total of 1061 Crosses of Liberation were awarded: * 1038 to individuals; * 18 to units of the Army, Air Force and Navy; * Five to cities: Nantes, Grenoble, Paris, Vassieux-en-Vercors, and l‚Äô√éle de Sein.  Individual recipients  Amongst the 1036 Companions of the Order, 65 were killed before the end of the war (8 May 1945) and another 260 received the distinction posthumously. Members of the French resistance, especially the more famous ones, often received the Order under their nom de guerre. Six women were awarded the title: * Berty Albrecht, co-founder of the movement Combat, who died in the prison of Fresnes in 1943 * Laure Diebold, liaison agent of the \\"Mithridate\\" network and secretary to Jean Moulin, deported. * Marie Hackin, died at sea in February 1941 on a mission * Marcelle Henry of the VIC escape network, died shortly after returning from deportation * Simone Michel-L√©vy, of the Postmen Resistance, died while deported * √âmilienne Moreau-Evrard, hero of the First World War, agent for the \\"Brutus\\" network and later member of the Assembl√©e Consultative Provisoire Nearly 10% of the recipients of the Order were younger than 20 at the beginning of the war. The youngest, Mathurin Henrio, was 14 when he was shot dead by Nazi officers for refusing to answer questions on the whereabouts of Maquisards. The Order was re-opened twice to honour foreign personalities who helped liberate France: * Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill (1958) * King George VI (1960, posthumously) File:Andr√© Bollier.JPGResistance fighter Andr√© Bollier, a posthumous recipient of the Order of Liberation File:Pierre Clostermann.jpgFighter ace Pierre Clostermann, a recipient of the Order of Liberation File:Dwight D.

Tyrants are towering, biologically engineered supersoldiers created and used by the sinister Umbrella Corporation. Tyrant creatures make appearances as boss characters in most Resident Evil games and the desire to create an obedient bioweapon lies at the core of the series' storyline. Tyrants also appear in other media and merchandise of the Resident Evil franchise, as well as in some unrelated games. Since their debut, the Tyrant series became one of the most recognisable and popular characters of the franchise. A particularly notable Tyrant is Nemesis, the title character of the video game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Character design Capcom artists went through a trial-and-error process designing the Tyrant creatures and their transformations. For example, the T-103 (more popularly known as \\"Mr. X\\"Jesse Schedeen, Resident Evil: The Many Looks of the Infected, IGN, September 14, 2011. and sometimes also as \\"Trenchcoat\\") was originally envisioned as armed with firearms; in some sketches it can be seen wearing a respirator and various armored outfits instead of a trenchcoat (there were also other types of coats, including a labcoat), and even its overall physical build has varied greatly (from very slim to extremely muscular).Capcom, Resident Evil Archives, BradyGames 2005 (page 216). The only consistent attribute of most Tyrant creature variations seems to be their large, exposed beating hearts which usually serve as their only vulnerable area. Appearances=In video games The game series features many types of Tyrants as the result of several different experiments. Following the discovery of the Progenitor virus, the Umbrella Corporation‚Äôs founders become eager to create a Bio-Organic Weapon (BOW) that is both powerful and capable of following orders. Prior to the events of Resident Evil Zero, Umbrella used the Progenitor virus to create the Tyrant virus (T-virus), which they believe can be used to manufacture powerful organisms. A problem with the virus‚Äô compatibility with humans set the project back, as only humans with a very rare genetic makeup are capable of mutating into potent and manageable life forms; only one in a million people are estimated to be compatible. Umbrella eventually overcame this setback by resorting to using clones of Sergei Vladimir, one of their executives who happens to be genetically compatible. These mass-produced Tyrants were given the label, T-103. The events of Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil chronicle the Umbrella Corporation's development of the Tyrant prototypes, the T-001 (the Proto-Tyrant) and T-002. Though the early Tyrants are defeated in their first encounters, Umbrella manages to use the battle data from those defeats to produce other, more efficient Tyrants in the later installments of Resident Evil. Numerous Tyrants have been created throughout the game series' storyline, such as Tyrant T-078 and the mass-produced Bandersnatches from Resident Evil Code: Veronica, Hypnos from Resident Evil Survivor, Thanatos from Resident Evil Outbreak and Tyrant R from Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 each with its own defining characteristics.Jesse Schedeen, Resident Evil: The Many Looks of The Tyrant, IGN, March 6, 2009. A revamped version of Tyrant also existed in Resident Evil 5 during the game's development, but not in the finished product.Jonathan Holmes, Zombies and the Tyrant were cut from Resident Evil 5, Destructoid, 08.24.2010. The final boss battle of Resident Evil: Revelations might also be called a variation of the Tyrant (created by that game's T-Abyss virus), but this is debatable. Tyrants have been consistently depicted as grotesque and brutally violent creatures, but their intelligence has varied. The first two Tyrants in Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil are depicted as unintelligent, while the T-103 models such as the T-00 (Mr. X) in Resident Evil 2 and the titular Nemesis T-Type in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis are shown to possess limited intelligence and the ability to carry out specific instructions. Both Nemesis-T Type and the T-103 series (two more T-103 Tyrants, code-named Ivan, appear in Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles) are prone to uncontrolled mutation when damaged. Alexia Ashford in Code Veronica retains her full intelligence after being exposed to the T-Veronica virus and gains psychic abilities, including pyrokinesis; similarly, the TG-virus mutated Morpheus D. Duvall in Resident Evil: Dead Aim (Tyrant T-092) gains bio-electric abilities. The weapons used by Tyrants have also varied; while most Tyrants in the Resident Evil series rely on sheer physical force to subdue opponents, Nemesis, retaining some intelligence due to the Nemesis parasite, is able to use a shoulder-fired hand-held rocket launcher (and a minigun in Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon CityZach Pint, The Nemesis Returns in the Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City Trailer, Planet Xbox 360.) and T-ALOS (Tyrant- Armored Lethal Organic System) in The Umbrella Chronicles is equipped with a shoulder-mounted multiple rocket launcher. Outside of the Resident Evil franchise, there is a Tyrant card in the NDS version of SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash. In Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Jill Valentine has a special move that calls forth a Tyrant. A prototype Tyrant appears in the background of the Tricell Laboratory stage in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds; Tyrant was considered for addition as a playable character, but was rejected over concerns about the game's ESRB rating.Tim Turi, Resident Evil 1‚Äôs Tyrant Cut From Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 Roster ‚Äì News, GameInformer, April 20, 2010. The Nemesis T-Type was later added as a playable character in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.Characters - Nemesis - Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 , Capcom. In other media The Tyrant Fossil appears only in the novel Resident Evil: Underworld. In the third Resident Evil live-action film, Resident Evil: Extinction (and its novelization), Umbrella's researcher Dr. Alexander Isaacs tries to subdue his mutation with an antivirus after being bitten by an enhanced zombie. He is shot for insubordination by an executive, Alexander Slater, and is immediately reanimated as a Tyrant.

Royal Street. Southern Decadence is an annual six-day event held in New Orleans, Louisiana, by the gay and lesbian community during Labor Day Weekend, culminating in a parade through the French Quarter on the Sunday before Labor Day. History The event traces its beginnings to August 1972, as an end-of-summer party among a group of 40‚Äì50 friends both straight and gay. They billed their event as \\"Southern Decadence Party: Come As Your Favorite Southern Decadent.\\" People who attended were required to dress as their favorite decadent Southerner. Two weeks later, the group threw another party as a farewell to Michael Evers, who left to join his lover, David Randolph, in Michigan.Smith, Howard Philips and Frank Perez, Southern Decadence in New Orleans, (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2018). The first small \\"walking parade\\" occurred the following year when the participants first met at Johnny Matassa's BarSears, James Thomas.

(Chapel Hill, N.C.: Rutgers University Press, 2001) 97. in the French Quarter to show off their costumes and then walk back home to Belle Reve, a name taken from A Streetcar Named Desire, in the Trem√© neighbourhood via Esplanade Avenue. This first group impersonated people and characters ranging from Belle Watling (the prostitute character in Gone With the Wind) and Mary Ann Mobley to Tallulah Bankhead and Helen Keller. The event expanded with Frederick Douglas Wright, an African American,Sears, James Thomas. Rebels, Rubyfruit, and Rhinestones: Queering Space in the Stonewall South. (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Rutgers University Press, 2001) 98. appointed as the first grand marshal by members of the original group in 1974, who would have complete control over the parade of incredible characters and costumes as they marched through the French Quarter. Characteristics Decadence, as it is commonly known by participants, is marked by parades, bead tossing, street parties and dance parties. In these ways it resembles New Orleans Mardi Gras, however, Southern Decadence tends to be more sexual in tone and is generally geared towards more upscale and mature revelers. Decadence crowds in the Quarter typically match or exceed Mardi Gras crowds. Most events take place in or around the French Quarter neighbourhood centered at the intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann streets. Crowds range from 100,000 to 300,000 revelers from across the nation and world. In 2018, there were over 250,000 participants and the positive economic impact on the City of New Orleans was estimated at over $275 million. Decadence caters primarily to gay men, but is still lesbian friendly.http://www.southerndecadence.net/faq.htm Dykes on Bikes and other lesbian groups participate in the annual parade in the French Quarter and GrrlSpot (lesbian party promoter) sponsors a few events for lesbians.Smith, Howard Philips and Frank Perez, Southern Decadence in New Orleans, (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2018).https://gonola.com/lgbt-new-orleans/an-insiders-guide- to-southern-decadence Themes Themes were presented on and off from the beginning, but did not become a consistent fixture of the event until \\"Plagues, Pests, Parasites\\" theme in 1988. They have been featured every year that the Decadence has been held since then. They have ranged from themes as varied as \\"Voodoo That You Do\\", \\"Menage √† Trois\\", \\"Ancient Truths, Lies, and Sacrifice\\", and \\"Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back.\\" The theme for 2018 was \\"House of Bourbon -- Unleash Your Beast.\\" The official colors were Royal Blue and Canary Yellow. The theme for 2019 was ‚ÄúFruit Salad: Come Toss A Good Time‚Äù and the official ‚Äúcolors‚Äù are Polka Dots and Pinstripes. The theme and colors for 2021 will be announced in June. Opposition In years past, religious and conservative groups have rallied against the festival. In 2003 there was a formal petition filed to have the event terminated, with video footage handed over to officials depicting dozens of men engaged in \\"public sex acts\\". There were examples of men exposing themselves to others for beads, similar to the way women have long exposed their breasts for the traditional Mardi Gras balcony bead toss. The complaints led to a vocal response from business owners and hoteliers in New Orleans, in support of the festival. Ultimately the police posted notices clarifying what constitutes public sex. The pastor who spearheaded, videotaped, and filed the petition, Grant Storms was arrested in February 2011 after being caught masturbating in a public park. He was convicted of obscenity on August 22, 2012. The city later passed an ordinance that effectively banned the dissemination of any social, political, or religious message on Bourbon Street from sunrise to sunset, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. City Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, who sponsored the ordinance, said the city \\"has a legitimate interest in protecting residents and visitors in the highly trafficked area of Bourbon Street at night. She said aggressive solicitation can be a crowd-control issue, and people are allowed under the law to speak their messages if they take five steps off Bourbon Street. This is really an issue of trying to protect public safety.\\" Nine preachers and activists were subsequently arrested on September 1, 2012, after they allegedly yelled slurs at people attending Southern Decadence on Bourbon Street. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union during the first round of their case, those arrested saw the law temporarily suspended via a restraining order that was granted by a federal judge. Later the New Orleans City Council voted to lift the ordinance against the 2011 ban against Street Preaching from sunset to sunrise on the city's famous Bourbon Street. The unconstitutionally of the city restrictions which (prohibited a person or group from gathering on Bourbon Street) \\"for the purpose of disseminating any social, political or religious message\\" was \\"so patently unconstitutional that they could not hope the judge would rule otherwise\\", said attorney Nate Kellum with the Center for Religious Expression. Cancellations=Hurricane Katrina In the year 2005, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially cancelled in the wake of safety precautions against Hurricane Katrina. However, a very small group of residents who still remained in the French Quarter celebrated the event anyway. An abbreviated parade took place in the French Quarter with some two dozen participants. Most were French Quarter hold-outs; there were also at least a couple of people who had to wade in through flooded streets from other neighbourhoods to get there. As the city was officially being evacuated at the time, a police officer at first attempted to stop the small observation of tradition, but one of the participants was able to produce the parade permit issued pre-Katrina showing it was a scheduled legal event, and the small procession was allowed to continue. National media reporters noted the event. It was the first parade in New Orleans after the hurricane, the most recent previous New Orleans parade having been the Krewe of OAK \\"Midsummer Mardi Gras\\" parade the night before the city's mandatory evacuation. With the theme \\"Southern Decadence Rebirth\\", the event rebounded in 2006, attracting near- normal crowds. In 2007, the Bourbon Street Extravaganza, annually hosted by Napoleon's Itch, saw Deborah Cox, Fredrick Ford, Jeanie Tracy and Mat Jordan headline the festival. Hurricane Gustav Due to the approach of Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and a mandatory evacuation notice, some events on Saturday and all official Southern Decadence events after Sunday, August 31 midday were cancelled that year. As a result of Sunday's parade being cancelled, the 2008 Southern Decadence Grand Marshals, Paloma (Samson Utley) and Tittie Toulouse (Gary Delaune), returned for 2009. However, as was the case with 2005, a small group of French Quarter residents still celebrated the 2008 event anyway with an \\"unofficial\\" parade taking place once again in the French Quarter. That parade had some two-dozen participants, just like three years earlier. With the theme \\"Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back\\", the event once again rebounded as a whole in 2009, attracting near-normal crowds. COVID-19 pandemic In the year 2020, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially cancelled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The parish includes the hamlet of Crocker End, about east of the village. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 727. Archaeology It is claimed that in the 17th century a \\"Pal√¶olithic floor\\" was found in Nettlebed Common. Mesolithic flint microliths and cores have been found in the parish. History The earliest known records of the name \\"Nettlebed\\" are from the 13th century. The Inquisitiones post mortem record it as Netelbedde in AD 1252 and 1276. The name does mean a nettlebed: a place overgrown with nettles. Nettlebed village is on an ancient route through the Chiltern Hills between Henley and Wallingford, which for centuries was part of a trunk route between London and Oxford. The road between Henley and Wallingford was made into a turnpike in 1736 and ceased to be a turnpike in 1873. It is now classified the A4130. The White Hart Nettlebed's strategic position led to its having several pubs, inns and coaching inns. They included the White Hart, which is 17th-century, and the Bull Inn and Sun Inn, which are 18th-century. Only the White Hart in the High Street is still trading. Nettlebed had a sub-post office and general store in Watlington Street. It has now ceased trading and is a private house. In 2012 Thierry Kelaart and Patrick Heathcote-Amory, son of Sir Ian Heathcote- Amory were married at St Bartholomew's parish church. Michael Middleton acted as father of the bride and guests included the Duchess of Cambridge. The house at 25, High Street, also known as the Old Priest House, is a Grade II listed building. The building is probably 16th-century with an 18th-century front and 19th-century windows. Parish church John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens in St Bartholomew's parish church The Church of England parish of Saint Bartholomew was originally a chapelry of the adjacent parish of Benson. There is a record of the Empress Matilda giving the benefice of Benson, including chapels at Nettlebed and Warborough, to the Augustinian Abbey at nearby Dorchester, Oxfordshire in about AD 1140. The Medi√¶val church building was replaced in 1845‚Äì46 by the present Gothic Revival brick building, designed by a member of the Hakewill family of architects. The only surviving part of the previous church is the lower stages of the brick west tower, which seems to be 18th-century. The church has some 20th-century stained glass windows, including two made in 1970 by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens. One is the chancel east window, in which a central tree of life is flanked by fish on one side and butterflies on the other. The other is the baptistery south window in the south aisle. This shows a tree of life with birds perching in it including an owl, a hawk and a pheasant. The tower has a ring of six bells, all cast by Charles and George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1846. Pottery Bricks, tiles and pottery were made in Nettlebed from the second half of the 14th century until the 1930s. In the 15th century Nettlebed supplied ceramic tiles to Abingdon Abbey and bricks to Stonor House. The name \\"Crocker End\\" means \\"Potter's End\\". One remaining brick \\"bottle kiln\\" is preserved in Nuffield. It may be 17th-century. It is a Grade II* listed building. In 1674 George Ravenscroft obtained from Nettlebed the sand used in the make the first flint glass. Nettlebed smock mill Windmill Nettlebed had what seems to have been the only smock mill in Oxfordshire. It used to be at Chinnor but was moved to a windier site at Nettlebed in about 1825. It was a slender octagonal building with four common sails and a fantail. It burned down in 1912. Amenities=Nettlebed Folk Club The village has a long- established and highly regarded folk club which holds concerts on Monday evenings from 8pm at The Village Club in Nettlebed High Street. The Folk Song Club is a volunteer run, non-profit organisation. It was founded in July 1975 at the Bull Inn. When Brakspear Brewery closed the Bull Inn in 1991, the club moved to its present venue, which has capacity for 200 people. Many notable singers and musicians have performed at the club. They include Martin Carthy, Fairport Convention, John Kirkpatrick, Ralph McTell, Show of Hands, Steeleye Span, Richard Thompson.

On 31 August 1986, Admiral Nakhimov collided with the large bulk carrier Pyotr Vasev in the Tsemes Bay, near the port of Novorossiysk, Russian SFSR, and quickly sank. In total, 423 of the 1,234 people on board died. History=Career: 1925‚Äì1945 Berlin was built by Bremer Vulkan at Vegesack, Germany (Yard 614) and was completed in March 1925. She was launched on 25 March 1925, and commissioned on 17 September 1925. The ship was long, had four decks and a volume of . She originally operated the Bremen ‚Äì Southampton ‚Äì Cherbourg ‚Äì New York City run for the North German Lloyd Line. The ship's main route was between Bremerhaven, Southampton and New York, which she began on 26 September 1925 and operated until May 1939 when she was laid up in Bremerhaven for refitting. On 12 November 1928, Berlin rescued the passengers and crew of the liner ,Newspaper account of Vestris disaster. which sank off the coast of Virginia en route from New York City to Barbados. An estimated 113 people died in the sinking. Berlin was chartered by the Nazis in 1939 as a Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude, KdF) workers' cruising ship and was used as a hospital ship later on in World War II. World War II SS Berlin at Langelinie, between 1940-42 Berlin was one of eight German ships commissioned as hospital ships (Lazarettschiffe) during World War II. Most, if not all, of these ships also served in other capacities during the war after being decommissioned as hospital ships, mainly as accommodation or transport ships for military personnel. All German hospital ships were given alphabetic identifiers, Berlins being 'A'. On 16 July 1939, Berlin began her conversion to hospital ship and entered service with the Kriegsmarine as Lazarettschiff A, Sanit√§tsamt Ost on 23 August 1939. The ship had berthing for 400 patients, with a crew of 165. Initially serving in Norwegian waters, she was identified as \\"Field Post Number 07520\\". By January 1945, Berlin was assigned to Operation Hannibal, the transport of refugees and soldiers from the Eastern Baltic. On 31 January 1945, while forming up in convoy to head east, Berlin struck a mine off Swinem√ºnde, and was put in tow for Kiel.Koburger, Charles, Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees, Praeger Publishing, NY, 1989, p.84. She then hit another mine and was beached (23.53 hr, at position 54¬∞02.6 N/14¬∞19 E, in shallow waters). There was one fatality. All usable equipment was salvaged by 5 February 1945, and the ship was abandoned. Soviet service She was refloated and salvaged by the Soviets in 1949 and renamed Admiral Nakhimov after Admiral Pavel Nakhimov, a 19th-century Russian naval commander who played a prominent role in the Crimean War. After her conversion, her size was increased to . She entered passenger service for the Black Sea Steamship Company in 1957. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ship was used to transport soldiers to Cuba. During the peak summer travel season, Admiral Nakhimov operated cruises on the Black Sea between Odessa and Batumi, a six-day round trip. She carried an average of 1,000 people per voyage. She was the flagship of the Black Sea passenger fleet for several years until more modern liners entered service. Sinking Admiral Nakhimov docked in Novorossiysk, August 31, 1986. She would sink that evening. At 10:00 p.m. Moscow Time on 31 August 1986, Admiral Nakhimov sailed from Novorossiysk en route to Sochi, its next stop. There were 888 passengers and 346 crew members aboard. Most of the passengers were Ukrainian, with others from Russia, Moldova, the Baltic republics and Central Asia. The captain of the ship was Vadim Markov. Just minutes into the voyage, the ship's pilot noticed that the large bulk carrier Pyotr Vasev was on a collision course with Admiral Nakhimov. Pyotr Vasev was a Japanese-built, 18,604-ton freighter recently acquired by the Soviet Union, and was carrying a cargo of oats and barley from Canada. The pilot radioed a warning to Pyotr Vasev, and the freighter responded, \\"Don't worry. We will pass clear of each other. We will take care of everything.\\" Despite the message, Captain Viktor Tkachenko of Pyotr Vasev did nothing to slow his ship or change course. Convinced that the freighter would pass without incident, Captain Markov of Admiral Nakhimov retired to his cabin, leaving his second mate Alexander Chudnovsky in charge. From 11:00 p.m., Chudnovsky radioed Pyotr Vasev several times, asking about her course and her further actions. Chudnovsky changed the ship's course 10 degrees portside. At 11:10 p.m., Chundovsky cried on VHF to the freighter, \\"Immediately reverse full astern!\\" When it was clear that the freighter was headed directly for the ship, Pyotr Vasyovs engines were thrown in reverse. Admiral Nakhimov turned hard to port, but it was too late. At 11:12 p.m., Admiral Nakhimov was struck by Pyotr Vasev from the port at Novorossiysk and from shore, at While many passengers had gone to bed by this time, some were on deck listening and dancing to music. They could only watch helplessly as the freighter rammed into the starboard side of the ship at a speed of about . Admiral Nakhimov continued forward with the freighter's bow in its side, ripping a hole in the hull between the engine and boiler rooms. Admiral Nakhimov immediately took on a list on her starboard side, and her lights went out upon impact. After a few seconds, the emergency diesel generator powered on, but the lights went out again two minutes later, plunging the sinking ship into darkness. People below decks found themselves lost in the dark and rapidly canting hallways. There was no time to launch the lifeboats. Hundreds of people dived into the oily water, clinging to lifejackets, barrels and pieces of debris. Admiral Nakhimov sank in only eight minutes. Rescue ships began arriving just 10 minutes after the ship went down. Pyotr Vasev was not badly damaged, and assisted in the rescue effort. Sixty-four rescue ships and 20 helicopters rushed to the scene, and 836 people were pulled from the water. Some people were so slick with fuel oil that they could not keep hold of the hands of their rescuers. Sailors had to jump into the water to save people. Admiral Nakhimov lacked proper ventilation, which was the reason all 90 windows in the cabins were open during the accident. The bulkheads that would have prevented the ship from sinking were removed during the conversion. Passengers and crew had little time to escape, and 423 of the 1,234 on board perished. Sixty-four of those killed were crew members and 359 were passengers. The event was not reported in the news for forty eight hours. The survivors were only allowed to send telegrams saying \\"Alive and well in Novorossiysk.\\" The wreck of Admiral Nakhimov lies on its starboard side in of water in Tsemes Bay off Novorossiysk. Pyotr Vasev was renamed and operated under other flags until 2012. Investigation The Soviet government formed a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. It determined that both Captain Markov of Admiral Nakhimov and Captain Tkachenko of Pyotr Vasev had violated navigational safety rules. Despite repeated orders to let Admiral Nakhimov pass, Tkachenko refused to slow his ship and only reported the accident 40 minutes after it occurred. Captain Markov was absent from the bridge. The inquiry took place in 1987 in Odessa. Both Captains Markov and Tkachenko were found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Both were released in 1992.

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League. The team wear yellow and black stripes kit and play their home games at Croit Lowey in Port Erin. They have been Isle of Man League Champions ten times and won the Manx FA Cup nine times. History Rushen United F.C. formed in September 1910 following a civic meeting at St Catherines Church Hall in Port Erin. The club motto is Moryn Vannin, which in Manx roughly means \\"The Pride of Mann\\". The club has a reserve team who compete in the Isle of Man Football Combination as well as a ladies team and a junior academy. Rushen's first trophy came in the 1921‚Äì22 season when they won the Railway Cup. They won the Manx FA Cup for the first time in 1923‚Äì24 and were crowned Isle of Man champions for the first time in 1925‚Äì26, when they also won the Manx FA Cup and the Hospital Cup. The club's highest profile match came in July 2005 in front of 3,288 spectators at the National Sports Centre in Douglas when Bolton Wanderers beat Rushen United 10‚Äì0. Bolton included eight first team regulars including striker Kevin Davies who scored four times in the first 28 minutes as well as Kevin Nolan, Henrik Pedersen and Gary Speed all of whom also scored. The match was filmed by Sky Sports to be featured on the stations Premier League Preview Show. It was also a fund raiser for the club's proposed new indoor training facility for which the club needed to raise ¬£250,000. They managed to raise a total of ¬£35,000 from the match and a Gala Dinner. Locally, the club's biggest game each year is against Peel. The rivalry is believed to have begun as many of Peel's players were fishermen. Whilst Port Erin and nearby Port St Mary both had teams prior to the formation of Rushen United, many of the players in these teams also went to sea. Also, both clubs are overlooked by \\"Towers\\". Peel have Corrins Folly and Rushen have Milners Tower, which stands sentry to Port Erin Bay. During 2002, and at the age of 50, club stalwart Eric Nelson played his 1000th game during a Division One fixture against Pulrose United at Croit Lowey, and was presented with a memento to mark the occasion. During the late 1970s and up to the late 1980s, the club won the First Division seven times in eleven seasons, including four years on the trot from 1977 to 1981. As of the 2008‚Äì09 season they are still in the top flight in Isle of Man football, which in 2007 was rebranded as the Sure Mobile Premier League. On 5 May 2010, Rushen clinched its first Premier League title with a 2‚Äì0 victory over Michael United thanks to goals from Josh Kelly and Steve Riding. This brought a period of 22 years since winning Manx football's top prize to an end and ensured that the club will enter its centenary year as champions. In April 2011 a comprehensive victory over Laxey in the Isle of Man FA Cup final gave the 'Spaniards' their first FA Cup win for 21 years.

It serves the barrier islands south of Long Island itself, beginning on Long Beach Barrier Island at an intersection with Lido Boulevard in Point Lookout. From here, it heads generally east‚Äìwest across Alder and Meadow islands to an interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway on Jones Island, a part of Jones Beach State Park located just north of Jones Beach Island. The islands served by the Loop Parkway are separated by narrow channels of water, all of which connect to Jones Inlet. The parkway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and inventoried by the department as New York State Route 908C (NY 908C), an unsigned reference route. The highway was built in 1934 as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, funded with money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was completed six months ahead of schedule and officially opened on October 27, 1934, by Robert Moses, then a candidate for Governor of New York, and New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. The plans to fund the highway included the implementation of tolls, which went into effect on January 2, 1935. These tollbooths, once considered the murder site of Sonny Corleone in Mario Puzo's The Godfather, were closed in 1978 as part of Governor Hugh Carey's efforts to establish that year's state budget. Route description The Loop Parkway westbound approaching Lido Boulevard in Point Lookout The Loop Parkway begins at an at-grade intersection with Lido Boulevard on the eastern end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two U-turn ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island, serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island. The Loop Parkway heads east from Alder Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections. At the eastern edge of the island, the highway reaches Swift Creek, another channel separating Meadow Island from Jones Island. The parkway crosses the waterway and immediately enters a trumpet interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway. The right-of-way of the Loop Parkway connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook Parkway while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook Parkway. The Loop Parkway handled an average of 30,520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT. Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003, when the department recorded a daily average of 24,740 vehicles.  History = Construction  The Loop Parkway, originally envisioned as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, was conceived as part the original design for the Long Island Parkway System, developed by Robert Moses and the Long Island State Park Commission (LISPC) in 1924. Moses wanted a parkway system to alleviate congestion on \\"unattractive\\" local roads. The system was designed to connect several parks that were under construction at the time, including Jones Beach State Park, Bethpage State Park and Sunken Meadow State Park. In 1927, the parkway system was linked to parkways within New York City's boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, and in 1929, Jones Beach State Park and the Ocean Parkway opened, providing access to the mainland via the Jones Beach Causeway (now part of the Wantagh State Parkway). The Loop Parkway eastbound at the junction with the Meadowbrook in Freeport In May 1933, construction began on the Meadowbrook State Parkway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway. It was financed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington D.C., which loaned $5,050,000 (1933 USD) to the LISPC for the new parkways. It was proposed that the loan would be repaid in 25 years. The two highways would be connected by way of a trumpet interchange on Jones Island, with a total of of hydraulic fill was used to build both parkways, and a new channel for boats heading to South Oyster Bay was constructed as part of the projects. The roadway of the Loop Causeway would be made of macadam pavement and be wide and help connect mainland Long Island to Jones Beach and Long Beach. Both roadways were expected to be completed by January 1, 1935. They were ultimately completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule. The Long Beach Loop Causeway was opened to extreme fanfare on October 27, 1934, as was the Meadowbrook State Parkway with parades celebrating the event were held in Freeport and Rockville Centre, and they were attended by Robert Moses, at the time a candidate for Governor of New York, and Fiorello LaGuardia, the Mayor of New York City.  Tolls  Long Creek Bridge When the Jones Beach State Park Authority was given the loan by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in March 1933, a toll was planned for both the Meadowbrook Causeway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway to help repay the loan. Tollbooths were constructed, and a 25-cent toll (1935 USD) went into effect on both roadways on January 2, 1935. On that day, the supervisor with the LISPC reported that 300 people used the highway. In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority raised the toll on the Southern State Parkway to 25 cents, while the Loop Parkway retained its 25 cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in a deal with the State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12 billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978 USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads. The tollbooths on the Wantagh State Parkway, where Sonny Corleone was supposedly murdered After the governor and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8 million (1978 USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state to take over the Loop Parkway was passed on March 31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979. In Mario Puzo's 1969 novel, The Godfather, Sonny Corleone was in the process of running to go settle a years-long dispute with Carlo Rizzi when he drove his Buick across Jones Beach from the Wantagh State Parkway (mentioned as the Jones Beach Causeway) towards the \\"causeway that would take him over the water from Long Beach\\". However, when Corleone approached the toll on the Jones Beach Causeway, the toll-taker fumbled his money and soon two men approached him with guns along with a fake toll-taker from another booth. All three men shot Corleone and flew back via car to the Meadowbrook Parkway and into Long Beach via the Loop Parkway. A common misconception is that the murder occurred on either the Loop or the Meadowbrook parkways; however, the book specifies that the event occurred at the tollbooth on the Wantagh State Parkway.

On 1 October 2014, Deutsche B√∂rse AG became the 14th announced member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative. HistoryCompany Deutsche B√∂rse More than 3,200 employees service customers in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Deutsche B√∂rse has locations in Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Spain, as well as representative offices in Beijing, London, Paris, Chicago, New York, Hong Kong, and Dubai. FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierb√∂rse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), is one of the world's largest trading centers for securities. With a share in turnover of around 90%, it is the largest of the German stock exchanges. Deutsche B√∂rse AG operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Deutsche B√∂rse is the owner of Clearstream, a clearing house based in Luxembourg. Mergers and acquisitions On 3 May 2000 it was announced that the London Stock Exchange would merge with Deutsche B√∂rse, though the deal fell through before the merger could be realized.http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/3/newsid_2481000/2481359.stm In 2001, Deutsche B√∂rse tried again to merge with the London Stock Exchange, followed by a takeover bid in late 2004, but both offers rejected by the LSE. After CEO Werner Seifert was forced to resign by the main shareholders in 2005, Deutsche B√∂rse changed plans and entered into advanced negotiations for a merger with Euronext which would have brought two of the biggest stock exchanges in Europe into one holding. The New York Stock Exchange beat out Deutsche B√∂rse's final bid for Euronext in 2006. Since 2007 Deutsche B√∂rse operates the joint venture Scoach with SIX Swiss Exchange to provide a European derivative trading platform. In July 2015, Deutsche B√∂rse bought the 360T company for 725 million euros and also acquired all shares (100%) of the joint venture STOXX AG for a purchase price of CHF 650 million from the SIX Group. Attempted NYSE Euronext merger On 7 December 2008, Deutsche B√∂rse rebuffed rumors that it might join with NYSE Euronext (the company formed as a result of the merger of NYSE and Euronext) to create the world's leading stock exchange.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081207/ap_on_bi_ge/eu_germany_deutsche_boerse_nyse;_ylt=AsauGZb2LtlsfwROcCUexTmyBhIF While the company claims that it pursued the matter, on 8 December 2008, it reported that talks which began on 25 November 2008, were closed without any result due to differences in valuation of the company. Deutsche B√∂rse had also considered the acquisition again in 2009. On 9 February 2011, reports suggested that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche B√∂rse were in advanced talks about an all-stock merger. Deutsche B√∂rse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse. The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalisation of listed companies equal to US$15 trillion, US$13.39 trillion of which is part of the much larger NYSE Euronext, which is approximately six times the size of Deutsche B√∂rse. President and deputy CEO of NYSE Euronext Dominique Cerutti would become the new company's president and head of commercial and internal technology. Roland Bellegarde, also of NYSE Euronext, would become the head of European cash equities. The new company would potentially have 300 million euros (US$410 million) in cost savings. However, the merger would be subject to review in both the United States and European Union under concerns it could create a \\"de facto monopoly\\". NYSE Euronext shareholders approved the Deutsche B√∂rse‚Äôs all-stock deal on 7 July 2011, and Deutsche B√∂rse shareholders had accepted the deal by 15 July 2011. On 22 December 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on the condition that a Deutsche B√∂rse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5% interest in Direct Edge. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until 31 March 2012, as the exchange operators try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.NYSE, Deutsche Boerse Merger Date Extended, Bloomberg, 28 December 2011. Retrieved 9 January 2012. The European Commission blocked the merger on 1 February 2012, citing the fact that the merged company would have a near monopoly.\\"Mergers: Commission blocks proposed merger between Deutsche B√∂rse and NYSE Euronext\\", European Commission press release, 1 February 2012. This measure taken by the EC is the fourth blocking in over a decade.http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/statistics.pdf The commission rejected the merger on antitrust grounds, saying the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading with an estimated 93% market share. \\"This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets\\", said former Deutsche B√∂rse chief executive Reto Francioni. NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said: \\"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on\\".\\"NYSE Euronext merger with Deutsche Boerse blocked by EU\\", BBC, 1 February 2012. Failed merger with London Stock Exchange Group In March 2016, the company announced it had reached an agreement with London Stock Exchange Group to merge. The companies will be brought under a new holding company, UK TopCo, and will retain both headquarters in London and Frankfurt. The deal needs approval from regulators in the European Union, the U.S. and Russia. The London Stock Exchange said Russian approval was needed because it owns Exactpro, a firm with offices in Russia specializing in quality assurance for exchanges and financial organizations. The European Commission opened an in- depth investigation into the proposed Deutsche B√∂rse/LSEG merger on 28 September 2016. The European Commission delayed its decision on the deal by 15 working days to 6 March 2017. LSEG plans to hive off the French half of its LCH SA arm in a bid to ease EU concerns about the deal although the companies have not formally submitted any concessions to the Commission. In February 2017, the Commission required that the parties commit to the divestment of LSEG's majority stake in fixed-income sovereign bond trading platform MTS S.p.A. LSEG stated it would not sell MTS in Italy to appease anti-trust concerns. The planned merger between the two exchanges, which was estimated to create the largest exchange in Europe, was subsequently described as \\"at risk\\" by the Wall Street Journal. The merger attempt was blocked by EU Competition Regulator on 29 March 2017 stating that \\"The Commission's investigation concluded the merger would have created a de facto monopoly in the markets for clearing fixed income instruments\\". Recent In October 2017, several shareholders called for the resignation of the chairman. On 16 November 2017, Theodor Weimer was appointed as new CEO of Deutsche B√∂rse AG, effective January 2018.

He played college football for the University of Georgia, was a three- time All-American, and was recognized as the top college defensive player in the nation. Pollack had 36 sacks during his collegiate career, third most in NCAA history. He was a first-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. Early years Pollack was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He attended Shiloh High School in Snellville, Georgia, and was a star in football, basketball and wrestling. In football, as a senior, he was a Class 5A all-state selection and the Atlanta Touchdown Club named him the Defensive Lineman of the Year. College career Pollack attended the University of Georgia, where he played for coach Mark Richt's Georgia Bulldogs football team from 2001 to 2004 and was a roommate of future NFL quarterback David Greene. For three consecutive seasons, he was recognized as a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection and a first-team All-American (2002, 2003, 2004)‚Äîtwice as an NCAA consensus first- team honoree, having received the first-team selections of a majority of All- America selector organizations in 2002 and 2004. He is only the second player in Bulldogs team history to earn first-team All-American honors in three seasons, following Heisman Trophy-winner Herschel Walker. In addition to his All-American accolades, Pollack received the following: * SEC Player of the Year Award (2004) * SEC Defensive Player of the Year Award (2004) * Chuck Bednarik Award (2004) * Ted Hendricks Award (2003, 2004) * Lombardi Award (2004) * Lott Trophy (2004) His signature play came during the second game of the 2002 season.

Seen through the eyes of the idealistic scientist Leo Kall, Kallocain is a depiction of a totalitarian world state. An important aspect of the novel is the relationships and connections between the various characters, such as the marriage of the main character and his wife, Linda Kall, and the feelings of jealousy and suspicion that may arise in a society with heavy surveillance and legal uncertainty. One of the novel's central ideas coincides with contemporary rumors of truth drugs that ensured the subordination of every citizen to the state. Both Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and Boye's Kallocain are drug dystopias, or societies in which pharmacology is used to suppress opposition to authority. However, unlike Brave New World in which a drug is used to suppress the urge to nonconformity generally, a drug in Kallocain is used to detect individual acts and thoughts of rebellion. Kallocain has been translated into more than 10 languages; English-language translations include those by Gustaf Lannestock (2002, University of Wisconsin Press) and David McDuff (2019, Penguin Classics). It was adapted into a television miniseries in 1981 by Hans Abramson. In 2016, the novel was nominated for the Retro-Hugo award for the best science fiction novel of 1941.  Plot  The plot centers on Leo Kall and is written in the form of a diary or memoir. Kall lives with his wife, Linda Kall, in a city intended for chemical industry. Leo is a scientist, who is initially very loyal to the government and develops the truth drug Kallocain. It has the effect that anyone who takes it will reveal anything, even things of which they were not consciously aware. Major themes include the notion of the self in a totalitarian state, the meaning of life, and the power of love. Apart from the laboratory work and testing by Leo Kall, much of the novel takes place in the home of Leo and Linda.

He was the United States Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations from September 1979 until January 20, 1981. Biography McHenry was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up across the river in East St. Louis, Illinois. He attended Illinois State University, graduating with a BS in 1957. He then continued on to earn a master's degree from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1959 and began a doctoral program at Georgetown University. McHenry spent much of his career working in foreign diplomacy. He began working with the United States Department of State in 1963, and spent eight years there. From 1971 to 1976, he worked for a series of private think- tanks - the Brookings Institution, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace - writing about foreign policy. In 1976, McHenry served as a member of President Carter's transition staff at the State Department before joining the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. In March 1977, he was appointed as the U.S. Deputy Representative to the United Nations Security Council. In August 1979, McHenry was the principal negotiator for the United States when a Soviet airliner carrying Russian ballerina Lyudmila Vlasova was prevented from taking off by Port Authority Police. Acting Secretary of State Warren Christopher had ordered the interception because Vlasova's husband, Alexander Godunov, who had defected two days earlier, had expressed his belief that his wife was returning to the Soviet Union against her will. Vlasova steadily maintained that she was returning voluntarily, but the U.S. representation was unwilling to accept her statement unless they could speak with her in the absence of Soviet officials. This request was denied.\\"Turmoil on the Tarmac\\"-Time magazine article Eventually Soviet officials allowed Vlasova to speak with U.S. representatives in a mobile lounge that was brought up to the plane. She convinced them that she was not returning under coercion, and the plane took off with Vlasova on board.Exit Stage Left-Time magazine article The timing of the Vlasova incident drew attention to McHenry at a critical time. Earlier that year, Andrew Young had been made to resign his post as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. after meeting with a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization, against U.S. policy, and making controversial remarks on political prisoners in the U.S. In September 1979, McHenry was appointed Ambassador and U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. by President Jimmy Carter. In 1986 McHenry received a L.H.D. from Bates College. He has served on the board of directors of several multi-national corporations and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is currently Professor of Diplomacy and International Affairs at Georgetown University. He has also been a director of The Coca-Cola Company since 1981, as well as a former director of AT&T; Corporation and International Paper. McHenry is an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.

On August 14, 2005, he signed a five-year, $9.2 million contract with the Rams with escalators that could take the value to over $11 million. The contract featured $5.5 million in guaranteed money, not including the signing bonus of $1 million. As a rookie, he was moved to right tackle, because the team had All-Pro Orlando Pace starting at left tackle. Barron passed Rex Tucker on the depth chart, starting 11 games, while making his pro debut against the Tennessee Titans and his first start against the New York Giants. In 2007, he started 16 games at right tackle. He switched from right to left tackle against the San Francisco 49ers, after Pace was injured in Week 1. In 2008, he started 15 of 16 games at right tackle, while contributing to running back Steven Jackson leading the league with an average of 118.4 yards from scrimmage. He was a part of an offensive line that allowed 45 sacks, the fewest by the Rams since 2003. In 2009, he started 16 games at left tackle after Pace was released. He allowed 7 sacks and led the league with 7 holding penalties. In a 35‚Äì0 loss against the San Francisco 49ers, his poor play resulted on him being benched for the rest of the game, after getting an illegal formation penalty for lining up in the backfield. all 16 at left tackle. He contributed to Jackson rushing for more than 1,400 yards (most in the NFC). In 2010, the Rams drafted offensive tackle Rodger Saffold to compete with Barron. On May 10, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for another underwhelming former first round draft choice in linebacker Bobby Carpenter. Barron had a disappointing career with the Rams, becoming notorious for his inconsistency, false starts and holding penalties. Although he was durable, starting 74 games at both left and right tackle, he struggled with penalties and poor blocking. He committed 43 false start penalties (13 in 2006), 13 holding penalties and allowed 33 sacks. Dallas Cowboys Barron with the Cowboys in 2011. In 2010, he was acquired to provide depth and compete with Doug Free for the left tackle position, after the release of Flozell Adams. He got off to an inauspicious beginning, in his first game and start at right tackle in place of an injured Marc Colombo, the Cowboys appeared to have come back from a 13-7 deficit on a touchdown pass from Tony Romo to Roy Williams on the final play against the Washington Redskins on the season opener. But Barron was flagged for holding defensive end Brian Orakpo and because the penalty was called against the offense, the game was over with the Cowboys losing. Although he was active for 10 additional games, he would not play another down and was not re-signed at the end of the year. New Orleans Saints On August 3, 2011, Barron signed with the New Orleans Saints. On August 18, he was put on the injured reserve list. He was waived with an injury settlement on October 22.

After escalating media attention on the declining mental health of Naomi Leong, both Virginia and Naomi were released on a bridging visa late in the evening of Monday 23 May 2005. Virginia Leong, a Malaysian citizen, was two months pregnant when she was arrested and placed under mandatory detention in 2001 for attempting to leave Australia without correct papers. Her daughter, born within the detention centre, was not automatically granted Australian citizenship and at the time of her release, remains stateless. At the time of her release, Naomi Leong was three years old and had lived her entire life within the detention system. Over this period she allegedly became mentally disturbed, exhibiting various signs including bruises from banging her head against walls. She was also purported to suffer from severe separation anxiety. From March till May 2005, psychiatrist Dr. Michael Dudley orchestrated a campaign to allow Naomi to visit a local playgroup for three hours a week, for the sake of her mental health. Dr. Dudley argued \\"She's been brought up in prison, in a highly abnormal environment with highly distressed people. It's not an environment conducive to child development.\\" The Immigration Department granted this request, allowing Naomi Leong three hours of association with others her own age once a week. Dr Dudley's report was also used as part of a growing media campaign to highlight problems that a number of groups saw with Australia's hard-line detention policy. Just prior to the release of the pair, the Malaysian media also began to report the story locally. According to former opposition leader Kim Beazley, this embarrassed the Howard government into acting. Shortly after her release, Virginia Leong was provided access to Australia's Medicare scheme, and the right to work (Class A visa). Naomi Leong was not granted access to Medicare and remained on a Class E visa. In addition, Virginia Leong is now required to pay approximately A$500,000 to the Australian government as repayment of the costs incurred by the government to hold her in detention.

Lake Junaluska, NC Early life Whatcoat was born in Quinton Gloucestershire, England. His mother and father were Charles and Mary Whatcoat. He considered himself fortunate to be in Church of England parish where the Minister, the Reverend Samuel Taylor, was \\"a converted man\\". He believed his mother to be converted. His father died when he was young leaving his wife with two sons and three daughters. When he was thirteen Whatcoat was apprenticed to Mr Joseph Jones who lived in Birmingham, shortly after moving to Darlaston in Staffordshire.Ph≈ìbus,William, Ed, Memoirs of the Rev. Richard Whatcoat, Late Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, New York, 1828 p 9 Whatcoat's conversion After completing his apprenticeship at the age of twenty-one, in 1757, he moved to nearby Wednesbury. There he began attending Methodist meetings and was challenged by their preaching which he described as \\"light and power to my soul\\". On the third of September 1758 he underwent a classic Evangelical conversion. He was reading his Bible when he came across verse 16 in Romans chapter eight\\"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our Spirit, that we are children of God\\". Whatcoat claimed that in that moment \\"my darkness was removed, and the Spirit did bear witness with my Spirit, that I was a child of God. In the same instant I was filled with unspeakable peace and joy in believing: all fear of death, judgement, and hell, suddenly vanished.\\"Ph≈ìbus ibid, pp 10-11 Whatcoat's spiritual journey continued and on the 28 March 1761 he understood that Grace was a free gift of God \\"my soul was drawn out and engaged in a manner it never was before. Suddenly I was stripped of all but love\\". He then spent the rest of his time in Wednesbury serving as a band leader, class leader and society steward amongst the growing Methodist community in the town.Ph≈ìbus ibid pp 12-13 Methodism in Wednesbury Methodism in Wednesbury at that time was recovering from the severe persecutions during the 1743 and 1744 anti-Methodist riots. Serious incidents continued across the West Midlands well into the 1760s. The Methodist community which met at Wednesbury included the young Francis Asbury, with whom Whatcoat developed a lifelong friendship, and William Legge the 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.Hallam, David J.A., Eliza Asbury: her cottage and her son, Studley 2003, p 9,24,36-37 Circuit work in Great Britain and Ireland Whatcoat wanted to develop his ministry and resolved to go full-time in 1769. John Pawson proposed him at that year's Methodist Conference and he was accepted as a probationer, initially stationed at Oxford. His subsequent stations were: 1770 Bedford, England; 1771 Inniskillen, Ireland; 1772 Armah, Ireland (during much of this stationing he was seriously ill); 1773 Pembrook, Wales; 1774 Brecknock, Wales; 1776 Launceston, Cornwall, England; 1777 St. Austle, Cornwall, England; 1778 Salisbury, Wiltshire, England; 1780 Northampton, England; 1781 Canterbury, Kent, England; 1782 Lynn, Norfolk, England; 1783 Norwich, Norfolk, England.Ph≈ìbus ibid, 13-16 Travels to America Methodism was originally conceived as a society within the Church of England, not a separate denomination. During the War of Independence the Church of England in the United States collapsed as most of the clergy left. This denied Methodist societies access to the sacraments of baptism and holy communion. In 1784 John Wesley remedied the situation by himself ordaining Francis Asbury in absentia and Thomas Coke, appointing them joint superintendents of the work in the new United States. Coke, Thomas Vasey and Whatcoat, who had been appointed a deacon, set out to America to consecrate Asbury at Baltimore on Christmas Day of that year Three years later Coke and Asbury assumed the title \\"Bishop\\", which did not please John Wesley.Hallam, ibid, pp 39,61,63 Coke, Vasey and Whatcoat set out for New York from Bristol on the 28th September 1784. The ship was called the \\"Four Friends\\" and during the first four days they were sea sick. They soon settled into a routine of prayers each morning and evening, with two preaching services on Sundays. They spent the evening reading up on the lives of preachers, saints, and divinity. At one point a fifteen-foot whale accompanied the ship, on another occasion they caught and ate a dolphin. The wind was against them and the journey was difficult with two nights of thunder and lightning. The arrived in New York six weeks and thousand miles later on 3 November 1784.Ph≈ìbus ibid, p19 Ministry in America Whatcoat threw himself wholeheartedly into the itinerant Methodist ministry across the thirteen states. He accompanied Francis Asbury on long missionary journeys taking him too many parts of the new country. Frequently they were in danger from Native Americans. Him and Asbury would often share the preaching, with one speaking in the morning, and the other, in the afternoon. He did not keep a journal as Asbury had doneClarke, E.T., Manning Potts, T., Payton, Jacob S., Editors The Journal and Letters of Francis Asbury, Vols. 1-3, Nashville and London, 1958 but Asbury mentions Whatcoat on many occasions. His short auto-biography, published after his death records many long journeys and preaching engagements.Ph≈ìbus, pp 19-44 At the Annual Methodist Conference held in Baltimore, Maryland in May 1800, Whatcoat was elected the third Bishop of the new church. \\"We had a most blessed time\\", he recalled, \\"and much preaching and fervent prayers, and strong exhortation through the city, while the high praises of a gracious God reverberated from street to street, house to house, which greatly alarmed the citizens. It was thought that not less than two hundred were converted during the sitting of the conference.\\"Ph≈ìbus ibid p29-30 During the last few years of his ministry Whatcoat continued to travel and preach even though he was often unwell, by then he was in his late sixties. In July 1805 he wrote \\"Notwithstanding my infirm state of body, through the blessing of God. I have been able to travel three thousand four hundred and sixteen miles the last twelve month.....I have great reason to bless God, who has preserved me these many years as an itinerant preacher, during which he have delivered me from many afflictions of body and mind\\"Ph≈ìbus ibid p 44 By the time of his death in 1806 he had been in itinerant ministry for 37 years, 22 of them in the United States. He never returned to England and never married. Bibliography *Ph≈ìbus,William, Ed, Memoirs of the Rev.

Origin The Benedictine Confederation is a union of monastic congregations that nevertheless retain their own autonomy, established by Pope Leo XIII in his brief \\"Summum semper\\" (12 July 1893), subsequently approved by his successors. Pope Pius XII explicitly ordered this union to be regulated by a \\"Lex Propria\\", which was later revised after the Second Vatican Council.Lex Propria Organization of the Benedictine Confederation Most Benedictine houses are loosely affiliated in 20 national or supra-national congregations. Each of these congregations elects its own Abbot President. These presidents meet annually in the Synod of Presidents. Additionally, there is a meeting every four years of the Congress of Abbots, which is made up of all abbots and conventual priors, both of monasteries that are members of congregations, as well as of those unaffiliated with any particular congregation. The Congress of Abbots elects the Abbot Primate, who serves a four-year term as the Confederation's representative and administrative head, although without direct jurisdiction over the individual Congregations. The Confederation has its headquarters at Sant'Anselmo in Rome, which is the seat of the Abbot Primate and hosts the quadrennial Congress of Abbots. Sant'Anselmo is also home to the Benedictine Pontifical Athenaeum. Communities of Benedictine nuns and Religious Sisters are joined in 61 congregations and federations that are associated with the Confederation, although they do not have full membership. In November 2001 after a consultation process with all monasteries of Benedictine women around the world, it was decided to use the name Communio Internationalis Benedictinarum (CIB) to designate all communities of Benedictine women recognized by the Abbot Primate as such and listed in the Catalogus Monasteriorum O.S.B. The first attempt to group Benedictine monasteries into national Congregations was at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. Only the English Benedictine Congregation survives from this early attempt at centralization, and in historical reality even this Congregation is a 17th-century foundation although it was given juridical continuity with the medieval English Congregation by the Papal Bull \\"Plantata\\" of 1633. Primacy of honor is given to the Subiaco Cassinese Congregation, since this Congregation includes the Abbey of Monte Cassino, where St Benedict wrote his Rule and was buried (although Fleury Abbey also claims to house the remains of the founder). Founded in 1872, the Congregation has its origin in the Congregation of the Abbey of Santa Giustina, founded in Padua in 1408 by Dom Ludovico Barbo. The Benedictines suffered badly in the anti-clerical atmosphere at the time of Napoleon and the modern Congregations were mostly founded in the 19th century when monasticism was revived. The majority are essentially national groupings, although the Subiaco Congregation (originally the Cassinese Congregation of the Primitive Observance) has from the first been truly international because of its interest in foreign mission. Since the time of the Reformation, there have been independent Benedictine communities in the Protestant (especially Anglican) traditions which maintain official friendly relations with the Benedictine Confederation, although they are not formally linked with it or its congregations. Throughout the Benedictine confederation and its subdivisions, independence and autonomy among communities are uniquely valued; too highly for Pope Pius XI, who complained that the largely nominal confederation was \\"an order without order\\". The basic unit has always been the individual abbey, rather than the Congregation. This explains why some houses (e.g. Monte Cassino, Subiaco, Saint Paul-outside-the-Walls (Rome), Montserrat and Pannonhalma) have unbroken histories of more than a thousand years while the Congregations to which they belong are more recent. This balance between autonomy and belonging is one of the distinguishing features of the Benedictine Confederation, and brings with it both strengths and weaknesses. One immediate consequence is that there is often great diversity of observance even between houses of the same Congregation: in liturgy, timetable, pastoral involvement and habit. Congregations of Benedictine Monks The present Confederation of Congregations of Monasteries of the Order of Saint Benedict, officially, the \\"Benedictine Confederation\\" of monks, consists of the following congregations in the order given in the Catalogus Monasteriorum OSB (dates in brackets are those of the foundation of the congregations ‚Äì Primacy of honour is given to the Cassinese Congregation, though the English Congregation is the oldest, because Monte Cassino was the original Abbey of St. Benedict himself.

Portrait of Thomas Gage by James Seymour, 1743 Seymour was born in London. His father was an amateur artist and art dealer, whose other business dealings (as a banker, goldsmith, and diamond merchant) afforded young Seymour the leisure time to study art on his own, either his father's or the art at the Virtuosi Club of St. Luke - a gentleman's club his father belonged to, specializing in art. In a short time the boy was a self-taught artist, familiar with many of the prominent artists of the period. Seymour's love of art was matched only by his love of horses. He began spending time at racetracks early on, and before long found himself absorbed in the sport - drawing, painting, owning, breeding, and racing horses. His art proved popular among the prominent sporting families of the day, eventually garnering Seymour patrons in Sir William Jolliffe and Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. Jolliffe's love for horses and art proved great, and his will would later establish an equestrian statue in Hampshire. In time, Seymour's work and fame had spread throughout Europe and America. Though ultimately his love for horseracing led to his financial ruin, Seymour still ranks among the most important early sporting artists, together with John Wootton and Peter Tillemans being considered one of the three founders of the sporting school.Ellis Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790, Baltimore, MD: Penguin, 1953, p. 215.

According to the Public Broadcasting Service his mid-1960s Issues in Science and Religion \\"has been credited with literally creating the contemporary field of science and religion.\\" In the citation nominating Barbour for the 1999 Templeton Prize, John B. Cobb wrote, \\"No contemporary has made a more original, deep and lasting contribution toward the needed integration of scientific and religious knowledge and values than Ian Barbour. With respect to the breadth of topics and fields brought into this integration, Barbour has no equal.\\" Biography Barbour was born on October 5, 1923, in Beijing, China, the second of three sons of an American Episcopal mother (who was the daughter of the obstetrician Robert Latou Dickinson) and a Scottish Presbyterian father. His family left China in 1931 and Barbour spent the remainder of his youth in the United States and England. A conscientious objector, he served in the Civilian Public Service for three years during the Second World War. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Swarthmore College and his Master of Science degree in physics from Duke University in 1946. In 1950, he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree in physics from the University of Chicago, where he worked as a teaching assistant to Enrico Fermi. He earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1956 from Yale University's Divinity School. Barbour taught at Carleton College beginning with a joint appointment in the departments of physics and philosophy. He began teaching religion full-time in 1960, when the university established a religion department. In the 1970s, he co-founded of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy program at Carleton, which later became the Environment and Technology Studies program. He retired in 1986 as the Winifred and Atherton Bean Professor Emeritus of Science, Technology and Society. Barbour gave the Gifford lectures from 1989 to 1991 at the University of Aberdeen. These lectures led to the book Religion in an Age of Science. He was awarded the Templeton Prize in 1999 for Progress in Religion in recognition of his efforts to create a dialogue between the worlds of science and religion. Barbour was married to Deane Kern from 1947 until her death in 2011. They had four children. Barbour suffered a stroke on December 20, 2013, at his home in Northfield, Minnesota, and remained in a coma at Abbott Northwestern Hospital until his death four days later.http://apps.carleton.edu/farewells/?story_id=1081774 Philosophy and theology In his efforts to link science and religion in Issues in Science and Religion, Barbour coined the term critical realism. This has been adopted by other scholars. He claimed the basic structure of religion is similar to that of science in some ways but also differs on some crucial points. They are part of the same spectrum in which both display subjective as well as objective features. The subjective include the theory on data, the resistance of comprehensive theories to falsification, and the absence of rules for choice among paradigms. Objective features include the presence of common data, evidence for or against a theory, and criteria which are not paradigm- dependent. The presence of subjective and objective features in both science and religion makes his thinking valuable and original. Barbour's arguments have been developed in significant and diverse ways by a variety of scholars, including Arthur Peacocke, John Polkinghorne, Sallie McFague, and Robert John Russell. His subjective / objective approach is prominent in the evolving paradigm of religious naturalism. Barbour considered critical realism an alternative to the competing interpretations of scientific theories: classical or naive realism, instrumentalism, and idealism. A critical realist perspective sees scientific theories yielding partial, revisable, abstract, but referential knowledge of the world that can be expressed through metaphors and models. During the 1970s Barbour presented a program of interdisciplinary courses that dealt with ethical issues in the applications of science, exploring the social and environmental consequences of a variety of technologies. In 2000 in When Science Meets Religion (2000) he used a fourfold typology (Conflict, Independence, Dialogue, Integration) to relate religion and science that he had developed in his earlier writings. In his works, Barbour writes from a Christian perspective. Barbour compared methods of inquiry in science and religion, and has explored the theological implications of Quantum gravity, Big Bang theory, Nebular hypothesis, geological time scale, abiogenesis, evolutionary history of life, and evolutionary psychology. He also has lectured widely on ethical issues in such fields as climate change, technology policy, energy, agriculture, computers, and cloning. Forrest Clingerman ties Barbour to the religious naturalism movement via his theology of nature. His subjective/objective approach to religious is prominent in this evolving paradigm. Michael Dowd calls Barbour the grandfather of the evolutionary Christianity movement.Grandddaddy of Evolutionary Christianity retrieved April 15, 2011 In his acceptance speech for the 1999 Templeton Prize, Barbour spoke about the need to break down barriers, using cloning as an example of science's ability to say what is possible and of religion to reflect on what is desirable.

Notes may be sounded in combination (producing harmony) or in succession (melody). The lithophone is an idiophone comparable to instruments such as the glockenspiel, vibraphone, xylophone and marimba. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, lithophones are designated as '111.22' - directly-struck percussion plaques. Notable examples * A rudimentary form of lithophone is the \\"rock gong\\", usually a natural rock formation opportunistically adapted to produce musical tones, such as that on Mfangano Island, in Lake Victoria, Kenya. The Great Stalacpipe Organ of Luray Caverns, Virginia, USA uses 37 stalactites to produce the Western scale. Another stalactite lithophone is to be found at Tenkasi in South India. Ringing Rocks Park in Pennsylvania is another well known lithophone. * A typical Basque instrument named Txalaparta (or Chalaparta) can be made of wood or stone, but is traditionally made of wood A more sophisticated lithophone trims and mounts individual stones to achieve a full- scale idiophone: * Probable prehistoric lithophone stones have been found at Sankarjang in Odisha, India.

They were introduced by the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, used for political and terrorism-related cases during the Troubles, and abolished by the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. Non-jury trial remains possible in Northern Ireland on a case-by-case certification rather than automatically applying for scheduled offences. Description Technically, the Diplock court was not a specially constituted court, but rather an ordinary criminal court before a single judge. From 1991 the relevant court was the Crown Court;Currently Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 s.4; previously Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1991 s.9(1); Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 s.10(1); Terrorism Act 2000 s.74 as enacted and as amended by Constitutional Reform Act 2005 Sch.4 par.288(2) before that it was the Belfast City CommissionNorthern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 s.6(1) (alternatively the Belfast Recorder's Court until that was abolished in 1975Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 s4; Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) (Amendment) Act 1975 s6(1)). A Diplock Crown Court usually sits in Belfast but the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland may direct a particular case, or class of cases, or part of a case, to be heard elsewhere. The list of scheduled offences required to be tried by Diplock court included: * the common law offences of murder, manslaughter, arson, and riot. * statutory offences relating to explosives, firearms, rioting, and subversion, as defined under the Malicious Damage Act 1861, Offences against the Person Act 1861, Explosive Substances Act 1883, and several acts passed in 1968 and 1969 in response to the outbreak of the Troubles. For some scheduled offences, the Attorney General for Northern Ireland could specify a jury trial of a particular case, so that for example a non-political murder would not use the Diplock courts. History The courts were established in response to a report submitted to the UK Parliament in December 1972 by Lord Diplock,Report of the Commission to Consider Legal Procedures to deal with Terrorist Activities in Northern Ireland (Cmmd. 5185); full text of the Diplock Report which addressed the problem of dealing with physical force Irish republicanism through means other than internment (which had been implemented in August 1971). In his report, Diplock cited two primary reasons for his determination that jury trials should be suspended # danger of perverse acquittals, and, # jurors had been threatened, \\"of which we have had ample evidence\\".Report of the Commission to consider legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities in Northern Ireland, Lord Diplock, H.M.S.O., 1972, page 17 Lord Gardiner's Minority Report as part of the Parker Report in March 1972 found \\"no evidence of [intimidation] or of perversity in juries\\".Greer & White: Abolishing The Diplock Courts, page 91: Report of a Committee to consider, in the context of civil liberties and human rights, measures to deal with terrorism in Northern Ireland, Lord Gardener. The report marked the beginning of the policy of \\"criminalisation\\",Donohue, Laura (2007): Counter Terrorist Law and Emergency Powers in the United Kingdom 1922‚Äì2000, S. 155 whereby the State removed legal distinctions between political violence and normal crime, with political prisoners treated as common criminals. The report provided the basis for the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, which, although later amended (with the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 and subsequent renewals), continued as the basis for counter-terrorist legislation in the UK. Two years later, Lord Gardiner's review of the removal of trial by jury included attempts to bolster Diplock's findings as follows: > We are convinced on the evidence that we have received, that if juries were > to be reintroduced for scheduled offences, their verdicts would still be > subject to the influences of intimidation, or the fear of it. We have no > evidence of this or of perversity in juries...Greer & White: Abolishing the > Diplock Courts, page 91. The establishment of the Diplock Courts can be seen as an early, and successful, example of the Provisional Irish Republican Army's (IRA's) long- term aim of making \\"the Six Counties... ungovernable except by colonial military rule\\". This was a central pillar of the \\"Long War\\" strategy set out in the 1977 Green Book.The Long War: The IRA and Sinn F√©in, Brendan O'Brien, Syracuse University Press, page 23. Diplock courts mainly tried republican or loyalist paramilitaries. In the first case in which a person not associated with the Troubles was tried and convicted, Abbas Boutrab, a suspected al-Qaeda sympathiser, was found guilty of having information that could assist bombing an airliner.\\"Al-Qaeda terror suspect convicted\\", BBC News Online, 24 November 2005 A sentence of six years was handed down on 20 December 2005.\\"Al-Qaeda terror suspect is jailed\\", BBC News Online, 20 December 2005 Conviction rates in Diplock courts were not appreciably higher than in jury trials. Between 1984 and 1986 the conviction rate was 51%, compared to 49% for jury trials in Northern Ireland and 50% in England and Wales. The number of cases heard in Diplock courts reached a peak of 329 yearly in the mid-1980s. With the Northern Ireland peace process and paramilitary ceasefires of the latter 1990s, that figure fell to 60 a year in the mid-2000s. , Northern Ireland Office consultation paper, August 2006 The 1998 Good Friday Agreement underpinning the peace process included a British commitment to \\"security normalisation\\" including abolition of Diplock courts. Sinn F√©in pressed for this in the agreement negotiations, arguing that lack of juries denied accused republicans of the right to a fair trial. On 1 August 2005, the Northern Ireland Office announced that the Diplock courts were to be phased out, and in August 2006 they announced that the courts were to be abolished effective July 2007. This was achieved under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. Post-2007 non-jury trials The Criminal Justice Act 2003, applicable throughout the UK, allows jury-less trials in complex fraud cases (s.43) and where there is a risk of jury tampering (s.44).\\"Jury trials 'to become the norm'\\", BBC News Online, 11 August 2006 The Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 abolished the idea of \\"scheduled offences\\" automatically tried without a jury. Instead it allows for the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland to certify a non-jury trial for any indictable offence provided it was committed either from a motive of \\"religious or political hostility\\" or by on behalf of a group which is both proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and \\"connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland\\". The act seeks to address the concerns which led to the establishment of Diplock courts by enhancing jurors' anonymity to prevent intimidation, and increasing randomised juror selection to prevent bias. The Northern Ireland Office's explanatory notes for the 2007 act characterise its changes as \\"repeal\\" of \\"the Diplock system\\" and its replacement with \\"a new system of non-jury trial\\". On the other hand, courts in such trials have much the same format as the pre-2007 Diplock courts, and have been called \\"Diplock courts\\" in the media.

It is the largest secondary school library in the world, containing 160,000 volumes over nine levels with a shelf capacity of 250,000 volumes. When it became clear in the 1950s that the library had outgrown its existing building, the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional design for the new building. Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design, the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965. The library opened in 1971. In 1997 the library received the Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects, an award that recognizes architecture of enduring significance that is given to no more than one building per year. Kahn structured the library in three concentric square rings. The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior walls and the library carrel desks immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks. History and services The first library at Phillips Exeter Academy was a single small room. A member of the class of 1833 remembered it as containing \\"old sermons and some history, scarcely ever read\\". Even as late as 1905 the library had only two rooms and 2,000 volumes. Exeter Library atrium with crossbeams above and circular staircase below In 1912 the Davis Library was added to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its atmosphere was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located at the entrance to the stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian. In 1950 Rodney Armstrong became librarian, the first with a graduate degree in library science. One of his first moves was to open the stacks to students. That solved one problem, but the real difficulty was the lack of space. The library contained 35,000 volumes at that point, many of them stored in cardboard boxes for lack of shelf room. After years of effort, Armstrong eventually succeeded in bringing a new library to the academy. Architect Louis Kahn was chosen to design the new library in 1965, and it was ready for occupancy in 1971. Architectural historian Vincent Scully acknowledged its architectural significance by using a photo of it as the frontispiece for his book Modern Architecture and Other Essays. On November 16, 1971, classes were suspended for a day, and students, faculty, and staff moved books (the library had 60,000 volumes by this time) from the old Davis Library into the new library. Henry Bedford, who became librarian shortly after the new library was occupied, supervised the transition not only to the new building but also to a new way of operating a library. Staff librarians were encouraged to see themselves as co-instructors with the regular faculty and to put less emphasis on shushing library patrons. A piano was installed and the library began sponsoring lectures and concerts. In 1977 Jacquelyn Thomas became the first librarian with full faculty status. By 2006 she oversaw a staff of seven, all with graduate degrees in library science. During Thomas' tenure the library's collection and programming grew to a size appropriate to a small liberal arts college. Today the library houses 160,000 volumes on nine levels and has a shelf capacity of 250,000 volumes, making it the largest secondary school library in the world. The library also contains a collection of works by alumni as well as the Academy Archives. The library was the first building on campus to be computerized thanks to the foresight of Armstrong and Kahn, who supplied the library with sufficient conduit space for the cabling needed by the coming computer revolution. In 1995, the library was officially named the Class of 1945 Library, honoring Dr. Lewis Perry, Exeter's eighth principal, who served from 1914 to 1946. Choosing Louis Kahn as architect Diagonal view across Exeter Library atrium, including grand piano used for occasional concerts The project to build a new and larger library began in 1950 and progressed slowly for several years. By the mid-1960s, O'Connor & Kilham, the architectural firm that had designed libraries for Barnard, Amherst and West Point, had been chosen to design the new library and had drafted plans with traditional architecture. Richard Day arrived as the new principal of the academy at that point, however, and found their design to be unsatisfactory. He dismissed them, declaring his intention to hire \\"the very best contemporary architect in the world to design our library\\". The school's building committee was tasked with finding a new architect. Influential members of the committee became interested in Louis Kahn at an early stage, but they interviewed several other prominent architects as well, including Paul Rudolph, I. M. Pei, Philip Johnson and Edward Larrabee Barnes. Kahn's prospects received a boost when Jonas Salk, whose son had attended Exeter, called Armstrong and invited him to visit the Salk Institute in California, which Kahn had recently built to widespread acclaim. Kahn was awarded the commission for the library in November 1965. Kahn had already thought deeply about the proper design for a library, having earlier submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. He also expressed a deep reverence for books, saying, \\"A book is tremendously important. Nobody ever paid the price of a book, they only paid for the printing\\". Describing the book as an offering, Kahn said, \\"How precious a book is in light of the offering, in light of the one who has the privilege of the offering. The library tells you of this offering\\". (as quoted in Robert McCarter's Louis I. Kahn, page 304) The building committee carefully considered what they wanted in a new library and presented their ideas to Kahn in an unusually detailed document that went through more than fifty drafts. The early designs included some items that were eventually rejected, such as a roof garden and two exterior towers with stairs that were open to the weather. They were removed from the plans when the building committee reminded Kahn that neither of those features would be practical in New England winters. Architecture The library has an almost cubical shape: each of its four sides is 111 feet (33 m) wide and 80 feet (24 m) tall. It is constructed in three concentric areas (which Kahn called \\"doughnuts\\"). In the words of Robert McCarter, author of Louis I. Kahn, \\"From the very beginning of the design process, Kahn conceived of the three types of spaces as if they were three buildings constructed of different materials and of different scales ‚Äì buildings-within-buildings\\". The outer area, which houses the reading carrels, is made of brick. The middle area, which contains the heavy book stacks, is made of reinforced concrete. The inner area is an atrium. The library's heating and cooling needs are supplied by the nearby dining hall, which Kahn built at the same time as the library, but which is considered to be of less architectural significance. Exterior Exeter Library exterior The building committee's document specified that the new library should be \\"unpretentious, though in a handsome, inviting contemporary style\\". Kahn accordingly made the building's exterior relatively undramatic, suitable for a small New England town. Its facade is primarily brick with teak wood panels at most windows marking the location of a pair of wooden carrels. The bricks are load-bearing; that is, the weight of the outer portion of the building is carried by the bricks themselves, not by a hidden steel frame. Kahn calls this fact to the viewer's attention by making the brick piers noticeably thicker at the bottom where they have more weight to bear. The windows are correspondingly wider toward the top where the piers are thinner. Kahn said, \\"The weight of the brick makes it dance like a fairy above and groan below.\\" The corners of the building are chamfered (cut off), allowing the viewers to see the outer parts of the building's structure, the outer \\"doughnut.\\" The Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects says, \\"Kahn sometimes perceived a building as enclosed by 'plate-walls,' and to give emphasis to this structural form, he interrupted the plates at the corner, leaving a gap between them. The Library at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire (1967‚Äì1972) is a classic example\\". Each of these four brick \\"plate-walls,\\" which house the library carrels, is 16 feet (4.9 m) deep. At the top of the exterior walls is a row of openings similar to the windows below except that these openings are above the roof and have no glass. Vincent Scully said that Kahn was drawn to architecture based on \\"solid, almost primitive, masonry masses with voids in them without glass.\\" The bottoms of these window-like openings are 6 feet (1.8 m) above the floor of an arcade that follows the perimeter of the top of building. Another arcade circles the building on the ground floor. Kahn disliked the idea of a building that was dominated by its entrance, so he concealed the main entrance to the library behind this arcade. His original design, however, called for landscaping with a paved forecourt that would have indicated the entrance without disrupting the symmetry of the facade. Architectural historian William Jordy said, \\"Perverse as the hidden entrance may seem, it emphatically reinforces Kahn's statement that his design begins on the periphery with the circle of individual carrels, each with its separate window.\\" Interior A circular double staircase built from concrete and faced with travertine greets the visitor upon entry into the library. At the top of the stairs the visitor enters a dramatic central hall with enormous circular openings that reveal several floors of book stacks. At the top of the atrium, two massive concrete cross beams diffuse the light entering from the clerestory windows. Carter Wiseman, author of Louis Kahn: Beyond Time and Style, said, \\"The many comparisons of the experience of entering Exeter's main space to that of entering a cathedral are not accidental. Kahn clearly wanted the students to be humbled by the sense of arrival, and he succeeded.\\" David Rineheart, who worked as an architect for Kahn, said, \\"for Lou, every building was a temple. Salk was a temple for science. Dhaka was a temple for government. Exeter was a temple for learning.\\" Because the stacks are visible from the floor of the central hall, the layout of the library is clear to the visitor at a glance, which was one of the goals the academy's building committee had set for Kahn. The central room is 52 feet (15.8 m) high, as measured from the floor to the beginning of the roof structure, and 32 feet (9.8 m) wide. Those dimensions approximate a ratio known as the golden ratio, which was studied by the ancient Greeks and has been considered the ideal architectural ratio for centuries. The circle and the square that are combined so dramatically in the atrium were considered to be the paradigmatic geometric units by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. He also noted that the human body is proportioned so that it can fit in both shapes, a concept that was famously expressed with a combined circle and square by Leonardo da Vinci in his drawing Vitruvian Man.The topic was repeatedly raised by Kahn in several projects. The outer part of the building, which houses the carrels, is built of load-bearing brick. Each carrel floor spans two levels of book stacks. The specifications of the academy's building committee called for a large number of carrels (the library has 210) and for the carrels to be placed near windows so they could receive natural light. The latter point matched Kahn's personal inclinations exactly because he himself strongly preferred natural light: \\"He is also known to have worked by a window, refusing to switch on an electric light even on the darkest of days.\\" Each pair of carrels has a large window above, and each individual carrel has a small window at desk height with a sliding panel for adjusting the light. The placement of carrel spaces at the periphery was the product of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks on the periphery of the library and reading rooms toward the center. Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, the essence of a library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window for a closer look: \\"A man with a book goes to the light. A library begins that way. He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light.\\" Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels. This arrangement of numbered floors and mezzanines (B, G, 1, 1M, 2, 2M, 3, 3M, 4) elegantly skirted the town code limiting buildings to four stories. The book stacks also look out into the atrium. The inherent massiveness of the brick \\"plate-wall\\" structure of the outer part of the library helps to create the cloistered atmosphere that Kahn felt was appropriate for library carrels. While explaining his proposal for the library at Washington University, Kahn had used the example of the cloistered carrels at the monastic library at Dunham, England, to explain his \\"desire to find a space construction system in which the carrels were inherent in the support which harbored them ... Wall-bearing masonry construction with its niches and vaults has the appealing structural order to provide naturally such spaces.\\" Architectural interpretations Massive cross beams that diffuse the light at the top of the atrium Architectural experts sometimes differ in their interpretations of Kahn's design. For example, in reasoning why the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium are so massive, Carter Wiseman says, \\"While they appear to be‚Äîand indeed are‚Äîstructural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight coming in from the surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium.\\" Sarah Williams Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that \\"the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect.\\" Kathleen James- Chakraborty goes even further: \\"Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details.\\" Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier. The library is also often discussed in comparison with contemporary sacred buildings. The plans have some characteristics of Vasrtu Purusha Mandala as well as other symbolic forms that allow various symbolic interpretations. Another issue is the extent to which Kahn deliberately introduced elements into some of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins. Kahn himself spoke of \\"wrapping ruins around buildings\\", although in the context of another project. In his essay \\"Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome\\", Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings, including this library, saying, \\"And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Kahn won't even let it become a building; he wants it to remain a ruin. The walls don't connect at the top. They remain like a hollow shell\\". Romaldo Giurgola, on the other hand, avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects. In it, while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh, Giurgola wrote, \\"This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution, rather than the formal desire to 'create ruins,' as some critics have suggested.\\" In the very next paragraph Guirgola describes the chamfered corners of the library by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter Library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials. Recognition *In 1997 the American Institute of Architects gave the library their Twenty-five Year Award for architecture of enduring significance, which is given to no more than one building per year. *In 2005 the United States Postal Service issued a stamp that recognized the library as one of twelve Masterworks of Modern American Architecture. *In 2007, the library was ranked #80 on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.

Reed followed many of the prominent Bolshevik leaders closely during his time in Russia. John Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished, and he is one of the few Americans buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow, a site normally reserved only for the most prominent Soviet leaders. Concept and creation John Reed was on an assignment for The Masses, a magazine of socialist politics, when he was reporting the Russian Revolution. Although Reed states that he had \\"tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth\\" during the time of the event, he stated in the preface that \\"in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral\\" (since the book primarily shares the perspective of the Russian working class). Before John Reed left for Russia, the Espionage Act was passed on June 15, 1917, which fined and imprisoned anyone who interfered with the recruiting of soldiers and prohibited the mailing of any newspaper or magazine that promoted such sentiments. The U.S. Post Office was also given leave to deny any mailing that fitted these standards from further postal delivery, and then to disqualify a magazine because it had missed a mailing (due to the ban) and hence was no longer considered a \\"regular publication.\\" Because of this, The Masses was forced by the United States federal government to cease publication in the fall of 1917 after refusing to change the magazine's policy against World War I. The Liberator, founded by Max Eastman under his and his sister's private control, published Reed's articles concerning the Russian Revolution instead. In an effort to ensure the magazine's survival, Eastman compromised and tempered its views accordingly. Upon returning from Russia during April 1918 via Kristiania in Norway, after being barred from either traveling to the United States or returning to Russia since February 23 by the United States Department of State, Reed's trunk of notes and materials on the revolution‚Äîwhich included Russian handbills, newspapers, and speeches‚Äîwere seized by custom officials, who interrogated him for four hours over his activities in Russia during the previous eight months. Michael Gold, an eyewitness to Reed's arrival to Manhattan, recalls how \\"a swarm of Department of Justice men stripped him, went over every inch of his clothes and baggage, and put him through the usual inquisition. Reed had been sick with ptomaine on the boat. The inquisition had also been painful.\\" Back home during mid-summer 1918, Reed, worried that \\"his vivid impressions on the revolution would fade,\\" fought hard to regain his papers from the possession of the government, who refused to return them. Reed did not receive his materials until seven months later in November. Max Eastman recalls a meeting with John Reed in the middle of Sheridan Square during the period of time when Reed isolated himself writing the book: Critical response Ten Days That Shook the World has received mixed responses since its publication in 1919, resulting in a wide range of critical reviews from negative to positive. However, the book was overall positively received by critics at the time of its first publication, despite some critics‚Äô vocal opposition to Reed‚Äôs political beliefs. George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and historian who was strongly opposed to Bolshevism and is best known as ‚Äúthe father of containment,‚Äù praised the book: ‚ÄúReed‚Äôs account of the events of that time rises above every other contemporary record for its literary power, its penetration, its command of detail‚Äù and would be ‚Äúremembered when all others are forgotten.‚Äù Kennan saw it as ‚Äúa reflection of blazing honesty and a purity of idealism that did unintended credit to the American society that produced him, the merits of which he himself understood so poorly.‚Äù In 1999, The New York Times reported New York University‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop 100 Works of Journalism,‚Äù works published in the United States in the 20th century, placed Ten Days that Shook the World in seventh position. Project director Mitchell Stephens explains the judges‚Äô decision: Not all responses were positive. Joseph Stalin argued in 1924 that Reed was misleading in regards to Leon Trotsky.Trotskyism or Leninism? The book portrays Trotsky (head of the Red Army) as a man who co-led the revolution with Lenin and mentions Stalin only twice‚Äîone of them being only in the recitation of a list of names. Russian writer Anatoly Rybakov elaborates on Stalinist Soviet Union‚Äôs ban on Ten Days that Shook the World: ‚ÄúThe main task was to build a mighty socialist state. For that, mighty power was needed. Stalin was at the head of that power, which means that he stood at its source with Lenin. Together with Lenin he led the October Revolution. John Reed had presented the history of October differently. That wasn‚Äôt the John Reed we needed.‚Äù After Stalin‚Äôs death, the book was allowed to recirculate. Publication Cover of the 1922 German edition of 10 Days That Shook The World, published by the Comintern in Hamburg.'' After its first publication, Reed returned to Russia in the fall of 1919, delighted to learn that Vladimir Lenin had taken time to read the book. Furthermore, Lenin agreed to write an introduction that first appeared in the 1922 edition published by Boni & Liveright (New York): In his introduction to Animal Farm titled \\"Freedom of the Press\\" (1945),George Orwell, \\"The Freedom of the Press, Orwell's Proposed Preface to Animal Farm\\", online: orwell.ru/library George Orwell claims that the British Communist Party published a version omitting Lenin's introduction and mention of Trotsky:  Sequel  In the book, Reed refers several times to a planned sequel, titled Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk, which was not finished. Film adaptations In 1928, Sergei Eisenstein filmed the book as October: Ten Days That Shook the World. In 1967, Granada Television presented a feature-length version of the events with the same title, narrated by Orson Welles.Ten Days That Shook the World in the National Library of Australia (which apparently lists/conflates its date of acquisition with the actual year of production). It's also on You Tube in its entirety free. John Reed's own exploits and parts of the book itself were the basis of the 1981 Warren Beatty film Reds. In 1982, the Soviet film maker Sergei Bondarchuk used the book as the basis of his film Red Bells (its alternative title is Ten Days that Shook the World).

Approximately one year earlier, on June 15, 1940, the Red Army invaded Lithuania and the unpopular Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was soon established. Political repression and terror were used to silence its critics and suppress any resistance. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, a diverse segment of the Lithuanian population rose up against the Soviet regime, declared renewed independence, and formed the short-lived Provisional Government. Two large Lithuanian cities, Kaunas and Vilnius, fell into the hands of the rebels before the arrival of the Wehrmacht. Within a week, the German Army took control of the whole of Lithuania. The Lithuanians greeted the Germans as liberators from the repressive Soviet rule and hoped that the Germans would re-establish their independence or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the Slovak Republic). No such support came from the Nazis, who steadily replaced Lithuanian institutions with their own administration. The Reichskommissariat Ostland was established at the end of July 1941. Deprived of any real power, the Provisional Government disbanded itself on August 5. Background and preparations In 1918, Lithuania achieved independence in the aftermath of the First World War and the Russian revolution and secured its statehood during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. Initially prior to World War II, Lithuania declared neutrality and its Seimas passed the neutrality laws. Though, on the eve of World War II, as the geopolitical situation in the region started to change, Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatums of the neighboring countries. On 17 March 1938, Poland delivered an ultimatum calling for diplomatic relations. Although practically it meant Poland's \\"refusal\\" of Vilnius, Lithuania had also sought to restore relations with its neighbor, and accepted the ultimatum. On 20 March 1939, Lithuania was handed an ultimatum by Nazi Germany. A request was made to transfer the Klaipƒóda Region to Nazi Germany. Two days later, without seeing the way out, the Lithuanian government signed the agreement. Just after the beginning of the World War II, on September 2, 1939, the Lithuanian Consulate was opened in Vilnius. The consulate was the first in the world to grant Visas For Life for the Jews and also saved many Polish war refugees. By doing so, Lithuania continued to actively protect its Jewish citizens from the Holocaust. Back in 1934 it sent an official note to Nazi Germany warning not to take action against the Jews who resided in the country that were citizens of Lithuania. Lithuanian delegation before departing to Moscow, where they later were tactically forced to sign the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty Another large neighbor ‚Äî the Soviet Union also began preparing for the occupation of the Lithuania's territory. On 7 October 1939 the Lithuanian delegation departed to Moscow where they later had to sign the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty due to the unfavorable situation. The treaty resulted in five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops established across Lithuania in exchange for the Lithuania's historical capital Vilnius. According to the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Kazys Musteikis, Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb≈°ys initially told that Lithuanians refuses Vilnius Region as well as the Russian garrisons, however then nervous Joseph Stalin replied that \\"No matter if you take Vilnius or not, the Russian garrisons will enter Lithuania anyway\\". He also informed Juozas Urb≈°ys about the Soviet‚ÄìGerman secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence. Two of the military bases with thousands of Soviet soldiers were established close to Kaunas in Prienai and Gai≈æi≈´nai. Despite regaining the beloved historical capital, the Presidency and the Government remained in Kaunas. Presidential Palace in Kaunas, where the last meeting of the independent Government of Lithuania took place on the night of 14 June 1940 The next step made by the USSR was accusations of the abduction of the Red Army soldiers in Lithuania. Although the Lithuanian government denied such allegations, the tensions became heightened on both sides. On 14 June 1940, the USSR issued an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding to replace the government and allow Red Army's units to enter the territory of Lithuania without any prior agreements, which would mean the occupation of the country. On 14 June 1940 just before midnight, the last meeting of the Lithuanian Government was held in the Presidential Palace, in Kaunas. During it, the Soviet's ultimatum was debated. President Antanas Smetona categorically declined to accept most of the ultimatum demands, argued for military resistance and was supported by Kazys Musteikis, , , however the Commander of the Armed Forces Vincas Vitkauskas, Divisional general Stasys Ra≈°tikis, Kazys Bizauskas, Antanas Merkys and most of the Lithuanian Government members decided that it would be impossible, especially due to the previously stationed Soviet soldiers, and accepted the ultimatum. On that night, the Soviet forces executed Lithuanian border guard near the Byelorussian SSR border. In the morning, the Lithuanian Government resigned while the president left the country to avoid the fate of the Soviet's puppet and hoping to form the Government in exile. Soon the Red Army flooded Lithuania through the Belarus‚ÄìLithuania border with more than 200,000 soldiers and took control of the most important cities, including Kaunas where the heads of state resided. The Lithuanian Armed Forces were ordered not to resist and the Lithuanian Air Force remained on the ground. At the time, the Lithuanian Armed Forces had 26,084 soldiers (of which 1,728 officers) and 2,031 civil servants. While the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, subordinate to the army commander, had over 62,000 members of which about 70% were farmers and agricultural workers. After the occupation, the Soviets had immediately taken brutal actions against the high-ranking officials of the state. Both targets of the ultimatum: the Minister of the Interior Kazys Skuƒças and the Director of the State Security Department of Lithuania Augustinas Povilaitis were transported to Moscow and later executed. Antanas Gustaitis, Kazys Bizauskas, Vytautas Petrulis, , , also faced the fate of execution, while President Aleksandras Stulginskis, Juozas Urb≈°ys, Leonas Bistras, Antanas Merkys, Pranas Dovydaitis, Petras Klimas, Donatas Malinauskas and thousands of others were deported. Stasys Ra≈°tikis, persuaded by his wife, secretly crossed the German border. After realizing it, NKVD started terror against Ra≈°tikis' family. His wife was separated from their 1-year-old daughter and brutally interrogated at Kaunas Prison, and his father Bernardas Ra≈°tikis, three daughters, two brothers and sister were deported to Siberia. Soldiers, officers, senior officers and generals of the Lithuanian Army and LRU members, who were seen as a threat to the occupants, were quickly arrested, interrogated and released to the reserve, deported to the concentration camps or executed, trying to avoid this many joined the Lithuanian partisans forces. The army itself was firstly renamed to the Lithuanian People's Army, however later it was reorganized to the 29th Rifle Corps of the Soviet Union. Soviet political leader (without military shoulder straps) and the puppet People's Seimas member (with red rose in his jacket lapel) announces to the Lithuanian People's Army non-commissioned officers that \\"soon you will become members of the Red Army\\" in Kaunas, 1940 Sovietization was started right away. New power banned opposition, its press, and organizations and also restricted ties with foreign countries. Shortly, on 17 June 1940 the puppet People's Government of Lithuania was formed, which consistently destroyed Lithuanian society, political institutions and opened the way for the Communist Party to establish itself. In order to establish the legitimacy of the government and design the plans of Lithuania's \\"legal accession to the USSR\\", on July 1, the Seimas of Lithuania was released and the forced elections with falsified results to the People's Seimas were organized, which were won by the Lithuanian Labor People's Union and Justas Paleckis was chosen as the illegal Prime Minister and President of Lithuania. The new government obeyed the occupiers' proposal to \\"ask\\" the Soviet authorities to have Lithuania admitted to the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian nation was unable to resist the implementation of Sovietization, including nationalization, nor prevent the mass arrests of political activists and others dubbed \\"enemies of the people\\". Nor could they prevent the closing of all cultural, religious and political organizations. The economic situation steadily worsened and the standard of living decreased. A year later, just a week before the uprising, some 17,000 Lithuanians, mainly the intelligentsia, were taken with their entire families and deported to Siberia, where many perished due to inhumane living conditions (see the June deportation). It was the single major event that incited popular support for the uprising. That tragedy initially also garnered a positive predisposition toward the German invasion. People who escaped the deportations or arrests spontaneously organized themselves into armed groups, hid in the forests, and waited for a wider uprising.Anu≈°auskas (2005), pp. 157‚Äì158 The ultimate goal of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), formed in the fall of 1940, was to re- establish Lithuania's independence. Commanded by Kazys ≈†kirpa in Berlin, the LAF sought to unify Lithuanian resistance, and organize and conserve resources for the planned uprising against the Soviets.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 157 It acted as an umbrella organizationBubnys (1998), p. 26 and many groups used the name of LAF even though they were not connected with the LAF in Berlin.Bubnys (1998), p. 27 The LAF established its military‚Äìpolitical headquarters in Vilnius and organizational headquarters in Kaunas. The communication and coordination between these centers in Berlin, Kaunas, and Vilnius was rather poor. The headquarters in Vilnius suffered heavily from Soviet arrests, especially in early June 1941, and became largely defunct.Bubnys (1998), p. 32 Most of those arrested activists were executed in December 1941, in Russia. In March 1941, the LAF in Berlin published a memorandum, titled Brang≈´s vergaujantieji broliai (Dear Enslaved Brothers), with instructions on how to prepare for the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 167 The rebels were asked to secure strategic objects (prisons, railroads, bridges, communication hubs, factories, etc.), guarding them from potential sabotage by the retreating Red Army, while Central Headquarters would organize a Provisional Government and declare independence.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 168 In April, a list of the members of the Provisional Government, which would declare Lithuanian independence, was compiled.Bubnys (1998), p. 29 The Prime Minister's post was reserved for ≈†kirpa, four ministers were from Vilnius, six from Kaunas, and one from Berlin. The members represented a wide spectrum of pre-war political parties and, as such, claimed to represent a majority of the Lithuanian people.Misiunas (1993), p. 46 It has been suggested that not all of the designated Ministers knew about their proposed appointments in the Provisional Government. On June 14, the Nazi authorities in Berlin insisted that ≈†kirpa and his activists not form any government or make any public declarations without their prior approval. ≈†kirpa agreed to this, but he had very little control over the activists in Lithuania itself. June Revolt=German advances and Soviet retreat Soviet POWs escorted by German soldiers in Vilnius, June‚ÄìJuly 1941 At 3:15 am on June 22, the territory of the Lithuanian SSR was invaded by two advancing German army groups: Army Group North, which took over western and northern Lithuania, and Army Group Centre, which took over most of the Vilnius Region. The Germans amassed some 40 divisions, 700,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, and 1,200 airplanes for the attack on the Lithuanian SSR.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 161 The Soviets had about 25 divisions, 400,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, and 1,344 airplanes in the Baltic Military District. 7 rifle and 6 motorized divisions from the 8th and 11th Armies were located within the Lithuanian territory. The first attacks were carried out by Luftwaffe against airports, airfields, and Lithuanian cities (Kƒódainiai, Raseiniai, Karmƒólava, Panevƒó≈æys, Jurbarkas, Ukmergƒó, ≈†iauliai, and others). These attacks claimed the lives of some 4,000 civilians.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 162 Most of the Soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground (322 airplanes were lost in air versus 1,489 destroyed on ground). The Germans rapidly advanced forward encountering only sporadic resistance from the Soviets near Kaltinƒónai, Raseiniai, ≈†iauliai and assistance from the Lithuanians. In the Battle of Raseiniai, the Soviets attempted to mount a counterattack, reinforced by tanks, but suffered heavy losses.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 163 Within a week, the Germans sustained 3,362 casualties, but controlled the entirety of Lithuania.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 164 Soviet losses were heavy and not known precisely; the estimates put them at 12‚Äì15 divisions. The Red Army also lost numerous aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other equipment.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 165 Despite the generally friendly Lithuanian attitude, the Germans carried out several punitive executions. For example, 42 civilians from Ablinga village were murdered in response to German deaths. After two German guards in Alytus were shot by unknown perpetrators, the Nazis shot 42 Lithuanian rebels.Anu≈°auskas (2005), pp. 166‚Äì167 The terror in Alytus continued to the next day: the Germans selected men, age 15‚Äì50, and executed them in groups of 20‚Äì25. More atrocities were carried out by the retreating Red Army. About 4,000 political and criminal prisoners, arrested during the first Soviet occupation, were to be transported to Russia.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 141 NKVD organized prisoner massacres in Rainiai, Pravieni≈°kƒós, Panevƒó≈æys. A total of 40 locations of mass killings have been identified in Lithuania.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 142 Many others were killed en route to Soviet prisons. The largest such massacre took place near Chervyen in present-day Belarus. A list of NKVD victims in Lithuania, compiled during the Nazi occupation, includes 769 people that did not participate in the uprising.Bubnys (1998), pp. 45‚Äì46 Lithuanian revoltIn Kaunas= LAF activists leads the arrested Commissar of the Red Army in Kaunas LAF activists inspects the deprived T-38 tank from the Red Army in Kaunas Lithuanian activists in Kaunas on June 25, 1941 Lithuanian rebels leads the disarmed Red Army soldiers in Kaunas After the occupation, the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service did not recognize the new occupant's authority and started the diplomatic liberation campaign of Lithuania. In 1941, Kazys ≈†kirpa, Leonas Prapuolenis, Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius and their supporters, including the former Commander of the Lithuanian Army General Stasys Ra≈°tikis, whose wife was separated from their 1-year-old daughter and brutally interrogated by the Soviets at Kaunas Prison, and his father Bernardas Ra≈°tikis, three daughters, two brothers and sister were deported to Siberia, began organizing an uprising. The uprising began in early morning of June 22, 1941, the first day of the war. The main forces of the LAF were concentrated in Kaunas. At 10 am LAF held a meeting in ≈Ωaliakalnis, dividing the responsibilities. It was decided that the main goal is not to fight with the Russians, but to secure the city from inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence.Bubnys (1998), p. 34 By the evening of June 22, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, radio station and radiophone. Control of the telephone allowed Lithuanians to disconnect all known communist numbers and talk to each other without passwords or codes. The radio station was sabotaged by the Russians, therefore repair works were carried out during the night from June 22 to 23. Spare parts were delivered by medical students, driving an ambulance.Bubnys (1998), p. 35 Despite fears of inadequate Lithuanian forces guarding the radio, in the morning of June 23, Leonas Prapuolenis read the declaration of Lithuanian independence and the list of members of the Provisional Government. The broadcast was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French. At 9:28 AM Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó, the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. Many people listened to the Lithuanian national anthem with tears in their eyes. Multiple Red Army divisions stationed in the Lithuania's territory, including the brutal 1st Motor Rifle Division NKVD responsible for the June deportation, and the puppet Lithuanian SSR regime commanders were forced to flee into the Latvian SSR through the Daugava river. Commander of the Red Army's 188th Rifle Division colonel Piotr Ivanov reported to the 11th Army Staff that during the retreat of his division through Kaunas \\"local counterrevolutionaries from the shelters purposefully and severely fired to the Red Army, the flocks suffered heavy losses of soldiers and military equipment\\". In the morning of June 23, 1941, the rebels raided Soviet armories in ≈†anƒçiai,Bubnys (1998), p. 36 Panemunƒó, and Vilijampolƒó.Gerutis (1984), p. 324 Now armed, Lithuanians spread throughout the city. The Vilijampolƒó Bridge across the Neris River received special attention from the rebels as they expected the Germans to enter the city using this bridge. When the Lithuanians got to the bridge, it was already wired with explosives. 40 Soviet troops and three armored vehicles protected the bridge and waited for the right moment to detonate. When the Soviets retreated a bit after facing Lithuanian fire, Juozas Savulionis ran to the middle of the bridge, cut the wires, and thus saved it from destruction. On his way back Savulionis was shot and killed by Soviet fire, becoming one of the first victims of the uprising. The bridges across the Neman River were prematurely destroyed by the retreating Soviets. This forced units of the Red Army in Suvalkija to bypass Kaunas and possibly saved the rebels in the city. The Metalas Factory became the headquarters of the ≈†anƒçiai rebels, who attempted to stop Russian soldiers from crossing the Neman River by boats or building a pontoon bridge. During these fights about 100 rebels were killed, 100 Soviet troops (including several officers) were taken prisoner, and a large booty of equipment (including three tanks but no one knew how to operate them) was captured.Gerutis (1984), p. 325 Other groups secured police stations, shops, warehouses, attempted to re-establish general order in the city. The rebels hastily organized their own police and freed some 2,000 political prisoners. They also organized publication of daily ƒÆ laisvƒô (Towards Freedom). On June 24, 1941, tank units of the Red Army in Jonava were ordered to retake Kaunas. The rebels radioed the Germans for assistance. The units were bombed by Luftwaffe and did not reach the city. It was the first coordinated Lithuanian‚ÄìGerman action.Gerutis (1984), pp. 325‚Äì326 The first German scouts, lieutenant Flohret and four privates, entered Kaunas on June 24 and found it in friendly hands.Bubnys (1998), p. 40 A day later the main forces marched into the city without obstruction and almost in a parade fashion.Misiunas (1993), p. 47 On June 26, German military command ordered to disband and disarm the rebel groups.Bubnys (1998), p. 38 Two days later Lithuanian guards and patrols were also relieved of their duties. According to self-registration in July, there were about 6,000 rebels, spontaneously organized into 26 groups in Kaunas.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 169 The largest groups numbered 200‚Äì250 men. Total Lithuanian casualties in Kaunas are estimated at 200 dead and 150 wounded.Bubnys (1998), p. 39 =In Vilnius= In Vilnius, LAF had been dismantled by Soviet arrests just before the war and Lithuanians formed only a small minority of the city's population. Therefore, the uprising was smaller in scale and started on June 23. The rebels took over the post office, radio station, and other institutions, and hoisted the Lithuanian flag over the Gediminas' Tower. It was relatively easy to take control of Vilnius as most units of the Red Army were located outside the city and retreated rather quickly. The first German units entered the city on June 24. The 7th Panzer Division, commanded by Hans Freiherr von Funck, expected that the Red Army would resist in Vilnius and made plans to bombard the city. There were about 7,000‚Äì8,000 of ethnic Lithuanians in the 29th Rifle Corps, formed after the dissolution of the Lithuanian Army in 1940.Bubnys (1998), p. 43 The majority of them deserted and started gathering in Vilnius from June 24. The 184th Rifle Division, dislocated near Varƒóna, was one of the first to face the advancing Germans.Gerutis (1984), p. 326 Taking advantage of chaos among the Russian officers, Lithuanians managed to separate from the main corps with only few losses and gathered in Vilnius. Only 745 soldiers of the 184th Rifle Division reached Russia.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 166 The 179th Rifle Division was ordered to retreat from Pabradƒó‚Äì≈†venƒçionƒóliai towards Pskov. On June 27, the division crossed the Lithuanian border and Lithuanian soldiers mutinied. At least 120 Lithuanians were killed in various shootouts while attempting to desert. About 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers (out of 6,000) of the 179th Rifle Division reached Nevel. Lithuanians hoped that these deserters would form the core of the new Lithuanian Army; however, the troops were organized into Police Battalions and employed by the Germans for their needs, including perpetrating the Holocaust. =Elsewhere and summary= Members of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union in Kruonis requests for more weapons to fight with communists and Russian soldiers who are terrorizing the local residents The uprising spread to other cities, towns, and villages. Level of the rebel activities varied greatly across Lithuania and the uprising was less organized, more spontaneous and chaotic. Men joined the uprising even though they never heard of the LAF or organized resistance in Kaunas. In most areas the rebels followed the pattern set in Kaunas and Vilnius: take control of local institutions (most importantly, the police) and secure other strategic objects. The rebels also arrested Soviet activists, freed political prisoners, and hoisted the Lithuanian flags. Lack of guns and ammunition was felt almost everywhere; the main way to obtain guns was to disarm surrendered Soviet troops.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 170 Most active rebels were in the districts of ≈†venƒçionys, Ma≈æeikiai, Panevƒó≈æys, and Utena.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 171 In some areas, like ≈†iauliai, there were no noticeable rebel activities. Once Germans entered a settlement they would disarm the rebels. However, some local institutions (police, various committees) de facto established by the rebels were later legalized de jure.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 176 During the Soviet era, the rebels were persecuted and the uprising was censored out of the history books. Memoirs and studies published mainly by Lithuanian-Americans inflated the total number of the Lithuanians activists to 90,000 or 113,000 and casualties to 2,000 or 6,000. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990 and new documents became available, historians have revised the estimates to 16,000‚Äì20,000 active participants and 600 casualties. Most of the rebels were young men, between 18 and 25 years old. Soviet losses are estimated at 5,000 men. Independence and Provisional Government Session of the Provisional Government of Lithuania under the chairmanship by Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius in Kaunas, Lithuania On June 23, 1941 at 9:28 AM Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó, the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. Many people listened to the Lithuanian national anthem then with tears in their eyes. LAF member Leonas Prapuolenis read independence declaration Atstatoma laisva Lietuva (Free Lithuania is Restored) ‚Äì \\"Young Lithuania with enthusiasm promises to add up to the Europe organization on the new bases. Lithuanian nation horribly tortured by bolshevik's terror braces creating its future on the ethnic unity and social justice\\".\\"Seimo Kronika\\", 23(162) pp. 5‚Äì7. Prapuolenis announced the members of the Provisional Government and also asked the people to guard public and private property, the workers to organize protection of factories, public institutions, and other important objects, and policemen to patrol their territories preserving the general public order. The message was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French. The first meeting of the Provisional Government took place on June 24. LAF activist Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius replaced Kazys ≈†kirpa, who was under house arrest in Berlin, as the Prime Minister. The new government attempted to take full control of the country, establish the proclaimed independence, and start a de-sovietization campaign. During its six-week existence over 100 laws, some prepared in advance, were issued, dealing with de-nationalization of land, enterprises, and real estate, restoration of local administrative units, formation of police, and other issues. The government did not have power in the Vilnius Region, under control of a different army group.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 175 Hoping to survive the government cooperated fully with the Nazi authorities. Participants of the last session of the Provisional Government of Lithuania, who signed a protest for the Germans actions of suspending the Lithuanian Government powers The Provisional Government of Lithuania strongly opposed the Holocaust carried out by the Nazis and its main goal was to protect the citizens and declare the Independence of Lithuania. It also tried to rescue the situation and protest, the meant Lithuanian Minister of National Defence General Stasys Ra≈°tikis (former Commander of the Lithuanian Army) even met personally with the Nazi Germany Generals to discuss the situation. He approached the Kaunas War Field Commandant General Oswald Pohl and the Military Command Representative General Karl von Roques by trying to plead the Jews, however they replied that the Gestapo is handling these issues and that they cannot help. Furthermore, in the beginning of the occupation, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Lithuania Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius convened the meeting in which the ministers participated together with the former President Kazys Grinius, Bishop Vincentas Brizgys and others. During the meeting, the Nazis were condemned for their actions with Jews and it was decided to help them. Although, the participants of the meeting understood that the help will be very limited, because already in the beginning of the Nazi occupation it was announced that the Jews are crossed out from the competence of Lithuanian institutions. The Germans did not recognize the new government, but also did not take any actions to dissolve it by force (unlike the government of Stepan Bandera in Ukraine). At first German military administration tolerated activities of the government as it did not attempt to take control of civilian institutions. The Reichskommissariat Ostland, German Civil Administration (Zivilverwaltung) was established on July 17.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 177 Instead of using brute force, the Civil Administration slowly removed the government's powers (for example, did not allow to print its decrees in newspapers or broadcast radio announcements) and supplanted its institutions, forcing the Provisional Government to either self-disband or to become a puppet institution. Willing to cooperate if that meant recognition and some semblance to autonomy, the government did not agree to become an instrument of German occupation. The government self-disbanded on August 5 after signing a protest for the Germans actions of suspending the Lithuanian government powers. Members of the Provisional Government then in corpore went to the Garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum, where they laid wreath near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the presence of a numerous audience. Sicherheitsdienst confiscated the pictures of the wreath-laying ceremony, thinking that it could be dangerous for the German occupation policy in Lithuania. Aftermath and controversies Funeral of the June Uprising casualties in Kaunas on June 26, 1941 Usurpation of the public life continued after the demise of the Provisional Government. The Lithuanian Activist Front was banned in September 1941 and some of its leaders transported to concentration camps. In December the last legal party of Lithuania, pro-Nazi Lithuanian Nationalist Party, was also banned. Most of the laws adopted by the Provisional Government remained paper declarations. However a couple laws that concerned items of no immediate interest of the Germans, including local administration and education, had somewhat lasting effect.Misiunas (1993), p. 48 The government left developed local administration, staffed with Lithuanians. That allowed some passive resistance when German orders from top could be blocked by the bottom. For example, Lithuanians resisted recruitment to a Waffen-SS division, quotas for forced labor in Germany, or Germanization of Lithuanian schools.Anu≈°auskas (2005), p. 192 Despite the failure to establish independence and meager long-term results, the uprising was an important event. As Kazys ≈†kirpa summarized in his memoirs, the uprising demonstrated the determination of the Lithuanian people to have their own independent state and dispelled the myth that Lithuania joined the Soviet Union voluntarily in June 1940. The uprising also contributed to unusually rapid German advances against Russia: Pskov was reached in 17 days. The events of June 1941 also caused some controversies. At the time, Lithuanian diplomats abroad, including former president Antanas Smetona and Stasys Lozoraitis, described the uprising as \\"Nazi-inspired\\". These statements might have been in an attempt to persuade United States, Great Britain, and other western powers that Lithuania was not an ally of the Nazis. Its military unit, the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas, was soon employed by the Einsatzkommando and Rollkommando Hamann in the mass executions of Lithuanian Jews in the Seventh fort of the Kaunas Fortress and in the provinces. Jewish survivors and authors accuse members of the LAF, especially in Kaunas but also in other towns, of indiscriminate and gruesome excesses against Jewish residents, often before the Nazis arrived to take control, most notably characterized by the Kaunas pogrom. In 1973, the Committee of the United States Congress made unambiguous conclusions that there is no Prime Minister Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius' guilty in the Holocaust in Lithuania. It is also known that in the summer of 1944 Ambrazeviƒçius left for Germany, and in 1948 for the United States, where he edited a Catholic daily, Darbininkas, and continued his work in the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania in exile. He published a number of leaflets illustrating German and Soviet crimes in Lithuania and the Lithuanian resistance, for example, In the Name of the Lithuanian People (1946) and Appeal to the United Nations on Genocide (1951). In 1964 he published a book Alone, all alone about the Lithuanian armed resistance. The Kremlin actively opposed his activities. In the 1970s he became a subject of interest for the Soviet media and American hunters of Nazi colloborators, who accused him of having worked for the Third Reich. In reply, he published an extensive dossier of his World War II activities. During the 2012 reburial ceremony of the Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius remains in Kaunas, adviser to Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius also noted that a 1975 investigation by US Immigration found no evidence of Brazaitis being involved in anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi activities.

Career=Singer Zetterlund began by learning the classic jazz songs from radio and records, initially not knowing the language and what they sang about in English. Her hit songs included \\"Sakta vi g√• genom stan\\" (Swedish cover of \\"Walking My Baby Back Home\\"; in Swedish a tribute to Stockholm town), \\"Visa fr√•n Utanmyra\\", \\"Sista j√§ntan\\", \\"Trubbel\\", \\"Gr√∂na sm√• √§pplen\\" (\\"Little Green Apples\\"), \\"Monicas vals\\" (\\"Waltz for Debby\\"), \\"Stick iv√§g, Jack!\\" (\\"Hit the Road Jack\\"), \\"Att ang√∂ra en brygga\\", \\"Var blev ni av\\", \\"M√•ne √∂ver Stureplan\\" (cover of Sting's \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\") and \\"Under vinrankan!\\", among many, many others. She also interpreted the works of such Swedish singer-songwriters as Evert Taube, Olle Adolphson and Povel Ramel, as well as international jazz musicians/songwriters. She worked with some of the greatest international jazz names including Louis Armstrong, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Steve Kuhn and Quincy Jones, and in the Scandinavian jazz world with people like Georg Riedel, Egil Johansen, Arne Domn√©rus, Svend Asmussen and Jan Johansson. In 1964, she recorded the critically acclaimed jazz album Waltz for Debby with Bill Evans, a record she herself described as \\"the best I've done\\" and was the most proud of. Her professional skill was amply demonstrated in this album in performing the challenging Harold Arlen song, \\"So Long, Big Time\\". Her long career also included the song \\"En g√•ng i Stockholm\\" (\\"Winter City\\"); a jazz ballad with which she represented Sweden in the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest. She finished last, however (mainly because the song genre was not suitable for the competition) and scored the infamous nul points, but remained successful in Sweden. Actor Her collaboration with the comic duo Hasse & Tage (in the 1960s and 1970s) eventually led to a stage career in revues and films. Memorable are her parts in the films Att ang√∂ra en brygga and √Ñppelkriget, with her most memorable role being in Jan Troell's Utvandrarna (aka The Emigrants; with Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow in the leads) as Ulrika, a former prostitute who together with her teenage daughter Elin (portrayed by Zetterlund's daughter, Eva Lena Zetterlund) join the main characters in their emigration to America in the 1850s, a role for which Zetterlund received a Guldbagge Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in more than 20 films and television series. Health and death She suffered from severe scoliosis which began after a childhood accident, and as a result was forced to retire from performing in 1999. On 12 May 2005, she died following an accidental fire in her apartment in Stockholm, probably due to her habit of smoking in bed. Discography= Albums  * Swedish Sensation (Columbia, 1958) * Ahh!

He served as the head basketball coach at the United States Merchant Marine Academy from 1945 to 1948, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) from 1948 to 1953, the University of Cincinnati from 1960 to 1965, and Rollins College from 1972 to 1977, compiling a career college basketball coaching record of 270‚Äì122. He led the Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball program to consecutive national titles, winning the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1961 and 1962. Jucker was also the head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team from 1954 to 1960 while serving as an assistant coach for the basketball team. He spent two seasons coaching in the professional ranks, leading the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 to 1969. Jucker served as the athletic director at Rollins College from 1981 to 1983. Biography Jucker was born in Norwood, Ohio. He attended the University of Cincinnati as an undergraduate student and played on the school's basketball teams during the 1938, 1939, and 1940 seasons. He was the captain of the 1940 team. Also, while an undergraduate, Jucker became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Jucker was a professional baseball prospect until he decided to start coaching instead of trying to make it into Major League Baseball. His coaching career began at Batavia High in Clermont County, Ohio, east of Cincinnati. Following service in the Navy during World War II, he joined the college coaching ranks as assistant basketball coach at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1946. Two years later, he became head basketball coach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Jucker returned to the University of Cincinnati in 1953 as assistant basketball coach and baseball mentor. He directed the UC freshmen to a 67‚Äì21 record in six years, while his baseball teams were 87‚Äì38 over seven seasons. In 1954, Jucker recruited Sandy Koufax at Cincinnati. After watching Koufax in his first practice, Jucker got him a work-study scholarship. Under Jucker's coaching direction in the early 60s, Cincinnati won back-to-back NCAA Basketball Tournament, in 1961 and 1962, defeating Ohio State, who had the great Jerry Lucas and Bob Knight, both years. His 1963 team reached the championship game of the NCAA tournament, where the Bearcats were upended 60‚Äì58 in overtime by Loyola of Chicago and All-American Jerry Harkness. Jucker holds the record for the highest winning percentage (.917) in NCAA tournament play. In his five seasons coaching the Bearcats, Jucker's team posted a record of 113‚Äì28, a .801 winning percentage. Jucker left coaching at UC after the 1965 season. In 1966 he remained at the university as the Intramural Director and spent the summer in Spain coaching their national team. He agreed to coach Spanish national team from 1967 but changed his mind when he received offers from the National Basketball Association (NBA).14 a√±os sin Antonio D√≠az Miguel In 1967, he became the head coach of the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association, a position he held for two seasons. Jucker then went to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida where he built the school's basketball program into a national contender in NCAA Division II.

The noun \\"amercement\\" lately derives from the verb to amerce, thus: the King amerces his subject, who offended some law. The term is of Anglo-Norman origin (Law French, from French, from Latin), and literally means \\"being at the mercy of\\": a-merce-ment (English mercy is cognate). While it is often synonymous with a fine, it differs in that a fine is a fixed sum prescribed by statute and was often voluntary, while an amercement is arbitrary. Amercements were commonly used as a punishment for minor offences (such as trespassing in the King's forest), as an alternative to imprisonment.\\"Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John, with an Historical Introduction, by William Sharp McKechnie (Glasgow: Maclehose, 1914): Chapter 20\\" History=Early Norman rule This system of amercements is found in working order as early as the Norman Conquest of 1066, but was still regarded as an innovation at the accession in 1100 of Henry I. As the number of entities having legal jurisdiction over a given location increased, the sums demanded from a wrong‚Äìdoer who wished to buy himself back under protection of the law had become increasingly burdensome. He had to satisfy claims of the victim's family, of the victim's lord, of the lord within whose territory the crime had been committed, perhaps of the church whose sanctuary had been invaded, of other lords who could show an interest of any sort, and finally of the King as lord paramount. It became practically impossible to buy back the peace once it had been broken. The Crown, however, stepped in, and offered protection on certain conditions: the culprit surrendered himself and all that he had to the King, placing himself ‚Äúin misericordiam regis,‚Äù and delivering a tangible pledge (vadium) as evidence and security of the surrender. Strictly speaking, the man's life and limbs and all that he had were at the King's mercy. The Crown, however, found that it might defeat its own interests by excessive greed; and generally contented itself with moderate forfeits. Rules of procedure were formulated: the amounts taken were regulated partly by the wealth of the offender, and partly by the gravity of the offence. Further, it became a recognized rule that the amount should be assessed by what was practically a jury of the culprit's neighbours; and attempts were also made to fix a maximum. Thus a sort of tariff grew up, which the Crown usually respected in practice, without abandoning the right to demand more. Such payments were known as ‚Äúamercements.‚Äù For petty offences, men were constantly placed ‚Äúin mercy‚Äù: for failure to attend meetings of a hundred or county; for false or mistaken verdicts; for infringements of forest rights. The Charter of Henry I. (chapter 8) had promised a remedy, drastic indeed but of a reactionary and impossible nature. His promise, to abolish altogether the system of amercements (then of recent introduction) and to revert to the earlier Anglo‚ÄìSaxon system of bots and wites, was made only to be broken. No one could expect to pass through life (perhaps hardly through a single year) without being subjected to amercements. Magna Carta Three chapters of Magna Carta are occupied with remedies for this ill. Chapter 20 seeks to protect the ordinary layman; chapter 21, the barons; and chapter 22, the clergy. Three subdivisions‚Äîthe freeman, the villein, and the merchant‚Äîare treated here. Amercements are much mentioned in Magna Carta, particularly article 20: > A free man shall not be amerced for a trivial offence except in accordance > with the degree of the offence, and for a grave offence he shall be amerced > in accordance with its gravity, yet saving his way of living; and a merchant > in the same way, saving his stock-in-trade; and a villein shall be amerced > in the same way, saving his means of livelihood--if they have fallen into > our mercy: and none of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by > the oath of good men of the neighbourhood. =Amercement of freemen= The great object of the reforms here promised was to eliminate the arbitrary element; the Crown must conform to its own customary rules. With this object, safeguards were devised for freemen. (a) For a slight offence, only a petty sum could be taken. This was nothing new: the records of John‚Äôs reign show that, both before and after 1215, very small amounts were often taken: threepence was a common sum. (b) For grave offences, a larger sum might be assessed, but not out of proportion to the offence. (c) In no case could the offender be pushed absolutely to the wall: his means of livelihood must be saved to him. Even if all other effects had to be sold off to pay the amount assessed, he was to retain his ‚Äúcontenement,‚Äù a word to be afterwards discussed. (d) Another clause provided machinery for giving effect to these rules. The amount must be fixed, not arbitrarily by the Crown, but by impartial assessors, ‚Äúby the oath of honest men of the neighbourhood.‚Äù In the reissue of 1216 ‚Äúhonest men‚Äù became ‚Äúhonest and lawworthy (legalium) men,‚Äù a purely verbal change. There were apparently two steps in the fixing of amercements. (a) In the case of a commoner, the penalty under normal circumstances would be assessed provisionally by the King's justices on circuit, with the assistance of the sheriff. It was their duty to see that the amount was proportionate to the gravity of the offence. (b) Thereafter, the sheriff or his serjeants, in full county court, with the assistance of twelve neighbours, taxed the amercements, reducing them in accordance with their knowledge of the wrong‚Äìdoer's ability to pay. The Pipe Rolls afford illustrations of the practice. In the fourteenth year of Henry II a certain priest (who, in this respect, stood on the same footing as a layman) had been placed in misericordiam of 100 marks by William fitz John, one of the King's justices, but that sum was afterwards reduced to 40 marks per sacramentum vicinorum suorum. It seems a safe inference that, on the priest pleading poverty, the question of his ability to pay was referred to local recognitors with the result stated. This priest was subsequently pardoned altogether ‚Äúbecause of his poverty.‚Äù Magna Carta in this chapter, treating of the amercements of freeholders, merchants and villeins, makes no reference to the part played by the King's justices, but only to the functions of the jury of neighbours. All this is in marked contrast with the provisions of chapter 21, regulating the treatment to be accorded to earls and barons who made default. =Amercement of villeins= The early history of villeins as a class is enveloped in the mists that still surround the rise of the English manor. Notwithstanding the efforts of Mr. Frederic Seebohm to find the origin of villeinage in the status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters upon British farms long before the Teutonic immigrations began, an older theory still holds the field, namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days were descendants of free‚Äìborn ceorls of Anglo‚ÄìSaxon stock. On this theory, most of England was once cultivated by Anglo‚ÄìSaxon peasant proprietors grouped in little societies, each of which formed an isolated village. These villagers were slowly sinking from their originally free estate during several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their degradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the Norman conquerors. The once free peasantry were crushed down into the dependent villeins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Whichever theory may be the correct one, the position, economic, legal, and political, of villeins in the thirteenth century has been ascertained with certainty. Economically they were part of the equipment of the manor of their lord, whose fields they had to cultivate as a condition of being left in possession of acres, in a sense, their own. The services exacted, at first vague and undefined, were gradually specified and limited. They varied from century to century, from district to district, and even from manor to manor; but at best the life of the villein was, as a contemporary writer has described it, burdensome and wretched (graviter et miserabiliter). After his obligations were discharged, little time was left him for the ploughing and reaping of his own holding. The normal villein possessed his virgate or half virgate (thirty or fifteen scattered acres) under a tenure known as villenagium, sharply distinguished from the freeholder's tenures. He was a dependent dweller on a manor which he dared not quit without his master's leave. It is true that he had rights of a proprietary nature in the acres he claimed as his own; yet these were determined, not by the common law of England, but by ‚Äúthe custom of the manor,‚Äù or virtually at the will of the lord. These rights, such as they were, could not be pleaded elsewhere than before the court customary of that manor over which the lord's steward presided with powers wide and undefined. Politically his position was peculiar: allowed none of the privileges, he was yet expected to perform some of the duties, of the freeman. He attended the shire and hundred courts, and acted on juries, thus suffering still further encroachments on the scanty portion of time he might call his own, but preserving for a brighter day a vague tradition of his earlier liberty. This chapter extends some measure of protection to villeins. Two questions, however, may be asked:‚ÄîWhat measure? and from what motive? One point is clear: the villeins were protected from the abuse of only such amercements as John himself might inflict, not from the amercements of their manorial lords; for the words used are si inciderint in misericordiam nostram. A villein in the King's mercy shall enjoy the same consideration as the freeholder or merchant in similar plight‚Äîhis means of livelihood being saved to him. The word now used is neither ‚Äúcontenement‚Äù nor merchandise, but waynagium, the meaning of which has been the subject of discussion. Coke defined it as ‚Äúthe contenement of a villein; or the furniture of his cart or wain,‚Äù and Coke has been widely followed. The word, however, has apparently no connexion with wains or wagons, but is merely a Latinized form of the French word gagnage, of which Godefroy gives five meanings: (a) gain; (b) tillage; (c) crop; (d) land under the plough; (e) grain. Professor Tait is inclined to read the word, in its present context, as equivalent either to ‚Äúcrops‚Äù or to ‚Äúlands under cultivation,‚Äù and to translate the clause ‚Äúsaving his tillage.‚Äù What was the motive of these restrictions? It is usually supposed to have been clemency, the humane desire not to reduce a poor wretch to absolute beggary. It is possible, however, to imagine a different motive; the villein was the property of his lord, and John must respect the vested interests of others. That the King might do what he pleased with his own property, his demesne villeins, seems clear from a passage usually neglected by commentators, namely, chapter 16 of the reissue of 1217. Four important words were there introduced‚Äîvillanus alterius quam noster: the king was not to inflict crushing amercements on villeins ‚Äúother than his own,‚Äù thus leaving villeins on royal manors unreservedly in his power. =Amercement of merchants= The trader is in the same position as the liber homo, except that it is his ‚Äúmerchandise,‚Äù not his ‚Äúcontenement,‚Äù that is protected. The word is capable of two somewhat different shades of meaning. Narrowly interpreted, it may refer to his wares, the stock‚Äìin‚Äìtrade without which the pursuit of his calling would be impossible. More broadly viewed, it might mean his business itself, his position as a merchant. The difference is of little practical import: in either view the Charter saves to him his means of earning a living. Some boroughs, indeed, had anticipated Magna Carta by obtaining in their own charters a definition of the maximum amercement exigible, or in some cases of the amercing body. Thus, John's Charter to Dunwich of 29 June 1200 provides that the burgesses shall only be amerced by six men from within the borough, and six men from without. The capital had special privileges: in his Charter to London, Henry I promised that no citizen in misericordia pecuniae should pay a higher sum than 100 shillings (the amount of his wer). This was confirmed in the Charter of Henry II, who declared ‚Äúthat none shall be adjudged for amercements of money, but according to the law of the city, which they had in the time of King Henry, my grandfather.‚Äù John's Charter to London of 17 June 1199, also referred to this; and the general confirmation of customs, contained in chapter 13 of Magna Carta, would further strengthen it. In all probability, the earlier grant covered trivial offences only (such as placed the offender in the King's hands de misericordia pecuniae). The present chapter is wider in its scope, applying to grave offences also, and embracing merchants everywhere, not merely the burgesses of chartered towns. Later Plantagenet rule Later in the thirteenth century, these terms were sharply contrasted. ‚ÄúAmercement‚Äù was applied to sums imposed in punishment of misdeeds; the law‚Äìbreaker had no option of refusing, and no voice in fixing the amount. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù on the contrary, was used for voluntary offerings made to the King to obtain some favour or to escape punishment. Here the initiative rested with the individual, who suggested the amount to be paid, and was, indeed, under no legal obligation to make any offer at all. This distinction between fines and amercements, absolute in theory, could readily be obliterated in practice. The spirit of the restriction placed by this chapter and by the common law upon the King's prerogative of inflicting amercements could often be evaded. The Crown might imprison its victims for an indefinite period, and then graciously allow them to offer large payments to escape death by fever or starvation in a noisome gaol: enormous fines might thus be taken, while royal officials were forbidden to inflict arbitrary amercements. With the gradual elimination of the voluntary element the word ‚Äúfine‚Äù came to bear its modern meaning, while ‚Äúamercement‚Äù dropped out of ordinary use. Modern usage=In the United States Referred to in Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987). In a discussion about the imposition of FRCP Rule 11 sanctions on a plaintiff's attorney, the decision says, \\"The complaint in this case was frivolous, which calls at a minimum for censure of Victor D. Quilici, the plaintiffs' lawyer. Whether it calls for amercement - and, if so, whether Cotter or the Treasury is the appropriate beneficiary - is something the district court should consider as an initial matter.\\"Frantz v.

Reichert (2014) Terrance Huff was driving and Jon Seaton was the passenger in a car with Ohio license plates that was stopped in Illinois, as recorded by Officer Reichert's dashboard camera. Huff provided his driver's license, insurance, and registration. Reichert explained that Huff crossed the center line without using a signal and then moved back into his own lane. Dispatch related that Huff had been arrested for battery and for marijuana cultivation in 2001, but those charges were dismissed. Seaton had no criminal history. Reichert requested backup, but told Huff that he was letting him go with a warning. Seaton seemed nervous, so Reichert then asked if Huff objected to a search. Huff replied that he would ‚Äúlike to go.‚Äù Reichert said that he wanted to walk his drug‚Äêsniffing dog around the car. Huff asked Reichert if he was free to go. Reichert responded, ‚Äúnot in the car.‚Äù Huff said that he felt he had no choice but to consent, and that Reichert could use the dog but could not search the car. Reichert repeatedly said, ‚Äúshow me! Find it!‚Äù The dog barked. Reichert replied, repeatedly, ‚Äúgood boy!‚Äù Reichert later admitted that he was trained not to say these things to his dog. Reichert told Huff that he was going to search his car. Huff responded, ‚Äúdo what you gotta do.‚Äù Reichert searched the car, but did not document the presence of drugs nor collect any evidence. About 50 minutes after the stop, Reichert told the two men that they were free to leave. In their suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983, the court denied Reichert's motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.law.justitia.com: \\"Huff v Reichert\\" The incident occurred along a stretch of highway know to be a lucrative source of asset forfeiture revenue for state and local police departments.

A recent addition to the state's crime control toolbox, the development of civil forfeiture in Ireland and in Canada, shows remarkable resistance to the idea that standard criminal justice safeguards govern the forfeiture process. The stark parallels in these two jurisdictions demonstrate tacit acceptance of a strategy that proves perilous to long-held procedural and substantive rights. By deftly shifting to formally civil instruments, Ireland and Canada have organized an assault on crime that circumvents the conventional criminal law, arguably seriously abrogating rights and procedural justice.

Singing critics like Melanie Eskenazi describe him as a vocal virtuoso of the local phrasing and decoration (ornamenti) of those particular musical periods exactly as they were practised back then. He is considered a world authority in the field of European early music, the scores of which he helped promote and rescue as a music genre, since the outset of his early career. Early life A native of Wellington, Shropshire, Nigel was brought up in a musical family where his father sang in a choir and his mother taught the piano, so from a very early age he was studying music. Nigel Rogers studied at King's College, Cambridge (where he was a choral scholar) from 1953 to 1956, in Rome in 1957, in Milan from 1958 to 1959, and with Gerhard H√ºsch at the Munich Hochschule f√ºr Musik (1959‚Äì1961). Whilst in Munich, along with Thomas Binkley, Sterling Jones and Andrea von Ramm, he was a founder member of the pioneering medieval ensemble, Studio der Fr√ºhen Musik (Early Music Quartet) with which he worked for around three years, leaving the group in December 1963. He made 11 recordings with them between 1962 and 1970, including the award winning album of John Dowland on the Archiv label released in 1966. Opera career He made his operatic debut in Amsterdam, and has sung in many renowned international opera houses. He has given numerous singing master classes and workshops at music conservatories worldwide, for early music and opera singers of all nationalities. Operas with which he was notably associated include L'Orfeo by Monteverdi, in which he took the title role and made many recordings. From 1978 until his retirement he was a professor of classical singing and operatic voice coach at the Royal College of Music in London. In 1979 he founded and thereupon conducted the vocal ensemble Chiaroscuro for the performance of Italian baroque compositions. In July 1993 he starred at a Handel oratorio at the Palacio de Bellas Artes Opera House in Mexico City. In May 1994, two great-great grandchildren of President of Mexico Valent√≠n Canalizo, Antonio Haas Canalizo, patron of the Mazatl√°n Opera House \\"Teatro √Ångela Peralta\\", classical and jazz pianist, and founder of the Mazatl√°n Conservatory of Music and the Mazatl√°n Literature Award in Sinaloa state, Mexico, and his niece, soprano, jazz singer, castanets soloist, singer-songwriter and member of royalty, Lady Marina De Santiago-de Borb√≥n Haas Canalizo (Lady Marina of Bourbon), Queen of Spain Isabella II of Bourbon's great-great granddaughter, invited Nigel Rogers to the city of Mazatl√°n. There he was acquainted with different styles of Mexican music, Mariachi, and Mexican Carnival band music. Nigel became a close long-standing friend of Lady Marina of Bourbon, and the Haas Canalizo family, founders and former inhabitants of today's \\"Haas House Museum\\" (Casa Museo Haas) in Mazatl√°n, the family's mansion where Nigel stayed during his visit to Mazatl√°n before it was turned into a museum by the government of Sinaloa.

It was first developed in the early 1700s in China, where the trait was referred to as dragon eyes. Description Ranchu with telescope eyes, 1910. Except for its enlarged projecting eyes, the demekin is similar to the ryukin and fantail. It has a deep body and long flowing fins, some with veiled fins and some with broad, or short fins, like the \\"China doll\\". Demekins are available in red, red-and-white, calico, black-and-white, chocolate, blue, lavender, kirin, chocolate-and-blue and black coloration. They may either have metallic, matted, or nacreous scales. Telescope eyes can grow quite large. Variants=Black Telescope The highest quality black moors have a velvety appearance and no metallic scales. The black telescope is a black colored variant of a telescope goldfish that has a characteristic pair of protruding eyes. Black telescopes are commonly known as Blackamoors, black moors or just moors, a reference to the black North African Muslim inhabitants of Al- Andalus. Black telescopes are descendants of a type of wild carp known as the silver Prussian carp or gibel carp, this fish is believed to originate from China in the 1400s. In the 1500s they were traded in Japan, and lastly, in the 1800s, they made their way to the U.S.. It is widely accepted they were a result of selective fish breeding by Chinese who first called them Dragon Fish or Dragon Eyes. A partially gold black telescope Most telescopes have deep bodies and long, flowing finnage, with characteristic protruding eyes, but the original is fan-tailed and has a similar body to the fantail goldfish, from which they are derived. Young black telescopes resemble bronze fantails. Their black coloration and eye protrusion develop with age. They can grow up to a length of 4-10 inches, but may lose their velvet-like appearance with increasing age (lifespan: 6 to 25 years). The fish can range in coloring anywhere from a lighter grey to a dark black, but most black telescope goldfish do not stay pure black forever, and many of them change from a rust- colored underbelly to orange splotches. Because their eyes are usually large, their vision is poor. Black telescope goldfish are popular because they are hardy fish and because their black color sets them apart from the more abundant orange color. Goldfish are typically easy to care for. Black moors, in particular, are able to withstand a wide variety of temperatures. They do well with other fancy goldfish varieties, especially those with impaired vision such as the bubble eye or Celestial goldfish. It was once theorized that the blackness in goldfish is only exhibited by the telescope-eyed goldfish and that the black color is only a permanent fixture with telescope eye goldfish. However, with the recent entry of black lionheads, black orandas, black ranchus, black ryukins, black pearlscales, black comets, black bubble eyes, black crosses of two or more goldfish, and black \\"hibunas\\", this view is no longer true. In fact, black telescopes do sometimes spawn normal- eyed offspring, which are black also. However, they are often culled as they do not conform to the telescope eye feature for the Moor variety. In 1941, Moscow aquarist P. Andrianov, bred a kind of black telescope with orange-red eyes. Panda Telescope Juvenile panda moor goldfish The panda telescope is a panda variant of a telescope goldfish with a characteristic black-and- white color pattern and protruding eyes. Panda telescopes have protruding eyes. Young moors resemble bronze fantails and their protruding eyes gradually develop with age. They sport a velvety appearance in maturity. However, they may lose this velvet-like appearance with increasing age. They can also lose their panda coloration with age; they may become orange and white or any other color combination. Frequently panda moors will not keep any of their coloration, or they may turn pure white. White Telescope A white telescope goldfish White telescope is a white variant of telescope goldfish characterized by a solid white body and protruding eyes. The white telescope has a solid white body which contrasts the black variant, the black telescope goldfish, which has a solid black body. The white moor is a variant of the telescope goldfish. Young white telescopes resemble bronze fantails. Their brown coloration decreases and eye protrusion develops with age. They can grow up to a length of 6 inches. Because their eyes are usually large, their vision is poor. White telescopes are less popular than black telescopes. The white telescopes, in particular, are able to withstand a wide variety of temperatures. They do well with other fancy goldfish varieties. Other variants Common variations of the telescope eye There are also red, orange and yellow telescopes.

The months leading up to it saw hasty but major improvements in the defense of the castle, as Hideyoshi's intentions became clear. Thus, despite the overwhelming force brought to bear by Hideyoshi, the siege saw little actual fighting. The massive army of Toyotomi Hideyoshi surrounded the castle in what has been called \\"the most unconventional siege lines in samurai history.\\" The samurai were entertained by everything from concubines, prostitutes, and musicians to acrobats, fire-eaters, and jugglers. The defenders slept on the ramparts with their arquebuses and armor; despite their smaller numbers, they discouraged Hideyoshi from attacking. So, for the most part, this siege consisted of traditional starvation tactics. Only a few small skirmishes erupted around the castle, as when a group of miners from Kai Province dug under the castle walls, allowing men under Ii Naomasa to enter. After three months, the H≈çj≈ç surrendered by losing the will to fight by the sudden appearance of Ishigakiyama Ichiya Castle. Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of Hideyoshi's top generals, was given the H≈çj≈ç lands. Though Hideyoshi could not have guessed it at the time, this would turn out to be a great stepping-stone towards Tokugawa's attempts at conquest and the office of Sh≈çgun. In addition to taking Odawara Castle, Hideyoshi also defeated the H≈çj≈ç at their outposts at Hachi≈çji Castle, Hachigata Castle, and Shizuoka in and near the southwestern part of the Kant≈ç region. The Chiba, allies of the H≈çj≈ç in Shim≈çsa, also saw Sakura Castle fall to Honda Tadakatsu and Sakai Ietsugu of the Tokugawa army during the campaign. Chiba Shigetane, daimy≈ç of the Chiba, surrendered the castle to the besieging forces on the condition that his clan would not be abolished. While the Chiba were consequently divested of all of their holdings, many of their senior members were taken into service by Tokugawa retainer Ii Naomasa, thanks to aid he had received many years earlier from the clan during the occupation of Takeda Katsuyori's Tsutsujigasaki Castle.Chiba-ki, Takayama Kiyotaka The tea master Yamanoue S≈çji was at the service of the Odawara lords. He was sentenced to death in a torturous way. In popular culture The Siege of Odawara is the climax of Hideyoshi's story in the video game Samurai Warriors 2. Due to the sheer size of Odawara Castle in the game, it is divided into two stages, the eastern side besieged by the Tokugawa, Ch≈çsokabe (in Xtreme Legends only), Shimazu, and Date armies, and the western side besieged by the Toyotomi main army. In the Sengoku Basara Season 2 anime, Odawara Castle was the setting for the fight between Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Date Masamune. Hideyoshi was killed in the castle at Masamune's hands. Afterward, Ishida Mitsunari went to the castle to grieve his master's demise. References *Sansom, George (1961). A History of Japan: 1334‚Äì1615.

Written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, it was first broadcast on BBC1 in 1993. It comprised four episodes, each 45 minutes long, and was broadcast only once, apart from the first episode, which was repeated on BBC Four on 3 December 2007 as part of \\"David Renwick Night\\". The title is a reference to 'if you see Sid, tell him', the slogan used for the sale of shares in British Gas plc.  Plot  The series is set in London and follows the character of Godfrey Spry, played by Briers. As he is standing outside the post office, a wheelbarrow full of building rubble falls on top of him, causing serious physical injuries (from which he recovers) and leaving him with a greatly reduced attention span. As a result, he spends most of his time watching television commercials, and believes every claim made by them. After seeing an advertisement for a car, he proceeds to copy it by test-driving the same car at high speed along the top of a cliff at sunset, the resulting accident leaving him paralysed. He convinces his wife to take a relaxing break with him in Hamburg, which he describes to the viewer in idyllic terms, before casually mentioning that on the last night his wife 'popped out [of the hotel] for a packet of cough sweets and was stoned to death by a mob of drunken soccer fans'. This entire back-story is played out very early in episode one, with the main part of the series starting with Godfrey calling his nephew Gordon for help after his wife's death. Every episode was punctuated by deadpan parody advertisements for fictional products and companies, often juxtaposing the idealistic view of the adverts with the far bleaker reality. Much of the humour of the show derived from Godfrey's cheery interpretations of unpleasant events and circumstances. One memorable scene involves him cheerfully passing a group of people outside his neighbour's flat, blissfully unaware that he has driven the man to suicide, attributing the man's disappearance to him moving up the property ladder. In a later episode, Godfrey befriends a young school-boy after offering to purchase for him some age-restricted craft material. Godfrey however has a very bad influence on the boy and his school friends, as they become a gang of shoplifters who become news media with an unidentified elderly man as the suspected ring-leader. Eventually the children are apprehended by the police, and an elderly member of the black community - who is also paraplegic - is mistaken for Godfrey and arrested; mass riots result in protest. In the last episode, after seeing government advertisements promoting free-enterprise, Godfrey sets up his own business in Gordon and Muriel's house, hiring an elderly lady he met in hospital to knit tea-cosies in the shed. When she falls dead of a heart attack, Godfrey attempts to perform a post mortem, which he believes himself to be an expert in after purchasing a partwork of Complete Medical Knowledge. As a result, he is arrested for murder. At the trial, Gordon makes an impassioned plea, claiming that it is not Godfrey who should be on trial, but the advertisers who are murdering all of our minds. Godfrey is convicted and sent to a hospital for the criminally insane; languishing in his cell, he is happy under the illusion that he is the centre of attention at a dinner party, where fancy chocolates are being served.

Biography=In the French Army Cluseret was born on 13 June 1823 in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine. In 1841 he entered the Saint-Cyr military academy, and was commissioned in the French Army in 1843. He was made captain of the 23rd Mobile Guard battalion following the February revolution of 1848, and participated in the suppression of the June Days Uprising which was to later earn him hostility in certain socialist quarters. His support for an anti-Bonapartist demonstration on 29 January 1849 saw him demoted from command of his battalion, and he fled to London after Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte's December 1851 coup. He was reinstated as a lieutenant in early 1853 and took part in several expeditions to Algeria. He served in the Crimean War, and was wounded during the siege of Sebastopol. It was at this time that he acquired the nickname of \\"Captain Tin Can\\", derived from his hoarding of canned meat and bread rations at the expense of his troops. He resigned from the army in July 1858. With Garibaldi's Volunteers After brief spells in Northern Algeria and New York City he travelled to Naples in 1860 and participated in the foundation of the De Flotte Legion, a French Corps to assist in the fight for Italian unification, of which he was soon given command. The legion was subsequently disbanded into the Piedmontese army and Cluseret lost his colonelship. In the American Civil War In 1861 Cluseret returned to America to 'participate in the triumph of freedom'. He served under Fremont and McClellan, and actively lobbied to secure his promotion to the rank of brigadier general, but resigned in March 1863.National Archives, RG 94, Entry 297, Records of Divisions of the Adjutant General‚Äôs Office, Appointment, Commission and Personal Branch, 1783-1917, Letters Received, 1863-1894 Following his resignation he co-founded the New York City-based newspaper New Nation with Fremont, which adopted a radical Republican perspective, criticising Lincoln's gradualist approach to the issue of slavery. After an acrimonious dispute between the two leading to a lawsuit, Cluseret had to pay Fremont a ¬£1,148 fine, although he remained proprietor of the New Nation for a further year. The Fenian Brotherhood and Reform League In 1866, the governor of New York, Reuben Fenton, entrusted Cluseret with a mission to organise the Fenian Brotherhood as part of a diversionary plan to undermine British influence in the Mediterranean. He participated in the Fenian insurrection (1866‚Äì67), escaping arrest on the collapse of the movement, but was condemned to death in his absence. He fled Ireland and arrived in London just after the Reform League's Hyde Park demonstration in 1867. He met a dozen members of the Reform League, including John Bedford Leno, in a private room of the \\"White Horse\\" in Rathbone Place. He proposed that they create civil war in England and offered the service of two thousand sworn members of the Fenian body, and that he would act as their leader. John Bedford Leno was the first to reply and denounced the proposal, stating that it would surely lead to their \\"discomfiture and transportation\\", and added that the government would surely hear of the plot. During subsequent speeches Leno noticed that only a matchboard partition divided the room they occupied with another adjoining room, and that voices could be heard the other side. Leno declared his intention to leave at once; the others agreed and the room was soon cleared. The next day the meeting was fully reported in The Times, although Leno's speech had been attributed to George Odgers, who had in fact been the only person to support Cluserat's proposal. John Bedford Leno was fully satisfied with the success the Reform League had met and, being opposed to unnecessary violence, bitterly opposed the interference of Cluseret, as did most of the other members of the Reform League. Cluseret's \\"call to arms\\" was rejected and he left England for Paris. Paris Commune He soon incurred the wrath of the French authorities, serving two months at Sainte-P√©lagie Prison for an antimilitarist article published in his newly founded newspaper L'Art. At this time he met several members of the International Workingmen's Association. Although he claimed to have had an interest in socialist ideas since 1848, it appears he did not join the International Workingmen's Association until his detainment, although he later claimed to have been a member since 1865. He made a brief return to America to avoid further imprisonment, arriving back in France upon the proclamation of the Third Republic in 1870. After his initial attempts to obtain a commission in the French army were refused he set to work to organize the social revolution, first at Lyon and afterwards at Marseilles. Mikhail Bakunin placed much of the blame for the failure of the Lyon Commune revolution on Cluseret's refusal to arm the local volunteers. On the news of the Communard rising of 18 March 1871 he hastened to Paris, where he was appointed Delegate of War by the Commune's Executive Commission. He quickly set about reorganising the National Guard, but his attempts to introduce a centralised militarism led to friction with the federalist Central Committee who withdrew their willing co-operation, and routinely censored his proclamations. On April 16 he was elected a member of the commune, and subsequently reelected its Delegate of War. Disagreements with the other leaders of the Commune led to his arrest on the May 1, on a false charge of betraying the cause. On May 21 he appeared before an ad hoc court and was acquitted. During the occupation of Paris by the Versailles troops he hid at a priest's house, and in November left the city disguised as a priest and crossed into Belgium and from there onto Switzerland where he stayed until 1877. Cluseret published his M√©moires (of the Commune) at Paris in 1887‚Äì88. After the Commune Following the suppression of the Commune many Communards fled to Geneva. This allowed Cluseret to remain politically active although he was dogged with allegations of being a Prussian spy. His apparently comfortable living conditions were interpreted as a give-away. His time in Geneva was however largely uneventful and with new adventure in mind he departed for the Ottoman Empire in late September 1877 intent on recruiting volunteers to found a republic in Turkey. After several months travelling through the Balkans Cluseret made it to Constantinople, but little is known of his involvement in the Russo-Turkish war. He made a brief return to France in 1880 following the amnesty offered to Communards, but again had to flee, this time for penning an article critical of General Ernest Courtot de Cissey. He returned to Constantinople where he stayed until 1886, making a living as an artist and porcelain maker, and providing the US government with a report on Turkish cotton. After his return to France he settled in Hy√®res, a town near Toulon. In 1888, 1889, 1893 and 1898 he was returned to the Chamber of Deputies as a socialist by the electorate of Toulon, but forfeiting his alliance with the Guesdists in 1889. This commenced his steady drift away from socialism, leaving the International Workingmen's Association in 1893, and siding with the anti-Dreyfusards during the Dreyfus Affair. From this point on he consistently emphasised nationalist, over socialist perspectives, and regularly engaged in increasingly anti-Semitic diatribes. Cluseret died on August 22, 1900.

Since 1649, the term \\"rump parliament\\" has been used to refer to any parliament left over after the true parliament has formally dissolved. In the United States in the 19th century, upon the secession of Virginia from the union on April 27, 1861, anti-secessionist legislators convened a rump legislature and formed a pro-Union reformed government which claimed to represent all of Virginia. This reformed government authorized the creation of the state of Kanawha, later renamed West Virginia. By contrast, the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan between 1951 and 1991, having been relocated from Nanking to Taipei when the Republic of China lost its Chinese mainland in late 1949, contained members originally elected from mainland constituencies who could not be replaced. The pre-reform Legislative Yuan was nevertheless widely regarded as a rump legislature, controlling only a fraction of the territory it claimed to represent. Irish republican legitimists regarded the Second D√°il elected in 1921 as the last legitimate Irish legislature, arguing it never formally yielded its authority to the Third D√°il elected in June 1922.

They are known for nitrogen-fixing abilities, and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants, such as the mosquito fern. They are one of four genera of cyanobacteria that produce neurotoxins, which are harmful to local wildlife, as well as farm animals and pets. Production of these neurotoxins is assumed to be an input into its symbiotic relationships, protecting the plant from grazing pressure. A DNA sequencing project was undertaken in 1999, which mapped the complete genome of Anabaena, which is 7.2 million base pairs long. The study focused on heterocysts, which convert nitrogen into ammonia. Certain species of Anabaena have been used on rice paddy fields, proving to be an effective natural fertilizer. Nitrogen fixation by Anabaena Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts at semiregular intervals along the filaments. Heterocyst cells are terminally specialized for nitrogen fixation. The interior of these cells is micro-oxic as a result of increased respiration, inactivation of O2-producing photosystem (PS) II, and formation of a thickened envelope outside of the cell wall. Nitrogenase, sequestered within these cells, transforms dinitrogen into ammonium at the expense of ATP and reductant‚Äîboth generated by carbohydrate metabolism, a process supplemented, in the light, by the activity of PS I. Carbohydrate, probably in the form of glucose, is synthesized in vegetative cells and moves into heterocysts. In return, nitrogen fixed in heterocysts moves into the vegetative cells, at least in part in the form of amino acids. The fern Azolla, forms a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, giving the plant access to the essential nutrient. This has led to the plant being dubbed a \\"super-plant\\", as it can readily colonise areas of freshwater, and grow at great speed - doubling its biomass in as little as 1.9 days. The typical limiting factor on its growth is phosphorus, abundance of which, due to chemical runoff, often leads to Azolla blooms. Unlike other known plants, the symbiotic microorganism is transferred directly from one generation to the next. This has made Anabaena azollae completely dependent on its host, as several of its genes are either lost or has been transferred to the nucleus in Azolla‚Äôs cells.The Arctic Azolla event - The Geological Society Primitive vision pigments studied in Anabaena Anabaena is used as a model organism to study simple vision. The process in which light changes the shape of molecules in the retina, thereby driving the cellular reactions and signals that cause vision in vertebrates, is studied in Anabaena. Anabaena sensory rhodopsin, a specific light-sensitive membrane protein, is central to this research.

This was followed by their debut album The Journey in March 1997, which was certified Gold by the BPI in November 1997. 911 released two more Silver- certified albums, Moving On, which featured the talents of guitarist Nick Cash (real name Keith Lucas) and There It Is, in 1998 and 1999, respectively. There It Is also produced their only UK number-one single, a cover of \\"A Little Bit More\\", which topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1999. In their five years together, 911 scored ten UK top 10 singles. They sold 10 million singles and 6 million albums around the world, and were very popular in South East Asia, where their first two albums went to number one. They announced their split in February 2000. In October 2012, it was announced that 911 would again reunite for the ITV2 reality-documentary series The Big Reunion, along with Atomic Kitten, Liberty X, B*Witched, Five and Honeyz in January 2013. Due to the highly positive reception, the groups went on an arena tour around the UK and Ireland. Their comeback album Illuminate... (The Hits and More) was released on 8 September 2013, along with their comeback single \\"2 Hearts 1 Love\\". In early 2014, 911 headlined their own UK tour - The Illuminate: The Hits and More Tour. Career=1995‚Äì1996: Formation Dancers Jimmy Constable and Simon \\"Spike\\" Dawbarn were introduced to each other in the early 1990s by another dancer called Clive. Before long, Constable and Dawbarn were both chosen to work as dancers on the late-night ITV music show The Hit Man and Her. In 1995, after seeing how successful Jason Orange, who used to be a dancer on the show, had been with boy band Take That (and having also become more popular than the acts they were dancing for), Constable and Dawbarn decided to put their own group together. At Carlisle's radio station CFM Radio, they found Steve Gilmour, who had previously managed PJ & Duncan and Boyzone, and asked him to be their manager a few months later. Gilmour initially turned them down as he did not know anything about management, but as time went on, Constable and Dawbarn continued to gain more and more fans. Every time their paths crossed, Constable would show Gilmour the fanmail they were receiving and they were also one of the seven acts to be booked at the Sands Centre in Carlisle, again for CFM. Gilmour had finally become convinced and he decided to manage them but they were short of a singer. Lee Brennan, who had been a fan of Dawbarn and Constable on The Hit Man and Her, was recruited following recommendation by Gilmour. After moving into Gilmour's three-bedroom flat in the south side of Glasgow, 911 embarked on a massive tour of schools and under-18 clubs all over the UK in order to build up their growing army of teenage followers, and fast became crowd favourites on road shows during the Summer of 1995. Despite their immense popularity, they were turned down by every record company they turned to. 1996‚Äì2000: Success In April 1996, after being unable to secure a major record deal, 911 and their management team Backlash decided to form their own record label, Ginga Records. The following month, they released their debut single, a cover of Shalamar's \\"Night to Remember\\", and it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 38. In July, their second single \\"Love Sensation\\", which was later featured in the 1997 live-action film Casper: A Spirited Beginning, charted even higher at number 21. The success of these two independently released singles created a major record label bidding war and in September 1996, 911 were signed up by Richard Branson's Virgin Records on a ¬£3.5 million, four-album deal. 911 won GMTV's 'Search for the Next Big Thing' and were voted the 'Second Best Newcomer' after the Spice Girls in Smash Hits. 911 had their first top 10 hit in 1996 with \\"Don't Make Me Wait\\", which reached number 10. Nine more successive UK top 10 hits followed, including \\"Bodyshakin'\\" (which became their signature song); \\"Private Number\\" and the UK chart-topper \\"A Little Bit More\\". During this time, 911 released three studio albums, The Journey (1997), Moving On (1998), There It Is (1999), all of which hit the top 20 on the UK Albums Chart. They also sold out 35 theatre dates in just 30 minutes for their first headline tour. In Malaysia, The Journey was number one for 20 weeks and every one of their singles was number one as well. However, after a gruelling schedule the band began to fall apart, with Constable descending into alcoholism (on one occasion appearing on SMTV Live drunk), Dawbarn beginning to suffer agoraphobia and Brennan, being the pin-up and lead singer of the band, began to feel more and more insecure about his image and looks. At the end of 1999, 911 released a greatest hits album, The Greatest Hits and a Little Bit More, which included (at the time) their final single \\"Wonderland\\". In February 2000, Dawbarn and Brennan told Constable that they wanted to split up. On The Big Reunion, Dawbarn said: \\"We knew we'd reached our peak and we were kind of that little decline and we thought, 'It's best getting out at the top.'\\"ITV Television, The Big Reunion. 911 interviewed, March 2013 Constable was also told by the other two that he would be the one to break the news of their break-up live on Chris Moyles' Radio 1 show. In a 2005 interview with The Guardian, Constable: \\"I didn't have any time to get my head around it. I had a lump in my throat saying it, then we came out of Radio 1 and the other two guys went to the pub. I got in my car and took off and I never saw them for two years.\\" 2008: First reunion In 2008, 911 reformed to a nightclub tour of the UK and Republic of Ireland, performing their most popular hits, and have also performed at a number of nightclub and university events, and they entertained the crowd prior to the Bradford Bulls clash with Leeds Rhinos on 23 May 2008. They took part in Living's Pop Goes the Band; where they came together to get back to their boy band ways, resulting in a live performance of \\"Bodyshakin'\\". 2012: Second reunion 911 reunited in 2012, along with Atomic Kitten, Liberty X, B*Witched, Five and Honeyz, for the ITV2 documentary series The Big Reunion, a show which would feature the bands reuniting for the first time in several years and undergoing two weeks of intense rehearsals ahead of a comeback performance some time in 2013. The show began airing on 31 January 2013, and the second episode, which aired on 7 February, featured Lee, Jimmy and Spike talking about their time together and the difficulties that came with being in a band. The six bands performed a sold-out comeback concert at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013. However, following the high demand for tickets for the gig and The Big Reunion pulling in record ratings for ITV2, it was announced that a UK arena tour would be taking place from 3‚Äì14 May 2013. Two more dates were later added for 16 and 17 May, taking the tour total to 14 shows. Due to the arena tour quickly selling out as well, it was announced that the bands from the show will also be going on a mini- Christmas party tour in December 2013. On 6 March, 911 made an appearance on Daybreak, where they announced that they had recorded a more up-to-date version of \\"Bodyshakin'\\" and were also planning to release new material. On 28 March, they appeared on This Morning and confirmed that they would definitely be releasing a new album and touring in 2014. Brennan said: \\"We're doing a new album, we're going to be touring ourselves next year, so we've got lots of things to look forward to. Bring It On!\\". During The Big Reunion arena tour, it was announced that the band's new album would be called Illuminate. On 3 August, Brennan tweeted that the album, Illuminate... (The Hits and More), would be released on 9 September 2013 alongside their comeback single \\"2 Hearts 1 Love\\". During another appearance on This Morning on 5 August, 911 spoke about their music comeback and also performed \\"2 Hearts 1 Love\\". On 20 March 2014, it was announced that 911 and the other boy bands from both the first and second series of The Big Reunion, Five, Blue, 3T, A1, Damage and 5th Story, would go on a nationwide tour in October 2014.  2019: 911 The Reunion  On 22 June 2019, 911 made a comeback to South East Asia with their concert known as 911 The Reunion at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with a SOLD OUT show.

He specialised in, and was a pioneer of, environmental economics, having published over fifty books and over 300 academic articles on the subject, including his 'Blueprint for a Green Economy' series. Background David Pearce was born in Harrow, London on 11 October 1941, and attended Harrow Weald county grammar school, now part of Harrow College. He graduated in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics from Lincoln College, Oxford in 1963 (1st class) and then studied economics at London School of Economics from 1963 to 1964. He held academic posts at the Universities of Lancaster, Southampton, Leicester (from 1974-1979), and Aberdeen (Chair in political economy until 1983) before arriving at UCL as Professor of Political Economy and later in Economics in 1983, retiring in 2004. During his career he was the chief environmental adviser to the UK Secretaries of State between 1989 and 1992‚ÄîChristopher Patten and Michael Heseltine. He also provided advice to a number of major companies. He was a convening lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He was co-director of the environmental economics research centre, CSERGE (Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment), from 1991 to 2001. Pearce also established the internationally renowned MSc in Environmental and Resource Economics at UCL. He was an inspirational teacher held in the highest esteem by the many graduates of this degree, most of whom are now working in environmental policy making and research throughout the world. Pearce married Sue in 1966 and had two sons, Daniel and Corin. He lived latterly in Saffron Walden, Essex. Scholarship Pearce is best known for setting out economic valuation techniques for natural phenomena, arguing that the environment is \\"under-priced\\" and that environmental services may be calculated. If they are, their true worth is more likely to be recognised. His early work was on cost- benefit analysis and the economics of pollution and natural resource depletion, before these ideas entered the mainstream of the economic sciences and policymaking. Blueprint for Green Economy was published in 1989 (with Anil Markandya and Ed Barbier), and was a bestselling work with strong influence on governments in Britain and beyond. It advocated basing policy on the criterion of \\"sustainability\\", valuing environmental effects, and making use of market incentives. Market-based policies such as pollution taxes, tradable permits and conservation payments have some of their origins in Pearce's work‚Äîfor example, Britain's landfill tax, the EU's emissions trading scheme and the various mechanisms for international pollution offsets in the Kyoto Protocol. For Pearce, sustainability involved each generation passing on at least as much capital as it inherited. Environmental capital describes the stock and the state of natural resources. Economic damage was inevitable but could be controlled through realistic valuation in the market; the price of precious resources, or penalties for damaging them, should be set high (e.g. for noise, waste, global warming, risks to life and health, species conservation and biodiversity). Without this, future generations would suffer. His love for nature and his care for the environment resonate through his work. At the same time, he was fiercely critical of environmental alarmism and sloppy environmental policy.D.W. Pearce (2006), Energy Economics, 28: 149-158. The \\"valuation\\" of natural phenomena was widely debated and challenged, sometimes by critics who saw Pearce as a supporter of market-based, neoliberal economic policy. Pearce was commissioned by the Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel to write a report about the construction industry Pearce, D.

It was organized in 1905, established in 1906, and incorporated by the Government of Ontario in 1924 via an Act in the Ontario Legislature, which split the Agricultural and Horticultural Societies into the Ontario Agricultural Fairs Association and the OHA. Its founding motto was \\"Keeping Ontario Beautiful\\". Membership to the Ontario Horticultural Association is granted to those horticultural societies that satisfy the requirements of the Ontario Horticultural Societies Act. Each local society may become an affiliate member of the OHA upon remittance of an affiliation fee, and each receives an annual grant based on paid memberships. The OHA consists of 19 districts comprising autonomous local societies in its region. Its executive council has representatives from each district. Each member society defines guidelines for beautification of its community, including planning, development and maintenance of urban parks. Each local society is also responsible for fundraising, organizing conservation programs, and operating youth programs, and sets its own membership fee. Purpose At inception, the organization was established to promote horticultural practices in the province, with a specific focus on ornamental plants. It did so by organizing shows, staging competitions, and hosting courses to \\"interest juniors and others in the study of horticulture\\". Today, it is focused on food gardening, for example by promoting the installation of bee nesting boxes by local societies. The organization presents nine awards at its annual convention, some of which have been awarded since the organization's establishment. Its most prestigious award is the Silver Medal Award. The Silver Fir Award is given to an individual who demonstrates \\"outstanding service\\" to the horticultural society in Ontario to which that individual belongs. Others are the Trillium Award, Award of Merit, Community Improvement Award, Environmental Award, Youth Leader Award, and the Honour Roll. Grants are provided to societies by the OHA for various activities, such as establishing a seed exchange program. At the 2014 Fall Convention, it established GardenOntario Week, an annual program organizing horticultural events and activities throughout the province.

During his 25-year coaching career at UGA, Dooley compiled a 201‚Äì77‚Äì10 record. His teams won six Southeastern Conference titles and the 1980 national championship. After the 1980 season, Dooley was recognized as college football's \\"Coach of the Year\\" by several organizations, including the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, whose annual award has since been renamed as the Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award. Dooley's teams were known for their hard nosed defense and conservative yet fundamentally sound offenses. From 1964 to 1980, Dooley was assisted by his defensive coordinator, Erskine \\"Erk\\" Russell. Early life and education Dooley grew up in Mobile, Alabama and attended the McGill Institute, administered by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. Dooley competed on behalf of McGill's athletic teams, known as the Yellow Jackets, and for a few years considered basketball to be his best sport. Dooley is a graduate of Auburn University (bachelor's degree 1954, Master's in history 1963) where he played college football and later coached under Ralph \\"Shug\\" Jordan. Dooley was a member of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity as an undergraduate at Auburn. He served as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps. Coaching career After spending the first ten years of his adult life at Auburn, Dooley was hired as head coach at Georgia. In his 25 seasons, he averaged over eight wins a year, won six Southeastern Conference championships (1966, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1982) and one National Championship in 1980. After the 1980 national championship season, Vince Dooley was offered the head coaching position at Auburn, encouraged by his former Auburn teammate and Alabama Governor Fob James. However, Dooley eventually declined the job, which went to Georgia alumnus Pat Dye. In his first three seasons at Georgia, Vince Dooley went 3‚Äì0 versus Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd. Ironically, Dooley was influenced by Dodd's style and approach to the game, and he was the first recipient of the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. At the time of his retirement, he was the second-winningest coach in SEC history, behind only Bear Bryant. Family Bill Dooley, Vince's younger brother, worked on the Georgia Bulldogs football staff before becoming a notable college Head Coach in his own right at the University of North Carolina (from 1967 to 1977), Virginia Tech (from 1978 to 1986) and Wake Forest (from 1987 to 1992). In the December 1971 Gator Bowl, played in Jacksonville, Florida, the two brothers found themselves on opposing sidelines. Vince's son, Derek Dooley, is currently the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Missouri. Derek is a former head football coach at both the University of Tennessee (from 2010 to 2012) and Louisiana Tech University (from 2007 to 2009). Derek also served as athletics director during his time at Louisiana Tech (from 2008 to 2010). He is also a former assistant coach for the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the University of Georgia, and LSU. Post-coaching career After leading UGA to 201 victories, 6 SEC championships, and one national championship as head football coach, Dooley retired to focus on his post as athletic director, which he had held since 1979. Dooley built Georgia into one of the most successful athletic programs in America. During his time as athletic director he hired former football coach Mark Richt from Florida State University. Dooley briefly pursued the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 1986. His wife, the former Barbara Meshad, ran in the Republican Party primary for U.S. House in 2002. Dooley is a member of the Gridiron Secret Society. On December 2, 2009, Kennesaw State University hired Dooley to begin working as a consultant to KSU in the school's drive to start a football program. Another hobby of Dooley's is gardening, about which he has published a book.\\"Never a Bad Day\\". HOOTERS magazine. November/ December 2010. pp. 117-9. Dooley has also partnered with Mascot Books to publish two children's books about the UGA mascot, How 'Bout Them Dawgs! and Hairy Dawg's Journey Through the Peach State. Dooley served as Chairman of the Board of Curators for the Georgia Historical Society from 2016‚Äì2018. Awards and honors Dooley was inducted in the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1978, the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1994. He received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award, presented by the American Football Coaches Association in 2001. In 2004 the U.S. Sports Academy presented Dooley with the Carl Maddox Sport Management Award, an award given annually to an individual for contribution to the growth and development of sports through management practices. Also in 2004, Dooley was inducted into UGA's Circle of Honor, which is the school's highest tribute to former athletes and coaches. In September 2007, Dooley was given the Homer Rice Award, the highest honor given by the Division I-A Athletic Directors Association. In 2007, Dooley was honored as a Star of the South by Irish America magazine. Dooley was inducted as a Georgia Trustee in 2011. Given by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia, to individuals whose accomplishments and community service reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752. During a ceremony on January 25, 2013, he was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame. In 2018, the Georgia Historical Society established the Vincent J. Dooley Distinguished Fellows Program in honor of Dooley. The Dooley Distinguished Fellows Program is designed to accomplish two goals consistent with Coach Dooley's life and legacy: recognizing senior scholars in the field of history and mentoring and developing emerging historians. Historian David Blight and author Rick Atkinson have been named Vincent J. Dooley Distinguished Teaching Fellows.

Mega Man X is an android who, along with his partner Zero, are elite members of the Maverick Hunters, a special police force tasked for defending humans and Reploids (androids who are based on X's design) against criminal Reploids, known as Mavericks. Mega Man X has appeared in multiple printed adaptations of the series as well as an original video animation, Day of Sigma, which explores his early days as a hunter. Mega Man X is also a supporting character in the Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX video game series. Outside of the main Mega Man franchise, X has appeared in multiple crossover video games series. The character was created by Keiji Inafune as a successor to the original Mega Man. He was given a darker characterization and multiple sets of armor that enhanced his skills to contrast him from his predecessor. Besides Inafune, X was overseen by artist Hayato Kaji. The character has been voiced by multiple actors in both Japanese and English versions of the franchise. Critical reaction to X has been generally positive, with game journalists often finding him a worthy successor to Mega Man based on his unique traits. His partnership with Zero was also praised due to their different and complementary skills. X was noted to be less popular than his ally while his English voice actors were often seen as unfit for his characterization. Creation and development=Original concept left When the Nintendo Entertainment System system began being overshadowed by its successor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Keiji Inafune embraced the improved graphics engine and developed a darker plot and character design. Inafune felt that the original Mega Man was too good and that his successor should have an \\"edge\\". In line with the new \\"X\\" series developed, two characters were created: one being the main character, X, and the other his partner, Zero. In the original Mega Man series, Inafune usually designed the protagonist while his prot√©g√© Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters; however, their roles were reversed for Mega Man X. Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X but had a difficult time with the initial design. However, he was then presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed to, due to the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that Mega Man had always represented a classic action game formula where the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept. Inafune created the character Zero, whom he originally intended to be the game's main, playable protagonist. \\"When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man,\\" Inafune explained. \\"I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I‚Äôm a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn‚Äôt want to use the same old Mega Man.\\" Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. Inafune noted that in early sketches, X and Zero were too similar, so Capcom aimed to make their silhouettes contrast one another due to make the merchandise easier to distinguish. Early illustrations of X made him look like a \\"cold-blooded killer\\", which led artists to soften his features in later games. Since the series' beginning, character designer Haruki Suetsugu was impressed by the handling of the relationship between X and Zero. From his point of view, X was a character who often makes mistakes in combat and constantly tries to improve. As a result, the artist felt he could relate with X, who was written to be a \\"B class\\" Hunter in contrast to Zero being the superior \\"Special A\\" rank. This allowed him to draw more frequently across the series. Suetsugu replaced Infanune as desgigner starting in the fourth game. Nevertheless, he regretted some of his illustrations as X lacked the appeal that Zero originally had. Development and designs While X has been redrawn multiple times, Capcom redesigned him for the spin- off Command Mission, feeling his original form was too simple. This design returned in Infinite. For the fourth title, Hitoshi Ariga was responsible for designing X's secret featured in both the game after inputting a cheat code and as a Japanese Bandai action figure. He spent four days coming up with the initial blueprint, but was told by his supervisor to revise it. After tinkering with the Mega Man X3 armor parts, he noticed that attaching them in specific ways made them look like an airplane. Ariga remembered creating the armor as an extremely difficult yet fun task. He also revealed that Zero was intended to have his own Ultimate Armor, but the development team chose to not finalize it. X's new was designed by Ryuji Higurashi for X5, who wanted it to resemble a bird with a beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the Inazuman manga series. Inafune's only contribution to Mega Man X7 was lending advice to the illustrators on creating the new protagonist Axl. Inafune had been careful in making X and Zero unique when he originally designed them, and he wanted to give Axl the same treatment. In Mega Man X6, Suetsugu aimed to make the Blade and Shadow Armors look stylish. The cover art for the Japanese Saturn version of X4 depicts Zero standing alone in a dark setting. \\"Usually, not having the main character on the package would be unheard of,\\" Inafune stated. \\"But we had a lot of hardcore fans on the Saturn, so I figured it would be all right.\\" A \\"Special Limited Pack\\" edition of the game included the Ultimate Armor X action figure. Another armor based on the Ultimate's design was made for X to wear in the Mega Man X collection's Challenge Mode. The three main characters were revised for Mega Man X8 as Yoshikawa planned to give them more unique features. For Mega Man X: Command Mission, Assistant Producer Tatsuya Kitabayashi claimed the staff were fans of the main character and wanted to alter his design. This was mostly because Capcom felt X looked too simple. The Hyper Mode was exclusive to the playable characters X and Zero. However, because this gave them too large of an advantage over other party members, all other characters were given one Hyper Mode while X and Zero were given two each. The staff noted X's overall characterization was conflicted due to his pacifist nature while killing enemies. As a result, they decided to make a strong yet kind character in order to appeal to the fans, turning him \\"into a full-fledged hero\\". Nevertheless, the developers were afraid of a negative backlash if the fans found X and Zero to be too different from their original personas. The redesign involved a \\"beam scarf\\" that could be produced whenever X performed a dash. Mega Man Zeros main antagonist was a popular topic of discussion during production, and the developer often sought input from Capcom in this regard. Yoshihisa Tsuda jokingly suggested that they make the original Mega Man X the final boss, an idea that was accepted at first. According to director Ryota Ito, Inti Creates realized that it \\"wouldn't sit so well with the young boys and girls that really do see [X] as a hero\\", so they replaced him with Copy X just one month before release. Takahiro Sakurai is currently one of X's voice actors in Japanese. X and Zero were intended to appear in the cancelled game Maverick Hunter. Both Mega Man X and Zero would have featured alongside a new human sidekick who is a \\"Bruce Willis-like police officer.\\" The inclusion of the human sidekick was part of the game's \\"man versus machine contrast\\". It was to be the first of a trilogy of games; players would control X in the first two games while they would switch to Zero in the third game, who must destroy X (who had become \\"incredibly powerful and infinitely intelligent over the course of two games\\"). Voice actors X was first voiced in Japanese by Megumi Ogata, who considered the role to be a \\"first generation part\\" of her career alongside other series like Yu-Gi-Oh! due to voicing X and Yugi Mutou in their first appearance and later being replaced. Starting in Mega Man X4, X was given another voice actor, Kentar≈ç It≈ç. He was replaced by Showtaro Morikubo for the next works. The fourth voice actor currently voicing X since Mega Man X8 is Takahiro Sakurai, who said he enjoyed voicing X across the crossover Project X Zone as he remembered X's thoughts. Sakurai described X as a serious character who \\"hesitates and agonizes, but always keeps fighting. He recalls experiencing multiple sad feelings when acting as X. He is always fighting, not just against Mavericks but also his inner persona as while does not enjoy the chaos, he finds himself forced to fight to achieve peace. Similar to his experience when playing the Mega Man X games from the Super Nintendo he looked forward to the crossover due to his interactions with other famous characters.\\" X from the Mega Man Zero and ZX series is voiced by Takahiro Mizushima. In the English dub, X was given multiple voice actors starting with Michael Donovan in a crossover special, partnering up with the original Mega Man in the 1994 Ruby-Spears series. Ruth Shiraishi (who also voiced the original Mega Man in Mega Man 8) in Mega Man X4. Peter von Gomm voiced him in Mega Man X7. Mark Gatha replaced him in the next game, the first title's remake and the original video animation, Day of Sigma. Ted Sroka worked as X for the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, expressing joy when his role was revealed. Appearances=In the Mega Man X series In the original game Mega Man X, X was created by Dr. Thomas Light sometime in \\"20XX\\" and is the template on which all non-Light model mechanical beings known as Reploids are based. Light named him X after the variable \\"x\\" which, in algebraic terms, represents limitless possibility, like X's advanced systems. Light died before X's diagnostics were complete, and X was discovered in his capsule 100 years later by another scientist, Dr. Cain, who attempted to emulate X's technology and produced the first mass-produced Reploids: humanoid androids based on X's designs. Under Sigma's leadership, the Maverick Hunters were formed to combat them. However, Sigma becomes a Maverick and leads a massive revolt. X decides to stop Sigma, and teams up with Zero, one of the last remaining Hunters. The original video animation, The Day of Sigma, retells these events before the game begins. In the first game of the series, Mega Man X, X is defeated by the Maverick Vile but is rescued by Zero. In the game, X faces multiple Mavericks and reaches Sigma after defeating Vile with Zero's aid. After X defeats Sigma, he continues searching for Mavericks in order to achieve peace. He and Zero also appear as bosses in the game's remake, Maverick Hunter X if the player unlocks Vile. X's constant struggles in regard to defeating new Mavericks cause him to wonder if he is destined to be Zero's enemy fearing the possibility that he himself might be going Maverick in his ending from Mega Man X4 after a battle with the Repliforce military. By Mega Man X5, X can appear as a boss character in the final stages if the player uses Zero after he is infected by Sigma. While X continues facing Reploids that have become Mavericks as a result of a virus in Mega Man X6, he becomes reluctant to continue his missions in Mega Man X7 until he fears Red Alert's forces might result in more casualties. In the latest main title, Mega Man X8, X is playable alongside Zero and Axl who are shocked when they discover that all Reploids will become copies of Sigma in the future; as a result, they fear that the war will never end. X also appears in the spin- offs Mega Man Xtreme to fight Mavericks and partners with a computer genius named Middy, and Mega Man Xtreme 2 to fight against a \\"Soul Eraser\\" named Berkana who plans to resurrect a growing army of undead Mavericks from the past. In Mega Man X: Command Mission, X leads a resistance team to defeat the minions of the Rebellion Army. A mobile phone game also has X as a playable character. Although Mega Man X8 was released by the time of the mobile game, Capcom chose X's previous look due to it being more well-known. X also reprises his role from the first game in three mangas by Iwamoto Yoshihiro, and the prequel Irregular Maverick Hunter X by Ikehara Shigeto. Other appearances Outside of Mega Man X, X is present in the sequel series Mega Man Zero. Zero suffers from amnesia and believes that his friend X has conquered the world until a scientist named Ciel reveals he is a copy she created. The real X appears in the ending and, having tired of fighting, asks Zero to take his place on the battlefield. In the direct sequel, X's body is destroyed by Elpizo, but his mind remains active until he fades away in Mega Man Zero 3. X appeared in the Mega Man episode \\"Mega X\\" and was voiced by Michael Donovan. He follows Vile and Spark Mandrill to the present to stop them from taking Lightanium back to their own time to help Sigma finance his wars against humans. Like Mega Man, X has the ability to copy weapons from enemies by touching them, such as using Snake Man's weapon to destroy Dr. Wily's plasma cannon. An X outfit can be unlocked and worn by the character Frank West in Dead Rising, who also uses it as part of his hyper combo in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars. X appears in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as a DLC costume for both Frank and Zero and as a cameo appearance in Zero's ending. X also appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as part of Mega Man's Final Smash. Mii Gunners also have access to X's armor through paid DLC in both versions of 3DS/Wii U and Ultimate. X is also seen with Zero in Project X Zone and its sequel. X is a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite and Puzzle Fighter with his Command Mission design as an alternate skin. He also appears in the card game Teppen. X also makes guest appearances in the Mega Man comic series by Archie Comics, appearing in stories set shortly before the events of Mega Man X and as part of the \\"Worlds Unite\\" crossover event. Writers noted multiple fans sent them messages about the character prior to his introduction, but that they wanted to see X portrayed as a darker character. However, they aimed not to take the Command Mission incarnation which depicted X as more of a leader. Reception X has stood out within the franchise due to the armors he often wears. These are various armor sets that X can use in Mega Man X5. The initial reaction to X has been positive. US Gamer found him as a worthy successor to the original Mega Man based on his own skills such as dashes or tanks that increase the character's health bar. GamesRadar liked X's design, enjoying how in games he wears different armors that upgraded his skills while in some early titles he pays tribute to the Street Fighter characters by performing their techniques. Nintendo Life called his design a \\"more mature and gritty design\\" as the critic had grown tired of Capcom's original Mega Man who had appeared in multiple games, leading to dated elements. IGN made similar comments in regards to X's skills as \\"a great touch\\" due to how powerful the character can become. Push Square agreed with the critics \\"fresh\\" concepts that Capcom needed to provide in order to sell more video games. GameFan praised the new armor design provided for Mega Man X2, finding it more visually appealing than the original. Destructoid enjoyed how throughout the series X retains some old skills from the early games that could only be acquired through upgrades and the variety of armors in Mega Man X3. Electronic Gaming Monthly found X's actions too repetitive in the series by the third title gameplay-wise as the series lacked innovation. Game Informer had mixed thoughts about how X is handled in the series: while Game Informer praised his multiple visual appearances and usage of weapons, it criticized his child-like voice from Mega Man X4 as a poor fit with his character, something that Electronic Game Monthly agreed with. His voice actor for Maverick Hunter X was criticized for always sounding angry. On the other hand, GameZone praised Mark Gatha's acting as X due to how he interacts with the bosses. By Mega Man X4, critics praised the option of having Zero besides X as a protagonist as their different fighting styles gave more variety to the series. 1UP.com was displeased that in Mega Man X7, X cannot be used and his replacement, Axl, is unlikable. GameSpy agreed and found X's desire to leave the battlefield comical. Destructoid made similar comments stating fans might dislike X being unplayable during the game's early stages; however, Destructoid felt that Mega Man X8 improved in this regard, as X returns as a playable character. In regards to Command Mission, X was praised by GameSpy due to the series giving him a more elaborated storyline and characterized him as a veteran. In general, the cast was praised for their designs. Nintendo World Report was disappointed by X losing his trademark ability in this game of copying weapons, which is given to Axl. RPGFan regarded X as one of the best-written characters in Command Mission, though it considered X's voice unfitting and compared it to a boy scout's voice. Nevertheless, US Gamer found X's actions in the Zero series to be interesting considering Zero was a breakout character due to his large popularity in contrast to X's. GamesRadar considered both X and Zero as \\"crossover veterans\\" based on their multiple appearances and looked forward to when they joined forces for the first time in Project X Zone. Kyle Hilliard from Game Informer considered X and Zero as one of his favorite characters in gaming and wanted to play as them in Project X Zone 2. Clint Mize wrote an article for MTV's gaming section detailing why Maverick Hunter was a terrible idea. He felt that it could have turned off \\"core fans\\" of the Mega Man X series and that X required a \\"solid core title to reintroduce the character\\" rather than a \\"dark reimagining\\". Game Informer claimed X had the best weaponry in his introduction and that if Capcom were to make another Mega Man X, X's weaponry should be based on it. It also considered X's armors from X6, such as the Shadow and Falcon Armors, to be the best ones in the series. Zero was chosen to represent the \\"Mega Man\\" franchise over Mega Man or X himself in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, as director Ryota Niitsuma thought he had more variation in his moves. For Infinite, X was added due to his large popularity within the Western audience and was given his Command Mission design as an alternate skin. X's addition to the Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite cast has proven to be popular according to Polygon. However, the writer noted that despite fans' excitement with X's inclusion, many were displeased with his early defeat in a preview.

The $60 is multiplied by a factor of 1.2 and the resulting $72 is distributed equally among the four players. The public goods game is a standard of experimental economics. In the basic game, subjects secretly choose how many of their private tokens to put into a public pot. The tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor (greater than one and less than the number of players, N) and this \\"public good\\" payoff is evenly divided among players. Each subject also keeps the tokens they do not contribute. Results The group's total payoff is maximized when everyone contributes all of their tokens to the public pool. However, the Nash equilibrium in this game is simply zero contributions by all; if the experiment were a purely analytical exercise in game theory it would resolve to zero contributions because any rational agent does best contributing zero, regardless of whatever anyone else does. This only holds if the multiplication factor is less than the number of players, otherwise the Nash equilibrium is for all players to contribute all of their tokens to the public pool. In fact, the Nash equilibrium is rarely seen in experiments; people do tend to add something into the pot. The actual levels of contribution found varies widely (anywhere from 0% to 100% of initial endowment can be chipped in). \\\\- (This paper, from researchers at Indiana University and Florida State University summarizes the experimental findings of earlier research before comparing theoretical models against these results.) The average contribution typically depends on the multiplication factor. Capraro has proposed a new solution concept for social dilemmas, based on the idea that players forecast if it is worth to act cooperatively and then they act cooperatively in a rate depending on the forecast. His model indeed predicts increasing level of cooperation as the multiplication factor increases. Depending on the experiment's design, those who contribute below average or nothing are called \\"defectors\\" or \\"free riders\\", as opposed to the contributors or above average contributors who are called \\"cooperators\\". Variants=Iterated public goods games \\"Repeat-play\\" public goods games involve the same group of subjects playing the basic game over a series of rounds. The typical result is a declining proportion of public contribution, from the simple game (the \\"One-shot\\" public goods game). When trusting contributors see that not everyone is giving up as much as they do they tend to reduce the amount they share in the next round. If this is again repeated the same thing happens but from a lower base, so that the amount contributed to the pot is reduced again. However, the amount contributed to the pool rarely drops to zero when rounds of the game are iterated, because there tend to remain a hard core of ‚Äògivers‚Äô. One explanation for the dropping level of contribution is inequity aversion. During repeated games players learn their co-player's inequality aversion in previous rounds on which future beliefs can be based. If players receive a bigger share for a smaller contribution the sharing members react against the perceived injustice (even though the identity of the ‚Äúfree riders‚Äù are unknown, and it's only a game). Those who contribute nothing in one round, rarely contribute something in later rounds, even after discovering that others are.  Open public goods games (Transparency)  Transparency about past choices and payoffs of group members affects future choices. Studies show individuals in groups can be influenced by the group leaders, whether formal or informal, to conform or defect. Players signal their intentions through transparency which allows ‚Äúconditional operators‚Äù to follow the lead.Fiala, Lenka and Sigrid Suetens. ‚ÄúTransparency and cooperation in repeated dilemma games: a meta study‚Äù Experimental economics vol. 20,4 (2017): 755-771. If players are informed of individual payoffs of each member of the group it can lead to a dynamic of players adopting the strategy of the player who benefited the most (contributed the least) in the group. This can lead a drop in cooperation through subsequent iterations of the game.Fiala, Lenka, and Sigrid Suetens. ‚ÄúTransparency and Cooperation in Repeated Dilemma Games: a Meta Study.‚Äù SpringerLink, Springer, 24 Feb. 2017, link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10683-017-9517-4. However, if the amount contributed by each group member is not hidden, the amount contributed tends to be significantly higher. The finding is robust in different experiment designs: Whether in \\"pairwise iterations\\" with only two players (the other player's contribution level is always known) or in nominations after the end of the experiment.  Public goods games with punishment and/or reward  The option to punish non-contributors and to reward the highest contributions after a round of the public goods game has been the issue of many experiments. Findings strongly suggest that non-rewarding is not seen as sanction, while rewards don't substitute punishment. Rather they are used completely differently as a means to enforce cooperation and higher payoffs. Punishing is exercised, even at a cost, and in most experiments it leads to greater group cooperation. However, since punishment is costly, it tends to lead to (marginally) lower payoffs, at least initially. On the other hand, a 2007 study found that rewards alone could not sustain long-term cooperation. Many studies therefore emphasize the combination of (the threat of) punishment and rewards. The combination seems to yield both a higher level of cooperation and of payoffs. This holds for iterated games in changing groups as well as in identical groups.  Asymmetric costs and/or benefits  Asymmetric cost and or benefit functions have direct influence in the contribution behaviour of agents. When confronted with different payoff returns to their contributions, agents behave differently though they still contribute more than in Nash equilibrium. Income variation A public goods games variant suggested as an improvement for researching the free rider problem is one in which endowment are earned as income. The standard game (with a fixed initial endowments) allows no work effort variation and cannot capture the marginal substitutions among three factors: private goods, public goods, and leisure. Researchers have found that in an experiment where an agent's wealth at the end of period t serves as her endowment in t+1, the amounts contributed increase over time even in the absences of punishment strategies.  Framing  A different framing of the original neutral experiment setting induces players to act differently because they associate different real-life situations. For example, a public good experiment could be presented as a climate negotiation or as contributions to private parties. The effect of associations (label frame) depends on the experience-pool the player made with similar real-life frames. This is especially true for one-shot (not iterated) games where players can only infer others‚Äô behavior and expectations from their life experiences. Therefore, the same frame can induce more and also less contribution, even in similar cultures. Label frames move beliefs i.e. about other player's behaviour, and these beliefs subsequently shape motivation and choice. Also, the same game structure can always be presented as a gain or a loss game. Because of the Framing effect players respond completely differently when it is presented as a gain or a loss. If public good games are presented as a loss, i.e. a player's contribution in a private engagement diminishes other player's payoff, contributions are significantly lower. Multiplication factor For contribution to be privately \\"irrational\\" the tokens in the pot must be multiplied by an amount smaller than the number of players and greater than 1. Other than this, the level of multiplication has little bearing on strategy, but higher factors produce higher proportions of contribution. With a large group (40) and very low multiplication factor (1.03) almost no-one contributes anything after a few iterations of the game (a few still do). However, with the same size group and a 1.3 multiplication factor the average level of initial endowment contributed to the pot is around 50%. Implications The name of the game comes from economist‚Äôs definition of a ‚Äúpublic good‚Äù. One type of public good is a costly, \\"non-excludable\\" project that every one can benefit from, regardless of how much they contribute to create it (because no one can be excluded from using it - like street lighting). Part of the economic theory of public goods is that they would be under-provided (at a rate lower than the ‚Äòsocial optimum‚Äô) because individuals had no private motive to contribute (the free rider problem). The ‚Äúpublic goods game‚Äù is designed to test this belief and connected theories of social behaviour. Game theory The empirical fact that subjects in most societies contribute anything in the simple public goods game is a challenge for game theory to explain via a motive of total self-interest, although it can do better with the ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô variant, or the ‚Äòiterated‚Äô variant; because some of the motivation to contribute is now purely ‚Äúrational‚Äù, if players assume that others may act irrationally and punish them for non- contribution. Applications to sociology The sociological interpretation of these results emphasizes group cohesion and cultural norms to explain the \\"prosocial\\" outcomes of public goods games.

Lindsay Jr. (July 10, 1927 February 14, 2000) was an American Southern Baptist preacher. He co-pastored the nation's third-largest Southern Baptist church, the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Florida, with Jerry Vines. Both pastors are notable for their conservative and sometimes controversial public stances, and their wide-reaching influence in the local political arena. According to Paige Patterson, Lindsay was \\"one of the great soul-winners of all Christian history\\". History Lindsay was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and moved to Jacksonville with his family as a child. His father, Homer G. Lindsay Sr., began pastoring the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville in 1940. At the age of 16, Homer Junior felt the call to become a preacher, and later graduated from Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, going on to study ministry at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. In September 1952 he married Shirley Tillman of Lake Wales, Florida and began pastoring a 42-member church in Miami, Florida. By the late 1960s, the church had grown to 3,200 members. In January 1969, Lindsay returned to Jacksonville to co-pastor the 2,600-member First Baptist Church with his father, who later retired in 1973 and died in 1981. By the time of Lindsay's retirement in 1999, the church had a Sunday morning attendance of about 7,000, eighteen ordained ministers, an annual budget of over $9 million, full-time staff of 142, and land and other assets valued at about $6 million.

It is occasionally known as the Gilbert‚ÄìShannon‚ÄìVarshamov bound (or the GSV bound), but the name \\"Gilbert‚ÄìVarshamov bound\\" is by far the most popular. Varshamov proved this bound by using the probabilistic method for linear codes. For more about that proof, see Gilbert‚ÄìVarshamov bound for linear codes. Statement of the bound Let :A_q(n,d) denote the maximum possible size of a q-ary code C with length n and minimum Hamming distance d (a q-ary code is a code over the field \\\\mathbb{F}_q of q elements). Then: :A_q(n,d) \\\\geqslant \\\\frac{q^n}{\\\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\\\binom{n}{j}(q-1)^j}. Proof Let C be a code of length n and minimum Hamming distance d having maximal size: :C=A_q(n,d). Then for all x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{F}_q^n , there exists at least one codeword c_x \\\\in C such that the Hamming distance d(x,c_x) between x and c_x satisfies :d(x,c_x)\\\\leqslant d-1 since otherwise we could add x to the code whilst maintaining the code's minimum Hamming distance d ‚Äì a contradiction on the maximality of C. Hence the whole of \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n is contained in the union of all balls of radius d-1 having their centre at some c \\\\in C : :\\\\mathbb{F}_q^n =\\\\bigcup_{c \\\\in C} B(c,d-1). Now each ball has size : \\\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\\\binom{n}{j}(q-1)^j since we may allow (or choose) up to d-1 of the n components of a codeword to deviate (from the value of the corresponding component of the ball's centre) to one of (q-1) possible other values (recall: the code is q-ary: it takes values in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n). Hence we deduce :q^n = \\\\left \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n \\\\right  = \\\\left \\\\bigcup_{c \\\\in C} B(c,d-1) \\\\right  \\\\leqslant \\\\sum_{c \\\\in C} B(c,d-1) = C\\\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\\\binom{n}{j}(q-1)^j That is: : A_q(n,d) = C \\\\geqslant \\\\frac{q^n}{\\\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\\\binom{n}{j}(q-1)^j}. An improvement in the prime power case For q a prime power, one can improve the bound to A_q(n,d)\\\\ge q^k where k is the greatest integer for which : q^k < \\\\frac{q^n}{\\\\sum_{j=0}^{d-2} \\\\binom{n-1}{j}(q-1)^j}.

The principles Littlewood stated the principles in his 1944 Lectures on the Theory of Functions as: The first principle is based on the fact that the inner measure and outer measure are equal for measurable sets, the second is based on Lusin's theorem, and the third is based on Egorov's theorem. Example Littlewood's three principles are quoted in several real analysis texts, for example Royden, Bressoud, and Stein & Shakarchi. RoydenRoyden (1988), p. 84 gives the bounded convergence theorem as an application of the third principle. The theorem states that if a uniformly bounded sequence of functions converges pointwise, then their integrals on a set of finite measure converge to the integral of the limit function. If the convergence were uniform this would be a trivial result, and Littlewood's third principle tells us that the convergence is almost uniform, that is, uniform outside of a set of arbitrarily small measure. Because the sequence is bounded, the contribution to the integrals of the small set can be made arbitrarily small, and the integrals on the remainder converge because the functions are uniformly convergent there.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is away from the Philippine capital Manila and is part of Manila's conurbation which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part.Obando, Bayang Pinagpala! (Obando, Blessed Town!), Pamahalaang Bayan ng Obando (Local Government of Obando), 2006/2007 History In the 18th century, the municipalities now known as Meycauayan, Valenzuela (formerly Polo) and Obando comprised only one town, the Municipality of Meycauayan. The town of Polo and Obando, formed a barrio called Catanghalan. In the year 1623, the municipality of Polo was organized which included the present-day territories of the Town of Obando. By virtue of a decree promulgated during the time of Governor and Captain General of the Archipelago, Francisco Jose de Obando y Solis, the town was created and separated from its mother town Polo on May 14, 1753. In the Governor's untimely death at the hands of the British during the Seven Years' War, the creation and establishment of the town was made and attended by the Alcalde Mayor of the province, Don Francisco Morales y Mozabe, the Provincial Minister, S. Gregorio, Rev. Fr. Alejandro Ferrer, together with numerous religious devotees. The minister who was chosen to administer the town was Rev. Fr. Manuel De Olivencia. In 1907, Obando was made an independent town of Bulacan. Then through the untiring efforts of the municipal officials, a portion of Gasak, Navotas was reclaimed to form a part of Obando. The municipal officials, believing that this portion was once a part of the municipality but was adopted by Navotas in the course of time, effortlessly pushed through its claim to regain the area. The concerted action of all those concerned paid off when on January 30, 1975, by virtue of a Presidential Decree No. 646, a portion of approximately 1.78 square kilometers of Gasak, Navotas was returned to Obando. This is mostly fishpond and sandy beach and believed that when fully developed, this will serve as a good tourist attraction. By resolution of 1975 Municipal Council, the area was made into a barangay and named it Nuestra Se√±ora de Salambao in honor of one of its patron saints. Geography Obando is bordered by Valenzuela City in the east, Navotas City and Malabon City in the south, Bulakan in the north, and the waters of Manila Bay in the west. Flat and low-lying coastal plains characterize the general topography of Obando. The area was formerly an estuary, but it filled up partially from the peripheral parts of each sand bar and sand spit and formed up into current figure that mainly consisted of commercial district, partly industrial district, residential area and fishpond. Within the municipality are two rivers and three creeks namely Meycauayan River, in the north, Pinagkabalian River, in the south and Paco Creek, Hulo Creek and Pag-asa Creek traversing the town parallel to the provincial road. Obando, just like the other towns of Bulacan, has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet season. The wet season is from May to October and the dry season is from November to April. The rainfall of the wet season accounts for about 80% of the annual rainfall, which is due to west monsoons and typhoons. Barangays Obando is politically subdivided into 11 barangays (8 urban, 3 rural). Barangays Binuangan (ancient \\"Binwangan\\" mentioned on the Laguna Copperplate Inscription which is the oldest written document of Philippines inscribed in Indianized script dates back to 900 CE) and Salambao are located along the Paliwas River, and can only be reached by means of motorized boats. Climate=Demographics In the , the population of Obando, Bulacan, was people, with a density of . In 2002, Obando had an estimated population of 58,245 wherein 49% are male and 51% are female. Of the current population, about 14% live in rural barangays while the rest constitute the urban population. There are 12,349 households. The average monthly income of a household is P9,000.00, slightly below the P9,540.00 minimum for a family of 6 threshold set by Department of Social Welfare and Development. Television and Radio Obando is also the transmitter site of some AM stations, primarily broadcasting the Mega Manila area. Among them are: * Super Radyo DZBB 594 (GMA Network) * DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 (ABS-CBN Corporation) * DWIZ 882 (Aliw Broadcasting Corporation) * DZIQ Radyo Inquirer 990 (Trans-Radio Broadcasting Corporation) * DZEC Radyo Agila 1062 (Eagle Broadcasting Corporation) * INC Radio DZEM 954 (Christian Era Broadcasting Service International) * DZME 1530 (Capitol Broadcasting Center) Environmental Issues River pollution caused by the Tanza, Navotas dumpsite remains a problem. In 2002, under the leadership of Mayor Nesty Joaquin, the Sangguniang Bayan of Obando, Bulacan passed a controversial resolution allowing all the Phileco (Philippine Ecology Systems Corp.) barges that contains tons of Metro Manila's garbage to pass the river of Obando and dumped it in a river-turned \\"controlled\\" dumpsite facility in Tanza, Navotas which is only 1 km away from Obando. Mass actions followed but local officials failed to stop the dumping up to this date. Studies showed that the operation of the dump was polluting the river and had caused several diseases among residents, mostly old folks, women and children. The Obando Landfill poses a concern because of the possibility of flooding. Environment Secretary Ramon J.P. Paje has been asked to revoke the environmental compliance certificate that his department issued to a landfill project for aggravating the situation in Obando town of Bulacan. Coalition president Roy Alvarez warned Paje the flooding in Obando is proof that the fishing town is a flood-prone area and the construction of a sanitary landfill is a blunder. The threat of extreme weather disturbances due to climate change and constructing a landfill in a flood disaster hotspot like Obando, Alvarez said. Citizens‚Äô groups, religious associations, an environmental health coalition and a fisherfolk alliance, had asked Paje to stop the construction of the 44-hectare landfill in Barangay Salambao in Obando. They cited the proximity of the waste disposal facility to Obando River and Manila Bay. The protesters said that the Obando landfill project is illegal and violative of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act. They expressed belief the landfill will prejudice the health of Obando River and its people, worsen the decades-old flooding problem in the town, contribute to the deterioration of Manila Bay and destroy the livelihood of tens of thousands of people. The said project was approved without public hearing and backed up by its then Mayor Orencio E. Gabriel, councilors Aries Manalaysay, Dhey Alejo, Virgilio Cruz, Arvin dela Cruz, Edmon Papa, Jocelyn Gutierrez-Garcia, Bulacan governor Willy Alvarado. Businessman Antonio L.

It has just two cells, and most games are winnable with good play. Rules The player deals four cards from the deck. These four cards form the foundations. They are turned sideways (although it is not necessary to do so). The rest of the cards are dealt into eight columns of six cards each on the tableau. These cards can only be built up on the foundations regardless of suit and they cannot be built on each other. The initial layout of a game of Stalactites. Before the game starts, the player can decide on how the foundations should be built. Building can be either in ones (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K) or in twos (A-3-5-7-9-J-K-2-4-6-8-10-Q). Once the player makes up his mind, he begins building on the foundations from the cards on the tableau. The foundations are built, as already mentioned, up regardless of suit, and it goes round the corner, building from King to Ace (if building by ones) or from Queen to Ace (if building by twos) if necessary. The foundation cards turned sideways, though not necessarily be done, is a reminder of the last card's rank on each foundation. The cards in the tableau should be placed in the foundations according to the building method the player decides to use. But when there are cards that cannot (or does not want to) be moved to the foundations, certain cards can be placed on a reserve. Any card can be placed on the reserve. But once a card is placed on the reserve, it must be built on a foundation; it should never return to the tableau. Furthermore, the reserve can only hold two cards. The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations, each having 13 cards. The four starting cards in the foundations don't have to be of the same rank; so results vary with each won game.

Its purposes are centered on enforcing constitutional order. The Estonian Internal Security Service has primary investigative jurisdiction in some offences committed by state officials; countering terrorism; incitement to hatred; crimes against humanity and peace, including war crimes; illegal handling and trafficking of firearms, ammunition, explosives, radioactive material or other strategic materials; and the protection of state secrets. It also fills counterintelligence duties. The Estonian Internal Security Service is administered as an agency of the Estonian Ministry of Internal Affairs. While many of the Estonian Internal Security Service's activities are classified, its overview of the status of national security is published yearly as the Kaitsepolitsei aastaraamat. History Kaitsepolitseiamet was first established on April 12, 1920. From 1925 to 1940 the institution was known as Political Police (Poliitiline politsei, abbreviated PolPol). The PolPol fought against subversive activities of political extremists, espionage, desertion, smuggling and terrorism. The most discussed targets were the Estonian communists whose party had been declared an illegal organisation following the failed December coup, forcing them to operate clandestinely and through various legal fronts, usually as workers' organisations. Communists were supported by the Soviet Union, who had publicly accepted the principles not recognizing the parliamentary order, seeing terrorism as a legitimate activity. Similarly, the PolPol surveyed pro-Nazi oriented Baltic Germans and extreme monarchists of the White Russian emigres. When the Soviet Union annexed Estonia on June 17, 1940 the PolPol was one of the first institutions which was practically in corpore repressed - almost all of its employees were deported in course of June deportations; before the end of the World War II more than 90% of the PolPol employees and their families were killed. Re- establishment The Estonian Internal Security Service was reestablished on March 1, 1991, as a part of restoration of Estonian independence from the Soviet occupation. Until June 18, 1993, the Estonian Internal Security Service was a department of the central police structure; then, it was reorganised as a distinct entity. Following adoption of a new law of security services on March 1, 2001, the status of the Estonian Internal Security Service was reclassified from a police institution to a security service. According to an Amnesty International report from 2009: \\"In June, the Estonian Security Police Board published its annual report which made serious allegations against the Legal Information Centre for Human Rights (LICHR), an NGO promoting and defending the rights of those belonging to linguistic minorities. The report stated that the LICHR was used by the Russian Federation to carry out scientific research for propaganda purposes, and accused the LICHR of trying to conceal the specific sources of funding it received from the Russian Federation. These allegations were widely seen as an attempt by the government to misrepresent the LICHR and to undermine its attempts to secure the necessary financial and social support to carry out its work.\\" Criticism against the Estonian Internal Security Service has been presented by Risto Teinonen, a Finnish lawyer and neo-Nazi living in Tallinn. In 2009, Teinonen launched criminal proceedings against the Estonian Internal Security Service in a Tallinn court, accusing the organization of politically motivated persecution of innocent people.

It is the tallest building in the Pennsylvania Plaza complex of office buildings, hotels, and entertainment facilities.  History  The skyscraper was designed by Kahn & Jacobs and completed in 1972. It reaches with 57 floors. The tower has three setbacks at 7th, 14th, and 55th floors. From its location on the west side of Manhattan, most south, west and north-facing tenants have unobstructed views of the Hudson River. The lobby was refurbished in 1995 and is undergoing another refurbishment beginning in 2019. One Penn Plaza is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust. It was previously owned by Helmsley-Spear Inc., which sold the building for $420 million in the late 1990s. In 2009, plans were made to install a cogeneration plant in order to heat the building more efficiently. By 2010, it was reported that when the new plant was activated, it nearly cut the building's carbon output in half.

It was the first to offer a pressurized cabin, allowing it to cruise at an altitude of 20,000 ft (6,000 m), well above many weather disturbances. The pressure differential was 2.5 psi (17 kPa), so at 14,700 ft (4,480 m) the cabin air pressure was equivalent to an altitude of 8,000 ft (2,440 m). The Model 307 had capacity for a crew of six and 33 passengers. The cabin was nearly 12 ft (3.6 m) across. It was the first land-based aircraft to include a flight engineer as a crew member (several flying boats had included a flight engineer position earlier). In addition to its civilian service it was also flown as the Boeing C-75 Stratoliner by the United States Army Air Forces, who used it as a long- range cargolift aircraft. Development and design In 1935, Boeing designed a four-engine airliner based on its B-17 heavy bomber (Boeing Model 299), then in development, calling it the Model 307. It combined the wings, tail, rudder, landing gear, and engines from their production B-17C with a new, circular cross-section fuselage of diameter, designed to allow pressurization.Hardy, Air International January 1994, p. 21. The first order, for two 307s (named Stratoliners), was placed in 1937 by Pan American Airways. Pan Am soon increased this to six, and a second order for five from Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) prompted Boeing to begin production on an initial batch of the airliner. Pan Am received its initial order and TWA received its order, but only one of the second batch of four Pan Am aircraft was delivered before war intervened and put a halt to civil aircraft production.Bowers 1989, p. 231. C-75 conversion At the time the United States entered World War II in December 1941, flying across oceans was a rare luxury. The war required government and military officials to do so, and most four-engined long-range commercial aircraft, including Pan American Airways' 14 flying boats and TWA's five Boeing 307s, were pressed into service. Additional fuel tanks were added to give them the extra range required; once converted they were designated C-75 for military use. Before World War II ended their production, ten commercial 307s had been built. TWA flew domestic routes between New York and Los Angeles for 18 months until the Army purchased their Stratoliners for wartime use as long-range, transatlantic transports for various VIPs or critical cargo on January 26, 1942. TWA converted their 307s to military service in January 1942,Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II. London: Random House, 1989. . and its Intercontinental Division (ICD) then operated these C-75s under contract to the Army's Air Transport Command (ATC) until July 1944.Betts, Ed. \\"The Boeing Stratoliners and TWA\\". American Aviation Historical Society Journal, Volume 38, Issue 3, 1993. These were the only U. S. built commercial aircraft able to cross the Atlantic with a payload until the arrival of the Douglas C-54 Skymaster in November 1942. Conversion to the C-75 included removal of the pressurization equipment to save weight, removal of the forward four (or five) of nine reclining seats along the port side, and alteration of the two forward Pullman-like compartments (of four) starboard of the left-of-centerline aisle. Space was thus provided for crew requirements on extremely long flights and for the addition of five fuel tanks. The landing gear was strengthened, the maximum takeoff weight was increased from , and the exterior was painted military olive drab. Operational history The maiden flight of the first Boeing 307 Stratoliner (not a prototype, as it was planned to be delivered to Pan Am following testing and certification), registration NX 19901 took place from Boeing Field, Seattle on December 31, 1938.Ford 2004, p. 55. This aircraft crashed on March 18, 1939, while being demonstrated to representatives of KLM. After takeoff the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 11,000 feet. At this altitude, longitudinal stability tests were made. The next tests, as outlined by the flight plan, were side-slip tests. The aircraft went into an inadvertent spin subsequent to a stall at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet. It made two to three turns in the spin, during which the engines were used to aid recovery. In recovering from the dive subsequent to the spin, the wings and horizontal tail surfaces failed upward apparently due to air loads in excess of those for which the aircraft was designed. The ten people aboard, including the KLM technical director, a representative of the Dutch Air Ministry, a Boeing test pilot, the Boeing Chief Aerodynamicist, the Boeing Chief Engineer, and a TWA representative were killed.Air Safety Board Report involving NX19901, of the Boeing Aircraft Company, near Alder, Washington, March 18, 1939 Subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of an extended dorsal fin ahead of and attached to the vertical tail prevented rudder lock. This was incorporated into the 307's rudder redesign, while also being incorporated in Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for their models \\"E\\" through \\"G\\" B-17 bomber.Abzug, Malcolm J. and E. Eugene Larrabee. Airplane Stability and Control: A History of the Technologies that Made Aviation Possible. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005. . The first delivery to a customer was to multi-millionaire Howard Hughes, who bought one 307 (NX-19904) for a round-the-world flight, hoping to break his own record of 91 hours 14 minutes set from July 10‚Äì14, 1938 in a Lockheed 14. Hughes' Boeing Stratoliner was fitted with extra fuel tanks and was ready to set out on the first leg of the round-the-world attempt when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, causing the attempt to be abandoned. This 307 later had the extra fuel tanks removed, was fitted with much more powerful Wright R-2600 engines, and was transformed into the luxurious \\"The Flying Penthouse\\" for Hughes, although it was little used, eventually being sold to oil tycoon Glenn McCarthy in 1949.Hardy, Air International, January 1994, pp. 22‚Äì23. Deliveries to Pan Am started in March 1940, with TWA receiving its first 307 in April. TWA's Stratoliners flew three-stop flights between Los Angeles and New York while Pan Am's flew from Miami to Latin America. Ten 307s were built, three being delivered to Pan-Am (NC-19902:Clipper Rainbow, NC-19903:Clipper Flying Cloud, and NC-19910:Clipper Comet) and five to TWA (NC-19905:Comanche, NC-19906:Cherokee, NC-19907:Zuni, NC-19908:Apache, and NC-19909:Navajo) with one aircraft going to Hughes (NX-19904).Munson 1972, p. 182. On the entry of the United States into World War II, Pan Am (PAA) continued operating its Stratoliners on routes to Central and South America, but under direction of the Army Air Forces' Air Transport Command,Taylor 1979, p.59. while the TWA 307s were sold to the United States government, being designated Boeing C-75 (42-88623/27) and operated by the United States Army Air Forces (although normally still flown by TWA crews).Hardy, Air International February 1994, p. 69. The Army returned its five C-75s to TWA in 1944, which sent them back to Boeing for rebuilding. Boeing replaced the wings and horizontal tail with those from the B-17G, while more powerful engines were fitted and the electrical system was replaced with one based on the B-29 Superfortress. Passenger capacity was increased from 33 to 38.Bowers 1989, pp. 234‚Äì235. The total rebuilding cost to TWA was $2 million; the five aircraft re-entered passenger service on April 1, 1945. Although TWA was committed to the larger and faster Lockheed Constellation, it kept the Stratoliners until April 1951.Hardy, Air International February 1994, p. 70. Paya Lebar in 1967 Pan Am flew its unmodified 33-passenger Stratoliners between Miami and Havana until 1947, then sold them to small operators, including Aerovias Ecuatorianas AREA). Some later returned to the US, whilst others went to South-East Asia to replace write-offs. One aircraft (N-19903) was purchased by the Haitian Air Force, being fitted as a Presidential transport for Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier. This aircraft later returned to the U.S. and was purchased by the Smithsonian Museum.Hardy, Air International February 1994, p. 71. TWA sold its Stratoliner fleet, of five, to the French airline Aigle Azur, which used them (F-BELU, F-BELV, F-BELX, F-BELY, F-BELZ) on scheduled flights from France to North and Central Africa, and later to French Indo-China. Three aircraft were transferred (F-BELU, F-BELV, F-BELX) to Aigle Azur's Vietnamese subsidiary (Aigle Azur Extr√™me-Orient) and were used in South East Asia, in various liveries and with various registrations, with at least one aircraft remaining in commercial use until 1974.Hardy, Air International February 1994, pp. 70‚Äì72. Two aircraft remained in Europe (F-BELY, F-BELZ) and passed to Mediterranean runs, especially around Corsica, with: Airnautic. The exact history of the five aircraft becomes quite complex as the subsidiary was sold to UAT in 1955, and this in turn merged to become UTA in 1963, whilst the original branding was kept until 1961. Also, some of these aircraft were under contract to the ICC/CIC [see below], running both ad hoc flights plus regular scheduled services for diplomats between the various, often hostile, capitals. Aircraft write-offs required buying-up some of the remaining 307s, for ease of maintenance and continuity of service, so F-BELY also went East, as did the ex-Pan Am F-BHHR. At various times following independence, most received local (usually Lao) registrations (XW-PGR; XW-TAA, XW-TAB, XW-TAC; XW-tFP, XW-TFR), possibly for legal/fiscal reasons, whilst maintaining essentially the same services. Some were registered to the CITCA leasing company, whilst some formed the basis of the national-carrier Royal Air Lao. C-75 Two main routes were flown: Washington, D.C., to Cairo across the South Atlantic, and New York to Prestwick, Scotland, across the North Atlantic.Berry, Peter. \\"Transatlantic Flight 1938‚Äì1945 (Part I 1938‚Äì1943)\\". AAHS Journal, Volume 40, Issue 2, 1995. They often flew non-stop the 2,125 statute miles (3,415 km) between Gander, Newfoundland and Prestwick, Scotland in the north, and the 2,550 statute miles (4,100 km) between Natal, Brazil and Accra, Ghana in the south. After July 1942 a refueling stop at Ascension Island was an option in the south.Berry, Peter. \\"Transatlantic Flight 1938‚Äì1945 (Part II 1943‚Äì1945)\\". AAHS Journal, Volume 40, Issue 3, 1995. In the north, stops at Iceland or Greenland were often necessary, especially flying westbound against the prevailing winds. As C-54s took over the Gander to Prestwick route, the C-75s operated a Marrakech-to-Prestwick service out over the Atlantic. In April 1945, the five C-75s were returned to TWA, having been restored by Boeing and recertified by the CAA as SA-307B-1 civilian transports with their old registration numbers. TWA then restyled the interior cabin in two sections, ten seats forward and 28 aft.

Four of the eight incidents were fatal, with one an apparent shoot-down in a zone of conflict; casualties, by number, in the four incidents were: 25, 19, 13 & 10 (total: 67). *March 18, 1939: the first Boeing 307 (NX19901) crashed in the old town of Alder, near Mt. Rainier, during a demonstration flight for KLM, killing all ten on board. The aircraft went into a spin. The pilot attempted to recover, but this caused the aircraft to break up.Air Safety Board Report involving NX19901, of the Boeing Aircraft Company, near Alder, Washington, March 18, 1939. *May 10, 1958: a Quaker City Airways Boeing 307 (N75385) force-landed near Madras, Oregon, after an explosion and fire in the cabin, possibly due to a fuel leak; the aircraft was consumed by the fire. Both pilots survived; the aircraft was on a test flight (ex-PanAm: NC-19910; ex-Ecuatorianas: HC-004). *May 22, 1961: an Aigle Azur Extr√™me Orient Boeing 307 (F-BHHR) was blown off the runway and crashed at Tan Son Nhat International Airport while landing after the number four engine failed in flight; all 28 passengers and crew survived, but the aircraft was written off. The aircraft was operating a non-scheduled Saigon- Vientiane service.

He was best known for signing the first black player in the modern era of Major League Baseball (MLB), Jackie Robinson, after Robinson was scouted by Tom Greenwade in the Negro leagues. Eye injury impaired playing career Sukeforth was born in Washington, Maine. After two years at Georgetown University, followed by a year in the New England League with the Nashua Millionaires and the Manchester Blue Sox, he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds in . Sukeforth batted left-handed and threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and during his active career. He appeared in 486 games over all or parts of ten big-league seasons (1926‚Äì34 and 1945), compiling a batting average of .264 with 326 hits, two home runs and 96 runs batted in. His best year in the Major Leagues was , when he batted .354 for the Reds with 84 hits in 84 games played. Two years, later he lost partial sight of his right eye from being hit by a shotgun pellet while bird hunting on November 16. He was able to continue his playing career, but his batting suffered, and in Sukeforth was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers. In mid-1934, the Dodgers sent Sukeforth to the minor leagues, where he became a player-manager in 1936. Witnessed Robinson's historic signing Sukeforth managed in the Brooklyn farm system from 1937‚Äì42 with the Clinton Owls of the Class B Three-I League, the Elmira Pioneers of the Class A Eastern League and the Montreal Royals of the top-level International League before his promotion to the Dodger coaching staff in . He also was activated by Brooklyn at age 43 for 18 games during the first three months of the season, the last year of the World War II manpower shortage, despite not having played competitively since 1939, when he was a player-manager at Elmira. Sukeforth started 13 games as Brooklyn's catcher, and collected 15 hits, although only one was for extra bases, a double struck against Jim Tobin of the Boston Braves on April 24. He batted .288 in 55 at- bats. Sukeforth soon retired permanently from the playing ranks and resumed his former job as a Brooklyn coach and occasional special-assignment scout. In that capacity, later that season, he would make history. Dodger president Branch Rickey was making secret plans to break organized baseball's six- decades-long \\"gentleman's agreement\\" that enforced racial segregation. In August, Rickey sent Sukeforth to Chicago, where Robinson's team, the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, was slated to play the Chicago American Giants. Rickey told Sukeforth to urge Robinson to come back with him to Brooklyn for a meeting with Rickey and the Dodgers. Sukeforth met Robinson again in Toledo, Ohio, and the two men traveled by railway to Brooklyn for the historic meeting at the Dodgers' Montague Street offices on August 28. He was the only other person in the room when Rickey told Robinson of his plans to sign him to a contract to play in Montreal in . Then, in , Sukeforth‚Äîfunctioning in the unwanted role of interim manager of the Dodgers after the suspension of Leo Durocher‚Äîwrote Robinson's name into the Dodger lineup on Opening Day on April 15 against the Braves at Ebbets Field. In addition to serving on Durocher's coaching staff and his scouting assignments for Dodgers president Rickey, he worked behind the scenes in 1946 to help create the new Nashua Dodgers of the Class B New England League. Sukeforth helped the Nashua team forge ties with the New Hampshire community, easing the racial integration of the league when Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe were assigned to that club. Turned down two managerial opportunities Sukeforth won his only two games as the Dodgers' manager in 1947, 5‚Äì3 and 12‚Äì6, both against Boston. Durocher had been suspended for the entire 1947 season by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler because of \\"conduct detrimental to baseball.\\" But Sukeforth and a fellow coach, Ray Blades, both turned down the opportunity to serve as acting manager for the rest of the season; ultimately, Brooklyn scout and longtime Rickey associate Burt Shotton assumed that role, and Shotton led the Dodgers to the 1947 National League pennant. In , when Dodger manager Chuck Dressen needed a reliever to face the New York Giants' Bobby Thomson in the ninth inning of the decisive third game of the National League pennant playoff, Sukeforth, coaching in the Dodger bullpen, passed over Carl Erskine and sent in Ralph Branca, who gave up Thomson's \\"shot heard 'round the world\\".

Rickey, who was now general manager of the Pirates sent Sukeforth to Montreal to scout former major league pitcher Joe Black.

It was published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2007 in Japan and 2008 in western territories. The story follows Kaim, one of a select group of \\"immortals\\" who have lost their memories: while confronting threats generated by the world's approaching magical industrial revolution, he must also face the pain brought by his returning memories. The gameplay features many staples of the genre, such as navigation using a world map, random encounters, and a turn-based battle system. First discussions surrounding Lost Odyssey began in 2003, with development beginning the following year as an internal Microsoft project. After running into difficulties, Feelplus was established as a dedicated studio to work on the game. The story was written by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Japanese author Kiyoshi Shigematsu: Sakaguchi wanted to create a story focusing on evoking human emotions, and kept the gameplay within genre traditions so he could experiment with the story. The game went through a difficult development, with problems stemming from the chosen engine technology and the arrangement of development teams. The music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a veteran composer for the Final Fantasy series. First hinted at in 2005, the game was officially revealed shortly before that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. At the time it was released, it was Microsoft's largest console game, spanning four dual-layer DVDs. Upon its debut in Japan, it sold favourably, eventually selling nearly 110,000 units by April 2010. It also received strong sales overseas. Its critical reception has been generally positive: while praise has focused on its story, many journalists were critical of its traditional design and loading times.  Gameplay  A standard battle from Lost Odyssey, showing main protagonist Kaim performing an attack with the \\"Aim Ring System\\" active. Lost Odyssey uses a traditional turn-based battle system seen in most Japanese role-playing games, similar to early Final Fantasy iterations. A world map allows the player to move the party between adjacent towns or fields on the map, while later in the game the player is given more freedom to explore the world through the use of ocean- going ships. Towns and cities provide inns for the player to recover the party's health, stores for buying and selling of equipment, and save points for the game. While exploring certain areas, the player will randomly encounter monsters to fight. The combat system incorporates aspects of battle initiative and length of actions to determine how events resolve each turn. Item usage is instantaneous, regular melee attacks are executed on the same turn, while casting spells or using special abilities may delay the player's action for one or more turns, depending on their speed. Actions can be delayed if the user is hit by an attack. The player has the option to cancel an action on a subsequent turn if necessary. Melee attacks include an \\"Aim Ring System\\" using equippable rings with added effects. As the character launches the attack, two concentric targeting rings appear on screen. The player must time their button release in order to make the rings intersect. An accuracy rank (\\"Perfect\\", \\"Good\\" or \\"Bad\\") indicates the potency of the effect. These include additional damage specific to certain types of monsters or their magic element, hit point or mana absorption, status ailments, or being able to steal items. Even if awarded a \\"Perfect\\", a character can still miss the attack altogether. These rings are created by synthesizing \\"components\\", and can be upgraded into more accurate, or more potent versions; advanced rings can be made by combining two or more rings at a special vendor. In combat, both the player's party and enemies are arranged in two lines, front or back. Up to five party members can participate in battle at once. At the start of battle, the back line is protected by a special defensive \\"wall\\" which is based on the combined hit points of the front line. This wall reduces damage that the characters in the back experience. However, as the front line takes damage, the wall weakens, and can only be recovered through the use of certain spells or skills. There are two types of characters that the player controls. \\"Mortals\\" gain skills by leveling up, but can benefit from additional skills by equipping accessories. \\"Immortals\\" do not know any skills initially, but instead gain skills by \\"linking\\" with a mortal character that is currently part of the battle formation, earning skill points in battle towards complete learning of the skill. Immortals can also learn skills from accessories by equipping them in the same manner, much like the ability point system of Final Fantasy IX. Once a skill is learned, the player can then assign these skills to a limited number of skill slots, initially starting at three but able to be expanded via \\"Slot Seed\\" items or certain skills. Immortals also have the ability to automatically revive in battle should they lose all their hit points; however, if the entire party is downed, including the immortals, the game will be over. The game's magic system is based on four classes of magic: Black, consisting primarily of elemental attacks and negative status effects; White, mainly for healing and protection; Spirit, for stat changes, status ailments and non-elemental magic; and Composite, which can combine two spells, once learned, into multi-target or multi-function spells. To cast spells, the player must first find spells to fill the spell book, and then must have characters that have learned the appropriate magic skill of the right level to cast that spell.  Synopsis = Setting  Lost Odyssey is set in a world in which a \\"Magic-Industrial Revolution\\" is taking place. While magic energy existed in all living creatures beforehand, it suddenly became far more powerful thirty years before the beginning of the game. Because of this, it has affected society greatly, with devices called \\"Magic Engines\\" harnessing this power for lighting, automobiles, communication, and robots, among other uses. While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction: the kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.  Plot  After a meteor wipes out the majority of forces from the nations of Uhra and Khent, Kaim joins Seth and Jansen to investigate the Grand Staff at the behest of the council of Uhra. At the Staff, the three are captured by hostile scouts who take them to Numara, where they meet with Queen Ming, another immortal who has lost her memory. The queen allows the group to go free in Numara, where Kaim meets Cooke and Mack, his grandchildren, who join the group after the death of their mother. News eventually arrives in Numara that Gongora has encouraged Tolten to reestablish the monarchy in Uhra and prepare for war. The general of Numara, Kakanas, uses the opportunity to usurp control of the country from Ming, forcing her to flee with Kaim and others as enemies of the state. The group travels towards the nation of Gohtza, hoping to seek help from its King. On the way, Sarah Sisulart, Kaim's wife, joins the party after she is recovered from the Old Sorceress Mansion. Arriving in Gohtza, Kaim and Sarah arrange for a peace negotiation between the Gohtzan King, Queen Ming, and Tolten to take place on a train. However, Kaim and Sarah are forced to go after Cooke and Mack, who steal a train to again try to find the spirit of their departed mother, leaving Jansen and Seth to participate in the negotiation alone. During the meeting, Gongora activates Grand Staff and flash freezes the entire country. Kaim and Sarah locate Cooke and Mack but are forced to separate due to a vicious magic attack by Gongora. Kaim and Sarah's train crashes, while Cooke and Mack are stranded on the train tracks in the freezing cold. The children are later saved by Ming and Jansen. The four unite and rescue Kaim and Sarah. In Uhra, Tolten learns that Gongora has announced Tolten's death and has usurped the throne, thus he joins with Seth to help free her son Sed, who joins the party, and his pirate hydrofoil submarine, the Nautilus. The entire party reconvenes in Gohtza. The immortals talk and begin to recover their memories, realizing that they are actually observers from a parallel universe. In Gongora's diary, he explains the difference in space- time, where 1000 years is equivalent to 1 year in the parallel universe. The diary also explains that the immortals' world has been affected by the emotions of people in the mortal realm. After regaining their memories, the party heads for Grand Staff. They recognize that Gongora is attempting to use the Grand Staff to destroy the portal between the two worlds, killing the other immortals and making himself effectively invincible. The group confronts Gongora in the Hall of Mirrors, the only place where they are vulnerable to death. The mortals help to block the mirror's power while the immortals fight Gongora, but their powers are equally matched. When the mortals become trapped in their own barrier after absorbing too much power, Seth drags Gongora through the mirror, allowing Kaim to break it and prevent him from ever returning. In the epilogue, the nations led by Ming and Tolten come together to rebuild society, and the monarchy is restored in Uhra. Ming and Jansen get married, while Kaim and Sarah settle down to help raise Cooke and Mack, all aware that Seth is able to observe their happy endings.  Development  Scenario writer and project supervisor Hironobu Sakaguchi at the 2006 Tokyo Game Show. The development of Lost Odyssey was first proposed to Microsoft Game Studios by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The first discussions began in 2003. It was a collaboration between Mistwalker, an independent game studio set up by Sakaguchi in 2004, and Microsoft. It was initially an internal project by Microsoft with Sakaguchi, but development ran into difficulties. Faced with critical problems, Microsoft decided to found a dedicated studio to help with development: this became Feelplus, which formed one part of AQ Interactive. The staff of feelplus included a large number of developers from the defunct Shadow Hearts developer Nautilus, and staff members from The Legend of Dragoon and Phantom Dust. Among the shared staff were art director Takamasa Ohsawa. They also included developers from Microsoft and Sega. Further freelance staff were also brought in. Development started in 2004 and lasted three and a half years. Mistwalker handled the story and character design, Feelplus developed the actual product, while Microsoft provided funding, project management and testing. While development started with ten people, at development's peak it was at 150. The game's respective director and technical director, Daisuke Fukugawa and Katsuhisa Higuchi, had previously worked at Square Enix. Sakaguchi was fairly closely involved during the initial development, but during later phases he took a more hands-off supervisory approach. The game's story was written by Sakaguchi, whose main aim was to create a highly emotional experience that explored the human psyche. According to him, the game's setting revolved around conflict and its effects. In addition to Sakaguchi's work, Japanese novelist Kiyoshi Shigematsu created over thirty stories detailing Kaim's life as an immortal, titled \\"A Thousand Years of Dreams\\". According to Shigematsu, it was the first time he had ever worked on a video game, and was unsure about whether he could evoke emotion as he did in his books. In the end, he found that the interactive medium gave his work a new impact that moved him to tears upon seeing it in place. These story segments were presented in the game in a similar style to a visual novel, as the stories were intended to evoke emotion. The gameplay, such as the battle system, was kept deliberately traditional so that Sakaguchi had freedom to experiment with the story. Despite this, he wanted to introduce new real-time elements into the system. One of the elements Sakaguchi checked was how story and gameplay were balanced: sometimes, he would ask for a cutscene to be removed or for a boss battle to be lengthened if the balance seemed off. The music was composed and produced by Nobuo Uematsu at his studio Smile Please, a composer famous for his work on the Final Fantasy series. Arrangements were done by Satoshi Henmi and Hiroyuki Nakayama. Uematsu was contracted to Mistwalker to work on three of their games, with the first being Blue Dragon. He was highly excited for the title as it was Sakaguchi's first \\"serious\\" game since leaving Square Enix in 2003. As he was involved with Lost Odyssey from the early stages, receiving information on the characters and setting, he was able to create his first musical pieces while the game was in early stages. Most of the two hours worth of music was recorded with a live orchestra, as Uematsu felt that the emotion evoked by the game could only be communicated through live instruments. As with his previous work, Uematsu's music covered a lot of ground: the musical style varied from grand orchestral pieces, to hardcore rock, to ambient electronic music. In addition, he used unusual ethnic instruments to introduce unconventional sounds, including a sitar and a shakuhachi. The main theme was written in a minor key to express the burden of living for over a millennium: it was incorporated into the score in various forms. Two of the songs in the game, \\"What You Are\\" and \\"Eclipse of Time\\", were sung by award-winning vocalist Sheena Easton. The vocal track \\"Kaette Kuru, Kitto...\\" was sung by Japanese band Flip Flap. The lyrics for all the songs were written by Sakaguchi.  Design  For the development, the staff split up into multiple teams that handled different segments of game development: one group was responsible for the game's build, another was responsible for the database system and AI, while another was in charge of level design. The game design went smoothly as the game's staff were used to the genre, but other aspects did not: development began without access to the Xbox 360 hardware, and starting development with a large staff caused aspects to be changed upon the console's release. The three separate teams that created battle, adventure, and cutscene components ran into \\"various issues\\" while combining their work, causing company president Ray Nakazato to consider \\"seamless\\" development for any later projects. Little-used parts of the environment were given an extensive level of detail, resulting in a waste of money and time, and concept art was given the same extensive level of attention. Microsoft's milestone- based development schedule was seen as a boon to the development, as every three months the team needed to produce acceptable results for Microsoft. Conversely, the high number of staff led to a prolonged feeling of disconnection between developers. According to Sakaguchi, the team was on the point of collapse by the middle of development, but they pulled through. The game used Unreal Engine 3 as middleware due to it being at the forefront of engine technology at the time. It also allowed development to start before the console's release. Conversely, the design philosophy behind Unreal Engine clashed with the philosophies most often used in JRPG engines, resulting in difficulties with integration that repeated themselves four times during development. In addition, the team had trouble keeping up with the engine's regular updates and reading the requisite manuals. This in turn caused technical setbacks such as long loading times. Four different types of cutscenes were created, from lower-quality real-time cutscenes to pre-rendered cinematics. In hindsight, it was felt that the pre-rendered cinematics were not needed as they used the same models as the high-quality real-time cutscenes, although during development pre-rendered cutscenes were chosen due to their improved lighting and visual effects. The different grades of cutscenes were created differently: higher-quality real-time cutscenes were first shot and then tailored motion capture animations were included with hand-manipulated facial expressions, while the lower-quality cutscenes used \\"off-the-shelf\\" motion capture. Due to a lack of a clear transition point, players later felt that cutscene quality was inconsistent. The amount of higher-quality cutscenes was much higher in earlier builds of the game, and the team needed to reduce their number and replace them with standard real- time cutscenes. The final length of cutscenes was estimated at around seven hours: one hour used pre-rendered graphics despite real-time high-quality character models being used, while six hours were purely real-time. The game's visual director was Roy Sato, who had a previous background in film and television and had worked with Sakaguchi on Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Working on the game was initially difficult, as he needed to adjust to a new format and get used to a company that was still fairly new. The main characters were designed by Takehiko Inoue, a noted manga artist who had developed a reputation for designing \\"people\\". Inoue made the initial character designs based on the material provided by Sakaguchi, then submitted them and adjusted them based on Sakaguchi's feedback. Characters sometimes needed to be completely redesigned, such as Tolten. The main characters' clothing was designed by Final Fantasy artist Hideo Minaba: the clothing was designed not to reflect any nationality or historical era. While they tried not to limit the designers' creative abilities within the game's hardware, Minaba was asked to limit fluffy or swinging clothing. The character models were hard to create, especially considering the surrounding environments. In contrast, the use of Unreal Engine 3 lessened the technical restrictions on the team. Inoue ran frequent checks on the character models as they went through multiple revisions, even down to their eyebrows. It was estimated that three hundred unique characters were created for the game. The game's concept artwork was worked on by Christian Lorenz Scheurer, who had previous worked on Final Fantasy IX, along with film projects such as The Fifth Element.  Release  Mistwalker confirmed in February 2005 that it was working on two RPGs for the then-untitled Xbox 360. Lost Odyssey was officially revealed during a pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The game's content was large enough that it was shipped on four dual-layer DVD discs: this was one more than Mistwalker's other Xbox 360 RPG Blue Dragon, and at the time made it Microsoft's largest console game. A demo for Japan was released in 2006, featuring a basic build of its battle system. In hindsight, a demo release this early was seen as a mistake as it gave players a negative impression of the battle system. Microsoft initially had high hopes for the title and so had high sales forecasts, but after the Xbox 360 met with poor sales in Japan, they significantly reduced their forecast. Lost Odyssey was added to the Xbox One backwards compatibility list in September 2016. The game was made available digitally on December 14, 2016 and was a free download to all Xbox Live members until December 31.https://majornelson.com/2016/12/14/lost-odyssey-and-blue-dragon-are-now- available-digitally-lost-odyssey-free-for-limited- time/?linkId=32388564#comments  Localization  The game was localized into multiple languages, but all the lip syncing was for the English dialogue: this was done partly to show western audiences appreciation for their support of the title, and also because Japanese audiences had grown used to out-of- sync dialogue with dubbed Western films. English voice recording was done in Los Angeles. Localization was handled by Microsoft: initially, different departments in each region handled localization for their region. The need to translate and then include the material at long distance proved problematic, so the main development team brought the localization team into the main production, introducing them to easy-to-use development tools so changes could be made easily without direct consultation with Feelplus. The story segments written by Shigematsu were translated by Jay Rubin, a noted American academic and translator from Harvard University noted for translating the works of Haruki Murakami. Microsoft chose Rubin as they wanted Shigematsu's material treated and translated with the utmost respect possible. When first approached, Rubin was skeptical, as he did not want to work in a medium that generally seemed to glorify violence. However, he eventually agreed to have a look at the material, and was shocked by the anti-violence message present throughout all the stories while remaining family-friendly. He referred to the messages within Shigematsu's stories as \\"essentially Buddhistic\\", and was surprised that Microsoft had contacted him in the first place given the stories' visual novel medium within the context of Lost Odyssey.  Downloadable content  Downloadable content (DLC) for the game began release in Japan in January 2010: the content consisted of multiple additional chapters in \\"A Thousand Years of Dreams\\", powerful accessories, and an option to view cutscenes. The final DLC package included a late-game underwater dungeon. The DLC content received overseas releases between April and May 2008, but the first one was limited to a pre-order exclusive in North America.  Novel  On November 21, 2007 a book of short stories based on the main character of Kaim was released in Japan called . It is penned by Kiyoshi Shigematsu and features 31 out of the 33 stories found in the \\"A Thousand Years of Dreams\\" sequences throughout the game itself.  Reception = Sales  Lost Odyssey reportedly sold 40,000 copies in Japan on its first day at retail, around 50% of the shipment. As of February 17, 2008, the game has sold 104,417 copies in Japan according to Famitsu numbers. Its sales figures impressed Microsoft enough that they were considering turning Lost Odyssey into a series. As of April 2010, the game has sold 109,517 units in Japan, becoming the ninth best-selling game for the platform. The game has done much better in the West; according to NPD numbers Lost Odyssey debuted at #7, selling 203,000 in its debut month of February in North America. At its UK debut, it debuted at #6 in the gaming charts.  Reviews  Famitsu awarded the game a score of 36/40, with all four critics each giving the game a 9. According to Metacritic, the game received \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" The issue many took with Lost Odyssey was its deliberately old-school gameplay mechanics, particularly the traditional combat system, which several critics found to be dull and dated, as well as the game's use of random battles, which were further deemed an issue by their purportedly lengthy load times. Xbox Focus gave the game a 4/5 rating, declaring its story as profound, but taking an issue with the camera control and the odd character design. Unlike other critics, however, Xbox Focus's Alex Yusupov deemed the combat and random battles as exhilarating, and that \\"it's better to take a tried and true technique and make it better than introduce a completely new idea that could possibly screw up an entire game.\\" IGN found that the ring-building system, immortals, and skill system added a fresh feel to the game's otherwise traditional combat, and 1UP.com praised the \\"timed button press\\" aspect of the battles, saying it makes them \\"more engaging than you'd think.\\" While the visual novel flashback sequences, penned by Kiyoshi Shigematsu, were widely acclaimed, critics were divided on the main story itself. RPGFan stated that the story and gameplay were both \\"overused, uninspired, and stilted\\", but that the memory sequences penned by Shigematsu were \\"some of the richest, most emotionally charged storytelling seen in any RPG to date\\". GameSpot praised Lost Odysseys \\"fascinating cast,\\" character development, and \\"great plot,\\" and also called the combat system \\"solid.\\" The reviewer also described the flashbacks as \\"well written and emotionally gripping.\\" GameSpy, called the main plot and characters, \\"shamelessly derivative.\\" GamePro magazine agreed, declaring that the main story was not particularly compelling, although it noted that many subplots carried plenty of emotional weight. On the other hand, Game Informer magazine deemed the story line as being \\"one of the most compelling tales ever told on the Xbox 360,\\" and praised the \\"cool combat system.\\" GameTrailers said, \\"what sets Lost Odyssey apart is a deeply moving story that places an emotional focal point on its characters.\\" Despite critics' differing opinions in other areas, the game's graphics and high production values have received acclaim, although load times and framerate issues were also pointed out. However, it transpired that the copy that some reviewers received apparently had longer loading times than those of the retail version. GameSpot amended their review on February 19, 2008 to reflect this, but did not change their original score.

It remained under the Kingdom of Poland between 1765 and 1831. In 1831 it was incorporated under the Russian Empire until the Russian revolution (191)7. Today, there are two recognised orders that claim descent from the original Order of Saint Stanislaus: the Russian dynastic Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov), awarded by the head of the House of Romanov as former sovereigns of the Russian Empire, and the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta, a governmental order of merit awarded by the President of Poland and considered by some as a type of successor. History Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski, King of Poland, founder of the Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr on 7 May 1765. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, King of Poland, established the Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr on 8 May 1765 Initially, the order was limited to 100 members who were required to prove four generations of nobility. The knights were required to pay for donations to poor people and to adhere to various rules of chivalry. Due to the rising influence of the Russian Empire on Central European affairs, the rules of awarding of the order were broken. After the Partitions of Poland, the order was resurrected in the Duchy of Warsaw, bestowing upon its recipients the title of hereditary nobility and requiring donations to a Warsaw hospital. Since 1815 in the Polish (Congress) Kingdom, the order, originally in a single class, was retained and divided into four classes. Russian Empire On 25 January 1831, the Polish Parliament deposed Emperor Nicholas I of Russia from the throne of Poland, while he was also Grand Master (order) of the Order of Saint Stanislaus. Yet, after the downfall of the November Uprising the Imperial House of Romanov established the Royal and Imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus, incorporating it into the honours system of the Russian Empire in 1832, where it remained officially until the Russian Revolution 1917. The order was abolished with the fall of the Romanovs in 1917 but, unlike other Polish orders awarded by the Tsars, the Order of Saint Stanislaus was not revived by the newly independent Second Polish Republic (possibly because in its Russian form it was often awarded by the imperial government to those Poles who co-operated with Russia rule making the order a symbol of subservience to an occupying power). Instead, the newly founded Order of Polonia Restituta was created as an attributed Polish successor to the order. Insignia Both the Polish and Russian badges hung from a red ribbon with white strips near its borders (i.e., the colors of the Polish coat of arms and flag), a ribbon which they share with the modern Order of Polonia Restituta. The order also had an eight-pointed star with straight rays with a central medallion bearing the letters \\"SS\\" surrounded by the Latin words \\"Praemiando incitat\\", which is in turn surrounded by a laurel wreath. The star has essentially the same design in both its Polish and Russian forms. Polish The original Polish badge of the order was a red enameled Maltese cross with white enameled Polish eagles between its arms and with a central medallion bearing an enameled image of Saint Stanislaus in his episcopal vestment surrounded by a gold laurel wreath. In its original Polish form the knights of the Order wore a red, white and silver habit modelled on the traditional dress of a Polish nobleman (i.e., zupan, kontusz, pas kontuszowy and delia). Russian In the Russian version of the badge, the Polish white eagles were replaced with gold Russian double-headed imperial eagles, their wings partially overlapping the arms of the cross and the central medallion bearing the letters \\"SS\\" in red on a white enamel background instead of the original image of the saintly bishop, surrounded by a green enamel laural wreath. There is also a semi-circle of gold rays between each of the points of arms of the Maltese cross. Legacy Today, there are two main competing claims to the represent the Order of Saint Stanislaus: the Russian Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov), awarded by the head of the House of Romanov, and the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta, a governmental order of merit awarded by the President of Poland and considered by some as a type of successor. Two other organisations in Poland, the Ordo Sancti Stanislai and the International Order of Saint Stanislaus, contemporarily describe themselves as merely private charitable organisations.

In the game, players control Stooges Moe, Larry and Curly in minigames based on classic Stooges films with the aim of raising enough money to save an orphanage. The game was later ported for different systems including the Apple IIGS, Commodore 64, NES and Game Boy Advance. A remake of the game was also released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh. While the game has been praised as a faithful adaptation of the Stooges films, it has been criticized for repetitive gameplay and limited replay value. Gameplay Players must select a minigame to complete for each in-game day. Game designer John Cutter designed the game as a kind of board game. The Three Stooges must rescue an old woman's orphanage by earning money in minigames based on various Three Stooges films. These include cracker-eating contests (based on the Stooges short Dutiful But Dumb) and boxing matches (based on the short Punch Drunks). Players select minigames by timing a button press as a hand randomly points to various symbols representing in-game events, including non-interactive events that can raise or lower the Stooges' cash total. Each event takes up one in- game day; players have 30 in-game days to earn as much money as possible.\\"The Three Stooges.\\" Your Amiga. Aug‚ÄìSep 1988. pp 24-25. The hand gradually speeds up from one day to the next, but can be slowed down by landing on a space that allows Moe to pummel Larry and Curly. The player must avoid mousetrap spaces, which injure the fingers on the hand; landing on four such spaces immediately ends the game, regardless of the number of days completed. Several different game endings are possible, depending on the amount of money the player has earned. These range from the banker foreclosing on the orphanage due to the Stooges' inability to collect enough money to pay the rent, to the orphanage being saved and renovated and the Stooges marrying the owner's three daughters. The game included a fair amount of humor ‚Äì the game itself loads initially as Defender of the Crown (another Cinemaware title) with a splash screen and music. The game version of the Stooges walk onto the screen, the music screeches to a halt, a Larry soundbite exclaims \\"Hey, this looks like a kid's game!\\", Moe replies \\"You idiots!\\", and follows up with a smacking noise and Curly yelling, \\"OH!\\". The NES port, made by Activision, used a slightly edited version of the Ghostbusters title screen instead, in order to promote Ghostbusters II, and included an extra soundbite of Curly saying \\"Hey, fellas! We're in the wrong game!\\". The 2002 port by Crawfish Interactive kept the Defender of the Crown opening, only this time having Moe yell \\"You idiots! We're in the wrong game!\\", then having the Stooges walk along a country road with billboards advertising Crawfish, as well as the now-defunct Cinemaware and the then-upcoming game Wings. Ports and related releases The game was later ported to the NES, developed by Beam Software and published by Activision.Compute! Gazette. December 1988. Issue 66, Vol. 6, No. 12 Cinemaware directly released a port for the Apple IIGS in 1990. Versions for the Game Boy Advance (developed by Crawfish Interactive) and PlayStation (developed by Flying Tiger) were published by Metro3D, Inc. and released in 2002. The game was also updated for release on Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh as one of Cinemaware's \\"Digitally Remastered\\" editions. A port was completed for the Game Boy Color, however it was cancelled in 2000 and only footage of the beta has been released. Reception The Amiga version of the game received mixed reviews, with the game's graphics and digital voices receiving most of the praise. Mark Patterson of Commodore User gave the game an 8 out of 10, citing positive impressions of the game's humor, writing that the game was \\"probably the only game that has intentionally set out to make people laugh, and worked.\\"The Three Stooges Review.

Retrieved on May 5, 2009. History The land that Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown now occupies was, in the early 1980s, home to a theme park known as Hanna-Barbera Land. Hanna-Barbera Land only operated for two seasons before its owners, Kings Entertainment Company, sold the park to private investors. The amusement park had all its rides removed, with the new owners installing a water park with several water slides. Much of the park's Victorian buildings, street lights and landscaping remained. Splashtown USA opened to the public shortly after. In the 1990s, the park changed owners twice: first to the Morris Family in 1994, and then to Six Flags in May 1999. The acquisition was made by Six Flags to eliminate the park from being a competitor to its Six Flags WaterWorld water park, also located in Houston. The park was renamed Six Flags SplashTown in 2000. Following the closure of Six Flags WaterWorld and the adjacent Six Flags AstroWorld in October 2005, Six Flags engaged in a restructuring of Six Flags SplashTown, which resulted in the termination of the park's General Manager, Operations Manager and Food Service Manager in early November 2005. In January 2006, it was announced that the former Operations Manager of WaterWorld would be the new Splashtown Operations Manager. Several of WaterWorld's attractions were relocated to SplashTown. The park underwent a \\"facelift\\" as well as general cleaning to prepare it for its opening day, April 28, 2006. The entrance received a new sign, with the addition of renovated buildings and ticket booths. In January 2007, Six Flags announced that SplashTown, along with six other parks, would be sold for a total of $312 million. The agreement saw Six Flags sell the properties to PARC Management, who in turn sold the properties to CNL Lifestyle Properties. CNL would then lease the properties back to PARC Management under a 52-year triple-net lease. However, after less than three years into the 52-year contracts, CNL terminated their agreements with PARC Management in November 2010. In early 2011, CNL appointed Premier Attractions Management, LLC (now Premier Parks, LLC) as the new operators of the park. At the time, the limited liability company was led by former Six Flags employees Kieran Burke, the former chairman and CEO, and Gary Story, the former president and chief operating officer. In November 2013, CNL Lifestyle Properties acquired rights to the Wet'n'Wild brand in the United States from Australian firm, Village Roadshow Theme Parks. In the months to follow CNL rebranded several of its properties to Wet'n'Wild water parks, including SplashTown Houston, which became Wet'n'Wild SplashTown. The park itself received a multimillion-dollar renovation.Alexander, Heather. \\"Houston waterpark to reopen with millions in renovations and new name\\" Houston Chronicle April 30, 2014. Retrieved on May 12, 2014. In late 2016, CNL Lifestyle Properties announced that it was selling ownership of fifteen attraction properties, including Wet'n'Wild Splashtown, along with five small family entertainment centers to EPR Properties for approximately $456 million. The transaction was completed in April 2017. Premier Parks LLC remained as the operator. On May 22, 2018, Six Flags acquired the leasing rights from Premier Parks LLC to manage several parks owned by EPR Properties. Splashtown was renovated in the offseason and in 2019 changed its name to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown. Due to the growing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, Six Flags announced a suspension of operations across the company on March 13, 2020. Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown was scheduled to open for the 2020 season on May 22, but released a new opening date of June 29. On June 26, three days prior to the new opening date, the water park announced that its reopening was delayed indefinitely in order to follow local county government guidelines. In early August, park officials announced that the 2020 operating season had been canceled and that Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown looks forward to open again in 2021. This would be the first season for the water park to not operate since its inception in 1984.

The river's headwaters are on the western slope of the Western Ghats range, and it flows west into the Arabian Sea. The river flows through Maharashtra and Gujarat states, as well as the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. The industrial towns of Vapi, Dadra and Silvassa lie on the north bank of the river, and the town of Daman occupies both banks of the river's estuary. The major development project on the river is the Daman Ganga Multipurpose project completed which benefits the state of Gujarat and the Union Territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. In 2015, a major river interlinking project involving inter-basin transfer of surplus water from the Daman Ganga called the \\"Daman Ganga-Pinjal River Linking Project\\" has been approved for implementation. The two historical forts on either side of the river at Daman, are the Moti Daman ('Moti' means \\"big\\") on the southern bank and the Nani Daman ('Nani' means \\"small\\"), on the northern bank. Geography Nani Daman fort on the Daman Ganga at Daman The Daman Ganga, also known as Dawan River, rises in the Sahyadri hills close to Ambegaon village in Dindori taluka of Nasik district of Maharashtra State. It raise at an elevation of 950m. The major tributaries of Daman and Vag run a course of and respectively before joining at Matunji to become the Daman Ganga River. Major part of the river lies in Maharashtra. Its total length from source to the Arabian Sea is . Some of major tributaries which originate and flow through the mountainous region of the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu are Dawan, Shrimant, Val, Rayate, Lendi, Wagh, Sakartond, Roshni, Dudhni, and Piperiya. As the river joins the sea at Daman, it is named Daman Ganga. At the estuary there is heavy sedimentation and hence the depth of water is shallow. Daman is located on both banks of the river (Portuguese name: Rio Sandalcalo). At the mouth of the river the bar is level bed made of hard sand, except for the North of the North point where the river enters the sea. The river basin (part of the basin of West flowing rivers from Tapi to Tadri), which lies entirely on the western ghats, has a total catchment area of . Catchment area distribution is: In the Nashik district of Maharashtra (60.74%); in the Valsad district in Gujarat (21.36%); and in the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu it is (17.90%). The mean annual run off from the catchment is 3,771 MCM (million cubic metres). The upstream area of the river is hilly and covered with forest . Rain fall occurs during the monsoon months from June to September with an annual average rainfall incidence of approximately (maximum recorded is reported to be .}. The soil conditions in the basin are categorized as \\"reddish brown soil, coarse shallow soil, deep black soil and Coastal alluvial soil\\". Silvassa, Vapi and Daman are the major towns on the banks of the river. The places of tourist interest on the Daman Ganga River in Dadra and Nagar Haveli are Van Ganga and Vandhara Garden. There are also two historical forts on either side of the river at Daman, which face each other, known as Moti Daman on the southern bank, the larger of the two and the Nani Daman, smaller in size, on the northern bank.  Development =Damanganga Reservoir Project There is an existing major irrigation project on the river called the Damanganga Reservoir Project, which is located near Madhuban village in Dharampur taluka of Valsad district of Gujarat. It is an inter-state multipurpose project of the Govt. of Gujarat and Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (DNHDD). The storage of this project is shared by the riparian state of Gujarat and Union Territory of DNHDD as the beneficiary region. The total volume of water to be shared is 516.63 MCM (million cubic metres) (420.50 MCM for irrigation and the balance 96.13 MCM for other uses, which is allotted to the riparian state and Union Territories; Gujarat has a share of 399.19 MCM, Dadra and Nagar Haveli's share is 83.33 MCM and of Daman is 34.20 MCM. The project was built from 1972 to 1998. It is a composite dam of masonry and earth-fill dams. The masonry dam of 58.6 m height with a spillway in the gorge section of the river of 350 m length; the spillway, with an ogee shape and a roller bucket for energy dissipation, is designed to rout a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge of 25,850 cumecs (cubic meters per second) controlled by 10 radial gates each of size . It has earth dams on both its flanks which measures . The composite dam is founded in area with geological formations of amygdaloidal basalt, porphyritic basalt, dolerite, and agglomerate. At the Full Reservoir level the reservoir water spread is which includes 987 ha of waste land and of agricultural land. Submergence also involved 12 villages completely and 24 villages partially. The Gross Command Area (GCA)is and the Cultural Command Area (CCA) of irrigation is on the left and right bank canals network benefiting the states of Gujarat, Dadra & Nager Haveli and Daman. Total length of the canals is with a design discharge of per second in the right bank canal and per second on the left bank canal. Irrigation covers 112 villages in Valsad district, 26 villages in Daman, and 24 villages in Dadra Nagar Haveli. The Project provides 58 million gallons per day for industrial and domestic water needs and also has a small power plant of 2 MW capacity. The cost of the project was shared between the participating states as per the Inter-State Agreement of 1992. The river supplies potable drinking water to Vapi town, industries around the town and 11 villages in Daman from the head works located on the pick up weir on Daman Ganga River. Daman Ganga-Pinjal River Linking Project The Government of India's National Water Development Authority (NWDA) has proposed the Daman Ganga-Pinjal River Linking Project linking the Daman Ganga River to the Pinjal reservoir on the Pinjal River to the south, in the Vaitarna basin allowing surplus water from the Daman Ganga to be diverted south to Mumbai via the Pinjal reservoir. The feasibility report was prepared by NWDA in 2004, and in 2010 a tripartite agreement was signed between the Central government and the two state governments of Gujarat and Maharashtra. In January 2015, the project was approved for implementation. Under this project the two reservoirs to be created by building dams are the Bhugad dam on Damanganga River in Gujarat and the Khargihill dam on the Vagh River near Behapada village in Thane in Maharashtra. The reservoirs will be linked by a pressure tunnel of and . The Bhugad-Khargihill and Khargihill- Pinjal tunnel which is totally in the Maharashtra state is a long and diameter tunnel and will transfer the surplus waters to the extent of 909 MCM annually to Mumbai City to supplement the present domestic and industrial water supply system, from the Pinjal reservoir to Greater Mumbai; this part of the project is to be implemented as per plans evolved by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The dam on the Daman Ganga at Bhugad will be a composite dam of in height and long, to create a gross storage of 426.39 MCM and a live storage of 400.00 MCM. The composite dam on Vagh River at Khargihill is proposed to a maximum height of and in length with have gross storage capacity of 460.79 MCM and live storage of 420.50 MCM. The Pinjal dam on the Pinjal River shall be long and will have gross storage of 413.57 MCM and live storage of 401.55 MCM. The annual water diversion to greater Mumbai will be per second. The implementation of the entire project is planned to be completed over a nine- year period. River pollution The Damanganga River downstream of Vapi up to its confluence with the sea is polluted from the effluents emerging from the industrial and domestic wastes of the Vapi town, Silvassa, Daman and Kachigaon. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's report the BOD value recorded at its monitoring station downstream of Kachogaon was a high of 30 mgl per liter. According to a study report of the Machhimar Adhikar Rahstriya Abhiyan due to the industrial effluents from the Vapi town the dissolved oxygen level is very low ar 0.1-mg/1 and Mercury content in the groundwater in the town is about ninety six times higher than the standards prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Untreated effluents are directly discharged into the Damanganga and Kolak Rivers. This has resulted in pollution of the sea water to a limit of five nautical miles seriously affecting fish life. The Common Effluent Treatment was also reported to be dis-functional with about 1000 small-scale and artisanal fishers in four to five villages getting affected on account of the Sarigam Industrial Association's effluent disposal pipeline.

According to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, piti is a stimulating, exciting and energizing quality, as opposed to the calmness of sukha.Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (Author), Santikaro Bhikkhu (Translator). Mindfulness With Breathing : A Manual for Serious Beginners. 1988, p. 69 Piti is a joyful samskara (formation) associated with no object so the practitioner is not attaining it by desire. It is often translated with the English word \\"rapture\\" and is distinguished from the longer-lasting meditative \\"joy\\" or \\"happiness\\" (Pali, Sanskrit: sukha) which is a subtler feeling that arises along with pƒ´ti. Absorption factor In Buddhist meditation, the development of concentrative absorption (Sanskrit: dhyƒÅna; Pali: jhƒÅna) is canonically described in terms of the following five factors: * directed thought (vitakka) * pondering (vicƒÅra) * physical pleasure (pƒ´ti) * happiness/joy/bliss (sukha) * equanimity (upekkhƒÅ)See, for instance, SamƒÅdhaga Sutta (a/k/a, Pa√±cagikasamƒÅdhi Sutta, AN 5.28) (Thanissaro, 1997). Both pƒ´ti and sukha are born of seclusion from the five hindrances and mental quietude. The 5th century CE Visuddhimagga distinguishes between pƒ´ti and sukha in the following experiential manner: :And wherever the two are associated, happiness [here, √ëƒÅamoli's translation of pƒ´ti] is the contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss [sukha] is the actual experiencing of it when got. Where there is happiness [pƒ´ti] there is bliss (pleasure) [sukha]; but where there is bliss [sukha] there is not necessarily happiness [pƒ´ti]. Happiness is included in the formations aggregate; bliss is included in the feeling aggregate. If a man exhausted in a desert saw or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood, he would have happiness; if he went into the wood's shade and used the water, he would have bliss....Vsm. IV, 100 (√ëƒÅamoli, 1999, p. 142). Similarly, see also the Abhidhamma's commentary, Atthasalini (Bodhi, 1980). Fivefold classification As the meditator experiences tranquillity (samatha), one of five kinds of physical pleasure (piti) will arise. These are: *Weak rapture only causes piloerection. *Short rapture evocates some thunder \\"from time to time\\". *Going down rapture explodes inside the body, like waves. *Exalting rapture \\"makes the body jump to the sky\\". *Fulfilling rapture seems to be a huge flood of a mountain stream. Note only the last two are considered specifically piti. The first four are just a preparation for the last one, which is the jhanic factor.Vsm. IV, 94-99 (√ëƒÅamoli, 1999, pp. 141-2).

Thompson was born in Centreville, Alabama. In 1916, his family moved to New York City, where Thompson attended George Washington High School and Columbia University. At Columbia, he was a football teammate of Lou Gehrig's, but Thompson left the school to turn professional before he could join Gehrig on the Lions' baseball team.United Press International, Fresco Thompson obituary, November 21, 1968 Playing career A right-handed batter and thrower, Thompson stood tall and weighed . His pro career began at the Class D level of the minors in 1923. After three years of seasoning, he made his debut in September with the eventual world champion Pittsburgh Pirates. Following brief appearances with the Pirates (14 games in 1925) and New York Giants (two games in ), Thompson was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in when the Giants obtained Rogers Hornsby. He had his most productive years with the Phils, playing in Baker Bowl, twice hitting over .300. Overall, he batted .298 in 669 games played with 762 hits in 2,560 at bats with 13 home runs and 249 RBI for four teams over nine National League seasons (1925‚Äì32; 1934). He finished his career with a .962 fielding percentage. Dodger executive After his playing days, Thompson managed in the minor leagues and in , he became an assistant farm system director for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Thompson moved up the executive ladder, and survived the front-office purge that followed Branch Rickey's departure in October . During the shakeup, Thompson became a vice president and the team's second-ranking baseball executive, responsible for all minor league operations, while another VP, Buzzie Bavasi, assumed control of the big-league Dodgers' operations. Thompson continued in that role after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in . When Bavasi left to become president of the expansion San Diego Padres on June 4, 1968, Thompson became the Dodgers' executive vice president and general manager. During the transition, he presided over the Dodgers' hugely successful 1968 amateur draft. The regular and secondary phases of the 1968 June lottery netted the Dodgers Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Ron Cey, Bill Buckner, Bobby Valentine, Joe Ferguson, Doyle Alexander and others. However, a few weeks later, Thompson was diagnosed with cancer, and he died in November in Fullerton, California, at the age of 66.Collier, Phil, \\"Death of a Dodger\\", Baseball Digest, February 1969, pp. 27-28 He was succeeded as general manager by the club's scouting director, Al Campanis.

It stars Matt Dillon, Richard Crenna, H√©ctor Elizondo and Jessica Walter. The film tells the story of a working class boy who takes a summer job at a beach resort and learns valuable life lessons. It was the first film to receive a PG-13 rating, although it was the fifth to be released with that rating (after Red Dawn, The Woman in Red, Dreamscape and Dune). Crenna received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his supporting role and Marisa Tomei made her big screen debut with a minor role in the film. Plot In the summer of 1963, Jeffrey Willis (Matt Dillon) joins some friends for a day of gin rummy at the El Flamingo Club, a private beach resort. There, he meets the girl of his dreams Carla Sampson (Janet Jones). After the gin game and being told of the club's strict policy regarding guests, Jeffrey is upset, but not for long, since he immediately lands a job as a car valet and eventually, cabana steward. Jeffrey is a kid from a middle class Brooklyn family and his father (Elizondo) does not approve of him working at the private club. His hero and mentor at the resort is the reigning gin rummy card game champ, Phil Brody (Crenna), a salesman of exotic sports and luxury cars.Blank, Ed. Traditional values put to the test in an effective 'Flamingo Kid', Pittsburgh Press, December 28, 1984 Jeffrey, a winning gin rummy player himself, and his friends admire Brody and how his wins at the Gin rummy table make him seem \\"psychic,\\" knowing which cards to give up. Brody also takes a liking to Jeffrey, eventually showing him his car business, and gives him hopes that car sales are where he belongs as a career. Jeffrey gets further immersed in the \\"easy buck\\", as evidenced by Phil showing off his success, as opposed to Mr. Willis' manual labor, or the example of Phil's brother, who studied for years to become a lawyer but has had little financial return. During dinner, Jeffrey notably says he \\"will not be needing college\\" and plans to pursue being a car salesman instead. Jeffrey and his co- workers at the El Flamingo also venture to Yonkers Raceway together, risking cash on a horse tip but coming up short when the trotter breaks stride. Eventually, Jeffrey leaves home to pursue the sales job. However, Brody, angry that Jeffrey disturbed him during a dance class, reveals to Jeffrey that the job opening at the car dealership is for a stock boy, not as a salesman as Jeffrey had been led to believe was his when he asked for it. Brody lectures Jeffrey in a similar lesson that Mr. Willis had \\"You can't plant a tree and expect to hang a swing on it the next day\\", and recommends Jeffrey accept the stock boy job to prove himself and work his way up. Jeffrey becomes shocked at his mentor's actions and reconsiders college. Near summer's end, Jeffrey observes that a regular onlooker, \\"Big Sid\\", is feeding signals to Brody, the true cause of Brody's winning ways. When Big Sid and a member of the gin team playing against Brody's team are overcome by the heat, Jeffrey fills in, opposing Brody, and seeking to help win back the unfair profits Brody won from his friends over the course of the summer. Jeffrey and his team eventually win back what was unfairly lost, including a good profit besides. Impressed that Jeffrey defeated him without cheating, Phil says they can \\"skip this stock boy nonsense\\" and offers him the salesman job, but Jeffrey declines. Realizing the mistakes he made in rejecting his father's good advice, Jeffrey makes up with his dad in a touching scene at Larry's Fish House (\\"Any Fish You Wish\\"), where his family is dining.

The plant opened in 1935 to produce Chevrolets and closed on May 13, 2005. It was a two-level plant located in the Canton Industrial Center to the east of the Inner Harbor, to the west of Dundalk, and south of Brewers Hill in Baltimore. Early in 1942, car and truck production was interrupted when the plant was converted to wartime activities. The Chevrolet portion of the plant operated as a military parts depot where parts were received, processed and packaged for shipment around the world. The Fisher Body plant became part of the Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors Corp. and was assigned the task of assembling fuselages for Grumman carrier-based aircraft. Although Chevrolet cars and trucks had represented the largest portion of the Baltimore plant's production, other car lines also have been manufactured. The versatility of the plant was tested in 1964 when Buicks, Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs were assembled one after another on the same passenger car line. In the ensuing years, the number of car lines produced has changed several times. GMC Truck and Coach Division shared Baltimore's truck production as early as the 1947 model year. Baltimore Assembly scored a major coup with the 1984 decision to assemble the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari minivans there. The rival Dodge Caravan was selling briskly, but the truck-like GM vans were larger than most of the mini-vans then coming into production. The GM vans filled a unique market for a midsize van with large interior space and very good towing capacity. The vans were periodically updated with revised interiors and exterior styling during the very long production run. Both two-wheel drive (M van) and all-wheel drive (L-van) models were produced. Initial production from 1985 to 1989 was a short-body van, with an extended-body (aft of the rear wheels) option available from 1990 to 1994. Due to overwhelming popularity, only extended versions were available from 1995 to 2005. The plant closed its doors after the final shift on May 13, 2005. In total, approximately 3,200,000 Astro and Safari vans were produced at the Baltimore plant. GM has since sold the site to the developer Duke Realty, who has demolished the old plant and is rebuilding the site as an industrial park called the Chesapeake Commerce Center.

Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel or hoop known as the Rh√∂nrad, gymnastics wheel, gym wheel, or German wheel, in the beginning also known as ayro wheel, aero wheel, and Rhon rod.  Wheel design  The large wheel consists of two circles, which are connected with six spokes. Two are simple tubes, two are equipped with a handle and two have a footrest. The diameter of the wheel depends on the length of the gymnast, so that the gymnast can hold himself on the grips when fully stretched. The wheels are available from a diameter of 130 to 245cm. The wheels weigh between 40 and 60 kg. They are available in several depths and colors. History The wheel was invented in 1925 by Otto Feick in Sch√∂nau an der Brend. The grandson of a blacksmith, Feick was inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood in Reichenbach, when he had tied sticks between two hoops that his grandfather had made and rolled down a hill. He filed for a patent as \\"wheel- gymnastic and sports equipment\\". He had invented the wheel in Ludwigshafen am Rhein 1920‚Äì1922, on the grounds of the VSK Germania, a sports club, of which he was the founding chairman. The patent was issued on 8 November 1925; the name \\"Rh√∂nrad\\" has been registered and protected since 1926 (\\"Rh√∂n\\" is the name of the mountain region where the wheel was invented). The Rh√∂nrad was featured at the GeSoLei trade fair held in D√ºsseldorf in 1926. In 1936, this sport was shown at the Olympic Games in Berlin, but was not presented as an Olympic discipline. The focus of wheel gymnastics remains largely in Germany, but there are wheel groups in several countries and every 2 years the International Wheel Gymnastics Federation holds a World Championships competition. Former world champion wheel gymnast Wolfgang Bientzle moved from Germany to Chicago and runs his own company WHEEL JAM to educate and train people of every age to do Wheel gymnastics.

Crews played Julius Rock on the UPN/CW sitcom Everybody Hates Chris. He hosted the U.S. version of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and starred in the BET reality series The Family Crews. He appeared in films such as Friday After Next (2002), White Chicks (2004), Idiocracy (2006), Blended (2014), and the Expendables series. Since 2013, he has played NYPD Lieutenant Terry Jeffords in the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine. He began hosting America's Got Talent in 2019, following his involvement in the same role for the program's spin-off series, America's Got Talent: The Champions. Crews played as a defensive end and linebacker in the National Football League (NFL), for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, and Washington Redskins, as well as in the World League of American Football (WLAF) with the Rhein Fire, and college football at Western Michigan University. Crews, a public advocate for women's rights and activist against sexism, has shared stories of the abuse his family endured at the hands of his violent father. He was included among the group of people named as Time Person of the Year in 2017 for going public with stories of sexual assault. Early life and education Crews was born on July 30, 1968 in Flint, Michigan, the son of Patricia and Terry Crews. He grew up in a strict Christian household in Flint, and was raised mainly by his mother. His father was an alcoholic, and was abusive to his mother. Crews received a flute from his great aunt, and took lessons for eight years. After earning his high school diploma from Flint Southwestern, he received a Chrysler-sponsored art scholarship at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Interlochen, Michigan, which was followed by an Art Excellence scholarship and a full athletic scholarship for football at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan. As a defensive end for the WMU Broncos, Crews earned All-Conference honors and won the 1988 Mid-American Conference Championship. American football career Crews was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the 11th round of the 1991 NFL Draft. His career included stints with the Rams (6 games), the San Diego Chargers (10 games), the Washington Redskins (16 games), and the Philadelphia Eagles (no games). He also played for the Rhein Fire during the 1995 WLAF season.Terry Crews - Paul Zimmerman, Sports Illustrated, December 11, 1995 Repeatedly cut from rosters, Crews often supplemented his football income by receiving portrait commissions from teammates. Acting career After retiring from the NFL in 1997, Crews moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He had held a long-standing ambition to work in the film industry, but up until then had no plans to pursue acting, and simply wanting to be involved in some way. A year earlier, he had co-written and co-produced the independent feature film Young Boys Incorporated. A self-funded production filmed in Detroit with an anti-drug message, the film drew on his own observations, as well as those of his friends and family. Despite describing it as a \\"horrible\\" film, he credits the experience with getting him interested in the film industry. In 1999, Crews auditioned for a role as a character athlete (known as Warriors) in the syndicated game show Battle Dome, which became his first acting part. He played T-Money for two seasons until its cancellation in 2001. The audition process and the opportunity to perform in front of an audience made him realize that he wanted to pursue acting as a career. However, he failed to land another acting job for the following two years.Appearance on the Late Late Show with James Corden, September 23, 2016 Appearances in commercials, such as Old Spice, films, and music videos soon followed. His breakout role came in Friday After Next starring rapper-turned- actor Ice Cube, for whom Crews had previously worked as on-set security. Having never taken acting classes, instead he asked himself what the audience wanted, and he believes this ultimately brought him success. He now believes acting is what he was born to do and would not wish to have any other career, despite the physically demanding nature of the work. Based on his performance in White Chicks (2004), Adam Sandler changed a role in The Longest Yard (2005) to give it to Crews, who had auditioned for another role in the film. His role as Julius Rock, the father on the UPN/CW sitcom on Everybody Hates Chris, brought Crews wider public recognition, and the series aired for four seasons from 2005 to 2009. Since then, Crews has had main roles as husband and father Nick Kingston-Persons in the TBS sitcom Are We There Yet?, which aired for three seasons from 2010, and as NYPD Sergeant (and commencing in Season 7, Lieutenant) Terry Jeffords in the Fox/NBC ensemble sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which premiered in 2013. Crews has predominantly portrayed comedic characters, sometimes playing off of his athletic physique. Crews has appeared mainly in comedic roles, such as President Camacho in Idiocracy, but he later found success in action roles beginning with his part as Hale Caesar in The Expendables series, which saw him make his first appearance in a film sequel. Although he has managed to sustain an athletic physique in his career as an actor, Crews has avoided being type-cast as a muscle-bound action hero and has attained critical success through exploiting the contrast of his elaborate character comedy with his physique, which extends to the point of even mocking the stereotype of the gym-obsessed bodybuilder. This contrast has also led to sustained work as part of various humorous Old Spice TV commercials. He has lent his voice to animations such as American Dad! and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. He found that he enjoyed the work and sought out more of it, finding satisfaction in how it carries his spirit into the animation. From 2010 to 2011, Crews starred in his own reality series on BET, The Family Crews. It ran for two seasons. From 2014 to 2015, he hosted the syndicated game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He has also been the American host of Netflix's Ultimate Beastmaster. Crews cites the many similarities between acting and professional football, including the structure and expectations, as helping his transition between the two careers. He credits Reginald Hubbard with mentoring him in his early career in the film business. In June 2017, he was cast in the science fiction comedy film Sorry to Bother You. The film was released in theaters on July 6, 2018. Also in 2018, he appeared as Bedlam in the superhero film Deadpool 2. Crews made appearances in the music videos for \\"Pressure\\" and ‚ÄúAlgorithm‚Äù by British rock band Muse. Crews also starred in the video for Brittany Howard's 2019 song \\"Stay High\\" in which he lip syncs the vocals. Artistic work=Illustration and portraiture Crews's first job in the entertainment industry was as a courtroom sketch artist in Flint, Michigan. He received an art scholarship from college before an athletic scholarship. He later worked as courtroom sketch artist for WJRT. During his football career, Crews supplemented his income by creating portraits of fellow players. At times it was the primary income on which his family depended, typically bringing $5,000 for a two-month commission. His work included a series of NFL-licensed lithographs. He believes his imaginative side has transferred itself to his acting work. Design Crews is a co-founder of design company Amen&Amen;, with fashion designer Nana Boateng. Their first collection was a set of furniture and light fixtures designed by Ini Archibong. Personal life Crews with his wife Rebecca in South Korea, 2019 Crews married Rebecca King on July 29, 1989. They have five children and one grandchild. He is a devout Christian. In 2014, Crews released his autobiography, Manhood: How to Be a Better Man or Just Live with One. In the book, Crews detailed his long-standing pornography addiction, which had seriously affected his marriage and his life, but which he overcame around 2009 and 2010 after entering rehabilitation. Since then he has taken an active role in speaking out about the condition and its impact. Sexual assault On October 10, 2017, in the wake of numerous Hollywood actresses going public with their stories of sexual harassment and assault by film producer Harvey Weinstein, Crews revealed that a male Hollywood executive had groped him at a party in 2016 but he did not report the incident for fear of retaliation. It was later revealed that the \\"high-level executive\\" was Adam Venit, head of the motion picture department of the talent company William Morris Endeavor (WME). For his part in coming forward with the sexual assault allegations, Crews was named as one of the \\"Silence Breakers\\" from the Time Person of the Year award in 2017. WME reportedly concluded from an investigation that the incident was isolated. Venit was demoted and returned to work after a one-month suspension. In response, Crews stated, \\"Someone got a pass\\". Crews filed a lawsuit against Venit and WME for sexual assault. Some witnesses stated that Venit had gotten intoxicated, dismissed the groping as \\"horseplay\\", and apologized to Crews the next day. WME responded to the lawsuit, arguing that their reaction to Crews' claims was \\"both swift and serious\\". In March 2018, prosecutors decided not to file any charges against Venit. The city attorney's office announced that the statute of limitations to prosecute Venit had expired, as the incident was in February 2016 and Crews had not reported it until November 2017. LGBTQ comments In March 2019, Crews faced criticism and backlash after responding to a New York Times op-ed by human rights lawyer Derecka Purnell, who stated, \\"Love is not gendered. A child will not starve with only one gender loving them.\\" Crews responded, \\"But they will be severely malnourished.\\" Crews deleted the tweet and apologized the next day after speaking with his Brooklyn Nine-Nine co-star Stephanie Beatriz, stating, \\"Had a great talk with @iamstephbeatz this morning on set that shed a lot of light on why the LBGTQ community were hurt by my comments. I want to apologize for anyone who was triggered or felt targeted. I was speaking out of my very personal experiences as a black Father.\\" FilmographyReferencesExternal links * BET Shows ‚Äì The Family Crews website  Just Sports Stats Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American comedians Category:20th- century American male actors Category:21st-century American comedians Category:21st-century American male actors Category:Actors from Flint, Michigan Category:African-American Christians Category:African-American artists Category:African-American comedians Category:African-American game show hosts Category:African-American male actors Category:African-American male comedians Category:African-American players of American football Category:African-American bodybuilders Category:American actor-athletes Category:American artists Category:American football defensive ends Category:American football linebackers Category:American game show hosts Category:American male comedians Category:American male film actors Category:American male television actors Category:American male voice actors Category:Courtroom sketch artists Category:Los Angeles Rams players Category:Male actors from Michigan Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:Rhein Fire players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Sportspeople from Flint, Michigan Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Western Michigan Broncos football players Category:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

Saint James Press, 1998, The brand is known for its designer jeans that were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since the 2000s, Jordache has also diversified into real estate in the United States and other ventures in Israel. The brand name Jordache is a contraction of Joe, Ralph, David, and Avi Naccache (Nakash). History Jordache originated in 1969, when Israel brothers Joe, Ralph, and Avi Nakash (Naccache) opened a store in New York City that sold premium jeans. Inspired by European fashions, the brothers had developed a groundbreaking collection with a signature fit that was tight and sexy. Business expanded over the years, until the store was looted and set ablaze during the New York City blackout of 1977. In 1978, after they collected $120,000 from their insurance policy, they incorporated their business and started to manufacture. They had long been interested in the European denim market, where jeans were more body-conscious and fashion-forward. The Nakashes' timing was right. At this moment, consumer taste in jeans was shifting from established brands such as Levi's to designer jeans such as Gloria Vanderbilt and Calvin Klein. However, Jordache jeans were barely distinguishable from other designer jeans on the market. To differentiate their brand, the brothers invested one quarter of their annual sales volume ($300,000 of their own money and $250,000 in loans) into an aggressive 1979 ad campaign. Jordache produced a television commercial starring an apparently topless woman in tight Jordache jeans riding a horse through surf. The ad was rejected by all three major United States television networks, but independent New York stations aired it, and Jordache increased significantly in popularity. Later, an additional one million dollars was spent on advertising, including full-color advertisements in magazines circulated nationally in the United States. One promotional gimmick that did not work out was the Jordache blimp, a poorly designed airship that crashed on October 8, 1980 at Lakehurst, New Jersey on its maiden flight. It was en route to a promotional gala and crashed 43 years after the Hindenburg airship disaster in the same city.Associated Press, \\"Blimp Crashes Near Zeppelin Crash Site\\", Anderson Independent, Anderson, South Carolina, Thursday, October 9, 1980, page 4A In the 1980s, the company expanded its reach with expansive licensing that generated up to $300 million per year of wholesale income. In 1989, the company had 100 licensees, manufacturing products as varied as children's socks, women's outerwear, jewelry, dresses, luggage, and umbrellas. In the 1990s, this strategy appeared to have backfired, and Jordache products slid in popularity. The company's jeans \\"lost their cachet, appealing mainly to inner-city youth and blue-collar workers, and typically selling at discount stores.\\" When Jordache designer diapers were manufactured by a licensee in 1994, they \\"seemed to symbolize Jordache's descent in the marketplace to mass-merchandise stores and discount outlets.\\" Jordache today Today, Jordache Enterprises is a privately held conglomerate. The company designs and manufactures a wide variety of denim, apparel and accessories. In 2018, Jordache unveiled a premium denim collection in celebration of the brand's 40th anniversary. The brands owned by Jordache Enterprises include but are not limited to, Jordache, Earl Jeans, KIKIT Jeans, Maurice Sasson, Fubu Ladies, Airport, Blue Star, and Gasoline. Jordache is also an official licensee of the U.S. Polo Assn. brand. Jordache Enterprises also manufactures private label denim for companies worldwide. Through the initial proceeds from the Jordache label, the Nakash brothers have expanded into Jordache Enterprises, Inc., with interests in real estate, hospitality, aviation, high-tech cryptography, maritime ventures, and agriculture. Among its more notable holdings beyond its namesake brand are real estate holdings in New York City, The Setai Miami Miami, hotels throughout Europe and Israel, part of the Strip House restaurant chain, management of the Port of Eilat following its privatization, Arkia, Israel's second largest airline, and MG Aviation, an aircraft leasing firm with aircraft currently under lease to Norwegian Air Shuttle and eventually Arkia. Jordache Enterprises has two separate boards‚Äîone comprising six Nakashes and an outside board with 10 non- family members. Each male member of the second generation is highly specialized and has a nominal responsibility.{fact} See also * List of airship accidents ReferencesExternal links *Jordache Apparel website * Jordache Enterprises Corporate Portfolio website Category:Jeans by brand Category:Clothing brands of the United States Category:Clothing companies based in New York City Category:American companies established in 1969 Category:Clothing companies established in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in New York (state) Category:1970s fashion Category:1980s fashion Category:1990s fashion ","title":"Jordache"},{"id":"1882525","text":"Castle at Gisors The cutting of the elm was a diplomatic altercation between the kings of France and England in 1188, during which an elm tree near Gisors in Normandy was felled. Diplomatic significance France in 1180. The King of England held all the red territories. Gisors lay in the Vexin, between Anglo-Norman land and the royal domain. In the 12th century, the tree marked the traditional place of Franco-Norman negotiations, as the field was located on the border between Normandy, ruled by the English king, and the royal domains of the French king.Nicholas Vincent, \\"William Marshal, King Henry II and the Honour of Chateauroux \\".W.L. Warren, Henry II, Yale University Press, p. 617. Accounts One accountBradford Smith, The Foundations of the West - Course Material, \\"Chapter 8 The Age of the Crusades - The Rise of France under Philip Augustus and of St. Louis \\". narrates the meeting between King Henry II of England and King Philip II of France in 1188, following the fall of Jerusalem: > At Gisors, Henry II and his advisers stood under an Elm tree while Philip > and his entourage suffered in the full heat of the sun. After the meeting, > Philip ordered the tree cut down and hacked to pieces, sending the message > that he would offer no quarter to the English. A quite different account is given by the Minstrel of Rheims (c. 1260), a thirteenth-century historical fiction:A Thirteenth-Century Minstrel's Chronicle, a translation by Robert Levine of the R√©cits d'un m√©nestrel de Reims, a thirteenth-century historical fiction. > King Richard sent a message to the counts of Sancerre and of Barre, telling > them that they took the king's bread and gave him nothing in return but if > they were brave enough to come to the elm tree at Gisors, he would consider > them truly courageous.

Popular culture The event has been used in the history proposed by Pierre Plantard and other pseudo-historical theories. In this context, the Cutting of the elm was portrayed as marking the split between the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion.

It was designed by the Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Miluniƒá in cooperation with Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry on a vacant riverfront plot. The building was designed in 1992 and was completed four years later in 1996.Nationale-Nederlanden Building Frank O. Gehry, The Architect's Studio. Digital catalog of the Henry Art Gallery at arcspace. Archived. The non-traditional design was controversial at the time because the house stands out among the Baroque, Gothic and Art Nouveau buildings for which Prague is famous. The then Czech president, V√°clav Havel, who lived next to the site for decades, had avidly supported this project, hoping that the building would become a center of cultural activity. Gehry originally named the house Fred and Ginger (after the dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ‚Äì the house resembles a pair of dancers)‚ÄúDancing House in Prague ‚Äì Ginger and Fred‚Äù, last modified March 26, 2012 but this nickname is now rarely used. Gehry himself was later \\"afraid to import American Hollywood kitsch to Prague\\",Interview with V. Miluniƒá and thus discarded his own idea. Origin Comparison of Dancing House site in 1945 and 2010 The \\"Dancing House\\" is set on a property of great historical significance. Its site was the location of a house destroyed by the U.S. bombing of Prague in 1945. The plot and structure lay decrepit until 1960 when the area was cleared. The neighboring plot was co-owned by the family of V√°clav Havel who spent most of his life there. As early as 1986 (during the Communist era), Vlado Miluniƒá, then a respected architect in the Czechoslovak milieu, conceived an idea for a project at the place and discussed it with his neighbour, the then little-known dissident V√°clav Havel. A few years later, during the Velvet Revolution Havel became a popular leader and was subsequently elected president of Czechoslovakia. Thanks to his authority the idea to develop the site grew. Havel eventually decided to have Miluniƒá survey the site, hoping for it to become a cultural center, although this was not the result. The Dutch insurance company Nationale-Nederlanden (from 1991 till 2016 ING Bank) agreed to sponsor the building of a house on site. The \\"superbank\\" chose Miluniƒá as the lead designer and asked him to partner with another world-renowned architect to approach the process. The French architect Jean Nouvel turned down the idea because of the small square footage, but the Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry accepted the invitation. Because of the bank's excellent financial state at the time, it was able to offer almost unlimited funding for the project.‚ÄúDancing House‚Äù, last modified March 26, 2012 From their first meeting in 1992 in Geneva, Gehry and Miluniƒá began to elaborate Miluniƒá's original idea of a building consisting of two parts, static and dynamic (\\"yin and yang\\"), which were to symbolize the transition of Czechoslovakia from a communist regime to a parliamentary democracy. Structure Windows of the Dancing House The style is known as deconstructivist (\\"new-baroque\\" to the designers) architecture due to its unusual shape. The \\"dancing\\" shape is supported by 99 concrete panels, each a different shape and dimension. On the top of the building is a large twisted structure of metal nicknamed Mary'. In the middle of a square of buildings from the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the Dancing House has two main parts. The first is a glass tower that narrows at half its height and is supported by curved pillars; the second runs parallel to the river and is characterized by undulating mouldings and unaligned windows. The famous dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are represented in the structure. A tower made of rock is used to represent Fred. This tower also includes a metal head. A tower made of glass is used to represent Ginger. This design was driven mainly by aesthetic considerations: aligned windows would make evident that the building has two more floors, although it is the same height as the two adjacent nineteenth century buildings. The windows have protruding frames, such as those of paintings, as the designer intended for them to have a three-dimensional effect. The winding mouldings on the fa√ßade also serve to confuse perspective and diminish contrast with the surrounding buildings.{http://en.wikiarquitectura.com/index.php/Dancing_House \\"Dancing House\\"}, last modified March 26, 2012 Interior The British architect, Eva Ji≈ôiƒçn√°, designed most of the interior. The building is 9 floors tall and consists of two floors underground. The layout of each of the floors varies due to the asymmetric shape of the building, causing the rooms inside to also be asymmetric. The commercial areas of the building are in the lobby and the first floor. The six floors above are used primarily as office spaces. The ninth floor housed a restaurant. Since the building takes a slim shape, and the building is split into two parts vertically, the office space is limited. To make the most of the space, architect Ji≈ôiƒçn√° used design elements common in ships and incorporated small hallways into the interior of the building. The total interior of the building is 3,796 sqm. In 2016, over a course of five months, two floors of the building were renovated into a 21-room hotel by Luxury Suites s.r.o. The hotel also has apartments available in each of the tower named after Fred and Ginger. The Ginger & Fred Restaurant now operates on the seventh floor. There is now a glass bar on the eighth floor. There is also now an art gallery in the building. Awards The general shape of the building is now featured on a gold 2,000 Czech koruna coin issued by the Czech National Bank. The coin completes a series called \\"Ten Centuries of Architecture\\". The Dancing House won Time Magazine's design contest in 1997. The Dancing House was also named one of the 5 most important buildings in the 1990s by Architekt Magazine.  Criticism  The Dancing House has been called inappropriate in the classical city of Prague. The style, shape, heavy asymmetry, and material were seen as out of place by critics.

In 1322, he staged a revolt and made overtures to the Mamluks of Egypt to form an alliance against the Ilkhanate. Chupan, however, travelled to R√ºm with the Ilkhan Abu Sa'id's permission and convinced his son to surrender. He then secured a pardon for Timurtash and even had him reinstated as viceroy of Rum. He was responsible for extending the borders of R√ºm all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. During this campaign he conquered the territories of the Eshrefids and Hamidids. (However, later Hamidids recovered) Upon learning of his father's flight and execution in 1327, Timurtash made his way to the court of the Mamluks. He was received warmly by Sultan Al-Nasr Muhammad at first but quickly wore out his welcome. At the behest of Abu Sa'id, Al-Nasr had him executed in July or August 1328. Timurtash had four sons: Hasan Kucek, Malek Asraf, Malek Astar, and Mesr Malek. Hasan Kucek late created an independent state in northwestern Persia using the memory of Timurtash as a rallying cry.

As one of the Brahma Vihara (meditative states), it is a pure mental state cultivated on the Buddhist path to nirvƒÅna. Pali literature Many passages in the Pali Canon and post-canonical commentary identify upekkha as an important aspect of spiritual development. It is one of the Four Sublime States (brahmavihara), which are purifying mental states capable of counteracting the defilements of lust, aversion and ignorance. As a brahmavihara, it is also one of the forty traditionally identified subjects of Buddhist meditation (kammatthana). In the Theravada list of ten paramita (perfections), upekkha is the last-identified bodhisattva practice, and in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment (bojjhanga), it is the ultimate characteristic to develop. To practice upekkha is to be unwavering or to stay neutral in the face of the eight vicissitudes of life‚Äîwhich are otherwise known as the eight worldly winds or eight worldly conditions: loss and gain, good-repute and ill- repute, praise and censure, and sorrow and happiness (the Attha Loka Dhamma). The \\"far enemy\\" of Upekkha is greed and resentment, mind-states in obvious opposition. The \\"near enemy\\" (the quality which superficially resembles upekkha but which subtly opposes it), is indifference or apathy. In the development of meditative concentration, upekkha arises as the quintessential factor of material absorption, present in the third and fourth jhana states: Contemporary exposition American Buddhist monk Bhikkhu Bodhi wrote: :\\"The real meaning of upekkha is equanimity, not indifference in the sense of unconcern for others. As a spiritual virtue, upekkha means stability in the face of the fluctuations of worldly fortune. It is evenness of mind, unshakeable freedom of mind, a state of inner equipoise that cannot be upset by gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. Upekkha is freedom from all points of self-reference; it is indifference only to the demands of the ego-self with its craving for pleasure and position, not to the well-being of one's fellow human beings. True equanimity is the pinnacle of the four social attitudes that the Buddhist texts call the 'divine abodes': boundless loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity. The last does not override and negate the preceding three, but perfects and consummates them.\\" See alsoReferences Category:Buddhist terminology Category:Wholesome factors in Buddhism ko:Î∂àÍµê Ïö©Ïñ¥/„ÖÖ#ÏÇ¨ ","title":"Upek·π£ƒÅ"},{"id":"1882553","text":"Lords of the Rising Sun is a 1989 video game by Cinemaware, game design and art by Doug Barnett, released for the Amiga among other systems.

Guthridge initially gained recognition after serving for 30 years as Dean Smith's assistant at the University of North Carolina. Following Dean Smith's retirement in 1997, Guthridge served as head coach of the Tar Heels for three seasons. He took the team to the NCAA Final Four twice in his three seasons and was named national coach of the year in 1998, before retiring in 2000.http://static.espn.go.com/ncb/news/2000/0630/612432.html Background Guthridge was born in Parsons, Kansas. He attended Kansas State University, and graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1960 and an M.A. in Education in 1963. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. While a student at Kansas State, Guthridge played guard under head coach Fred \\"Tex\\" Winter, and helped the team advance to the 1958 Final Four. After graduating from Kansas State, he coached at Scott City High School in Kansas for two seasons before returning to his alma mater as an assistant coach for Tex Winter from 1962-1967. In five years on Winter's staff, Guthridge helped lead the Wildcats to a 93-43 record, a pair of Big Eight Conference crowns and the 1964 NCAA Final Four. He also was head golf coach for the Wildcats. Following his stint at Kansas State, Guthridge moved to North Carolina to join the staff of fellow Kansas native Dean Smith. From 1972 onward, he was Smith's top assistant. In 1976, he also served as an assistant coach to Smith as the United States won the gold medal in men's basketball at the Summer Olympics in Montreal. As an assistant, Guthridge was renowned for his success in coaching the fundamentals of pivot play to a long series of successful UNC big men, and as the Tar Heels' primary shooting coach. Guthridge also handled many day-to- day responsibilities in the program and oversaw UNC's summer basketball camps. While serving as an assistant coach, Guthridge turned down several head coaching opportunities, preferring to remain in Chapel Hill working alongside Smith. On one occasion, he actually accepted the head coaching post at Penn State, but stepped down from the post a few days later. Head coaching career Dean Smith unexpectedly retired as head basketball coach at North Carolina just two months before the start of the 1997‚Äì98 season, and Guthridge was immediately named his successor. School officials stressed that Guthridge was not merely a placeholder for then-Kansas coach Roy Williams, signing him to a five-year contract. In his three seasons as head coach Guthridge led the Tar Heels to the NCAA Final Four twice, in 1998 and again in 2000. He is one of five people to have appeared in the Final Four as both a player and coach. In 1998, Guthridge inherited a team that had been to the 1997 Final Four the previous year under Smith. With a wealth of returning talent, Guthridge instituted a \\"six starters\\" system, whereby the team's top six players, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, Ed Cota, Shammond Williams, Ademola Okulaja and Makhtar N'Diaye rotated positions in the starting five. Guthridge coached that team to the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship, a school record-tying 34 wins (including 30 wins going into the NCAA Tournament ‚Äì the most in school history at the time) and an appearance in the Final Four, where they lost to Utah. Following the 1997‚Äì98 season, several organizations named him National Coach of the Year and he received the Naismith College Coach of the Year award. The next season, the team earned a #3 seed in the 1999 NCAA tournament, but it was upset in the first round by Weber State ‚Äì as of the 2018-19 season, the only time that the Tar Heels have failed to win a game in the tournament since it dropped first-round byes in 1982. In 2000, the Tar Heels struggled in the regular season, falling out of the polls for the first time since the start of the 1990-91 season. The team finished 18-13 ‚Äì UNC's worst regular- season record in 11 years. However, the team came alive in the 2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. With the 8th seed in the South Region, they upset top-seeded Stanford in the second round and continued on to the Final Four, where the Tar Heels lost to Florida. After the 2000 season, Guthridge retired from coaching. Guthridge was involved in a total of 14 men's Final Fours as either a player or coach, more than any other person in history‚Äîone each as a player and assistant at Kansas State, 10 as a North Carolina assistant, and two as North Carolina head coach. He died at his home on May 12, 2015 after an extended illness, alongside his family.

This development came in coincidence after the start of the Sino-Soviet split. The submachine gun was type classified in 1979 and entered mass production in 1983. History The People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department issued a requirement for a weapon that can be used by Chinese military and police forces who handle public security, communications and other rear guard duties. The 208th Research Institute of China Ordnance Industry was directed to head the design. The Type 79 was supposed to enter service with the PLA after initial production was made from 1981 to 1982. During the war with Vietnam, Chinese soldiers on recon operations used the Type 79 as their main weapon, together with the Type 64. It became notorious in Chinese history since it was widely used by factions working for Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. The weapon found immediate acceptance within the People's Armed Police and Public Security Police forces after the PLA phased them out of service. The excessive rate of fire, limited magazine capacity and reliability issues, including problems of jamming were the reasons why the PLA decided to drop them as the main submachine gun. From 1981 to 1992, more than 200,000 Type 79s were made. In the early 2000s, Type 79s still in service were retrofitted with railed fore- ends to equip them with tactical accessories like gunsights and new muzzle brake devices. This was first seen with the Guangzhou Public Security Police. Other police forces that adopted the modernized Type 79s included the Shenzhen, Dongguan and Panyu Public Security Police forces. There are plans to replace the Type 79 in service with Chinese law enforcement agencies with the JH16-1, which was introduced in 2017 and chambered in 9x19mm. In PLA service, it was replaced by the QCW-05 in 2001. Design From 1971 to 1975, the prototypes failed twice in various torture tests, forcing the design committee to redesign it. This was mainly because the design of the chamber could not handle the pressure of 7.62x25 Tokarev ammunition. From the 1981 pilot production, the total production of the Type 79 was nearly 200,000 until 1992 under Liu Zhitong. The highest years of production were between 1988 and 1991. During that period the Type 79 was produced at a rate of more than 30,000 per year. The developmental period of Type 79 was 15 years with a staff of over 70 people. The design was made for use with the PLA, keeping its weight light for jungle warfare operations. The Type 79 fires 7.62 millimeter caliber steel- cored pistol bullets in either the automatic or semiautomatic mode. The gun is gas-operated rotating closed-bolt action with short stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, with a foldable butt stock. The bolt group and fire selector is influenced from the design of the Type 56 assault rifle, with the receiver and stock made from stamped steel. Setting it to \\"1\\" makes the weapon fire on single shot while setting it to \\"2\\" makes the weapon fire in bursts. Sights can be used to fire up to 100 and 200 meters. The extended magazine housing serves as the de facto forward grip. Variants=ACE Mod The first project to upgrade the Type 79 was in 2000 when Hong Kong weapon designer Li Jiahao was tasked to create a conversion kit that would allow the user to attach a SureFire-type tac light and a laser sight. This kit was used by the Guangzhou and Dongguan Public Security Police. PEAK 79 Li Jiahao continued to work on first conversion kit, which resulted in the creation of another variant known as PEAK 79. This was first shown to the public at the first China International Police Equipment Expo in 2002, which was subsequently adopted by the Shenzhen Public Security Police in the same year. The PEAK 79 consists of a Heckler & Koch MP5-type fore-end with a SureFire tac light built in with the addition of a C-MORE red dot scope. Introduced in 2008, WTW-79H is the simplified version of the PEAK 79 that allows for the installation of a tac light and laser sight. TAPS79 The TAPS79 (known as the Tactical Adapter Platform System for Type 79 SMG) is built with provisions for MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails and can have an OKO 8W red dot sight attached on the upper receiver. They were created at the same as PEAK 79, but TAPS 79 was not made public until working samples were exhibited in 2003. Testing on Type 79s with TAPS79 equipped did not finish until the end of 2003. It's known to be used by the Foshan and Guangzhou Public Security Police forces. Some models using the kit were also equipped with a corner assist shooting device mounted on the red dot scope. The TAPS79 has five iteration. MAPS79 Li's improvement versions of TAPS79. =Unnamed Test Kit= In 2014, a weapons designer Wang Jie tested a conversion kit that allows for the installation of a new set of rails over the barrel and a collapsible stock. Operational Briefcase The Type 79 was reported to be tested in an operational briefcase-type device, equipped with a laser sight for aiming. As of 2014, it was reported to have completed combat trials with Chinese police forces, including for those stationed at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

CATS was established in the early 2000s by several local business leaders in upstate New York, after the City of Rochester solicited bids from companies interested in establishing such a ferry service. After the City of Rochester built a marine passenger terminal, CATS ordered a high-speed catamaran vessel from Austal Ships in Perth, Western Australia, based on a modified version of the Auto-Express 86 model. The modifications were mostly in terms of the vessel's beam (or width), as it needed to be able to transit through the locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The vessel's registered name was Spirit of Ontario I and it arrived at Rochester on April 27, 2004. CATS heavily promoted the service and ran a contest with citizens in Ontario and New York for a marketing name for its operation, with the prize being a lifetime boarding pass. The winning name for the service was \\"The Breeze\\" and many people assumed this was the name of the vessel, however its registered name remained Spirit of Ontario I. The ferry is more than 280 feet long and can carry more than 750 passengers and 220 cars. The ferry features bars, a restaurant, movie theater, children's play area, business class, wireless Internet service, and an arcade.bloomberg businessweek: \\"Company Overview of Canadian American Transportation Systems LLC\\" Scott Associates Architects Inc was selected as the designer for the Toronto ferry terminal in the Inner Harbour area. The vessel began daily service between both ports with several 2.5 hour crossings per day, beginning on June 17, 2004. By the mid-summer, most crossings were at or near capacity and the service appeared to be successful. Since the vessel was operating between two international ports, CATS decided to register Spirit of Ontario I under the flag of Bahamas, a flag of convenience nation, to avoid Canadian or U.S. taxes. It was still required to meet all United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard safety requirements, however Canadian and U.S. registered vessels had the benefit of not requiring to pay for pilotage services, a requirement for all foreign registered vessels. End of the line This decision by CATS (which cost upwards of $6000/crossing), along with a series of unfortunate events related to charges for customs and immigration services, marine passenger terminal facilities in Toronto, and a poorly executed business plan, not to mention various delays in seeing the start of service, saw CATS shut down the entire operation on September 7, 2004, after only 11 weeks of service. Following the CATS bankruptcy, the vessel remained docked in Rochester. On February 28, 2005 a bankruptcy auction sold Spirit of Ontario I for $32 million (USD) to Rochester Ferry Company LLC, a subsidiary of the City of Rochester. Rochester Ferry Company LLC announced in April 2005 that it had selected Bay Ferries Great Lakes Limited to operate the service using Spirit of Ontario I, with the service marketed under the name \\"The Cat\\". The service resumed June 30, 2005.

It recommended closing 22 major United States military bases and the \\"realignment\\" (either enlarging or shrinking) of 33 others. On September 15, 2005, President George W.

The Commission recalculated the 20-year savings of the DOD recommendation list at just above $37 billion. Between late May and late August, the Commission reviewed the list and amended many of the Pentagon's recommendations, removing several major installations from the closure list. The Commission calculated the overall 20-year savings to the government in carrying out its amended list of recommendations as close to $15 billion. On May 12, 2005 Gen. Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the two-year effort to produce the list had several objectives: :*better integrate active and reserve units :*rearrange forces to be able to act around the globe :*make the military more flexible and agile :*improve cooperation between military service branches while training and fighting :*convert unneeded capacity into warfighting capability The 2005 BRAC round was the fifth since the process was initiated in 1988, and the first since 1995. It differed significantly from preceding rounds in several respects: :*It was the first with a nine-member commission (the 1991, 1993, and 1995 commissions had eight members) :*It was the only stand-alone round authorized by Congress (the 1988 BRAC round was initiated by the Secretary of Defense, and the 1991-1995 rounds were authorized together in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990) :*It was the first BRAC round focused on military force transformation, not infrastructure reduction :*It was the only round as part of a worldwide defense infrastructure review including U.S. installations overseas :*It was the first BRAC to impact the National Guard such that, several states filed legal proceedings to stay or have recommendations to be thrown out Recommendations Major facilities slated for closure included these: :*Fort McPherson, Georgia :*Fort Gillem, Georgia :*Naval Submarine Base New London in Connecticut (removed from list August 24, 2005) :*Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine (removed from list August 26, 2005) :*Naval Air Station Brunswick in Maine :*Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota (removed from list August 26, 2005) :*Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico (temporarily removed from closure August 26, 2005, pending review of new mission assignment; permanently removed from closure list following review and transferred to Air Force Special Operations Command) :*Fort Monmouth in New Jersey :*Defense Finance and Accounting Service in New York :* Fort Monroe, Virginia :* Brooks Air Force Base, Texas :*Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove in Pennsylvania (portion retained as a non- flying Pennsylvania Air National Guard facility) :*Naval Station Ingleside, Texas :*Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts (removed from list August 26, 2005) :*Navy Supply Corps School (Athens, Georgia), relocated to Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island in 2011. Major facilities slated for realignment included these: :*Army Human Resource Command (HRC) in Missouri, moving to the Fort Knox Military Installation in Kentucky. :*United States Army Armor School in Fort Knox, Kentucky, moving to the Maneuver Center of Excellence in Fort Benning, Georgia. :*Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. :*Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois :*Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia (extent contingent on reopening the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Florida) :*Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota :*Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska :*Rome Laboratory in New York :*Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio :*Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas :*Wilford Hall Medical Center in Texas :*Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California :*Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina By merging adjacent installations belonging to different services 13 Joint Bases were created. Results The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission resulted in a $35 billion increase in military spending, partly due to building new facilities. The military claimed, however, that it also resulted in a $4 billion reduction in annual spending.

In 1868, she gave the university a set of chimes. The first tune played at any Cornell Chimes concert is the \\"Cornell Changes\\", also known as the \\"Jennie McGraw Rag\\". They continue to be played every day from McGraw Tower on the campus. She was also the founder of the Southworth Library in Dryden, New York. Upon her death, she left a significant bequest to Cornell University. Her will designated monies for a library, McGraw Hall, a student health center, and additional monies to be used as the university wished. She was married when she was 39 to professor and librarian Willard Fiske, but lived less than two years following the wedding ceremony. Early life Dryden Historic District Jennie McGraw was born September 14, 1840 in Dryden, New York to Rhoda Southworth and John McGraw a self-made industrialist and millionaire. She was born in a house near the Southworth estate of her maternal grandfather, John Southworth, who was a farmer and millionaire. Rhoda McGraw died of tuberculosis in 1847. By the time she was 10 years old, John father moved them from Dryden. He married a second time to Nancy Amelia Southworth, Rhoda's sister, and the family lived in Westchester County, New York. Nancy died of tuberculosis, like her sister, in 1857. The McGraws moved to Ithaca in 1862 and John married a widow, Jane P. Turner Bates. McGraw was educated at Canandaigua, New York and, at about 18 years of age, at Pelham Priory in New Rochelle in Westchester County. She studied standard subjects as well as French composition, Latin, \\"social science\\", singing, and music. She could dance and play the spinet. Jane McGraw co-founded the Ladies' Union Benevolent Society. Jennie helped run a home for women over the age of 65. One wing of McGraw House continues the mission to provide housing for women who cannot afford to provide their own house. Early adulthood Merope in the art gallery of the McGraw-Fiske Mansion When she was 22, McGraw made her debut into Ithaca's society. She was sent on her first Grand Tour of Europe in 1859 by her father, who desired that she receive a classical education. She went on two other major trips to Europe. She gave Cornell its set of chimes which have been rung daily since the University's opening ceremony on October 7, 1868. They were first installed in a temporary wooden structure and later in the McGraw Tower. Every morning concert includes a playing of the \\"Jennie McGraw Rag\\", also known as \\"Cornell Changes\\". Her father discouraged suitors. Willard Fiske met Jennie in 1869 and secretly wrote love poems about her. John McGraw died on May 4, 1877. The History of Dryden states that her step-mother received $2 million from his will, while the History of Cornell University and Ithaca Times state that McGraw inherited most of her father's estate. McGraw inherited a trust of $500,000. When her grandfather Southworth died, she also inherited the money that would have otherwise have gone to her mother. She hired architect William Henry Miller to build a mansion in 1878. Two years later, construction began on what had been Cornell University land between Fall River and University Avenue in Ithaca. The house had Gothic architectural details like bartizans, turrets, and donjon keeps. Southworth Library, Dryden, New York established by Jennie McGraw in memory of her mother, Rhoda Southworth McGraw, and her grandfather, John Southworth Like her father, who did not have the benefit of a good education, McGraw believed in the importance of the creating a \\"world-class university library\\". She was the founder of the Southworth Library in Dryden. It opened in an existing building in 1884 and in a building constructed for the library in 1894. The McGraw- Fiske Mansion Marriage and death She took her last trip to Europe in 1878, in the hopes that the more temperate climate there would help her recuperate from tuberculosis; since she was a young girl, McGraw had \\"weak lungs\\". During her trip, she purchased art and furniture for the new mansion, but her health deteriorated significantly during her travels. She met up with a friend, Willard Fiske, in Venice, whom she married in Berlin in August 1880 or on July 14, 1880. Fiske was a professor of north European languages and a librarian. He had been in love with her for some time, but was reticent to express his feelings for fear of being considered a fortune hunter. Before the wedding ceremony, Fiske signed away any rights to her property. After they were married, the couple traveled up the Nile in November 1880 and McGraw became seriously ill. They went to France in June 1881, where she was told that she only had only a few weeks to live. Jennie McGraw Fiske's sarcophagus, Sage Chapel, Cornell University The Fiskes returned to the United States in early September. Quite ill, she was taken to Fiske's house, but was driven by her mansion and she was pleased to see how it had been completed. She died on September 30, 1881 and was interred in the Memorial Antechapel of the Sage Chapel at Cornell University. At her death, she had $2 million in property and $250,000 remaining in her trust. Ten years after her death, Willard Fisk sold the mansion and had the furniture and household furnishings auctioned. The house was later purchased by Edward and Clarence Wyckoff for the Chi Psi fraternity. It was destroyed in 1906 during a fire that also took the lives of seven people. Legacy McGraw Hall and McGraw Tower In her will, she gave away $300,000 ($ in today dollars) to her husband, $550,000 to her brother Joseph and his children, $200,000 to Cornell for a library, $50,000 for construction of McGraw Hall, $40,000 for a student hospital, and the remainder of her property to the University, estimated at at least $1 million, for whatever use it saw fit. Anne Whitney, Jennie McGraw Fiske, bronze relief, 1891, Uris Library, Cornell University The University's charter limited its property holdings to $3 million, but a New York State law on May 12, 1882 changed the Cornell University Charter removing the limit. Another state law disallowed more than one half of a woman's estate go to charity if she was married when she died. Fiske became quite angry when he learned of the law and that it had not been mentioned to him by the executor of the state. Fiske launched a legal assault to reacquire the money that the university could not accept, known as The Great Will Case.Michael L. Whalen. Gifts and Giving, Cornell University.Cornell Loses a Legacy: Decision Against the University in the Fisk Suit. The Highest Court Holds that it Cannot Receive the Gift ‚Äì A Big Fee For David B. Hill. The New York Times May 20, 1890. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. Once the case was settled, Fiske received about a $500,000, the McGraws received about $1 million, and the university had the rest of the estate. When he died in 1904, Fiske left most of his estate, including his personal library, to the university. Today, McGraw's name graces numerous places and things on Cornell's campus.

Mary or Maria the Jewess, also known as Mary the Prophetess (), is an early alchemist who is known from the works of the Gnostic Christian writer Zosimos of Panopolis. On the basis of Zosimos's comments, she lived between the first and third centuries A.D.Chemical History Tour, Picturing Chemistry from Alchemy to Modern Molecular Science Adele Droblas Greenberg Wiley-Interscience 2000 French, Taylor and Lippmann list her as one of the first alchemical writers, dating her works at no later than the first century.Taylor, F.

She is credited with the invention of several kinds of chemical apparatus and is considered to be the first true alchemist of the Western world. History The primary source for the existence of \\"Mary the Jewess\\" within the context of alchemy is Zosimos of Panopolis, who wrote, in the 4th century, the oldest extant books on alchemy. Zosimos described several of Mary's experiments and instruments. In his writings, Mary is almost always mentioned as having lived in the past, and she is described as \\"one of the sages\\". George Syncellus, a Byzantine chronicler of the 8th century, presented Mary as a teacher of Democritus, whom she had met in Memphis, Egypt, during the time of Pericles. The 10th century KitƒÅb al-Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadim cited Mary as one of the 52 most famous alchemists and stated that she was able to prepare caput mortuum, a purple pigment. The early medieval alchemical text ascribed to an otherwise unknown \\"Morienus Romanus\\" called her \\"Mary the Prophetess\\", and the Arabs knew her as the \\"Daughter of Plato\\" ‚Äì a name which, in Western alchemical texts, was reserved for white sulfur. Writings Although none of Mary's writings have survived, some quotations credited to her are found in hermetic writings. The most notable of these are found in The Dialogue of Mary and Aros on the Magistery of Hermes, which is an extract made by an anonymous Christian philosopher. Operations are described in this document which would later become the basis of alchemy, such as leukosis (whitening) and xanthosis (yellowing). The document describes, for the first time, an acid salt and other acids. There are also several recipes for making gold from plants (mandragora, for example). Several cryptic alchemical precepts have been attributed to Mary. She is said to have spoken of the union of opposites:Patai, p. 66. The following was known as the Axiom of Maria: Marie- Louise von Franz, an associate of psychologist Carl Jung, gives an alternative version: Carl Jung used this axiom as a metaphor for wholeness and individuation. Inventions Mary is said to have discovered hydrochloric acid, though this is not accepted by most science texts. Also mentioned in the Jewish Encyclopedia (1901‚Äì1906). Others attribute the discovery to Andreas Libavius. Mary, along with Agathodaemon, Pseudo-Democritus, and Hermes Trismegistus, was mentioned by Zosimos of Panopolis in his descriptions of certain devices, such as the tribikos, the kerotakis, and the bain-marie. But her contributions are disputed and not clear. Tribikos The tribikos () was a kind of alembic with three arms that was used to obtain substances purified by distillation. It is not known whether Mary invented it, but Zosimos credits the first description of the instrument to her. It is still used today in chemistry labs. In her writings (quoted by Zosimos), Mary recommends that the copper or bronze used to make the tubes should be the thickness of a frying pan and that the joints between the tubes and the still- head should be sealed with flour paste. Kerotakis An alchemical balneum Mariae, or Maria‚Äôs bath, from Coelum philosophorum, Philip Ulstad, 1528, Science History Institute The kerotakis ( or Œ∫œÖœÅŒøœÑŒ±Œ∫ŒØœÇ), is a device used to heat substances used in alchemy and to collect vapors. It is an airtight container with a sheet of copper upon its upper side. When working properly, all its joints form a tight vacuum. The use of such sealed containers in the hermetic arts led to the term \\"hermetically sealed\\". The kerotakis was said to be a replication of the process of the formation of gold that was occurring in the bowels of the earth. This instrument was later modified by the German chemist Franz von Soxhlet in 1879 to create the extractor that bears his name, the Soxhlet extractor. Bain-marie Mary's name survives in her invention of the bain-marie (Mary's bath), which limits the maximum temperature of a container and its contents to the boiling point of a separate liquid: essentially a double boiler. It is extensively used in chemical processes for which a gentle heat is necessary. This term was introduced by Arnold of Villanova in the 14th century. The bain-marie is also used for cooking food.

Books in the series  The Chtorr series was originally planned as a trilogy, but as the story became more intricate, Gerrold realized that three books would not be enough for him to tell the entire story. For a time, he was uncertain how many books there would be in the end but plans on seven. , four books have been completed. , a fifth and sixth were in the works, 24 years after the publication of the fourth book.  A Matter for Men (1983)  After mysterious and deadly viruses decimate the world's population, strange and violent alien creatures, dubbed the Chtorr, start to appear. Jim McCarthy is a military scientist tasked with clearing a nest of worms, one of the more well known types of Chtorr. He notices that they have a level of intelligence and brings back three eggs for further analysis. Back at base, he learns that political squabbling is getting in the way of making any real progress on understanding the invasion. He is soon recruited to a mysterious group known only as \\"Uncle Ira\\" who dedicate themselves to clearing out the Chtorr at any cost. In a presentation demonstrating a live Chtorran worm to a visiting group of dignitaries, the worm breaks loose and kills several people before it's stopped by McCarthy. He quickly realizes that the massacre, and his death, were planned by Uncle Ira as a way of getting the international community to wake up to the Chtorran problem. Along the way, Jim's best friend and sometimes lover, Ted, decides to join the Telepathy Corps, and to Jim's chagrin, seems to be losing himself to a larger hive mind. A Day for Damnation (1985) On a mission in deep Chtorran territory, Jim McCarthy and his crew crash their helicopter in a blizzard of strange pink fuzz. The crew takes this opportunity to observe previously unknown aspects of the Chtorran life cycles and ecology. Particularly interesting is an odd ritual observed between bunnymen, one of the types of alien lifeforms they see while stranded that resemble humanoid rabbits, and worms where they seem to play together in harmony. Upon return to San Francisco, McCarthy spends some time studying the zombie phenomena that surfaced soon after the invasion; massive groups of people seem to lose all but the most basic animal intelligence and wander aimlessly in herds, occasionally luring in others who get too close. Seeing a similarity between the zombies and the bunnyman/worm rituals, McCarthy briefly allows himself to join the zombie herd in order to study them, and only barely manages to be rescued and restored to his former self. Using what he learned, he leads a team near a nest of worms and attempts communication like the bunnymen. Although the experiment seems to work initially, the worms turn violent and attack the humans and other Chtorr.  A Rage for Revenge (1989)  The third book in the series alternates between two stories, Jim McCarthy experiences Mode Training and flashbacks to his time in a cult. On a routine mission, McCarthy's platoon is overwhelmed by a group of renegade humans. He is taken prisoner and slowly brainwashed into the lifestyle of the cult and their leader, Jason Delandro. The cult believes in serving the Chtorr and have several worms on their campgrounds, although only a few high-up members are allowed to know the worms' secrets. The cult also practices a type of hedonism, characterized by free love including pedophilia. On an expedition, Jim discovers a military base with a working radio. Snapping back to his senses, he calls in the renegades' location, then wanders aimlessly in the wilderness while fighting an emotional internal battle over having betrayed the renegades. Jim heads to a peninsula on the California coast where his mother used to live, called Family, and adopts three orphans. When Family's leaders ignore his demands for anti-Chtorran defenses, a group of worms break into the grounds and slaughter many of the Family, including his adopted children. Jim realizes that the worms were led by Delandro and manages to capture and execute him. Jim flees Family and after a hallucinatory experience brought on by the Chtorran ecology, he is picked up in a helicopter by Colonel Elizabeth 'Lizard' Tirelli. Jim is sent to Mode Training to learn to overcome basic human psychology. As a final test in the training, the group is forced to accept the death of one of their own, Jim, by the hand of the leader Daniel Foreman. The gun Foreman was using turns out to be loaded with blanks, and as the group accepted his death, they pass the course. Tirelli and McCarthy had previously been romantically involved, and they expand that relationship after Tirelli leads McCarthy to testify in a meeting with the President of the United States regarding the need to drop a nuclear bomb on the heavy Chtorran infestations in the Rockies, arguing that the people who live there are no longer human. A Season for Slaughter (1993)  Leading a patrol, Jim McCarthy is annoyed by a senior officer from Montreal who insisted on coming along but does not understand the gravity of the situation. In order to get him out of the way, McCarthy tricks him into thinking that the two of them had walked into the sensory network of a live shambler grove (a type of mobile Chtorran plant) and were likely to be eaten alive by the grove's residents. In reality, the grove looked dead, but the officer did not know this and agreed on record to cede all authority to McCarthy. While examining the grove, the scientists discover a massive womb-like structure beneath it that they theorize is the place where all the Chtorran life forms were formed when they fell to Earth. After being reprimanded by his commanding officer, McCarthy is sent on a mission to an area of the Amazon rainforest with some of the heaviest infestations anywhere. The mission commandeers a massive dirigible originally built as a pleasure craft before the invasion. Aboard the ship, McCarthy and Tirelli finally marry. When trying to figure out a way of communication with the worms via flashing lights, the team accidentally sets off a Chtorran war where the worms battle each other in a massive slaughter. On the way home the flight crew realize too late that Chtorran stingbugs have created too many holes in the helium chambers, causing a massive loss of lift gases. Quickly dumping cargo, the ship heads back to civilization as fast as possible but crashes when still several miles in Chtorran territory. Fearing that Liz is dead, Jim hears her voice on a radio briefly. To rescue her he contacts a government official, a woman with Down syndrome and brain implants who McCarthy correctly surmises is an unwitting member of the Telepathy Corps, and utilizes their communications network to request a search for Tirelli. Although Liz is eventually found, the book ends with everyone still awaiting rescue. A Nest for Nightmares In June 2015, the fifth book (called A Method for Madness at that time) was reportedly slated for release September 2015 but according to the author, at the end of August 2015 only the first draft was finished and given to beta readers. On March 14, 2017, Gerrold announced that the fifth book would be titled A Nest for Nightmares, and A Method for Madness would be the sixth book, with both books nearing completion. A Method for Madness On March 14, 2017, Gerrold announced A Method for Madness would be the sixth book.  Plot  Set in a devastated early 21st century United States with logical expected advances in current technology such as a fledgling moon base, this series of science-fiction novels describe the invasion of Earth by an alien ecology. The story is unusual in that the tactics used by the aliens eschew the usual direct attack in favor of terraforming the ecosystem. The United States has suffered serious political and social upheavals. These have come from unintended consequences of US government choices regarding geopolitical crises and interventionism. In the timeline of the books, there had been another US/Eastern Bloc proxy war -- between the State of Israel and certain other Middle Eastern nations -- in the recent past. This had been similar to a larger, higher-technology version of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, the 1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and others. The books do not explain the detailed conduct of the fictional new war, neither do they state which countries fought Israel. In the summer of 1997, Israel had deployed a nuclear weapon ‚Äî and the world's perception was that Israel had done so at the instructions of the United States. In a case rather like a reversal of the Cuban Missile Crisis, America had been placed under an explicit nuclear ultimatum from the Soviet Union. Modern printings of the books, however, state that the ultimatum came from Russia. The unnamed President of the United States had refused to accept that a nuclear World War III was inevitable, so he had decided to travel to Moscow, where in the year 2000 ‚Äúthe Millennium Treaties‚Äù had been signed. The United States had been substantially hobbled by the Millennium Treaties. Years later there had been subsequent treaties after the United States entered a bitter war in Pakistan. The US failed in its objectives there, and it was given another nuclear ultimatum. The second ultimatum came from the People's Republic of China. As a result, the United States was required to greatly weaken its armed forces, to comply with new bans on certain weapon systems, to make official statements of culpability for warmongering, and to undertake new programs of civic education for the young that were supposed to establish precautions against the possibility of Americans making choices to start future wars. Also, the United States was made to pay heavy reparations to the international community. America's network of allies continues to realign and break apart. Other countries continue to become more hostile, even though it is not always in a military sense of hostility. U.S. leaders respond by stimulating the domestic economy with large investments in new technologies. Secondly, the U.S. manages to surreptitiously re-structure the reparations required under the Millennium Treaties. The new US national security strategy is subtle, and has a focus on making other countries more reliant on the United States. This was done through applying economic diplomacy, sharp power, soft power, and other measures to increase foreign dependency on a variety of assets and systems controlled or heavily influenced by America. These include America's new generations of advanced robotic systems, American space-based solar power technologies, American food exports, American space transportation systems such as spaceplanes, and newly expanded efforts by agencies such as the Peace Corps and USAID. In great secrecy, the American government continues work on advanced military technologies, dual-use technologies, and finding means to leverage the revolution in military affairs to gain advantage in this radically new geopolitical situation. The books give attention to such things as high-energy microwave weapons, cyberwarfare, military teleoperation, and intelligent agents that can be militarized. All these efforts are forbidden under the Millennium Treaties. Soon afterwards, a lengthy onslaught of devastating plagues sweeps the world, killing 60% of humanity. As the survivors struggle to rebuild civilization, they gradually discover that hundreds of alien plant and animal species have mysteriously begun to entrench themselves. All these strange species are far more opportunistic and aggressive than the native organisms occupying the same ecological niches. As a result, Earth's entire ecology is being rapidly supplanted (or \\"chtorraformed\\"). The invaders are called Chtorrans after the sound made by the most deadly predator encountered so far. There are no signs of sentient aliens, but humans presume the invasion to be deliberate, either \\"seeded\\" from space or brought by undetected spacecraft. Many of the Chtorran organisms (see below) exhibit behaviors that are quasi-sentient (building structures, creating and using tools, farming/herding, setting traps, singing), yet the central question of whether they are doing so out of sentience or collective and programmed behavior is as yet unanswered. With each new layer of organisms, a bit more hierarchy to the Chtorran \\"societal\\" structure is revealed, allowing the possibility that all these organisms will transform the Earth in support of some worse, higher form of Chtorran life. The presumed goal of these off-stage aliens appears to be the complete replacement of Earth's ecology -- such that most macroscopic native organisms would be wiped out, a tiny percentage of native organisms would be altered or reconditioned to be placed under husbandry, and the aliens would presumably be able claim Earth without a single shot. Another possibility is that collectively the Chtorr are the aliens. The ecological invasion has gained enormous footholds, and humanity has yet to figure out who the true enemy is; let alone how to fight back successfully). The books largely follow the adventures of Jim McCarthy, a scientist and soldier in the U.S. Army, who attempts to understand the Chtorran ecology even as he engages in combat to destroy it. His early efforts primarily focus on the \\"Worms\\", a particularly large and dangerous apex predator Chtorran species whose prey consists largely of human beings. McCarthy and other scientists investigate the rapidly expanding webs of Chtorran ecosystems and attempt to unravel the relationships between the species. In addition to descriptions of alien ecology, the Chtorr series includes lengthy expositions on various aspects of human psychology, particularly under wartime and survival conditions.  Characters  * Jim McCarthy: The series' protagonist. The books are written from his point of view. Jim is a military scientist who was drafted into the secret \\"Uncle Ira\\" group as a way of fighting the Chtorran infection without political oversight. He is bisexual, and retains a loving relationship with Lizard Tirelli. Jim is often characterized as being very brash, abrasive and impulsive. He cannot stand when bigger issues get swallowed up in politics, and is often bailed out by Lizard or the Uncle Ira group after taking certain actions, such as goading a Qu√©b√©cois major to resign his commission out of cowardice. * Archibald \\"Duke\\" Anderson: Jim's commanding officer. * Elizabeth \\"Lizard\\" Tirelli: An officer in the US Army. She starts off as a captain who pilots helicopters, but by the fourth book she has been promoted to general and is one of the leaders of the US military in its war against the Chtorr. She is in a complicated relationship with McCarthy. * Ted: Jim's military partner and sometimes lover. Ted joins the Telepathy Corps early on in the series and has a chip implanted in his brain which allows other Telepathy Corps members to access his body. He talks about how he no longer feels a connection with his body; as part of the Corps mass mind, he can occupy and use any other Corps body. * General \\"Uncle Ira\\" Wallachstein: The leader of a top-secret military group with authorization only from the President. Officially, neither Wallachstein nor his organization even exists. The purpose of the \\"Uncle Ira\\" group is to do whatever it takes to fight the Chtorran invasion -- whether inside or outside the United States -- and they ignore the politics that inevitably get in the way. * Daniel Foreman: An enigmatic and harsh man who leads the Mode Training courses. He teaches people how to reach their potential required to fight the Chtorr by changing in and out of \\"modes\\" and how to accept the limitations and concepts of one's own psychology. He writes articles under the name \\"Solomon Short\\" and is quoted as such at the heading of the chapters in books 3 and 4. * General Wainwright: The highest-ranking member of the military shown in the books. The General is more of a politician than a fighter, and is usually characterized as putting his own troops at risk rather than risking a political bungle. He has told McCarthy numerous times that he has a personal hatred for him, something that only seems to amuse McCarthy. Wainwright has an assistant, Dannenfelser, who has an open personal dislike for McCarthy and often seeks to make him miserable. * Jason Delandro: Jason is the spiritual leader of a group of renegades living nomadically in unpopulated territory in the United States. He is very convincing and has an extremely loyal, almost religious, following. He believes in living as hosts and treating the Chtorrans as guests, with the understanding that the Chtorrans could take whatever they need, including innocent human life. Three of the members of his group are actually worms; one, Orrie, raised from birth, and the other two trained by Orrie to understand humans. The human-Chtorran relationship amongst the renegades is complex, but ultimately results in a loss of humanity for those involved (characterized by people giving their newborn babies as food to the worms) with complete acceptance of and subservience to the Chtorrans. It is possible that the character of Jason Delandro is inspired by Joseph Di Mambro and the Order of the Solar Temple.  Groups, technology and other concepts  * Telepathy Corps: The Teep Corps (as they are often referred to) is a group of people with microchips implanted in their brains to allow each member full access to every other member's memories, senses and thoughts. Although originally initiated as a government program, many characters mention a fear that the Teep Corps has become a massmind, and is free from any oversight. Members are stripped of their personal identity and lose their personal connection to their own bodies. Often, a new initiate will become \\"lost\\" by losing sentience and simply becoming a body and collection of memories for the Corps. Although it has been shown that members can show individuality, they have a different concept of what it means to be an individual. Since any member can potentially fully control any body of any other member, bodies are conceptually separate from individual minds. Many Corps members are actually not aware that they are members, as they have had the microchip implanted in them without their knowledge. This was originally done to allow the Corps to spy on renegade groups within Chtorran mandalas, but it is hinted that the process has become out of control and the Corps may have used it as a way of controlling political entities. * Zombie Herds: In some metropolitan areas, humans have been observed losing their sentience and shambling around in mindless herds. It is uncertain what is the cause of it. Zombies have been observed having almost no desires or inhibitions, acting like simple animals. Some government agencies have taken it upon themselves to feed the herds, as they seem not to possess the ability to forage for food. People who follow or spend enough time with a herd will eventually find themselves drawn in. Sometimes a herd will start up a strange sort of singing that can attract more humans to join them. Occasionally, like in moments of extreme pain or stress, a zombie will snap back to being a human, although they will retain few to no memories of time spent in the herd. By the fourth novel, zombie herds are becoming heavily infected with neural symbionts, giving them the appearance of having developed fine coats of pink fur ‚Äì apparently the first stage in their mutation into bunnydogs and libbits.  Chtorran ecology  Chtorran ecology was designed in large part by British reproductive biologist Jack Cohen. It is quite complete and consistent, making it hard science fiction. If there are two things that all Chtorran life forms have in common, it is that they are hungry, and that they change. Virtually all Chtorran life forms engage in some form of symbiosis, which can be recursive. Indeed, by later books scientists began to suspect that the \\"Chtorran biosphere\\" isn't so much a collection of different species as it is one vast hive-like superorganism, with each species not only fulfilling a niche but laying the groundwork for other more complex forms. Several species of prey animals are in fact suspected to be the juvenile versions of larger predator animals ‚Äî the few who survive to adulthood metamorphosize and feed on their younger cousins. What little can be guessed about the Chtorran homeworld is that it must have slightly higher gravity than Earth, and its atmosphere somewhat lower oxygen content‚Äîexplaining the strength of Chtorran musculature and how efficiently they process oxygen on Earth. Their planet is also suspected to be located near an older red giant star, resulting in most Chtorran creatures possessing a warm color scheme of pink to red (though this varies). Chtorran organisms use DNA as genetic material: theoretical xenobiologists explain that DNA was already predicted to be the universal basis for alien biospheres, due to its inherent chemical stability. Chtorran DNA even auto-sorts into chromosomes on a basic level, however, its inter-relations are vastly more complex than comparable Terran genetics. Chtorran molecular biology is thus compatible with Earth's, with right-handed DNA and left-handed proteins - if it wasn't, the infestation would have starved to death as soon as it began, unable to digest Terran organisms. Chtorran life forms (at least those encountered so far) seem to thrive best in semi-tropical climate zones, though they are also quite successful in tropical and temperate zones. It is speculated that they may prefer warmer climates, and have only adapted so well to the temperate zones because there are generally more humans to eat there. Whatever the case, six years into the invasion there is not a single region of the planet that does not have at least some small trace of Chtorran life forms in it, even micro- organisms. Generally, Chtorran life has been slower to spread to desert or polar regions ‚Äî again, possibly because there is simply less bio-mass to consume in them. Due to its desert climate, Australia is cited as the only inhabited continent in which the infestation has been relatively light (and it is also light in frozen Antarctica). Europe has been only moderately infested, for reasons not entirely clear (possibly because the initial plagues devastated its highly concentrated population centers so badly that Chtorrans there did not have a surplus of humans to eat). Most world militaries were wiped out in the plagues, because governments deployed their soldiers as riot police, allowing them to become infected as well. The only exception was the United States: due to losing a war in the Middle East, international pressure forced it to disarm most of its standing army, the result being that they survived the plagues and were able to be re-mobilized soon afterwards. Thus North America is also one of the few regions that has been able to put up resistance to Chtorran encroachment. Even then, much of the West Coast has been lost, due to Chtorrans breeding unnoticed in the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains until their numbers were overwhelming. The worst infected zones in the United States are in the Rocky Mountains, and in the semi-tropics of the southeastern states (Mississippi through Florida): limited nuclear strikes in these states only temporarily culled the infestation, which grew back to prior levels within a matter of months. Otherwise, vast swaths of South America, Africa, and Asia have been totally overrun. Asia in particular was hard hit by the plagues - with the exception of Japan, which due to its isolated island geography was able to survive relatively intact. Some of the absolute worst and largest Chtorran infestations are in the western United States, India, and the Amazon basin of Brazil ‚Äî areas which increasingly resemble an alien planet. Chtorran fauna * Chtorran Gastropedes (commonly known as \\"Worms\\"): The main antagonists of the series. Range in size from as small as a dog to as large as a bus, or even larger. Normally bright red, but have been seen in other colors ranging from white to green. They have two double-jointed \\"arms\\" which end in very dextrous three-digit \\"hands\\", with incredibly sharp claws. Their bodies are covered with symbiotic \\"fur\\", each strand of which is a distinct lifeform and acts as a sensory input. Thus they resemble large, furry pink caterpillars‚Äîwith a pair of large goggle-like eyes atop their heads, clawed arms, and rasping tooth-filled mouths. Worms are capable of remarkable acts of problem solving and interaction and some have been observed to understand a rudimentary form of English, but both their intelligence and their communication abilities have yet to be fully understood. As long as they eat meat, they can continue to grow; their growth slows when their diet is only on vegetation, but their appetite is much larger. It is understood that a worm \\"family\\" consists of four, though their roles are unclear. When a group of worms form a family, they build a large, domed structure referred to as a hut. The worms live in a series of tunnels within and beneath the huts. When many huts are built close together, they start to merge into larger huts, and so on. This process repeats recursively, forming Chtorran cities which the military calls mandalas due to their spiraling shapes. When a worm reaches a mass that makes it unable to move, it will crawl into a dead end corner of the nest and eventually die‚Äîit is suspected though not confirmed that these older individuals incubate new gastropede eggs which burst out of them in death. While the worms do form social units of four, scientists remain baffled at how exactly they reproduce. Analysis of their complex genetic material seems to indicate that they don't have different sex chromosomes, so every worm should be one biological gender ‚Äî but whether this means they reproduce with each other (like Terran slugs) or reproduce through fission of some kind, remains unknown. By the second novel, scientists observe that the gastropedes do not seem to fit within the Chtorran ecology's food chain ‚Äî at least what parts of it are currently present on Earth. While they do eat Chtorran millipedes and bunnymen, the ratio of protein they provide versus the vast amounts the worms need to consume simply doesn't match up. Thus the gastropedes can only meet their dietary needs by eating native Terran life forms as well, i.e. humans. This leads some scientists to suspect that the gastropedes are essentially \\"sheep dogs\\" for whatever intelligence is truly directing the invasion, a servant race intentionally set loose on Earth for the express purpose of wiping out the indigenous large life forms, specifically humans. * Neural Symbionts: The most ubiquitous creature in the ecology. The neural symbiont is a small, hair-like creature that attaches itself to the nervous system of a larger creature. The host will then achieve heightened senses, reflexes and some form of communication with other hosts. Many Chtorrans such as the gastropedes and bunnydogs are completely covered in symbionts‚Äîin what appears to be a very dense \\"fur\\" of light pink to red hairs. It is theorized that the symbionts actually do most of the thinking and communication for their host creatures, thus accounting for the small brain yet high functionality in many Chtorrans. Humans that bond with symbionts soon lose the ability, or will, to communicate with uninfected humans, but can live in harmony inside a Chtorran mandala. Outside of a mandala, symbiosis is usually fatal to Earth creatures. Some scientists suspect that the neural symbionts, acting as a hive mind, essentially are the main leaders of the invasion‚Äîif there can even be said to be one leader. An alternative view is that the entire Chtorran biosphere is a superorganism which can be thought of as a large body, in which case the neural symbionts are the brains. Although most often observed on the gastropedes and bunnydogs, neural symbionts are ubiquitous throughout the Chtorran ecology, found not only on Chtorran animals such as gorps but also plants such as shambler trees and manna plants. * Millipedes: These bear no relation to terrestrial millipedes. Though similar in appearance, they tend to have hard black shells and bellies of varied colors. Their bite is very powerful, and they are capable of devouring and digesting wood, leather, rubber, plastic‚Äîanything even remotely organic save their own (or worm) waste. Their bite is also toxic, introducing various diseases and micro-organisms into the bloodstream. The worms keep them in \\"corrals\\" near their huts like chicken farms‚Äîand eat them like popcorn. * Jellypigs: Small, blob-like creatures that live off of nutrients found in dirt. Their part of the ecology seems to be to dig out the tunnels and underground areas necessary for many creatures to survive. They are only found in \\"clumps\\" of several dozen or more, and often several hundred. Jellypigs excavate tunnels by literally eating as much dirt as they can: when they eat so much they slow down, millipedes or gastropedes eat them‚Äîgiven that most of their mass by this point is actually soil, these other creatures then remove it from the nest when they defecate outside. Reproduction happens when jellypigs rub against one another in a clump, cross fertilizing small eggs contained just beneath the skin. When a jellypig stops moving for a certain amount of time, the babies eat their way out of the mother. Jellypigs seem to be genetically related to gastropedes and may be a simplified version of them or an evolutionary cousin; other reports indicate that millipedes may metamorphosize into them ‚Äî or perhaps they are some sort of intermediate stage between millipede and gastropede. * Nest-boas: Snake-like creatures which inhabit gastropede mandalas. They are known to eat congregations of jellypigs, but otherwise, their exact role in the Chtorran ecology is not yet fully understood. * Snufflers: Relatively harmless to humans, snufflers are bipedal creatures ranging in size from chickens to ostriches. They somewhat resemble a headless chicken or a slug/snake mounted onto two legs. Their \\"neck\\" tapers off without a head into a circular, snout- like mouth, hence the name \\"snufflers\\". The end of their neck is ringed with eyestalks, but they do not possess a \\"head\\" as such. In more advanced gastropede mandalas, bunnymen actually ride snufflers as a basic form of transport. As observed in these more socially complex large settlements, snufflers are compared to house servants, and bunnydogs to pizza delivery men. Bunnydogs perform basic maintenance tasks on the tribal level, while on a family unit level, snufflers clean up dwellings by eating up any waste. * Enterprise Fish: These are the largest Chtorran creatures known. These creatures go through the oceans, eating anything in their path. The upper size limit is unknown, but the largest one killed massed over one million tons, and far larger ones have been reported. An individual blamed for the near-sinking of the USS Nimitz was said to be at least twice the length of the aircraft carrier, making the fish over 2,000 feet long. At least 30 of them exist in the world's oceans as of the fifth novel, tracked by satellite, but due to their massive size and near-invulnerability they have reduced humanity's dominance of the oceans. Physically, are nearly impossible to kill: their outer layers have several dozen yards of empty flesh and cartilage, with internal organs so large and widely dispersed that it is impossible for ordinary bombardment to do them serious harm: it can take up to half an hour of heavy bombardment by battleships for them to even notice they are being attacked. Only two have been killed, and only with low-yield nuclear bombs. Even then, several scientists suspect that the Enterprise Fish are just an overgrown, hairless, sea-going form of the gastropedes, and may just be a variant molt of them. * Stingflies: One of the most common Chtorran creatures, stingflies resemble large mosquitoes. Although their bite is not very harmful to humans or animals, they can attack in swarms and do a large amount of damage. They lay their eggs on a Chtorran plant called a \\"wormberry\\" and hatch once in the stomach of whatever ate the berry. Gastropedes and other Chtorrans do not seem to be harmed by stingfly larva living in their bodies, but humans can die of painful ulcers and infections if they accidentally eat stingfly eggs. Stingflies are ubiquitous around gastropede mandalas, their swarms above them so large that they noticeably dim the sunlight in the sky. Through parallel evolution, stingflies operate much like mosquitoes as a vector for Chtorran viruses and bacteria: scientists believe that they were one of the major vectors that quickly spread the devastating plagues which began the invasion. * Gorps: These large creatures resemble sloths, but stand 10‚Äì15 feet tall, with disproportionately long arms and barrel chests. They also have a short tapir-like proboscis, and a cluster of eyes. They emit a horrible smell (capable of destroying non-Chtorran life), and are mostly carrion eaters, though they do not always wait for their meals to die before they eat them. They are so-called for the noise they make, though they are also known by the military reporting name \\"Ghouls\\" due to their frightening dietary habits. Gorps are slow enough that humans can evade them fairly well, though they are lethal to anything within arm's reach. * Finger Babies: These small creatures are from one to two inches in length, and closely resemble humans. Their ecological niche appears to be that of an insect. The RPG sourcebook revealed that Finger Babies are actually embryonic Gorps. * Bunnydogs/Bunnymen: Bipedal herbivores about a meter in height possessing roughly the same intelligence as chimps. Bunnydogs are covered in the same \\"fur\\" as the worms and resemble pink or red rabbit-eared teddybears. Some Bunnydogs eventually become Bunnymen‚Äîa variant of bunnydogs that lack that fur and are about half again as tall, making them resemble bipedal rats‚Äîwith a disposition to match. Not all bunnydogs mature into bunnymen, though both are capable of reproduction. All bunnydogs/bunnymen are male. Unlike practically all other Chtorran life forms, Bunnydogs are not particularly aggressive, and are playful towards humans and each other. Bunnydogs are bubbling with joyous energy and have a massive sex drive, bouncing around trying to have sex with everything around them, particularly libbits but also other animals. * Libbits: These quadrupeds resemble pigs. Short and squat, they are covered with red fur and are very docile. They have heavyset hind legs and while they normally walk on all fours, they can rear up and use their front limbs as hands. All Libbits are female. It was later discovered that Libbits and Bunnydogs/Bunnymen are actually male and female of the same species. Their reproductive process is strange‚Äîif a single Bunnyman mates with a Libbit she will give birth to a litter of Libbits, but if multiple Bunnymen mate with a Libbit, she will produce a litter of Bunnydogs. **Assimilated humans: Humans infected by the neural symbionts turn into \\"zombie herds\\": aimless, docile, and capable of living within Chtorran mandalas (though the gastropedes will still randomly eat them from time to time, like a farmer eating his sheep). The fourth novel revealed that the later stages of Chtorran viral/parasitic infection actually mutate and transform humans into new bunnydogs and libbits‚Äîthough the process is slow and they are still disturbingly recognizable as former humans for quite some time. Because bunnydogs and libbits only live a few years before being eaten by the gastropedes they reach sexual maturity very quickly. Human scientists were deeply disturbed to discover this by comparing aerial reconnaissance photos of Chtorran mandalas over a period of months and years: mutated but still recognizable five year old human boys transformed into adult bunnydogs, gleefully having sex with everything around them until eaten without protest by the resident gastropedes, while similarly aged girls mutated into near-sessile libbits, acting as breeding vats for a new generation of bunnymen/libbits. This is the ultimate form of co-existence that the gastropedes intend for humanity: fast-breeding domesticated cattle. **Bunnydogs and libbits only started appearing in the second novel, as a new layer of the Chtorran ecology‚Äîsomewhat implying that there never were \\"original\\" bunnydogs and libbits, produced by the shambler tree wombs, but that every bunnydog and libbit seen in the series was actually either a mutated/Chtorraformed human child or a direct descendant of one. Characters in the second novel were also puzzled at why the Chtorrans were seemingly going out of their way to collect and corral human children instead of just eating them immediately (at least not all of them). Other scientists in the second novel point out how odd it is that the bunnydogs seem to be herbivores, yet still have forward-facing eyes like a predator animal (for stereoscopic vision), leading them to suspect that the Chtorrans mutated the bunnydogs out of some previous stock. It is also mentioned that recon missions into gastropede mandalas have found eggs for millipedes, jellypigs, snufflers, and gorps‚Äîbut no mention has been made of bunnydog/libbit eggs. * Meeps: These are red furballs, ranging in size from tennis ball to bowling ball in diameter. Like another alien fuzzball envisioned by Gerrold, they reproduce very quickly, and possess many traits which induce adoration in other species. In the wild, mother animals of many species will actually abandon their young in order to take care of meeps‚Äîa potent adaptation indeed. Some scientists speculate that the bunnydogs essentially rely on the same tactic as the meeps in a sense: they are so disarmingly cute, literally resembling living teddy bears, that humans are reluctant to attack them. *Nightstalkers: vaguely insectoid creatures which resemble large bats with cloaks, and of roughly similar size to larger bats and birds of prey. They have a similar ecological niche to birds of prey, primarily eating insects but also smaller rodents. *Kites: As the name implies, they resemble large living kites. The size of eagles, they fulfill a similar ecological niche as a flying apex predator, preying on Nightstalkers just as eagles prey on lesser birds. *Vampires: A very bizarre creature, essentially resembling a living tarp or translucent blanket fluttering in the wind. It eventually falls on large creatures (often cattle but also humans), and drains them of blood to feed, hence their name. These feedings aren't necessarily fatal but frequently are due to severe blood loss. * God-Bees‚Äî What comes after the worms. Chtorran plants Some Chtorran life-forms are similar to plants or fungi, but many are carnivorous plants, or mobile animal-plant hybrids which defy easy categorization. * Shambler Trees: Chtorran trees that act as hosts to countless separate species of predatory creatures identified as \\"tenants\\". The trees are mobile, able to cover up to a half mile a day and leaving a root network of \\"tickler nerves\\" in their path. The \\"tickler nerves\\" alert a tree to approaching prey, which triggers the tenants to swarm and feed. Once the tenants eat their fill, the prey's remains will fertilize the root network. Ultimately, the trees become a Clonal colony or \\"Shambler Grove\\". At an undetermined point in their growth, a shambler grove may permanently stop in one area and grow a sort of womb beneath their roots where all the different Chtorran species will emerge. McCarthy theorized that the Chtorrans came to Earth by shambler seeds, which contains the DNA of every Chtorran lifeform. They are a complex and key element of Chtorran ecology on Earth, essentially acting as factories which can produce all of the other species after making planetfall‚Äîthough subsequently species like the worms are capable of reproducing on their own without the shambler groves. * Manna plants: Small pink fungi that can rapidly blanket an area. During some seasons, the plant dries out and becomes brittle and powdery. It will dissipate when touched into powdery strands. The strands of many plants clump together into puffballs which can grow to enormous sized. Eventually, the puffballs explode into a fine powder compared to cotton candy. This creates a storm of powder that lasts about a week, during which the lower Chtorran fauna come out to feed and reproduce, which is then echoed all the way up the food chain. Most Earth animals and plants will die in a puffball storm, and humans will easily get lost and overwhelmed. They are perhaps the most subtly dangerous lifeform in the Chtorran ecosystem; the powder destroys machinery, as it is not only flammable, but (like grain dust) fine enough to act as a thermobaric weapon. The powder is every bit as hazardous to terrestrial animals as it is filled with Chtorran bacteria; exposure to it quickly results in an equivalent of Legionellosis known as \\"pink lung\\" that is 100% fatal within days of exposure without state-of-the-art treatment. As basic mushroom-like fungi in their simpler stages, scientists suspect that manna plants were among the first Cthorran life-forms to appear on Earth, acting as primary plant growth which established groundwork conditions for other Chtorran life forms birthed out of the shambler tree wombs. Retroactive analysis confirmed that there were reports of manna plants (thought to just be a new kind of fungus) years before the wave of plagues hit in the initial invasion. * Red Kudzu: Similar to the terrestrial plant, but red in color. This plant ranges from jet black to pink, red, violet, and orange. It grows extremely quickly and can cover an entire town in weeks. Its greatest danger is in its ability to shelter Chtorran predatory life‚Äîattempts to control its spread through napalm strikes are negated in days by further growth, but massive numbers of human remains have been found before it reclaims the scorched ground. All attempts to destroy it have failed, and it appears to be resistant to all known poisons. Red kudzu exists in a symbiotic, or at least mutualistic, relationship with shamble tree groves: the red kudzu grows in shambler branches and uses it for transport across large distances, and in return, the red kudzu provides the shambler and its tenant creatures with shade from the sun and predators. This is not true symbiosis: the red kudzu can potentially envelop a shambler to the point that it is immobilized and dies (particularly younger ones), but the shambler tenants regularly eat the red kudzu. In a delicate balance, the tenants eat just enough of the red kudzu to keep it from immobilizing the shambler grove, but without outright killing off the red kudzu. * Sea sludge: A red algae-like organism that spreads across the surface of water, much like a Terran algae bloom‚Äîbut on a massive scale. Locally, the red algae is relatively harmless‚Äîthough humans and animals who swallow water containing it will suffer violent nausea and diarrhea‚Äîbut on a global scale it is perhaps the single most destructive Chtorran organism of all. The oily sludge it secretes kills off surrounding Terran plankton and algae, thus starving to death all Terran sea life within (from fish up to larger sharks and whales). Sea sludge spread so fast that even a few years after the plagues it had already overrun most of the world's oceans, destroying virtually the entire marine biosphere. *Wormberries: An important part of the gastropedes' diet, which stingflies lay their larvae on. The fact that gastropedes continue to eat them despite the constant presence of stingfly larva implies that they are a keystone element in the gastropedes' nutritional needs. Humans can safely eat wormberries‚Äîif grown in isolation so no stingfly larva are present. They are actually a good source of Vitamin C, though they are said to have an odd taste described as a cross between \\"cherries and sauerkraut\\". * Shrike-vines: A rubbery mass of coiled vines covered in spikes which is capable of movement on its own, somewhat like a venus flytrap, but more of an animal/plant hybrid. Shrike-vines are ambush predators that are frequently encountered as \\"tenants\\" in shambler tree groves, though they can also appear independently from them. * Revelation flowers: Blue and red flowers that, when ingested, put a person into a state of intense euphoria. People undergoing \\"Revelations\\" view Chtorran flora and fauna as beautiful, and seek to become part of it. They are often used by the renegade humans to somehow understand Chtorrans. * Land coral: Much like Terran coral, they are actually colonies of small animals that build reef-like structures: towering edifices which can reach 20 meters high and several miles long. Land coral is tougher than granite and halts the progress of human vehicles, from bulldozers to treaded tanks. For that matter, they are so tough that even the gastropedes cannot simply tear through them. * Lizard-grass: Alive, lizard-grass is a relatively harmless blue-green grass which can grow eight inches high. After the plant dies, however, the dried leaves become razor-sharp and dangerous to walk through. Vast swaths of the North American Great Plains and Eurasian Steppe have been subsumed by lizard-grass as far as the eye can see. First and second editions There are two distinctly different editions of the first two books in this series. The first edition was released in 1983 by Timescape Books. This edition was edited by the publisher and removed several items which they objected to. All of the chapter introductions (the \\"Solomon Short\\" quotations) and several pages of homosexual content were removed. The same thing was done to the 1984 release of A Day for Damnation. In 1989, David Gerrold made a new publishing contract with Bantam Books. This time, both A Matter for Men and A Day for Damnation were released with all redacted content restored. Connections to other Gerrold works Many characters and ideas from other works by David Gerrold have made appearances in this series. Amongst them are H.A.R.L.I.E. (from the book When HARLIE Was One), tribbles (from Star Trek, disguised as Meeps), and the Space Elevator (from the book Bouncing Off the Moon). The reverse is also true‚Äîthere are references to the series in other Gerrold novels. In Bouncing Off the Moon, there is a mention of a woman in Oregon claiming that a giant worm ate her horse, along with numerous passages about plagues spreading across the Earth, also suggesting that the two stories take place in the same story universe. References to the series also appear in the Star Wolf novels, such as Chtorrans proper and a self-help guru named Daniel Jeffrey Foreman, suggesting the two series exist in the same universe. In Gerrold's 1977 novel Moonstar Odyssey, there is a reference to \\"Chtorr-plants\\" \\"...named for the legendary place of child-eating demons from which they were supposed to have come\\" and having an alternate form of photosynthesis. Reference to the Chtorr or Chtorr-like species and situations also pop-up in Gerrold's 1993 book Under the Eye of God and its 1994 sequel A Covenant of Justice. In his Star Trek novel, The Galactic Whirlpool, Gerrold quotes the \\"Terran philosopher, Solomon Short\\" as saying, \\"This neurotic pursuit of sanity is driving us all crazy.\\" Naming of characters For Season for Slaughter, Gerrold named several characters after actual people, who donated handsomely to Gerrold's favorite charities for the privilege (\\"tuckerization\\"). Gerrold had not thought to repeat the effort, but as work on Method for Madness progressed, he received so many fan inquiries about \\"buying a character\\" that he decided to do it again. Prior to that, In A Rage For Revenge, Gerrold included several characters, particularly children who were fated to be eaten by worms, named after friends he had made when attending his first UK Star Trek conventions.

A Democrat, he served in the United States House of Representatives for eight terms, from 1965 to 1971 and from 1975 to 1985. Early years Richard Lawrence Ottinger was born in New York City, the son of businessman Lawrence Ottinger, founder of U.S. Plywood, and nephew of Albert Ottinger, the Republican Attorney General of New York from 1925 to 1928. He attended the public schools of Scarsdale, New York and graduated from the Loomis School, in Windsor, Connecticut in 1946. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Cornell University in 1950 and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1953. He also studied international law at Georgetown University. He served in the United States Air Force from 1955 to 1957, and was discharged as a captain. He was admitted to the New York bar and practiced international and corporate law. He was one of the founders and the second staff member of the Peace Corps, serving as director of programs for the west coast of South America from 1961 to 1964. Political career 1969, Congressional Pictorial Directory In the 1964 elections, he was elected as a Democrat to the 89th United States Congress and was re-elected twice in 1966 and 1968. After the 1964 run, Ottinger was criticized for using a loophole in election laws to spend $193,000 of his own money to get around a limit of $8,000 in the race. He set up multiple committees and gave money of all of them. Most prominently, Ottinger's mother, Louise, and sister, Patricia Heath, had set up 22 different committees that in turn donated $6,000 apiece to his campaign.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JkMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=PuYFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5033,7852131&dq;=richard- ottinger&hl;=en In the 1970 elections, he gave up his House seat to run on the Democratic ticket for United States Senator from New York. In the 1970 election, Ottinger split the liberal vote with the Republican (and Liberal- endorsed) nominee, incumbent Senator Charles Goodell (who was appointed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller after the assassination of Senator Robert F.

In 1972, he sought to return to his old congressional seat, but lost in a hotly contested election to the Republican incumbent Representative Peter A. Peyser. His comeback effort was successful in 1974, when he was elected to the House from a different district. He was re-elected to the four succeeding Congresses (in 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1982), retiring in 1985.

Clyde Engineering derivatives An ex Commonwealth Railways CL class leads a GM class locomotive in Australia. In 1951, the EMD F7 series was modified by General Motors' Australian licence holder Clyde Engineering to fit Australian loading gauge and axle load constraints. The A1A-A1A Clyde/EMD ML1 locomotive was introduced on the Commonwealth Railways as the GM class, as well as exported to Pakistan.Oberg, p. 251 It was further developed into the ML2 as a dual cab Co-Co locomotive, with a bulldog nose at each end, for Victorian Railways (VR), becoming that system's B class.Oberg, p.264 A single-nose variant of the design, the EMD A7, with the revised EMD 567C series engine, was introduced as the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) 42 class, the VR S class, and an upgraded GM class. The design continued to be developed with the dual-cab EMD AJ16C, introduced on NSWGR as the 421 class, although, unlike the earlier ML2, the bulldog nose was only used on one end of the locomotives. 1970 saw the introduction of the last new locomotive design in the world to utilise the F-series bulldog nose, the EMD AT26C, designated by the Commonwealth Railways as the CL class.Oberg, p.360 A final Australian iteration of the bulldog nose in Australian locomotive practice was the rebuild of the 30-year-old Victorian ML2 units into the EMD AAT22C-2R, designated as the V/Line A class.

The fair generally begins two weeks after the Semana Santa, or Easter Holy Week. The fair officially begins at midnight on Saturday, and runs seven days, ending on the following Saturday. Each day the fiesta begins with the parade of carriages and riders, at midday, carrying Seville's leading citizens which make their way to the bullring, La Real Maestranza, where the bullfighters and breeders meet. For the duration of the fair, the fairgrounds and a vast area on the far bank of the Guadalquivir River are totally covered in rows of casetas (individual decorated marquee tents which are temporarily built on the fairground). These casetas usually belong to prominent families of Seville, groups of friends, clubs, trade associations and political parties. From around nine at night until six or seven the following morning, at first in the streets and later only within each caseta, there are crowds partying and dancing sevillanas, drinking Sherry, manzanilla or rebujito, and eating tapas.http://www.cyberspain.com/life/seville.htm Cyberspain This fair also has an amusement park that comes with it and has many games to play along with roller coasters to ride.  History  Carriage at the Seville's April Fair The Fair dates back to 1846 when it was originally organized as a livestock fair by two councillors born in Northern Spain, Basque Jos√© Mar√≠a Ybarra and Catalan Narciso Bonaplata. Queen Isabel II agreed to the proposal, and on 18 April 1847 the first fair was held at the Prado de San Sebastian, on the outskirts of the city. It took only one year before an air of festivity began to transform the fair, due mainly to the emergence of the first three casetas, belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Montpensier, the Town Hall, and the Casino of Seville. During the 1920s, the fair reached its peak and became the spectacle that it is today.  Location  Since 1973, the Feria de Abril takes place at the Real de la Feria, an area of 24 blocks (450,000 m2) which is located between Los Remedios and Tablada. In 2012 there were 1048 casetas. The streets of the Real are named after famous bullfighters such as Juan Belmonte and Pascual M√°rquez. Next to the Real is the Calle del Infierno (Hell Road), an amusement park which offers many recreational activities; a circus is usually set furthest from the Real on the back of the Parque de los Pr√≠ncipes. Construction of the portada (the main gate) starts months in advance, and it takes several weeks to clear the place after the end of the fair. Street plan of Feria de Abril de Sevilla Plans to relocate the Fair to the Charco de la Pava have existed for the past 20 years, but the local government is yet to present any plans to transform the Real. For years the Charco de la Pava has been used as the main parking lot for fair attendees.  Pesca√≠to  The main entrance to the Seville Fair of 2012, five minutes after the alumbrao. Saturday night in the Feria de Abril is referred to as la noche del pesca√≠to (night of the fish) due to the fact that fish is the traditional dish to have for dinner. Celebrations officially start at midnight between Saturday and Sunday when the lights of the portada are turned on. This event is called the alumbrao. People gather in front of the portada to watch the alumbrao and then go to the casetas to have dinner and spend the whole night at the Real.  Future fair dates  The 2020 Feria de Abril was scheduled from April 25th to May 2nd. However, on March 15th 2020 the fair was postponed to September due to the coronavirus pandemic in Spain.

Such codes were introduced by Valerii Denisovich Goppa. In particular cases, they can have interesting extremal properties. They should not be confused with binary Goppa codes that are used, for instance, in the McEliece cryptosystem. Construction Traditionally, an AG-code is constructed from a non-singular projective curve X over a finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_q by using a number of fixed distinct \\\\mathbb{F}_q-rational points on \\\\mathbf{X}: :\\\\mathcal{P}:= {P_1, \\\\ldots, P_n } \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{X} (\\\\mathbb{F}_q). Let G be a divisor on X, with a support that consists of only rational points and that is disjoint from the P_i. Thus \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\cap \\\\operatorname{supp}(G) = \\\\varnothing By the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, there is a unique finite-dimensional vector space, L(G), with respect to the divisor G. The vector space is a subspace of the function field of X. There are two main types of AG-codes that can be constructed using the above information.  Function code  The function code (or dual code) with respect to a curve X, a divisor G and the set \\\\mathcal{P} is constructed as follows. Let D = P_1 + \\\\cdots + P_n, be a divisor, with the P_i defined as above. We usually denote a Goppa code by C(D,G). We now know all we need to define the Goppa code: :C(D, G) = \\\\left { \\\\left (f(P_1), \\\\ldots, f(P_n) \\\\right ) \\\\ : \\\\ f \\\\in L(G) \\\\right } \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n For a fixed basis f_1, \\\\ldots, f_k for L(G) over \\\\mathbb{F}_q, the corresponding Goppa code in \\\\mathbb{F}_q^n is spanned over \\\\mathbb{F}_q by the vectors :\\\\left (f_i(P_1), \\\\ldots, f_i(P_n) \\\\right ) Therefore, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_1(P_1) & \\\\cdots & f_1(P_n) \\\\ \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\ f_k(P_1) & \\\\cdots & f_k(P_n) \\\\end{bmatrix} is a generator matrix for C(D, G). Equivalently, it is defined as the image of :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\alpha : L(G) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}^n \\\\ f \\\\mapsto (f(P_1), \\\\ldots ,f(P_n)) \\\\end{cases} The following shows how the parameters of the code relate to classical parameters of linear systems of divisors D on C (cf. Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem for more). The notation ‚Ñì(D) means the dimension of L(D). :Proposition A. The dimension of the Goppa code C(D, G) is k = \\\\ell(G) - \\\\ell(G-D). Proof. Since C(D,G) \\\\cong L(G)/\\\\ker(\\\\alpha), we must show that :\\\\ker(\\\\alpha)=L(G-D). Let f \\\\in \\\\ker(\\\\alpha) then f(P_1)=\\\\cdots=f(P_n) =0 so \\\\operatorname{div}(f) > D . Thus, f \\\\in L(G-D). Conversely, suppose f \\\\in L(G-D), then \\\\operatorname{div}(f)> D since :P_i < G, \\\\quad i=1, \\\\ldots ,n. (G doesn't ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problems with the -D, so f must do that instead.) It follows that f(P_1)=\\\\cdots = f(P_n) = 0. :Proposition B. The minimal distance between two code words is d \\\\geqslant n - \\\\deg(G). Proof. Suppose the Hamming weight of \\\\alpha(f) is d. That means that for n-d indices i_1, \\\\ldots, i_{n-d} we havef(P_{i_k})=0 for k \\\\in {1, \\\\ldots, n-d}. Then f \\\\in L(G-P_{i_1} - \\\\cdots - P_{i_{n-d}}), and :\\\\operatorname{div}(f)+G-P_{i_1} - \\\\cdots - P_{i_{n-d}}> 0. Taking degrees on both sides and noting that :\\\\deg(\\\\operatorname{div}(f))=0, we get :\\\\deg(G)-(n-d) \\\\geqslant 0. so :d \\\\geq n - \\\\deg(G).  Residue code  The residue code can be defined as the dual of the function code, or as the residue of some functions at the P_i's.

(1916) The Cayuga Press, Ithaca, N.Y. Early life Sage was born in Middletown, Connecticut on January 31, 1814. He was the son of Charles and Sally (n√©e Williams) Sage. He spent part of his early childhood in Bristol, Connecticut before moving to Ithaca, New York in 1827. Two uncles, Timothy S. Williams and Josiah B. Williams, were New York State Senators from the Ithaca area. Career After briefly studying medicine at Ithaca under Dr. Austin Church, he began work for his uncles' forwarding firm, with a line of barges on the Erie Canal, which he took over by 1837. In 1847, he was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Whig.The Honorable Henry W. Sage, Cornell University, pp. 681‚Äì686 In 1854, he purchased a tract of land at Bell Ewart on Lake Simcoe, 51 miles north of Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was soon processing timber on a large scale. From that point, the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad (see Northern Railway of Canada) carried the lumber to its wharves in Toronto, offering Sage a reduced rate for a specified number of carloads per month. The lumber was shipped across Lake Ontario to Sage's wholesale lumber yards at Albany, New York. He did not own the timber lands on Lake Simcoe, but rather purchased logs from farmers eager to clear their lands. Dedication cornerstone on Sage Chapel at Cornell Moving to Brooklyn in 1857, he became active in the Plymouth Congregational Church, where the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher (son of Lyman Beecher and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe) was pastor. He would later endow the Lyman Beecher Lectureship on Preaching at Yale Divinity School. About this time he was also purchasing lumber in Michigan, as the Ontario supply began to wane. In 1863, he became a business partner with John McGraw. The two founded the town of Wenona, Michigan (named for the mother of Hiawatha and now part of Bay City) in 1864. The two earned a fortune in lumber and land in Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. In 1865, Sage purchased timber berths in Oakley township, Muskoka, necessary to keep the Bell Ewart mill running. The construction of a canal was required to run the logs from the Black River to Lake Couchiching. With previous experience on the New York State Assembly and legislation involving improvements to the Erie Canal, he attracted the interest of other Lake Simcoe lumbermen to form the Rama Timber Transport Company in 1868. The canal to divert the logs into Lake Couchiching opened in 1869, later that year Sage sold the Bell Ewart mill and associated timber berths to Messrs. Silliman and Beecher. Young Harry Beecher was a nephew of Sage's pastor, Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. He funded construction of what is now the Sage Library of the Bay County Library System in Michigan in 1884. It was designed by Cornell architecture professor Charles Babcock in the French Ch√¢teau-style, and is today a historical landmark.  Involvement with Cornell  Sage College for Women, now Sage Hall Sage Chapel. plaque on Uris Library Henry Sage attended the inauguration of Cornell University on October 7, 1868. On this occasion Sage was introduced to Andrew Dickson White by their mutual friend John McGraw. As recounted by White in his Autobiography, Sage told White, \\"I believe you are right in regard to admitting women ... when you are ready to move in the matter, let me know.\\" Within a year, White had admitted Cornell's first female student, but since the University had only all-male dormitories, she was forced to rent a room in downtown Ithaca. This required a steep climb several times per day, which became treacherous in winter. White went to ask Sage for assistance, and Sage responded with an offer of $250,000 to build a women's college. In 1870, Sage was elected to the Board of Trustees of Cornell University, and elected president of the Board in 1875. At his direction, the University resisted selling its Wisconsin land grants in the aftermath of the Panic of 1873, earning millions of dollars for the university's endowment. An avowed supporter of equal access to higher education, he established Sage College for Women, Cornell's first residence for female students (today known as Sage Hall and home to the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management). He also built Sage Chapel, the first non-denominational house of worship at a US university (and later endowed by his son Dean Sage); Sage House, now home to the Cornell University Press; the Sage Infirmary, now known as Schuyler House; and Stimson Hall, original home of the Cornell Medical College in Ithaca. He endowed the Susan Linn Sage School of Philosophy in the College of Arts and Sciences, named after his wife. Sage's most notable contribution was the construction of the University Library (since 1962, Uris Library). Jennie McGraw, who had inherited his partner John's fortune in 1877, and died of tuberculosis shortly after marrying University Librarian Daniel Willard Fiske. She bequeathed $1 million to build a library, but Fiske sued to break the will, sparking what became known as The Great Will Case. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Fiske's favor in 1890. Infuriated by the decision, Sage donated funds for the construction of the Library himself, including a large plaque memorializing his indignation: :The good she tried to do shall stand as if 'twere done :GOD finishes the work by noble souls begun. :In loving memory of JENNIE MCGRAW FISKE whose purpose to :found a great library for Cornell University has been defeated :this house is built and endowed by her friend :HENRY W.

William Linn who served as the first Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives in 1789. Together, they were the parents of: * Dean Sage (1841‚Äì1902), who endowed the Sage Lecture, a sermon series at Sage Chapel. * William Henry Sage (1844‚Äì1924), who graduated from Yale University in 1865 and would later fund the construction of Yale's Sage Hall, named for William's son DeWitt Linn Sage, in 1923. Himself later a Cornell trustee, William Sage also funded the construction of Percy Field, Cornell's original football field, as well as the stone arch bridge over Cascadilla Gorge. His wife was killed in 1885 when she was thrown from her carriage in Ithaca. Sage died in Ithaca, New York on September 18, 1897. Descendants His grandson Dean, named after the son, became president of Presbyterian Hospital in 1922, which affiliated with Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1924.

It is a Grade I listed building. History It was one of several terraces and crescents around Regent's Park designed by the British architect John Nash (1752‚Äì1835), under the patronage of the Prince Regent (later George IV). The terrace was to stand opposite the Prince's proposed palace in the park and was therefore of particular importance in the scheme. It was named after the Prince Regent's uncle the Duke of Cumberland (King George III's younger brother), later King of Hanover. The Terrace was built by William Mountford Nurse, with James Thomson serving as resident architect, and was completed in 1826. It consists of three main blocks, linked by decorative arches with typical neoclassical style and grandeur. The central block includes a large sculptural pediment by J. G. Bubb above a long colonnade of Ionic columns. Originally comprising 31 houses which were entirely reconstructed behind the original fa√ßade in the 1960s, some have been converted into flats but many houses are still separate family homes. The first resident, William Mountford Nurse himself, moved into the terrace in 1828; the building was not fully occupied until 1836.

War service=Early history 1941-42 Aconite was built by Ailsa Shipbuilding Company Ltd at Troon in Scotland, and was commissioned on 19 July 1941, under Lieutenant de vaisseau Levasseur. She was attached to the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL) on 23 July 1941, and assigned to the Clyde escort group on 17 August 1941, joining the Newfoundland Forces. Aconit took a very active part in the Battle of the Atlantic for two years, protecting convoys sailing from Newfoundland to the U.K. via Iceland. She also took part to the operations in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon between 10 and 27 December 1941.

The senior surviving officer of Harvester, Lieutenant J L Briggs (who had been gunnery control officer) interviewed the second-in- command of U-432, who had launched both torpedoes: \\"Why did you need to fire the second torpedo so shallow? What did you want to do, kill as many as you could?\\" The oberleutnant replied \\"didn't think you were sinking fast enough.\\" To the war's end 1943-45 From 1 to 12 April, Aconit undertook repairs in Glasgow. On 21 April 1943, at Greenock, General Charles de Gaulle came aboard and awarded the corvette and her commander the Croix de la Lib√©ration. Under major repairs from 1 September to 10 October 1943, her commander was replaced by Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Miller. She rejoined the Battle of the Atlantic, attacking a German submarine on 13 December 1943. Aconit spent the first months of 1944 in Casablanca and Gibraltar, and on 5 June 1944 she escorted the convoy U-3 from Torbay to France, coming under attack from German airplanes. During the Normandy landings, she was attached to the 108th escort group, along with Free French ships Aventure, Escarmouche and Renoncule. Two German prisoners from one of the U-boats sunk by the French corvette Aconit on 14 March 1943. She last fired in anger on 11 April 1945. On 18 April, she undertook minor repairs, and returned to escorting convoys in May, until 5 June 1945, the official date for the end of naval operations in European waters. Post war Aconit was briefly used by the French naval school, before being given back to the Royal Navy on 30 April 1947 and renamed HMS Aconite. In July 1947 the ship was sold to United Whalers, London, for whaling purposes. Rebuilt as buoy boat (towing vessel) by Harland & Wolff, Belfast, she was delivered in November as Terje 11 to serve the whaling factory Balaena. The company used a second corvette as Terje 10 (the former ) In summer 1951 she was converted in a whale catcher with an ice strengthened bow and worked with Balaena until the company gave up whaling at the end of the 1959/1960 season. In August 1960 the Scottish company Christian Salvesen, with still five former Flower corvettes in service, purchased Terje 11 and renamed the whale catcher Southern Terrier . She worked three seasons with the whaling factory Southern Harvester. She became chartered for her last catching season 1963/1964 by Anders Jahre's A/S Kosmos and worked for the factory ship Kosmos IV, the former German Walter Rau. Laid up in Norway 1964 she was sold for scrapping to Belgium, where she arrived in January 1967. Legacy In honour of this unit, three French warships have since been named Aconit including the modern stealth frigate .

Vinge. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1981, and was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1981. Based on the 1844 fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, The Snow Queen takes place on a mostly oceanic planet called Tiamat. Tiamat's suns orbit a black hole, which facilitates interstellar wormhole travel and connects Tiamat to the rest of the civilized galaxy (the \\"Hegemony\\", the remnants of a fallen Galactic Empire). Premise The Galactic Empire, which once ruled large portions of the galaxy, fell into decay millennia ago. Its remnants coalesced into a group of seven planets known as the Hegemony. Though the Hegemony has large-scale interstellar travel and high technology, it has not yet returned to the Empire's level of technological prowess. Tiamat is an oceanic planet, accessible to the Hegemony only through wormhole travel. The gravitational pull of Tiamat's twin suns influence the \\"Black Gate\\". It only remains open for cycles of 150 years; when it is closed, no offworld travelers are able to reach Tiamat for more than a century. The residents of Tiamat are split into two clans: \\"Winters\\", who advocate technological progress and trade with offworlders, and \\"Summers\\", who depend on their folk traditions and rigid social distinctions for survival. Every 150 years, control of Tiamat's government switches between Winter rule and Summer rule. Interstellar travel between Tiamat and the Hegemony is only possible during the 150 years of Winter rule, and a single woman rules the entire planet: a \\"Snow Queen\\" in Winter, a \\"Summer Queen\\" in Summer. During the Change, or transition of power, the former queen is ritually executed and replaced by her successor in order to avoid open conflict. The Hegemony's interest in Tiamat lies in mers, a species of sea-dwelling creatures whose blood contains a virus that halts the aging process. Mers are hunted as frequently as possible during the Winter years. The \\"water of life\\" produced from their blood allows for virtual immortality. A single Snow Queen reigns for the entire 150-year season. During Winter rule, offworlders bring technology to Tiamat in exchange for the water of life. At the end of Winter, they leave Tiamat and destroy all high technology, leaving Summers to rule under an agrarian lifestyle. In this way, they exploit Tiamat and prevent it from developing the technology to rebel. Plot summary Arienrhod, the Snow Queen, has secretly implanted several Summer women with clones of herself, in the hopes of extending her rule past her ritual execution at the end of Winter. Moon Dawntreader Summer is the only one of these clones to survive to adolescence. She and her cousin Sparks are lovers. Moon becomes a sibyl, a position of high status among the Summer people. Sibyls are both feared and revered; they possess the ability to answer any question by going into a trance state. Sibyls believe that they receive visions from the Lady, a sea goddess. Sparks is not chosen to become a sibyl. Angry at Moon for joining the sibyls without him and curious about his offworld heritage, he travels to Carbuncle, Tiamat's capital. He is immediately caught up by Arienrhod and eventually becomes the \\"Starbuck\\", the Snow Queen's consort and commander of the mer hunts. Moon receives a message, apparently from Sparks, urging her to come to Carbuncle, though sibyls may not legally enter the city. On her way, she becomes entangled with smugglers and is taken offworld. This is normally a one way trip for a Tiamatan citizen. Hegemony law prevents any native Tiamatian from returning after leaving the planet, fearing that travelers would realize how Tiamat is being exploited and use this knowledge to foment rebellion. Arienrhod is crushed; she had planned to draw Moon to Carbuncle and make her the next Summer Queen. Moon was supposed to reject the Summer fear of technology and develop resistance to the Hegemony during the next Summer reign. Arienrhod devises a backup plan; she will unleash a plague at the Change which will kill most Summers and spare most Winters, allowing Tiamat to continue its technological growth before the Hegemony returns. Moon is taken to the capital planet, Kharemough, and discovers that the Winters' prejudice against sibyls is a political tool used by the Hegemony to preserve its control of technology on Tiamat. Sibyls are highly respected throughout the other planets of the Hegemony; only on Tiamat, due to a careful reinforcement of superstitions during the reign of Winter, are they considered dangerous and mentally unstable. The sibyls are actually part of a data network devised by the Old Empire as a way to rebuild society more quickly after the Empire's fall. Sibyls have the ability to communicate with a vast electronic databank, which explains their ability to answer seemingly unknowable questions. Moon learns from another sibyl that Sparks is in danger, and returns to Tiamat illegally. Due to time dilation, five years pass on Tiamat while Moon is only gone for a period of weeks. After a crash landing and short sojourn as a captive of Winter outlaws, Moon returns to Carbuncle and confronts Arienrhod. Arienrhod's plan to unleash the plague is foiled, but Moon is chosen to become the next Summer Queen. She prepares Tiamat to face the Hegemony as a peer when the 150 years of summer end and interstellar travel is again possible through the black hole.  Sequels  Vinge wrote a sequel to The Snow Queen called The Summer Queen (1991), with a novella, World's End (1984), linking the two. A third novel, Tangled Up In Blue, was published in 2000. Critical reception Vinge‚Äôs novel was well received when it initially came out. Reviewers have admired the complex world- building Vinge created with the planet of Tiamat and the Hegemony calling it a ‚Äúcarefully crafted universe‚Äù and ‚Äúimpeccable and expansive‚Äù. Reaction to the characters and plot have been mixed. Some reviewers have seen the characters as ‚Äúdistinctive and believable‚Äù while other reviewers have felt the characters too casual. The plot has been called ‚Äúfast-paced and eventful‚Äù and ‚Äúthe kind of book that felt much shorter than the 500-odd pages in spans‚Äù but also frustrating as ‚Äúthe love story holds very few surprises\\" being based on the Hans Christian Andersen story. Some have said the book ‚Äúfeels before its time‚Äù.  Translations  * Russian: ', 1995, 2003.

It is the only species currently recognized in the monotypic genus Tetracapsuloides. It is the cause of Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD), one of the most serious parasitic diseases of salmonid populations in Europe and North America that can result in losses of up to 90% in infected populations. Taxonomy Until the late 1990s, the organism which caused PKD was enigmatic, thus called PKX organism. The causative agent of PKD was recognized as a form of Malacosporean, but the absence of mature spores in salmonid hosts, the lack of fish to fish transmission, and seasonality of the disease suggested that the life cycle of PKX was completed in another host and that infection of salmonids could be accidental. Korotneff observed a myxozoan in the bryozoan, Plumatella fungosa, in 1892, which he described as Myxosporidium bryozoides. Myxozoan infection of bryozoans was not reported again until 1996. Ecological investigations of freshwater bryozoans in North America discovered parasitic sacs of a myxozoan species, freely floating in the body cavities of several bryozoans. Molecular analyses indicated that the 18S rDNA sequences of these sacs were indistinguishable from those of PKX. The PKX organism was scientifically described as Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae Canning, Curry, Feist, Longshaw & Okamura 1999, which was assigned to a new class, the Malacosporea within the phylum Myxozoa. Around the same time, another group described the PKX organism from Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, as Tetracapsuloides renicola Kent, Khattra, Hedrick & Devlin 2000, but the first given name has priority according to the rules of the binomial nomenclature. Life cycle T. bryosalmonae has a two-host life cycle, as other myxosporeans, cycling between freshwater bryozoa and salmonid fish species, rather than an oligochaete or polychaete worm as for Myxobolus cerebralis. To date, T. bryosalmonae has been found to parasitize at last five freshwater bryozoans Phylactolaemata species belonging to the genera Fredericella and Plumatella, all considered to be primitive genera. Infected bryozoans release mature T. bryosalmonae malacospores during overt infections when large spore sacs are freely floating within their coelomic cavity . Bryozoan dispersal strategies, including colony fragmentation, statoblast dispersal and the formation of migrating zooids allow their colonization of new habitats and the spreading of infective T. bryosalmonae stages . Pathology Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by a swollen kidney and spleen, bloody ascites, and pale gills, indicating the fish becomes anemic at the late stage of the disease. Note that those symptoms are common amongst many other fish diseases and do not specifically indicate an infection with Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. It is important to clarify the pathologic condition only happens in species particularly susceptible, or na√Øve, to T. bryosalmonae. In those cases, the parasite is allowed to cross the renal tubules wall to proliferate within the interstitial tissue of kidney (=histozoic proliferation). This proliferation stage is a dead end for the parasite (=extrasporogonic proliferation) but instead causes a tumultuous tumour-like tissue reaction in the kidney, inducing a chronic lymphoid hyperplasia marked by a strong parasite-driven immunosuppressant pathogenesis and a dysregulation of T-helper subsets . In advanced pathology stages, this chronic lymphoid hyperplasia causes the development of granulomatous-like lesions, thus resulting in the characteristic swelling of the whole kidney. Distribution T. bryosalmonae has been recorded in Europe and North America. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences revealed a clade composed of all North American sequences plus a subset of Italian and French sequences. High genetic diversity in North America and the absence of genotypes which are characteristic of the North American clade in the rest of Europe implies that southern Europe was colonized by immigration from North America; however, sequence divergence suggests that this colonization substantially pre-dated human movements of fish. Furthermore, the lack of southern European lineages in the rest of Europe, despite widespread rainbow trout farming, indicates that T. bryosalmonae is not transported through fisheries activities. This result contrasts with the commonness of fisheries-related introductions of other pathogens and parasites such as Myxobolus cerebralis and Ceratomyxa shasta. PKD is a serious immunopathology causing a high mortality rate, thus with a relevant economic impact for trout aquaculture in Europe and North America.

He succeeded his father-in- law to High Meadow in 1714. Under a marriage settlement dated 3 October 1713, he married Benedicta Maria Theresa Hall, daughter and heiress of Henry Benedict Hall of High Meadow, Gloucestershire and his wife Frances Fortescue. He converted to the Church of England in 1715, perhaps to enable him to sit in parliament.Alden (1948), pp. 5,8 Career Gage was elected Member of Parliament for Minehead at a by-election on 11 April 1717, but was unseated on petition on 23 May 1717. On 14 September 1720, King George I created him Baron Gage of Castlebar in the county of Mayo, and Viscount Gage of Castle Island in the county of Kerry of the Kingdom of Ireland. Although styled as Viscount and eligible to sit in the Irish House of Lords, this did not prevent him from sitting in the British House of Commons. In 1719 he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company which commissioned numerous works from Handel and others.Thomas McGeary. The Politics of Opera in Handel's Britain. Cambridge University Press, 2013. p. 254 Gage was elected MP for Tewkesbury at a by-election on 25 October 1721 and was elected again at the 1722 general election. In his first session of this parliament, he made several speeches against the special tax on Papists. In April 1727 he spoke for the motion for a vote of credit. He was returned again at the 1727 general election. He exposed the fraudulent sale of the Derwentwater estates on 31 March 1732, and was subsequently rewarded with ¬£2,000 for this under the Greenwich Hospital Act 1735.Statutes at Large (1758 edition) V, 8 Geo. II, c.29. At the 1734 general election, he was returned again as MP for Tewkesbury. He introduced a bill to prevent clandestine marriages, in 1736, but it was rejected. In 1738, it was rumoured that he was to be appointed as Governor of Barbados, but the appointment was never materialised, probably because he lacked sufficient political connections.Alden (1948), p. 6 He went into opposition with Pulteney and the Patriot Whigs in 1739, but in February 1741, he was one of the opposition Whigs who withdrew on the motion for Walpole's removal. He was returned to parliament again at the 1741 general election. Firle Place from rear On 23 April 1744, his cousin, Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet, died without children, and Gage inherited the baronetcy and the family estate of Firle Place. Sir William's late father was Gage's uncle - Sir John Gage, 4th Baronet, Sheriff of Sussex. The main line of the family, up to the 7th Baronet, had been Roman Catholic recusants who had purchased their baronetcy from King James I, and Gage quietly resumed practising Roman Catholicism, although his children were raised in the Church of England. At the 1747 general election, he was returned again for Tewkesbury and joined the opposition. In 1747 was appointed Steward of the Household of Frederick, Prince of Wales and held the post until 1751. Later life Gage's wife died on 25 July 1749, and on 26 December 1750 he married secondly Jane Godfrey, a Gloucestershire heiress.Alden (1948), p. 8 He had extensive remodelling work done on Firle Place and between 1743 and 1753, and was involved in a number of land rights disputes regarding windfall trees, soil rights, and manorial waste. Gage also spent considerable time collecting paintings which are still housed in the Long Gallery of Firle Place today. Gage and his son were defeated at the 1754 general election, having decided not to respond to the threats of his voters only to vote for candidates who promised to give ¬£1,500 towards mending the roads. Death and legacy Gage died on 21 December 1754 and was buried at Firle. He was succeeded by his eldest son William Hall Gage, 2nd Viscount Gage. He also had a daughter, Theresa, and a second son Thomas Gage who went on to fame as Commander-in- Chief of the British Army in British America at the beginning of the American War of Independence.

It is a long established business, formerly known as Mother Red Cap or Mother Damnable's. The first reference to a tavern in the area occurs in 1690. At that time the locality was entirely rural and the proprietors relied on trade passing by on the road from London to Hampstead and Highgate. The name Halfway House was accordingly also used. It is not clear whether there was one establishment in the first half of the 18th century or two, but by 1751 the Mother Red Cap and the Mother Black Cap (now The Black Cap) were both in business. In the late 18th century the Mother Red Cap was at its present location, and it had acquired a tea garden. Camden Road was later built across the grounds, and the building was reconstructed. The present building dates from 1875 and was designed by H.H. Bridgman. The pub and venue in its present large guise is the work of Andrew Marler, a serial developer of Licensed Premises, who owned it as a 200 capacity pub and in 1988 bought the whole 'island site' on which it stands. He then enlarged the pub to a capacity of 1,000 and built the 500 capacity Underworld venue beneath the pub. Marler went on in 1994 to buy the BBC Television Theatre from the BBC and refurbish and launch the site as The Shepherd's Bush Empire, continuing with the business model of selling drinks to customers whilst being professionally entertained. The World's End and its Underworld Club, both Camden and Finsbury locations, have won Venue of the Year and hosted bands/artists like Dave Stewart, The Cranberries, Stuck Mojo, The Datsuns, The Darkness and Radiohead, as well as a host of extreme metal bands.

Golden Age The Golden Age's Young Allies were a gang of kids who fought the Axis. Their line-up included the two key sidekicks (Bucky Barnes and Toro) of then-prominent Timely Comics heroes Captain America and the Human Torch. Creation Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby as the Sentinels of Liberty, \\"a multiracial group of patriotic kids,\\" the group was led by Bucky Barnes (Captain America's teenage sidekick), and initially made up of his four friends: Knuckles (Percival Aloysius O'Toole), Jeff (Jefferson Worthing Sandervilt), Tubby (Henry Tinkle), and Whitewash Jones (Washington Jones). The group appeared in a text feature in Captain America #4 (June 1941), but were swiftly moved into the comic-proper to help Cap in his battles, and became popular enough to be spun into its own title. In American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944, Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas take a negative view of the group, describing the four new characters: \\"Jefferson \\"Jeff\\" Sandervilt was the brainy kid, Percival Aloysius \\"Knuckles\\" O'Toole the tough kid, Henry \\"Tubby\\" Tinkle the fat kid, and (alas) Whitewash Jones the harmonica-playing, watermelon-loving, racist-caricature kid.\\" According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"They primarily fight Axis agents: the Red Skull, Agent Zero, the Monk, the Black Talon, the Khan, the Owl, and so on. There are also ordinary gangsters and name criminals like the Doll-Devil, the Python, and the Mad Fiend of Horror Castle.\\" The Young Allies (1941) Young Allies Comics #1 (Summer 1941). Art by Jack Kirby. Launched in Summer 1941 after only a couple of appearances in the pages of Captain America, the \\"Sentinels of Liberty\\" were revised, renamed \\"The Young Allies\\" and joined by the original Human Torch's sidekick Toro. By this time, Simon and Kirby were in the process of leaving Timely for DC Comics, and relationships were strained, so while the first issue of the Young Allies series was pencilled by Kirby (under the shared \\"Charles Nicholas\\" pseudonym), it was written by a young Stan Lee. By issue #2, Kirby had left, and the art duties were taken over by Al Gabriele and former Captain America inker (and then penciler, in the wake of Simon and Kirby's departure) Syd Shores. (Art duties would change considerably over the course of the title's run.) The first issue saw the (mostly non-superhero) team fight Captain America's nemesis the Red Skull, and is often labelled as \\"the first ongoing comic to team up characters from two or more other Marvel series.\\" The team frequently traveled the world to participate in World War II skirmishes and, in keeping with the somewhat exaggerated scope of the series, eventually literally beat up all three major Axis leaders: Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo, something that none of their elders accomplished. Young Allies Comics lasted until issue #20 (October 1946), and also appeared in Amazing Comics, Complete Comics and Kid Komics. Toro and Bucky would continue to team-up briefly, \\"as members of the All-Winners Squad ... [b]ut Knuckles, Jeff, Tubby and Whitewash weren't seen again.\\" In the Young Allies Comics 70th Anniversary Special (2009), their comic book adventures are revealed to be fictional retellings of their real exploits. Their real names are Pat O'Toole, Washington Carver Jones, Geoffrey Worthington Vandergill, and Henry Yosef Tinklebaum. The first two are still alive in the modern day. Heroes Reborn The second group of Young Allies was founded on the Heroes Reborn world, now called Counter-Earth, after the Avengers and Fantastic Four returned home and the planet suffered several devastating blows in the wake of their leaving. While several members share codenames with their predecessors on Earth-616, they have little else in common with the prior group. *Bucky (Rikki Barnes) - Captain America's partner from his time on the HR world. She is the most like her Earth-616 counterpart. She uses a photonic shield as a weapon, and is the group's leader. *I.Q. (Ishmael Questor) - A heavily deformed, quadriplegic telepath and analyst, who works with the Young Allies from his protective, life-sustaining tank in his Earth's Germany. *Kid Colt (Elric Whitemane, born Elric Freedom) - Captured by the world's corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. and experimented on, and bonded to Kymellian DNA, allowing him to assume a humanoid horse form and open miniature wormholes for teleportation. *O and K - Manifestations of Order and Chaos, sent to judge whether Counter-Earth deserved to continue to exist. *Toro (Benito Serrano) - Can turn into a super-strong humanoid bull. Fictional history The Young Allies came into conflict with the Redeemers, a US government-backed team related to the Thunderbolts, while the Redeemers were supervised by Captain America, who, due to amnesia, had forgotten his time on the other Earth with the Allies' Bucky. The conflict was caused by Allies' creation of a hoax chemical weapons scare in the \\"main\\" Earth's Latveria in an attempt to force Doctor Doom, the then-ruler of Counter-Earth, to distribute food and medicine more evenly. When they left, Bucky was left sore that Cap thought she would be capable of really using a WMD, causing Cap to lie to Doom that other canisters had been hidden. Later, they encountered the Thunderbolts themselves on their homeworld, while a rift was threatening to destroy both worlds. When the crisis was resolved and the Thunderbolts returned home, Jolt remained behind with the team. Later, the Exiles visited Counter-Earth to save it from Proteus, in their teammate Morph's body. At first, Proteus convinced the Young Allies to fight the Exiles. The Young Allies later figured out the truth when Proteus was enjoying torturing the Exiles. Proteus seemed to be winning, but two cosmic entities known as \\"O\\" and \\"K\\" ripped Proteus away from the Exiles, saying that they've been waiting for him. They supplied Proteus with an army of nukes. Empress Dorma and Proteus soon clashed, resulting in Proteus taking Dorma's crown, drying up Atlantis, and killing her and her soldiers. The Exiles arrived with the Young Allies at Atlantis. Proteus then launched the nukes. Luckily, Colt and Jolt stopped the nukes without detonating them. Proteus had the Exiles and the Young Allies on the ropes when he put his crown back on. Unbeknownst to him, however, Blink rigged it with a behavior modifier- causing Proteus to believe he really is Morph and being trapped in Morph's body. The Exiles then teleported back to Panoptichron and sent the last remaining nukes into space. The Young Allies then thanked the Exiles for saving their world from the nukes, Dorma, and Proteus as they left. Heroic Age As part of the Heroic Age line-wide reboot, a new team and ongoing series was introduced, written by Sean McKeever, with art by David Baldeon. McKeever has said: Members include Nomad, Firestar, Spider-Girl, Gravity and Toro (Benito Serrano). The series was cancelled with Young Allies #6. They become a team in Onslaught Unleashed #1. They also appear with the Avengers Academy in Avengers Academy Giant-Size #1 (80-page one-shot), at the Avengers Academy prom night in Avengers Academy Issue# 13, the Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt mini-series, and the Spider-Island saga.

From 1970, junior soldiers of the Scottish Division were trained at the Scottish Infantry Depot (SID), Bridge of Don, in Gordon Barracks, and adult recruits trained in the SID Glencorse.

Changes announced in 2004 involved the amalgamation of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers to form the Royal Scots Borderers and the formation of a single large regiment to be known as the Royal Regiment of Scotland.Heyman, p. 88 Regular Army Units * The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland * The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland * The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland * The Highlanders 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland * Balaklava Company, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland Army Reserve Units * 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland * 51st Highland, 7th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland In addition, the Scottish Division also maintains a single regular military band in the Corps of Army Music, the regimental Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

In December 2016, the government announced changes to the administrative structure of the infantry as part of the continuing reorganization of the Army under \\"Army 2020\\". This saw the Royal Regiment of Scotland (which encompassed the entirety of the Scottish Division) transferred to a single administrative formation with the Royal Welsh and the Royal Irish Regiment (which came under the Prince of Wales' Division), known as the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.

The statement was announced by Girard in 1625, and again by Fermat in 1640, but neither supplied a proof. The \\"only if\\" clause is easy: a perfect square is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, hence a sum of two squares is congruent to 0, 1, or 2. An odd prime number is congruent to either 1 or 3 modulo 4, and the second possibility has just been ruled out. The first proof that such a representation exists was given by Leonhard Euler in 1747 and was complicated. Since then, many different proofs have been found. Among them, the proof using Minkowski's theorem about convex setsSee Goldman's book, ¬ß22.5 and Don Zagier's short proof based on involutions have appeared. Euler's proof by infinite descent Euler succeeded in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares in 1749, when he was forty-two years old. He communicated this in a letter to Goldbach dated 12 April 1749.Euler √† Goldbach, lettre CXXV The proof relies on infinite descent, and is only briefly sketched in the letter. The full proof consists in five steps and is published in two papers. The first four steps are Propositions 1 to 4 of the first paperDe numerus qui sunt aggregata duorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 4 (1752/3), 1758, 3-40) and do not correspond exactly to the four steps below. The fifth step below is from the second paper.Demonstratio theorematis FERMATIANI omnem numerum primum formae 4n+1 esse summam duorum quadratorum. (Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 5 (1754/5), 1760, 3-13) The summary is based on Edwards book, pages 45-48. For the avoidance of ambiguity, zero will always be a valid possible constituent of \\"sums of two squares\\", so for example every square of an integer is trivially expressible as the sum of two squares by setting one of them to be zero. 1\\\\. The product of two numbers, each of which is a sum of two squares, is itself a sum of two squares. ::This is a well-known property, based on the identity :::(a^2+b^2)(p^2+q^2) = (ap+bq)^2 + (aq-bp)^2 ::due to Diophantus. 2\\\\. If a number which is a sum of two squares is divisible by a prime which is a sum of two squares, then the quotient is a sum of two squares. (This is Euler's first Proposition). ::Indeed, suppose for example that a^2 + b^2 is divisible by p^2+q^2 and that this latter is a prime. Then p^2 + q^2 divides :::(pb-aq)(pb+aq) = p^2b^2 - a^2q^2 = p^2(a^2+b^2) - a^2(p^2+q^2). ::Since p^2+q^2 is a prime, it divides one of the two factors. Suppose that it divides pb-aq. Since :::(a^2+b^2)(p^2+q^2) = (ap+bq)^2 + (aq- bp)^2 ::(Diophantus's identity) it follows that p^2+q^2 must divide (ap+bq)^2. So the equation can be divided by the square of p^2+q^2. Dividing the expression by (p^2+q^2)^2 yields: :::\\\\frac{a^2+b^2}{p^2+q^2} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{ap+bq}{p^2+q^2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{aq-bp}{p^2+q^2}\\\\right)^2 ::and thus expresses the quotient as a sum of two squares, as claimed. ::On the other hand if p^2+q^2 divides pb+aq, a similar argument holds by using the following variant of Diophantus's identity: :::(a^2+b^2)(q^2+p^2) = (aq+bp)^2 + (ap-bq)^2 . 3\\\\. If a number which can be written as a sum of two squares is divisible by a number which is not a sum of two squares, then the quotient has a factor which is not a sum of two squares. (This is Euler's second Proposition). ::Suppose q is a number not expressible as a sum of two squares, which divides a^2+b^2. Write the quotient, factored into its (possibly repeated) prime factors, as p_1p_2\\\\cdots p_n so that a^2+b^2 = q p_1p_2\\\\cdots p_n. If all factors p_i can be written as sums of two squares, then we can divide a^2+b^2 successively by p_1, p_2, etc., and applying step (2.) above we deduce that each successive, smaller, quotient is a sum of two squares. If we get all the way down to q then q itself would have to be equal to the sum of two squares, which is a contradiction. So at least one of the primes p_i is not the sum of two squares. 4\\\\. If a and b are relatively prime positive integers then every factor of a^2 + b^2 is a sum of two squares. (This is the step that uses step (3.) to produce an 'infinite descent' and was Euler's Proposition 4. The proof sketched below also includes the proof of his Proposition 3). ::Let a,b be relatively prime positive integers: without loss of generality a^2+b^2 is not itself prime, otherwise there is nothing to prove. Let q therefore be a proper factor of a^2+b^2, not necessarily prime: we wish to show that q is a sum of two squares. Again, we lose nothing by assuming q > 2 since the case q = 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 is obvious. ::Let m,n be non-negative integers such that mq,nq are the closest multiples of q (in absolute value) to a,b respectively. Notice that the differences c := a-mq and d := b-nq are integers of absolute value strictly less than q/2: indeed, when q > 2 is even, gcd(a,q/2)=1; otherwise since gcd(a,q/2) \\\\mid q/2 \\\\mid q \\\\mid a^2+b^2, we would also have gcd(a,q/2) \\\\mid b. Multiplying out we obtain :::a^2 + b^2 = m^2q^2 + 2mqc + c^2 + n^2q^2 + 2nqd + d^2 = Aq + (c^2+d^2) ::uniquely defining a non-negative integer A. Since q divides both ends of this equation sequence it follows that c^2+d^2 must also be divisible by q: say c^2+d^2 = qr. Let g be the gcd of c and d which by the co-primeness of a,b is relatively prime to q. Thus g^2 divides r, so writing e = c/g, f = d/g and s = r/g^2, we obtain the expression e^2+f^2 = qs for relatively prime e and f, and with s < q/2 , since :::qs = e^2 + f^2 \\\\leq c^2+d^2 < \\\\left(\\\\frac{q}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{q}{2}\\\\right)^2 = q^2/2. ::Now finally, the descent step: if q is not the sum of two squares, then by step (3.) there must be a factor q_1 say of s which is not the sum of two squares. But q_1 \\\\leq s < q/2 < q and so repeating these steps (initially with e,f;q_1 in place of a,b;q, and so on ad infinitum) we shall be able to find a strictly decreasing infinite sequence q, q_1, q_2, \\\\ldots of positive integers which are not themselves the sums of two squares but which divide into a sum of two relatively prime squares. Since such an infinite descent is impossible, we conclude that q must be expressible as a sum of two squares, as claimed. 5\\\\. Every prime of the form 4n+1 is a sum of two squares. (This is the main result of Euler's second paper). ::If p=4n+1, then by Fermat's Little Theorem each of the numbers 1, 2^{4n}, 3^{4n},\\\\dots, (4n)^{4n} is congruent to one modulo p. The differences 2^{4n}-1, 3^{4n}-2^{4n},\\\\dots,(4n)^{4n}-(4n-1)^{4n} are therefore all divisible by p. Each of these differences can be factored as :::a^{4n}-b^{4n} = \\\\left(a^{2n}+b^{2n}\\\\right)\\\\left(a^{2n}-b^{2n}\\\\right). ::Since p is prime, it must divide one of the two factors. If in any of the 4n-1 cases it divides the first factor, then by the previous step we conclude that p is itself a sum of two squares (since a and b differ by 1, they are relatively prime). So it is enough to show that p cannot always divide the second factor. If it divides all 4n-1 differences 2^{2n}-1, 3^{2n}-2^{2n},\\\\dots,(4n)^{2n}-(4n-1)^{2n}, then it would divide all 4n-2 differences of successive terms, all 4n-3 differences of the differences, and so forth. Since the kth differences of the sequence 1^k, 2^k, 3^k,\\\\dots are all equal to k! (Finite difference), the 2nth differences would all be constant and equal to (2n)!, which is certainly not divisible by p. Therefore, p cannot divide all the second factors which proves that p is indeed the sum of two squares. Lagrange's proof through quadratic forms Lagrange completed a proof in 1775Nouv. M√©m. Acad. Berlin, ann√©e 1771, 125; ibid. ann√©e 1773, 275; ibid ann√©e 1775, 351. based on his general theory of integral quadratic forms. The following presentation incorporates a slight simplification of his argument, due to Gauss, which appears in article 182 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. An (integral binary) quadratic form is an expression of the form ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 with a,b,c integers. A number n is said to be represented by the form if there exist integers x,y such that n = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares is then equivalent to the statement that a prime p is represented by the form x^2 + y^2 (i.e., a=c=1, b=0) exactly when p is congruent to 1 modulo 4. The discriminant of the quadratic form is defined to be b^2 - 4ac. The discriminant of x^2 + y^2 is then equal to -4. Two forms ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 and a'x'^2 + b'x'y' + c'y'^2 are equivalent if and only if there exist substitutions with integer coefficients : x = \\\\alpha x' + \\\\beta y' : y = \\\\gamma x' + \\\\delta y' with \\\\alpha\\\\delta - \\\\beta\\\\gamma = \\\\pm 1 such that, when substituted into the first form, yield the second. Equivalent forms are readily seen to have the same discriminant, and hence also the same parity for the middle coefficient b , which coincides with the parity of the discriminant. Moreover, it is clear that equivalent forms will represent exactly the same integers, because these kind of substitutions can be reversed by substitutions of the same kind. Lagrange proved that all positive definite forms of discriminant ‚àí4 are equivalent. Thus, to prove Fermat's theorem it is enough to find any positive definite form of discriminant ‚àí4 that represents p. For example, one can use a form : px^2 + 2mxy + \\\\left(\\\\frac{m^2+1}{p}\\\\right)y^2, where the first coefficient a = p was chosen so that the form represents p by setting x = 1, and y = 0, the coefficient b = 2m is an arbitrary even number (as it must be, to get an even discriminant), and finally c=\\\\frac{m^2+1}{p} is chosen so that the discriminant b^2-4ac=4m^2-4pc is equal to ‚àí4, which guarantees that the form is indeed equivalent to x^2+y^2 . Of course, the coefficient c=\\\\frac{m^2+1}{p} must be an integer, so the problem is reduced to finding some integer m such that p divides m^2+1: or in other words, a 'square root of -1 modulo p' . We claim such a square root of -1 is given by K = \\\\prod_{k=1}^\\\\frac{p-1}{2} k . Firstly it follows from Euclid's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that ab \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod p \\\\iff a \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod p \\\\ \\\\ \\\\hbox{or}\\\\ \\\\ b \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod p . Consequently, a^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod p \\\\iff a \\\\equiv \\\\pm 1 \\\\pmod p : that is, \\\\pm 1 are their own inverses modulo p and this property is unique to them. It then follows from the validity of Euclidean division in the integers, and the fact that p is prime, that for every 2 \\\\leq a \\\\leq p-2 the gcd of a and p may be expressed via the Euclidean algorithm yielding a unique and distinct inverse a^{-1} eq a of a modulo p. In particular therefore the product of all non-zero residues modulo p is -1. Let L = \\\\prod_{l=\\\\frac{p+1}{2}}^{p-1} l : from what has just been observed, KL \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod p . But by definition, since each term in K may be paired with its negative in L, L = (-1)^\\\\frac{p-1}{2}K , which since p is odd shows that K^2 \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod p \\\\iff p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod 4 , as required. Dedekind's two proofs using Gaussian integers Richard Dedekind gave at least two proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, both using the arithmetical properties of the Gaussian integers, which are numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are integers, and i is the square root of ‚àí1. One appears in section 27 of his exposition of ideals published in 1877; the second appeared in Supplement XI to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's Vorlesungen √ºber Zahlentheorie, and was published in 1894. 1\\\\. First proof. If p is an odd prime number, then we have i^{p-1} = (-1)^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}} in the Gaussian integers. Consequently, writing a Gaussian integer œâ = x + iy with x,y ‚àà Z and applying the Frobenius automorphism in Z[i]/(p), one finds :\\\\omega^p = (x+yi)^p \\\\equiv x^p+y^pi^p \\\\equiv x + (-1)^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}}yi \\\\pmod{p}, since the automorphism fixes the elements of Z/(p). In the current case, p=4n+1 for some integer n, and so in the above expression for œâp, the exponent (p-1)/2 of -1 is even. Hence the right hand side equals œâ, so in this case the Frobenius endomorphism of Z[i]/(p) is the identity. Kummer had already established that if } is the order of the Frobenius automorphism of Z[i]/(p), then the ideal (p) in Z[i] would be a product of 2/f distinct prime ideals. (In fact, Kummer had established a much more general result for any extension of Z obtained by adjoining a primitive m-th root of unity, where m was any positive integer; this is the case of that result.) Therefore, the ideal (p) is the product of two different prime ideals in Z[i]. Since the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain for the norm function N(x + iy)=x^2+y^2, every ideal is principal and generated by a nonzero element of the ideal of minimal norm. Since the norm is multiplicative, the norm of a generator \\\\alpha of one of the ideal factors of (p) must be a strict divisor of N(p) = p^2, so that we must have p = N(\\\\alpha) = N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2, which gives Fermat's theorem. 2\\\\. Second proof. This proof builds on Lagrange's result that if p=4n+1 is a prime number, then there must be an integer m such that m^2 + 1 is divisible by p (we can also see this by Euler's criterion); it also uses the fact that the Gaussian integers are a unique factorization domain (because they are a Euclidean domain). Since does not divide either of the Gaussian integers m + i and m-i (as it does not divide their imaginary parts), but it does divide their product m^2 + 1, it follows that p cannot be a prime element in the Gaussian integers. We must therefore have a nontrivial factorization of p in the Gaussian integers, which in view of the norm can have only two factors (since the norm is multiplicative, and p^2 = N(p), there can only be up to two factors of p), so it must be of the form p = (x+yi)(x-yi) for some integers x and y. This immediately yields that p = x^2 + y^2. Proof by Minkowski's Theorem For p congruent to 1 mod 4 a prime, -1 is a quadratic residue mod p by Euler's criterion. Therefore, there exists an integer m such that p divides m^2+1. Let \\\\hat{i}, \\\\hat{j} be the standard basis elements for the vector space \\\\mathbb{R}^2 and set \\\\vec{u} = \\\\hat{i} + m\\\\hat{j} and \\\\vec{v} = 0\\\\hat{i} + p\\\\hat{j}. Consider the lattice S = {a\\\\vec{u} + b\\\\vec{v} \\\\mid a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z}. If \\\\vec{w} = a\\\\vec{u} + b\\\\vec{v} = a \\\\hat{i} + (am + bp)\\\\hat{j} \\\\in S then vec{w}\\\\^2 \\\\equiv a^2 + (am+bp)^2 \\\\equiv a^2(1 + m^2) \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{p}. Thus p divides vec{w}\\\\^2 for any \\\\vec{w} \\\\in S. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is p. The area of the open disk, D, of radius \\\\sqrt{2p} centered around the origin is 2 \\\\pi p > 4p. Furthermore, D is convex and symmetrical about the origin. Therefore, by Minkowski's theorem there exists a nonzero vector \\\\vec{w} \\\\in S such that \\\\vec{w} \\\\in D. Both vec{w}\\\\^2 < 2p and p \\\\mid vec{w}\\\\^2 so p = vec{w}\\\\^2. Hence p is the sum of the squares of the components of \\\\vec{w}. Zagier's \\"one-sentence proof\\" Let p=4k+1 be prime, let \\\\mathbb{N} denote the natural numbers (with or without zero), and consider the finite set S={(x,y,z)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^3: x^2+4yz=p} of triples of numbers. Then S has two involutions: an obvious one (x,y,z)\\\\mapsto (x,z,y) whose fixed points (x,y,y) correspond to representations of p as a sum of two squares, and a more complicated one, : (x,y,z)\\\\mapsto \\\\begin{cases} (x+2z,~z,~y-x-z),\\\\quad \\\\textrm{if}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, x < y-z \\\\ (2y-x,~y,~x-y+z),\\\\quad \\\\textrm{if}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, y-z < x < 2y\\\\ (x-2y,~x-y+z,~y),\\\\quad \\\\textrm{if}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, x > 2y \\\\end{cases} which has exactly one fixed point (1,1,k). Two involutions over the same finite set must have sets of fixed points with the same parity, and since the second involution has an odd number of fixed points, so does the first. Zero is even, so the first involution has a nonzero number of fixed points, any one of which gives a representation of p as a sum of two squares. This proof, due to Zagier, is a simplification of an earlier proof by Heath- Brown, which in turn was inspired by a proof of Liouville. The technique of the proof is a combinatorial analogue of the topological principle that the Euler characteristics of a topological space with an involution and of its fixed-point set have the same parity and is reminiscent of the use of sign- reversing involutions in the proofs of combinatorial bijections. This proof is equivalent to a geometric or \\"visual\\" proof using \\"windmill\\" figures, described in this MathOverflow post and this Mathologer YouTube video . Proof with partition theory In 2016, A. David Christopher gave a partition-theoretic proof by considering partitions of the odd prime n having exactly two sizes a_i (i=1,2), each occurring exactly a_i times, and by showing that at least one such partition exists if n is congruent to 1 modulo 4.A.

The Church traces its founding to Jesus and the Twelve Apostles and sees the Bishops of the Church as the successors of the Apostles. While it derives its apostolic succession from the Old Catholic Church, the LCCI is today not in full communion with either the Utrecht Union, or the Roman Catholic Church, and differs with them theologically in several important respects. As of 2017, the LCCI has a presence in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia. Beliefs The Church maintains a high level of intellectual liberty for its members in such matters as the interpretation of creeds, as well as freedom of conscience. From 1956 to 1994, due to its emphasis of Freedom of Belief, no definitive statement of \\"Official Teachings\\" of the Church existed. In response to the many inquiries of persons interested knowing more about the Church, the General Episcopal Synod saw fit in 1994 to assemble a list of teachings that they felt reflected the character of the LCCI. It should be understood, however, that these statements are teachings, but not required beliefs. The Church's stance on freedom of thought has not been abandoned. A selection from this list follows: > *The Church recognizes the historic seven sacraments, which are: Baptism, > Confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Absolution, Extreme Unction, Holy Matrimony, > and Holy Orders. *The Church teaches the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. *The > Church teaches that we are all immortal, both before and after physical > death. *The Church teaches that in the Holy Eucharist the substance of the > bread and wine become linked, or polarized, on the Life of the Christ and > become literal outposts of His Life and His Consciousness. And that the Holy > Eucharist is designed to help those who physically take part, and to pour > out a flood of spiritual power upon the surrounding world. (The Church has > open communion.) *The Church teaches that the Minor orders (Cleric/Tonsure, > Doorkeeper, Reader, Exorcist, Acolyte and Subdeacon) are intended primarily > to assist the candidate in his own spiritual growth and life and that the > Major orders (Deacon, Priest, and Bishop) are intended primarily to assist > the Christian Community. (Clergy are allowed to marry.) *The Church teaches > that the Holy Bible, the Creeds, and the Traditions of the Church are the > means by which the teachings of Christ have been handed down to His > followers. They are fundamental, true, and sufficient as a basis for right > understanding and right conduct. *The Church teaches that all Christian > worship is valid, of whatever kind, so long as it is earnest and true. *The > Church teaches that everyone shall \\"one day reach His Feet, however far they > stray.\\" We teach that the \\"dead\\" pass to a life of higher service, where > there is available to them the \\"felicity of [the] . . . Presence, evermore . > . . .\\" What we shall experience \\"at His Feet\\" is conscious life in Christ. In 2004, the GES approved the ordination of women to all Holy Orders up to and including Bishop. Church structure The Liberal Catholic Church International is governed by the \\"General Episcopal Synod\\" of all Bishops. The Synod meets formally about every three years and it elects a Presiding Bishop from among their ranks as the church's titular head. The General Episcopal Synod also elects Priests to the Episcopacy, with the approval of the parishes of their respective provinces. The current Presiding Bishop is the Most Reverend Bennett D. D. Burke. Each province is governed by a Regionary Bishop who, in turn, may have one or more Bishops functioning as auxiliaries. For the most part these clergy are not financially compensated and hold secular jobs. Laity Laypersons in the Church come from diverse backgrounds and from all spiritual paths. Due to the open nature of the Church, no layperson is required to accept any of the more \\"formal\\" beliefs of the Church, and are allowed to accept or reject them as they please. Seminary Training for the clergy varies from diocese to diocese, but generally postulants take distance study courses from the Archbishop Charles W. Finn Theological Seminary, which offers three tracks of study: one for Holy Orders, one for lay theologian, and another for personal enrichment. Seminarians are encouraged to pray the Divine Office of the Church, specifically the morning prayer or Prime, and the evening prayer or Complin. Liturgy The Church uses its own liturgy, today known as the Liberal Rite. This liturgy was mostly composed by Bishop Wedgwood, with Bishop Leadbeater assisting on the Collects, and selecting the Psalms, canticles, and weekly epistle and gospel readings. The rite focuses more on the glorification of God, rather than the depravity of man. Religious orders Both the ordained and the laity may enter the religious life as friars or sisters. A candidate takes vows confirming their desire to follow the order's common rule. Currently there are two religious orders in the church, including the Apostolic Society of St. Brigid of Kildare (SSB), and the Order of St. John the Apostle (OSJA). History The Church traces its apostolic succession to Archbishop Arnold Harris Mathew. Mathew was consecrated bishop on 28 April 1908, by Utrecht Archbishop Gerhardus Gul, assisted by the Old Catholic bishops of Deventer and Berne, in St. Gertrude's Old Catholic Cathedral, Utrecht. Only two years later, Mathew declared his autonomy from the Union of Utrecht, with which he had experienced tension from the beginning. It was only a short time later that Bishop Mathew found himself at odds with his own clergy in Great Britain and ultimately walked away to seek union with the Roman Catholic Church. The founding bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church was James I. Wedgwood of the Wedgwood China family, formerly a cleric in the Church of England (Anglican). Wedgwood grew dissatisfied with the Church, and discovered the Theosophical Society, which had a stronger appeal to his sense of life and justice. When Archbishop Mathew sought to ordain those clergy who were dissatisfied with the Church of England, Wedgwood was one who joined the new Old Catholic Church of England. Archbishop Mathew knew of Wedgwood's membership in the Theosophical Society, as well as that of other clergy in the Old Catholic Church of England, and originally promised that this would not be a problem, but later retracted that promise and asked all clergy to resign from the Theosophical Society. Not willing to do so, Father Wedgwood and most of the Old Catholic Church in England found themselves without a bishop as they withdrew from Archbishop Mathew's leadership. One of the men whom Archbishop Mathew had consecrated to the episcopate, Bishop Frederick Samuel Willoughby, offered to consecrate and elevate one of the withdrawn clergy to the episcopate so that they would not be without a bishop. Father Wedgwood was selected and elevated to the episcopate on February 13, 1916. The Church was eventually reorganized and renamed The Liberal Catholic Church. Archbishop Wedgwood then consecrated another former Anglican priest, Charles W. Leadbeater, later that same year, with Bishop Leadbeater going on to become the second presiding bishop of the Church in later years. The LCCI arose from the 1941 schism of the Liberal Catholic Church in the United States, which surrounded the controversy involving American Regionary Bishop Charles Hampton, who wished to keep adherence to Theosophical tenets optional for all clergy, in accordance with the wishes of the church's first two Presiding Bishops, James I. Wedgwood and Charles W. Leadbeater. During the controversy of the 1940s, the third presiding bishop, Frank W. Pigott, who embraced a more Theosophical vision for the church's future, suspended Bishop Hampton and all the clergy under him who refused to endorse his episcopal replacement. Bishop Pigott also ordered the confiscation of church property at the Regionary headquarters in California. The American Synod saw this as a breach of canon law and a violation of the laws of California under which the church had been incorporated in America. The majority of clergy in America, who had supported Bishop Hampton, broke with Bishop Pigott and continued as the Liberal Catholic Church, with Bishop Ray M. Wardall becoming the 4th Presiding Bishop in 1943. The Church eventually won the right in a court of law to use the name The Liberal Catholic Church (while being called the Liberal Catholic Church International in the rest of the world), although the litigation was settled after Bishop Hampton's death. In 1955, Edward M Matthews became the 5th Presiding Bishop, followed by Francis Erwin in 1962. The 7th Presiding Bishop was William H. Daw in 1970, followed by Joseph Neth in 1974. The 9th Presiding Bishop was Dean E. Bekken in 1989, followed by Charles W. Finn, James P. Roberts, and Jason Sanderson. Bennett D. D. Burke was raised to the office of Presiding Bishop in February 2016. On October 13th, 2019, The Most Rev. Celia Jose, pastor of St. Michael and All Angels Liberal Catholic Cathedral, was installed as Presiding Bishop at the Cathedral Church of St. Thomas the Apostle, during the church's Synod in New York. She was the first woman and the first Latina to hold this office.https://www.pinalcentral.com/religion/casa-grande-woman-to-be-elevated- to-office-of-presiding/article_d837b883-9cbd-5e22-a13e-96eca4281e5b.html St. Thomas Cathedral Altar in NYC ReferencesExternal links * Liberal Catholic Church, Diocese of Arizona * Liberal Catholic Church International, Province of Great Britain and Ireland Category:Independent Catholic denominations Category:Christian organizations established in 1916 Category:Christian denominations established in the 20th century ","title":"Liberal Catholic Church International"},{"id":"1882828","text":"A·πÖgulimƒÅla (PƒÅli language; lit. 'finger necklace') is an important figure in Buddhism, particularly within the TheravƒÅda tradition. Depicted as a ruthless brigand who completely transforms after a conversion to Buddhism, he is seen as the example par excellence of the redemptive power of the Buddha's teaching and the Buddha's skill as a teacher. A·πÖgulimƒÅla is seen by Buddhists as the \\"patron saint\\" of childbirth and is associated with fertility in South and Southeast Asia. A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story can be found in numerous sources in PƒÅli, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese. A·πÖgulimƒÅla is born Ahi·πÉsaka. He grows up as an intelligent young man in SƒÅvatthƒ´, and during his studies becomes the favorite student of his teacher. However, out of jealousy, fellow students set him up against his teacher. In an attempt to get rid of A·πÖg≈´limƒÅla, the teacher sends him on a deadly mission to find a thousand human fingers to complete his studies. Trying to accomplish this mission, A·πÖgulimƒÅla becomes a cruel brigand, killing many and causing entire villages to emigrate. Eventually, this causes the king to send an army to catch the killer. Meanwhile, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's mother attempts to interfere, almost causing her to be killed by her son as well. The Buddha manages to prevent this, however, and uses his power and teachings to bring A·πÖgulimƒÅla to the right path. A·πÖgulimƒÅla becomes a follower of the Buddha, and to the surprise of the king and others, becomes a monk under his guidance. Villagers are still angry with A·πÖgulimƒÅla, but this is improved somewhat when A·πÖgulimƒÅla helps a mother with childbirth through an act of truth. Scholars have theorized that A·πÖgulimƒÅla may have been part of a violent cult before his conversion. Indologist Richard Gombrich has suggested that he was a follower of an early form of Tantra, but this claim has been debunked. Buddhists consider A·πÖgulimƒÅla a symbol of spiritual transformation, and his story a lesson that everyone can change their life for the better, even the least likely people. This inspired the official Buddhist prison chaplaincy in the UK to name their organization after him. Moreover, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story is referred to in scholarly discussions of justice and rehabilitation, and is seen by theologian John Thompson as a good example of coping with moral injury and an ethics of care. A·πÖgulimƒÅla has been the subject of movies and literature, with a Thai movie of the same name choosing to depict him following the earliest sources, and the book The Buddha and the Terrorist by Satish Kumar adapting the story as a non-violent response to the Global War on Terror.  Textual sources and epigraphical findings  Buddhagho·π£a (commentator from 5th century CE; depicted at the right) The story of A·πÖgulimƒÅla is most well-known in the TheravƒÅda tradition. Two texts in the early discourses in the PƒÅli language are concerned with A·πÖgulimƒÅla's initial encounter with the Buddha and his conversion, and are believed to present the oldest version of the story. The first is the TheragƒÅthƒÅ, probably the oldest of the two, and the second is the A·πÖgulimƒÅla Sutta in the Majjhima NikƒÅya. Both offer a short description of A·πÖgulimƒÅla's encounter with the Buddha, and do not mention much of the background information later incorporated into the story (such as A·πÖgulimƒÅla being placed under oath by a teacher). Apart from the PƒÅli texts, the life of A·πÖgulimƒÅla is also described in Tibetan and Chinese texts which originate from Sanskrit. The Sanskrit collection called Sa·πÉyuktƒÅgama from the early M≈´lasƒÅrvastivƒÅda school, has been translated in two Chinese texts (in the 4th5th century CE) by the early SarvƒÅstivƒÅda and KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya schools and also contains versions of the story. A text translated in Chinese from the Sanskrit Ekottara AgƒÅma by the MahƒÅsa·πÉghika school is also known. Furthermore, three other Chinese texts dealing with A·πÖgulimƒÅla have also been found, of unknown origin but different from the first three Chinese texts. Apart from these early texts, there are also later renderings, which appear in the commentary to the Majjhima NikƒÅya attributed to Buddhaghosa (5th century CE) and the TheragƒÅthƒÅ commentary attributed to DhammapƒÅla (6th century CE). The two commentaries do not appear to be independent of one another: it appears that DhammapƒÅla has copied or closely paraphrased Buddhaghosa, although adding explanation of some inconsistencies. The earliest accounts of A·πÖgulimƒÅla's life emphasize the fearless violence of A·πÖgulimƒÅla and, by contrast, the peacefulness of the Buddha. Later accounts attempt to include more detail and clarify anything that might not conform with Buddhist doctrine. For example, one problem that is likely to have raised questions is the sudden transformation from a killer to an enlightened disciplelater accounts try to explain this. Later accounts also include more miracles, however, and together with the many narrative details this tends to overshadow the main points of the story. The early PƒÅli discourses () do not provide for any motive for A·πÖgulimƒÅla's actions, other than sheer cruelty. Later texts may represent attempts by later commentators to \\"rehabilitate\\" the character of A·πÖgulimƒÅla, making him appear as a fundamentally good human being entrapped by circumstance, rather than as a vicious killer. In addition to the discourses and verses, there are also JƒÅtaka tales, the Milindapa√±hƒÅ, and parts of the monastic discipline that deal with A·πÖgulimƒÅla, as well as the later MahƒÅva·πÉsa chronicle. Later texts from other languages that relate A·πÖgulimƒÅla's life include the AvadƒÅna text called Sataka, as well as a later collection of tales called Discourse on the Wise and the Fool, which exists in Tibetan and Chinese. There are also travel accounts of Chinese pilgrims that mention A·πÖgulimƒÅla briefly. In addition to descriptions of the life of A·πÖgulimƒÅla, there is a MahƒÅyƒÅna discourse called the A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra, which Gautama Buddha addresses to A·πÖgulimƒÅla. This is one of the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tras, a group of discourses that deal with the Buddha Nature. There is another s≈´tra with the same name, referred to in Chinese texts, which was used to defend the Buddhist stance against alcoholic beverages. This text has not been found, however. Apart from textual evidence, early epigraphic evidence has also been found. One of the earliest reliefs that depicts A·πÖgulimƒÅla dates from approximately 3rd century BCE.  Story = Previous incarnations  The texts describe a previous incarnation before A·πÖgulimƒÅla met the Buddha Gautama. In this life, he was born as a man-eating king turned yaksha (, a sort of demon; ), in some texts called SaudƒÅsa. SaudƒÅsa develops an interest in consuming human flesh when he is served the flesh of a dead baby. When he asks for more, his subjects start to fear for their children's safety and he is driven from his own kingdom. Growing into a monster, SaudƒÅsa meets a deity that promises SaudƒÅsa can retrieve his status as king if he sacrifices one hundred other kings. Having killed 99 kings, a king called Sutasoma changes SaudƒÅsa's mind and makes him a religious man, and he gives up all violence. The texts identify Sutasoma with a previous incarnation of the Buddha, and SaudƒÅsa with a previous incarnation of A·πÖgulimƒÅla. According to the Ekottara AgƒÅma, however, in a previous incarnation A·πÖgulimƒÅla is a crown prince, whose goodness and virtue irritate his enemies. When his enemies kill him, he takes a vow just before his death that he may avenge his death, and attain Nirvana in a future life under the guidance of a master. In this version, the killings by A·πÖgulimƒÅla's are therefore justified as a response to the evil done to him in a past life, and his victims receive the same treatment they once subjected A·πÖgulimƒÅla with.  Youth  Remains of alt=RuinsIn most texts, A·πÖgulimƒÅla is born in SƒÅvatthƒ´, in the brahman (priest) caste of the Gagga clan, his father Bhaggava being the chaplain of the king of Kosala, and his mother called MantƒÅnƒ´. According to commentarial texts, omens seen at the time of the child's birth (the flashing of weapons and the appearance of the \\"constellation of thieves\\" in the sky) indicate that the child is destined to become a brigand. As the father is interpreting the omens for the king, the king asks whether the child will be a lone brigand or a band leader. When Bhaggava replies that he will be a lone brigand, the king decides to let it live. Buddhaghosa relates that the father names the child Ahi·πÉsaka, meaning 'the harmless one'. This is derived from the word ahi·πÉsa (non-violence), because no-one is hurt at his birth, despite the bad omens. The commentary by DhammapƒÅla states that he is initially named Hi·πÉsaka ('the harmful one') by the worried king, but that the name is later changed. Having grown up, Ahi·πÉsaka is handsome, intelligent and well-behaved. His parents send him to Taxila to study under a well-known teacher. There he excels in his studies and becomes the teacher's favorite student, enjoying special privileges in his teacher's house. However, the other students grow jealous of Ahi·πÉsaka's speedy progress and seek to turn his master against him. To that end, they make it seem as though Ahi·πÉsaka has seduced the master's wife. Unwilling or unable to attack Ahi·πÉsaka directly, the teacher says that Ahi·πÉsaka's training as a true brahman is almost complete, but that he must provide the traditional final gift offered to a teacher and then he will grant his approval. As his payment, the teacher demands a thousand fingers, each taken from a different human being, thinking that A·πÖgulimƒÅla will be killed in the course of seeking this grisly prize. According to Buddhaghosa, Ahi·πÉsaka objects to this, saying he comes from a peaceful family, but eventually the teacher persuades him. But according to other versions, Ahi·πÉsaka does not protest against the teacher's command. In another version of the story, the teacher's wife tries to seduce Ahi·πÉsaka. When the latter refuses her advances, she is spiteful and tells the teacher Ahi·πÉsaka has tried to seduce her. The story continues in the same way.  Life as a brigand  Following his teacher's bidding, A·πÖgulimƒÅla becomes a highwayman, living on a cliff in a forest called JƒÅlinƒ´ where he can see people passing through, and kills or hurts those travelers. He becomes infamous for his skill in seizing his victims. When the people start to avoid roads, he enters villages and drags people from their homes to kill them. Entire villages become abandoned. He never takes clothes or jewels from his victims, only fingers. To keep count of the number of victims that he has taken, he strings them on a thread and hangs them on a tree. However, because birds begin to eat the flesh from the fingers, he starts to wear them as a sacrificial thread. Thus he comes to be known as A·πÖgulimƒÅla, meaning 'necklace of fingers'. In some reliefs, he is depicted as wearing a headdress of fingers rather than a necklace.  Meeting the Buddha  Hatyai, Thailandupright=0.9 Surviving villagers migrate from the area and complain to Pasenadi, the king of Kosala. Pasenadi responds by sending an army of 500 soldiers to hunt down A·πÖgulimƒÅla. Meanwhile, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's parents hear about the news that Pasenadi is hunting an outlaw. Since A·πÖgulimƒÅla was born with bad omens, they conclude it must be him. Although the father prefers not to interfere, the mother disagrees. Fearing for her son's life, she sets out to find her son, warn him of the king's intent and take care of him. The Buddha perceives through meditative vision () that A·πÖgulimƒÅla has slain 999 victims, and is desperately seeking a thousandth. If the Buddha is to encounter A·πÖgulimƒÅla that day, the latter will become a monk and subsequently attain abhi√±√±ƒÅ. However, if A·πÖgulimƒÅla is to kill his mother instead, she will be his thousandth victim and he will be unsavable, since matricide in Buddhism is considered one of the five worst actions a person can commit. The Buddha sets off to intercept A·πÖgulimƒÅla, despite being warned by local villagers not to go. On the road through the forest of Kosala, A·πÖgulimƒÅla first sees his mother. According to some versions of the story, he then has a moment of reconciliation with her, she providing food for him. After some deliberation, however, he decides to make her his thousandth victim. But then when the Buddha also arrives, he chooses to kill him instead. He draws his sword, and starts running towards the Buddha. But although A·πÖgulimƒÅla is running as fast as he can, he cannot catch up with the Buddha who is walking calmly. The Buddha is using some supernatural accomplishment (; ) that affects A·πÖgulimƒÅla: one text states the Buddha through these powers contracts and expands the earth on which they stand, thus keeping a distance of A·πÖgulimƒÅla. This bewilders A·πÖgulimƒÅla so much that he calls to the Buddha to stop. The Buddha then says that he himself has already stopped, and that it is A·πÖgulimƒÅla who should stop: A·πÖgulimƒÅla asks for further explanation, after which the Buddha says that a good monk should control his desires. A·πÖgulimƒÅla is impressed by the Buddha's courage, and struck with guilt about what he has done. After listening to the Buddha, A·πÖgulimƒÅla reverently declares himself converted, vows to cease his life as a brigand and joins the Buddhist monastic order. He is admitted in the Jetavana monastery.  Life as a monk and death  Songhkla, Southern Thailandupright=0.5 Meanwhile, King Pasenadi sets out to kill A·πÖgulimƒÅla. He stops first to pay a visit to the Buddha and his followers at the Jetavana monastery. He explains to the Buddha his purpose, and the Buddha asks how the king will respond if he were to discover that A·πÖgulimƒÅla had given up the life of a highwayman and become a monk. The king says that he would salute him and offer to provide for him in his monastic vocation. The Buddha then reveals that A·πÖgulimƒÅla is sitting only a few feet away, his hair and beard shaven off, a member of the Buddhist order. The king, astounded but also delighted, addresses A·πÖgulimƒÅla by his clan and mother's name () and offers to donate robe materials to A·πÖgulimƒÅla. A·πÖgulimƒÅla, however, does not accept the gift, because of an ascetic training he observes. In the end, the king chooses not to persecute A·πÖgulimƒÅla. This passage would agree with Buddhologist Andr√© Bareau's observation that there was an unwritten agreement of mutual non-interference between the Buddha and kings and rulers of the time. Later, A·πÖgulimƒÅla comes across a young woman undergoing difficult labor during a childbirth. A·πágulimƒÅla is profoundly moved by this, and understands pain and feels compassion to an extent he did not know when he was still a brigand. He goes to the Buddha and asks him what he can do to ease her pain. The Buddha tells A·πÖgulimƒÅla to go to the woman and say: A·πÖgulimƒÅla points out that it would be untrue for him to say this, to which the Buddha responds with this revised stanza: The Buddha is here drawing Angulimala's attention to his choice of having become a monk, describing this as a second birth that contrasts with his previous life as a brigand. JƒÅti means birth, but the word is also glossed in the PƒÅli commentaries as clan or lineage (). Thus, the word jƒÅti here also refers to the lineage of the Buddhas, i.e. the monastic community. After A·πÖgulimƒÅla makes this \\"act of truth\\", the woman safely gives birth to her child. This verse later became one of the protective verses, commonly called the A·πÖgulimƒÅla paritta. Monastics continue to recite the text during blessings for pregnant women in TheravƒÅda countries, and often memorize it as part of monastic training. Thus, A·πÖgulimƒÅla is widely seen by devotees as the \\"patron saint\\" of childbirth. Changing from a murderer to a person seen to ensure safe childbirth has been a huge transformation. This event helps A·πÖgulimƒÅla to find peace. After performing the act of truth, he is seen to \\"bring life rather than death to the townspeople\\" and people start to approach him and provide him with almsfood. However, a resentful few cannot forget that he was responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. With sticks and stones they attack him as he walks for alms. With a bleeding head, torn outer robe and a broken alms bowl, A·πÖgulimƒÅla manages to return to the monastery. The Buddha encourages A·πÖgulimƒÅla to bear his torment with equanimity; he indicates that A·πÖgulimƒÅla is experiencing the fruits of the karma that would otherwise have condemned him to hell. Having become an enlightened disciple, A·πÖgulimƒÅla remains firm and invulnerable in mind. According to Buddhist teachings, enlightened disciples cannot create any new karma, but they may still be subject to the effects of old karma that they once did. The effects of his karma are inevitable, and even the Buddha cannot stop them from occurring. After having admitted A·πÖgulimƒÅla in the monastic order, the Buddha issues a rule that from now on, no criminals should be accepted as monks in the order. Buddhaghosa states that A·πÖgulimƒÅla dies shortly after becoming a monk. After his death, a discussion arises among the monks as to what A·πÖgulimƒÅla's afterlife destination is. When the Buddha states that A·πÖgulimƒÅla has attained Nirvana, this surprises some monks. They wonder how it is possible for someone who killed so many people to still attain enlightenment. The Buddha responds that even after having done much evil, a person still has a possibility to change for the better and attain enlightenment.  Analysis  upright=1.3  Historical  The giving of goodbye gifts to one's teacher was customary in ancient India. There is an example in the \\"Book of Pau·π£ya\\" of the Vedic epic MahƒÅbharatha. Here the teacher sends his disciple Uttanka away after Uttanka has proven himself worthy of being trustworthy and in the possession of all the Vedic and Dharmashastric teachings. Uttanka says to his teacher: Indologist Friedrich Wilhelm maintains that similar phrases already occur in the Book of Manu (II,111) and in the Institutes of Vishnu. By taking leave of their teacher and promising to do whatever their teacher asks of them, brings, according to the Vedic teachings, enlightenment or a similar attainment. It is therefore not unusual that A·πÖgulimƒÅla is described to do his teacher's horrible bidding‚Äîalthough being a good and kind person at heart‚Äîin the knowledge that in the end he will reap the highest attainment. The idea that A·πÖgulimƒÅla was part of a violent cult was already suggested by the Chinese pilgrim upright=0.6Indologist Richard Gombrich has postulated that the story of A·πÖgulimƒÅla may be a historical encounter between the Buddha and a follower of an early Saivite or Shakti form of tantra. Gombrich reaches this conclusion on the basis of a number of inconsistencies in the texts that indicate possible corruption, and the fairly weak explanations for A·πÖgulimƒÅla's behavior provided by the commentators. He notes that there are several other references in the early PƒÅli canon that seem to indicate the presence of devotees of ≈öaiva, KƒÅli, and other divinities associated with sanguinary (violent) tantric practices. The textual inconsistencies discovered could be explained through this theory. The idea that A·πÖgulimƒÅla was part of a violent cult was already suggested by the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang (602‚Äì64 CE). In his travel accounts, Xuan Zang states that A·πÖgulimƒÅla's was taught by his teacher that he would be born in the Brahma heaven if he killed a Buddha. A Chinese early text gives a similar description, stating that A·πÖgulimƒÅla's teacher followed the gruesome instructions of his guru, to attain immortality. Xuan Zang's suggestion was further developed by European translators of Xuan Zang's travel accounts in the early twentieth century, but partly based on translation errors. Regardless, Gombrich is the first recent scholar to postulate this idea. However, Gombrich's claim that tantric practices existed before the finalization of the canon of Buddhist discourses (two to three centuries BCE) goes against mainstream scholarship. Scholarly consensus places the arising of the first tantric cults about a thousand years later, and no corroborating evidence has been found, whether textual or otherwise, of earlier sanguinary tantric practices. Though Gombrich argues that there other, similar antinomian practices (going against moral norms) which are only mentioned once in Buddhist scriptures and for which no evidence can be found outside of the scriptures, Buddhist Studies scholars Mudagamuwa and Von Rospatt dismiss these as incorrect examples. They also take issue with Gombrich's metrical arguments, thus disagreeing with Gombrich's hypotheses with regard to A·πÖgulimƒÅla. They do consider it possible, however, that AngulimƒÅla's violent practices were part of some kind of historical cult. Buddhist Studies scholar L. S. Cousins has also expressed doubts about Gombrich's theory. In the Chinese translation of the Damam≈´khƒÅvadƒÅna by Hui- chiao, as well as in archaeological findings, A·πÖgulimƒÅla is identified with the mythological Hindu king Kalmashapada or SaudƒÅsa, known since Vedic times. Ancient texts often describe SaudƒÅsa's life as A·πÖgulimƒÅla's previous life, and both characters deal with the problem of being a good brahman. Studying art depictions in the GandhƒÅra region, Archeologist Maurizio Taddei theorizes that the story of A·πÖgulimƒÅla may point at an Indian mythology with regard to a yak·π£a living in the wild. In many depictions A·πÖgulimƒÅla is wearing a headdress, which Taddei describes as an example of dionysian-like iconography. Art historian Pia Brancaccio argues, however, that the headdress is an Indian symbol used for figures associated with the wild or hunting. She concurs with Taddei that depictions of A·πÖgulimƒÅla, especially in GandhƒÅra, are in many ways reminiscent of dionysian themes in Greek art and mythology, and influence is highly likely. However, Brancaccio argues that the headdress was essentially an Indian symbol, used by artists to indicate A·πÖgulimƒÅla belonged to a forest tribe, feared by the early Buddhists who were mostly urban.  Doctrinal  Among Buddhists, A·πÖgulimƒÅla is one of the most well-known stories. Not only in modern times: in ancient times, two important Chinese pilgrims travelling to India reported about the story, and reported about the places they visited that were associated with A·πÖgulimƒÅla's life. From a Buddhist perspective, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story serves as an example that even the worst of people can overcome their faults and return to the right path. The commentaries uphold the story as an example of good karma destroying evil karma. Buddhists widely regard A·πÖgulimƒÅla as a symbol of complete transformation and as a showcase that the Buddhist path can transform even the least likely initiates. Buddhists have raised A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story as an example of the compassion () and supernatural accomplishment () of the Buddha. A·πÖgulimƒÅla's conversion is cited as a testimony to the Buddha's capabilities as a teacher, and as an example of the healing qualities of the teaching of the Buddha (Dharma). Through his reply, the Buddha connects the notion of 'refraining from harming' () with stillness, which is the cause and effect of not harming. Furthermore, the story illustrates that there is spiritual power in such stillness, as the Buddha is depicted as outrunning the violent A·πÖgulimƒÅla. Though this is explained as being the result of the Buddha's supernatural accomplishment, the deeper meaning is that \\"... 'the spiritually still person' can move faster than the 'conventionally active' person\\". In other words, spiritual achievement is only possible through non-violence. Furthermore, this stillness refers to the Buddhist notion of liberation from karma: as long as one cannot escape from the endless law of karmic retribution, one can at least lessen one's karma by practicing non-violence. The texts describe this as form of stillness, as opposed to the continuous movement of karmic retribution.  Other  King Pasenadi planting a Bodhi Tree in honor of the Buddha. The story of A·πÖgulimƒÅla illustrates how criminals are affected by their psycho- social and physical environment. Jungian analyst Dale Mathers theorizes that Ahi·πÉsaka started to kill because his meaning system had broken down. He was no longer appreciated as an academic talent. His attitude could be summarized as \\"I have no value: therefore I can kill. If I kill, then that proves I have no value\\". Summarizing the life of A·πÖgulimƒÅla, Mathers writes, who bridges giving and taking life.\\" Similarly, referring to the psychological concept of moral injury, theologian John Thompson describes A·πÖgulimƒÅla as someone who is betrayed by an authority figure but manages to recover his eroded moral code and repair the community he has affected. Survivors of moral injury need a clinician and a community of people that face struggles together but deal with those in a safe way; similarly, A·πÖgulimƒÅla is able to recover from his moral injury due to the Buddha as his spiritual guide, and a monastic community that leads a disciplined life, tolerating hardship. Thompson has further suggested A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story might be used as a sort of narrative therapy and describes the ethics presented in the narrative as inspiring responsibility. The story is not about being saved, but rather saving oneself with help from others. Ethics scholar David Loy has written extensively about A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story and the implications it has for the justice system. He believes that in Buddhist ethics, the only reason offenders should be punished is to reform their character. If an offender, like A·πÖgulimƒÅla, has already reformed himself, there is no reason to punish him, even as a deterrent. Furthermore, Loy argues that the story of A·πÖgulimƒÅla does not include any form of restorative or transformative justice, and therefore considers the story \\"flawed\\" as an example of justice. Former politician and community health scholar Mathura Shrestha, on the other hand, describes A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story as \\"[p]robably the first concept of transformative justice\\", citing A·πÖgulimƒÅla's repentance and renunciation of his former life as a brigand, and the pardon he eventually receives from relatives of victims. Writing about capital punishment, scholar Damien Horigan notes that rehabilitation is the main theme of A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story, and that witnessing such rehabilitation is the reason why King Pasenadi does not persecute A·πÖgulimƒÅla. In Sri Lankan pre-birth rituals, when the A·πÖgulimƒÅla Sutta is chanted for a pregnant woman, it is custom to surround her with objects symbolizing fertility and reproduction, such as parts of the coconut tree and earthen pots. Scholars have pointed out that in Southeast Asian mythology, there are links between bloodthirsty figures and fertility motifs. The shedding of blood can be found in both violence and childbirth, which explains why A·πÖgulimƒÅla is both depicted as a killer and a healer with regard to childbirth. With regard to the passage when the Buddha meets A·πÖgulimƒÅla, feminist scholar Liz Wilson concludes that the story is an example of cooperation and interdependence between the sexes: both the Buddha and A·πÖgulimƒÅla's mother help to stop him. Similarly, Thompson argues that mothers play an important role in the story, also citing the passage of the mother trying to stop A·πÖgulimƒÅla, as well as A·πÖgulimƒÅla healing a mother giving childbirth. Furthermore, both the Buddha and A·πÖgulimƒÅla take on motherly roles in the story. Although many ancient Indian stories associate women with qualities like foolishness and powerlessness, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story accepts feminine qualities, and the Buddha acts as a wise adviser to use those qualities in a constructive way. Nevertheless, Thompson does not consider the story feminist in any way, but does argue it contains a feminine kind of ethics of care, rooted in Buddhism.  In modern culture  upright=0.8 Throughout Buddhist history, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story has been depicted in many art forms, some of which can be found in museums and Buddhist heritage sites. In modern culture, A·πÖgulimƒÅla still plays an important role. In 1985, the British-born TheravƒÅda monk Ajahn Khemadhammo founded Angulimala, a Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy organization in the UK. It has been recognized by the British government as the official representative of the Buddhist religion in all matters concerning the British prison system, and provides chaplains, counselling services, and instruction in Buddhism and meditation to prisoners throughout England, Wales, and Scotland. The name of the organization refers to the power of transformation illustrated by A·πÖgulimƒÅla's story. According to the website of the organization, \\"The story of Angulimala teaches us that the possibility of Enlightenment may be awakened in the most extreme of circumstances, that people can and do change and that people are best influenced by persuasion and above all, example.\\" In popular culture, A·πÖgulimƒÅla's legend has received considerable attention. The story has been the main subject of at least three movies. In 2003, Thai director Suthep Tannirat attempted to release a film named Angulimala. Over 20 conservative Buddhist organizations in Thailand launched a protest, however, complaining that the movie distorted Buddhist teachings and history, and introduced Hindu and theistic influences not found in the Buddhist scriptures. The Thai film censorship board rejected appeals to ban the film, stating it did not distort Buddhist teachings. They did insist that the director cut two scenes of violent material. The conservative groups were offended by the depiction of A·πÖgulimƒÅla as a brutal murderer, without including the history which led him to become such a violent brigand. Tannirat defended himself, however, arguing that although he had omitted interpretations from the commentaries, he had followed the early Buddhist discourses precisely. Tannirat's choice to only use the early accounts, rather than the popular tales from the commentaries, was precisely what led to the protests. A·πÖgulimƒÅla has also been the subject of literary works. In 2006, peace activist Satish Kumar retold the story of A·πÖgulimƒÅla in his short book The Buddha and the Terrorist. The books deals with the Global War on Terror, reshaping and combining various accounts of A·πÖgulimƒÅla, who is described as a terrorist. The book emphasizes the passage when the Buddha accepts A·πÖgulimƒÅla in the monastic order, effectively preventing King Pasenadi from punishing him. In Kumar's book, this action leads to backlash from an enraged public, who demand to imprison both A·πÖgulimƒÅla and the Buddha. Pasenadi organizes a public trial in the presence of villagers and the royal court, in which the assembly can decide what to do with the two accused. In the end, however, the assembly decides to release the two, when A·πÖgulimƒÅla admits to his crimes and Pasenadi gives a speech emphasizing forgiveness rather than punishment. This twist in the story sheds a different light on A·πÖgulimƒÅla, whose violent actions ultimately lead to the trial and a more non-violent and just society. Writing about Buddhist texts and Kumar's book, Thompson reflects that ahi·πÉsa in Buddhism may have different shades of meaning in different contexts, and often does not mean passively standing by, or non-violence as usually understood. Finally, Angulimala is one of the protagonists in Karl Gjellerup‚Äôs novel Der Pilger Kamanita (The Pilgrim Kamanita, 1906) where he recounts the story of his conversion to Vasitthi who joins the Buddhist order the following day after a profuse alms-giving and after attending the exposition of the Buddhist teaching in the Si·πÉsapa Grove in the city of Kosambƒ´.Der Pilger Kamanita: Ein Legendenroman by Karl Gjellerup in Project Gutenberg, chapters XXXIII.

Construction began in 1917, and when it was completed in 1928, it was the largest integrated factory in the world. It inspired the GAZ factory built in the 1930s in the Soviet Union, as well as the later Hyundai factory complex in Ulsan, South Korea, which was developed beginning in the late 1960s. Designed by Albert Kahn, the Rouge was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1978 for its architecture and historical importance to the industry and economy of the United States. Structure The Rouge measures 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide by 1 mile (1.6 km) long, including 93 buildings with nearly 16 million square feet (1.5 km¬≤) of factory floor space. With its own docks in the dredged Rouge River, 100 miles (160 km) of interior railroad track, its own electricity plant, and integrated steel mill, the titanic Rouge was able to turn raw materials into running vehicles within this single complex, a prime example of vertical-integration production. More than 100,000 workers were employed there, even during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some of the Rouge buildings were designed by architect Albert Kahn. His Rouge glass plant was regarded at the time as an exemplary and humane factory building, with ample natural light provided through windows in the ceiling. Since the late 20th century, several buildings at the Rouge complex have been renovated and converted to \\"green\\" structures with a number of environmentally friendly features. In the summer of 1932, through Edsel Ford's support, Mexican artist Diego Rivera was invited to study the facilities at the Rouge. These studies informed his set of murals known as Detroit Industry, which have been on continuous display at the Detroit Institute of Arts since their completion in 1933. Production Interior of the Rouge Tool & Die works, 1944 The Rouge's first products were Eagle Boats, World War I anti-submarine warfare boats produced in Building B. The original Building B, a three-story structure, is part of the legendary Dearborn Assembly Plant, which started producing Model A's in the late 1920s and continued production through 2004. After the war, production turned to Fordson tractors. Although the Rouge produced nearly all the parts of the Model T, assembly of that vehicle remained at Highland Park. It was not until 1927 that automobile production began at the Rouge, with the introduction of the Ford Model A. During World War II the Rouge complex produced jeeps, aircraft engines, aircraft components and parts, tires and tubes, armor plate, and tractors. Other Rouge products included the 1932 Model B, the original Mercury, the Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Capri, and four decades of Ford Mustangs. The old assembly plant was idled with the construction and launch of a new assembly facility on the Miller Road side of the complex, currently producing Ford F-150 pickup trucks. The River Rouge Complex manufactured most of the components of Ford vehicles, starting with the Model T. Many of the vehicles were compiled into \\"knock-down kits\\", then sent by railroad to various assembly locations across the United States to be locally assembled, using local supplies as necessary. After the 1960s, Ford began to decentralize manufacturing, building several factories in major metropolitan centers. The Rouge was downsized, with units (including the famous furnaces and docks) sold off to independent companies, many still operating independently to this day. On May 26, 1937, a group of workers attempting to organize a union at the Rouge were severely beaten, an event later called the Battle of the Overpass. Peter E. Martin's respect for labor led to Walter Reuther, a UAW leader, allowing Martin to be the only Ford manager to retrieve his papers or gain access to the plant.Bryan, Ford: \\"Henry's Lieutenants\\", page 214, Wayne State University Press, 1993 The Rouge was one of only three locations where Ford manufactured the Mustang; the other sites were Metuchen Assembly and Milpitas Assembly in San Jose, California. By 1987, only Mustang production remained at the Dearborn Assembly Plant (DAP). In 1987 Ford planned to replace that car with the front wheel drive Ford Probe, but public outcry quickly turned to surging sales. With the fourth- generation Mustang a success, the Rouge was saved as well. Ford decided to modernize its operations. A gas explosion on February 1, 1999 killed six employees and injured two dozen more, resulting in the idling of the power plant. Michigan Utility CMS Energy built a state-of-the-art Power Plant across Miller Road to replace the electricity and steam production, as well as the blast furnace waste gas consumption of the original power plant As it ended production, Dearborn Assembly Plant was one of six plants within the Ford Rouge Center. The plant was open from 1918 to May 10, 2004, with a red convertible 2004 Ford Mustang GT being the last vehicle built at the historic site. Demolition of the historic DAP facility was completed in 2008. All that remains is a 3000 place parking lot to hold light truck production from the new Dearborn Truck Plant. Ford Rouge Center Lake freighters maneuver in the canal to unload ore at the plant, 1973 Today, the Rouge site is home to Ford's Rouge Center. This industrial park includes six Ford factories on 600 acres (2.4 km¬≤) of land, as well as steelmaking operations run by AK Steel, a U.S. steelmaker. The new Dearborn Truck factory famously features a vegetation-covered roof and rainwater reclamation system designed by sustainability architect William McDonough. This facility is still Ford's largest factory and employs some 6,000 workers. Mustang production, however, has moved to the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. Tours of the Rouge complex were a long tradition. Free bus tours of the facility began in 1924 and ran until 1980, at their peak hosting approximately a million visitors per year. They resumed in 2004 in cooperation with The Henry Ford Museum with multimedia presentations, as well as viewing of the assembly floor. The Ford Rouge Factory Tour had 148,000 visitors in 2017. The management of Dearborn Truck has decreed that no vehicles from other manufacturers may park at the front of the main employee lot. Non Ford Family vehicles are required to park in the back 12 rows of parking spaces. Hourly workers from both Ford and AK Steel facilities at the complex are represented by UAW Local 600. A fleet of three Ford-owned Great Lakes freighters initially named for the Ford grandsons and later renamed for top company executives, was based at the River Rouge Plant. When the ships were retired, one was scrapped, but the deckhouse of the SS William Clay Ford was relocated to a museum in the Belle Isle Detroit city park in the Detroit River and the deckhouse of the SS Benson Ford was transported by crane barge to Put-in-Bay, Ohio and placed on an 18-foot cliff as a private home above Lake Erie. Renovated architecture Ford Rouge Plant in 2019 Green roof in 2019 In 1999, architect William McDonough entered into an agreement with Ford Motor Company to redesign its 85-year-old, Rouge River facility. The roof of the 1.1 million square foot (100,000 m2) Dearborn truck assembly plant was covered with more than of sedum, a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy. The roof is part of an $18 million rainwater treatment system designed to collect and clean rainwater annually, sparing Ford from a $50 million mechanical treatment facility.

It is a modernized, open sourced and cross- platform version of the older Clipper system, which in turn developed from the dBase database market of the 1980s and 1990s. Harbour code using the same databases can be compiled under a wide variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, Unix variants, several BSD descendants, Mac OS X, MINIX 3, Windows CE, Pocket PC, Symbian, iOS, Android, QNX, VxWorks, OS/2 (including eComStation and ArcaOS), BeOS/Haiku, AIX and MS-DOS.  History  The idea of a free software Clipper compiler had been floating around for a long time and the subject has often cropped up in discussion on comp.lang.clipper. Antonio Linares founded the Harbour project and the implementation was started in March 1999. The name \\"Harbour\\" was proposed by Linares, it is a play on a Clipper as a type of ship. Harbour is a synonym for port (where ships dock), and Harbour is a port of the Clipper language. In 2009 Harbour was substantially redesigned, mainly by Viktor Szak√°ts and Przemyslaw Czerpak. Database support Harbour extends the Clipper Replaceable Database Drivers (RDD) approach. It offers multiple RDDs such as DBF, DBFNTX, DBFCDX, DBFDBT and DBFFPT. In Harbour multiple RDDs can be used in a single application, and new logical RDDs can be defined by combining other RDDs. The RDD architecture allows for inheritance, so that a given RDD may extend the functionality of other existing RDD(s). Third-party RDDs, like RDDSQL, RDDSIX, RMDBFCDX, Advantage Database Server, and Mediator exemplify some of the RDD architecture features. DBFNTX implementation has almost same functionality of DBFCDX and RDDSIX. NETIO and LetoDB provide remote access over TCP protocol. Harbour also offers ODBC support by means of an OOP syntax, and ADO support by means of OLE. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Oracle are examples of databases which Harbour can connect. xBase technologies often is confused with a RDBMS software. Although this is true, xBase is more than a simple database system as the same time xBase languages using purely DBF can not provide full concept of a real RDBMS. Programming philosophy Unlike Java which is intended to be write once, run anywhere, Harbour aims to be write once, compile anywhere. As the same compiler is available for all of the above operating systems, there is no need for recoding to produce identical products for different platforms, except when operating system dependent features are used. Cross-compiling is supported with MinGW. Under Microsoft Windows, Harbour is more stable but less well-documented than Clipper, but has multi-platform capability and is more transparent, customizable and can run from a USB flash drive. Under Linux and Windows Mobile, Clipper source code can be compiled with Harbour with very little adaptation. Most software originally written to run on Xbase++, FlagShip, FoxPro, xHarbour and others dialects can be compiled with Harbor with some adaptation. As 2010 many efforts have been made to turn the transition from other xBase dialects easier. Harbour can use the following C compilers, among others: GCC, MinGW, Clang, ICC, Microsoft Visual C++ (6.0+), Borland C++, Watcom C, Pelles C and Sun Studio. Harbour can make use of multiple Graphic Terminal emulations, including console drivers, and Hybrid Console/GUIs, such as GTWvt, and GTWvg. Harbour supports external GUIs, free (e.g. HBQt, HWGui, MiniGUI (latest version based on Qt) and QtContribs) and commercial (e.g. FiveWin, Xailer). HBQt is a library provinding bindings to Qt. HBIDE application is a sample of HBQt potential. Harbour is 100% Clipper-compatible and supports many language syntax extensions including greatly extended run-time libraries such as OLE, Blat, OpenSSL, FreeImage, GD, hbtip, hbtpathy, PCRE, hbmzip (zlib), hbbz2 (bzip2), cURL, Cairo, its own implementation of CA-Tools, updated NanFor libraries and many others. Harbour has an active development community and extensive third party support. Any xBase language provides a very productive way to build business and data intensive applications. Harbour is not an exception. Macro Operator (runtime compiler) One of the most powerful features of xBase languages is the Macro Operator '&'. Harbour's implementation of the Macro Operator allows for runtime compilation of any valid Harbour expression. Such a compiled expression may be used as a VALUE, i.e. the right side of an assignment (rvalue), but such a compiled expression may be used to resolve the left side (lvalue) of an assignment, i.e. private, or public variables, or a database field. Additionally, the Macro Operator may compile and execute function calls, complete assignments, or even list of arguments, and the result of the macro may be used to resolve any of the above contexts in the compiled application. In other words, any Harbour application may be extended and modified at runtime to compile and execute additional code on-demand. Latest Macro compiler can compile any valid Harbour code including code to pre-process before compile. Syntax: &( ... ) The text value of the expression '...' will be compiled, and the value resulting from the execution of the compiled code is the result. &SomeId; is the short form for &( SomeId ). &SomeId.postfix; is the short form of &( SomeId + \\"postfix\\" ). Object Oriented Programming Programming in an OOP style is a broader issue than a specific library or a specific interface, but OOP programming is something many Clipper programmers have come to expect. CA-Clipper 5.2 and especially 5.3 added a number of base classes, and a matching OOP syntax. Libraries such as Class(y), Fivewin, Clip4Win, and TopClass provide additional OOP functionality. Harbour has OOP extensions with full support for classes including inheritance, based on Class(y) syntax. OOP syntax in Harbour is very similar to that of earlier Clipper class libraries so it should be possible to maintain legacy Clipper code with minimal changes. Syntax and semantics Harbour code on HBIDE Harbour as every xBase language is case insensitive and can optionally accept keywords written just by first four characters. Built-in data types Harbour has 6 scalar types : Nil, String, Date, Logical, Numeric, Pointer, and 4 complex types: Array, Object, CodeBlock, and Hash. A scalar holds a single value, such as a string, numeric, or reference to any other type. Arrays are ordered lists of scalars or complex types, indexed by number, starting at 1. Hashes, or associative arrays, are unordered collections of any type values indexed by their associated key, which may be of any scalar or complex type. Literal (static) representation of scalar types: * Nil: * String: * Date: * Logical: * Numeric: Complex Types may also be represent as literal values: * Array: { \\"String\\", 1, { \\"Nested Array\\" }, .T., FunctionCall(), @FunctionPointer() } * CodeBlock: { Arg1, ArgN Arg1 := ArgN + OuterVar + FunctionCall() } * Hash: { \\"Name\\" => \\"John\\", 1 => \\"Numeric key\\", { \\"Nested\\" => \\"Hash\\" } } Hashes may use any type including other Hashes as the Key for any element. Hashes and Arrays may contain any type as the Value of any member, including nesting arrays, and Hashes. Codeblocks may have references to Variables of the Procedure/Function>method in which it was defined. Such Codeblocks may be returned as a value, or by means of an argument passed , in such case the Codeblock will \\"outlive\\" the routine in which it was defined, and any variables it references, will be a variable. Detached variables will maintain their value for as long as a Codeblock referencing them still exists. Such values will be shared with any other Codeblock which may have access to those same variables. If the Codeblock did not outlive its containing routine, and will be evaluated within the lifetime of the routine in which it is defined, changes to its Detached Variables(s) by means of its evaluation, will be reflected back at its parent routine. Codeblocks can be evaluated any number of times, by means of the function. Variables All types can be assigned to named variables. Named variable identifiers are 1 to 63 ASCII characters long, start with \`[A-Z_]\` and further consist of the characters \`[A-Z0‚Äì9_]\` up to a maximum of 63 characters. Named variables are not case sensitive. Variables have one of the following scopes: * : Visible only within the routine which declared it. Value is lost upon exit of the routine. * : Visible only within the routine which declared it. Value is preserved for subsequent invocations of the routine. If a STATIC variable is declared before any Procedure/Function/Method is defined, it has a MODULE scope, and is visible within any routine defined within that same source file, it will maintain its life for the duration of the application lifetime. * : Visible within the routine which declared it, and all routines by that routine. * : Visible by routines in the same application. and are resolved at compile time, and thus are much faster than and variables which are dynamic entities accessed by means of a runtime Symbol table. For this same reason, and variables are exposed to the Macro compiler, and any macro code which attempts to reference them will generate a runtime error. Due to the dynamic nature of and variables, they can be created and destroyed at runtime, can be accessed and modified by means of runtime macros, and can be accessed and modified by Codeblocks created on the fly. Control structures The basic control structures include all of the standard dBase, and Clipper control structures as well as additional ones inspired by the C or Java programming languages: =Loops= [DO] WHILE ConditionExp ... [LOOP] [EXIT] END[DO] FOR Var := InitExp TO EndExp [STEP StepExp] ... [LOOP] [EXIT] NEXT FOR EACH Var IN CollectionExp ... [Var:__enumIndex()] [LOOP] [EXIT] NEXT * The ... is a sequence of one of more Harbour statements, and square brackets \`[]\` denote optional syntax. * The Var:__enumIndex() may be optionally used to retrieve the current iteration index (1 based). * The LOOP statement restarts the current iteration of the enclosing loop structure, and if the enclosing loop is a FOR or FOR EACH loop, it increases the iterator, moving to the next iteration of the loop. * The EXIT statement immediately terminates execution of the enclosing loop structure. * The NEXT statement closes the control structure and moves to the next iteration of loop structure. In the FOR statement, the assignment expression is evaluated prior to the first loop iteration. The TO expression is evaluated and compared against the value of the control variable, prior to each iteration, and the loop is terminated if it evaluates to a numeric value greater than the numeric value of the control variable. The optional STEP expression is evaluated after each iteration, prior to deciding whether to perform the next iteration. In FOR EACH, the Var variable will have the value (scalar, or complex) of the respective element in the collection value. The collection expression, may be an Array (of any type or combinations of types), an Hash Table, or an Object type. =IF statements= IF CondExp ... [ELSEIF] CondExp ... [ELSE] ... END[IF] ... represents 0 or more statement(s). The condition expression(s) has to evaluate to a LOGICAL value. =SWITCH statements= Harbour supports a SWITCH construct inspired by the C implementation of switch(). SWITCH SwitchExp CASE LiteralExp ... [EXIT] [CASE LiteralExp] ... [EXIT] [OTHERWISE] ... END[SWITCH] * The LiteralExp must be a compiled time resolvable numeric expression, and may involve operators, as long as such operators involve compile time static value. * The EXIT optional statement is the equivalent of the C statement break, and if present, execution of the SWITCH structure will end when the EXIT statement is reached, otherwise it will continue with the first statement below the next CASE statement (fall through). =BEGIN SEQUENCE statements= BEGIN SEQUENCE ... [BREAK] [Break( [Exp] )] RECOVER [USING Var] ... END[SEQUENCE] or: BEGIN SEQUENCE ... [BREAK] [Break()] END[SEQUENCE] The BEGIN SEQUENCE structure allows for a well behaved abortion of any sequence, even when crossing nested procedures/functions. This means that a called procedure/function, may issue a BREAK statement, or a Break() expression, to force unfolding of any nested procedure/functions, all the way back to the first outer BEGIN SEQUENCE structure, either after its respective END statement, or a RECOVER clause if present. The Break statement may optionally pass any type of expression, which may be accepted by the RECOVER statement to allow further recovery handing. Additionally the Harbour Error Object supports canDefault, canRetry and canSubstitute properties, which allows error handlers to perform some preparations, and then request a Retry Operation, a Resume, or return a Value to replace the expression triggering the error condition. Alternatively TRY [CATCH] [FINALLY] statements are available on xhb library working like the SEQUENCE construct. Procedures/Functions [STATIC] PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName [STATIC] PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName() [STATIC] PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName( Param1 [, ParamsN] ) INIT PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName EXIT PROCEDURE SomeProcedureName [STATIC] FUNCTION SomeProcedureName [STATIC] FUNCTION SomeProcedureName() [STATIC] FUNCTION SomeProcedureName( Param1 [, ParamsN] ) Procedures/Functions in Harbour can be specified with the keywords \`PROCEDURE\`, or \`FUNCTION\`. Naming rules are same as those for Variables (up to 63 characters non-case sensitive). Both Procedures and Functions may be qualified by the scope qualifier STATIC to restrict their usage to the scope of the module where defined. The INIT or EXIT optional qualifiers, will flag the procedure to be automatically invoked just before calling the application startup procedure, or just after quitting the application, respectively. Parameters passed to a procedure/function appear in the subroutine as local variables, and may accept any type, including references. Changes to argument variables are not reflected in respective variables passed by the calling procedure/function/method unless explicitly passed BY REFERENCE using the @ prefix. PROCEDURE have no return value, and if used in an Expression context will produce a NIL value. FUNCTION may return any type by means of the RETURN statement, anywhere in the body of its definition. An example procedure definition and a function call follows: x := Cube( 2 ) FUNCTION Cube( n ) RETURN n ** 3 Sample code The typical \\"hello world\\" program would be: ? \\"Hello, world!\\" Or: QOut( \\"Hello, world!\\" ) Or: Alert( \\"Hello, world!\\" ) Or, enclosed in an explicit procedure: PROCEDURE Main() ? \\"Hello, world!\\" RETURN =OOP examples= Main procedure: #include \\"hbclass.ch\\" PROCEDURE Main() LOCAL oPerson CLS oPerson := Person():New( \\"Dave\\" ) oPerson:Eyes := \\"Invalid\\" oPerson:Eyes := \\"Blue\\" Alert( oPerson:Describe() ) RETURN Class definition: CREATE CLASS Person VAR Name INIT \\"\\" METHOD New( cName ) METHOD Describe() ACCESS Eyes INLINE ::pvtEyes ASSIGN Eyes( x ) INLINE iif( HB_ISSTRING( x ) .AND. x $ \\"Blue,Brown,Green\\", ::pvtEyes := x, Alert( \\"Invalid value\\" ) ) PROTECTED: VAR pvtEyes ENDCLASS // Sample of normal Method definition METHOD New( cName ) CLASS Person ::Name := cName RETURN Self METHOD Describe() CLASS Person LOCAL cDescription IF Empty( ::Name ) cDescription := \\"I have no name yet.\\" ELSE cDescription := \\"My name is: \\" + ::Name + \\";\\" ENDIF IF !

Development HBIDE look. Today Harbour development is led by Viktor Szak√°ts in collaboration with Przemys≈Çaw Czerpak who also contributes many components of the core language and supplementary components. HBIDE and some other components especially HBQt, are developed by Pritpal Bedi. Other members of the development community send changes to the GitHub source repository. As of 2015 Harbour development is active and vibrant. xHarbour comparison xHarbour is a fork of the earlier Harbour project. xHarbour takes a more aggressive approach to implementing new features in the language, while Harbour is more conservative in its approach, aiming first of all for an exact replication of Clipper behaviour and then implementing new features and extensions as a secondary consideration. It should also be noted that Harbour is supported on a wide variety of operating systems while xHarbour only really supports MS Windows and Linux 32-bit. The Harbour developers have attempted to document all hidden behaviour in the Clipper language and test Harbour-compiled code alongside the same code compiled with Clipper to maintain compatibility. The Harbour developers explicitly reject extensions to the language where those extensions would break Clipper compatibility. These rejections were softened recently since the new Harbour architecture allows extensions out of the core compiler. A detailed comparison between extensions implemented in Harbour and xHarbour can be found in the source repository of the project on GitHub.

Morris is a fictional character in Bram Stoker's 1897 horror novel Dracula. In the novel He is a rich young American from Texas, and one of the three men who propose to Lucy Westenra. Quincey is friends with her other two suitors, Arthur Holmwood and Dr. John Seward, even after Lucy has chosen Arthur, as well as Jonathan Harker. He carries a Bowie knife at all times, and at one point he admits that he is a teller of tall tales and 'a rough fellow, who hasn't perhaps lived as a man should' (Dracula Chapter 25). Quincey is the last person to donate his blood to Lucy before her death. Aside from Dracula, Quincey is the only major character not to keep some form of journal. Quincey is one of the few characters in Dracula to have prior knowledge of blood drinkers. In chapter 12, he mentions that he was forced to shoot his horse while in the Pampas after vampire bats drank it dry during the night. Quincey plays an important role in the climax of the novel. He and Jonathan Harker are the ones who finally destroy Count Dracula. Quincey is gravely injured in the final battle with Count Dracula and his minions and dies shortly afterwards. In gratitude for his efforts, Harker and his wife, Mina Harker, name their son Quincey. Quincey Morris, Vampire (\\"The Wind Breathes Cold\\") In 1991, author P. N. Elrod wrote a short story called \\"The Wind Breathes Cold\\" which appeared in the anthology Dracula: Prince of Darkness (). In the story, Morris, who had been killed in the process of destroying Dracula (who had fled back to Transylvania when his plans for establishing a residence in England failed), awakens in the night to discover that, as the result of an old affair with a woman who turned out to be a vampire, he himself has become a vampire. Dracula confronts him, explaining that they belong to what effectively amounts to two different species of vampires and that many of Dracula's weaknesses (crosses, garlic, and other anti-vampire paraphernalia) are the price for his additional powers. The story ends with Quincey returning to the castle with Dracula for a short time to adjust to what has happened to him. In 2001, Elrod expanded the chapter into a full novel (Baen Paperbacks, 2001, ) with Quincey leaving Transylvania and traveling first to Paris, then on to London in the hopes of convincing his friends that he's not the evil monster Van Helsing has painted him to be. Terovolas In author Edward M. Erdelac's epistolary sequel to Dracula, Terovolas, Van Helsing returns the earthly remains and personal effects of Quincey to his ancestral ranch in the fictional Sorefoot, Texas. There, Professor Van Helsing becomes embroiled in another preternatural caper with Quincey's estranged younger brother, Cole Morris. In media=In literature *Author Justin Gustainis has a series about a great grandson of the Dracula character, who is also named Quincey Morris. To get around the original's apparent bachelorhood in Dracula, Gustainis makes him a widower whose wife died in child birth. He is supernatural investigator. * In 1991, author P. N.

On screen Most film adaptations of the novel omit Quincey altogether. In the 1977 adaptation Count Dracula, he is merged with the Arthur Holmwood character and renamed Quincey Holmwood. To date, Morris has been portrayed in film and television by: * Jack Taylor in Count Dracula (1970)-here he is Englishman and Lucy‚Äôs fianc√© * Richard Barnes (as Quincey Holmwood) in Count Dracula (1977)-here he is Lucy‚Äôs fianc√© * Billy Campbell in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) - he is portrayed faithfully to his counterpart in the novel. * Alessio Boni in Dracula (2002) - here the events are updated to modern times and Quincey is a businessman specialising in money swindles. * Keir Knight in Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary (2002) *Krash Miller in Dracula Reborn (2012) - here the events take place in modern-day California and Quincey tries to destroy Dracula in revenge for killing Quincey's girlfriend Lucy. * Phil Dunster in BBC's Dracula miniseries (2020) - here he is re-imagined as a modern day rich American and a boyfriend, then fiance, of Lucy Westenra. He doesn't seem to care much about Lucy herself, mostly cares about her looks, leaves right after her funeral and doesn't take any important part in the plot. On stage * Quincey Morris appears in Dracula, the Musical by Frank Wildhorn. Here his portrayal is faithful to the novel. He was played by Lee Morgan in Broadway production of the musical. Games In the Castlevania video game series, Quincey is a distant relative of the series' main heroes, the Belmonts. In addition, two games, Castlevania Bloodlines and Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, feature his son John and grandson Jonathan as their respective protagonists, in which they hunt the resurrected Dracula with the Belmonts' family weapon, the Vampire Killer whip. How exactly Quincey had a son remains to be explained. In the full motion video based game Dracula Unleashed, the protagonist is Quincey's brother Alexander Morris. The plot involves Alexander's investigation of his brother's death. Quincey also appears to Alexander in a dream sequence. Both brothers are played by Bill Williamson in the game.

They were developed in the 19th century as a healthful and comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses worn by American women. They take their name from their best-known advocate, the women's rights activist Amelia Bloomer. Fashion bloomers (skirted) 1851 caricature of fashion bloomers Bloomers were an innovation of readers of the Water-Cure Journal, a popular health periodical that in October 1849 began urging women to develop a style of dress that was not so harmful to their health as the current fashion. It also represented an unrestricted movement, unprecedented by previous women's fashions, that allowed for greater freedom‚Äîboth metaphorical and physical‚Äîwithin the public sphere. The fashionable dress of that time consisted of a skirt that dragged several inches on the floor, worn over layers of starched petticoats stiffened with straw or horsehair sewn into the hems. In addition to the heavy skirts, prevailing fashion called for a \\"long waist\\" effect, achieved with a whale- bone-fitted corset that pushed the wearer's internal organs out of their normal place. The result was a feminine population which, as one medical professor warned his students, was of no use as cadavers from which to study human anatomy.Water-Cure Journal, reprinted in Lily, March 1851. Women responded with a variety of costumes, many inspired by the pantaloons of Turkey, and all including some form of pants. By the summer of 1850, various versions of a short skirt and trousers, or \\"Turkish dress\\", were being worn by readers of the Water-Cure Journal as well as women patients at the nation's health resorts. After wearing the style in private, some began wearing it in public. In the winter and spring of 1851, newspapers across the country carried startled sightings of the dresses.Reprints in Lily, March, May, June 1851. Bloomer craze of 1851 In a reversal of genders, a \\"bloomer\\" asks her fianc√©'s shocked father for consent to marry his son: satirical cartoon from 1852 In February 1851, Elizabeth Smith Miller of Peterboro, New York, wore the \\"Turkish dress\\"Elizabeth Cady Stanton's husband wrote to her, asking, \\"How does Lib Miller look in her new Turkish dress?\\" Henry B. Stanton to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Stanton Papers, Library of Congress, Film 1:68. to the Seneca Falls, New York, home of Amelia Bloomer and her temperance journal, The Lily. The next month Bloomer announced to her readers that she had adopted the dress and, in response to many inquiries, printed a description of her dress and instructions on how to make it. By June many newspapers had dubbed it the \\"Bloomer dress\\".To assertions that she was the innovator of the dress, Bloomer replied: \\"The first we heard of it, it was worn as an exercise dress at the Water-Cures; the first article we saw advocating it was an editorial in the Seneca County Courier, [Jan. 1851], which article we transferred to our columns; the first person we saw wearing such a dress was Mrs. Charles D. Miller of Peterboro, daughter of Gerrit Smith, who has worn it for the last five or six months\\", Lily, June 1851, p. 45. During the summer of 1851, the nation was seized by a \\"bloomer craze\\". Health reformer Mary Gove Nichols drafted a Declaration of Independence from the Despotism of Parisian Fashion and gathered signatures to it at lectures on woman's dress.Liberator, July 1851, p. 124. Managers of the textile mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, gave a banquet for any of their female workers who adopted the safer dress before July 4.Lowell Courier, reprinted in Lily, July 1851, p. 53. In Toledo, Ohio, sixty women turned out in Turkish costume at one of the city's grandest social events.Toledo Republican, reprinted in Lily, August 1851, p. 60. Bloomer balls and bloomer picnics were held; dress reform societies and bloomer institutes were formed.Lily, Aug., Oct., Nov. 1851 A grand festival in favor of the costume was held at New York City's Broadway Tabernacle in September.Water- Cure Journal, August 1851. In August, a woman who had spent six months sailing from Philadelphia around the Horn to California with the reform dress packed in her trunk disembarked to find that the dress had preceded her and was being displayed in the window of a San Francisco dress shop.Tinling, Marian, \\"Bloomerism Comes to California\\", California History 61 (spring 1982): 21.  Bloomers in London  Interest in the bloomers was also sparked in England when Hannah Tracy Cutler and other women delegates wore the new dress to an international peace convention in London.Lily, Nov. 1851. Many newspaper reports were dedicated to the controversy the outfit caused. One prominent figure who began to lecture about the bloomers in London and beyond was Caroline Dexter. When she and her husband later emigrated to Australia, she continued to advocate for dress reform. Although few women are known to have worn the bloomers in Australia, Dexter's continued support led to controversy in the Sydney Morning Herald. Women's rights Bloomer Costume (Robert Chambers, The Book of Days, 1864) The Bloomer also became a symbol of women's rights in the early 1850s. The same women‚ÄîElizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony‚Äîwho adopted the new form of dress also advocated women's right to vote. These women preferred to call their new style the \\"freedom dress.\\" Crowds gathered to not only hear these women's radical words, but also to see their \\"scandalous\\" mode of dress. After three years, however, fearing that the new dress was drawing attention away from the suffragist cause, many of these women returned to corsets, long skirts, and more conventional forms of dress. In similar suit, the Dress Reform Association which was formed in 1856 called the outfit the \\"American costume\\" and focused on its health benefits rather than its political symbolism. Following the American Civil War, interest in the Bloomer costume waned almost completely until its resurgence in the 1890s. In the 1850s, the \\"bloomer\\" was a physical and metaphorical representation of feminist reform. This garment originated in late 1849 for the purpose of developing a style of dress for women that was less harmful to their health. Because it was less restricting than the previously popular attire, the bloomer provided more physical freedom for women. Being a completely new and distinctively different form of dress, the bloomer garment also provided women with a metaphorical freedom, in the sense that it gave women not only more diverse dress options, but also the opportunity and power to choose their type of garment. Some individuals at the time even argued that the Bloomer dress should be adopted for moral reasons. A reporter noted that a group of \\"very intelligent appearing, lady-like women\\" met in Milford, Massachusetts in July 1852. The purpose of this meeting was to consider the propriety of adopting bloomers. The women unanimously passed a resolution approving the costume, declaring the currently existing fashion to be consistent with \\"moral evils\\" and arguing that the bloomer would facilitate women's efforts to engage in good works.\\"Kriebl, Karen. \\"From Bloomers to Flappers: The American Women's Dress Reform Movement, 1840‚Äì1920.\\" Electronic Thesis or Dissertation. Ohio State University, 1998. OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center. 18 Apr 2014. Feminists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and numerous others, essentially claimed that women who took on the \\"feminist dress\\" look without being fully knowledgeable of all the accompanying issues were imposters. They were concerned that individuals could demonstrate reform without actually being an expert in the issues. In the Sibyl poem, the feeling and element of reform was demonstrated through simplicity and the subtle appreciation of this small step in women's fashion in parallel to a small step for women in general. During the 1850s, feminist reformers were fighting numerous battles to bring about change and further equality to women everywhere. Feminists believed that it was more important to focus on the issues, and that giving in to fashionable trends was exactly what they were battling against. This now popularized simple change in dress symbolically furthered women's liberation. Opposition to Bloomer dress Bloomer's promotion of the style as a freedom dress rather than as a health dress did nothing to recommend it to the orthodox clergy and other critics of the woman's rights movement, who denounced the wearing of pants by women as a usurpation of male authority.Noun, Louise, \\"Amelia Bloomer, A Biography, Part I, The Lily of Seneca Falls\\", Annals of Iowa, 7 (winter 1985), pp. 598‚Äì99; Tinling, p. 24. Associating it with the woman's rights movement, the New York Sunday Mercury published a woodcarving representing the woman's rights convention held in Akron, Ohio, in May 1851. It depicted every woman in coat, breeches, and high boots, sitting cross-legged and smoking cigars, when in truth not a bloomer was present.History of Woman Suffrage, 1: 815. Some young women were denied church membership for wearing the dress.New York Daily Tribune, reprinted in Lily, July 8, 1851, p. 6. Public meetings were called to put down the fad, and the very same newspapers that had previously praised the dress began ridiculing and condemning \\"Bloomerism\\". In August 1851, Harper's Monthly reprinted a cartoon and article from a London newspaper ridiculing the American dress, one month after it had printed a sketch of the \\"Oriental Costume\\" and pronounced it tasteful, elegant, and graceful. Bloomers in the West Lucy Stone, one of America's most famous orators in the woman's rights movement during the 1850s, helped popularize the dress by wearing it as she addressed immense audiences in over twenty states, the District of Columbia, and Ontario between 1851 and 1855. She had begun wearing the dress as a health measure while recuperating from typhoid fever during the winter of 1850‚Äì51, and she wore it exclusively for three years.Million, Joelle, Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement. Praeger, 2003. , pp. 114, 135, 159‚Äì62. In 1856 a National Dress Reform Association organizedLiberator, March 14, 1856, p. 44; Water-Cure Journal, April 1856, p. 81. and one of its officers, Dr. Lydia Sayer Hasbrouck, who had worn the dress since 1849, established a journal, The Sibyl, as the society's organ. From July 1856 through June 1864, that paper carried news of dress reform to subscribers from New England to California and published the names of nearly a thousand women who sent in their names as wearers of the reform dress.The Sibyl, July 15, 1859, pp. 588‚Äì89 A letter-writer from Iowa said it was especially suited for life on the prairie and reported that many women from various parts of the state wore it all the time. Readers from Illinois, Arkansas, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, and Oregon attested to its popularity among western women.The Sibyl, July, August, 1856 In 1860, an English traveler reported meeting a bloomer wearer in Laramie, Wyoming, and a traveler to Pike's Peak reported that \\"the bloomer costume is considerably in vogue and appears peculiarly adapted to overland travel\\".Tinling, p. 23. Civil War nurses and the bloomer When Dorothea Dix was appointed superintendent of army nurses in June 1861, she issued a statement banning the bloomer from army hospitals and requiring women to abandon it before entering nursing service. But as western communities organized battalions of soldiers, they also formed corps of volunteer nurses to accompany them, and many of these nurses adopted the reform dress for field service. All members of one such corps, organized by Dr. Fedelia Harris Reid of Berlin, Wisconsin, and called the \\"Wisconsin Florence Nightengale Union\\", wore the bloomer not only in the field, but also while caring for patients at a military hospital in St. Louis. Four bloomer wearers were among the nurses who accompanied Minnesota's First Regiment.The Sibyl, May 1, June 1 and 15, July 15, Oct., 1861 Dr. Mary E. Walker, who earned the Congressional Medal of Honor for her medical services during the Civil War, wore the reform dress while working in a military hospital in Washington, D.C., as well as for field work. As she accompanied troops in the South, she wrote to the Sibyl that New Orleans women of wealth and standing had worn it to Haiti and Cuba.\\"Letter from Dr. Walker\\", The Sibyl, Nov. 1862, p. 1092. The dress was still being worn by members of the utopian Oneida Community in 1867Holloway, Mark, Heavens on earth: Utopian Communes in America, 1680‚Äì1880, Dover Publications, 1966, p. 192. but gradually it was abandoned by all but a very few stalwart wearers willing to defy society's mores. Bloomers and bicycles In 1893, the Woman's Congress of the World's Columbian Exposition revived interest in the bloomer as an aid in improving women's health through physical exercise. Their session on women's dress opened with Lucy Stone reminiscing about the bloomer movement of the 1850s; her extolling the bloomer as the \\"cleanest, neatest, most comfortable and most sensible garment\\" she had ever worn; and young women modeling different versions of the dress.\\"Dress Her Theme\\", Chicago Times, May 17, 1893. The following year Annie \\"Londonderry\\" Cohen Kopchovsky donned the bloomer during her famous bicycle trip around the world, and an updated version of the bloomer soon became the standard \\"bicycle dress\\" for women during the bicycle craze of the 1890s.Marks, Patricia, Bicycles, Bangs, and Bloomers: The New Woman in the Popular Press, University Press of Kentucky, 1990. In 1909, fashion designer Paul Poiret attempted to popularize harem pants worn below a long flaring tunic, but this attempted revival of fashion bloomers under another name did not catch on. Athletic bloomers (unskirted)=19th and 20th centuries During the late 19th century, athletic bloomers (also known as \\"rationals\\" or \\"knickerbockers\\") were skirtless baggy knee-length trousers, fastened to the leg a little below the knees; at that time, they were worn by women only in a few narrow contexts of athletic activity, such as bicycle-riding, gymnastics, and sports other than tennis (see 1890s in fashion). Bloomers were usually worn with stockings and after 1910 often with a sailor middy blouse. Bloomers became shorter by the late 1920s. In the 1930s, when it became respectable for women to wear pants and shorts in a wider range of circumstances, styles imitating men's shorts were favored, and bloomers tended to become less common. However, baggy knee- length gym shorts fastened at or above the knees continued to be worn by girls in school physical education classes through to the 1950s in some areas. Some schools in New York City and Sydney still wore them as part of their uniforms into the 1980s. In Japan their use persisted into the early 2000s.http://www.chaipin.edu The Bloomington, Illinois, entry in the Three-I League of minor league baseball, despite being an all-male team, was tagged with the nickname \\"Bloomers\\" for several decades in the early 1900s. Bloomers in Japan Known as buruma („Éñ„É´„Éû), also burumƒÅ („Éñ„É´„Éû„Éº), bloomers were introduced in Japan as women's clothing for physical education in 1903.Allen Guttmann and Lee Thompson, Japanese sports: a history, University of Hawaii Press, 2001, pp. 93ff. . After the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a newer style of bloomers which fit the body closer, similar to volleyball uniforms, became commonplace. Around the mid-1990s, however, schools and individuals began to choose sports shorts instead, citing modesty concerns.Ichiro Takahashi, et al., Social History of Bloomers: a Vision to Physical Education for Women, Seiky≈´sha, 2005, chap. 4. .

Undergarments Women's baggy underpants fastened to just below or above the knee are also known as \\"bloomers\\" (or as \\"knickers\\" or \\"directoire knickers\\"). They were most popular from the 1910s to the 1930s but continued to be worn by older women for several decades thereafter. Often the term bloomers has been used interchangeably with the pantalettes worn by women and girls in the mid-19th century and the open-leg knee-length drawers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It is beside the River Thames opposite the market town of Wallingford, the two linked by Wallingford Bridge. Crowmarsh parish also includes the hamlet of Newnham Murren, which is now merged with the village; the hamlet of Mongewell, and the village of North Stoke to the south. History After the Norman Conquest of England most of the land was granted to Walter Giffard, later Earl of Buckingham. It later came into the possession of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and remained with his heirs until passing back to the Crown. Nearby Newnham Manor was originally granted by William the Conqueror to Miles Crispin, but by 1428 was owned by Thomas Chaucer, son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. After his death it was passed to his daughter Alice, wife of William de la Pole, 4th Earl of Suffolk. Other land was granted to Battle Abbey. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary Magdalene is said to have been built in about 1120. The north door, south door, three windows in the south wall, chancel arch and font are all Norman. A north transept with a pointed arch was added in about 1200. The building was restored in 1836 and 1868.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 561 In 1139 King Stephen built a wooden fort in Crowmarsh, the first of a series built in opposition to Wallingford Castle, which supported his cousin Matilda during the civil war known as The Anarchy.

A sequel, Project Gotham Racing 4, was released in October 2007. Cities Project Gotham Racing 3 offers players four cities‚ÄîLas Vegas, London, New York City, and Tokyo‚Äîas well as the N√ºrburgring to race through. Project Gotham Racing 3 features 80 licensed cars from over 30 manufacturers such as Ferrari, Dodge, and Lamborghini. The polygons used to make up a car model increases in Project Gotham Racing 3, to between 80-100,000. The increased polygon count allows for smoother, less jagged-shaped cars than in earlier games. Of the 80 cars in the game, 71 are unlocked and available for play at the start of a new game, while the remaining 9 (prototypes, one-offs, and concept) cars are left for the player to unlock. In a change from the previous two games, Project Gotham Racing 3 emphasizes supercars and special models instead of generic production cars (cars with a top speed of over 170 mph). One of the starter cars is the Acura NSX. Similar to its predecessors, each car in Project Gotham Racing 3 is allocated to a specific class. There are five classes, A through E, the high performance cars being Class A, and the low performance cars in Class E. Kudos once again play an important part in Project Gotham. Kudos points are given for stylish driving, for example drifting around a corner, drafting, or getting two or four wheels off the ground. When combos are linked up, the player is given a bonus for keeping them linked together, and this builds up to huge amounts if the combo is held for a substantial length of time. This bonus is, however, lost if the player crashes into any barriers, though the base Kudos (all but the combo bonus) are kept. Multiplayer Project Gotham Racing 3 allows multiplayer offline with up to two players on one Xbox 360 console or more players via System Link.

It has 16 buttons on each side, plus 1 at the collar to make a total of 33: the traditional number of years in the earthly life of Jesus (Benaki Museum, Athens, Greece). Greek-Catholic bishop wearing a sakkos. What appears to be a collar is a separate vestment, called the omophorion (Pre≈°ov, Slovakia). The sakkos (Greek: œÉŒ¨Œ∫Œ∫ŒøœÇ, \\"sackcloth\\") is a vestment worn by Orthodox and Greek Catholic bishops instead of the priest's phelonion. The garment is a tunic with wide sleeves, and a distinctive pattern of trim. It reaches below the knees and is fastened up the sides with buttons or tied with ribbons. It is similar in form to the western dalmatic, which is similarly derived from Byzantine dress. The sakkos was originally worn by the Emperor as an imperial vestment, symbolizing the tunic of disgrace worn by Christ during his trial and mockery. The sakkos is usually made of a rich brocade fabric and may be intricately embroidered. There is normally a cross in the center of the back, which the bishop kisses before it is placed on him. Buttons or loops are sewn on the back, by which the bishop's omophorion (either great or small) may be attached. Traditionally, bells are attached to the sakkos, following the biblical directions for the vestments of the Jewish High Priest (; ). History Originally, all bishops wore a phelonion similar to the one worn by priests, but woven or embroidered with a multilayered cross pattern called the polystavrion (\\"many-crosses\\"). The use of the sakkos was a privilege bestowed by the Basileus (Emperor) upon individual patriarchs as a sign of his personal favor. The first literary evidence for the garment is found in the writings of Theodore Balsamon, Patriarch of Antioch (ca. 1130‚Äì1140). By the 13th century it worn by all the patriarchs and a few high-ranking archbishops‚Äîbut only on Easter and the Great Feasts of Pentecost and Nativity; other bishops continued to wear the polystavrion. After the Fall of Constantinople (1453) it came into general use by bishops along with the mitre, derived from the Imperial crown, as a sign of their temporal authority within the Rum millet of the Ottoman Empire. The sakkos is now worn by all Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic bishops, regardless of rank. Unlike Western pontificalia which may be worn by prelates who are not bishops‚Äîprovided they have the privilege of doing so‚Äîthe sakkos may only be worn by a bishop. Use Sakkos of Photius, Metropolitan of Moscow, ca. 1417 The bishop wears the sakkos when he vests fully to celebrate the Divine Liturgy, at the Great Doxology at Matins when there is an All-Night Vigil, or on specific other occasions when called for by the rubrics (for instance, at the bringing out of the Epitaphios on Great and Holy Friday, or the cross on the Great Feast of the Exaltation). At other services, he will wear the episcopal mantle (Greek: ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œçŒ±œÇ, Mand√Ωas, Old Church Slavonic: Mantiya). When the bishop is vested, the sakkos is presented to him on a tray. He blesses it with both hands, and two subdeacons lift it off the tray, hold it for him to kiss the cross on the back, place it on him and button the sides (as shown here). The epigonation, which was placed on the bishop first, is lifted up as the sakkos is buttoned, so that it remains visible on the outside. During the vesting with the sakkos, the protodeacon swings the censer and says the Prayer of the Sakkos: > Thy high priests shall by clothed in glory, and Thy saints shall rejoice > with joy, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. This prayer is identical to that used by a priest when he vests in the phelonion, except that instead of saying \\"Thy high priests\\", a priest says simply, \\"Thy priests\\". In some traditions, a bishop may choose to celebrate the Liturgy \\"as a priest\\"; meaning he does not vest in full episcopal vestments, nor does he make use of the dikirion and trikirion (episcopal candlesticks). Instead of the sakkos he wears a priestly phelonion, with only the small omophorion on his shoulders and the epigonation at his side. The bishop will in this instance, as always, wear his Panagia enkolpion, and will stand on the eagle rug. Moreover, certain ceremonial practices are not observed as they would be for a full hierarchal service. A bishop may theoretically always use the phelonion rather than the sakkos, but this is very rarely done. A notable instance where the phelonion is always used is in the Liturgy of St. James. The phelonion was originally used by both the presbyters and the bishops of the church. However, as the Roman Empire drew to a close, the Ecumenical Patriarch began wearing the sakkos, due to being the \\"Ecumenical\\" Patriarch, that is, the Patriarch of the imperial capital and most of the Empire. After the Empire fell, the Turks appointed most Orthodox Bishops to wear the sakkos. This was also the period in which Orthodox Bishops began wearing imperial mitres and also were seated on a throne off to the side, rather than the center near where the original ambo would have been. The Slavic Churches retain standing the Bishops in the center of the Church, but during various reforms, began wearing mitres and the sakkos as the Greeks did. However, the Russian Patriarch/Metropolitan already wore a mitre similar to the one he wears today, and other Russian Bishops adopted the mitres of the Greeks only later.

She is best known for her appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling from 1995 to 2001 and with World Wrestling Entertainment in 2005 and 2006. During her tenure with ECW, Francine managed several of the promotion's top wrestlers.  Early life  Francine was born on February 19, 1972. She grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she attended West Catholic Preparatory High School in West Philadelphia. She became a fan of professional wrestling as a teenager, attending events at the Spectrum. While working for a life insurance company in 1993, Francine saw a television commercial for the \\"House of Hardcore\\", the professional wrestling school run by Extreme Championship Wrestling, on SportsChannel Philadelphia and decided to enroll as she \\"didn't want to be stuck behind a desk\\". Professional wrestling career= Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994‚Äì2001)  Francine trained with J.T. Smith at House of Hardcore. During her training she made a handful of appearances on the independent circuit. After seven months, she began appearing on ECW house shows. Francine made her first ECW in-ring appearance in 1994 under the name \\"Miss Montgomeryville\\", portraying a beauty pageant winner who acted as a guest timekeeper until being chokeslammed by 911. Early into her ECW career, Francine was approached by the World Wrestling Federation about joining the promotion as \\"Sister Love\\", a valet for Brother Love. In the summer of 1995, Francine debuted in ECW at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams as a devoted fan of Stevie Richards and later became his manager and on-screen girlfriend. The new partnership angered both Richards's tag team partner Raven and Raven's valet Beulah McGillicutty. This rivalry led to several catfights between the women including a match in which Richards turned on Francine due to the influence of Raven and Beulah winning the match. Francine (right) with Chris Candido in Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1998. Francine then allied herself with The Pitbulls tag team, who had left Raven's Nest, adopting a leather-clad dominatrix persona to fit with the Pitbulls' gimmick. She led The Pitbulls to a victory over Richards and Raven for the ECW Tag Team Championships on September 16, 1995. At Cyberslam '96 Francine and the Pitbulls defeated The Eliminators and Richards in a Dog Collar match when Francine pinned Richards after he was superbombed by The Pitbulls. She also led Pitbull #2 to win the ECW Television Championship from Shane Douglas, who had insulted her earlier in the program. On July 13, 1996 at ECW Heat Wave, Francine turned on The Pitbulls and became the manager of Shane Douglas. The Pitbulls gained their revenge by superbombing her through a table. Francine managed Douglas from 1996 until his departure from the promotion in 1999. Referred to as his \\"Head\\" Cheerleader, she twice helped him become ECW World Heavyweight Champion. During this time, she could also occasionally be found at ringside in support of Douglas' Triple Threat teammates Chris Candido and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow, however, legitimately broke her pelvic bone while performing a press slam on her. In November 1997, she was by Douglas' side when he defeated Bigelow for the World Championship. She remained Douglas's manager until he left ECW in 1999. In 1999, Francine began managing Tommy Dreamer. In mid-1999, Francine feuded with Steve Corino, who she defeated in multiple singles matches. Her partnership with Dreamer lasted until March 2000, when she left Dreamer after he accidentally DDT'd her while temporarily blinded, aligning herself with Raven. On April 22, 2000 at CyberSlam, Dreamer defeated Taz to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Following the match, Francine and Raven came to ringside to congratulate him. As Dreamer celebrated with Raven, Justin Credible and Jason attacked them, resulting in an impromptu championship bout between Dreamer and Credible.

It is largely set at Palisades Charter High School and the surrounding area, including Downtown Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades, Malibu (where Dunst's character lives), and East Los Angeles (where Hernandez's character lives). Plot Nicole Oakley, the out-of-control daughter of congressman Tom Oakley, meets a working class Mexican-American straight-A student, Carlos Nu√±ez. Nicole is troubled because her mother committed suicide when she was very young, feeling unwanted by her father, who has another young daughter with his new wife. Carlos, on the other hand, is from a poor background and is working hard towards becoming a Navy pilot. They fall in love, and Carlos spends so much time with her that he stops performing well in school. Carlos is applying to the U.S. Naval Academy and Nicole's father suggests Carlos talk to him about gaining his Congressional sponsorship to the Academy. During their meeting, Nicole's father tells Carlos that he needs to end his relationship with Nicole, or she will destroy his life. Carlos breaks up with her, which leads Nicole into depression and back into wild, drunken partying. One night, Carlos calls her and finds out she is getting drunk at a high school party. He saves Nicole from a boy trying to take advantage of her. Carlos drives her home, but they get stopped by the police. As a result of this incident, Nicole's father and step-mother decide that she needs to go to a boarding school far away from home; Carlos rescues her and they run away together. While they are away, Nicole realizes she is getting in the way of Carlos's dreams, so she decides it is time to stop running away from her problems, feeling she wants to be better for Carlos and have a future with him. They go back home and she makes up with her father. Her father thanks Carlos for not listening to his advice to abandon Nicole. In the end credits, we see that Carlos has become a pilot with the Navy.

Dunst, who was 18 at the time, accepted the role because she was tired of playing \\"sweet\\" girls in previous films. The actress also helped Stockwell convince Disney executives not to tone down the film's language and adult themes. Although a nude scene was in the script, it was never filmed because Dunst was 17 years old when she got cast and her mother flatly refused to let her do this scene. Crazy/Beautiful was planned as an R-rated film, but Disney ultimately wanted a more commercial PG-13 rating and ordered Stockwell to cut 35 obscenities, including a sex scene and a character's drug use. The film was originally titled \\"At Seventeen\\". Reception Crazy/Beautiful opened at #9 at the U.S. Box office taking in $4,715,060 USD during its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $19,937,988 on a $13 million budget. Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie a score of 63% from 99 reviews. The critical consensus read, \\"The story is not new, but the film gets credit for trying to move away from the genre's cliches. Kirsten Dunst and newcomer Jay Hernandez give believable performances\\". Metacritic gave the film a score 61 based on 26 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The New York Times critic A. O. Scott praised the lead actors and the film's lively soundtrack, but criticized the other characters for being flat and superficial. He concluded that Crazy/Beautiful is \\"an enormous improvement over the brainless, patronizing teenage romances\\" of the time, but also admitted that it could have been much better if the filmmakers \\"had trusted themselves and the actors a bit more\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack album was released by Hollywood Records on June 6, 2001; Seven Mary Three's \\"Wait\\" served as the album's English lead single; La Ley's \\"Siempre (Every Time)\\" was its Spanish lead single. \\"Wait\\" charted considerably well and its music video, directed by the film's director Stockwell, featured Dunst and Hernandez.Hollywood Records to Release Bilingual/Bi-Cultural \\"Crazy/Beautiful\\" Soundtrack Hispanic Times Magazine (September 22, 2001).

This film was loosely inspired by writer/director Brad Silberling's own experience. He was dating actress Rebecca Schaeffer at the time she was killed by an obsessed fan in 1989. The film takes its name from the Rolling Stones song of the same name. The film's original title was Baby's in Black, and then later changed to Goodbye Hello, and then the current title. The film is set in 1973 and music from that era is heavily featured, including that of the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, and Elton John. Plot Following the murder of Diana Floss in a restaurant in Cape Ann, Massachusetts in 1973, her fianc√© Joe Nast elects to stay with her parents. Her father, Ben, is a realtor whose business partner has recently left. Ben and Joe go into business as Floss & Son, as this was their plan before Diana's death. Joe goes to the post office to retrieve all the invitations that had been sent out for his and Diana's wedding, and with the help of Bertie Knox he retrieves seventy-four of seventy-five. She finds the last invitation and takes it to his house later that night. He drops her off at a local bar, and returns home, despite her inviting him in for a drink. Joe and Ben attend a local property fair, and Ben pitches the idea of redeveloping a block in the town to developer Mike Mulcahey. Mulcahey agrees, but they need to get all the tenants to agree. Diana's friends come around to look through her possessions, much to the consternation of her mother, Jojo. They then take Joe out for a drink at the same bar Bertie went to the previous night. Joe puts \\"Moonlight Mile\\" on the jukebox and Bertie dances with him. Joe convinces Ben to let him talk to the bar's owner to convince them to sell. Feeling trapped at the Floss home, he meets Bertie and tells her about Diana. He confesses to her that he had split up with Diana three days before she was killed. Bertie tells Joe about her boyfriend, the owner of the bar, who is lost in Vietnam. One night Joe sneaks out the window to go see Bertie again. They sleep together, and he leaves the next morning, slipping back into Diana's house through the window. Jojo is sitting in the room, drinking, knowing that he was out seeing another woman, and saddened by the idea that she had always known he would have never ended up with her daughter. She does not want Joe to leave, as they have formed a bond. Joe goes to dinner at the Mulcahey's, where Mike's wife presumes aloud that Joe was not still tied up with thoughts of his fiancee's murder. Joe states that this is not the case, upsetting the mood at the dinner table. Mike calls Ben and ends their deal. Bertie confronts Joe about what happened between them, and they have an argument in which he tells her no one believes her boyfriend is coming home and that she deserved better anyway. She leaves, upset. The family attends the trial of Diana's murderer. However, the murderer's wife elicits sympathy from the jury, and the prosecutor, Mona Camp, asks Joe to testify and help the jury gain sympathy for Diana. While on the witness stand, Joe confesses that he and Diana had broken up prior to her death, and had not told her parents. Ben and Jojo are happy with the confession and gain closure. Joe symbolically writes 75 letters expressing his newfound clarity about what course his life ought to take and his love for Bertie, and places them in mailboxes around town, hoping that one will get to her. Ben closes the shop, Jojo resumes her writing career, Bertie sells the bar, and she and Joe leave town.

It is made by putting cheese and sliced ham between two slices of bread., p. 138: \\"Insert slices of ham and cheese between 2 slices of buttered bread or toast. Add lettuce along with mayonnaise and/or mustard.\\" The bread is sometimes buttered and/or toasted. Vegetables like lettuce, tomato, onion or pickle slices can also be included. Various kinds of mustard and mayonnaise are also common. Sliced bread, sliced cheese, and sliced cooked ham are very readily available in Western supermarkets and as a result ham and cheese sandwiches are quick and easy to prepare. They are a common component of a packed lunch. History Home made ham and cheese sandwich As recalled by ballpark concessionaire Harry Stevens in a 1924 interview, in 1894 ham and cheese sandwiches were the only food sold in New York baseball parks; frankfurters were introduced in 1909.The New York Times, April 13, 1924, p. XX2: Ball Fans Must Eat: Harry Stevens, Caterer to the Sport World, Talks of Outdoor Appetites An Englishwoman, writing in 1923 of her passage through Ellis Island on a trip to the U.S., noted: :I was in fear and trembling, having heard so many tales of the abuse aliens receive there.... The attendants were very kind and not at all rough with us. It was the noon hour... in a little while porters came along with baskets of very good ham and cheese sandwiches and coffee for the grown-ups and milk for the babies.The New York Times, July 1, 1923, p. XX8, Letters to the Editor: Experience at Ellis Island Richard E. Byrd took ham and cheese sandwiches on his 1926 polar flight as did 1927 transatlantic fliers Chamberlin and Levine.The New York Times, June 29, 1927, p. 2, Fliers' Menus More Varied Than That on Earlier Trips. In addition to sixteen ham and cheese sandwiches, Byrd took sixteen chicken sandwiches, four roast chickens, one gallon of coffee, and one quart of tea. (Lindbergh carried ham sandwiches).  Origins  The origin of the ham and cheese sandwich has been debated for a number of years by culinary intellectuals. The leading theory as to who first started to produce a ham, cheese and bread dish is mentioned in The Larousse Gastronomique 1961. Here it notes that Patrick Connolly, an 18th-century Irish immigrant to England, sold a bread dish which: \\"combined the remains of pig, cured and sliced with a topping of Leicester cheese and a kiss of egg yolk sauce (a form of mayonnaise) in a round bread roll. The dish was rather unimaginatively known as a Connolly and is still sometimes referred to as this in some parts of the Midlands in the UK.\\" In the UK, a common addition to a ham and cheese sandwich is pickle (a sweet, vinegary chutney originally by Branston); the snack is then known as a ham, cheese and pickle sandwich.  Types  In French cuisine, a croque-monsieur is a type of ham and cheese sandwich. It is baked or fried. In Brazilian cuisine, this sandwich roasted is known as misto-quente (\\"hot mix\\" in literal translation). The Cuban sandwich is made with ham, cheese, and crusty Cuban bread, often toasted in a panini press. Variations of this sandwich are popular in both Cuba and South Florida.

Founded with heavy backing with the Union Pacific Railroad, it was controlled by the Union Pacific from its inception, but was incorporated into the new Colorado and Southern Railway in 1898, becoming part of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1908. History The railroad company was organized by investors in northern Colorado on January 17, 1881 with the intention of starting a southern branch of the transcontinental railroad that would pass through northern Colorado, connecting westward from the former Denver Pacific Railroad line at Greeley, as well as a narrow gauge line west of Boulder to the gold mining area above that city. The railroad received financial backing from the Union Pacific, which was concerned about plans by its rival, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, to extend its line westward from the South Platte River valley over the Rocky Mountains to Salt Lake City. The GSLPRR constructed a line between Greeley and Fort Collins, as well as several spurs, one which went up into the foothills to the stone quarries at Stout at the present site of Horsetooth Reservoir. The GSLPRR was the second railroad to arrive in Fort Collins, coming five years after the arrival of the Colorado Central Railroad. The line skirted the Cache la Poudre River in Fort Collins, along the current Willow Street. Eminent domain was used by the (then) Town of Fort Collns to obtain property for the line. The line is still part of the Union Pacific system. The narrow gauge line penetrated the foothills west of Boulder by following Boulder Canyon to Four Mile Canyon to the town of Sunset. a line was surveyed further westward, but no track was ever laid by this company. The GSLPRR owned no narrow gauge equipment, and the line was actually operated by the Colorado Central Railroad using their own narrow gauge equipment and later by the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway. The line was badly damaged by flooding in the spring of 1894, and was subsequently abandoned. The Colorado and Northwestern Railway was built along this same route, starting in 1897. The towns of Timnath and Windsor were both founded in the early 1880s along the line between Greeley and Fort Collins. Although the Union Pacific sponsored surveying expeditions up the Poudre Canyon, with the intention of possibly extending the line over Cameron Pass into North Park, the parent railroad lost interest in the project after the abandonment of the similar plans by its rival, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 4,754. The village is about north of Wallingford at the foot of the Chiltern Hills at the confluence of a chalk stream (Ewelme Brook) and the River Thames, next to Benson Lock. Geography Being on the northern (eastern) bank of the Thames, Benson was unaffected by the 1974 boundary changes between Berkshire and Oxfordshire The village is on river silts and gravel, just above the surrounding marshy land that gives nearby settlements of Preston Crowmarsh, Crowmarsh Gifford, and Rokemarsh their names. The fertile land which surrounds the village meant that farming was the main source of employment until the 20th century. The brook that runs through the village is home to trout and to the invasive American signal crayfish. Toponym The toponym was originally Villam Regiam, \\"the King's Town\\". Later it was Bensington, from the Old English B√¶nesingtun meaning \\"farmstead of the people of [a man called] Benesa\\". The village is reputedly the site of the Battle of Bensington. The present name, Benson, can be found early in the 19th century, but Bensington continued in use, at least for formal documents, until well into the second half of the century. The 1866 Working Agreement, made by the GWR for operating the Wallingford and Watlington Railway, used the older form. Archaeology There is evidence of human presence dating back to the Palaeolithic period ‚Äì around 10,000 BC. The village occupies the site of an ancient British town and there is known to have been occupation during the Roman period, although Benson's written history dates back only as far as AD 571.p. 5. Retrieved 9 June 2020. Recent excavations at the site of a new housing site at the junction of St Helen's Avenue and Church Road revealed evidence of early Neolithic (3500 BC) and later Bronze Age or early Iron Age (11th‚Äì8th centuries BC) pits and post holes, as well as a possible later Bronze Age roundhouse and three early or middle Saxon (5th‚Äì6th centuries AD) sunken-floored buildings. Manor The village was taken by the West Saxons in AD 573, who established a royal vill. In 775 the West Saxons surrendered it to Offa of Mercia, who wanted a stronghold on the eastern bank of the Thames. At the time of the Domesday Book of 1086 Benson was \\"the richest royal manor in Oxfordshire\\". The boundaries of the manor extended from the borders of Stadhampton in the north to include Henley in the south-east and were probably established long before the Conquest. The manor is stated to be worth ¬£85 a year although comprising only 11.75 hides, whereas the Bishop of Lincoln's 90 hides at Dorchester were valued at only ¬£30. Benson itself was clearly the most valuable part of the manor. The map shows that Benson parish is only about one tenth of the area of Benson manor, but the Domesday Book values the parish alone at ¬£30, compared with ¬£5 for the neighbouring parish of Berrick. Parish church Polish and Czechoslovak airmen in the extension of St Helen's parish churchyard The Church of England parish church of St Helen is partly ancient. John Marius Wilson described it as \\"variously late pointed Norman and decorated; has a modern tower; contains a Norman font and two [monumental] brasses; and is very good.\\" The parish includes the hamlets of Fifield and Crowmarsh-Battle or Preston-Crowmarsh. The village is often confused with RAF Benson, which is a well-known RAF station and airfield. The RAF airfield boundary is immediately adjacent to the village, and the aerodrome's construction closed the former \\"London Road\\". The RAF buildings are on the opposite side of the airfield to Benson village, adjacent to the village of Ewelme. The church tower was rebuilt in 1794. It has a single clock face on the east-facing side with hours displayed in Roman numerals. The clock face erroneously has the nine o'clock marker painted as \\"XI\\". The eleven o'clock marker is also XI. This mistake gained fame during the Second World War when Germany's English-speaking propaganda broadcaster, William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw) promised an air raid on \\"an airfield near the village whose clock had two elevens\\". RAF Benson was bombed soon afterwards. The bell tower has a ring of eight bells. Six of them, including the tenor and treble, were cast in 1781 by Thomas Janaway of Chelsea The current second and third bells were added by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry: the second was cast by Charles and George Mears in 1852 and the third by Mears and Stainbank in 1922. In October 2009 White's of Appleton removed the original oak bell frame of 1794 and replaced it with a modern steel frame. White's refurbished the bells and fitted them with new headstocks for installation in the new steel frame.Benson. Retrieved 9 June 2020.

A flash lock was installed on the Thames at Benson in 1746. Benson weir collapsed in 1783, necessitating the construction of Benson pound lock in 1788. The lock was rebuilt in 1870. The road between Henley-on-Thames and Dorchester on Thames was made into a turnpike in 1736 and in the 18th and early 19th centuries Benson became an important staging post for coaches running between London and Oxford via Henley. Its broad open square was surrounded by coaching inns. At its peak the village had four large inns, ten smaller alehouses and a blacksmith. The opening, in 1844, of the Oxford branch of the GWR resulted in a rapid decline in coach traffic, so that within ten years only three Oxford- London coaches per week were running through Benson. The Henley ‚Äì Dorchester road ceased to be a turnpike in 1873. The decline in coaching, the enclosures, and the agricultural depression led to a fall in population from 1253 in 1841 to 1157 by 1861.Table of population. Retrieved 9 June 2020. Benson war memorial The failure to extend the Wallingford and Watlington Railway to Watlington, which would have included a station at Benson (on an embankment north of Littleworth Road and close to the junction with Oxford Road), left the village increasingly isolated, as passenger transport between London and Oxford largely followed a railway line that ran nowhere near the once- prominent coaching stop. The village recovered as motor coaches and increasingly private cars became more important. In response Benson gained a number of roadhouse-type cafes ‚Äì the early 20th-century equivalents of coaching inns. Amenities Row of shops in the High Street Despite its lack of a railway station and distance from the M4 and M40, Benson today is a commuter village. It has a Church of England primary school on Oxford Road. A separate infants school was built at the top of Westfield Road in 1972 \\"to relieve congestion at the Oxford Road school\\", but early in the new millennium, the infants department returned to Oxford Road, allowing the Westfield Road site to be sold off for a housing development known as Millar Close.Benson C of E Primary School There is also a pre-school. There is also a GP's practice, and two public houses: the 18th-century coaching inn, The Crown Inn,Crown Inn Benson and the Three Horseshoes. (The number is down from five since 1990, the closed ones having become private homes.) There are about a dozen small shops, including a supermarket and a dispensing chemist. A large garage on the main Oxford road just outside the village has an on-site McDonald's (with drive-through) and a Marks and Spencer food outlet, but the Vauxhall main car dealership there has now closed. Aircraft noise in the area can be significant, which lowers property values compared with many of the surrounding villages.Noise assessment. Retrieved 9 June 2020. The village is also a well-known frost-pocket, sometimes recording the lowest night-time temperatures in the UK. This minor climatic quirk may have led to the village's part in the development of modern meteorology, with an important meteorological observatory being located in the village in the early 19th century.Retrieved 9 June 2020.

Fresco of St Gregory the Illuminator wearing a gold epigonation (the half-visible rhombus behind the Omophorion) embroidered with an icon (14th century, Mistra). The epigonation (Greek: , literally meaning \\"over the knee\\"), or palitza (Russian: , \\"club\\"), is a vestment used in some Eastern Christian churches. Description and usage In Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite the palitza is worn by all bishops, and as an ecclesiastical award for some priests. Its origin is traced to the practice of Byzantine Emperors awarding ceremonial swords to their military commanders in recognition of their valour in defending the empire. Such swords were often accompanied by elaborate thigh-shields which were suspended from the belt and protected the leg from bruising caused by the constant bumping of the sword against the thigh. When the emperors began to give awards to the clergy, the thigh-shield alone was awarded. The vestment is a stiff, lozenge shaped cloth that hangs on the right side of the body below the waist, suspended by one corner from a strap drawn over the left shoulder. In the Russian tradition it is an award for service; in the Greek tradition it is usually a sign that the priest has an advanced academic degree and a blessing to hear confessions. If a Russian priest has been awarded both the nabedrennik and the palitza, he shifts the former to the left side. It is considered to symbolise the \\"sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God\\" (); that is to say, the wearer's defending of the faith by smiting all that is impure and vicious. Upon donning his palitza, the cleric prays: \\"Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Mighty One, in thy comeliness and thy beauty; and exert, and fare Thee well, and reign in the name of truth, and of meekness, and of justice; and Thy right hand shall guide Thee wondrously. Now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen\\". History The epigonation's origin is uncertain. According to some authorities it was a decorated tablion or thigh- shield awarded to officials in the Byzantine Empire, originally military and later civilian. According to others it was originally an ornamental handkerchief, called at that date encheirion, \\"hand cloth\\", which received its present form and name in the twelfth century. In the former case it has no Western Christian counterpart; in the latter it would correspond to the Sub- cinctorium, used by Roman popes in solemn masses. It is also said that it was used to carry documents relating to one's position in the Church. Papers such as those certifying one's ordination and rank would be most relevant when travelling. Carrying them in the Liturgy would be symbolic of bearing one's authority to conduct the Holy things of the Liturgy. During the Mystery (Sacrament) of Ordination, a priest or deacon is taken in procession three times around the Holy Table (altar), after each circuit he bows down before the bishop and kisses his epigonation and his right hand. Also, in some liturgical traditions, when a bishop performs a lesser ordination, such as the setting-apart of a subdeacon, he lays his epigonation over the candidate's head as he says the prayer. Armenian usage The gonker (epigonation) is used exclusively by the two Catholicoi of the Armenian Apostolic Church and is granted occasionally with special authorization to patriarchs. The Catholicos of the Armenian Catholic Church also wears it, although it does not appear to be exclusive to him. The recently ordained archbishop for the Armenian Catholic Archeparchy of Constantinople wore a gonker at his ordination.http://armenianchurchco.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/09/zekiyan2takdis.jpg An image of Saint Blaise of Sebaste in the Armenian Catholic parish of San Nicola da Tolentino in Rome depicts the saint wearing a gonker.http://mechitar.com/pic/big/01_02_38.jpg ReferencesSources * * Category:Eastern Christian vestments Category:History of clothing Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) Category:History of fashion Category:Byzantine clothing ","title":"Epigonation"},{"id":"1883036","text":"Sidney Robert \\"Bob\\" Blair, (13 August 1929 - 18 April 2009) was a Canadian engineer and businessman.

Langford's Basic Photography, p. 354 Colloquially, an image is burned when it contains uniform blobs of color, black, or white where there should actually be detail. A sample photograph The same image burned by increasing the contrast The original burned by increasing its saturation The original image in black and white The black-and-white image burned for artistic purposes All media for storing or capturing images, both analog and digital, are capable of storing only a limited number of color hues, and are bound to a certain gamut. Squeezing an image with a given gamut into a medium with a smaller gamut is done either by adapting the whole range of colors to the new gamut, or by trimming the colors out of gamut. Trimming colors at the extremes results in burning the image. While converting and capturing images is usually a \\"smart\\" process which tries to accommodate the entire gamut of the original into the target color space, extreme processing of an image usually results in burning, as defined above. The most obvious case of burning is when an image's contrast is raised too much, and the result contains obvious black or white blobs, where there used to be detail in the shadows or the highlights. In this case, the brightness can be adjusted in parallel, and in this way the artist decides whether to preserve detail in the shadows (increase brightness) or in the highlights (decrease brightness), at the expense of detail in the opposite. A more subtle case of burning occurs when an image's saturation is increased too much. In this case, whichever color reaches its limits starts burning, and the resulting image contains blobs of that color where there used to be detail. In this case, avoiding the burn is much more difficult if the saturation needs to be increased to the respective level, because all other colors need to be adjusted proportionally, or discoloration will occur. While burned images in color are typically not pleasing and need to be avoided, black-and-white photographs can sometimes be enhanced artistically by burning them; the decision to burn, along with the degree of burning, is a subjective matter. Typically, as a rule of thumb, shadows are more \\"forgiving\\" with burning than highlights.

Andrew Whittaker, Dublin, A&A; Farmar, 2006]. Gageby was born in Dublin, at 54 Upper Beechwood Avenue, Ranelagh, to Thomas Gageby, a Belfast-born civil servant. His mother, Ethel Elizabeth n√©e Smith, was a schoolteacher from county of Cavan. The Gageby family moved to Belfast when Douglas was about three as his father went to work for the Northern Ireland Civil Service following partition. His paternal grandfather Robert Gageby had stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate in Belfast North in 1910,Obituary Douglas Gageby The Guardian, 29 Jun 2004. and was a Belfast City Councillor for 20 years, first elected in 1898 as a trade union candidate supported by the Independent Labour Party. He was educated at Belfast Royal Academy and Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a scholar in Modern Languages (French and German) in 1940. He was also actively involved with the student newspaper Trinity News. He enlisted in the Irish Army as a private soldier at the outbreak of World War II. He was commissioned later, and he served as an intelligence officer. He reported from post-war Germany for The Irish Press and went on to work under Conor Cruise O'Brien in the Irish News Agency. In 1954 he was the first editor of the Evening Press.O'Brien, Mark. De Valera, Fianna F√°il and the Irish Press:The Truth in the News?. Irish Academic Press, 2001 (p.94) In 1963 he became editor of The Irish Times, a post he held until 1986, having been brought back from a short retirement in 1974.Horgan, John Irish Media: a critical history since 1922. Routledge, 2001 (p.92). He is credited with moving the Irish Times from a Unionist organ into a successful Irish journal of record. 'White Nigger' controversy In 2003 it was revealed that a director (and later Chairman) of The Irish Times, Major T. B. McDowell, had referred to Gageby as a 'white nigger' for his views and role in the paper during the Civil Rights Movements (CRM) campaign in the 1960s. Irish Times' Major McDowell called his editor a 'white nigger' - Irish Times 26 January 2003 The comment appeared in a letter from the British Ambassador to Dublin, Sir Andrew Gilchrist, to Kelvin White, head of the Irish Section of the British Foreign Office and is dated 2 October 1969. Gilchrist was referring to conversations which he had with McDowell where the latter professed himself to be fully behind the British government in the North and hostile to Gageby's coverage of the CRM.O'Brien, Mark. The Irish Times: A History Four Courts Press, 2008, (pgs. 186-190, 268-9). However, historian Mark O'Brien notes \\"Despite his contacts with London, McDowell's actions did not interfere with Gageby's editorials on Northern Ireland\\", due to the fact McDowell believed in editorial independence (even though McDowell strongly disagreed with Gageby's nationalist views), and because Gageby was making the newspaper commercially successful. Under the 30 year rule, this letter was made available to newspapers on 22 and 23 December 1999, but no newspaper published it at that time. The communiqu√© was later discovered by the historian, Jack Lane, and published in the Irish Political Review, a small magazine strongly antagonistic to The Irish Times, in January 2003. He brought it to the attention of The Irish Times editor, Geraldine Kennedy, on 10 January 2003 and she replied on 15 January 2003 saying she was \\"unable to confirm the veracity of it\\" and did not publish it. When, on 26 January 2003, the Sunday Independent (Ireland) published the story, The Irish Times finally followed the next day, 27 January.

He was the father of wrestlers Barry and Kendall Windham, father-in-law of Mike Rotunda, and the maternal grandfather of Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas. American football career As a young man, Windham played football at Texas Western College, now known as the University of Texas at El Paso. Windham served a tour of duty in the United States Marine Corps. He then went on to play for the New York Jets during the 1966 pre-season and received tryouts with the New Orleans Saints and Denver Broncos. Professional wrestling career After football, at the urging of Wahoo McDaniel, Windham trained with Joe Blanchard in Corpus Christi, Texas and later with Verne Gagne and became a professional wrestler in the American Wrestling Association. Billed as being 6' 9\\" and over 300 pounds, Windham was a rawboned cowboy in the vein of Bobby Duncum or Stan Hansen. His training complete, he prepared to move on to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and was transformed into Blackjack Mulligan. Mulligan donned black trunks, black hat, a black fingerless glove, and used the iron claw submission hold. When he arrived in the WWWF, he was managed by The Grand Wizard. Early stills of the two actually identify him as Big Bob Windham. Mulligan went on to great success in the Northeast and was an early challenger to newly crowned champion Pedro Morales. His push was interrupted when he was slashed in the thigh by a fan at the Boston Garden and required hundreds of stitches to close the wound. The culprit was actually captured by Gorilla Monsoon, who threw him at the ringside police ‚Äì who promptly let him go because they thought \\"it was part of the show\\". Before he left to recover from his wound, Mulligan participated in a Madison Square Garden match against Bruno Sammartino, who was making his first appearance at the arena since the end of his nearly eight-year championship reign. Mulligan attacked Sammartino before the bell. Sammartino quickly recovered, slammed Mulligan twice and pinned him in 64 seconds. In wrestling terms, everybody \\"got over\\" - the building was sold out to the delight of promoter Vince McMahon the elder, Sammartino made a strong return to New York and Mulligan, who was in no condition to work an actual match, received a large pay-off to aid his recovery. Once he healed, Mulligan returned to the Midwest and tagged with Blackjack Lanza to form The Blackjacks. Although Mulligan was the much bigger star, the duo went on to capture numerous tag team championships in various NWA affiliated promotions as well as the WWWF World Tag Team Championship in August 1975. Blackjack returned to singles wrestling in the Jim Crockett Promotions where he would go on to hold the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship and the Mid- Atlantic's version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Ric Flair. Mulligan often battled Andr√© the Giant, feuding in many different regions in the early 1980s. When they brought their feud to the WWF (formerly the WWWF) in 1982, Windham was noted as saying Andre had no limit to his strength. Mulligan then wrestled in Florida. He often teamed with West Texas stars Dusty Rhodes, Dick Murdoch, and his son Barry Windham. Mulligan returned to the WWF as a full-time performer in 1984, hosting an interview segment titled Blackjack's Barbecue on WWF All-Star Wrestling, the counterpart to Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit. In 1986, Mulligan wrestled under a mask as \\"Big Machine\\", part of a team with \\"The Giant Machine\\" (Andr√© the Giant) and \\"Super Machine\\" (Bill Eadie) collectively known as The Machines. They won several high-profile matches against the Heenan family, later recruiting members such as 'Hulk Machine' and 'Piper Machine'. After that angle ended, Mulligan wrestled for the WWF as himself, until he finally left in 1987. Later on, Jack traveled to Dallas and competed in World Class Championship Wrestling, wrestling against Bruiser Brody, Chris Adams and Kevin and Lance Von Erich. Mulligan also returned to Florida in 1987 to fight against the Funk brothers, teaming with Kevin Sullivan. Mulligan worked as a match booker and promoter all around the South, eventually co-owning the Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion with Dick Murdoch after purchasing it from Dory and Terry Funk.

Personal life In 1990, Blackjack Mulligan and his son Kendall Windham were arrested by the US Secret Service in a joint investigation with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) for counterfeiting. The authorities found close to $500,000 in phony $20 bills. As a result of a plea agreement, both father and son spent 24 months in a federal prison and were released in 1992. In 2007, Windham published his book titled True Lies and Alibis, which tells about his personal life and his professional wrestling career. In 2012, Windham, a born again Christian, was ordained a minister by Divine Hearts Ministry located in Lake Saint Louis, Missouri. He was very devoted to spending the time he had remaining to spreading the word of God. He felt his ordination could help him in this endeavor. In July 2015, Windham was named as a defendant in a 2015 lawsuit filed by WWE after they received a letter from him indicating that he intended to sue them for concussion-based injuries sustained during his tenure with them. He was represented by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who is involved in several other lawsuits involving former WWE wrestlers. Over two years after his death, US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018. Death After dealing with health issues in recent years and being hospitalized with a heart attack several months earlier, Windham was hospitalized in Florida in October 2015. He died on April 7, 2016. He was buried at the Florida National Cemetery.

Exclusive rights under VARA VARA exclusively grants authors of works that fall under the protection of the Act the following rights *right to claim authorship *right to prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create *right to prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation *right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation Additionally, authors of works of \\"recognized stature\\" may prohibit intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work. Exceptions to VARA require a waiver from the author in writing. To date, \\"recognized stature\\" has managed to elude a precise definition. VARA allows authors to waive their rights, something generally not permitted in France and many European countries whose laws were the originators of the moral rights of artists concept.Robert J. Sherman. Note: THE VISUAL ARTISTS RIGHTS ACT OF 1990: AMERICAN ARTISTS BURNED AGAIN. 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 373 (1995) In most instances, the rights granted under VARA persist for the life of the author (or the last surviving author, for creators of joint works). Covered works VARA provides its protection only to paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, still photographic images produced for exhibition only, and existing in single copies or in limited editions of 200 or fewer copies, signed and numbered by the artist. The requirements for protection do not implicate aesthetic taste or value. Application and effect VARA's application is limited to visual works that fall within a narrowly defined category. However, for works that do fall within the category of protected works, VARA imposes substantial restrictions on any modification or removal of those works. Purchasers of the works must obtain written waivers from the author if they wish to exercise any of the exclusive rights under VARA. This has particularly been an issue for those that commission public sculptures. Absent a waiver, artists could effectively veto decisions to remove their structures from their benefactor's land. In a 2006 decision involving public sculptures that were removed from the park for which they were created, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that VARA does not protect location as a component of site-specific work. VARA covered works can be moved as long as the move does not constitute \\"destruction, distortion, or mutilation.\\"See Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc., 459 F.3d 128 (1st Circuit 2006). However, one artist has claimed \\"The moment that the sculpture is removed, it will be destroyed, because it cannot be what it is anywhere else.\\"Palo Alto Wants to Tear Down a Giant Computer-Egg Sculpture‚ÄîBut the Artist Says It Violates Her Rights, February 5, 2018, https://news.artnet.com/art-world/palo-alto-public-art-vara-1215491 Examples of works *Tilted Arc, a well-known artwork by Richard Serra, was removed from public display prior to the enactment of VARA. *Kent Twitchell's Ed Ruscha mural was painted over without his approval.

The starter ring gear is usually made from medium carbon steel. Starter ring gears are attached to either the flywheel or the flexplate of an engine. The teeth of the ring gear are driven by the smaller gear (known as the pinion) of the starter motor. The pinion engages the starter ring only during starting and once the engine is running the pinion withdraws. Manufacture The starter ring gear is most commonly made by forming a length of square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. This ring is then machined to create flat surfaces of the required inner and outer diameters. The gear teeth are then created using a hobbing tool, followed by processes to chamfer, deburr and clean the gear teeth. Induction hardening is used to increase the surface hardness of the teeth for abrasion resistance and also increase the core strength of the tooth to resist the bending forces applied to the tooth during starting. This heat-treatment is usually followed by tempering to reduce internal stresses and increase the toughness of the teeth. The hardness at pitch circle diameter is typically in the range 45-55 HRc. Attachment Starter ring gear attached to a flywheel In cars with a manual transmission, the starter ring gear is fitted to the outer diameter of the flywheel. The ring gear is usually fixed to the flywheel through use of an interference fit, which is achieved by heating the ring gear and so that thermal expansion allows it to be placed around the flywheel. In cars with an automatic transmission, the starter ring gear is usually welded to the outside of the flexplate.

It ended in a decisive crusader defeat and led to the disintegration of the crusade. The two main Christian forces that marched to the Holy Land in response to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Both faced disastrous marches across Anatolia in the months that followed, with most of their armies being destroyed. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa (Urfa), but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus. At the Council of Acre, magnates from France, Germany, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem decided to divert the crusade to Damascus. The crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where orchards of Ghouta would provide them with a constant food supply. Having arrived outside the walls of the city, they immediately put it to siege, using wood from the orchards. On 27 July, the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water. Afterwards, the local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. The entire crusader army retreated back to Jerusalem by 28 July. Background The first hostile act between the Crusaders and the Burid rulers of Damascus was in form of raids in 1125, followed by the Battle of Marj al-Saffar in 1126, when the Crusaders defeated the Muslim army in the field but failed in their objective to capture Damascus. In 1129, they attacked Damascus again, when they camped near the Wooden Bridge (Jisr al- Khashab) at DƒÅrayyƒÅ southwest of the city, but their siege of the city was unsuccessful, after their foraging expedition south into the Hauran was defeated, in addition to inability to advance due to a sudden thunderstorm and the ensuing fog, meanwhile, according to Michael the Syrian, who may be relying on the lost contemporary chronicle of Basil bar Shumna, Damascus paid 20,000 dinars and offered annual tribute in return for the crusaders' withdrawal. However, the crusaders managed to take Banias instead. In 1147, Baldwin III marched with his army to capture Bosra, south of Damascus, after an invitation from Altuntash, the emir of Bosra and Salkhad who squabbled with his nominal superior, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, ruler of Damascus. When they arrived at Bosra, the Crusaders' high hopes were dashed to capture it when they found that Altuntash's wife, made of sterner stuff than her husband, had introduced a Damascene garrison into Bosra's citadel. Unwilling to chance a siege close to an enemy host, Baldwin elected to withdraw. Second Crusade Crusaders intended for Edessa, seen here on the right of this map (c.1140), were diverted by King Baldwin III of Jerusalem to Damascus. The two main Christian forces that marched to the Holy Land in response to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Conrad's force included Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly and Vladislaus II of Bohemia, as well as Frederick of Swabia, his nephew who would become Emperor Frederick I. The crusade had been called after the fall of the County of Edessa on 24 December 1144. The crusaders marched across Europe and arrived at Constantinople in September and October 1147. Both faced disastrous marches across Anatolia in the months that followed, and most of their armies were destroyed. Louis abandoned his troops and travelled by ship to the Principality of Antioch, where his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine's uncle, Raymond, was prince. Raymond expected him to offer military assistance against the Seljuk Turks threatening the principality, but Louis refused and went to Jerusalem to fulfil his crusader vow. Conrad, stricken by illness, had earlier returned to Constantinople, but arrived in Jerusalem a few weeks later in early April 1148. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus. Stephen, King of England did not participate in the second crusade due to internal conflicts. Council of Acre Near East during the Second Crusade The Council of Acre was called with the Haute Cour of Jerusalem at Acre on 24 June. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Cour in its existence: Conrad, Otto of Freising, Henry II, Duke of Austria, Welf VI, future emperor Frederick, and William V, Marquess of Montferrat represented the Holy Roman Empire. Louis, Thierry of Alsace, and various other ecclesiastical and secular lords represented the French. From Jerusalem King Baldwin, Queen Melisende, Patriarch Fulk, Robert de Craon (master of the Knights Templar), Raymond du Puy de Provence (master of the Knights Hospitaller), Manasses of Hierges (constable of Jerusalem), Humphrey II of Toron, Philip of Milly, Walter I Grenier, and Barisan of Ibelin were among those present. Notably, no one from Antioch, Tripoli, or the former County of Edessa attended. Both Louis and Conrad were persuaded to attack Damascus. Some of the barons native to Jerusalem pointed out that it would be unwise to attack Damascus, as the Burid dynasty, though Muslim, were their allies against the Zengid dynasty. Imad ad-Din Zengi had besieged the city in 1140, and Mu'in ad-Din Unur, a Mamluk acting as vizier for the young Mujir ad-Din Abaq, negotiated an alliance with Jerusalem through the chronicler Usama ibn Munqidh. Conrad, Louis, and Baldwin insisted, Damascus was a holy city for Christianity. Like Jerusalem and Antioch, it would be a noteworthy prize in the eyes of European Christians. In July their armies assembled at Tiberias and marched to Damascus, around the Sea of Galilee by way of Banias. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total. The general view now appears to be that the decision to attack Damascus was somewhat inevitable. Historians, such as Martin Hoch, regard the decision as the logical outcome of Damascene foreign policy shifting into alignment with the Zengid dynasty. King Baldwin III had previously launched a campaign with the sole objective of capturing the city. This damaged the Burid dynasty's relations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Fiasco at Damascus Crusaders besieging Damascus The crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where orchards of Ghouta would provide them with a constant food supply. They arrived at Darayya on 23 July, with the army of Jerusalem in the vanguard, followed by Louis and then Conrad in the rearguard. The densely cultivated gardens and orchards would prove to be a serious obstacle for the crusaders. According to William of Tyre, the crusader army was prepared for battle:  24 July  Crusader King Conrad III in a 13th-century miniature On Saturday 24 July, the crusaders began with an attack in the morning along the banks of the Barada river, as far as al-Rabweh. The Muslims were well prepared and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. These orchards were defended by towers and walls and the crusaders were constantly pelted with arrows and lances along the narrow paths. There was a ferocious combat (pl) in the orchards and narrow roads at Mezzeh, between the Christian force and a mixture of professional troops of Damascus, the ahdath militia and Turkoman mercenaries. William of Tyre reported: The historian David Nicolle wrote that William of Tyre did not explain how Conrad was able to bring his forces up from the rear to the front without totally disorganizing the Christian army. Thanks to a charge by Conrad, the crusaders managed to fight their way through and chase the defenders back across the Barada river and into Damascus, in which fortifications were installed to cut off any possible supplies to Damascus from the Beqaa Valley. In the meantime, according to Syrian chronicler Abu Shama: Having arrived outside the walls of the city, the crusaders immediately put it to siege, using wood from the orchards. They attacked the suburbs of Faradis at first, they also began to build their siege position opposite Bab al-Jabiya, where the Barada did not run past Damascus. Inside the city the inhabitants barricaded the major streets, preparing for what they believed to be an inevitable assault. Unur had sought help from Saif ad-Din Ghazi I of Mosul and Nur ad-Din Zangi of Aleppo, and led an attack on the crusader camp; the crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, where they were prone to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.  25 July  During the counter-attack on Sunday, 25 July, the Damascus forces took heavy losses which included the 71-year-old lawyer and well known scholar named Yusuf al- Findalawi, the Sufi mystic Al-Halhli and soldier Nur al-Dawlah Shahinshah. By the end of 25 July, the crusaders set up a camp on the Green Field (Maydan al- Akhdar in modern-day Baramkeh), which was a grassy area used by the Damascene cavalry as a training ground.  26 July  The defenders launched an attack to the north of Damascus to repel the attackers, despite heavy fighting, they managed to clear the area and receive reinforcements from Lebanon and Sayf ad- Din on 26 July onward. During a raid on the crusader camp on 26 July, according to Abu Shama:  27 July  The crusaders probably intended to concentrate on the eastern and southern edge of the city, by attacking the weakest of the gates, Bab al-Saghir (Small Gate), built only of mud bricks. According to William of Tyre, on 27 July, the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, opposite Bab Tuma and Bab Sharqi, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water. There were conflicts in both camps: Unur could not trust Saif ad-Din or Nur ad-Din not to conquer the city if their offer of help was accepted; and the crusaders could not agree about who would receive the city if they captured it. Guy Brisebarre (de), lord of Beirut, was the suggestion of the local barons, but Thierry of Alsace, Count of Flanders, wanted it for himself and was supported by Baldwin, Louis, and Conrad. According to William of Tyre, the resulting dispute contributed to the final failure of the siege: 'for the local barons preferred that the Damascenes should keep their city rather than to see it given to the count', and so did all they could to ensure the siege collapsed.William of Tyre, XVII. 7. It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.  28 July  Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived at Homs and were negotiating with Unur for possession of Damascus, something that neither Unur nor the crusaders wanted. Saif ad-Din apparently also wrote to the crusaders, urging them to return home. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat back to Jerusalem on 28 July, though throughout their retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them. Historians such as Ralph of Coggeshall, John of Salisbury and the annalist of W√ºrzburg reported that the siege was abandoned when the Templars accepted a bribe, while William of Tyre and Michael the Syrian mentioned that the given coins were made of copper instead of gold. English historian Henry of Huntingdon summed up the whole expedition, by writing: Aftermath Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated by the failure. Each of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon but this was abandoned due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel I Komnenos. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. Legacy The French Crusader Robert de Brie, who took part in the Siege of Damascus in 1148, is sometimes credited for bringing the Damask rose from Syria to Europe. During the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, the French built Mezzeh prison in 1920s, on a hill-top structure dates back to crusader days, and used it to house anti-colonial fighters and political prisoners.

Plot  Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a popular silent film star with humble roots as a hoofer and stuntman. Don barely tolerates his vain, cunning, conniving, and shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina is convinced that they are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise. At the premiere of his latest film, The Royal Rascal, Don tells the gathered crowd a sarcastic, hyperbolic version of his life story, including his motto: \\"Dignity, always dignity.\\" His words are humorously contradicted by flashbacks showing him alongside his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor). (\\"Fit as a Fiddle\\") To escape from his fans after the premiere, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his \\"undignified\\" accomplishments as a movie star. Later, at an after party, the head of Don's studio, R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell), shows a short demonstration of a talking picture, but his guests are unimpressed. To Don's amusement, Kathy pops out of a mock cake right in front of him, revealing herself to be a chorus girl. (\\"All I Do is Dream of You\\") Furious at Don's teasing, she throws a real cake at him, only to accidentally hit Lina in the face and flee. Don becomes smitten with Kathy and searches for her for weeks, with Cosmo trying to cheer him up. (\\"Make 'Em Laugh\\") While filming a romantic scene, a jealous Lina reveals that her influence is behind Kathy's loss of work and subsequent disappearance. On the studio lot, Cosmo finally finds Kathy quietly working in another Monumental Pictures production (\\"Beautiful Girl\\") and gets Don. Don sings her a love song, and she confesses to having been a fan of his all along. (\\"You Were Meant for Me\\") After rival studio Warner Bros. has an enormous hit with its first talking picture, the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, R.F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, including Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. An exasperated diction coach tries to teach her how to speak properly, but to no avail. In contrast, Don fares better when taking diction lessons. (\\"Moses Supposes\\") The Dueling Cavaliers preview screening is a disaster; the actors are barely audible thanks to the awkward placing of the microphones, Don repeats the line \\"I love you\\" to Lina over and over, to the audience's derisive laughter, and in the middle of the film, the sound goes out of synchronization, with hilarious results as Lina shakes her head while the villain's deep voice says, \\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\\" and the villain nods his head while Lina's squeaky soprano says, \\"No! No! No!\\" Afterwards, (\\"Good Morning\\") Don, Kathy, and Cosmo come up with the idea to turn The Dueling Cavalier into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier, complete with a modern musical number and backstory. The three are disheartened when they realize Lina's terrible voice remains a problem; but Cosmo, inspired by a scene in The Dueling Cavalier where Lina's voice was out of sync, suggests that they dub Lina's voice with Kathy's. (\\"Singin' In the Rain\\") After hearing Don and Cosmo pitch the idea, R.F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina that Kathy is doing the dubbing. (\\"Broadway Melody\\") When Lina barges in on a dubbing session and learns the truth, (\\"Would You\\") she is infuriated. She becomes even angrier when she discovers that R.F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup afterward. Lina threatens to sue R.F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing for the rest of her career. R.F. reluctantly agrees, as a clause in Lina's contract states that the studio is responsible for positive media coverage of her. The premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R.F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \\"singing\\", (\\"Singin' in the Rain Reprise\\") Don, Cosmo, and R.F. gleefully raise the curtain, revealing the fakery. Lina flees in humiliation, and a distressed Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that she's \\"the real star\\" of the film. (\\"You Are My Lucky Star\\") Later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film, Singin' in the Rain.  Cast  * Gene Kelly as Donald (Don) Lockwood.

Songs  Singin' in the Rain was originally conceived by MGM producer Arthur Freed, the head of the \\"Freed Unit\\" responsible for turning out MGM's lavish musicals, as a vehicle for his catalog of songs written with Nacio Herb Brown for previous MGM musical films of the 1929‚Äì39 period.Feltenstein, George (2002). \\"Producer's Note,\\" included in the liner notes of the \\"Music from the original motion picture soundtrack (deluxe edition) Singin' in the Rain\\" double CD by Rhino Entertainment and Turner Classic Movies Screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green wrote two entirely new songs, \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" and \\"Moses Supposes\\", the latter with music director Roger Edens providing the music (see below).Track list in the liner notes of the \\"Music from the original motion picture soundtrack (deluxe edition) Singin' in the Rain\\" double CD by Rhino Entertainment and Turner Classic Movies. All songs have lyrics by Freed and music by Brown unless otherwise indicated. Some of the songs, such as \\"Broadway Rhythm,\\" \\"Should I?,\\" and especially \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" itself, have been featured in numerous films. The films listed below mark the first time each song was presented on screen. * \\"Fit as a Fiddle (And Ready for Love),\\" originally published in 1932 with music by Al Hoffman and Al Goodhart, lyrics by Freed. * \\"Temptation\\" (instrumental only) from Going Hollywood (1933). * \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" from Sadie McKee (1934). The arrangement in \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is an up tempo, upbeat, \\"flapper\\" version of the song with full instrumentation. In contrast, the \\"Sadie McKee\\" version is slower tempo, and appears routinely throughout the film as a love ballad accompanied by a solo ukulele. An instrumental only version with full orchestration is also part of the film's opening and closing theme. * \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" from The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (1929). * \\"Make 'Em Laugh,\\" considered an original song, but bearing a striking resemblance to Cole Porter's \\"Be a Clown\\" from another MGM Freed-produced musical, The Pirate (1948). Written by Comden and Green. * \\"Beautiful Girl Montage\\" comprising \\"I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'\\" from Broadway Melody of 1936 (1935), \\"The Wedding of the Painted Doll\\" from The Broadway Melody (1929), \\"Should I?\\" from Lord Byron of Broadway (1930) and \\"Beautiful Girl\\" from Stage Mother (1933) * \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" from The Broadway Melody (1929) * \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\" from Broadway Melody of 1936 (1935) * \\"Moses Supposes\\" (music by Roger Edens, lyrics by Comden and Green), based on the tongue-twister with the same title. * \\"Good Morning\\" from Babes In Arms (1939) * \\"Would You?\\" from San Francisco (1936) * \\"Broadway Melody\\" composed of \\"The Broadway Melody\\" from The Broadway Melody (1929) and \\"Broadway Rhythm\\" from Broadway Melody of 1936 (1935). The music for the \\"Broadway Ballet\\" section is by Nacio Herb Brown.  Production =History Arthur Freed, the head of the \\"Freed Unit\\" at MGM responsible for the studio's glossy and glamorous musicals, conceived the idea of a movie based on the back catalog of songs written by himself and Nacio Herb Brown, and called in Betty Comden and Adolph Green from New York to come up with a story to tie the songs together and to write the script. Comden and Green first refused the assignment, as their agent had assured them that their new contract with MGM called for them to write the lyrics to all songs unless the score was by Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, or Rodgers and Hammerstein. After a two-week hold-out, their new agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, having looked over the contract, told them that the clause had been entirely an invention of their previous agent, and that there was no such language in the contract. After hearing this, Comden and Green began working on the story and script.Comden & Green (1972), pp.1-4 Because many of the songs had originally been written during the time when silent films were giving way to \\"talkies\\", and musicals were popular with audiences, Comden and Green came up with the idea that the story should be set during that transitional period in Hollywood, an era they were intimately familiar with. When Howard Keel was mentioned as the possible lead, they tried to work up a story involving a star of Western films who makes a comeback as a singing cowboy, but they kept gravitating to a story about a swashbuckling romantic hero with a vaudeville background who survives the transition by falling back on his abilities as a song-and-dance man, a story which Gene Kelly was well-suited for.Comden & Green (1972), pp.4-5 Kelly could not be approached at the time, as he was deeply immersed in An American in Paris (1951), which he was starring in and co-choreographing with Stanley Donen. Comden and Green continued to work on the script, and had at that time three possible openings for the film: a silent movie premiere, a magazine interview with a Hollywood star, and a star- meets-girl, star-loses-girl sequence. Unable to decide which to use or how to proceed, they had just decided to return their advance to MGM and admit defeat, when Betty Comden's husband arrived from New York and suggested that they combine all three openings into one. The script with the re-written opening was approved by Freed and by MGM's head of production Dore Schary, who had recently replaced Louis B. Mayer.Comden & Green (1972), pp.5-8 By this time shooting on An American in Paris had completed, and Freed suggested that Kelly be given the script to read. Kelly and Donen responded enthusiastically, and immediately become involved in re-writes and adjustments to the script. Comden, Green, Kelly, and Donen were all old friends, and the process went smoothly. Besides the Freed-Brown songs, Comden and Green contributed the lyrics to \\"Moses Supposes\\", which was set to music by Roger Edens. Shortly before shooting began, \\"The Wedding of the Painted Dolls\\", which Comden and Green had \\"painfully wedged into the script as a cheering-up song\\" was replaced with a new Freed-Brown song, \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\".Comden & Green (1972), pp.8-9 After Comden and Green had returned to New York to work on other projects, they received word that a new song was needed for a love-song sequence between Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. The original had been a song-and- dance medley involving different sets in different soundstages on the studio lot, but they were asked for a romantic love song set in an empty sound stage, and it was needed immediately. Comden and Green provided such a scene for \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\" and sent it off to Hollywood.Comden & Green (1972), pp.9-10 Revisions from early drafts Trailer * In an early draft of the script, the musical number \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" was to be sung by Reynolds, O'Connor, and Kelly, emerging from a restaurant after the flop preview of The Dueling Cavalier, to celebrate the idea of changing the film into a musical.Hess & Dabholkar (2009), p.124 * Kelly singing \\"You Were Meant For Me\\" to Reynolds on an empty sound stage was not included in that draft. The number was originally conceived as Kelly singing a medley of other songs to her as they romped around various studio back lot sets.Hess & Dabholkarm (2009), pp.23-24 * Rita Moreno was originally to have sung the lead in \\"I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'\\" with other showgirls, but this ended up as part of the \\"Beautiful Girl Montage\\" without her.Hess & Dabholkar (2009), p.70  Scenes filmed but cut before release  * Gene Kelly sang a reprise of \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" after the party at R.F. Simpson's house when Kelly chases after Reynolds. The song, ending in Kelly's bedroom, was cut from the release version after two previews, and the footage has been lost.Hess & Dabholkarm (2009), p.173 * Reynolds' solo rendition of \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\" (to a billboard showing an image of Lockwood) was cut after previews. This number has survived and is included on the original soundtrack and DVD version of the film. * In the steamy \\"Vamp Dance\\" segment of the \\"Broadway Melody Ballet\\" with Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly, reviewers from both the Production Code and the Catholic Church's Legion of Decency objected to a brief, suggestive pose or movement between the dancers. Although there is no precise documentation of what or where it was, close examination of footage toward the end of the dance shows an abrupt cut when Charisse is wrapped around Kelly, indicating the probable location.Hess & Dabholkarm (2009), pp.180-181  Other notes  In the sequence in which Gene Kelly dances and sings the title song while spinning an umbrella, splashing through puddles and getting soaked with rain, Kelly was sick with a fever. The water used in the scene caused Kelly's wool suit to shrink during filming. A common myth is that Kelly managed to perform the entire song in one take, thanks to cameras placed at predetermined locations. However, this was not the case; filming the sequence took 2 to 3 days. Another myth is that the rain was mixed with milk in order for the drops to show up better on camera; but the desired visual effect was produced, albeit with difficulty, through backlighting.The Basics: Was There Really Milk in Singin‚Äô in the Rain? notes: \\"Gene Kelly himself described what happened in several interviews, including American Film (1979): 'Shooting the title number was just terrible for the photographer . He had to backlight all the rain and then he had to put frontlight on the performer. That was as tough a job as I‚Äôve ever seen, because you can‚Äôt photograph in rain and see it.'\\" Debbie Reynolds was not a dancer when she made Singin' in the Rain; her background was as a gymnast.New 50th Anniversary Documentary What a Glorious Feeling, hosted by Debbie Reynolds on the film's DVD. Kelly apparently insulted her for her lack of dance experience, upsetting her. In a subsequent encounter when Fred Astaire was in the studio, he found Reynolds crying under a piano. Hearing what had happened, Astaire volunteered to help her with her dancing. Kelly later admitted that he had not been kind to Reynolds and was surprised that she was still willing to talk to him afterwards. After shooting the \\"Good Morning\\" routine, which had taken from 8:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. to shoot, Reynolds' feet were bleeding. Years later, she was quoted as saying that \\"Singin' in the Rain and childbirth were the two hardest things I ever had to do in my life.\\"Patrick Perry, \\"ON TOUR WITH DEBBIE REYNOLDS: Feisty and Fit Actress Speaks Out About An All-Too-Common Problem - Overactive Bladder\\", The Saturday Evening Post, January/February 2003.

It was the tenth highest-grossing movie of the year in the US and Canada.'Top Box-Office Hits of 1952', Variety, January 7, 1953 Critical response Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \\"Compounded generously of music, dance, color spectacle and a riotous abundance of Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor on the screen, all elements in this rainbow program are carefully contrived and guaranteed to lift the dolors of winter and put you in a buttercup mood.\\" Variety was also positive, writing: \\"Arthur Freed has produced another surefire grosser for Metro in Singin' in the Rain.

Coe of The Washington Post called it \\"yet another fresh and breezy, colorful and funny musical\\" from Gene Kelly, adding, \\"Of the players there's not a dud in the lot, from Kelly's facile performing to the brief but electric dance appearance by Cyd Charisse, a swell partner for him.\\" Pauline Kael, the long-time film critic for The New Yorker, said of the film \\"This exhuberant and malicious satire of Hollywood in the late twenties is perhaps the most enjoyable of movie musicals - just about the best Hollywood musical of all time.\\"Comden & Green (1972), p.10 Roger Ebert placed Singin' in the Rain on his Great Movies list, calling the film \\"a transcendent experience, and no one who loves movies can afford to miss it.\\" On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a perfect 100% approval rating based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 9.27/10.

Early life Sprenger, the son of a farmer, was born in Oberhausen near Bad Bergzabern in the Palatinate. After graduating from high school, he served as a one-year military volunteer. From 1902 he was employed in the administrative service of the Imperial Postal Service. Sprenger volunteered for service in the First World War and became an NCO, at first training volunteers and reservists. He was then deployed to the front and saw action in France and in Russia where he was promoted to Leutnant. He was decorated for valor and awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. Discharged in 1918, he resumed his career as a postal inspector in Frankfurt. Nazi career In 1922, Sprenger became a member of the Nazi Party. He was anti-Semitic, and rose quickly through the ranks. When the Party was re- founded in February of 1925 after being banned in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch, Sprenger re-joined in August (membership number 17,009) and became a Bezirksleiter (Regional Leader) in Hesse-Nassau South. He also became an SA leader in Frankfurt. He was appointed Gauleiter of Hesse-Nassau South on 1 April 1927. In 1929 he joined the Frankfurt City Council. He also became the Nazi faction leader in the municipal and provincial Landtags. In September 1930 he was elected a member of the Reichstag for electoral constituency 19, Hesse-Nassau. The same year, he founded a Nazi newspaper in Frankfurt called Frankfurter Volksblatt. From 1930 to 1933 he also sat on the administrative board of the German Postal Service. On 15 July 1932 came his appointment as Landesinspekteur-Southwest. In this position, he had oversight responsibility for his Gau and four others (Baden, Hessen-Darmstadt, Hessse-Nassau North & W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern). This was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralize control over the Gaue. However, it was unpopular with the Gauleiters and was repealed on Strasser's fall from power in December 1932. Sprenger then returned to his Gauleiter position in Hesse-Nassau South. When his Gau was merged with the neighboring Gau of Hesse-Darmstadt (comprising the federal People's State of Hesse) on 1 January 1933, he became the Gauleiter of the unified Gau Hesse-Nassau. On 5 May 1933, Sprenger was appointed Reichsstatthalter of the People's State of Hesse. In the process of the Gleichschaltung, in particular due to the Reichsstatthaltergesetz (Reich Governors Law) of 30 January 1935, he was also appointed Minister-President and took over leadership of the state government from Philipp Wilhelm Jung on 1 March 1935. Besides Martin Mutschmann of Saxony, he was the only Gauleiter to simultaneously hold the positions of Reichsstatthalter and Minister- President. He was promoted to SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer in 1938. War years When the war broke out on 1 September 1939, Sprenger was named Reich Defense Commissioner for Wehrkreis (Military District) XII, based in Wiesbaden and on 16 November 1942 for Gau Hesse-Nassau. In 1943, the Oberpr√§sident (High President) of the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau, Philipp von Hessen, fell out of favor and was removed from office. Subsequently, the province was partitioned in two, effective 1 July 1944, and Sprenger was appointed Oberpr√§sident of the new Prussian Province of Nassau. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province, as he had already done in the State of Hesse. On the night of 25 to 26 March 1945, Sprenger fled from the advancing U.S. Army from Frankfurt to K√∂ssen, Austria, where the Russians and US Army were subsequently in a pincer to cover the whole country. Trapped, he and his wife committed suicide on 7 May 1945. ReferencesSources  Orlow, Dietrich: The History of the Nazi Party: 1919-1933 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1969, .

He was one of the first composers of this group, making him a contemporary of Gherardello da Firenze and Giovanni da Firenze. He concentrated mainly on madrigals, including both canonic (caccia-madrigal) and non-canonic types, but also composed a single example each of a caccia, lauda-ballata, and motet (; ). His setting of Non al suo amante, written about 1350, is the only known contemporaneous setting of Petrarch's poetry (; ). Jacopo's ideal was \\"suave dolce melodia\\" (sweet, gentle melody) . His style is marked by fully texted voice parts that never cross. The untexted passages which connect the textual lines in many of his madrigals are also noteworthy . He is well represented in the Squarcialupi Codex, the large collection of 14th century music long owned by the Medici family; twenty-nine compositions of his are found in that source, the principal source for music of the Italian ars nova, alongside music by Francesco Landini and others . A portrait of Jacopo is found in this manuscript, and another possible portrait is found in a north-Italian manuscript, Fulda, Landesbibliothek, Hs. D23, fol. 302 (; ). However, the identification of Jacopo as the subject of the painting in the latter source was made by a hand later than the manuscript copyist's, throwing some doubt on its reliability . In addition to his compositions, Jacopo also wrote a short theoretical treatise, Questa √® l'arte del biscanto misurato (; ), which is influenced by French notational theory . He may also have been active as a poet, to judge from the autobiographical texts of the madrigals Io me sun un che, Oselleto salvazo, and Vest√¨se la cornachia .

Hiking trails  View of Spicewood Springs taken along the Spicewood Springs trailThe Spicewood Springs trail is one of the hiking trails in the park with numerous creek crossings. The trail is one way, but hikers can take a slightly different hike back. It has numerous spring-fed swimming holes found along the trail. The Gorman Creek trail is divided into a blue-marker loop and a yellow- marker loop, with dry chaparral terrain. The highlights of the park trails are a travertine creek on the east, and a large waterfall with caves on the west. A protected portion of the park is open by guided tour only. The Gorman Spring and a couple of other springs feed Gorman Creek, which then descends a spectacular feet forming what is known as Gorman Falls. The tour is a round trip trail leading to the spectacular waterfall, which is formed by fern covered Travertine. The self-guided Gorman Spring trail and the trail to the waterfall is now open to the public during regular park hours.

The show starred Brett Butler as a single mother learning how to cope with raising her three children alone after finally divorcing her abusive husband. The series was created by Chuck Lorre and produced by Carsey-Werner Productions. Grace Under Fire was the highest-rated new comedy of the 1993‚Äì94 season.  Premise of show  Grace Under Fire, produced by Carsey-Werner, was part of a wave of shows in the late 1980s and 1990s that were built around a comedian (and in some cases, closely based on his or her comedy routine). Many of Carsey-Werner's shows were based on nontraditional, non-nuclear families. Grace Under Fire followed a similar formula, set in the small fictitious town of Victory, Missouri; Butler starred as Grace Kelly, a divorced single mother and recovering alcoholic. The show begins after the main character divorces her abusive alcoholic husband of eight years in an attempt to start life anew and prevent her children from making the same mistakes she did. The show revolved around Grace; her children, mischievous Quentin (Noah Segan, pilot; Jon Paul Steuer, seasons 1‚Äì3; Sam Horrigan, seasons 4‚Äì5), happy-go-lucky Libby (Kaitlin Cullum), and infant Patrick (Dylan and Cole Sprouse); her happily married best friends and neighbors, Nadine and Wade Swoboda (Julie White and Casey Sander); and the town's bachelor pharmacist, Russell Norton (Dave Thomas). All of them helped Grace keep whatever shreds of sanity she had left. In the first three seasons, the show had a very blue-collar appeal due to Grace's chosen line of work, post-divorce; she operated pipelines at the local oil refinery, and had a second family of fellow crew workers down at the plant. Among them were heavy- set Dougie Boudreau (Walter Olkewicz), friendly Vic (Dave Florek), and Carl (Louis Mandylor). Their gruff boss was Bill Davis (Charles Hallahan). Both Bill and Carl were dropped after the first season; while Carl had not had a permanent on-screen replacement, the crew's new boss was John Shirley (Paul Dooley) starting in the second season. Russell's friendship with Grace, and their on-and-off dating rituals, became a running theme in the series. Throughout their friendship, they often dated other people; for a time in 1994, Grace dated Ryan Sparks (William Fichtner), a quirky chemist who worked in the oil refinery's labs. In season three, Grace entered into a relationship with suave plant executive Rick Bradshaw (Alan Autry). As with Ryan, the affair between Grace and Rick occurred despite their radically different places in the company ladder. They broke up at the end of season three, although Rick returned in season four to see if their romance could be rekindled. In season four, Grace began taking college classes at night, paid for by her workplace. When the plant decided to stop funding her education about halfway through the season, Grace decided to quit the oil refinery and return to school full-time, as she only needed a few months of concentrated classes to graduate. The remainder of season four featured Grace as a full- time student, and towards the end of the season, she did, in fact, graduate. In the season finale, Grace took an entry-level position with an ad agency, having worked her way up to being a white-collar professional. At the beginning of the fifth season, however, Grace decided that the commute and long working hours at the St. Louis ad agency were forcing her to spend almost all of her time away from her family. She quit the agency job, and began working in the administrative/ business end for a local construction company owned by D.C. (Don \\"D.C.\\" Curry). Also in the fifth season, Russell found some romantic interest in Dottie (Lauren Tom), a gossiping hairstylist who was also friends with Grace. Nadine, meanwhile, after having given birth to her and Wade's long-awaited child, abruptly decided to leave Wade and move to Colorado, and was never seen again. (Actress Julie White had left the show between seasons four and five.) Throughout the entire five-year run, Grace's ex-husband Jimmy Kelly (Geoff Pierson) showed up, sometimes causing problems and at others miraculously clean and sober, trying to win Grace back. A reconciliation never quite happened, but the two did settle on a good friendship for the sake of the kids. In the midst of Jimmy's attempts to get straight, his father Emmett (guest star Matt Clark) died. In the aftermath of his death, Emmett was revealed to be gay. At this time, Jimmy's mother Jean (Peggy Rea), Grace's disapproving and moralizing former mother-in-law, offered to move in and help Grace raise the kids (Rea had previously guest-starred as Jean a few times since the series premiered). Russell, meanwhile, reconciled with his estranged dad, Floyd (Tom Poston). Seen twice late in season two, by season three, Floyd ended up moving in with Russell and working with him in the pharmacy, and appeared on a regular basis. As far as Grace's own kin and past life went, she had a regular source of support from her sister Faith (Valri Bromfield) in the first two seasons. Another development came when Grace was contacted by her first child, Matthew (guest star Tom Everett Scott), whom she gave up for adoption before meeting Jimmy. Matthew had questions about his ancestry and ended up meeting his biological father. By the fifth season, Dot had replaced Nadine as Grace's friend and confidant, but in early 1998, Dot stopped appearing on the show (though she was still mentioned). Instead, Grace's old friend Bev Henderson (Julia Duffy) came back to town and ended up moving in with the Kellys to get back in touch with her working-class roots. Grace and Bev's personal reunion was unexpectedly the last major storyline of the series. Although she was joining the cast full- time, Duffy only appeared in two episodes of Grace Under Fire before the series was abruptly cancelled in mid-February.

Ratings The show was the highest rated new show in its first season. In the month before Grace Under Fire first aired, Showtime broadcast the Carsey Werner-produced Brett Butler Special, a half-hour comedy performance by Butler. * 1993‚Äì1994: #5 (17.9 rating) * 1994‚Äì1995: #4 (18.8 rating) * 1995‚Äì1996: #13 (13.2 rating) * 1996‚Äì1997: #45 (tie) (9.1 rating) * 1997‚Äì1998: #68 (tie) Awards and nominations Grace Under Fire was nominated for three Golden Globe awards: Best Performance by an Actress in a TV Series Comedy/Musical in 1995 and 1997 and Best TV Series Comedy/Musical in 1995. Jean Stapleton was nominated for the 1995 Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy series Emmy Award for playing Aunt Vivian in the episode \\"The Road to Paris Texas.\\" Diane Ladd was nominated for the same award the previous year for playing Louise Burdett in the episode entitled \\"Things Left Undone\\" written by Brett Butler and Wayne Lemon. Controversy and cancellation As the third season concluded in the spring of 1996, Jon Paul Steuer left the series. Sources have speculated that Steuer's mother pulled him out of the show after an incident with Butler, who allegedly flashed her breasts at the 12-year-old actor. At the start of Season 4, Sam Horrigan became the third actor to play Quentin Kelly, and with him in the role, the character's age advanced to 15. In the fourth and fifth seasons of the show, Butler was fighting a painkiller addiction, for which she eventually sought medical help. Cast member Julie White left the show after Season 4, also citing Butler's behavior as the reason. The show, which had been a Top 20 series for its first three seasons, began to take a significant drop in the ratings during season four, from 13th place to 45th. Butler's first round of treatment and rehab delayed the start of the fifth season until November. After Grace Under Fire resumed production on season five, a newly clean Butler struggled to stay that way; the morale on the set was little better than in the previous season, due to the star's erratic behavior. Around the holidays, Butler relapsed again, and although the producers were as committed as ever to continuing the show, ABC was becoming concerned about Butler's overall health, and was less patient with her accelerated amount of missed tapings. The show's ratings continued to fall dramatically, which may have well been attributed to Butler's reputation in the press, the longer-than-usual hiatus the series took between seasons four and five, and the fact that the character of Grace Kelly no longer went through the kinds of struggles that had made the show successful earlier on. The addition of Julia Duffy several episodes into the fifth season was a last- ditch attempt to improve the ratings, but with Butler in her current state, the network was not inspired to continue on. Rather abruptly, with the February 17, 1998, telecast, ABC canceled the series. The three-month-long final season averaged at #68 in the 1997‚Äì98 Nielsen ratings. Syndication The series aired in syndication on the Oxygen Network in the United States, and TVtropolis in Canada. In the United Kingdom, the series was picked up by BBC2 where it aired from 1994 to 1999. The show was added to Hulu on March 1, 2014. The series is currently running on the Laff digital broadcast network that went on the air on April 15, 2015. Home media On May 4, 2015, it was announced that Visual Entertainment (VEI) had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1. Grace Under Fire: The Complete Collection was released on DVD on October 6, 2015. International remakes The show was remade in Russia as Lyuba, Children and the Factory in 2005. A Polish adaptation, Hela w opa≈Çach (Hela Under Fire; Hela is short form from Helen), aired on TVN in September 2006. Also there is another Russian adaptation as –û–ª—å–≥–∞ (Olga). The show premiered on TNT on September 5, 2016.

(2000). Quest for the African Dinosaurs: Ancient Roots of the Modern World. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 250. It takes its name from the Nandi people who live in western Kenya, in the area the Nandi Bear is reported from. It is also known as Chemosit, Kerit, Koddoelo, Ngoloko, or Duba (which derives from the Arabic words dubb or d.ab ï / d.abu ï for 'bear' and 'hyena' respectivelyHans Wehr (edited by J. Milton Cowan): A dictionary of modern written Arabic, ed. 3, Ithaca, N.Y., 1971, Spoken Language Services, Inc.). The Samburu \\"Nkampit\\" appears also to be a version of this creature. Description Descriptions of the Nandi bear are of a ferocious, powerfully built carnivore with high front shoulders (over four feet tall) and a sloping back. Stories of the Nandi bear state that it is fierce, nocturnal, stands on its hind legs and can kill animals.Journals and Magazines. The Lancet, 1914. Charles William Hobley authored a diagram of its supposed foot in 1913.Hobley, C. W. (1913). On Some Unidentified Beasts. Journal of the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society 6: 48‚Äì52. The Nandi people call it \\"kerit\\". Local legend holds that the Nandi bear has reddish hair, long feet and is said to scalp people. In 1961, Gardner Soule noted that sightings were reported in Kenya throughout the 19th century and early 20th century but it has \\"never has been caught or identified\\". Sightings of the Nandi bear decreased over time. In 1983, Richard Meinertzhagen speculated that it may have been an \\"anthropoid ape now extinct on account of decreased rainfall.\\"Meinertzhagen, Richard. (1983). Kenya Diary (1902-1906). Eland Books. p. 206 Scientific evaluation Nandi bear illustration, 1961 There is no scientific evidence that the Nandi bear exists. Alleged sightings are suggested to be misidentification of known species.Pocock, Reginald I. (1930). The Story of the Nandi Bear. Natural History Magazine 2: 162‚Äì169. In 1923, Charles William Andrews suggested that the Nandi bear may be a surviving representative of the extinct Chalicothere.Wayland, E. J. (1934). Rifts, Rivers, Rains and Early Man in Uganda. The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 64: 333‚Äì352. In the 1930s Louis Leakey suggested that Nandi Bear descriptions matched that of the Chalicothere, though chalicotheres were herbivores.Leakey, Louis S. (November 2, 1935). Does the Chalicothere‚ÄîContemporary of the Okapi‚Äî Still Survive?. Illustrated London News 187: 730‚Äì733. The Chalicothere hypothesis was later abandoned. In 2000, paleontologist Louis L. Jacobs commented that \\"if chalicotheres existed now, they would have been found out just like the giant forest hog was.\\" He concluded that \\"if there is anything to the Nandi-bear story besides imagination, I suspect it may be the word-of-mouth description of gorillas passed across the continent from areas where they live to areas where they do not.\\" Zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock claimed that reports of the Nandi bear were misidentified hyena, specifically the Spotted hyena. In 1932, the Natural History Museum stated that many reports of the Nandi Bear have \\"proved to have been nothing more than a spotted hyena.\\"Game Animals of the Empire. The Trustees of the British Museum, 1932. p. 46 Paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson attributed sightings of the Nandi bear to the honey badger or ratel. Simpson commented that the Nandi bear \\"turned out to be in most if not all cases a ratel, an animal which had been known to scientific zoologists since 1776.\\" In popular culture *The Nandi bear (spelled \\"Nandibear\\") appears as a monster in the Fighting Fantasy gamebook series. * The Peculiar Exploits of Brigadier Ffellowes, a collection of contemporary fantasy stories by Sterling E. Lanier, includes a short story called \\"His Only Safari,\\" in which the title character briefly sights a \\"kerit\\" and speculates that such creatures formed the basis for the Egyptian legends of Anubis. * Tarzan #134 (Gold Key Comics), March 1963, features Tarzan meeting and later battling a Nandi bear which is pictured as a shaggy sloth bear-like creature with floppy ears. * Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a fantasy role playing game published in 2009 by Paizo Publishing, features the Chemosit, described as a \\"massive, shaggy beast, uses long and muscular forearms to raise itself onto its hind legs and beats its chest like a gorilla. Despite its ape-like stance, its frame is far heavier and its features more primitive\\". The magical beasts special ability is the 'Brain Eater' - if the Chemosit kills an opponent with a coup de grace attack, it breaks open the creature's skull and devour's what's inside.

Wrestling (August 27, 2010).Lisa S. Davis, \\"Ex-wrestler Luna Vachon, 48, found dead \\", Tampa Bay Online (August 31, 2010).Greg Oliver, \\"Canadian Hall of Fame: Luna Vachon\\", SLAM! Wrestling. Over the course of her 22-year career, she wrestled for promotions such as the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), Extreme Championship Wrestling, the American Wrestling Association, and World Championship Wrestling. She was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2019. Career=Training As a child, Gertrude Vachon wanted to continue her family's wrestling legacy. Attending wrestling events she used to play in the ring, which often resulted in training with various World Wide Wrestling Federation stars. Her family objected to her entering the wrestling business and tried to dissuade her, as they considered a wrestler's life at that time too harsh for a female. Andr√© the Giant, with whom she was close and who took her on a trip to Paris in 1974, also tried to dissuade her. Around the age sixteen, she began training under her aunt Vivian and then The Fabulous Moolah. Early career (1985-1992) Gertrude started her professional career wrestling for Moolah's all-women's promotion. She then moved to Florida and, competing under the ring name Angelle Vachon, became a member of a four-woman wrestling troupe led by Mad Maxine. While in Florida, she shared residence with wrestlers Scott Levy (later known as Raven), and Denny Brown. In 1985, she debuted in Florida Championship Wrestling, as a young, soft-spoken reporter named Trudy Herd, who was giving Kendall Windham an award. A melee ensued and she was slapped twice by Kevin Sullivan.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e64m7VC92fE The angle had her driven mad by Sullivan's treatment and she ended up joining Sullivan's Army of Darkness stable under the new ring name, Luna Vachon.Brett Hoffman, \\"Catching up with Luna Vachon\\", WWE.com (March 14, 2007). As part of her gimmick, she shaved one half of her head, which was the first step to her trademark Mohawk hairstyle, covered her face in bodypaint, and continuously sneered. Looking back, Vachon expressed her uneasiness about some elements of this angle.Feinstein video Shoot interview, Summary at TheSmartMarks.com. During her time in Florida, Luna first wrestled Madusa Miceli, beginning a long-lasting in-ring rivalry. Beginning in Florida, Luna teamed up with The Lock as the Daughters of Darkness, a part of Sullivan's Army. The duo also provided back-up vocals for the thrash metal band Nasty Savage. In early 1987, Luna and Lock appeared in the Continental Wrestling Association.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Tz4uKJSbk During the next three years, Luna also traveled to Japan, where her father Butcher Vachon acting as her manager, as well as Puerto Rico. She also wrestled in David McLane's Powerful Women of Wrestling (POWW) and, during POWW's alliance with the American Wrestling Association (AWA), participated in the latter's only pay- per-view event, SuperClash III in December 1988, competing in a Battle royal. In the early nineties she took over management of The Blackhearts, a masked tag team coming out of Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling. The team consisted of Tom Nash ‚Äî a childhood friend of Luna and her then-husband ‚Äî and David Heath, her future husband, under the names \\"Apocalypse\\" and \\"Destruction\\", respectively. Luna worked with them in Joel Goodhart's Tri-State Wrestling, in Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation, and finally Giant Baba's All- Japan, where the team split up. Luna also worked at Wild Women of Wrestling, as a competitor, commentator, and booker.Profile at WrestlingData.comHoward Brody, Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling. Preview at SLAM! Wrestling (September 20, 2009). World Wrestling Federation (1993‚Äì1994) In 1992, while wrestling in Puerto Rico, she tried to get David Heath a job with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which resulted in the WWF developing an interest in her. They hired her, but not without some complications. No one actually knew exactly where she was; even her father only knew that she was staying in Florida. The WWF actually hired a private investigator to find her. When she was found, she was working as a waitress at a restaurant. Luna's first WWF appearance was in April 1993 at WrestleMania IX, accompanying Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels in his match against Tatanka, who was accompanied by Michaels' former valet Sensational Sherri. After the match, Luna attacked Sensational Sherri at ringside and later in the first aid area, starting a vicious feud between the two. At the same time Luna and Sherri were at odds, Bam Bam Bigelow had a confrontation with Sherri. This led to him being attacked by Tatanka and the two of them feuding. Soon after, Bam Bam (kayfabe) announced that he had fallen in love and presented Luna as his \\"main squeeze\\". He also endearingly called her his \\"Tick\\", which fans combined with her name to the chant \\"Luna- tic\\". From then, Bam Bam was seen blowing kisses to Luna at the end of matches, and in her honor even included the Moonsault, redubbed Lunasault, into his repertoire. A mixed tag team match between the two pairs was planned for SummerSlam in 1993, but had to be canceled because Luna legitimately injured her arm and then Sherri left the WWF. Instead, Bigelow and The Headshrinkers fought and lost to Tatanka and The Smokin' Gunns in a six-man tag team match. In the autumn of 1993, Bam Bam and Luna ran afoul of some practical jokes from Doink the Clown, leading to a Survivor Series style match at the 1993 event of the same name pitting Bam Bam, The Headshrinkers, and Bastion Booger against four Doinks (actually Men on a Mission and The Bushwhackers in clown makeup). During this time Luna was the cause of dissension between Bam Bam and his part-time tag team partner Bastion Booger, who had also (kayfabe) fallen in love with her. At WrestleMania X, Bam Bam and Luna finally got their revenge on Doink by beating the Clown and his midget side-kick Dink in a mixed tag team match. When the WWF's women's division was revived, Luna's old rival Madusa, who had entered the WWF under the name Alundra Blayze, won the Women's Championship. Luna set her eyes on the title and had a series of matches with Alundra, all resulting in victories for Blayze. It was during this time the relationship between Luna and Bam Bam first showed cracks after interference in a match backfired. In the summer, Luna sold Bam Bam's contract to Ted DiBiase, who was beginning to build his \\"Million Dollar Corporation\\". Luna then picked Japanese wrestler Bull Nakano to win the Women's title from Blayze, which she eventually did. Luna, however, left the WWF shortly after this title match. In 1994, Luna was the first woman to appear in a WWF video game, when - despite objections - she was included in WWF Raw. Independents and Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994‚Äì1996) After leaving the WWF, Luna wrestled on the independent circuit. Upon the recommendation of Kevin Sullivan's wife Nancy, she entered Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). She was brought as Tommy Dreamer's new valet in his long running feud with Raven (Scott Levy). Dreamer announced Luna as \\"someone out of your past\\", as Luna had been housemate to Levy in her Florida days and both had simultaneously worked in the WWF. While in ECW, Luna would stand with Tommy, feuding with Raven and his lackeys, which included Stevie Richards, and even her husband The Vampire Warrior (who, in kayfabe, had become jealous of the time she was spending with Dreamer). She had more than a few physical confrontations with Richards, including a steel cage match, which she won. In the same year, she was rated #306 in the PWI 500 PWI500 at Genickbruch.comPWI500 at WrestlingData.com - the second woman to be included in that list after Miss Texas. In 1996/97, she competed in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council and American Wrestling Federation, using the name Angel Baby',Profile at Online World of Wrestling. and the IWA Mid-South.1996 matches at Genickbruch.com.1997 matches at Genickbruch.com.1996 matches at WrestlingData.com.1997 matches at WrestlingData.com. World Championship Wrestling (1997) In early 1997, Luna had a short run with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), again going after her rival Madusa. Luna interfered in Madusa's matches against WCW Women's Champion Akira Hokuto, preventing a title win by Madusa. Luna and Madusa met each other in a series of matches, including a match at the 1997 Slamboree. Although Luna dominated the matches, Madusa managed to get the pinfall every time. Return to WWF (1997‚Äì2000) Later in 1997, Luna returned to the WWF, first as Goldust's manager, helping him to reinvent himself as \\"The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust\\". The pair sported a variety of different outfits and roles, including a dominatrix, a slave, a \\"New Year Baby\\", and his nurse. Their first feud was against Vader. Luna's first appearance had her wheeling the allegedly paralyzed Goldust to the ring and then blinding Vader with some \\"medical fluid\\". Later when Goldust, dressed like a Christmas tree, recited poems in the ring, he was attacked by Santa Claus, who turned out to be Vader. Vader eventually defeated Goldust at the 1998 Royal Rumble. The Goldust/Luna pairing also took to imitating other wrestler's gimmicks, often those of Goldust's opponents. At one point Goldust and Luna impersonated European Champion Triple H and Chyna in a title match against Owen Hart. What Triple H had intended as a joke resulted in Owen beating Goldust and Commissioner Slaughter awarding the title to Hart, considering Goldust to be a legit replacement. Vachon during her second WWF stint At this time, Goldust also teamed up with Marc Mero, which led to another feud, as Luna and Mero's valet Sable started to fight outside of the ring. The feud culminated in a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania XIV, pitting the two couples against each other. After this, Luna challenged Sable to an Evening Gown match at Unforgiven and scored the victory by stripping her opponent down to her underwear. The animosity between Luna and Sable was not entirely kayfabe. As Sable's popularity increased, she adopted a presumptuous attitude towards other competitors. According to Luna, as the two trained in the preparation for their WrestleMania match, Sable refused to learn how to \\"take bumps\\", while Luna was threatened by WWF officials that hurting her opponent in the ring would put her job in jeopardy. Sable also annoyed Luna with bragging about being promised the Women's Championship, a goal that had eluded the veteran Canadian. Luna was also hurt after she had carried Sable in their match, as Sable was universally congratulated while Luna was only consoled by Owen Hart. Still, Luna described the match as a highlight in her career. In August 1998, Luna had apparently patched up her differences with Sable, as the latter, now split from Marc Mero, introduced her as the newest member of the Human Oddities stable. Luna attacked Marc Mero's new valet Jacqueline, the former Miss Texas. Luna scored a pinfall victory in August, but lost a rematch in September. In December, Sable, who had won the reinstated WWF Women's Championship, was attacked by the masked \\"Spider Lady\\", who turned out to be Luna. She justified her heel turn and attack towards her partner with the words: \\"It's about me, it's about what I deserve.\\" In this feud against Sable, Shane McMahon personally supported Luna's efforts to win the championship after taking personal offense to Sable's attitude towards him and booked a Leather Strap match at the Royal Rumble. Leading up to that event, in the storyline, Luna was repeatedly attacked by an obsessed Sable fan. At the Royal Rumble, Sable successfully retained the title thanks to the interference of that fan, who now entered WWF competition as Tori. During the weeks prior to the Royal Rumble, Luna also defeated Gillberg, a WWF parody of World Championship Wrestling's star Goldberg. Luna was due to challenge Sable for another title shot several weeks later at St. Valentine's Day Massacre, but the match was canceled due to Luna's suspension for fighting with Sable backstage. Six months later, Luna returned at SummerSlam, chasing then Women's Champion Ivory backstage after a successful title defense against Tori. This started a feud between the two with Luna even scoring a pinfall victory during an impromptu, non-title match. At Unforgiven, however, she lost to Ivory in a Hardcore Rules match. During that feud, Luna also answered a challenge from then Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett and defeated him via disqualification, thanks to Ivory's interference. From then on, Luna reassumed her role as manager for her husband, now working for the WWF under the name Gangrel, participating in several mixed tag team matches and helping Gangrel beat his opponents. At Survivor Series in 1999, she joined forces with her former rivals Ivory, Jacqueline, and Terri Runnels, against Tori, Debra, The Fabulous Moolah, and Mae Young. Luna's team was defeated when Moolah pinned Ivory. At the Royal Rumble in 2000, she participated in the Swim Suit Contest, though in protest against the whole event she refused to take off her gown. This angle reflected Luna's legit dissatisfaction with the \\"sexualization\\" of the WWF's women's division. Vachon then became involved in a brief feud with Jacqueline after the latter had pinned Harvey Wippleman to capture the Women's title. She was the first person to challenge Jacqueline on the February 7 edition of Raw, but failed following a German Suplex. Gangrel, who accompanied her to ringside, responded by executing his Impaler DDT on the champion. This led to a mixed tag on the following episode of SmackDown, in which Vachon and Gangrel defeated Moore and her partner Prince Albert. She was later released from the WWF in early 2000 due to another outburst backstage. Independent circuit (2000‚Äì2007) After leaving the WWF, Luna continued to manage Gangrel during her independent tours all over the world, as well as wrestling on her own. Venues included the IWA Puerto Rico in 2000,2000 matches at WrestlingData.com.2000 matches at Genickbruch.com. the Australian World Wrestling All-Stars in 2001,2001 matches at WrestlingData.com.2001 matches at Genickbruch.com. the German EWP in 2003,2003 matches at WrestlingData.com.2003 matches at Genickbruch.com. the British ASW in 20062006 matches at WrestlingData.com.2006 matches at Genickbruch.com. and WSU in 2007.2007 matches at WrestlingData.com.2007 matches at Genickbruch.com. Whilst touring the UK with WWA in 2001 she was defeated by husband Gangrel in a Black Wedding Match. On June 9, 2007, Luna became the first Great Lakes Championship Wrestling's Ladies champion defeating Traci Brooks. On December 5, 2007, Luna Vachon announced her retirement; her last match took place on December 7 for Great Lakes Championship Wrestling in Milwaukee. She successfully defended her GLCW Ladies Championship against Traci Brooks and then retired as champion. Personal life Born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Charles Henry Wilkerson and Rebecca \\"Van\\" Pierce, Luna was adopted by Butcher Vachon in 1966, when he married her mother Van, his second wife, and continued to raise her as his daughter after the marriage split. By virtue of the adoption, Luna is also the niece of \\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon and Vivian Vachon. She was also close to Andr√© the Giant. Luna was married three times, first to Dan Hurd, with whom she had two sons, Joshua (born 1980) and Van (born 1982), who competed on the sixth and seventeenth seasons of Fox's reality cooking show Hell's Kitchen.\\"Into The Fire Hell's Kitchen contestant has ties to Terrell\\".

The sweep is often the person with the most experience, not always the fastest, but certainly with a reliable motorcycle who is not going to be the person who breaks down or has a crash themselves. Having at least a basic amount of mechanical experience and tools is a plus, so field repairs may be made if necessary. Sometimes, the sweep function is performed by a truck or other vehicle that may also have a trailer. This is usually for very long trips that cover many miles on the highway as on twisty backroads the pickup and trailer may not be able to maintain the same speeds as the motorcycles.

They are key components of the benthic communities of many freshwater and marine ecosystems. In freshwater aquaria they may be referred to as detritus worms.  Description  These worms can vary in size, from centimeters to millimeters, depending on the subfamily. They are all hermaphroditic and lack a larval stage.  Taxonomy  Analysis of 18S rDNA sequences has revealed that the family may not be monophyletic. However, the worst paraphyly was corrected with uniting the Naidinae with the other families. This necessitated a change of names under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature rules, as Naididae was now the senior synonym of Tubificidae. It was proposed to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to suppress Naididae because the \\"tubificids\\" are the more well-known group of the two, but that was rejected. The family Naididae is divided into six subfamilies, arranged here in the presumed phylogenetic sequence: * Tubificinae, containing (among others) the genus Tubifex * Naidinae Ehrenberg, 1828 * Telmatodrilinae Eisen, 1879 * Limnodriloidinae Ers√©us, 1982 * Phallodrilinae Brinkhurst, 1971 * Pristininae Lastoƒçkin, 1921, often included in Naidinae * Rhyacodrilinae Hrabƒõ, 1963 Presence in aquariums In an aquarium, numbers of naididae can increase rapidly. When their population becomes high, the worms migrate toward the surface of the water for access to higher concentrations of oxygen. Although detritus worms may not cause harm to aquarium fish, their appearance is an indication of poor water quality mainly due to overfeeding and lack of good water sanitation. Improvement of water quality, filtration, gravel cleaning, and the reduction of feeding, may be performed to bring detritus worm population back to normal. Detritus worms feed on excess food and waste, thereby contributing to the ecosystem of an aquarium.

It works by reducing the processor's clock rate and voltage when the processor is idle. The aim of this technology is to reduce overall power consumption and lower heat generation, allowing for slower (thus quieter) cooling fan operation. The objectives of cooler and quieter result in the name Cool'n'Quiet. The technology is similar to Intel's SpeedStep and AMD's own PowerNow!, which were developed with the aim of increasing laptop battery life by reducing power consumption. Due to their different usage, Cool'n'Quiet refers to desktop and server chips, while PowerNow! is used for mobile chips; the technologies are similar but not identical. This technology was also introduced on \\"e-stepping\\" Opterons, however it is called Optimized Power Management, which is essentially a re-tooled Cool'n'Quiet scheme designed to work with registered memory. Cool'n'Quiet is fully supported in the Linux kernel from version 2.6.18 onward (using the powernow-k8 driver) and FreeBSD from 6.0-CURRENT onward. Implementation In-order to take advantage of Cool'n'Quiet Technology in Microsoft's Operating Systems: * Cool'n'Quiet should be Enabled in system BIOS * In Windows XP and 2000: Operating Systems \\"Minimal Power Management\\" profile must be active in \\"Power Schemes\\" whereas, * In Windows Vista and 7: \\"Minimum processor state\\" found in \\"Processor Power Management\\" of \\"Advanced Power Settings\\" should be lower than \\"100%\\". Also In Windows Vista and 7 the \\"Power Saver\\" power profile allows much lower power state (frequency and voltage) than in the \\"High Performance\\" power state. Unlike Windows XP, Windows Vista only supports Cool'n'Quiet on motherboards that support ACPI 2.0 or later. With earlier versions of Windows, processor drivers along with Cool'n'Quiet software also need to be installed. The latest version is 1.3.2.0. Third party utilities In addition to the CPU drivers offered by AMD, several motherboard manufacturers have released software to give the end user more control over the Cool 'n' Quiet feature, as well as the other new features of AMD processors and chipsets. Using these applications, one can even control the CPU voltage explicitly. # PhenomMsrTweaker (SourceForge link) # RMClock Processors supporting Cool'n'Quiet * Athlon XP * Athlon 64 and X2 ‚Äì all models * Athlon 64 FX ‚Äì FX-53 (Socket 939 only) and higher * FX (Socket 942) * Athlon II ‚Äì all models * Sempron ‚Äì Socket 754: 3000+ and higher; Socket AM2: 3200+ and higher * Opteron ‚Äì E-stepping and higher, branded as Optimized Power Management * Phenom ‚Äì all versions support Cool'n'Quiet 2.0 * Phenom II ‚Äì supports Cool'n'Quiet 3.0 * some of the APUs * Ryzen ‚Äì 3, 5, 7, and 9 all models support Cool ‚Äòn‚Äô Quiet * EPYC See also * Dynamic frequency scaling Power Saving Technologies: * AMD PowerNow!

Hermann Giesler (2 April 1898, Siegen - 20 January 1987, D√ºsseldorf) was a German architect during the Nazi era, one of the two architects most favoured and rewarded by Adolf Hitler (the other being Albert Speer). Early life and World War II Hermann Giesler completed his architectural study at the Academy for Applied Arts in Munich. Starting from 1930 he worked as an independent architect. In 1933 he became master of building of districts in Sonthofen and 1937, became a professor. Up to 1938 he designed the \\"Ordensburg\\" in Sonthofen, planned Gau Forums in Weimar and Augsburg, and the \\"university\\" for the NSDAP at Chiemsee. Also, Giesler refurbished different buildings (such as the \\"Hotel of the Elephant\\" in Weimar). In addition, he was commissioned to build Hitler's house in Munich. In 1938 he was ordered by Hitler to the \\"General Building Inspector\\" for the reorganization of the city of Munich. Later he became also a director in the Organisation Todt, then one of the directors of the Group of Works of VI (Bavaria, Donaugaue). Starting in 1941, after fellow architect Roderich Fick fell out of political favour, Giesler was entrusted by Hitler with the reorganization of the entire city of Linz. Beginning from 1942 he worked on plans and a large model for the Danube Development of the Banks. In August 1943, Giesler became a member of the Reichstag.Erich Stockhurst: 5000 heads. VMA-Verlag, Wiesbaden 1967 Starting from 1944, he also worked on designs for the cultural center, which Hitler regarded with particular interest. Giesler joined the Nazi Party in 1941 in Organisation Todt (OT) as head of the \\"Assembly for the Baltic States Giesler\\", as head of the Einsatzgruppe Russia North of the OT (1942-1944), and as Director of the OT-Einsatzgruppe VI (Bayern und Danube gaue). Concentration camp prisoners built weapons in the underground factories (1944-1945). Throughout the war, Giesler and Speer had several heated arguments about architectural styles. In September 1944 Giesler was named one of the Reich's most important artists in the Gottbegnadeten list. After the war In 1945, Giesler was initially arrested by the U.S. military and interned as a Nazi, and charged in 1946. In 1947, he was indicted by a U.S. military court for war crimes in the concentration camp M√ºhldorf, a subcamp of Dachau. Giesler was sentenced to life imprisonment, but on 6 May 1948 his sentence was reduced to 25 years imprisonment. On 7 July 1951, it was lowered once again to twelve years. Giesler was freed on 18 October 1952. He settled in D√ºsseldorf, where he worked in 1953 as an independent architect and author. Giesler published his autobiographical writings, which appeared both in right-wing publishers (see below), as a commitment to Nazism and Adolf Hitler. Giesler wrote Ein anderer Hitler (Another Hitler), a personal memoir about his relationship with the dictator. He died in 1987. Literature *Another Hitler. Report of architect Hermann Giesler.

In United States v. Jewell, the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of knowledge as to criminal possession and importation of drugs.Criminal Law ‚Äì Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Although the term was originally‚Äîand still is‚Äîused in legal contexts, the phrase \\"willful ignorance\\" has come to mean any situation in which people intentionally turn their attention away from an ethical problem that is believed to be important by those using the phrase (for instance, because the problem is too disturbing for people to want it dominating their thoughts, or from the knowledge that solving the problem would require extensive effort).  Precedent in the United States  In United States v. Jewell, the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of knowledge as to criminal possession and importation of drugs. In a number of cases in the United States of America, persons transporting packages containing illegal drugs have asserted that they never asked what the contents of the packages were and so lacked the requisite intent to break the law. Such defenses have not succeeded, as courts have been quick to determine that the defendant should have known what was in the package and exercised criminal recklessness by failing to find out the package's contents. Notably, this rule has only ever been applied to independent couriers, and has never been used to hold larger services that qualify as common carriers (e.g., FedEx, United Parcel Service, or the U.S. Postal Service) liable for the contents of packages they deliver. A famous example of such a defense being denied occurred in In re Aimster Copyright Litigation,334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003) in which the defendants argued that the file-swapping technology was designed in such a way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. They suggested that their inability to monitor the activities of users meant that they could not be contributing to copyright infringement by the users. The court held that this was willful blindness on the defendant‚Äôs part and would not constitute a defense to a claim of contributory infringement.

Schwartz is a professor emeritus of mathematics at the College of Staten Island; president emeritus of the Jewish Vegetarians of North America (JVNA); and co-founder and coordinator of the Society of Ethical and Religious Vegetarians (SERV). He is best known as a Jewish vegetarian activist and advocate for animal rights in the United States and Israel. Early life Schwartz was born in Arverne, New York in 1934. His father, Joseph (Zundel), was 31 at the time, and his mother, Rose, was 29. They were not vegetarians, nor was he a vegetarian as a youth. He describes his upbringing as being a \\"meat and potatoes person\\" whose favorite dish was pot roast. In 1975, he began teaching a course called \\"Mathematics and the Environment\\" at the College of Staten Island. Schwartz married Loretta Suskind on February 14, 1960 at the Utopia Jewish Center in Queens. He reports that he became vegetarian in 1977 and vegan in 2000. Activism As an Orthodox Jew, Schwartz began to explore what Judaism had to say about diet, ecology, and the proper treatment of animals. The result was his best-known book, Judaism and Vegetarianism. It was first published in 1982, with later, expanded editions published in 1988 and 2001. It explores vegetarianism from the standpoint of biblical, Talmudic, and rabbinical references, and concludes that vegetarianism is the highest form of kosher and the best diet for Jews in the modern world. The second edition was a B'nai Brith Book Club Selection that same year. Schwartz argues that the realities of animal-based diets and agriculture conflict with basic Jewish mandates to preserve human health, treat animals with compassion, protect the environment, conserve natural resources, help hungry people, and pursue peace. He has been active in a variety of vegetarian and animal rights organizations, and on July 2005 was inducted into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame by the North American Vegetarian Society (NAVS).North American Vegetarian Society website The ceremony was held at the 31st Annual NAVS Summerfest on the University of Pittsburgh campus. Schwartz also spoke at the Summerfest on \\"Judaism and Vegetarianism\\" and \\"Ten Approaches to Obtain a Vegetarian-Conscious World by 2010.\\" In 2010, Schwartz served as a Green Zionist Alliance delegate to the World Zionist Congress. Schwartz was involved in the formation of the Jewish Vegetarians of North America. He became president of the organization in 2002 and continues to serve as president emeritus. Schwartz also reaches out to vegetarians from other religions, and his writings helped inspire the formation of the Christian Vegetarian Association, and their original campaign and literature, namely \\"What Would Jesus Eat...Today?\\" This campaign has more recently evolved into the broader \\"Honoring God's Creation\\" campaign and has strongly influenced the Christian vegetarian movement. He also is president of the interfaith group, \\"Society of Ethical and religious Vegetarians (SERV).

Early life  Pitcairne was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. After obtaining some classical education at the school of Dalkeith, Pitcairne entered Edinburgh University in 1668, and took his degree of MA in 1671. Having been sent to France for the benefit of his health, he was induced at Paris to begin the study of medicine, and after courses at Edinburgh and Paris he obtained in 1680 the degree of MD at Reims University.  Private practice and academic appointment  He began practice at Edinburgh, and was appointed one of three professors of medicine at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1685. In a short time he acquired so great a reputation that in 1692 he was appointed to the Chair of the Practice of Medicine at the University of Leiden. Among his pupils were Richard Mead and George Cheyne and both of them attributed much of their skill to what they had learned from Pitcairne. During Pitcairne's time in Leiden, he is also thought to have taught the great Dutch physician and \\"father of physiology\\" Herman Boerhaave. In 1693 Pitcairne returned to Scotland to marry a daughter of Sir Archibald Stevenson, an eminent physician in Edinburgh. The family objected to her going abroad, so he did not return to Leiden, but settled once more in Edinburgh. He rose to be the first physician in Scotland, and was frequently called into consultation both in England and the Netherlands.  Anatomical studies  Opuscula medica, 1716 Soon after his return to Edinburgh, Pitcairne made an offer to the town council that would see him and some of his colleagues treat paupers for free at the hospital of Paul's Work at the foot of Calton Hill. In return, he requested that he could dissect the bodies of those that died at the hospital and went unclaimed by their relatives, and who had to be buried at the town's expense. While some of Edinburgh's surgeons strongly opposed the arrangement, the town council eventually accepted Pitcairne's offer, which provided an early boost to the teaching of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Pitcairne's medical opinions are chiefly contained in a volume of Dissertationes medicae which he published in 1701 (2nd ed. 1713). Pitcairne was close friends with mathematician David Gregory, with whom he wrote mathematical papers, which in turn informed his hypothesis that Newtonian physics more accurately described bodily functions than the balance of humours. The Dissertationes build on this idea and discuss the circulation of the blood in the smaller vessels, the difference in the quantity of the blood contained in the lungs of animals in the womb and of the same animals after birth, the motions by which food becomes fit to supply the blood, the cure of fevers by evacuating medicines, the effects of acids and alkalis in medicine, and the question as to inventors in medicine (he supported the claim that William Harvey had discovered the circulation of the blood, rather than Hippocrates). His championing of this new 'iatromechanical' theory of physiology played a large part in his professorial appointments in Edinburgh and Leiden. He corresponded occasionally with Isaac Newton himself and visited him on his journey to Leiden in 1692.  Writings  Pitcairne was a good classical scholar, and wrote Latin verses, occasionally with something more than mere imitative cleverness and skill. He was the joint author of a comedy, The Assembly, or Scotch Reformation, originally entitled The Phanaticks (1691),First published as \\"by a Scots Gentleman\\", London, 1722; Pitcairne identified as author in 1817 ed. and of a satirical poem Babel, containing witty sketches of prominent Presbyterian divines of the time, whom, as a loudly avowed Jacobite, he strongly disliked.  Beliefs and private life  He was prone to irreverent and ribald jests, and thus gained the reputation of being an unbeliever and an atheist, though he was a professed deist. The stories about his over-indulgence in drink are probably exaggerated. He was repeatedly involved in violent quarrels with his medical brethren and others, and once or twice got into scrapes with the government on account of his indiscreet political utterances. Among his friends, however, he was evidently well liked, and he is known to have acted with great kindness and generosity to deserving men who needed his help. Thomas Ruddiman, the Scottish scholar, for example, was rescued from a life of obscurity by his encouragement and assistance. Mead, too, appears never to have forgotten what he owed to his old teacher at Leiden. When a son of Pitcairne's participated in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and was subsequently condemned to death, he was saved by the earnest interposition of Mead with Sir Robert Walpole. He pleaded, very artfully, that if Walpole's health had been bettered by Mead's skill, or if members of the royal family were preserved by his care, it was owing to the instruction he had received from Dr Pitcairne.  Death and legacy  The Pitcairne vault within the Covenanter's Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard Lorenzo Bellini, Opuscula, 1695, dedicated to Archibald Pitcairne Pitcairne died in Edinburgh on 20 October 1713, aged 60. He had been a great collector of books, and his library, which is said to have been of considerable value, was, through the influence of Ruddiman, sold to Peter the Great of Russia. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard with his wife Elizabeth Stevenson (d.1734) and his daughters.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Caledonian Society of Edinburgh The grave lies in the southern section known as the Covenanters Prison and can be viewed by special arrangement or on an organised tour.

A member of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society, Anderson was a prominent figure in the Scottish Enlightenment. He invented the Scotch plough. Early years Anderson was born at Hermiston, Midlothian and while still young attended lectures on chemistry by William Cullen, at the University of Edinburgh. At the age of 15, after the death of his parents, he took over the working of the family farm. Economic theorist James Anderson, engraving published in the Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine of May 1809 In 1777 Anderson published An Enquiry into the Nature of the Corn Laws, in which he anticipated David Ricardo's theory of rent. Some historians believe Anderson was the root source for Marx's critique of capitalist agriculture. Rent, Anderson argued, was a charge for the use of the more fertile soil. The least fertile soils in cultivation generated an income that simply covered the costs of production, while the more fertile soils received a \\"certain premium for an exclusive privilege to cultivate them; which will be greater or smaller according to the more or less fertility of the soil. It is this premium which constitutes what we now call rent; a medium by means of which the expence () of cultivating soils of very different degrees of fertility may be reduced to a perfect quality.\\" Anderson argued that improvement of the soil was possible; but also that humans could degrade the soil. He argued also that since where farm land in England was held by capitalists, the farmer would tend to avoid improvements the full return for which would not be received during the lease. Marx's critique of capitalist agriculture drew upon Anderson's analysis and he insisted that soil fertility was a historical issue, and that fertility could both improve or decline. The irrationality of capitalist agriculture, he argued, was bound up with the whole antagonism of town and country out of which bourgeois society had arisen.Foster, John Bellamy. (2002) Ecology Against Capitalism, New York: Monthly Review Press Publisher In 1783 he settled in Edinburgh. In 1791 he started a weekly publication called The Bee, which was largely written by himself, and of which 18 volumes were published. In 1797 he began to reside at Isleworth, and from 1799 to 1802 he produced a monthly publication, Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts and Miscellaneous Literature. He was also the author of many pamphlets on agricultural and economical topics, under numerous aliases, including Agricola, Germanicus, and Timothy Hairbrain. One of his first publications was A Practical Treatise on Chimneys (1776). He was a friend of Jeremy Bentham, and involved in the latter's idea of an ideal prison or Panopticon. Anderson also corresponded with George Washington. Inventor The engineer James Green, responsible for the building of some of the first canalboat lifts, credited their invention to Dr James Anderson.The Canals of Southwest England Charles Hadfield Page 104 The Scotch plough or Scots plough (not to be confused with the Scottish hand plough) was a wood and iron, animal draft, primary tillage implement (plough) for use on heavy ground invented in the 19th century by James Anderson. Honorarium In 1780 Anderson received an LLD (honorary doctorate in law) from the University of Aberdeen. He died in West Ham, Essex on 15 October 1808. Family In 1768 Anderson married Margaret Seton (d. 1788), and took over the management of Monkshill farm in Aberdeenshire of . Together had 13 children, one daughter and five sons survived their father; their son, John, was apprenticed to Thomas Bewick. Their daughter, Margaret (1778‚Äì1863), married Benjamin Outram.

His father was Patrick Anderson of Walston, a church minister, who was for some time imprisoned on the Bass Rock on the Firth of Forth in Haddingtonshire. He was educated for the law, and became a writer to the signet (Scottish solicitor or attorney) in 1691. His profession gave him the opportunity of gratifying his taste for the study of ancient documents; and just before the Act of Union 1707 the Parliament of Scotland commissioned him to prepare for publication what remained of the public records of the Kingdom of Scotland, and in their last session voted a sum of ¬£1940 pound Scots to defray his expenses. At this work he laboured for several years with great judgment and perseverance; but it was not completed at his death in 1728. The book was published posthumously in 1739, edited by Thomas Ruddiman, under the title Selectus Diplomatum et Numismatum Scotiae Thesaurus. Ruddiman also produced a translation into Scots. The preparation of this great national work involved the author in considerable pecuniary loss; and soon after his death, the numerous plates, engraved by John Sturt, were sold for ¬£530. These plates are now lost, and the book has become exceedingly scarce. Anderson was appointed in 1715 Postmaster General for Scotland, as some compensation for his labours; but in the political struggles of 1717 he was deprived of this office, and never again obtained any reward for his services. He published, during the controversy about whether Scotland was bound by the Act of Settlement 1701 or not, An Historical Essay showing that the Crown and Kingdom of Scotland is Imperial and Independent (Edinburgh, 1705), and later Collections relating to the History of Mary Queen of Scotland (in 4 vols, Edin., 1727‚Äì1728), both of which were later used extensively by his great- nephew, the historian William Robertson.

Early life  Boccara was born in Casablanca, Morocco, into a Jewish family of Italian origin that lived in Tunisia before they settled in Morocco. When she was 18, she moved from Casablanca to Paris, France, where she eventually started her artistic career as a singer. Boccara also had a brother and a sister in show business, composers Jean-Michel Braque (born Roger Boccara) and Lina Boccara.

","title":"Frida Boccara"},{"id":"1883315","text":"Ian Campbell (26 April 1926 ‚Äì 9 September 2007) was a Scottish politician who served as a backbench Labour Member of Parliament (MP) of the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1987. Early life Campbell was born in Dumbarton, the second of the four children of William Campbell and his wife Helen (n√©e Crockett). He was educated at Knoxland Primary School and Dumbarton Academy, and studied electrical engineering at the Royal College of Science and Technology in Glasgow (now Strathclyde University). After National Service in Germany with the Royal Engineers, he became a chartered engineer, and worked for the South of Scotland Electricity Board from 1948 to 1965. He married Mary Millar in 1950; they had two sons and three daughters. Political career Campbell joined the Labour Party in 1953. He was elected to Dumbarton Burgh Council in 1958 and was first elected as Provost of Dumbarton in 1962. In 1968, was re- elected unopposed for an almost unprecedented third term. The Labour administration in Dumbarton during these years embarked on a significant programme of slum clearance, house building, and town centre redevelopment. The closure of the Denny Shipyard in 1963 was the most significant sign of a shift from heavy industry as the major source of employment in the town requiring a major investment of effort from the council and its leadership in economic development. When Tom Steele, the Labour MP for Dunbartonshire West, indicated that he would stand down at the 1970 general election, Campbell was selected by the Constituency Labour Party as their candidate. He was duly elected, serving as MP for Dunbartonshire West until 1983 and then for the successor seat, Dumbarton, until 1987. He won at five general elections, although his seat was not always particularly safe, particularly in the two general elections of 1974: his majority was reduced to just over 1,800 votes by the Scottish National Party at the October 1974 general election. As a Member of Parliament, his focus was firmly on the interests of his constituency and constituents. Throughout his time in parliament, he took a keen interest in the Scotch whisky industry, which was the key employer in the constituency. The nuclear base at Faslane was also in his constituency, and his constituents were also affected by the decline of the shipbuilding industry on the Lower Clyde. Although a backbencher for all of his time in the Commons, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Bruce Millan, from 1976 until 1979, during the period when the Labour government was proposing to implement Scottish devolution. He also served for many years as a member of the Chairman's panel, and eventually as the regular Chairman of the Scottish Grand Committee. He was significantly, and controversially, involved in the campaign against abortion, co-sponsoring an ultimately unsuccessful private member's bill introduced by his friend and colleague, James White, MP for Glasgow Pollok, to tighten the requirements of the Abortion Act 1967. Campbell acted as an informal whip in the committees considering various bills aimed at tightening the law in this area. Early in the 1979 parliament, he successfully piloted a private member's bill through the House of Commons to enable Scottish local authorities to offer concessionary transport to people with mental disabilities. In the run-up to the 1983 general election, he narrowly won a re-selection battle within his own Constituency Labour Party, against a challenge from a Leo Crawley, later a left-wing councillor in the constituency. In that election he was re-elected for the new Dumbarton constituency, which was practically the same as his old constituency, the only change was the addition of the villages of Bowling, and Milton. He retired at the 1987 general election and was replaced by John McFall. Later life After he retired from Parliament, Campbell he was active as an elder at Riverside Church in Dumbarton. He was also a member of the Dumbarton District Enterprise Trust, a member of the Strathclyde Local Valuation Panel, and a magistrate. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000, and died in Dumbarton. He was survived by his wife and five children.

It is thus a specific form of forced perspective. Description There are hundreds of instances where a hanging miniature has been used. This is a very old device and when produced correctly it is almost completely undetectable. The chariot race in the 1925 version of Ben-Hur is a good example. Only a very careful examination will reveal that above the wall surrounding the stadium and the first rows of bleachers, there hangs a miniature with moving 'puppet' people that can rise and fall with the human extras. Another cost saving effect was that of 'flopping' the negative so that only one side of the stadium miniature was built. The main reason for using a miniature in this way is that, unlike a painting, the light on the built set will always be the same as that on the miniature making it possible to shoot in a variety of different 'lights' during the day.

Located in the northwest of the state, on the northern slope of the Sierra de Patamban, part of the Volcanic Belt, at 1,600 meters altitude. It was founded by Fray Sebasti√°n de Trasierra in 1555, although they are located buildings and paintings of more than 3000 years old. Jacona was the symbolism of life and death, the symbol of humanity, and was one of the first pre-Hispanic peoples entrusted to the Spanish. Place Names Jacona is word with origin in the tecuexes (one of the peoples of the Great Chichimeca, whose home language is Uto-Aztecan). Just as the Spanish transformed the writing of words such as Mexico to Mejico, Xalisco to Jalisco or Xallapan to Jalapa, the word was originally written Xacona. It derives from the original word Xucunan, which tecuexes meant \\"place of flowers and vegetables.\\" Xacona was established in a region chichimeca (tecuexes), bordering the kingdom purepecha (the misnamed \\"Tarasco\\"). This explains why other neighboring towns have names porhepeni. The main hill against Jacona, for example, is called Curutaran. Curutaran is a Purepecha word formed by the words: \\"ku\\" together, \\"rhu\\" projection, tip, \\"tarha\\", play ball, and \\"an\\", gods. Means then: \\"Place where the gods gather to play ball\\".

It is thought about half the population has relatives in Southern California. In the year 2000, the population was 25,778, but estimates can reach as high as 50,000 when seasonal migrant laborers come and stay there.

It was created in May 2019, when the Canadian company Saputo Inc bought out Dairy Crest. Dairy Crest itself was created in 1981, as a spin off of the Milk Marketing Board. Its brands include Saputo Dairy UK, Cathedral City Cheddar cheese, Country Life butter, Utterly Butterly, Vitalite and Clover. Dairy Crest processed and sold milk (wholesale and via doorstep deliveries) and owned the milkshake brand Frijj until the sale of this part of the business to Germany's M√ºller in December 2015. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange as Dairy Crest plc, until it was acquired by Saputo in April 2019. Saputo rebranded the company under its own name later that year. History Dairy Crest was established in 1981, as the milk processing arm of the Milk Marketing Board. In 1983, the company launched Clover, its dairy spread. In 1991, the company established a joint venture with French dairy company, Yoplait, called Yoplait Dairy Crest (often abbreviated to YDC) which is 51% owned by Yoplait and 49% by Dairy Crest and which distributes Yoplait brand products in the United Kingdom. In 1995, it bought the Cathedral City brand of cheese from Mendip Foods Ltd. The business was privatised in August 1996, and Dairy Crest was listed on the London Stock Exchange. Logo as Dairy Crest In July 2000, it acquired the dairy and cheese products division of Unigate in London, and in November 2002, it acquired the St Ivel spreads company which had been based in Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. In September 2004, it acquired the Country Life butter brand from the English Butter Marketing Company. In July 2006, it acquired Express Dairies from Arla Foods for ¬£33m. In October 2006, it sold the majority of its own label cheese business to First Milk, its Scottish equivalent, along with the creameries and factory that produce most of the products concerned. In January 2007, Dairy Crest bought St Hubert for ¬£248 million securing the Cholegram, Le Fleurier, Omega 3and Vall√© brands. Sale of milk business Smith's Elizabethan milk float (2008) In July 2013, Dairy Crest sold its doorstep milk delivery operations in the Northwest of England to Creamline Dairies, who now operate the milk rounds from the depots in Warrington, Flixton, Stockport and Macclesfield, and Mortons, operate all those in Wirral, Chester and Liverpool. On 6 November 2014, Dairy Crest announced a big slump in profits, down 95% to ¬£900,000 in the six months to September. The company agreed the sale of its entire legacy milk business, which processes and distributes milk, as well as the milkshake brand of Frijj, to Germany's M√ºller for ¬£80 million, to be combined with M√ºller's existing subsidiary M√ºller Wiseman Dairies. The sale was approved by the Competition and Markets Authority on 19 October 2015, and the sale was completed on 26 December 2015. Acquisition by Saputo On 22 February 2019, it was announced that Canadian dairy company Saputo Inc would be buying Dairy Crest. The company was valued at ¬£975m, making each share worth 620p. The transaction was completed on 15 April 2019. At the time of the sale, Dairy Crest was the fourth largest dairy company in the United Kingdom, based on turnover. Saputo renamed the business under its own brand in July 2019, though Dairy Crest Limited remained the principal legal entity. Operations The company supplies cheese, spreads and drinks. Cheese brands include Cathedral City, Davidstow Cheddar and Wexford. Spread brands include Clover, Country Life, St Hubert, Utterly Butterly, Vitalite and Willow. Drink brands include Country Life Milk. Spread production is consolidated at Kirkby. Davidstow Creamery in Cornwall has been run by the company since 1981. As of , it produces Cathedral City and Davidstow Cheddar. Crudgington Creamery was closed in May 2014, when production of spreads was concentrated at Kirkby, while its research and development facility was transferred to an innovation centre, built by the company at Harper Adams University. The headline refers to demolition of the premises due to begin 2015. Plans for the creamery to close were first announced in September 2012.

Trinidad, officially La Sant√≠sima Trinidad (), is a city in Bolivia, capital of the department of Beni. The population is 130,000 (2010 official estimate). The city was founded in 1686 by Father Cipriano Barace. In 1769 the town moved to its current location, 9 miles away, due to flooding. The original city was on the Mamor√© River, but flooding and disease forced a move on the location of the city. It is located in the province of Cercado, one of Beni‚Äôs eight provinces. Sited on the southern edge of the Amazon basin on the Llanos de Moxos/Mojos, the climate is hot and humid at all times. One of the more notable features of the city is the open drains that surrounds every block of buildings. These are linked together by lidded ditches and thence to the local river. These are necessary due to the heavy rainfall that occurs between December and May. Trinidad, located in the Bolivian tropics, is hot and humid most of the year. This region of the country is heavily forested and many large rivers (all tributaries of the Amazon river) run through Beni. Like most cities in Bolivia, it is built around a central plaza with a large Catholic cathedral as its centerpiece. Trinidad was originally a small Jesuit town but is now a large city with over 100,000 inhabitants. Its mission-style church was demolished and rebuilt in 1923. Despite these changes, many of the original religious relics, paintings and statues are still housed in the cathedral, which faces the main plaza. The City is surrounded by rivers, lakes and lagoons. There are many river tours and restaurants and resorts around the city‚Äôs main lagoons. Trinidad is also one of the first five Jesuit mission towns established and these are now part of the Misiones tour includes visits to San Javier, Loreto, San Pedro and San Ignacio de Moxos as well. Trinidad and San Ignacio de Moxos both take part in the International Baroque Music Festival every two years in Bolivia. It is also home to Bolivian Navy flotilla.  Climate  Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Trinidad has a tropical monsoon climate with a lengthy rainy season and a short dry season.  What to see  Trinidad has two singular museums. The Museo It√≠cola (Fish Fauna Museum) is the third largest of its kind in South America and houses over 400 specimens of fish species found in the region‚Äôs lakes and lagoons. It is located on the UAB University campus and is truly interesting. Here you can see tiny fish, piranhas, and a preserved pink river dolphin (full sized floating in formaldehyde). The Kenneth Lee Ethno-Archeological Museum is also a great place to visit. Here you can see exhibits of pottery, utensils and tools, textiles and other implements used by the Moxos culture. Of interest to ornithologists, the highly endangered blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis) in the surrounding countryside. Expeditions to see these can be locally arranged.

It is similar to computer-assisted telephone interviewing, except that the interview takes place in person instead of over the telephone. This method is usually preferred over a telephone interview when the questionnaire is long and complex. It has been classified as a personal interviewing technique because an interviewer is usually present to serve as a host and to guide the respondent. If no interviewer is present, the term Computer-Assisted Self Interviewing (CASI) may be used. An example of a situation in which CAPI is used as the method of data collection is the British Crime Survey. Characteristics of this interviewing technique are: * Either the respondent or an interviewer operates a device (this could be a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone) and answers a questionnaire. * The questionnaire is an application that takes the respondent through a set of questions using a pre-designed route based on answers given by the respondent. * Help screens and courteous error messages are provided. * Colorful screens and on and off-screen stimuli can add to the respondent's interest and involvement in the task. * This approach is used in shopping malls, preceded by the intercept and screening process. * CAPI is also used to interview households, using sampling techniques like random walk to get a fair representation of the area that needs to be interviewed. * It is also used to conduct business-to-business research at trade shows or conventions. Advantages CAPI * The face-to-face setting allows the interviewer to capture verbal and non-verbal feedback. * Personal interviewing allows for interviews of longer duration. Interviews of 45 minutes or more are not uncommon. * Modern devices can record audio feedback from respondent, track GPS location and allows pictures to be taken of the interview, thus adding to the quality of the data. * There is no need to transcribe the results into a computer form. The computer program can be constructed so as to place the results directly in a format that can be read by statistical analysis programs such as PSPP or DAP. * The presence of an interviewer helps when probing for spontaneous awareness of certain topics. * The interviewer can verify that the respondent answering the questions is the person that needs to be interviewed. Disadvantages CAPI * It is a relatively expensive means of interviewing. * In comparison to web interviewing it can be more time consuming to gather data. Computer-Assisted Self Interviewing (CASI) The big difference between a computer-assisted self interview (CASI) and a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) is that in the latter an interviewer is present, but not in the former. There are two kinds of computer-assisted self interviewing: a \\"video-CASI\\" and an \\"audio- CASI\\". Both types of computer-assisted self interviewing might have a big advantage over computer-assisted personal interviewing, because subjects could be more inclined to answer sensitive questions. The reason for this is that they feel that a CASI is more private due to the absence of an interviewer. Advantages CASI This form of interview is substantially cheaper when a large number of respondents is required, because: * There is no need to recruit or pay interviewers. Respondents are able to fill in the questionnaires themselves. * The program can be placed on a web site, potentially attracting a worldwide audience. Disadvantages CASI * The survey is likely to attract only respondents who are \\"computer savvy\\", thus introducing potential bias to the survey. * The survey can miss feedback and clarification/quality control that a personal interviewer could provide. For example, a question that should be interpreted in a particular way, but could also be interpreted differently, can raise questions for respondents. If no interviewer is present, these questions will not be answered, potentially causing bias in the results of the questionnaire. Video-CASI Video-CASI are often used to make a complex questionnaire more understandable for the person that is being interviewed. With video-CASI, respondents read questions as they appear on the screen and enter their answers with the keyboard (or some other input device). The computer takes care of the \\"housekeeping\\" or administrative tasks for the respondent. The advantages of video-CASI are automated control of complex question routing, the ability to tailor questions based on previous responses, real-time control of out-of-range and inconsistent responses, and the general standardization of the interview. Video-CASI possesses significant disadvantages, however. Most obviously, video-CASI demands that the respondent can read with some facility. A second, more subtle disadvantage is that, at least with the character-based displays of many video-CASI applications of today, the visual and reading burden imposed on the respondent appears to be much greater than with an attractively designed paper form. The size of the characters and other qualities of the computer user interface seem to demand more reading and computer screen experience than that possessed by many who might be competent readers of printed material. Graphical user interfaces (GUI) may reduce or eliminate this problem, but the present software used to developed video-CASI applications usually lacks this feature. Audio-CASI Audio-CASI (sometimes called Telephone-CASI) asks respondents questions in an auditory fashion. Audio-CASI has the same advantage as Video-CASI in that it can make a complex questionnaire more understandable for the person that is being interviewed. It provides privacy (or anonymity) of response equivalent to that of paper self- administered questionnaires (SAQs). In contrast to Video-CASI, Audio-CASI proffers these potential advantages without limiting data collection to the literate segment of the population. By adding simultaneous audio renditions of each question and instruction aloud, audio-CASI can remove the literacy barriers to self-administration of either Video-CASI or SAQ. In audio-CASI, an audio box is attached to the computer; respondents put on headphones and listen to the question and answer choices as they are displayed on the screen. Respondents have the option of turning off the screen so that people coming into the room cannot read the questions, turning off the sound if they can read faster than the questions are spoken, or keeping both the sound and video on as they answer the questions. Respondents can enter a response at any time and move to the next question without waiting for completion of the audio question and answer choices for a question. The advantages of audio-CASI, then, are that the addition of audio makes CASI fully applicable to a very wide range of respondents. Persons with limited or no reading abilities are able to listen, understand, and respond to the full content of the survey instrument. Observers of audio-CASI interviews also often report that even with seemingly strong readers, audio-CASI interviews seem to more effectively and fully capture respondents‚Äô concentration. This may be because wearing headphones increases the insulation of the respondent for external stimuli, and also may be explained by the fact that the recorded human voice in the audio component evokes a more personalized interaction between the respondent and the instrument. Research on computer-assisted interviewing Computer- assisted interviewing methods such as CAPI, CATI, or CASI, have been the focus of systematic reviews on the effects of computer-assisted interviewing on data quality. Those reviews indicate that computer-assisted methods are accepted by both interviewers and respondents, and these methods tend to improve data quality. : Waterton and Duffy (1984) compared reports of alcohol consumption under CASI and personal interviews. Overall, reports of alcohol consumption were 30 percent higher under the CASI procedure, and reports of liquor consumption were 58 percent higher. In a study that compared Audio-CASI with paper SAQs and Video-CASI, researchers showed that both Audio- and Video-CASI systems work well even with subjects who do not have extensive familiarity with computers. Indeed, respondents preferred the Audio- and Video-CASI to paper SAQs. The computerized systems also eliminated errors in execution of ‚Äúskip‚Äù instructions that occurred when subjects completed paper SAQs. In a number of instances, the computerized systems also appeared to encourage more complete reporting of sensitive behaviors such as use of illicit drugs. Among the two CASI systems, respondents rated Audio-CASI more favorably than Video- CASI in terms of interest, ease of use, and overall preference.

A channel in this context is the grayscale image of the same size as a color image, made of just one of these primary colors. For instance, an image from a standard digital camera will have a red, green and blue channel. A grayscale image has just one channel. In geographic information systems, channels are often referred to as raster bands. Another closely related concept is feature maps, which are used in convolutional neural networks. Overview In the digital realm, there can be any number of conventional primary colors making up an image; a channel in this case is extended to be the grayscale image based on any such conventional primary color. By extension, a channel is any grayscale image of the same dimension as and associated with the original image. Channel is a conventional term used to refer to a certain component of an image. In reality, any image format can use any algorithm internally to store images. For instance, GIF images actually refer to the color in each pixel by an index number, which refers to a table where three color components are stored. However, regardless of how a specific format stores the images, discrete color channels can always be determined, as long as a final color image can be rendered. The concept of channels is extended beyond the visible spectrum in multispectral and hyperspectral imaging. In that context, each channel corresponds to a range of wavelengths and contains spectroscopic information. The channels can have multiple widths and ranges. Three main channel types (or color models) exist, and have respective strengths and weaknesses. RGB images An RGB image has three channels: red, green, and blue. RGB channels roughly follow the color receptors in the human eye, and are used in computer displays and image scanners. If the RGB image is 24-bit (the industry standard as of 2005), each channel has 8 bits, for red, green, and blue‚Äîin other words, the image is composed of three images (one for each channel), where each image can store discrete pixels with conventional brightness intensities between 0 and 255. If the RGB image is 48-bit (very high color-depth), each channel is made of 16-bit images. =RGB color sample= Image:Channel digital image RGB color.jpgA 24-bit RGB image Image:Channel digital image red.jpgThe red channel, displayed as grayscale Image:Channel digital image green.jpgThe green channel, displayed as grayscale Image:Channel digital image blue.jpgThe blue channel, displayed as grayscale Notice how the grey trees have similar brightness in all channels, the red dress is much brighter in the red channel than in the other two, and how the green part of the picture is shown much brighter in the green channel. YUV YUV images are an affine transformation of the RGB colorspace, originated in broadcasting. The Y channel correlates approximately with perceived intensity, whilst the U and V channels provide colour information. CMYK A CMYK image has four channels: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). CMYK is the standard for print, where subtractive coloring is used. A 32-bit CMYK image (the industry standard as of 2005) is made of four 8-bit channels, one for cyan, one for magenta, one for yellow, and one for key color (typically is black). 64-bit storage for CMYK images (16-bit per channel) is not common, since CMYK is usually device-dependent, whereas RGB is the generic standard for device- independent storage. =CMYK color sample= Image:Channel digital image RGB color.jpgExample 32-bit CMYK image Image:Channel digital image cyan.jpgCyan channel Image:Channel digital image magenta.jpgMagenta channel Image:Channel digital image yellow.jpgYellow channel Image:Channel digital image black.jpgKey (black) channel HSV HSV, or hue saturation value, stores color information in three channels, just like RGB, but one channel is devoted to brightness (value), and the other two convey colour information. The value channel is similar to (but not exactly the same as) the CMYK black channel, or its negative. HSV is especially useful in lossy video compression, where loss of color information is less noticeable to the human eye. Alpha channel The alpha channel stores transparency information‚Äîthe higher the value, the more opaque that pixel is. No camera or scanner measures transparency, although physical objects certainly can possess transparency, but the alpha channel is extremely useful for compositing digital images together. Bluescreen technology involves filming actors in front of a primary color background, then setting that color to transparent, and compositing it with a background. The GIF and PNG image formats use alpha channels on the World Wide Web to merge images on web pages so that they appear to have an arbitrary shape even on a non-uniform background. Other channels In 3D computer graphics, multiple channels are used for additional control over material rendering; e.g., controlling specularity and so on. Bit depth In digitizing images, the color channels are converted to numbers. Since images contain thousands of pixels, each with multiple channels, channels are usually encoded in as few bits as possible. Typical values are 8 bits per channel or 16 bits per channel. Indexed color effectively gets rid of channels altogether to get, for instance, 3 channels into 8 bits (GIF) or 16 bits. Optimized channel sizes Since the brain doesn't necessarily perceive distinctions in each channel to the same degree as in other channels, it is possible that differing the number of bits allocated to each channel will result in more optimal storage; in particular, for RGB images, compressing the blue channel the most and the red channel the least may be better than giving equal space to each. This type of \\"preferential\\" compression is the result of studies which show that the human retina actually uses the red channel to distinguish detail, along with the green channel in a lesser measure, and uses the blue channel for background or environmental information. Among other techniques, lossy video compression uses chroma subsampling to reduce the bit depth in color channels (hue and saturation), while keeping all brightness information (value in HSV). 16-bit HiColor stores red and blue in 5 bits, and green in 6 bits.

The Duca della Repubblica Fiorentina, rendered in English as Duke of the Florentine Republic or Duke of the Republic of Florence, was a title created in 1532 by Pope Clement VII for the Medici family (his own family), which ruled the Republic of Florence. There were effectively only two dukes of the Republic of Florence, Alessandro de' Medici and Cosimo de' Medici, the second duke being elevated to Grand Duke of Tuscany, causing the Florentine title to become subordinate to the greater Tuscan title.Strathern, Paul. The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance. Vintage Publishers: London. History heraldic achievement of the Medici, the family to which the two Dukes of the Florentine Republic belonged. In 1532, Pope Clement VII, who was born Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, appointed Alessandro de' Medici as duke over the Republic of Florence, the Medici family having acted as de facto rulers over the city of Florence since 1434 when Cosimo \\"the Elder\\" de' Medici (also known by his supporters as Pater Patriae, or \\"Father of the Country\\"), returned to the city from his short-lived exile in the Republic of Venice by the Alberti and Strozzi families who were also political rivals of the Medici family. The duchy would bolster Medici power and influence in the region, which had just a few years prior been restored by Emperor Charles V after political upheaval against the Medici pope and Medici rulers of Florence in 1527. Alessandro is also believed by historians to have been the illegitimate son of either Pope Clement VII or Lorenzo II de' Medici, Duke of Urbino. In 1535, a delegation of Florentine nobles, which included the Pazzi family who previously conspired to assassinate Lorenzo de' Medici and was headed by Alessandro‚Äôs cousin Ippolito de' Medici, sought to gain the assistance of Emperor Charles V to depose Alessandro. Charles rejected the delegations‚Äô appeals, as Alessandro had been wedded to the emperor's daughter Margaret of Parma. Alessandro ruled as duke less than four years, being assassinated by Lorenzino de' Medici on 6 January 1537. With no legitimate issue, Cosimo de' Medici was chosen to succeed his distant relative by Florentine officials. Cosimo completely overhauled the bureaucracy and administration of Florence, and, in 1542, the Imperial Armed Forces stationed in Florence by Charles V were withdrawn. On 17 April 1555, Florentine and Spanish forces occupied the Republic of Siena after a brief conflict. Philip II of Spain bestowed the territory on Cosimo as a hereditary fiefdom in July 1557. In 1548, Cosimo purchased Elba from the Republic of Genoa and based his new developing navy there. Cosimo founded the port city of Livorno and allowed the city‚Äôs inhabitants to enjoy freedom of religion. The ducal family moved into the Palazzo Pitti in 1560. Cosimo commissioned the architect Vasari to build the Uffizi as offices for the Medici bank. Finally, Cosimo was elevated to The Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1569 by Pope Pius V. This effectively ended the Duchy of Florence, which became subordinate to the more elevated grand ducal title. The Medici continued to rule over Florence and Tuscany until their extinction in 1737 after the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici, who had no children.

SIAM is the world's largest professional association devoted to applied mathematics, and roughly two-thirds of its membership resides within the United States. Founded in 1951, the organization began holding annual national meetings in 1954, and now hosts conferences, publishes books and scholarly journals, and engages in lobbying in issues of interest to its membership. The focus for the society is applied, computational, and industrial mathematics, and the society often promotes its acronym as \\"Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics\\". Members include engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, both those employed in academia and those working in industry. The society supports educational institutions promoting applied mathematics. SIAM is one of the four member organizations of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics. Membership Membership is open to both individuals and organizations. By the end of its first full year of operation, SIAM had 130 members; by 1968, it had 3,700. Student members can join SIAM chapters affiliated and run by students and faculty at universities. Most universities with SIAM chapters are in the United States (including Harvard and MIT), but SIAM chapters also exist in other countries, for example at Oxford, at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne and at Peking University. SIAM publishes the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online, a venue for undergraduate research in applied and computational mathematics. (SIAM also offers the SIAM Visiting Lecture Program, which helps arrange visits from industrial mathematicians to speak to student groups about applied mathematics and their own professional experiences.) In 2009, SIAM instituted a Fellows program to recognize certain members who have made outstanding contributions to the fields that SIAM serves.  Activity groups  The society includes a number of activity groups (SIAGs) to allow for more focused group discussions and collaborations. Activity groups organize domain-specific conferences and minisymposia, and award prizes. Unlike special interest groups in similar academic associations like ACM, activity groups are chartered for a fixed period of time, typically for two years, and require submitting a petition to the SIAM Council and Board for renewal. Charter approval is largely based on group size, as topics that were considered hot at one time may have fewer active researchers later.

All inductees were either born in the Greater St. Louis area or spent their formative or creative years there. Contribution can be in any area; most of the current inductees made their achievements in acting, entertainment, music, sports, art/architecture, broadcasting, journalism, science/education and literature. , the walk has more than 150 brass stars and bronze plaques, each bearing an inscription of an inductee's name and a summary of his or her accomplishments. The stars and plaques are set into the sidewalks along a stretch of Delmar Boulevard in the Delmar Loop area, spanning the border between St. Louis and University City. History The walk was founded by developer Joe Edwards, owner of Blueberry Hill pub/restaurant and other establishments located along the walk. Its first stars and plaques were installed in 1989; the inductees that year were musician Chuck Berry, dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham, bridge builder James B. Eads, poet T. S. Eliot, ragtime composer Scott Joplin, aviator Charles Lindbergh, baseball player Stan Musial, actor Vincent Price, newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and playwright Tennessee Williams. . ExploreStLouis.com. Ten more were selected for each of the next four years (in order to get the walk established), but starting in 1994 no more than three have been awarded in any year. In May 2008, Cedric the Entertainer received the first star and plaque located in the City of St. Louis portion of the loop. The walk (and the boundaries of the Delmar Loop in general) has been expanded eastward by Edwards in recent years as Edwards continues to invest in the area's redevelopment. Selection process Anyone can submit a nomination by mail by supplying basic identification information as well as a description of the nominee's accomplishments and connection to St. Louis. About 30 to 40 finalists are culled from the nominees by the walk's founder and director; the finalists are sent to a selection committee of 120 St. Louisans. The selection committee has been variously described as: * \\"the chancellors of all area universities, key people from local libraries, arts organizations and historical societies, media journalists, and other citizens with an informed understanding of St. Louis' cultural heritage;\\" or * \\"university chancellors, previous inductees and representatives of arts organizations, historical societies and libraries.\\" Prior to 2007, the open-air induction ceremony was held regularly on the third week of May; since then, it is held on a less regular basis, subject to the availability of those being inducted. Some of the walk's inductees, including Dick Gregory, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and Ozzie Smith, are also in the nearby, unrelated Gateway Classic Hall of Fame.

Pharmacology  Phendimetrazine functions as a prodrug to phenmetrazine; approximately 30 percent of an oral dose is converted into it. Phendimetrazine can essentially be thought of as an extended-release formulation of phenmetrazine with less potential for abuse. Phendimetrazine is an anorectic drug which acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). As an amphetamine congener, its structure incorporates the backbone of methamphetamine, a potent CNS stimulant. While the addition of an N-methyl group to amphetamine significantly increases its potency and bioavailability, methylation of phenmetrazine renders the compound virtually inactive. However, phendimetrazine is a prodrug for phenmetrazine which acts as the active metabolite. Phendimetrazine possesses preferable pharmacokinetics over phenmetrazine as a therapeutic agent because its metabolization by demethylases produces a more steady and prolonged exposure of active drug within the body. This decreases abuse potential as the peak blood- concentration of active phenmetrazine that's produced from a single dose of phendimetrazine is lower than a single therapeutically equivalent dose of phenmetrazine. Indicated as a short-term secondary treatment for exogenous obesity, phendimetrazine immediate-release 35mg tablets are typically consumed one hour before meals, not to exceed three doses daily. Phendimetrazine is also manufactured as a 105mg extended-release capsule for once daily dosing, typically consumed 30 to 60 minutes before a morning meal. Whereas the immediate-release formulation has a maximum daily dosage of 210mg (6 tablets), the extended-release capsules have a maximum daily dosage of 105mg (one capsule).  Legality  According to the List of Psychotropic Substances under International Control published by the International Narcotics Control Board, phendimetrazine is a Schedule III controlled substance under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.List of psychotropic substances under international control  See also  left * 2-Phenyl-3,6-dimethylmorpholine * 3-Fluorophenmetrazine * Fenbutrazate * G-130 * Morazone * Manifaxine * Radafaxine * Phenmetrazine * Fenmetramide  References  Category:Antiobesity drugs Category:Anorectics Category:Morpholines Category:Euphoriants Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents ","title":"Phendimetrazine"},{"id":"1883401","text":"Jiquilpan de Ju√°rez is a town of about 15,000 residents in northwest Michoac√°n, Mexico, near the border with the states of Colima and Jalisco.

The National Map, accessed April 15, 2011 stream located in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. It is a significant tributary of the Chattahoochee River. It was known as Soap Creek during the 19th century. A section of Sope Creek runs through the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. The Sope Creek Ruins are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Sope Creek starts within the city of Marietta proper, on the west side of Interstate 75, on the northeastern portion of State Route 120 Alternate (former northern half of State Route 120 Loop, now known as North Marietta Parkway. The creek begins as a spring, first evident emerging out of a culvert under Sessions Street, where it trickles southward and serves as the rear property line for the historic homes on lots facing Church Street (to the west), and Cherokee Street (to the east). The creek then travels in a culvert under the intersection of Cherokee Street and North Marietta Parkway, then under the parking lot of the Police Department/Cobb 911 Center at the southeast corner of the intersection. Thereafter, the creek travels east, parallel with SR 120 Alt., turning southeast around the same point as the road. It then separates from road, continuing southeast, as the road bends south. It crosses Roswell Road (the main Georgia 120), and travels in a sidewinder fashion to the east for the next . Along the way, Sewell Mill Creek and Bishop Creek empty into Sope Creek. At this point, the creek turns south-southeast and crosses Lower Roswell Road. It travels in this direction for the next , crossing Paper Mill Road and Columns Drive, before emptying into the Chattahoochee River. From beginning to end, Sope Creek falls nearly over the course of approximately . In the last two miles, Sope Creek cuts through the palisades that formed on both sides of the Chattahoochee, forming a small gorge based around the creek. The most important feature of the creek is its name recognition. With one exception, Sope Creek is usually not treated as a major entity until the last two miles. The exception is an apartment complex close to the crossing of Roswell Road, near the mark. Near the end of the creek, the name of Sope Creek has more appeal to the public, and therefore, it is seen in names, such as Sope Creek Elementary School, Sope Creek Nature Trails, and Sope Creek Homes. Stream gauges The stream gauge on Sope Creek (MARG1) is mounted to the south side of the Lower Roswell Road bridge, at (NAD83). This is above sea level (NGVD29), and receives flow from a drainage area of . The gauge on Sewell Mill Creek (SMCG1) is located at Roswell Road (Georgia 120) at (NAD27), where it has an area of , and an elevation of above sea level (NGVD29). The old covered bridge Paper Mill Road crosses the creek about one mile upstream from the point where the Sope empties into the Chattahoochee. Paper Mill Road has to wind down the gorge in order to cross over the creek. At the crossing, circa 1960, lay one of Cobb County's two remaining covered bridges; the other crossed Nickajack Creek near Smyrna. The Sope Creek Bridge was a state- declared historic structure and only had a weight capacity of 2000 pounds (one U.S. ton). In 1963, a grossly overweight truck crossed the bridge and damaged the support structure. That summer, the structure was reinforced with steel shanks. On March 29, 1964, the covered bridge burned to the ground, leaving behind only the steel shanks and masonry. Arson was suspected, as the Nickajack Covered Bridge (now known as Concord Covered Bridge) had been partially burned only a few weeks prior. The Paper Mill Road bridge was reconstructed in 1970 and the entire structure was replaced with an improved, widened bridge with sidewalks in 2013. False etymology The origin of the creek's name is not documented. A false etymology has evolved. There are conflicting authorities supporting at least two versions: Soap The Atlanta Journal once said of the area, \\"Sope Creek, particularly in the springtime, is a place of unusual beauty. A quaint old covered bridge spans the stream just below where the log dam used to be. The stream is strewn with great boulders and the water dashes over these in a series of cascades, causing such masses of foam that they look like soapsuds.\\" There are also 19th century references to Soap Creek, which may simply be misspellings of Sope. Old Sope The National Park Service lends some authority to a separate version of the name's origin. In an older brochure, the Park Service stated that the creek is named for \\"...a Cherokee Indian called \\"Old Sope\\" who lived in the area perhaps even after the Removal.\\" A more recent Park Service brochure has reduced that statement to \\"Named for a Cherokee holdout from the Trail of Tears...\\" No further authority or evidence is cited. There are conflicting records indicating that \\"Old Sope\\" may have lived on a different stream in a different part of Georgia. A 2012 statement in the Atlanta Journal favors the Park Service version, except that the Cherokee Indian's name is Soap and he did not live in the area after the Trail of Tears: > The name isn't misspelled; there's just an old and new way of spelling it. > There's an interesting history behind Soap (or Sope) Creek, a tributary of > the Chattahoochee River that has lent its name to housing developments and > buildings in east Cobb County, including an elementary school.

Sope Creek ruins * Sope Creek Ruins Located at the intersection of Paper Mill Road and Sope Creek are old industrial ruins. These ruins are the remnants of a larger manufacturing complex which drew on the waterpower that the creek produced. During the period 1850 to 1940, a succession of enterprises, from a (fully integrated) paper mill, twine plant, flour mill and hydroelectric power plant occupied an area of about one mile along the creek. The paper mill at Sope Creek was run by Marietta Paper Mills and incorporated on December 19, 1859, possibly by Andrew Schofield Edmondston and Saxon A. Anderson. Facilities at the paper mill included a mill, oil room, office, mill sluice (raceway), storeroom, dam, machine shop, pulp-grinding mill, and two shelters. The ruins were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  Ferry at Sope Creek  In 1851, James Isom founded a ferry that crossed the Chattahoochee at the mouth of Sope Creek, and came to own a great deal of land and three slaves, and to be considered wealthy. He died in 1866, and his son-in-law John Heard took over the operations, running the ferry as Heard's Ferry until 1890. Civil War history During Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, troops first crossed the Chattahoochee at Sope Creek. On May 4, 1864, Major-General William T. Sherman took control of the Military Division of the Mississippi and began to engage Confederate General Joseph Johnston and his Army of Tennessee. From the beginning, Johnston was persistent in his effort to fight a defensive battle, rather than offensive. Rightly so, as Sherman had a two-to-one advantage on Johnston. Additionally, Johnston claimed he was waiting for the right opportunity when Sherman would leave himself exposed. Sherman, unwilling to charge headlong against Johnston, decided to outmaneuver Johnston. Thus, every time Johnston found a superior defensive position, Sherman would maneuver around Johnston, forcing Johnston to retreat to a tactically superior position. The two engaged in this 'dance' for nearly two months, with one exception, the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, in which Sherman lost his nerve, attacked head on, and suffered a bloody defeat. Author David Conyngham best described it in his book Sherman's March Through the South, when he wrote \\"True, such movements would not break up Johnston's Army, but it gave us a victory; besides, Sherman and Johnston were watching each other's movements, like two expert wrestlers, to know who would make a slip, for they knew that to attack an intrenched [sic] position was likely to prove a defeat.\\" Even though this was the strategically sound theory, this was a personal gamble for Johnston, for every time he retreated, despite the fact that he was outmanned by Sherman, he aggravated Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Sherman's troops were divided into three armies. These were the Army of the Cumberland, the Army of the Ohio, and the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Major Generals George H. Thomas, John M. Schofield, and James B. McPherson, respectively. Johnston was waiting for one of these three armies to be exposed. While they all moved together, they were in fact, three separate units. The largest body of water between Chattanooga, where Sherman started, and Atlanta, was the Chattahoochee River. If there was any time in which the one portion of the Army of the Mississippi could become separated, and therefore vulnerable, crossing the Chattahoochee was it. As the Union Army approached the Chattahoochee, they moved in from the west and took up positions at Vinings Station. Johnston held the bridgehead on the west side of the river, and had a majority of his troops just across the railroad bridge. On the night of July 7, Sherman gave orders to Schofield to move his troops around and to the left, bypassing Johnston. Sherman had given Schofield orders to find a location between Roswell and Sope Creek in which to ford the Chattahoochee. Sherman said, \\"I wish you to make an examination thereabouts and secure a foothold, fortified on the other side, anywhere about Roswell or mouth of Soap Creek. I also know that Johnston's cavalry has moved to the south flank. It is important to do this at once, for the fords are very important to us.\\" Schofield located a ford on the Chattahoochee one half mile upstream of the mouth of Sope Creek. East Palisades near mouth of Sope Creek. Site of the Union crossing He then sent to Sherman the following: > I have not been able to reconnoiter as far as Roswell to-day. I find a > pretty good crossing near mouth of Soap Creek. Half a mile above the creek > is a shallow ford where infantry can cross easily, but there is no road > leading to it and it would be difficult to make one. Isham's [sic] Ferry > just below mouth of the creek is a good place for a bridge. About 400 yards > from the river on east side is a commanding ridge very favorable for a > bridge-head.

I propose to move > at daylight and cross the river with as little delay as possible, and > believe there is very little chance of failure, no matter which point you > select. Sherman decided that McPherson would hold his position across from Johnston, and at the last moment, swing around in the same fashion as Schofield and cross the Chattahoochee at Shallow Ford, what is today known as Shallowford Road. Sherman wrote to Schofield saying: You may move to the neighborhood of the mouth of Soap Creek. Mask well your command and make a lodgment across the Chattahoochee, but do not attempt it until you have a ford nearby by which to reinforce the party first sent, or by which it may be necessary to retire. We can, after lodgement [sic], make roads to the crossing and may add pontoon bridges, of which we have enough for four bridges. After securing a point opposite Soap Creek, Roswell will follow as a matter of course, and will be additional. The moment I hear that General Garrard has made a lodgment at Roswell, I will send a division of General McPherson to hold fast all he makes. With Roswell and mouth of Soap Creek, we have plenty of room, with Marietta as the depot. I will go down to General McPherson's and stir them up in the morning by way of diversion. Schofield advanced a division across the river at the ford and instructed them to take up positions opposite of the mouth of Sope Creek. There, they would support bridge-building operations and provide cover while the engineers constructed a pontoon bridge at Isom's Ferry. For nearly thirty-six hours, Schofield's troops were isolated on the other side of the Chattahoochee. Even at the end of that time, when McPherson was on the east bank of the river, he was still miles away from Schofield in Roswell. The opportunity for a counter-offensive that Johnston had been waiting for the previous two months presented itself in those thirty-six hours. Instead of a counter-offensive, Johnston was caught complete by surprise and therefore out of position. The majority of his forces were still in defensive positions at Vinings Station on the east side of the Chattahoochee. Schofield reported to Sherman: > I have a division (General Cox's) [Author's note: General Cox's 23rd Army > Corps consisted of four divisions, at the time of this letter, only one was > known to be across the river at this place). It has a good position, and is > rapidly intrenching [sic]. Colonel Buell has laid one bridge and will have > another across to-night. I spent most of the day in reconnoitering and > perfecting arrangements to make success sure. All was done so quietly that > they enemy was taken entirely by surprise, so that when my artillery and > infantry opened from the west bank the enemy fled, leaving a piece of > artillery, which fell into our hands.

The enemy used his > artillery upon our officers while reconnoitering during the day, but when we > opened upon them they fired but a single shot and fled. I presume they were > Brown's militia. We have gained the desired point, captured one piece of > artillery and nobody hurt. I will give you information concerning roads, > etc., beyond the river as soon as possible. By 8:30p.m. on the night of July 8, Schofield had laid a bridge crossing the Chattahoochee at Isom's Ferry and had relocated four divisions to the east bank. Fearing a flanking maneuver by Sherman, Johnston had no alternative but to abandon the west side of the river. He withdrew into Atlanta, burning the railroad bridge behind him. It was after this debacle that Jefferson Davis decided to replace Johnston with General John B. Hood. ReferencesBibliography *Conyngham, David Power. Sherman's March Through the South. Horace W.

There were no photographs taken on the 1869 expedition. The Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869, led by American naturalist John Wesley Powell, was the first thorough cartographic and scientific investigation of long segments of the Green and Colorado rivers in the southwestern United States, including the first recorded passage of white men through the entirety of the Grand Canyon. The expedition, which lasted approximately three months during the summer of 1869, embarked from Green River Station, Wyoming Territory and traveled downstream through parts of the present-day states of Colorado, Utah, and Arizona before reaching the confluence of the Colorado and Virgin rivers in present-day Nevada. Despite a series of hardships, including losses of boats and supplies, near-drownings, and the eventual departures of several crew members, the voyage produced the first detailed descriptions of much of the previously unexplored canyon country of the Colorado Plateau. Powell retraced part of the 1869 route on a second expedition in the winter of 1871‚Äì72. In 1875, he published a classic account of the first expedition (interspersed with elements from the second) called Report on the Exploration of the Colorado River of the West and Its Tributaries, which was revised and reissued in 1895 as The Exploration of the Colorado River and Its Canyons. Expedition=Background Powell had spent much of his youth rafting the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Upper Midwest. A Union major during the American Civil War, he lost his right arm to amputation in 1862 after he was hit by an unspent minie ball at the Battle of Shiloh. Prior to coming west, Powell had been a professor of geology at the Illinois State Normal School and a curator of the Illinois Museum of Natural History. The expedition set out from Green River Station (now Green River, Wyoming) on May 24, 1869, with a company of ten men including Powell. Green River Station's convenient location on the Transcontinental Railroad, which had been completed in Utah Territory just two weeks earlier, allowed Powell to ship the expedition's four boats directly from Chicago to the launching point. The company included Powell's brother Walter, as well as a group of seasoned mountain men and war veterans that Powell had recruited on his way to Wyoming. The complete roster included: * John Wesley Powell (leader of trip) * Walter H. Powell, a captain in the Civil War and John's brother * John C. Sumner, a professional guide and outfitter who had guided Powell, his wife, and his students through the Rocky Mountains on previous trips to the West * Oramel G. Howland, a printer, editor, and hunter * Seneca Howland, a mountain man and Oramel's brother * William H. Dunn, a hunter and trapper from Colorado * William \\"Billy\\" Robert Wesley Hawkins, a mountain man, possible ex-fugitive, and the expedition's cook * Frank Goodman, an Englishman and skilled boat handler who had come west looking for adventure * Andrew Hall, a 19-year-old mule driver whose skills as an oarsman impressed Powell * George Y. Bradley, a soldier at Fort Bridger who agreed to accompany Powell in exchange for a discharge from the United States Army that Powell arranged All of the expedition members had considerable wilderness know-how, and seven were veterans of the Civil War, all of whom had fought for the Union. None of them, however, had any significant whitewater experience on the rivers of the West. Only four of the men were paid for their participation; three at a wage of $25 per man per month for making maps and using scientific instruments, and Billy Hawkins at $1.50 per day for his services as camp cook. Powell purchased four modified, round-bottomed Whitehall rowboats for the expedition. The three \\"freight boats\\" - the Maid of the Ca√±on, the Kitty Clyde's Sister, and the No Name - were identical in design: twenty-one feet long and four feet wide, built of sturdy but heavy oak, with a decked-over bulkhead at each end for storage space. Nearly seven thousand pounds of food and supplies, enough to last ten months, were divided equally between these three boats. The fourth boat, the Emma Dean, was smaller and lighter, only sixteen feet long and built of pine. This was Powell's personal boat, and was rigged with a strap that Powell could clutch with his left hand to keep his balance while standing on deck. Each boat would be rowed by two oarsmen, with only Powell and Oramel Howland, the expedition's official mapmaker, excused from rowing duties. Journey Early on the Green River, the Powell Expedition lost one of their large freight boats, the No Name, at a rapids they named Disaster Falls, washing up on Disaster Island. No one was killed, but many crucial supplies were lost, including all of the expedition's barometers. Powell and his men managed to recover some of the barometers - they were the only means Powell had at his disposal to determine altitude. Knowing the altitude was essential for producing good maps, and it allowed Powell to estimate how much vertical drop remained before the journey's endpoint, which had a known elevation. The Powell expedition named many of the landmarks and geological features along the Green and Colorado rivers, including the Flaming Gorge, the Gates of Lodore (in what is now Dinosaur National Monument), and Glen Canyon. Of the ten men that started out from Green River Station, six completed the entire journey. Frank Goodman left the expedition on July 6 during the resupply at the Uinta River Indian Agency, claiming he'd had more than enough adventure. He walked away and lived for some years with the Paiutes of eastern Utah. Eventually, he settled in Vernal, Utah, where he married and raised a family. The other three adventurers to leave the expedition fared worse. On August 28, just two days from the expedition's intended destination at the mouth of the Virgin River, Oramel Howland, his brother Seneca, and Bill Dunn left the company, fearing they could not survive the dangers of the river much longer. They hiked out of the canyon and were never seen again. Historians still dispute their fate, but it is often proposed that they were killed by local Shivwits Indians in a case of mistaken identity. Another story suggests that they were executed by Mormons who mistook them for \\"spies.\\" On August 30, Powell and the five others reached safety at the Mormon settlement of St. Thomas near the mouth of the Virgin River. Dramatization The expedition was dramatized in the 1960 Disney film Ten Who Dared and the 2015 play Men on Boats by Jaclyn Backhaus. The graphic novel, \\"Major Impossible\\" by author Nathan Hale also dramatizes the expedition. See also *Sam Adams (explorer) ReferencesFurther reading * Powell, J. W. (1895).

It was originally conceived as a technology demonstrator, later entered in the United States Air Force's (USAF) Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) competition but lost to the F-15E Strike Eagle. Several years after the prototypes were shelved, they were turned over to NASA for additional aeronautical research. Both aircraft are currently stored at Edwards AFB. Development=SCAMP Model 400 design team, starting left: Harry Hillaker, Andrew Lewis, Kenny Barnes, Jim Gordon In 1977, the F-16XL started out as the F-16 SCAMP (Supersonic Cruise And Maneuver Prototype) at General Dynamics Fort Worth. Under the leadership of Harry Hillaker (father of the original F-16), the original goal of the program was to be a quick project to demonstrate the applicability of supersonic transport technologies to military aircraft. The big wing generated a lot of lift, and typical aerodynamic limitations of delta wings were overcome by the F-16's relaxed static stability. The F-16's electronic flight control system was tweaked to allow control at high angles of attack. The wing was also a big fuel tank which greatly increased range. The study went on for two years. The goal of the cranked arrow was to have a high sweep inboard panel for low drag at supersonic speeds, and a low sweep outboard panel to provide better handling and maneuverability at subsonic speeds. Working closely with NASA's Langley Research Center, the company invested significant Internal Research and Development (IRAD) funds for wind tunnel testing and that led to the Model 400. It featured all moving wing tips for roll control and an all moving vertical tail. These surfaces were actually the horizontal tail surfaces from the F-16A. These surfaces were later dropped as they did not provide adequate control at low speed, high angle of attack. Also, there would have been no provision for wing-tip mounted missiles. The main wing incorporated forebody strakes to enhance vortex generation for high angle of attack maneuverability, negative stability for improved subsonic lift and reduced supersonic drag. It was built around a 40-inch fuselage stretch. Both the large wing and fuselage stretch yielded a dramatic increase in range at all speeds. In 1979, with a strong positive response by the USAF, GD released the Model 400 for a company funded preliminary design effort.. Enhanced Tactical Fighter competition F-16XL and a conventional F-16 In 1980, the USAF signed on as a partner, providing the third and fifth production F-16 airframes for conversion. These two airframes became the only examples of the F-16XL. In March 1981, the USAF announced the Enhanced Tactical Fighter program to procure a replacement for the F-111 Aardvark. The concept envisioned an aircraft capable of launching deep interdiction missions without requiring additional support in the form of fighter escort or jamming support. Under the leadership of program director Randy Kent , General Dynamics submitted the F-16XL, while McDonnell Douglas submitted a variant of the F-15 Eagle. Though the two aircraft were competing for the same role, they were fairly different in design approach. The F-15E is basically an F-15D two-seat trainer with the back-seat station modified to support ground-attack instruments, while the F-16XL has major structural and aerodynamic differences from the original F-16. As such, the XL would have required much more effort, time and money to put into full production. Additionally, the Strike Eagle has two engines, which gives it more thrust and capacity to carry more weapons and/or armor. Furthermore, engine redundancy can be very useful for an aircraft whose mission involves operating within the reach of anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles, in addition to the standard threats of fighter aircraft and interceptors. In February 1984, the USAF awarded the ETF contract to McDonnell Douglas. The two F-16XLs were returned to the Air Force and placed in storage at Edwards Air Force Base, Mojave, California. Design An air-to-air left underside view of an F-16XL aircraft. The aircraft is armed with two wingtip-mounted AIM-9 Sidewinder and four fuselage-mounted AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles along with 12 Mark 82 500-pound bombs. The wing and rear horizontal control surfaces were replaced with a cranked-arrow delta wing 120% larger than the original wing. Extensive use of carbon fiber composites allowed the savings of 600 lb (270 kg) of weight but the F-16XL was still 2,800 lb (1,300 kg) heavier than the original F-16A. Less noticeable is that the fuselage was lengthened by 56 in (1.4 m) by the addition of two sections at the joints of the main fuselage sub-assemblies. With the new wing design, the tail section had to be canted up 3¬∞, and the ventral fins removed, to prevent them from striking the pavement during takeoff and landing. However, as the F-16XL exhibits greater stability than the native F-16, these changes were not detrimental to the handling of the aircraft. These changes resulted in a 25% improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio in supersonic flight and 11% in subsonic flight, and a plane that reportedly handled much more smoothly at high speeds and low altitudes. The enlargements increased fuel capacity by 82%. The F-16XL could carry twice the ordnance of the F-16 and deliver it 40% farther. The enlarged wing allowed a total of 27 hardpoints: * 16 wing stations of capacity 750 lb (340 kg) each * 4 semi-recessed AIM-120 AMRAAM stations under fuselage * 2 wingtip stations * 1 centerline station * 2 wing \\"heavy/wet\\" stations * 2 chin LANTIRN stations However, the \\"heavy/wet\\" stations interfered with up to four wing stations. Operational history=NASA testing NASA F-16XL #2 conducting laminar flow research In 1988, the two aircraft were taken out of storage and turned over to NASA for research. The first aircraft was fitted with an active suction titanium glove encasing the left wing and delivered to the Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards AFB. Designed and built by North American Aviation (a division of Rockwell International), the glove had laser-cut holes that were nominally 0.0025 in (0.0635 mm) diameter. Distance between holes varied between 0.010 and 0.055 in (0.25 and 1.40 mm) depending on the suction. The glove covered over 5 ft¬≤ (0.5 m¬≤) of the wing. It was intended to suck away turbulent airflow over the wing, restoring laminar flow and reducing drag. The aircraft was also involved in testing sonic boom characteristics, takeoff performance, and engine noise, for NASA's civil transport program. The second aircraft (a two-seater) had its experimental engine replaced with a General Electric F110-129. It accidentally achieved supercruise, a design goal of the F-16XL that was never attained in ETF testing, when it reached Mach 1.1 at 20,000 ft (6,096 m) on full military power. It was mounted with a passive fiberglass and foam glove on the right wing to examine supersonic flow, and an active glove on the left wing. This second glove was composed of fiberglass and foam over a titanium skin, and covers 75% of the wing's surface and 60% of its leading edge. The active portion consists the middle two-thirds of the glove, with laser-drilled holes leading to cavities beneath the wing. It was designed collaboratively by Langley research center, Dryden, Rockwell, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas. The glove is intended as a testbed for supersonic laminar flow. The F-16XL flight project office was located at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards AFB, CA. The NASA Langley Research Center, developed and coordinated F-16XL experiments. At the conclusion of their test programs in 1999, both F-16XLs were placed into storage at NASA Dryden. In 2007, NASA approached Lockheed Martin to request a study into the feasibility and cost of returning F-16XL #1 to flight status and upgrading it with many of the improvements found in the USAF's F-16 Block 40. This was studied while F-16XL #1 was taxi tested at Dryden and given systems checks. However, both F-16XLs were retired in 2009 and stored at Edwards AFB.

Anderson and Blanchard adopted this name after joining the WWF in 1988 from Jim Crockett Promotions, where the two men had wrestled as part of The Four Horsemen stable and had won the NWA World Tag Team Championship twice. As a team, Anderson and Blanchard are regarded by WWE as three-time world tag team champions, having won the WWF Tag Team Championship during their time in the WWF. History=National Wrestling Alliance Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard were founding members of the Four Horsemen, and often teamed up for six and eight man tag team matches with Ric Flair and Ole Anderson. Blanchard was the number two heel in the NWA, behind only NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair, winning the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, the NWA National Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Television Championship. Meanwhile, Anderson was designated as the \\"Enforcer\\" of the stable, and teamed with Ole Anderson as the final version of The Minnesota Wrecking Crew. In the spring of 1987, Ole was kicked out of the Four Horsemen, and was replaced with associate member Lex Luger. Shortly after losing the Television Title, Blanchard quickly began teaming with Arn and targeted the NWA World Tag Team titles. =First reign= Tully and Arn won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on September 29, 1987 by defeating The Rock 'n' Roll Express after The Midnight Express attacked Ricky Morton prior to the match. They were immediately challenged by The Road Warriors to a title match at Starrcade '87 in the LOD hometown of Chicago. Despite a hostile pro LOD crowd, the Horsemen retained the titles on a reverse decision. The Horseman would next receive a stiff challenge from ex-Horsemen Lex Luger, and longtime Horseman rival Barry Windham, who were dubbed the Twin Towers. The teams met at Clash of the Champions I live on TBS and the challengers upset the Horsemen, when heel miscommunication caused Anderson to get hit by a chair from Horsemen manager J.J. Dillon, and pinned by Luger. =Second reign= Arn and Tully regained the titles less than a month later on April 20, 1988 when Barry Windham turned on his tag-team partner and joined the Four Horsemen. The duo would mainly defend the titles against various combinations of teams between the trio of Sting, Nikita Koloff and \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams. Things began to sour behind the scenes for the champions, as the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) launched its first-ever uninterrupted pay-per-view, The Great American Bash, promoters were attempting to draw a large gate and, according to the DVD Ric Flair and The Four Horsemen, Blanchard had suggested a rematch with the Road Warriors, but instead they were booked against Sting and Koloff, (whom they wrestled to a time limit draw), and when the PPV payouts were given out, it was discovered that Dillon who was their manager received 3 times the payout of the 2-time World Tag Team Champions. This was the last straw for Blanchard, who saw this as an insult and immediately prepared to give his notice. Meanwhile, on camera, the champions had begun a feud with NWA United States Tag Team champions The Midnight Express, with the storyline being that Anderson and Blanchard considered the Midnight Express to be ungrateful punks who weren't on their level. The Midnight Express won the titles from the Horsemen on September 10, 1988, as both Blanchard and Anderson gave their notices to Jim Crockett Promotions, ending the original Four Horsemen and according to Blanchard, it was the end of an era. World Wrestling Federation The duo made their debut late in October 1988, as \\"The Brain Busters\\", due to being under management of Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan (and, by default, members of the Heenan Family). It was commonplace for the WWF at this time to assign wrestlers to some sort of gimmick, or new identity. Aside from the Brain Busters team name, Anderson and Blanchard were allowed to keep their names and ring persona. The only changes Arn and Tully made to their style were pointing to their heads to show they were smarter than everyone else and the use of a spike piledriver as a finishing move. The Brain Busters made their pay-per-view (PPV) debut at the 1988 Survivor Series in the 10 team tag match, where they eliminated the Hart Foundation, before being eliminated via double disqualification with the Rockers. This led to a match with the Rockers on WWF Superstars of Wrestling where both teams were again disqualified before the match could even get started. This kicked off a red hot series of house show matches. One match in particular on January 23, 1989 was rated as one of the 50 greatest matches in the Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) 10th anniversary issue, where the Brain Busters narrowly defeated the Rockers as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The teams wrestled to a double countout on the March 11, 1989 Saturday Night's Main Event XX. The Brain Busters made their first and only WrestleMania appearance at WrestleMania V against former WWF Tag Team Champions Strike Force. After an even start, the Brain Busters dominated the ex-champions as Rick Martel walked out on Tito Santana and he was brutalized and beaten after a spike piledriver and eventually pinned. After their WrestleMania win, the Brain Busters finally got to face the WWF World Tag Team Champions Demolition and defeated them by disqualification on the May 27, 1989 Saturday Night's Main Event XXI. The Brain Busters defeated Demolition for the titles in a rematch on July 18, 1989 in a two out of three falls match. After losing the first fall, by pinfall, the Busters won the second fall, via disqualification, and won the third fall, with a distraction from Bobby Heenan and a steel chair thrown in from Andr√© the Giant, the Brain Busters ended Demolition's then-record-breaking 478-day title reign and became the first team to win both the WWF and NWA World Tag Team Championship. It also was the first time a title changed hands in a two- out-of-three falls match where one of the decisions ended in a disqualification. After then defeating The Hart Foundation in a non-title match at SummerSlam, they then lost the titles back to Demolition on October 2, 1989, in an equally controversial fashion as Blanchard, who was the illegal man, was pinned after receiving the Demolition Decapitation finisher. As was customary at the time, the Busters continued to defend the titles on house shows until the title change was acknowledged on television on November 4, 1989. =Split= Their last match was a best-of-three-falls contest against The Rockers on Saturday Night's Main Event XXIV. The Brain Busters lost the first fall after not following directions from an enraged Heenan, who left the ringside area. The Brain Busters won the second fall, after which Heenan fired them during a backstage interview. The Rockers would go on to win the third and final fall of the match. On the day of the 1989 Survivor Series, Tully Blanchard failed a drug test and the lack of a suitable replacement saw him replaced by Heenan who would wrestle for the first time since WrestleMania V. Arn Anderson left the federation more or less immediately after the pay-per- view and returned to the NWA in December. However, the NWA refused to rehire Blanchard when news of his failed drug test became known, thus ending the Brain Busters for good. Tully Blanchard would renegotiate a new contract with NWA a few months later, but ultimately declined what he considered to be a very low offer (reportedly half of a previous verbal agreement), and instead signed with the American Wrestling Association (AWA).

The army was officially disbanded in 1885 as a result of the Treaty of Tientsin between the French and the Qing. However, remnants of the army continued to wage a guerilla war against French colonial authorities for years. The rise and fall of the Black Flag Army A Black Flag ambush, 1883 In 1857, Liu Yongfu (Vietnamese: L∆∞u Vƒ©nh Ph√∫c), a Hakka soldier of fortune, commanded a group of about 200 men within a larger bandit group in Guangxi province headed by Huang Sihong (ÈªÉÊÄùÂÆè). He defected with his men to the band of Wu Yuanqing (Wu Yuan-ch'ing, Âê≥ÂÖÉÊ∏Ö) under his own - black - flag. Liu organized a ceremony reminiscent of the tiandihui (Â§©Âú∞‰ºö) rituals and what became known as the Black Flag Army was born. The \\"army\\" operated as an independent unit under Wu Yuanqing and under his son and successor, Wu Yazhong (Wu Ya-chung, Âê≥‰∫ûÁµÇ)also known under other names, such as Wu Azhong (Wu Ah-chung, Âê≥ÈòøÂø†) as in McAleavy, 1968. or Wu Hezhong. Although not part of the Taiping forces, both Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yazhong laid claim to be Taiping \\"princes\\". After Qing forces crushed the Taiping Rebellion in 1864 in Nanking, the Qing army proceeded to destroy systematically the many armed bands of south-eastern provinces. Hotly pursued, the desperate Wu Yazhong, with Liu and his Black Flag Army, crossed into Upper Tonkin in 1865. The Black Flags demonstrated their usefulness to the Vietnamese court by helping the suppression of the indigenous tribes populating the mountainous terrain between the Red and Black Rivers, and for this Liu was rewarded with an official military title. Secured with the backing of the Vietnamese court, Liu Yongfu established a profitable extortion network along the course of the Red River, \\"taxing\\" river commerce between S∆°n T√¢y and L√†o Cai at a rate of 10%. The profits accrued from this venture were so great that Liu's army swelled in numbers in the 1870s, attracting to its ranks adventurers from all over the world. Although most of the Black Flag soldiers were Chinese, the junior officers included American and European soldiers of fortune, some of whom had seen action in the Taiping Rebellion. Liu used their expertise to transform the Black Flag Army into a formidable fighting force. Under his command in Tonkin he had 7,000 soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi.(Original from Harvard University) The harassment of European vessels trading on the Red River triggered the dispatch of the French expeditionary force to Tonkin under Commandant Henri Rivi√®re in 1882. The resulting clashes between the French and the Black Flag Army (the latter abetted by the regular Vietnamese and Chinese forces) escalated, resulting eventually in the Sino-French War (August 1884-April 1885). The Black Flags assisted the Chinese forces during this war, best known for the fierce Siege of Tuy√™n Quang when the joint Black Flags-Chinese armies holed up a battalion of the French Foreign Legion defending the citadel. The Black Flag Army formally disbanded at the end of the Sino-French War, though many of its members continued to harass the French for years afterwards as freelance bandits. Remarkably, Liu Yongfu revived the Black Flag Army again in 1895 in response to the Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895). Liu Yongfu crossed to Taiwan at the appeal of his old friend Tang Jingsong, the island's former governor-general and now president of the short-lived Republic of Formosa. Liu was to command the Formosan resistance forces against the Japanese. Liu took a number of aging Black Flag veterans back into service to join the fight against the Japanese, but the reconstituted Black Flag Army was swept aside with ease by the Japanese Imperial Guards Division. Liu himself was obliged to disguise himself as an old woman to escape capture. An entry on the Black Flags in \\"Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events, Volume 8; Volume 23\\" \\"The Black Flags-More formidable than the Anamese army were the irregular soldiers known as the Black and the Yellow Flags. These troops were not Anamese. but Chinese, and it is not known to what extent they were augmented by volunteers from the neighboring Chinese provinces. They are survivors of the valorous Taeping rebels who held the military power of the Chinese Empire at bay for many years. In 1865 the rebels, who had retired before the Chinese troops into the province of Kwangsi, were finally driven across the border into Tonquin, and found a secure retreat in the mountains on both sides of the Red river valley. This band of exiles, numbering about 5,000, were accompanied by -their wives and families. Their chief was Watsong, one of Taeping Wang's principal lieutenants, and many of them continued the freebooting practices into which the rebellion degenerated in its latter period. They offered no further hostility to the Chinese Government, but rather became the supporters and instruments of Chinese policy and influence in Anam. The Anamese troops were sent against them several times, but were invariably defeated. In 1868 they held undisputed possession of the whole right bank of the Red river above the capital. With the assistance of the Chinese Viceroy of Canton, or Governor-General of the two Kwang, they were finally expelled from the low country and confined to the upper course of the river. Soon after Watsong died, and his followers divided into two bands. The main body of the original Taeping rebels were disposed to settle down to peaceful pursuits, and to make their submission to the Chinese and Anamese authorities. They adopted the yellow flag for their ensign, and chose for their chief llwang Tsoug 1n, who had been a soldier in the Chinese territorial army of Kwangsi. The smaller band. which retained the black flag, was composed of criminals and desperate characters who had joined the band of Watsong in the hope of plunder or to escape from justice, and their new leader was formerly the most famous brigand in the province of Kwangsi. The 1principal settlement of the Black Flags is at aokai, on Red river; that of the Yellow Flags at Hagiung, farther in the interior and east. of that place. The Anamese subsidized the Yellow Flags. partly to act as a check upon the troublesome Black Flags, and were glad to avail themselves of both in their conflicts with the French. It was through a want of precaution against the skill aud courage of the Black Flags that Garnier lost his life in 1873, and through a repetition of the same blunder Riviera sufiered defeat and death in 1883. Both the Black and Yellow Flags have greatly increased in number since they were expelled from Chinese territory, the former numbering in 1883 probably not fewer than 5,000 warriors, and the latter perhaps twice as many.\\" The Black Flag Army in action=Defeat of Francis Garnier's invasion of Tonkin, December 1873 Black Flag soldiers, 1873 In 1873 the Vietnamese government enlisted the help of the Black Flag Army to defeat the first French attempt to conquer Tonkin, led by the naval lieutenant Francis Garnier. On 21 December 1873 Liu Yongfu and around 600 Black Flags (), marching beneath an enormous black banner, approached the west gate of the Hanoi Citadel. A large Vietnamese army followed in their wake. Garnier ordered the shelling of the Black Flags with a field piece mounted above the gate, and when they were repulsed, he led a party of 18 French marine infantrymen out of the gate in pursuit. Garnier and three of his men charged uphill in a bayonet attack on a party of Black Flags but was speared to death after stumbling in a watercourse. The youthful enseigne de vaisseau Adrien-Paul Balny d‚ÄôAvricourt led a similar small column to reinforce Garnier but was also killed in front of his men. Three other French soldiers were killed in these sorties, and the others fled back to the citadel after their officers fell. Garnier's death shocked the French public and ended the first French adventure in Tonkin.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 126‚Äì8 Defeat of Henri Rivi√®re's invasion of Tonkin, May 1883 Ten years later, with France again pushing into Tonkin, undeclared hostilities broke out in 1883 and the first half of 1884 as a prelude to the Sino-French War. The Black Flags fought several engagements against French forces in Tonkin. The first major clash was at the Battle of Paper Bridge (19 May 1883), in which the French naval captain Henri Rivi√®re was ambushed and killed. It was a swift and striking victory for the Black Flag Army.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 152‚Äì7 Indecisive clashes, summer 1883 In the Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i (15 August 1883), the Black Flag Army successfully defended its positions against a French attack launched by General Alexandre- Eug√®ne Bou√´t, though it took considerably higher casualties than the French.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 162‚Äì5 In the Battle of Palan (1 September 1883) the Black Flags did less well, being driven from a key position on the River ƒê√°y.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 166‚Äì7 Disaster at S∆°n T√¢y, December 1883 In December 1883 the Black Flag Army suffered a major defeat at the hands of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet in the S∆°n T√¢y Campaign. Despite fighting with fanatical courage in the engagements at Phu Sa on 14 December and Son Tay on 16 December, the Black Flags were unable to prevent the French from storming S∆°n T√¢y. Even with large Chinese and Vietnamese regular contingents at Son Tay, the Black Flag Army bore the brunt of the fighting, and took very heavy casualties. In the opinion of the British observer William Mesny, a senior officer in the Chinese army, the fighting at S∆°n T√¢y broke the power of the Black Flag Army, though the stubborn defence put up by the Black Flags in the Battle of H√≤a M·ªôc fifteen months later does not bear out this assessment.Huard, 180‚Äì7 and 202‚Äì31; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 171‚Äì7; Histoire militaire, 68‚Äì72 Loss of H∆∞ng H√≥a, April 1884 The Black Flag Army took no part in the B·∫Øc Ninh Campaign (March 1884). After the French capture of Bac Ninh, the Black Flags retreated to H∆∞ng H√≥a. In April 1884 the French advanced on H∆∞ng H√≥a with both brigades of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. The Black Flags had thrown up an impressive series of fortifications around the town, but General Charles-Th√©odore Millot, the French commander-in-chief, took it without a single French casualty. While General Fran√ßois de N√©grier's 2nd Brigade pinned the Black Flags frontally from the east and subjected Hung Hoa to a ferocious artillery bombardment from the Trung Xa heights, General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle's 1st Brigade made a flank march to the south to cut Liu's line of retreat. On the evening of 11 April, seeing Bri√®re de l'Isle's Turcos and marine infantry emerging behind their flank at Xuan Dong, the Black Flags evacuated Hung Hoa before they were trapped inside it. They set alight the remaining buildings before they left, and on the following morning the French found the town completely abandoned.Huard, 280‚Äì90; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 84 Loss of Tuyen Quang, June 1884 The Black Flag Army retreated up the Red River to Thanh Quan, only a few days march from the frontier town of L√†o Cai. Several hundred Black Flag soldiers, demoralised by the ease with which Courbet and Millot had defeated the Black Flag Army, surrendered to the French in the summer of 1884. One of Millot's final achievements was to advance up the Clear River and throw the Black Flag Army out of Tuy√™n Quang in the first week of June, again without a single French casualty. If the French had seriously pursued Liu Yongfu after the capture of Tuy√™n Quang, the Black Flags would probably have been driven from Tonkin there and then. But French attention was diverted by the sudden crisis with China provoked by the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush (23 June 1884), and during the eventful summer of 1884 the Black Flags were left to lick their wounds.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 85‚Äì7 Alliance with the Chinese, September 1884 to April 1885 The fortunes of the Black Flag Army were transformed by the outbreak of the Sino-French War in August 1884. The Empress Dowager Cixi responded to the news of the destruction of China's Fujian Fleet at the Battle of Fuzhou (23 August 1884) by ordering her generals to invade Tonkin to throw the French out of Hanoi. Tang Jingsong, the commander of the Yunnan Army, knew that Liu's services would be invaluable in the war with France, and Liu agreed to take part with the Black Flag Army in the forthcoming campaign. The Black Flags helped the Chinese forces put pressure on Hung Hoa and the isolated French posts of Phu Doan and Tuyen Quang during the autumn of 1884. The battle of H√≤a M·ªôc, March 1885 A soldier of the Black Flag Army, 1885 A Black Flag banner, captured by the French at Hoa Moc (2 March 1885) and now displayed in the Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e, Paris In the winter and spring of 1885 3,000 soldiers of the Black Flag Army served during the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang. At the Battle of H√≤a M·ªôc (2 March 1885), the Black Flag Army inflicted heavy casualties on a French column marching to the relief of Tuy√™n Quang. French casualties at H√≤a M·ªôc were 76 dead and 408 wounded, the highest casualty rate and the heaviest loss in a single day's fighting sustained by the French during the Sino-French War. Many French officers at H√≤a M·ªôc said that the carnage was even worse than at S∆°n T√¢y fifteen months earlier.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 247‚Äì8; Histoire militaire, 107‚Äì8 Disbandment of the Black Flag Army, June 1885 One of the conditions of the peace treaty between France and China that ended the Sino-French War was that Liu Yongfu should leave Tonkin. By the end of the war Liu had only around 2,000 troops under his command and was in no position to resist pressure from Tang Jingsong and the other commanders of the Yunnan Army to remove the Black Flag Army. Liu crossed into China with some of his most loyal followers, but the bulk of the Black Flag Army was disbanded on Tonkinese soil in the summer of 1885. Unpaid for months and still in possession of their rifles, most of the unwanted Black Flag soldiers immediately took to banditry, under cover of the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng resistance movement against the French. It took months for the French to reduce them, and the route between Hung Hoa and the border town of Lao Cai was only secured in February 1886. In 1887, Black Flag bandits remained sufficiently powerful to ransack and pillage Luang Prabang.  Flags of the Black Flag Army  A possible reconstruction of Liu Yongfu's command flags at S∆°n T√¢y Liu Yongfu evidently had a personal preference for the colour black, having dreamt in his youth that he would one day become a 'general of the black tiger'. The Black Flag Army is named from the colour of Liu's command flags.McAleavy, 102 and 105 French sources invariably mention that Liu Yongfu's personal command flags were very large, black in colour, and rectangular. In December, 1873, when Liu Yongfu confronted Francis Garnier outside Hanoi, the Black Flag Army was described as marching under enormous black flags. At the Battle of Palan (September 1, 1883), Liu Yongfu's headquarters was marked with seven identical black flags that were bordered in silver. In the S∆°n T√¢y Campaign (December, 1883), Liu Yongfu ordered three large black flags to be flown above the main gate of the citadel of S∆°n T√¢y, bearing Chinese characters in white. Individual Black Flag units flew a variety of flags, some rectangular and others triangular. In the afternoon of August 15, 1883, during the Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i, several units of the Black Flag Army emerged from their defences and advanced across open ground to attack the French left wing; according to a French eyewitness, the advancing Black Flag units bore numerous black banners decorated with Chinese characters in either red or white.Duboc, 174 Surviving Black Flag banners include a black triangular banner with a representation in white of the seven stars of the Great Bear. The reconstruction shown here displays the Chinese character ‰ª§, which translate to English currently means \\"order\\" or \\"command\\".

Nos Lowen is Cornish for \\"happy night\\".A bit of history on the Cumpas website: \\"A personal account of the remarkable revival of Cornish music and dance, and why it matters\\". By Neil Davey (originally published in Cornish World)\\" see Cumpas Ltd. Nos lowen is a relatively recent development in Cornish music and dance, which started in the 1990s, some twenty years after the beginning of the revival of Cornish dancing generally. It may be a reaction to the more formal approaches of the earlier revival, in which the social dance nights, known as troyls, present the Cornish dances in the style of a Scottish or Irish ceilidh. The nos lowen approach on the other hand was inspired by the Breton fest noz format, which itself had emerged in the 1960s. With both nos lowen and fest noz they were new ways of celebrating what were often quite ancient dances from their respective regions. Nos lowen was initially spearheaded by the Cornish group Sowena, and traditional dancers. It places greater emphasis on simpler dances, which are also often the oldest ones, such as snake dances and furry dances, in order to increase participation and remove the need for a caller. The nos lowen movement continues to enjoy much success in Cornwall as does the troyl/ceilidh approach. While nos lowen is essentially a dance style, an associated style of music has grown around it which is generally more progressive than many folk bands, possibly to appeal to a younger audience. It also places more emphasis on rhythms and longer songs in order to produce the tribal trance-like state associated with the repetitive dances. Exponents include Tredanek, Dalla, Davey&Dyer;, Heb Mar. The plural of Nos Lowen should technically be 'Nosow Lowen' if you're speaking Cornish, but people often simply say 'Nos Lowens' when speaking English In the same way people might pluralise 'Ceilidhs' in English. 'Nos lowen' is sometimes abbreviated by 'Nsl' online or in event listings. The earlier spelling 'Noze looan' was based on the late Cornish orthography; with the introduction of the standard written form of Cornish, the spelling 'nos lowen' is now used.

It is desirable to retract the leg immediately after delivering the kick, to avoid the opponent trying to grapple the leg and (unless a combination is in process) to return to stable fighting stance. The front kick described is the typical basic front kick of karate or taekwondo. But the front kick can also be defined more broadly as a straight forward kick directly to the front, and then include several variations from many different styles. A front kick can be delivered forward in a penetrating way (hip thrust), or upwards to attack the head.  Details of the technique  Taekwondo front kick In martial arts implying either barefooted combat or very light footwear, the strike is usually delivered by using ball of the foot (while pointing the foot toward the target area and keeping toes up to prevent injury) or by heel. When heavier footwear is used, there is an option using whole sole as a striking surface. It is also possible to kick with the top of the foot (the instep) in cases of striking at the groin or under the arm which can be very damaging. Using ball of a foot is preferred in karate. This method demands more control of one's movement, but allows for narrow, penetrating strike. Taekwondo practitioners utilise both heel and ball of the foot for striking. It is common to perform tempering exercises to strengthen ball of the foot, as many new practitioners are unable to exercise full-power front kicks on training gear, such as body bag. With specific techniques and in certain styles, the impact point of the front kick can be more exotic. Certain Japanese styles have a front kick generally used as a stop-kick where the blade of the foot is used to connect, like for a side kick (the foot blade front kick). The heel is often used straight () or with the foot tilted (tilted heel front kick), especially in stop-kicks, close kicks or high front kicks. Japanese nin-jitsu has variations using the straightened and hardened toes. Front kicks to the groin ({{translkokin geri) like the lift kick or the upward front kick (), use the top of the foot. The phantom groin kick uses the whole of the inside of the foot to connect very effectively. Stop kicks often use the whole plant of the foot to push away the opponent.De Bremaeker, M. et al., The Essential Book of Martial Arts Kicks: 89 Kicks from Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and others (Tuttle Publishing, 2010), p. 23. Various combat systems teach 'general' front kick using heel or whole foot when footwear is on. For example, martial art systems employed by military assume that a fighter wears heavy footwear, is generally less mobile than typically assumed in competition martial arts, and may have his/hers leg muscles severely fatigued. Properly executing fast 'snap' front kick while controlling one's foot direction may be difficult in said conditions. Less technically demanding kick utilizing sole of heavy footwear as a striking surface is easier to execute. The front kick is typically performed with the straight and balanced upper body, but it allows for variety in motion of hips and body overall. Martial arts systems exploit this ability in different fashions. For example, a may perform while standing upright, or lean somewhat back during the attack, intending to increase the reach of the kick. If a simple 'kick-punch' combination is executed, this slight lean allows for more momentum placed into the movement of upper body, thus the will end with a more powerful body movement behind the punch. The opposite situation is exploited in some variations of Wing Chun, where stiff forward motion of both hands blocking/striking in upper area could be accompanied with a slight leaning forward and simultaneous front kick into groin/thigh, etc. Hips movement may be used to increase the reach and to thrust one's leg into the target, resulting in more powerful strike (a common practice in taekwondo and some styles of karate).  Applications and counters  Front-Kick Front kicks are typically aimed at targets below the chest: stomach, thighs, groin, knees or lower. Highly skilled martial artists are often capable of striking head-level targets with front kick (albeit rarely use it this way). The front kick is fast and involves little body motion betraying the technique's nature prior to execution. This makes a well-developed front kick an excellent asset in both offence and defense. When defending, front kick could be used to severely damage the lower area of the opponent who has started an attack, but has overconcentrated on guarding head/upper body, and as a good tool to keep enemy from punch range. In offense, front kick could serve as an excellent opener for combination attacks, as it is fast, dangerous enough for opponent to switch attention to block/deflecting/evading the kick, but requires little deviation from the upright fighting stance, which is good to start punch attack from. Overall, there is a wide variety of situations where this kick could be exploited by a creative martial arts practitioner. Common ways to counter aa front kick are deflecting it with hand, shin, etc., stepping away/sideways, or, given the kick is visibly pointed into abdomen/thighs area, shifting a body so it passes along. The last method is somewhat risky, as it relies heavily on defender's agility, with a front kick being one of the fastest kicks possible. More exotic techniques of countering front kicks exist, like one incorporated in (referred to as , or prearranged, kumite, in some schools). Said technique involves simultaneously pushing opponents leg away from one's centerline and attacking the leg with a downward elbow strike into the hip. However, this method is not recommended to beginners and as a general purpose one. Also, although well-executed front kick is very fast, a careless execution presents an opponent with excellent opportunity for grappling, which could be disastrous for an attacker. Once the leg is grappled, a variety of attacks is available to a defender, such as wrestling techniques resulting in pain compliance hold, immediate counterattack with punches, throws, kicks into lower area and combinations of all above. For this reason, 'recocking' the leg after the kick is truly important, especially in real-life situations, where rules common to many competition martial arts do not apply. However, executing front kicks to the waist and below is relatively safe and effective, given the leg is immediately retracted.  In Tae Kwon Do  In taekwondo, the front kick bears the name . It is distinct from the push kick () in that the power should be delivered instantaneously. Since the leg moves forward while the shin and foot naturally swing upwards, the easiest application of this kick is that of directing one's energy upwards, perhaps considering it a \\"kick to the groin\\". However, one can deliver massive force forward with this kick as well, which is considered its main application by most instructors. Directed forward, this is actually one of the most powerful kicks in Taekwondo, and it is quite often used in exhibitions and board- breaking competitions where power is demonstrated. In order to not injure ones toes while executing this kick, it is usually delivered through the front base of the foot (), if not with the flat upper side of the foot (). If performed with the bare foot then the ball of the foot is used on impact with the toes drawn up to prevent injury. To strike with ap chook one has to raise one's toes so that their tips will not be the first contact point. Even when directed forward, this is not a kick where the first contact point should be the base of the heel, as is considered beneficial in some other martial arts having a similar kick. In Taekwondo, one would strike forward with the ankle extended, so that the upper side of the foot forms a straight line with the shin, and with the toes bent back (pointing up). In other words, an \\"\\". Having the foot in any other position when directing this kick strictly forward would be considered highly unorthodox, and is a common error among beginners. In addition to being a kick in itself, the front kick is an exercise used by many instructors to teach the principle of lifting ones knee before the rest of the kick commences, something which is considered important in taekwondo, where it is somewhat literally translated from the Korean (ÏïûÏ∞®Í∏∞), (and many kicking arts with the notable exception of capoeira). In competition fights (known as \\"sparring\\" or \\"\\") this kick sees little actual use, except possibly as a component in an improvised kick which is perhaps intended as an \\"\\" or \\"\\". It is common to slightly bend the knee of the leg one is standing on when executing this kick, and pointing the foot one is standing on somewhat outwards. As in all taekwondo kicks, one will also try to get ones \\"hip into the kick\\", resulting perhaps in a slight shift of weight forward. In any case, this is a linear kick, and as such one that one can get ones weight behind. There exist countless variations of this kick, and it can be used along with other kicks without one having to put ones kicking foot down in between kicks. A very common variation is \\"\\", a flying front kick which can reach an impressive height. Some instructors refer to this kick as the \\"flash kick\\". This is in tune with the line of thought which seems prevalent in the various taekwondo forms, where the is used very extensively in combination with relatively short range hand strikes and blocks, mimicking situations in which it would have to be performed quite quickly.  Karate  The front kick, called in Japanese, is certainly the main kick in traditional karate of all styles. It is the most used kick in traditional forms and the most practiced kick in traditional practice. The kick is a very strong and fast strike, and easier to master than less ‚Äúnatural‚Äù kicks. The kick generally connects with the ball of the foot, under the toes, but other points of impact are sometimes used in the many variants existing in Japanese karate and other styles. It can be thrusting () or snapping (), or somewhere in between. In its thrusting or form the kicker pushes the foot into the target powerfully leveraging the momentum of his own body weight in order to propel the opponent or target backwards. In its snapping or form the kicker emphasizes the extremely quick retraction or recoil or re-chamber of the foot and the lower leg immediately after impact (thereby making it difficult to catch or grab the leg by the opponent); The kick exhibits less pushing force but more breaking impact than the form of the kick. It can be delivered with hopping () or jumping (), and sometimes with a straight leg all-the-way (). It can be executed with the front leg, defensively or hopping forward, or the rear leg. It can be executed with nearly square hips, or with hips lined sideways like the of Karate. There are many other variations, as the kick can also be feinted, angled or delivered from the ground.De Bremaeker, M. et al., The Essential Book of Martial Arts Kicks: 89 Kicks from Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and others (Tuttle Publishing, 2010), p. 25.

The episcopal complex, which comprises the basilica itself, a sacristy, a baptistery and the bell tower of the nearby archbishop's palace, is an excellent example of early Byzantine architecture in the Mediterranean region. The Euphrasian basilica has for the most part retained its original shape, but accidents, fires and earthquakes have altered a few details. Since it is the third church to be built on the same site, it conceals previous buildings, for example the great floor mosaic of the previous basilica from the 5th century. Because of its exceptional value, it has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1997. The Basilica is also the Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Poreƒç-Pula. History The earliest basilica was dedicated to Saint Maurus of Parentium and dates back to the second half of the 4th century. The floor mosaic from its oratory, originally part of a large Roman house, is still preserved in the church garden. This oratorium was already expanded in the same century into a church composed of a nave and one aisle (basilicae geminae). The fish on the floor mosaic dates from this period. Coins with the portrayal of emperor Valens (365‚Äì378), found in the same spot, confirm these dates. The present basilica, dedicated to Mary, was built in the sixth century during the period of Bishop Euphrasius. It was built from 553 on the site of the older basilica that had become dilapidated. For the construction, parts of the former church were used and the marble blocks were imported from the coast of the Sea of Marmara. The wall mosaics were executed by Byzantian masters and the floor mosaics by local experts. The construction took about ten years. Euphrasius, holding the church in his arms, is represented on one of the mosaics on the apse, next to St. Maurus. Following the earthquake of 1440 the southern wall of the central nave of the basilica was restored, so that in place of the windows which were destroyed, other were built in the Gothic style.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriadic Tourist Guide, pg. 12-13, Zagreb (1999), Description View of the basilica The basilica is part of a complex composed of: *A 6th-century octagonal baptistry. Built in the 5th century together with the pre-Euphrasian basilica, and underwent considerable alterations. *A 16th-century bell tower. *A colonnaded atrium. Built after the basilica, it is covered on all four sides by a portico which houses a rich collection of stone monuments. *An Episcopal residence (The Bishop's Palace), also built in the 6th century. Very little remains of the original building. *A trefoil-shaped memorial chapel, built in the 17th and 19th centuries. Basilica entrance. The two aisles are separated from the nave by 18 elegant Greek marble colonnades with richly sculpted Byzantine and Romanesque capitals, decorated with depictions of animals. They all carry the monogram of Saint Euphrasius. The arches between the capitals are decorated with stucco work. A novelty of the Euphrasian basilica is that rather than being enclosed by a straight wall, as all sacred buildings were up to that time, it makes use of the breadth and length of the apse of the central nave, built in the shape of a polygon from the outside, whilst the two aisles end in smaller semicircular apses, hollowed into the wall. Thus the Euphrasian basilica is the earliest example of a triple-apsed church in Western Europe. The atrium is a typical example of Byzantine architecture, as are the columns, the tiles on the altar rail and all the abundant mosaics. Most impressive is the representation of Christ with the apostles, and beneath it a frieze of 13 medallions with a picture of Christ as the Lamb in the centre, surrounded by 12 medallions depicting various martyrs. The church houses also holy objects and other artworks from the Palaeo-Christian, Byzantine and Middle Ages periods. A votive chapel, next to the sacristy, holds the relics of Saint Maurus and Saint Eleutherius. Mosaics Christ and the Twelve Apostles. The most striking feature of the basilica are its mosaics, dating from the 6th century.Unesco: Episcopal Complex of the Euphrasian Basilica in the Historic Centre of Poreƒç at Unesco.org The mosaics in the triumphal arch over the apse represent Christ; holding an opened book with the Latin text \\"Ego sum lux vera\\" (\\"I am the true light\\") with the Apostles, each with their attribute, The arch below contains mosaic medallions with the Lamb of God and portraits of twelve female martyrs. The vault over the apse is decorated with mosaics with Mary and Child, sitting on the Heavenly throne, under a wreath held by a hand - symbol of God the Father. This is the only surviving depiction of the Mother of God in an early- Christian western basilica. She is flanked by angels, Bishop Euphrasius, holding the model of the church; also local saints are depicted, including St. Maurus, the first bishop of Poreƒç and the Istrian diocese, and the archdeacon Claudius .Google translation of Italian text. Probably at the time of Diocletian's persecution of the Christians. The child between Euphrasius and Claudius is accompanied by the inscription \\"Euphrasius, son of the archdeacon\\". All figures stand on a meadow covered with flowers. Mosaic with Mother Mary and Child. Second from left: St. Euphrasius with model of church. The central mosaics between the windows of the apse represent the Annunciation and the Visitation. In the Annunciation mosaic an angel raises his hand to indicate a message. In his left hand he holds the staff of a messenger. Mary wears a purplish blue dress and a veil. She holds yarn in her left hand. On the other side the mosaics depicts the visitation of Mary to Elisabeth. Both wear contemporary sacerdotal vestments with a cape full of ribbons. A small female figure is looking from behind the curtain of a house. The three small medallions depict St. John the Baptist, Zacharias and an angel. Between these two large mosaics are smaller mosaics depicting the Young Christ with halo, and two martyrs with their martyr crown. In the northern apse these are probably Cosmas and Damian, in the south apse Ursus (or another bishop of Ravenna), and Severus. The front wall of the apse is framed with a narrow decorated band filled with praise of Euphrasius and his works. The lower part of the apse is decorated with stone slabs encrusted with mother-of-pearl. Part of these came from an earlier wainscotting. They consist of 21 fields with 11 different decorations. In the middle stands the bishop's throne, flanked by candlesticks. Ciborium Ciborium The apsis is dominated by the marble ciborium, modelled after the one in St. Mark's in Venice,Jeanne Oliver, Croatia, pg. 146, Lonely Planet Publications (2005), it was built in 1277 on the orders of Otto, Bishop of Poreƒç. The canopy, decorated with mosaics, is carried by four marble columns that belonged to the previous 6th-century ciborium. The front side of the canopy depicts representations of scenes from Mary's life, the Annunciation. In the 15th century Bishop Johann Poreƒçanin ordered in Italy a Renaissance relief for the antependium of the altar, made of gilded silver. The polyptych of the Venetian painter Antonio Vivarini dates from the same period. The Last Supper, painted by Palma the Younger is a Baroque work.

It was recorded on the nights of January 23 and January 24, 1999, in front of sold-out crowds of approximately 2000 people (on both nights) at the Rodon Club in Athens, Greece. Iced Earth was supporting the Something Wicked This Way Comes album and were on tour. It was turned into a single DVD, and released in October 2006. The album features the return of former drummer Brent Smedley, who did not record on the band's previous album. At the conclusion of \\"Violate\\", the band plays the opening riff of \\"The Trooper\\" by Iron Maiden. \\"Colors\\" was also played at this concert, but was not included on the CD due to a track listing mix-up. It is, however, included on the reissue of The Melancholy E.P.. Next to the CD version, there also exists a vinyl box version. It was released in 1999 and contained five pictures of the band's albums. One had the Alive in Athens artwork, the other ones had the Night of The Stormrider, Dark Saga, Days of Purgatory and Something Wicked This Way Comes artwork. It came originally with an Alive in Athens poster signed by Jon Schaffer. This box had the same track list as the three-disc version. In 2008, Century Media reissued the three-CD release in a limited mini-LP gatefold sleeve. It included \\"Colors\\" as a bonus track on disc two. According to a 2003 post by Jon Schaffer, the album was certified Platinum in Greece. Track listing= Disc I  Disc II  ;Bonus track (2008 reissue)  Disc III =DVD On October 30, 2006, Century Media released a DVD version featuring live footage of the concert. Shortly before the DVD was publicly released, Iced Earth rhythm guitarist and founder Jon Schaffer offered a statement which voiced dissatisfaction with Century Media (with whom Iced Earth was no longer signed at the time). A portion of this statement reads: \\"I want you all to be aware of what it is that they [Century Media] are releasing. This is a very low-budget, badly edited video of an amazing concert and an awesome period in the history of Iced Earth. They promised me that they are going to keep the price down and that they are not going to market it as something it's not. But I feel it's my responsibility to let you know the reality of the situation.\\" Schaffer did not, however, go so far as to call for a boycott of the product, saying, \\"The decision to purchase the 'Alive in Athens' DVD is up to you. I just want you to be aware of what it is you're getting should you choose to do so.\\" The song order is not identical to that featured on the album version. A few songs are also missing, including \\"Slave to the Dark\\", \\"A Question of Heaven\\", and \\"Iced Earth\\". \\"Colors\\" was played at this concert as well, but was not included on the CD or DVD due to a track listing mix up. It is however included on The Melancholy E.P. and the 2008 re-release of Alive in Athens.

Against the State: An Introduction to Anarchist Political Theory. SUNY Press, 2008. p. 14. and journalist. and is a faculty member of the philosophy department at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Background Born in Washington, D.C., Sartwell is the son of Franklin Gallagher Sartwell, a reporter, editor, and photographer. His grandfather, also Franklin Gallagher Sartwell, was a columnist and editorial page editor at the Washington Times-Herald. His great-grandfather, Herman Bernstein broke the story of a secret correspondence between Kaiser Wilhelm and Czar Nicholas during World War I in The New York Times.The Willy-Nicky Correspondence, with a foreword by Teddy Roosevelt (Toronto: S.B. Gundy, 1918) Sartwell worked as a freelance rock critic for publications, including Record and Melody Maker.Sartwell, Crispin, blog post with links, April 22, 2015. Retrieved 2017-01-31. His mother, Joyce Abell, and stepfather, Richard Abell, were teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland and organic vegetable farmers in Rappahannock County, Virginia. Sartwell received a B.A. from the University of Maryland, College Park, a M.A. from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia‚Äîwhere his dissertation supervisor was Richard Rorty. He has taught philosophy, communication and political science at a number of schools, including Vanderbilt University, The University of Alabama, Penn State, Millersville, the Maryland Institute College of Art, and Dickinson College. Career A journalist since he was 20, Sartwell's syndicated column, distributed by Creators Syndicate, appeared in numerous newspapers through the 1990s and 2000s, including The Philadelphia Inquirer and Los Angeles Times. He has continued to write for the popular press, with work appearing in the New York Times as a contributing writer to the Times's philosophy section, The Stone. He has been published in The Atlantic, Harpers, The Washington Post, All Things Considered and other venues. He has appeared on C-Span's Washington Journal, discussing political philosophy and ethics. Sartwell remains actively involved in music criticism, including writing a country music column for the NY Press. After receiving his BA from the University of Maryland in 1980, Sartwell received his MA in Philosophy from The Johns Hopkins University in 1985. He pursued his doctorate at the University of Virginia, supervised by Richard Rorty, writing his dissertation on Art and Articulation, discussing pictorial representation in Dewey, Heidegger, Goodman and Gadamer. From 1989 through 1993, Sartwell was an Andrew W, Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt University. From 1995 to 1996, Sartwell was an Annenberg Scholar in the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania. Sartwell is best known as a political philosopher, with significant interests in Analytic Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theory of Knowledge. As a political philosopher, he has been an articulate advocate of Anarchism and individual rights as opposed to the rights of the State. In his 2008 work, Against the State: an Introduction to Anarchist Political Philosophy, he refuted the traditional justifications for the state from Hobbes through Nozick. This was followed by his 2010 work, Political Aesthetics, where he evaluated various systems based on the assumption that political systems are in part aesthetic systems. Sartwell's interest in language as a system and its constraints and problems has been a constant in his career. Perhaps his clearest expression of this was in his 2000 publication, End of Story: Toward an Annihilation of Language and History, which posited an academic obsession with language qua language and narrative at the expense of a better conceptual and open dialogue. As a Philosopher of Aesthetics as of language, Sartwell has seen the issues of beauty as being a constant in the search for meaning. His most recent work How to Escape: Magic, Madness, Beauty and Cynicism, published in 2014, looked at a wide variety of artistic expression and experience from an aesthetics perspective. This followed his previous work, 2004's Six Names of Beauty, where he used different words for beauty in a variety of languages including Greek, Sanskrit, Japanese and Navajo as a gateway to understanding the cultural diversity and similarities between ideas and manifestations of beauty. Sartwell acquired a reputation as an epistemologist whose basic ideas on knowledge involve \\"three central claims: (1) knowledge is the ultimate goal-- the telos--of inquiry; (2) knowledge is true belief; and (3) justification is merely a means for arriving at true belief\\". Particularly the claim that knowledge equates to true belief has garnered some attention. On March 3, 2016, Sartwell was placed on leave from his faculty position at Dickinson College in response to posts on his blog in which he accused other philosophy professors of plagiarism. According to Sartwell, the action is related to a video, embedded in the blog post, of Miranda Lambert singing \\"Time to Get a Gun.\\" In September, 2016, the college's student newspaper reported that Sartwell had returned to his position and would resume teaching in the spring of 2017.

It was released on April 21, 1987. Background Prior to the album's recording in January 1987, Testament was known as Legacy. Their lineup consisted of singer Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza, guitarists Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson, bassist Greg Christian and drummer Louie Clemente. Singer Chuck Billy was a member of another local band named Guilt.Guilt Encyclopaedia Metallum (retrieved 21 May 2012) He had performed with Legacy on a few occasions and was asked to become the new singer after Souza left to join Exodus. About a month prior to the release of The Legacy, the band changed their name to Testament after finding out that there was a jazz band named Legacy. The Testament name was suggested by Billy Milano (from S.O.D. and M.O.D.), who was a friend of the band in the early days.Sunday Old School: Testament Metal Underground (retrieved 21 May 2012) This was the only Testament album to feature songwriting contributions from Souza, who was credited as the co-writer of all the songs, except for \\"C.O.T.L.O.D.\\" and \\"Do or Die\\", which were co-written by original Legacy singer Derrick Ramirez and Billy respectively. The closing track, \\"Apocalyptic City\\", was written by Skolnick and Peterson. The album was recorded and mixed at Pyramid Sound Studios in Ithaca, New York, and mastered at Frankford Wayne Mastering Labs in New York City. Touring and promotion In support of The Legacy, Testament went on a worldwide tour from June 1987 to April 1988. During the American leg of their tour, they were the opening act for Anthrax on the Among the Living tour, toured through the South and the East Coast with Overkill and played two shows in Northern California with Megadeth. After an appearance at Dynamo Open Air in June 1987 (recorded for the live EP Live at Eindhoven), Testament embarked on their first tour of Europe as the opening act for Anthrax. Touring for The Legacy ended in April 1988, shortly before the release of The New Order. Reception and awards The Legacy received favorable reviews by music critics. AllMusic's Alex Henderson rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, and said that it saw Testament earn respect in \\"thrash circles\\" and called it \\"a relentlessly heavy and promising effort focusing on such subjects as the occult, witchcraft, nuclear war, and global destruction.\\" Henderson also praised Alex Perialas' production on The Legacy as \\"superb -- well respected in metal circles\\", and added that Perialas had \\"obviously encouraged Testament to play hard and let it rip.\\" Within three years after its release in 1987, The Legacy had sold over 150,000 copies in the U.S. The album was also included on 'Frank's Favorite Records of 1987' on Metal Injection, and was ranked at number three on Loudwire's top ten list of \\"Thrash Albums NOT Released by the Big 4\\".

Biography K√°lnoky was born in Letovice (Lettowitz), Moravia to an old Transylvanian family which had held comital rank in Hungary from the 17th century. After spending some years in a hussar regiment, in 1854 he entered the diplomatic service without giving up his connection with the army, in which he reached the rank of general in 1879. He was for the ten years (1860‚Äì1870) secretary of embassy at London, and then, after serving at Rome and Copenhagen, was in 1880 appointed ambassador at St. Petersburg. His success in Russia procured for him, on the death of Baron Heinrich Karl von Haymerle in 1881, the appointment of minister of foreign affairs for Austria-Hungary, a post which he held for fourteen years. Essentially a diplomatist, he took little or no part in the vexed internal affairs of the Dual Monarchy, and he came little before the public except at the annual statement on foreign affairs before the Delegations. His management of the affairs of his department was, however, very successful; he confirmed and maintained the alliance with Germany, which had been formed by his predecessors, and co-operated with Bismarck in the arrangements by which Italy joined the alliance. K√°lnoky's special influence was seen in the improvement of Austrian relations with Russia, following on the meeting of the three emperors in September 1884 at Skierniewice, at which he was present. His Russophile policy caused some adverse criticism in Hungary. His friendliness for Russia did not, however, prevent him from strengthening the position of Austria as against Russia in the Balkan Peninsula by the establishment later of a closer political and commercial understanding with Serbia and Romania. In 1885 he interfered after the battle of Slivnitsa to arrest the advance of the Bulgarians on Belgrade, but he lost influence in Serbia after the abdication of King Milan. Though he kept aloof from the Clerical party, K√°lnoky was a strong Catholic; and his sympathy for the difficulties of the Church caused adverse comment in Italy, when, in 1891, he stated in a speech before the Delegations that the question of the position of the Pope was still unsettled. He subsequently explained that by this he did not refer to the Roman question, which was permanently settled, but to the possibility of the Pope leaving Rome. The jealousy felt in Hungary against the Ultramontanes led to his fall. In 1895 a case of clerical interference in the internal affairs of Hungary by the nuncio Antonio Agliardi aroused a strong protest in the Hungarian parliament, and consequent differences between Dezs≈ë B√°nffy, the Hungarian minister, and the minister for foreign affairs led to K√°lnoky's resignation. He died in Brodek u Prostƒõjova (Pr√∂dlitz). He was awarded the Serbian order of Order of the Cross of Takovo.

If only two parameters from the complete blood count are low, the term bicytopenia can be used. The diagnostic approach is the same as for pancytopenia.  Causes  Iatrogenic causes of pancytopenia include chemotherapy for malignancies if the drug or drugs used cause bone marrow suppression. Rarely, drugs (antibiotics, blood pressure medication, heart medication) can cause pancytopenia. The antibiotics Linezolid and Chloramphenicol can cause pancytopenia in some individuals. Rarely, pancytopenia may have other causes, such as mononucleosis or other viral diseases. Increasingly, HIV is itself a cause of pancytopenia. * Familial hemophagocytic syndrome * Aplastic anemia * Gaucher's disease * Metastatic carcinoma of bone * Multiple Myeloma * Overwhelming infections * Lymphoma * Myelofibrosis * Dyskeratosis congenita * Myelodysplastic syndrome * Leukemia * Leishmaniasis * Severe folate or vitamin B12 deficiency * Systemic lupus erythematosus * Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (blood test) * Viral infections (such as HIV, EBV; an undetermined virus is most common) * Alimentary toxic aleukia * Copper deficiency * Pernicious anemia * Medication * Hypersplenism * Osteopetrosis * Organic acidurias (Propionic Acidemia, Methylmalonic Aciduria, Isovaleric Aciduria) * Low dose arsenic poisoning * Sako disease (Myelodysplastic-cytosis) * Chronic radiation sickness * LIG4 syndrome  Mechanism The mechanisms for pancytopenia differ according to the etiology. For example, in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) there is marked inappropriate and ineffective T cell activation that leads to an increased hemophagocytic activity. The T cell activated macrophages engulf erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, as well as their progenitor cells. Along with pancytopenia, HLH is characterized by fever, splenomegaly, and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, liver, or lymph nodes.  Diagnosis  Pancytopenia usually requires a bone marrow biopsy in order to distinguish among different causes. * anemia: hemoglobin < 13.5 g/dL (male) or 12 g/dL (female). * leukopenia: total white cell count < 4.0 x 109/L.

James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62 From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey The word \\"landscape\\" itself combines \\"land\\" with a verb of Germanic origin, \\"scapjan/schaffen\\" to mean, literally, \\"shaped lands\\".HABER, W (1995) Concept, Origin, and Meaning of Landscape. UNESCO's Cultural Landscapes of Universal Value: Components of a Global Strategy. UNESCO, New York. Pages 38-42. Lands were then considered shaped by natural forces, and the unique details of such landshaffen (shaped lands) became themselves the subject of 'landscape' paintings. The geographer Otto Schl√ºter is credited with having first formally used ‚Äúcultural landscape‚Äù as an academic term in the early 20th century.JAMES, P.E & MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley & Sons. New York, p.177. In 1908, Schl√ºter argued that by defining geography as a Landschaftskunde (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.ELKINS, T.H (1989) Human and Regional Geography in the German- speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas & BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27 He defined two forms of landscape: the Urlandschaft (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the Kulturlandschaft (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes. It was Carl O. Sauer, a human geographer, who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.JAMES, P.E & MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley & Sons. New York. Page 321-324. Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth's surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.SAUER, C (1925) The Morphology of Landscape. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53 His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows: > \\"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a cultural > group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural > landscape is the result\\" Since Schl√ºter's first formal use of the term, and Sauer's effective promotion of the idea, the concept of 'cultural landscapes has been variously used, applied, debated, developed and refined within academia. In the 1950s, for instance, J.B. Jackson and his publication 'Landscape' influenced a generation of particularly American scholars, including architectural historians Denise Scott Brown, and Gwendolyn Wright. By 1992, the World Heritage Committee elected to convene a meeting of the 'specialists' to advise and assist redraft the Committee's Operational Guidelines to include 'cultural landscapes' as an option for heritage listing properties that were neither purely natural nor purely cultural in form (i.e. 'mixed' heritage).FOWLER, P.J (2003) World Heritage Cultural Landscapes 1992 - 2002. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris, France. The World Heritage Committee's adoption and use of the concept of 'cultural landscapes' has seen multiple specialists around the world, and many nations identifying 'cultural landscapes', assessing 'cultural landscapes', heritage listing 'cultural landscapes', managing 'cultural landscapes', and effectively making 'cultural landscapes' known and visible to the world, with very practical ramifications and challenges. A 2006 academic review of the combined efforts of the World Heritage Committee, multiple specialists around the world, and nations to apply the concept of 'cultural landscapes', observed and concluded that: > \\"Although the concept of landscape has been unhooked for some time from its > original art associations ... there is still a dominant view of landscapes > as an inscribed surface, akin to a map or a text, from which cultural > meaning and social forms can simply be read.\\"PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling > Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage > List. James Cook University, Cairns. Page 63 Within academia, any system of interaction between human activity and natural habitat is regarded as a cultural landscape. In a sense this understanding is broader than the definition applied within UNESCO, including, as it does, almost the whole of the world's occupied surface, plus almost all the uses, ecologies, interactions, practices, beliefs, concepts, and traditions of people living within cultural landscapes. Following on this, geographer Xo√°n Paredes defines cultural landscape as: > \\"... the environment modified by the human being in the course of time, the > long-term combination between anthropic action on this environment and the > physical constraints limiting or conditioning human activity. It is a > geographical area ‚Äì including natural and cultural resources ‚Äì associated to > historical evolution, which gives way to a recognizable landscape for a > particular human group, up to the point of being identifiable as such by > others.\\"PAREDES, X.M.

Unlike the seven provinces Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel, Friesland and Groningen, these territories had no States-Provincial and were not represented in the central government. From an economic point of view, they were exploited with heavy taxes and levies. As one author puts it: \\"Back in the Dutch lap, these so-called Generality countries were for a long time governed as a sort of internal colonies, in which Catholics were seen as second-class citizens.\\" History 300pxthumbThe Dutch Republic 1715‚Äì1785. During the Eighty Years' War the Generality Lands came under control of the Dutch Republic, and this situation was consolidated by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Most of the territories had no provincial government because they were cut off from their original governments, which remained under Spanish rule. The prefix Staats- indicates that this part of the province was under general States rule, as a dependent territory. For both the Generality Lands and the Dutch colonies, sovereignty was claimed by the Generality on the basis right of conquest. *Brabant of the States (Staats- Brabant): the northern part of the Duchy of Brabant, most of the present province of North Brabant *Flanders of the States (Staats-Vlaanderen): the northern part of the County of Flanders, present Zeelandic Flanders and nowadays part of the province of Zeeland *Overmaas of the States (Staats- Overmaas): several small territories between Maastricht, Li√®ge and Aachen, e.g. Dalhem, Valkenburg and Hertogenrade. The city of Maastricht was a condominium of the United Provinces and the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. Overmaas literally means \\"beyond the Meuse\\" or \\"Trans-Meuse\\" (from the perspective of Brussels). The 19th century term \\"Staats-Limburg\\", invented for nationalistic reasons, is historically and geographically incorrect. *Upper Guelders of the States (Staats-Opper-Gelre): as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) a part of Spanish Guelders was ceded to the United Provinces, e.g. Venlo and Echt; another part came to Prussia and a small part around Roermond was left for the Austrian duchy of Guelders. *Westerwolde and Wedde: what is now the south-eastern part of the province of Groningen was a generality land between 1594 and 1619, after which it became part of said province. After the French occupation of the Southern Netherlands and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic in 1795 the Generality Lands ceased to exist. Staats-Brabant became a d√©partement in the Batavian Republic (Bataafs- Brabant). Staats-Vlaanderen became part of the French d√©partement Escaut. Staats-Overmaas and Staats-Opper-Gelre became parts of the Frenchs d√©partements Roer and Meuse-Inf√©rieure. When French rule ended and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands began, none of the Generality lands returned. Bataafs-Brabant was merged with a number of formerly semi-independent Holy Roman fiefs and part of the province of Holland to become the province of Noord-Brabant; Staats-Vlaanderen was incorporated into the province of Zeeland; and most parts of Staats-Opper-Gelre and Staats-Overmaas were merged with territories gained from Prussia to form the province of Limburg, with the rest going to Prussia. Territories of the Dutch Republic outside Europe were also under general States rule, for example Staten Island in present-day New York City. New Zealand was also originally called Staten Landt after its Dutch discovery.

He was most recently a professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University. He also created the Zelinsky Model of Demographic Transition. Background and education An Illinoisan by birth, but a \\"northeasterner by choice and conviction\\", Zelinsky received his education at University of California, Berkeley, where he was a student of Carl Sauer. He received his doctorate in 1953. Scholarship Zelinsky made numerous geographical studies of American popular culture, ranging from the diffusion of classical place-names to spatial patterns of personal given names and to the spatial patterning of religious denominations. One of his most ambitious and imaginative projects was a provocative assessment of the impact of increasingly powerful personal preference on the spatial character of American society. During the 1960s, along with Gordon DeJong, Warren Robinson, and Paul Baker, Zelinsky helped launch a population research center and coordinate an interdisciplinary graduate instructional program in population studies at Penn State and thus helped lay the foundation for what would become the dual-title Graduate Program in Demography. During 1972‚Äì1973 Zelinsky served as the first Director of the Population Issues Research Center (what would become the Population Research Institute at Penn State).Population Research Institute website http://www.pop.psu.edu/news/2013/zelinsky In 1973, Zelinsky published The Cultural Geography of the United States. In addition to his research in popular culture, Zelinsky made substantial contributions in the fields of \\"population\\" and \\"folk geography\\".  Theory of First Effective Settlement  Zelinsky's Theory of First Effective Settlement was that the dominant culture of a nation is defined by the first settlers who came to an area who are able to effect a self-perpetuating society. It was first stated by Wilbur Zelinsky in 1973. The theory states that these first settlers have significant impact on the social and cultural geography of the area, however small these first settlers may have been. They lay the groundwork for the following generations and are perhaps more important than the contributions of thousands of new immigrants a few generations later. Colin Woodard further expands upon this theory in his book, American Nations.

The group was most successful during the 1980s and is best known for their cover of Norman Greenbaum's \\"Spirit in the Sky\\" which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The band currently performs with a newer and established line- up. As well as previously being classed a tribute act to various artists, they are including many of their original songs in their live set. The group's musical style includes neo-psychedelia, glam rock, new wave and pop rock. Career The Doctor and lead singer (Clive Jackson, born 7 July 1961 in Knotty Ash, Liverpool), a former London-based DJ, formed the group in 1981 with guitarist Steve McGuire, drummer Vom (aka Steve Ritchie), and bassist Richard Searle and female dancers and singers The Anadin Brothers. The group adopted a look inspired by both 1960s psychedelia and kabuki make-up similar to that of Kiss. Their first single was \\"The Druids Are Here\\" which was released on Whaam Records in 1982. They released no further records until 1985, but a four-track EP recorded live at Alice in Wonderland, a Soho nightclub where The Doctor was house DJ, was available direct from the band. The band's female backing singers, known as The Anadin Brothers, were originally three in number, but reduced to two members - Wendi West and Colette Appleby. Melissa Weekes and The Doctor performing in June 2014 In 1985, they signed to IRS Records and released \\"Happy but Twisted\\", a five track 12\\" EP including a cover of Hawkwind's \\"Silver Machine\\". This reached number 2 on the indie charts. It was followed by \\"The Miracle of the Age\\", produced by Andy Partridge of XTC. Around this time the band performed a concert in a television studio in Limehouse, London was recorded for television broadcast, although it was not shown at the time. At this concert the line-up was augmented by Roman Jugg of The Damned on keyboards and second guitar. In 1986 the band had an international hit with their next single, a cover of Norman Greenbaum's \\"Spirit in the Sky\\". The single reached number one in the UK. Their subsequent singles were less successful; \\"Burn\\" and \\"Waterloo\\" (the latter of which was a cover of the ABBA hit, with Roy Wood on saxophone, backing vocals and in the video). \\"Burn\\" reached number 29 in the UK Singles Chart and \\"Waterloo\\" reached number 45. The band released their final studio album Instant Heaven, in 1996 on their own 'Madman' record label. In the early 2000s, the band's current line-up appeared on retro-themed British TV shows such as ITV1's Hit Me Baby One More Time, and a Top of the Pops Christmas special celebrating 50 years of the UK Singles Chart. In June 2006, the band appeared, with a new line-up, on Channel 4's Bring Back One Hit Wonders. Around this time they released an EP called Timewarped. They continue to perform live.

Evidently introduced by Pope Zachary around the middle of the 8th century,Joseph Gignac, \\"Anathema\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) the rite was once used by the Roman Catholic Church.  Ritual  The Excommunication of Robert the Pious (1875) by Jean-Paul Laurens The ceremony was described in the Pontificale Romanum until the time of the Second Vatican Council. Subsequent post-conciliar editions of the Pontificale omitted mention of any particular solemnities associated with excommunication. The ceremony traditionally involved a bishop, with 12 priests bearing candles, and would solemnly be pronounced in some suitably conspicuous place. The bishop would then pronounce the formula of the anathema, which ends with the following words: In English: After this recitation the priests would respond: Fiat, fiat, fiat (\\"So be it! So be it! So be it!\\") The bishop would then ring a bell, close a holy book, and he and the assisting priests would snuff out their candles by dashing them to the ground. However, the rite of anathema as described in the Pontificale Romanum only prescribes that the candles be dashed to the ground. After the ritual, written notices would be sent to the neighbouring bishops and priests to report that the target had been anathematized and why, so that they and their constituents would hold no communication with the target. The frightful pronouncements of the ritual were calculated so as to strike terror into the ones so excommunicated and bring them to repentance. This form of excommunication was inflicted on Robert II of France by Pope Gregory V for his marriage to Bertha of Burgundy in the year 996, because Bertha was his cousin. He was later reconciled with the Church after negotiations with Gregory's successor Pope Silvester II.Lea, Henry C.: Studies in Church History: The Rise of the Temporal Power, pp. 339ff, Sampson Low, Son, & Marston, 1869.  Cultural references  Shakespeare uses the phrase in King John. In Act 3, Philip Faulconbridge says \\"Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back, When gold and silver becks me to come on.\\" The dramatic nature of the ritual has lent itself to frequent depictions in culture and media. It is referenced directly in the title of the 1958 film Bell, Book and Candle, based on the play by John Van Druten. Bell, Book & Candle is the name of an antiquities store in the West Village section of New York City. The ceremony was also dramatised and popularised in the 1964 film, Becket, in which Archbishop Thomas Becket (played by Richard Burton) excommunicates Lord Gilbert. In The Rolling Stones song ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù from their 1973 album Goats Head Soup is the lyric But I been burnin‚Äô my bell, book and candle. The store owned by the main character in The Good Witch film and television series is named Bell, Book, & Candle. A similar ceremony is featured in the roguelike computer game NetHack. The board game Betrayal at House on the Hill, where a group of adventurers explore a haunted house, features items the explorers can use. Three of which are the Bell, Book, and Candle, and when one owns the three simultaneously they confer a significant benefit to the player. In the 1985 computer role playing game, Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, the Stranger must find the Bell of Courage, the Book of Truth, and the Candle of Love in order to enter the Abyss, the final dungeon of the game. In the 2019 TV series Good Omens, the witch finder Newton Pulsifer is presented with a bell, a book, and a candle (along with other objects), before he goes off to face the witch Anathema Device.

Spike Jones version Spike Jones' parody of the song is essentially the straight song with most of the parody being in the way the song is presented, in three parts: #A slow, deliberate rendering of the first half of the song, with vocal by Carl Grayson, in a style imitating The Ink Spots. #A spoken rendering of the second half of the song, by Red Ingle, with elaborations (\\"honey child, honey doll, honey lamb, honey pie\\") in a style reminiscent of The Ink Spots's bass singer Orville \\"Hoppy\\" Jones. #A frantically paced reiteration of the full song, in \\"Dixieland\\" style, with vocal again by Carl Grayson, accompanied by shotguns and other typical Jonesian sound effects. Harry Mills of the Mills Brothers reported not being bothered by the parody, since they were under the same management as Jones and were good friends.

Other brigades might have an artillery component, but an artillery brigade is a brigade dedicated to artillery and relying on other units for infantry support, especially when attacking. Initially, a brigade was normally formed for either offence or defence, but in the 20th century, as warfare became generally more mobile and fixed fortifications became less useful, artillery brigades were formed for either purpose, the main exception being coastal defence. During the Second World War, the use and formation of artillery brigades (normally having between 3,000 and 4,000 personnel, with between 24 and 70 guns) gained prominence, as they could be attached to divisions that needed them, then detached and re-attached elsewhere as the need arose. A specialised type of artillery brigade is the anti-aircraft brigade. During the Second World War, many anti-aircraft brigades served both to defend from air attack and as offensive units against armoured vehicles - this was especially true with the effective German artillery. Modern artillery brigades tend to be smaller and even more specialised than in the past, often specifically trained to handle just one or two types of artillery. In tactical terms, the use of helicopters has taken over much of the historic advantage of the artillery brigade. Royal Artillery From 1859 to 1938, \\"brigade\\" (\\"brigade-division\\" 1885‚Äì1903) was also the term used for a battalion-sized unit of the British Army's Royal Artillery. This was because, unlike infantry battalions and cavalry regiments, which were organic, artillery units consisted of individually numbered batteries which were \\"brigaded\\" together. The commanding officer of such a brigade was a lieutenant colonel. In 1938 the Royal Artillery adopted the term \\"regiment\\" for this size of unit, and \\"brigade\\" became used in its normal sense, particularly for groups of anti-aircraft artillery regiments commanded by a brigadier.Maj-Gen Sir John Headlam, The History of the Royal Artillery, Vol II (1899‚Äì1914), Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1937. Artillery Division Specialised artillery divisions came in vogue in the Soviet Army during the later stages of the Second World War, and it is mostly used by large armies with large territories to defend and with a large manpower base. Examples include 34th Artillery Division and 51st Guards Artillery Division. Artillery Divisions are usually tasked with providing concentrated firepower support to higher combined arms formations such as Corps, Combatant Commands or Theaters. Artillery divisions have later been taken up by the Indian Army since 1988 (two Artillery Divisions), the Iraqi Army for a short time between 1985 and 1998, and by the PAVN between 1971 and 2006. The concept of the Artillery Division is deeply rooted in Soviet military doctrine relies on treating artillery as a unique combat arm in its own right capable of achieving large results with its resources. It is a means to concentrate overwhelming firepower in a small geographical area to achieve a strategic breach in the enemy defences.

The Grand Mesa is a large mesa in western Colorado in the United States. It is the largest flat-topped mountain in the world.National Geographic Encyclopedia (2016) It has an area of about and stretches for about east of Grand Junction between the Colorado River and the Gunnison River, its tributary to the south. The north side of the mesa is drained largely by Plateau Creek, a smaller tributary of the Colorado. The west side is drained largely by Kannah Creek, which is received to the west by the lower Gunnison River. The mesa rises about above the surrounding river valleys, including the Grand Valley to the west, reaching an elevation of about . Much of the mesa is within Grand Mesa National Forest. Over 300 lakes, including many reservoirs created and used for drinking and irrigation water, are scattered along the top of the formation. The Grand Mesa is flat in some areas, but quite rugged in others. Geology The mesa is topped by a hard volcanic basalt. This layer, formed approximately 10 million years ago by basalt flows, suppressed erosion compared to the surrounding sedimentary rock layers, which suffered rapid downcutting from the action of the Colorado and the Gunnison rivers.Cole, R.; Weston, K. Geological Society of America Meeting Abstract (2007) The top layer rests on a thick sequence of Eocene shale and sandstone known as the Green River and Wasatch Formations. These layers in turn rest on a Cretaceous layer known as the Mesaverde Group that forms a cliff about halfway up the side of the mesa. The lowest layers are yellow and gray Mancos Shale of late Cretaceous age. The shale continues outward into the surrounding valleys in the vicinity of the mesa, providing a soil base that is fertile for various kinds of agriculture, especially in the Gunnison Valley to the south. Climate Climate on Grand Mesa varies by elevation. Higher elevations tend to be cooler and receive more precipitation. The top of the mesa is more than two miles above sea level, and experiences an alpine climate with substantial amounts of precipitation throughout the year. Because of the high altitude, summer days are mild, and temperatures drop sharply after sunset. Winter temperatures rarely rise above freezing, and can be extremely cold, often falling far below zero, especially at night. The top of the mesa is usually snow-free from late June through early October; however, the mesa receives heavy snowfall in the winter, rendering the forest service roads impassable. Accumulations of 20 or 30 inches of snow in the winter are typical. Surrounding areas with lower elevation are warmer and more arid throughout the year. The following climate data is for Mesa Lakes Resort, located on the north slopes of the mesa at 9,800 feet above sea level, which experiences a subalpine climate (K√∂ppen Dfc). Geography The mesa is traversed by the Grand Mesa Scenic and Historic Byway, which includes SH 65, between the town of Mesa on the north and the town of Cedaredge on the south. The route over the mesa provides a dramatic contrast in landscape, climate and vegetation. On the north side, the road climbs the steep terrain near the Powderhorn Resort ski area. The forested top of the mesa remains snowbound much later in the spring than the surrounding valleys, and is a popular location for cross-country skiing and snowmobiling.

After opening in 1979, the Pyramid helped define the East Village drag and gay scenes of the 1980s. The club is located at 101 Avenue A in Manhattan.  History  101 Avenue A, built in 1876, location of the Club In the late 1970s and early '80s, when mega-clubs like Studio 54 and The Limelight, dominated New York nightlife, the struggling artists, actors, musicians, and drag queens who lived in the East Village created their own, more intimately- scaled scene. They began taking over some of the local dive bars, such as the Holiday on St. Mark's Place, and created new clubs where there previously were none, as was the case with Club 57 (in the basement of a church), and 8BC, on a block of abandoned tenements. The club became a hangout for \\"a new breed of politicized drag performers\\" like Lypsinka, Lady Bunny, and RuPaul, whose first New York City show was at the Pyramid Club in 1982. On Labor Day 1985, Pyramid performer Lady Bunny hosted the Wigstock Festival in Tompkins Square Park. Andy Warhol and Debbie Harry dropped in the Pyramid to do a feature on the club for MTV, and Madonna appeared at her first AIDS benefit at the club. Both Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers played their first New York City concerts there. From 1992‚Äì95, Blacklips Performance Cult, a collective founded by Antony Hegarty, presented plays at Pyramid every Monday at midnight. In 2007, it was proposed that 101 Avenue A, the Pyramid Club's building, be landmarked. The proposal, described as the first \\"drag landmark\\", was not adopted by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC). However, in the spring of 2011 the LPC proposed a new historic district in the East Village focused around lower Second Avenue and encompassing 15 blocks and 330 buildings. The original proposal excluded buildings such as the Pyramid Club, but because of efforts made by local community groups, the proposed district was expanded to 101 Avenue A as well as other similar buildings. The LPC designated the club as part of the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District on October 9, 2012.

El Panecillo (from Spanish panecillo small piece of bread, diminutive of pan bread) is a 200-metre-high hill of volcanic-origin, with loess soil, located between southern and central Quito. Its peak is at an elevation of 3,016 metres (9,895ft) above sea level. The original name used by the aboriginal inhabitants of Quito was Yavirac. According to Juan de Velasco, a Jesuit historian, there was a temple on top of Yavirac where the Indians worshiped the sun until it was destroyed by the Spanish conquistadores. The street that leads up to El Panecillo is named after Melchor Aymerich. Statue Virgen de Quito In 1976, the Spanish artist Agust√≠n de la Herr√°n Matorras was commissioned by the religious order of the Oblates to build a 45-meter-tall stone monument of a madonna which was assembled on a high pedestal on the top of Panecillo. Called \\"Virgin of El Panecillo\\", it is made of seven thousand pieces of aluminium. The monument was inaugurated on March 28, 1976, by the 11th archbishop of Quito, Pablo Mu√±oz Vega. The statue was engineered and erected by Anibal Lopez of Quito. The virgin stands on top of a globe and is stepping on a snake, which is a classic madonna iconography. Less traditional are the wings. Locals claim that she is the only one in the world with wings like an angel. The monument was inspired by the famous \\"Virgen de Quito\\" (Quito's Madonna) also known as \\"the dancer\\" sculpted by Bernardo de Legarda in 1734, which now decorates the main altar at the Church of St. Francis. This madonna represents a turning point of the Quito School of Art (one of the most renowned of the Americas) because it shows a virgin in movement that is practically dancing in contrast with the traditional static Madonnas that were produced during the 18th century. According to a bronze placard affixed to the monument, the woman represented by the statue is the Woman of the Apocalypse, as described in the Book of Revelation (12:1-18).

He was born in Hartford, Connecticut and studied law at Georgetown University.  Career in law  He represented many high-profile clients, including Sam Giancana, John Hinckley, Jr., Frank Sinatra, former Governor of Texas & Secretary of Treasury John B. Connally, Jr., financier Robert Vesco, Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner, spy Igor Melekh, Jimmy Hoffa, organized crime figure Frank Costello, oil commodity trader Marc Rich, U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, corporate raider Victor Posner, Michael Milken, The Washington Post newspaper and the Reverend Sun Myung Moon. Williams, who was a graduate of the College of the Holy Cross and Georgetown University Law Center, successfully defended ‚Äì among others ‚Äì Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., the Teamsters Union, John Connally and, as one of his last clients, Michael Milken. Two of Williams' closest friends were The Washington Post's Art Buchwald and Ben Bradlee. His debating team partner at Holy Cross was Robert Maheu, Howard Hughes's right-hand man for many years. Before establishing Williams & Connolly in 1967 with his friend and student Paul Connolly, he worked at the prominent, D.C.-based law firm of Hogan & Hartson from 1945 to 1949.  Deep Throat  In one of the definitive biographies on Williams, author Evan Thomas wrote: \\"Because of his connections and his vast store of inside knowledge, some observers speculated that he was Deep Throat, the legendary source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the resourceful Post reporters who broke the story tying the White House to the break-in.\\" It was later revealed that the anonymous source known as Deep Throat was FBI associate director Mark Felt.  Professional sports  Williams entered the world of professional sports as a lawyer for Washington Redskins founding owner George Preston Marshall in the late-1950s. He ascended the administrative ranks by purchasing a five percent share in the franchise in March 1962 and succeeding the ailing Marshall as team president in charge of daily operations three years later in 1965. Williams spent heavily on appointing high-profile coaches and general managers, beginning with Otto Graham in 1966 and continuing with Vince Lombardi in 1969, George Allen in 1971 and Bobby Beathard in 1978. A defeat in Super Bowl VII was the farthest the Redskins ever advanced in any of the seasons under Williams' watch. He relinquished control of the ballclub in 1980 and sold his minority ownership interest five years later in 1985, in both cases to Jack Kent Cooke who had been the team's majority owner since 1974.Richman, Michael.

To him geopolitics is the planning of the security policy of a country in terms of its geographical factors. He described the maritime fringe of a country or continent; in particular the densely populated western, southern, and eastern edges of the Eurasian continent. He criticized Mackinder for overrating the Heartland as being of immense strategic importance due to its vast size, central geographical location and supremacy of land power rather than sea power. He assumed that the Heartland will not be a potential hub of Europe, because: # Western Russia was then an agrarian society # Bases of industrialization were found to the west of the Ural mountains. # This area is ringed to the north, east, south, and south-west by some of the greater obstacles to transportation (ice and freezing temperature, lowering mountains etc.). # There has never really been a simple land power‚Äìsea power opposition. Spykman thought that the Rimland, the strip of coastal land that encircles Eurasia, is more important than the central Asian zone (the so-called Heartland) for the control of the Eurasian continent. Spykman's vision is at the base of the \\"containment politics\\" put into effect by the United States in its relation/position to the Soviet Union during the post-World War II period. Thus, 'Heartland' appeared to him to be less important in comparison to 'Rimland.' Concept According to Spykman, \\"Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia, who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.\\" The Rimland, Halford Mackinder's \\"Inner or Marginal Crescent\\", was divided into three sections: * The European coast land; * The Arabian-Middle Eastern desert land; and, * The Asiatic monsoon land. Rimland or inner crescent contains most of world's people as well as large share of world's resources. Rimland is in between Heartland and marginal seas, so it was more important than Heartland. It included Asia minor, Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, South East Asia, China, Korea and East Siberia except Russia. All the aforesaid countries lie in the buffer zone that is between sea power and land power. Rimland countries were amphibian states, surrounding the Eurasian continents. While Spykman accepts the first two as defined, he rejects the simple grouping of the Asian countries into one \\"monsoon land.\\" India, the Indian Ocean littoral, and Indian culture were geographically and civilizationally separate from the Chinese lands. The Rimland's defining characteristic is that it is an intermediate region, lying between the heartland and the marginal sea powers. As the amphibious buffer zone between the land powers and sea powers, it must defend itself from both sides, and therein lies its fundamental security problems. Spykman's conception of the Rimland bears greater resemblance to Alfred Thayer Mahan's \\"debated and debatable zone\\" than to Mackinder's inner or marginal crescent. The Rimland has great importance coming from its demographic weight, natural resources, and industrial development. Spykman sees this importance as the reason that the Rimland will be crucial to containing the Heartland (whereas Mackinder had believed that the Outer or Insular Crescent would be the most important factor in the Heartland's containment). Applicability He called for the consolidation of the Rimland countries to ensure their survival during World War II. With the defeat of Germany and the emergence of the USSR, Spykman's views were embraced during the formulation of the Cold War American policy of containing communist influence. But as the states within the Rimland had varying degree of independence, and a variety of races, and culture, it did not come under the control of any single power. Criticism * It was a self- fulfilling prophecy. * In his concept of air power he did not include the use of modern missiles with nuclear war heads. * The Rimland is not a region but a unit, otherwise the epitome of geographical diversity. * The Rimland-Theory is biased towards Asian countries. * The Rimland-Theory does not take into account the various conflicts going on between its different countries (India vs. Pakistan, etc.) See also * Theory of Heartland * Core‚Äìperiphery Further reading * Category:Political terminology of the United States Category:Geopolitics ","title":"Rimland"},{"id":"1883683","text":"Indolence means lack of activity and may refer to: * Laziness of people and living beings * A sign of benignity in histopathology of tumors See also * Indolent (disambiguation) ","title":"Indolence"},{"id":"1883685","text":":For the Italian city, see Silanus.

Biography=Early life and family George L. Stearns was born in Medford, Massachusetts on January 8, 1809, the eldest son and second child of Luther and Mary (Hall) Stearns. His paternal immigrant ancestor, Isaac Sterne, arrived in Salem on June 12, 1630, from Suffolk, England. He had sailed to the new colony with John Winthrop, a future governor, and Sir Richard Saltonstall, among others. Isaac Sterne moved to Watertown, located along the Charles River, where he died in 1671. What became known as the American Stearns family (note spelling variation) grew, with branches moving northward and westward. For decades men typically worked as farmers, teachers, and clergymen. Stearns' father, Luther Stearns, was born on February 17, 1770, the eldest of five children born to Captain Josiah Stearns, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. He commanded a company of 50 men from Lunenburg, Massachusetts. Luther Stearns had entered Dartmouth College at age seventeen but transferred, graduating from Harvard in 1791. He worked as a tutor at Harvard and eventually studied medicine. He later became an obstetrician. He was honored in 1811 by an honorary degree from Harvard. After getting his practice started, Luther married Mary Hall of Brattleboro, Vermont, on December 29, 1799; she was 16 years old, not an uncommon marrying age for women. They settled in Medford, Massachusetts to be closer to her relatives. They had three children together: Elizabeth Hall, George Luther, and Henry Laurens Stearns (named after the American Ambassador of that name, a distant relative). The senior Stearns later opened a private preparatory school for boys in Medford; many students came from the American South and the West Indies. Stearns died of pneumonia on April 27, 1820, when son George was eleven years old. To earn money, young George sometimes tended the locks on the Middlesex Canal in town. At the age of 15, he entered the workforce to support his mother and sisters. Career In early life, Stearns was engaged in the business of ship-chandlery. After a prosperous career, he began the manufacture of sheet and pipe-lead, doing business in Boston and residing in Medford. He married Mary Elizabeth Preston on October 12, 1843. They met through acquaintances, including her father Warren Preston, a probate judge in Norridgewock, Maine; and Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist and women's rights activist. Before voting in the Missouri and Kansas territories about the future of slavery in each jurisdiction, Stearns was one of the chief financiers of the Emigrant Aid Company. It supported the settlement of Kansas by antislavery homesteaders. He identified with the antislavery cause, and became a Free-soiler in 1848. He also established the Medford station of the Underground Railroad to help escaped refugee slaves to gain freedom (some continued to Canada, which had abolished slavery). Stearns was one of the \\"Secret Six\\" who aided John Brown in Kansas, and financially supported him for the raid on Harpers Ferry; Brown was executed for this attack. Stearns had owned the pikes and 200 Sharps rifles taken to Harpers Ferry by Brown and his followers. Following Brown's arrest, Stearns briefly fled to Canada but returned to Medford to face inquiry following Brown's execution. Soon after the opening of the Civil War, Stearns advocated the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. Massachusetts Governor John Andrew asked Stearns to recruit the first two Northern state-sponsored black infantry regiments. He contributed strongly to recruiting the enlistees of the 54th and 55th Massachusetts regiments and the 5th cavalry. Stearns was commissioned as major through the recommendation of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Later he also enlisted black soldiers for the U.S. Colored Troops from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee. He is credited with recruiting more than 13,000 African Americans. He also established schools for their children and found work for their families while the men served in the army. Stearns founded the Nation, Commonwealth, and Right Way newspapers for the dissemination of his ideas.James M. McPherson, The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction, Princeton University Press, 1964/new edition 2015 After President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Stearns worked tirelessly for the civil rights of African Americans. Among his many admirers and friends were Louisa May Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Sumner, Frederick Douglass, and President Andrew Johnson. He also helped to found the Freedmen's Bureau, a federal organization designed to support emancipated African Americans (freedmen) in the South after the end of the war. Death and legacy Stearns died of pneumonia in New York City, New York on April 9, 1867. Ralph Waldo Emerson gave the eulogy at his funeral at the First Parish Church in Medford (Unitarian). Writer John Greenleaf Whittier published a poem in honor of Stearns in the May 1867 edition of the Atlantic Monthly, entitled \\"G.L.S.\\" It read, in part: \\"No duty could overtask him; No need his will outrun; Or ever our lips could ask him; His hands the work had done.\\" \\"A man who asked not to be great; But as he served and saved the state.\\" In 1897, a monument was erected on Boston Common to commemorate Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts regiment he commanded. Together with 20 of his men, he was killed in July 1863 in the Second Battle of Fort Wagner. At the dedication of the monument, Booker T. Washington, President of Tuskegee Institute, made an address. He attributed the organization and recruiting of the US Colored Troops to be the work \\"of John A. Andrew ... and that of George L. Stearns, who, with hidden generosity and a great sweet heart, helped to turn the darkest hour into day, and in doing so freely gave service, fortune and life itself to the cause which this day commemorates.\\" \\"Exercises at the Dedication of the Monument to Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the Fifty-fourth Regiment of Massachusetts Infantry,\\" May 31, 1897, Boston: Boston City Council, 1897. Following this commemoration, Joseph H. Smith, a veteran of the 54th, started a movement to have a commemorative tablet placed in the Statehouse at Boston, to honor Major Stearns' services. The resolution was passed in 1897 to place a tablet in Memorial Hall or other establishments in Boston and signed by Governor Wolcott. It was not enacted at the time, but a second resolution was passed in 1901 by the Massachusetts legislature to authorize it. The tablet is entitled: \\"In Memoriam George Luther Stearns\\" and says, in part: A merchant of Boston Who illustrated in his life and character The nobility and generosity of Citizenship Giving his life and fortune for The overthrow of slavery and the Preservation of free institutions To his unresting devotion and unfailing hope Massachusetts owes The fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth regiments of colored infantry, And the federal government ten thousand colored troops, At a critical moment in the great war. In the darkest hour of the republic His faith in the people never wavered. NotesReferences * Heller, Charles E., Portrait of an Abolitionist: A Biography of George Luther Stearns, 1809-1867.

It entered service in 1983. Design and development In the 1950s the Royal Navy was equipped with British designed and built Mk 30 air-dropped torpedoes. These were passive homing weapons which relied on detecting the noise from submarine targets. However, as submarine noise levels decreased these weapons became ineffective. A design for a British Mk 31 torpedo which would have used active echo-location sonar failed to receive Government approval for production. US Mk 44 torpedoes were purchased for the Royal Navy in the 1960s to fill this role, and later replaced by US Mk 46 torpedoes. A desire to not be dependent on US torpedo purchases led to a research programme starting in 1964 to develop a British torpedo. Initially designated Naval and Air Staff Requirement (NASR) 7511, it was (much later in the late 1970s) designated the Sting Ray torpedo. Design Design studies in the mid-1960s proposed that a tank of polyethylene oxide be carried behind the warhead. This polymer would be exuded at the nose to reduce the drag coefficient. Experiments using buoyancy-propelled torpedoes in 1969 had shown reductions in the drag coefficient up to 25%. However, by 1969 this scheme had been rejected in favour of carrying a larger battery. The homing system developed in the mid-1960s incorporated a spinning magnetic disc onto which the acoustic correlation algorithms were etched but this was replaced by integrated circuit technology when the disc sometimes failed to survive the impact of the weapon with the sea from high altitude launches. The original warhead concept was for a simple omnidirectional blast charge. However, studies in the 1970s showed that this would be inadequate against the large double-hulled submarines then entering service. A directed energy (shaped charge) warhead was used in the production weapon. In 1976 the designs had to be completely revised. Swapping the project for buying a ready-made US torpedo was not considered because the torpedo was expected to be better, and was all-British. The project manager was Eric Risness CBE. Manufacture The torpedo was built at the MSDS (later MUSL) plants at Neston (in Cheshire) and MUSL in Farlington and Waterlooville near Portsmouth. Guidance systems were made by Sperry Gyroscope Company. Deployment The original in-service version (Sting Ray Mod 0) is officially documented as entering service in 1983, although Mark Higgitt's book Through Fire and Water (2013), which tells the story of HMS Ardent during the Falklands conflict, states that operational Stingray torpedoes were transferred to the ship immediately prior to its sailing date of 19 April 1982 under conditions of great secrecy (pp. 56, 61). It is propelled by a pump jet driven by an electric motor. Power is supplied by a magnesium/silver-chloride sea water battery. The propulsion method combines high speed, deep diving, agility and low noise levels. The weapon is provided with target and environmental information by the launching platform. Once launched it operates autonomously, with tactical software searching for the target using active sonar and then homing in without any further assistance. The software is designed to deal with the employment of countermeasures by the target. The weapon is designed to be launched from fixed wing or rotary winged aircraft and surface ships against submarine targets. The development of the torpedo cost ¬£920 million. The Mark 24 Tigerfish submarine-launched torpedo had also overshot its initial budget.

They later paired up again voicing characters of best friends Teddy Ruxpin (Baron) and Grubby the Octopede (Ryan) in the Teddy Ruxpin book and tape series as well as the 1986‚Äì87 television show The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin. In August 2002, Willio and Phillio returned to Cleveland for two performances at historic Cain Park and another at the famed Beachland Ballroom. At the Cain Park show, friend Alec Nordstrom of Hudson was invited onstage. Cleveland's revered rock critic and \\"world's oldest teenager,\\" Jane Scott, attended and reviewed the Beachland performance for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The Willio and Phillio act brought Ryan back into music and after moving to California, he began to write and record songs for The Walt Disney Company. Willio and Phillio performed \\"I Wish it Could Be Christmas All Year Long\\" on a Disney Christmas album in a voice similar to Micky Dolenz of The Monkees. He provided the voices of Rabbit and Tigger, and the singing voice of Eeyore, in the Disney Channel's long-running series Welcome to Pooh Corner and in many other Pooh cartoons. He also provided the voice of Barnaby the Dog on the popular series Dumbo's Circus. In 1987, Ryan became a fixture of the radio drama Adventures in Odyssey, as Eugene Meltsner, Harlow Doyle, David Harley, Patrick O'Ryan and over 100 individual characters. He voiced Rabbit in Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore, Digit in An American Tail, Petrie in The Land Before Time, and Willie the Giant in Mickey's Christmas Carol. He continues to do voice work. In 2009, he was working on the third season of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, the 21st season of Adventures in Odyssey, and the new radio series of Will Ryan's Cactus County Round-Up which featured his band The Cactus County Cowboys. In the Family Guy episode \\"Road to the North Pole\\", he provided the voice for Winnie- the-Pooh. As a side project, with Andrew J. Lederer and Michael Rosenberg (Jackie Diamond), Will Ryan briefly performed in the '20s-style music and comedy trio The Merry Metronomes. He and Lederer also appeared from time to time as a duo, usually under the name The Natty Nabobs. He and Nick Santa Maria also perform occasionally as a vaudeville-era comedy team, Biffle & Shooster (Ryan plays the latter); and in 2013 they made their first film, a faux 1930s comedy short titled It's a Frame-Up!.

It consists of the surgical removal of any extent of the colon, usually segmental resection (partial colectomy). In extreme cases where the entire large intestine is removed, it is called total colectomy, and proctocolectomy (procto- + colectomy) denotes that the rectum is included. Indications Some of the most common indications for colectomy are: * Colon cancer * Diverticulitis and diverticular disease of the large intestine * Trauma * Inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Colectomy neither cures nor eliminates Crohn's disease, instead only removing part of the entire diseased large intestine. A colectomy is considered a \\"cure\\" for ulcerative colitis because the disease attacks only the large intestine and therefore will not be able to flare up again if the entire large intestine (cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon) and rectum are removed. However, it does not always take away extra-intestinal symptoms. * Prophylactic colectomy can be indicated in some forms of polyposis, Lynch syndrome and certain cases of inflammatory bowel disease because of high risk for development of colorectal cancer. * Bowel infarction * Typhlitis Basic principles Traditionally, colectomy is performed via an abdominal incision (laparotomy), though minimally invasive colectomy, by means of laparoscopy, is growing both in scope of indications and popularity, and is a well-established procedure in many medical centers. Recent experience has shown the feasibility of single port access colectomy. Resection of any part of the colon entails mobilization and ligation of the corresponding blood vessels. Lymphadenectomy is usually performed through excision of the fatty tissue adjacent to these vessels (mesocolon), in operations for colon cancer. When the resection is complete, the surgeon has the option of immediately restoring the bowel, by stitching or stapling together both the cut ends (primary anastomosis), or creating a colostomy. Several factors are taken into account, including: * Circumstances of the operation (elective vs emergency); In many cases, emergency resection of colon with anastomosis needs to be done and this carries a higher complication rate since proper bowel preparation is not possible in emergency situations * Disease being treated; (i.e., no colectomy surgery can cure Crohn's disease, because the disease usually recurs at the site where the healthy sections of the large intestine were joined together. For example, if a patient with Crohn's disease has a transverse colectomy, their Crohn's will usually reappear at the resection site of the ascending and descending colons.) * Acute physiological state of the patient; * Impact of living with a colostomy, albeit temporarily; * Use of a specific preoperative regimen of low residue diet and laxatives (so-called \\"bowel prep\\"). An anastomosis carries the risk of dehiscence (breakdown of the stitches), which can lead to contamination of the peritoneal cavity, peritonitis, sepsis and death. A number of factors may increase the risk of anastomotic dehiscence, either partial ('leak') or complete. Basic surgical principles include ensuring a good blood supply to the opposing ends, and a lack of tension at the join. The use of NSAIDS for analgesia following gastrointestinal surgery remains controversial, given mixed evidence of an increased risk of leakage from any bowel anastomosis created. This risk may vary according to the class of NSAID prescribed. Colostomy is always safer, but places a societal, psychological and physical burden on the patient. The choice is by no means an easy one and is rife with controversy, being a frequent topic of heated debate among surgeons all over the world. Types * Right hemicolectomy and left hemicolectomy refer to the resection of the ascending colon (right) and the descending colon (left), respectively. When part of the transverse colon is also resected, it may be referred to as an extended hemicolectomy. * Transverse colectomy is also possible, though uncommon. * Sigmoidectomy is a resection of the sigmoid colon, sometimes including part or all of the rectum (proctosigmoidectomy). When a sigmoidectomy is followed by terminal colostomy and closure of the rectal stump, it is called a Hartmann operation; this is usually done out of impossibility to perform a \\"double-barrel\\" or Mikulicz colostomy, which is preferred because it makes \\"takedown\\" (reoperation to restore normal intestinal continuity by means of an anastomosis) considerably easier. * When the entire colon is removed, this is called a total colectomy, also known as Lane's Operation. If the rectum is also removed, it is a total proctocolectomy. * Subtotal colectomy is resection of part of the colon or a resection of all of the colon without complete resection of the colon. Laparoscopic surgery As of 2012, more than 40% of colon resections in United States are performed via laparoscopic approach. History Sir William Arbuthnot-Lane was one of the early proponents of the usefulness of total colectomies, although his overuse of the procedure called the wisdom of the surgery into question.

It surrounds most of Calgary, forming the city's northern boundary and most of the city's western and eastern boundaries. At a population of 39,407 in 2016, Rocky View County is the most populous municipal district in Alberta. Though predominantly rural in nature, Rocky View County is home to 14 hamlets, including Langdon, one of Alberta's most populous hamlets. Its rural areas are home to numerous country residential subdivisions.  History  The Municipal District (MD) of Calgary No. 44 was originally formed on January 1, 1955 from part of Improvement District No. 46 and parts of five municipal districts - the MD of Serviceberry No. 43, the MD of Conrich No. 44, the MD of Springbank No. 45, the MD of Kneehill No. 48, and the MD of Mountain View No. 49. The MD of Calgary No. 44 was renamed the MD of Rocky View No. 44 on January 9, 1956. \\"Rocky View\\" was the successful entry selected in December 1955 in a local competition to rename the newly formed municipal district. The entry was submitted by Leslie Burwash of Balzac. \\"Bow View\\" and \\"Chinook\\" placed second and third respectively in the competition. The name \\"Rocky View\\" was successful due to its descriptive nature as most areas within the MD of Rocky View No. 44 have views of the Rocky Mountains to the west. The MD of Rocky View No. 44 changed its name to Rocky View County on June 24, 2009.

Portrayed by Hollywood veteran Eddie Albert, Oliver Wendell Douglas was a New York City attorney acting out his long-harbored dream of moving to the Midwest and operating a farm rather than practicing \\"big city\\" law. The character's name was inspired by famed Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and possibly also by then-Supreme Court justice William Orville Douglas.  Character biography  Oliver Wendell Douglas was a New York City attorney who had long harbored a dream of moving to the Midwest and operating a farm rather than practicing \\"big city\\" law. His wife, Lisa, a glamorous Hungarian immigrant (who was played by Eva Gabor), had absolutely no desire to leave sophisticated New York City for a backward, rural area. His idea also met with stringent resistance from his own mother, Eunice (Eleanor Audley), who sided with Lisa against leaving New York City for the hinterlands. However, once they actually arrived at their newly purchased farm (a run-down nightmare whose farmhouse was little more than a dilapidated shack), it was Lisa, not Oliver, who immediately fit into Hooterville and its weird collection of zany characters. Oliver had a high opinion of farmers in theory; he often made a speech in which he referred to \\"crops shooting up out of the ground\\" (which his wife, Lisa, in her Hungarian accent, repeated as \\"crops shoosting out of the ground\\") and other platitudes about rural life, which on the program was invariably accompanied by a background of patriotic music (Yankee Doodle to be exact); other characters frequently searched for the source of the music. Oliver was usually presented in the light of being the only sane character in an insane world; however, he, too, had his quirks, such as driving his tractor wearing the same three-piece suits that he had formerly worn to practice law and addressing nearly every other person in Hooterville as Mr. or Mrs., though the Hootervillians referred to each other by first names (although they apparently reciprocated by continuing to refer to him as \\"Mr. Douglas\\"). Oliver also was either too blinded by pride or too stubborn to admit that he was a totally incompetent failure as a farmer. He did not fit into a place where everyone took for granted that a \\"talking\\" pig, Arnold Ziffel, was his owners' \\"son\\", or where one of the two contractor \\"brothers\\" constantly remodelling his house was a woman, and somehow always lost out to local confidence man Mr. Haney, from whom he had bought the farm in the first place. He also hired the young Eb Dawson, who referred to Mr. and Mrs. Douglas as his parents and who often irritated Oliver. He is such a fanatic farmer wannabe in the pilot episode, that during a flashback while on a bombing mission in a P-38, he annoys his squadron commander with comments about how tomatoes are turned into catsup. A later episode shows Oliver was a Captain in USAF Reserves when the Hooterville townsfolk try to have him fly a broken down Curtiss JN-4 from World War I. Oliver's denial led him to labor on in vain, year after year, when it was obvious to everyone else that he would be far more successful back in his New York law practice. His wife Lisa, a very reluctant rural dweller initially, fits right into her new surroundings and is almost immediately accepted and befriended by nearly everyone. One running gag shows how Oliver usually \\"loses\\" one way or another to the Hooterville yokels. In one episode Mr Haney, Lisa, and Hank Kimball think they've discovered a \\"Milk-making\\" Machine. Oliver has to tell them (tongue- in-cheek) that not only are the chemicals so expensive that milk prices would soar- but that this new milk also causes baldness! One episode shows Oliver as a \\"successful\\" lawyer when he manages to convince the US Army not to draft Arnold Ziffel the Pig. At the end of the episode Oliver has a new client to keep from being drafted-\\"Ralph Monroe\\"! Despite being a horrible farmer and once only making 16 dollars of profit for the entire year, the Douglases never had to worry about money‚Äîfor instance, they never have trouble replacing the numerous dishes that Lisa breaks. This once caused the other residents to believe that Oliver was making and selling alcohol, and that he was involved with the mob. A running gag in later seasons of the show involved Oliver often never being able to finish something he starts to say due to being rudely interrupted by other characters in the scene at a particular moment.  Character creation  In the 1950 radio sitcom on which Green Acres was originally based, the character was a banker named John Granby and portrayed by Gale Gordon. Granby, in turn, was based on Gordon's character on My Favorite Husband. In a notable difference between the radio and television versions, Granby had a teenage daughter, which the Douglases did not.Dunning, John. (1976). Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925-1976. Prentice-Hall, Inc. . P. 244. The character's basic premise of a white-collar city man with passion but no talent for farming remained unchanged. The character's name was inspired by famed Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and possibly also by then-Supreme Court justice William Orville Douglas.

He has held this post since 2001, making him the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League. Early life Levy was born in Essex and is of Jewish origins. His father Barry Levy was the owner of a clothing retail business Mr Byrite (later rebranded as Blue Inc). He is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and attended his first match at White Hart Lane against QPR in the 1960s. He studied Economics and Land Economy at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and graduated in 1985 with a First Class Honours Degree.The Cambridge University List of Members up to 31 December 1988 Career After graduating, Levy went into his family business, Mr Byrite. He was also involved in property development, as well as a number of other businesses. He then formed a business association with Joe Lewis, and became involved in an investment trust called ENIC International Ltd that specialised in sports (football in particular), entertainment and media. He was made the managing director of ENIC in 1995. Levy and his family own 29.4% of the share capital of ENIC, while Lewis owns 70.6%. Levy became a director of the Scottish football club Rangers, in which ENIC held a significant stake until 2004. ENIC also held stakes in other European football clubs including AEK Athens, Slavia Prague, FC Basel and Vicenza (but all since sold), as well as non-football companies such as Warner Bros Restaurants and a Cambridge software company, Autonomy. He became chairman of Tottenham Hotspur in 2001. Tottenham Hotspur Levy made an attempt to buy Tottenham Hotspur from Alan Sugar in July 1998 but failed. Another attempt was made in July 2000 but that was again rejected, however, increasing hostility by fans towards Sugar eventually persuaded Sugar to sell. Levy was then appointed to the board of Tottenham Hotspur on 20 December 2000 after ENIC initiated the purchase of a 27% stake in the club from Sugar for ¬£22 million bringing their total stake to 29.9%, the maximum permissible before ENIC had to bid for the entire company. He replaced Sugar as chairman of Tottenham Hotspur in February 2001 on the completion of the sale, and took over the day-to-day running of the club in October 2001. ENIC would eventually substantially increase their shareholding and gain control of the company after buying the remaining shares off Sugar in 2007 for ¬£25m, as well as those of other shareholders, eventually acquiring 85.55% of Tottenham. ENIC moved the club into the private ownership in 2012. Levy became the highest paid Premier League chief executive, with an annual remuneration of over ¬£6 million in the 2016‚Äì17 season.  Managers  The first manager appointed with Levy at the helm was Glenn Hoddle in 2001. Hoddle however was sacked following a poor start to the 2003‚Äì04 season in September 2003. He was followed in quick succession by Jacques Santini and Martin Jol. Jol had some success moving Tottenham out of the mid-table, but was dismissed in 2007 after the team only won one game in the first 10 games. Juande Ramos succeeded as head coach in 2008. He delivered the League Cup, the first trophy under Levy's stewardship and the club's first in nine years, but Levy made the decision to replace him with Harry Redknapp on 25 October 2008 after Ramos made the worst start to a league campaign in the club's history in the 2008‚Äì09 season. Redknapp guided Spurs to a top four finish in the 2009‚Äì10 season, winning their entry into the qualification round of the UEFA Champions League for the first time. Tottenham reached the knock-out stages in the 2010‚Äì11 UEFA Champions League but eventually lost to Real Madrid. Tottenham finished fifth in the Premier League in the 2010‚Äì11 season, missing out on Champions' League qualification but securing a place in the Europa League. On 13 June 2012, Redknapp was relieved of his duties after failing to agree terms for a new deal. On 3 July Levy appointed former Chelsea and Porto boss Andre Villas-Boas as the team's new head coach.Tottenham Hotspur appoints Andre Villas Boas as new head coach from TottenhamHotspur.com. Retrieved 3 June 2014 Following some poor results in the first half of the 2013‚Äì14 season, including a 5‚Äì0 home defeat by Liverpool, Levy sacked Villas-Boas on 16 December 2013. Head of Football Development and former player Tim Sherwood was subsequently announced as head coach, but he also left at the end of the season. On 27 May 2014, Levy appointed Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino as head coach. The team reached the 2015 Football League Cup Final in Pochettino's first season in charge which also saw a number of the club's academy players step up to establish themselves in the first team, including Harry Kane, Danny Rose, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Andros Townsend. His team qualified for Europe with a fifth-place finish in 2014‚Äì15 before challenging for the Premier League title in the 2015‚Äì16 and 2016‚Äì17 seasons with a squad consisting of the youngest average age in the division. They also achieved their best ranking in 2016‚Äì17 since the 1962‚Äì63 season under Bill Nicholson. The team have been ranked amongst the top 4 since the 2015‚Äì16 season, allowing them to qualify and participate in the Champions League since 2016‚Äì17. They reached the final for the first time in 2018‚Äì19, but lost to Liverpool in the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. On 19 November 2019, Pochettino was sacked as manager of Spurs and was replaced the following day by Jos√© Mourinho. Finance and negotiations Levy is noted for maintaining a relatively modest wage structure at Tottenham compared to the other big 6 clubs of the Premier League; the club spent the least on wages among the top 6 clubs in the 2018‚Äì19 season, and it had the lowest wage/revenue percentage of all clubs in the Premier League. Levy has described the spending by other clubs in the Premier League as unsustainable. In the 2017‚Äì18 season, Tottenham made a profit of ¬£113 million (¬£138.9m pre-tax), a world record for a football club. The club was valued at around ¬£80 million when ENIC first attempted to buy a stake in 1998, and by 2019, valuations of the club have ranged between ¬£1.3‚Äì1.8 billion. Levy is the chief negotiator in the transfer of players for Tottenham. He has acquired a reputation for tough negotiation in the club's transfer dealings; former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson described negotiating with Levy over the transfer of Dimitar Berbatov as \\"more painful than my hip replacement\\". In 2013, Levy negotiated a then world record fee of ¬£86 million for the transfer of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. Levy is particularly known for his last-minute dealings on the last day of the transfer window, with notable examples including the signings of Rafael van der Vaart and Hugo Lloris. He is also known to target young players, in the hopes of developing them into major stars; this strategy has seen such successes as Gareth Bale, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Dele Alli. Levy has been criticised by Tottenham supporters and pundits alike for not investing more money in the transfer market; in the first four years of Pochettino's tenure as Spurs manager, the club had a net spend of ¬£29 million on transfer fees, considerably lower than the other major clubs in the same period. In 2018, Tottenham became the first Premier League club to make no signings during a summer transfer window. Levy has been instrumental in attracting corporate partners to the club in multi-million pound sponsorship deals including current partners Nike and AIA. He negotiated multiple shirt sponsorships in 2010 when he agreed a deal with software infrastructure company Autonomy as the club's shirt sponsor in the Premier League, with Investec becoming shirt sponsor for Champions League and domestic cup competitions. Levy has also promoted governance issues related to the Premier League, most recently advocating enhanced financial controls for all owners to ensure the long-term financial stability of clubs. In 2007, he lobbied successfully for clubs to be allowed to name seven players on the substitute bench, in order to encourage the inclusion of young players; the change was ratified in February 2008. Club training ground In 2012, the Club moved to its new training base set in 80 acres of greenbelt land. Planning and construction of the facility took over seven years and a player accommodation Lodge was added later. The Brazil National team stayed at the Lodge to prepare for the 2018 World Cup. New stadium Levy oversaw the construction of a new stadium next to the White Hart Lane site, from its design to the construction. The Northumberland Development Project was announced in 2008, with the building of a new club stadium at its centerpiece. After some delay, the construction of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium started in 2015. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 62,062, making it the largest club stadium in London and the second largest in the country. The project is intended to be a catalyst for the regeneration of Tottenham to bring new jobs and homes to the area. For the 2017‚Äì18 season, Levy negotiated the club's move to Wembley Stadium for one year to allow demolition of White Hart Lane and the completion of a new stadium on the same site as the White Hart Lane. During their time at Wembley, the club also broke the Premier League attendance record several times, as well as Champions League attendance record for a British club. The construction officially opened on 3 April 2019 branded as Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It includes the world's first dividing retractable pitch to accommodate other leading sports, notably American football, and entertainment events. The design allowed the club to agree a ten-year deal to host NFL matches at their new home from 2018. Awards In November 2017, Levy was named CEO of the Year at the Football Business Awards. Personal life Levy is Jewish. He is married to his former PA, Tracy Dixon, and they have four children.

While these vary considerably in details, there are certain points of similarity. The Brehon Laws governed everyday life and politics in Ireland until the Norman invasion of 1171 (the word \\"Brehon\\" is an Anglicisation of breitheamh (earlier brithem), the Irish word for a judge). The laws were written in the Old Irish period (ca. 600‚Äì900 AD) and probably reflect the traditional laws of pre-Christian Ireland. The codification of Welsh law has been traditionally ascribed to Hywel Dda, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. This was partly an adaptation of previously existing laws however. Welsh law remained in force in Wales until the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282 for criminal cases, and until the Acts of Union in the mid-sixteenth century for civil cases. Common features of these codes include an emphasis on the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim or the victim's kin rather than on punishment by the ruler. In other words, all law was tort law, with no \\"victimless\\" crimes or crimes against the State.  Celtic laws in late prehistory  While occasional references to \\"common Celtic law\\" in academic literature, such as Fergus Kelly's Guide to Early Irish Law,Kelly 1988, 231‚Äì2 seem to imply that there was one original Celtic law from which the various later Celtic laws, some of which are historically attested (see Brehon law, Cyfraith Hywel), evolved, it is unlikely that anything like 'original Celtic law' (or 'common Celtic law') ever existed as a unified, let alone a codified body of law. Rather, it is currently thought that various central and western European societies in later prehistory, commonly lumped together under the name 'Celts', had individually different customary laws, which evolved out of similar social needs, influenced each other considerably over several centuries or even millennia, and thus ended up reasonably similar to each other. 'Original (or Common) Celtic law' thus can only be reconstructed, and only as a generalisation.Karl 2005a. Such a generalisation does not reflect actual past legal practice, but can only show which general principles are likely to have been typical for many (but not necessarily all) early Celtic laws.  Basic workings  Celtic law evolved from the judgements of private competing judges. Murray Rothbard describes the system this way: > The basic political unit of ancient Ireland was the tuath. All ‚Äúfreemen‚Äù who > owned land, all professionals, and all craftsmen, were entitled to become > members of a tuath. Each tuath‚Äôs members formed an annual assembly which > decided all common policies, declared war or peace on other tuatha, and > elected or deposed their ‚Äúkings.‚Äù An important point is that, in contrast to > primitive tribes, no one was stuck or bound to a given tuath, either because > of kingship or of geographical location. Individual members were free to, > and often did, secede from a tuath and join a competing tuath.For a New > Liberty, Murray N. Rothbard, p.240 Celtic law is thus a stateless form of law like most customary law forms. \\"... the professional jurists were consulted by parties to disputes for advice as to what the law was in particular cases, and these same men often acted as arbitrators between suitors. They remained at all times private persons, not public officials; their functioning depended upon their knowledge of the law and the integrity of their judicial reputations.\\"Joseph R. Peden, ‚ÄúStateless Societies,‚Äù p. 4. After the private judge, chosen by the disputants, has made his decision, how was the judgement ‚Äì the compensation to the victim ‚Äì enforced? > Through an elaborate, voluntarily developed system of ‚Äúinsurance,‚Äù or > sureties. Men were linked together by a variety of surety relationships by > which they guaranteed one another for the righting of wrongs, and for the > enforcement of justice and the decisions of the brehons. In short, the > brehons themselves were not involved in the enforcement of decisions, which > rested again with private individuals linked through sureties.  Dating and definition  It is problematic to date ‚ÄòCommon Celtic law‚Äô, and the best we can arrive at are rough estimates. It is quite apparent, by parallels existing between Celtic and other Indo-European lawse.g. Dillon & Chadwick 1967, 11‚Äì2; D. A. Binchy 1972; Charles-Edwards 1980, 35‚Äì8; Kelly 1988, 231‚Äì2, FN 19. that at least some of the legal principles that make up Common Celtic law must be very ancient, perhaps going back to the Early Bronze Age or even the Neolithic period. Others may have only developed much later, perhaps even only as a result of contacts with Mediterranean cultures (mainly Greeks and Romans) during the late Iron Age and Antiquity. In some cases, cognate terms used for parallel practices in the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws allow us to assume that these practices were already used in what is referred to by linguists as the 'common Celtic period', which is usually dated to around 1000 BC (e.g. Kelly 1988, 231), although this at best is a very rough estimate. Where parallels for such practices exist, but with non- cognate terminology, in other Indo-European laws, we can start to consider the cognate practices as specifically Celtic forms of law. Similarly, where such cognate terminology exists for parallel practices in the early medieval Celtic laws, but not in other Indo-European laws, we can consider these to be specifically Celtic laws. As there are hardly any characteristics of Celtic law that cannot be found in at least some other, non-Celtic laws as well, the most sensible definition of Celtic law seems to be one that focuses on the language in which the law is (usually) dispensed. As such, 'Celtic law' would be any law (usually) dispensed in a Celtic language.  Sources  Quite generally, the oldest textual sources for Celtic laws which give us at least a very general idea of actual practice date from the late Iron Age, roughly the last two centuries BC and the first century AD. Some evidence can be gathered from the 'usual suspects', like Caesar's De Bello Gallico, who discusses some aspects of Celtic laws in his account of the Gaulish Wars, specifically his famous excursus on the Gauls,b.g. 1.11‚Äì20, even more specifically 6.13.4‚Äì10, 6.16.4, 6.19‚Äì20 but also in some other passages.e.g. b.g. 1.4, 7.2.2‚Äì3. Some of these passages allow us to confirm the existence, in some Iron Age Celtic laws, of some of the legal principles which can be reconstructed from early medieval Celtic laws as likely elements of common Celtic law,e.g. b.g. 6.13.6, 7.2.2 increasing the likelihood of any such generalised reconstruction. Other passages can tell us about particular legal practices in individual Gaulish societies, which are specific for just the society described, without allowing any greater generalisations.e.g. b.g. 1.4.1, 1.18.3. Besides some references in classical authors, there is a small number of texts in Iron Age Celtic languages, some of which (may) contain legal information, too. The most clearly legalistic sources are the Celtiberian inscriptions on Bronze tablets from Contrebia Belaisca (Botorrita), dating from early after the Roman occupation of this area.e.g. Meid 1993; Villar et al. 2001. Botorrita IV might even start with a legalistic formula, '[ tam : tirikantam : entorkue : toutam [] : sua kombal[ke]z : ...'Villar et al. 2001, 75, 83 which could perhaps be interpreted as '...the senate and the people have decided...',Stifter 2001, 100‚Äì4. mirroring the Roman equivalent. However, these texts are notoriously hard to interpret and not very long either. As such, they are of only limited value, at best allowing to speculate about local legal customs. To some degree, exceptionally short pieces of textual evidence in Celtiberian also allow to gain some information about what possibly could have been a widespread Celtic legal practice. From Spain, a number of so-called tesserae hospitales, 'hospitality tablets', are known, inscribed in Celtiberian, often with no more than a single word, occasionally with very short sentences. These may indicate a custom of granting hospitality to foreigners,S√°nchez-Moreno 2001 which may have had a basis in customary law and may have allowed to grant legal protection to foreigners, as also found in many other Indo-European societies and the early Irish and Welsh laws.e.g. Kelly 1988, 139‚Äì41; Karl 2006, 229‚Äì42. Finally, there are the archaeological sources, which abound, but are almost impossible to interpret as to their possible legal meanings. Of course, it may occasionally be possible to speculate that an archaeological feature, say, the remains of a fence, may have expressed some legal concept, e.g. ownership of property. But other than that, archaeology remains mostly silent. At best, archaeological evidence can help to strengthen an argument based on reconstructive generalisations from early medieval Irish and Welsh laws, ideally such that are also supported by evidence from historical texts.See e.g. Karl forthcoming.  Principles of Celtic laws in late Prehistory  A number of such legal principles, which most likely were widespread in early Celtic laws, can be reconstructed with reasonable degrees of probability. They are mostly centred around kinship and contractual relations, although we have some ideas about criminal law and legal procedure as well. For all of these, we also find reasonably similar principles in either Roman and/or Germanic laws, and in most cases also in other Indo- European laws, making it quite likely that these reconstructions are roughly accurate, even if they lack in detail. Given that many, if not most of them come with an internal Celtic cognate terminology, it is unlikely that they actually are late loans from e.g. Roman provincial law, although some crossovers in legal customs should be assumed. In at least some cases, e.g. in contract law, a co-evolution of Roman, Germanic and Celtic legal systems, based on intensive contact, is likely, even though the contract laws of each subgroup of these larger collectives may already have started out reasonably similar. = Kinship = Kinship without a doubt played a very important role in Celtic societies in late prehistory. The importance that ancestry had for the late prehistoric Celts is stressed by several classical authors,e.g. b.g. 6.15.2; Diodorus of Sicily 5.29.5 and seems ‚Äì at least for some areas, in some periods ‚Äì also be confirmed in the archaeology by the effort put into burials.e.g. Spindler 1976; Burmeister 2000; Baitinger & Pinsker 2002. The structure of Celtic kin-groups can be reconstructed to some extent,Karl 2006, 77‚Äì133 but little of internal kinship relations will have been formalised in a way that could be considered law. There are, however, a number of important legal principles that can be reconstructed, which are related to kinship or external kin-group relations. There is relatively strong evidence for a customary requirement for kin members to support and help each other, in everyday life as much as in legal disputes. This seems to be evident from historical sources,e.g. b.g. 1.4.2, 6.11.3‚Äì4 and would fit well with what we find in the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws.Charles-Edwards 1993. One of the most important legal principles that seems to have been associated with kinship is that of private property, especially the ownership of land and resources. In the very least, differential access to property and resources for different groups in society is evident in the archaeology, indicated both by differential burial wealthBurmeister 2000, 99 and relatively consistent enclosing of settlement space.e.g. Karl 1996; Cunliffe 2005. Most likely, access rights were at least partially based on kinship/descent, as this is the case not only in the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws, but also in the neighbouring Roman and Germanic laws. Even though we cannot be perfectly sure, inheritable individual possession of property and resources, with legal ownership resting with the wider kin-group, is the most likely form of regulating differential access to property and resources in Celtic societies in late prehistory. The other highly significant legal aspect associated with kinship relations is of sexual unions and reproduction. Inheritance seems to have been passed on primarily in the paternal line,Kelly 1988; Charles-Edwards 1993; Karl 2006. as such, clarifying the relations between partners, who probably quite frequently were members of different kin-groups, as well as their children, must have been quite essential. The surprisingly close parallels between the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws where sexual unions are concerned,Charles-Edwards 1980 and the similarity between the most prestigious union described in them with the Gaulish marriage as described by Caesar,b.g. 6.19.1‚Äì3 indicate that the treatment of different sexual unions was quite similar over wide areas of western Europe from late prehistory well into the medieval period. We also know that, at least amongst the Gaulish and the early medieval Irish nobility, polygyny was a widespread practice.b.g. 1.53.4, 6.19.3; Kelly 1988, 70‚Äì3. Given the detail given to different kinds of sexual union in early medieval Welsh law, it seems reasonable to assume that polygyny was also common in Wales some time before the law-texts were put into writing.Charles-Edwards 1980. Given that the main focus in the early medieval Irish laws where sexual unions are concerned are with the contribution to and division of assets of the union in case of divorce, as well as the responsibilities towards children resulting from these unions, it is quite likely that similar provisions also were at the core of earlier Celtic laws' treatments of the matter of sexual unions. This also seems to correspond with the significance attributed to the equal contribution of assets by Caesar,b.g. 6.19.1. while the fact that he assumes that the man would have owned more property than contributed by the wifeb.g. 6.19.1 would fit well with the possibility of several different kinds of recognised sexual unions, some with greater, some with lesser or no contributions by the female partner. While we have no direct evidence from late prehistory that divorce was possible, it is likely that the possibility existed ‚Äì again, this seems to be indicated by the emphasis on the joint accounting of input and profits made during the existence of the marriage,b.g. 6.19.2 which would have proven at least as useful in case of a divorce as it would for the reason given by Caesar, to determine the inheritance of the partner who survived the other. It is likely that there were other elements covering various issues of kinship relations in early Celtic laws, for instance covering adoption, expulsion of antisocial kin members, and inheritance rules in case that a whole lineage would be heirless, but there is too little available information on this subject from late prehistory to allow for more than a generalisation of similarities in these areas as found in early medieval Irish and Welsh law.for possibilities see Charles-Edwards 1993. = Artificial kinship = With kinship being an essential element in early Celtic legal systems, it seems likely that artificial kinship, in the form of fosterage, was also an important element of these early customary laws. Evidence for the exchange of children as hostages can frequently be found in historical sources,e.g. b.g. 5.4.2, 5.27.2; for more examples see Krau√üe 1998, 334‚Äì5 which, as most of them were the children of important nobles, must have been educated during this time, as they would have been expected to become important nobles themselves in the future. Similarly, the reference in Caesar that many Gauls send their children to study druidry, which is best to be studied in Britain at its alleged point of origin,b.g. 6.13.11‚Äì14.3 together with his remark that the Gauls do not suffer to be seen with their children in public,b.g. 6.18.3 might indicate that fosterage practices were widespread. This would seem to be supported by the fact that fosterage was important in both early medieval Irish and Welsh societies,Charles-Edwards 1993, 78‚Äì9; Parkes 2006. and that there is a cognate terminology in Irish and Welsh for the foster-father/teacher, allowing to reconstruct a Celt. *altros, 'nourisher, foster-father, teacher', as well as close friend/foster sibling, from Celt. *komaltros, 'jointly nourished, co- fostered, alumni'.Vendryes 1959, A-57; Delamarre 2003, 58‚Äì9. Fosterage networks, establishing artificial kinship and thus political and information exchange networks also are a good explanation for the spread of some aspects of 'Celtic' material culture, like e.g. La T√®ne art.Karl 2005b. = Rank = Another principle that seems to have been pretty widespread in early Celtic laws is that of the importance of social rank. It is not clear whether, in late prehistory, it was equally detailed as Irish law seems to indicate for early medieval Ireland.Kelly 1988, 7‚Äì12. However, it seems rather evident from statements like the one of Caesar that \\"... those most distinguished by birth and wealth have the greatest number of vassals and clients about them. They acknowledge only this as influence and power\\",b.g. 6.15.2 which is an almost perfect summary of the requirements set for different noble ranks in the early medieval Irish lawtext Cr√≠th Gablach,MacNeill 1923. that rank must have been an important element of Iron Age Gaulish customary law, too. While we do not know what precise advantages higher social rank may have carried, it is quite likely that there were some legal privileges for people of higher social rank. As Caesar reports that the leaders of the Gaulish factions are those with the greatest influence, whose opinion is most highly thought of,b.g. 6.11.3. it is quite likely that such differences in rank also had consequences in legal proceedings, much like in the Irish case.Kelly 1988, 7‚Äì10. = Contracts = The regulation of contractual relationships is one of the most important elements in any legal system, and especially so in societies where there is a lack of a strong central state, enforcing codified law. Where Celtic societies in late prehistory are concerned, all evidence points to such an absence of a strong central state control, and a largely kin-based enforcement of legal claims.Karl 2006, 124‚Äì30; Karl forthcoming. The regulation of contractual relationships therefore most likely formed the single most essential element of all early Celtic laws. As such, it is hardly surprising that some of the most obvious similarities, and the largest body of cognate terminology from late prehistory and between Irish and Welsh, in case of the latter two associated with parallel practices, exists.Binchy 1972; Stacey 1986a; 1986b; 1990; Pryce 1986; Walters 1986; Kelly 1988, 158‚Äì89; McLeod 1992; Karl 2006, 183‚Äì225; Karl forthcoming. Close terminological similarities or cognates can be found for witnesses, sureties, pledges, and distraint, which partially even extend into Germanic legal terminology,Karl 2006, 190‚Äì8; forthcoming. the latter supporting the archaeological argument that close trade links existed between late prehistoric Celtic and Germanic societies.Kristiansen 1998, 89‚Äì90, 147‚Äì9, 163‚Äì5, 238, 362, 366; Rieckhoff & Biel 2001, 41, 50, 89, 243. Generally speaking, all these elements are also common in other early Indo- European laws.e.g. Mitteis & Lieberich 1992; Johnston 1999. Historical texts also provide considerable evidence that later prehistoric contracts were secured with either pledges or sureties, the best example once again provided by Caesar, who reports that for the securing of a coordinated revolt against Caesar, the Gauls, \\"since they could not take the usual precaution of giving and receiving hostages, as that would have given away their plans, they asked that a solemn oath on their military standards be sworn, in which manner their most sacred obligations are made binding\\".b.g. 7.2.2. That children of nobles were frequently used as hostages (i.e. pledges) in state contracts, also between Celtic and Germanic polities, is also well documented in the historical evidence.Krau√üe 1998, 334‚Äì5. Celtic contract laws seem to have distinguished between two main kinds of contracts, such that were either immediately actionable or short-term and/or involved only very little risk, and such that were either long-term or established semi-permanent relationships, and/or involved high risks. While it would seem to have been sufficient to secure the first by just providing sureties, the second ones usually would have required both sureties and pledges. It is also quite likely that there was at least some degree of distinction between two different kinds of pledges, minor pledges on the one hand, and hostages on the other; and two kinds of sureties, one who would stand in as a surrogate for the original contracting party if that failed to fulfil its obligations, and one who would have the right to enforce the obligations of said party.Karl forthcoming. Particularly the latter would also have had an important role in the development of hierarchy in late prehistoric Celtic societies, with regularly approached enforcing sureties at some point being able to institutionalise their position as a social superior of those who frequently required their services, particularly if approached as an enforcing surety by all contracting parties. Contractual relationships most likely were of particularly great significance in ordinary subsistence economy. One of the close similarities that exists between early medieval Irish and Welsh laws is a cooperative farming, particularly co-ploughing, based on contracts agreed between small farmers with too few oxen to set up a full ploughing team.Jenkins 1982; Kelly 1988, 101‚Äì2; 1995, 445‚Äì77; Charles-Edwards 1993, 446‚Äì56. Given that archaeology seems to indicate that the average late prehistoric farm in much of temperate Europe had about 5‚Äì10 cattle, of which at the most 2‚Äì3 would have been oxen,e.g. Pe≈°ke 1984; 1993, 157‚Äì62; Pucher 1998, 57‚Äì8. and that Pliny reports that teams of up to 8 oxen were used on the heavier soils of the Gallia Cisalpina (with possibly even larger teams required for more northerly areas with even heavier soils),Nat. Hist. 18.171-2 it seems highly likely that similar regulations for cooperative farming practices were also common in many late Prehistoric Celtic laws. Reconstructable as Celt. *komarom, 'joint ploughing', it is one of the areas where early law may have even penetrated to within the internal processes of the individual kin-group, particularly where some members of a ploughing cooperative were not kinsmen, while others were: as formal contracts would have been required between all members of the cooperative, they would also have bound members of the same kin in formal contracts. Another important field where contracts most likely were of high significance is in the establishment of long-standing or even semi-permanent social relationships between clearly socially superior and inferior parties, particularly clientele contracts. The similarity between the Irish and Gaulish way to establish noble rank has already been remarked upon above. Comparable similarities seem also to have existed in the mutual responsibilities between noble patron and client.Wenskus 1961, 346‚Äì74; Dobesch 1980, 417‚Äì32; Kelly 1988, 26‚Äì35; Charles-Edwards 1993; Karl 2006, 270‚Äì304. The significance of contractual relations in late prehistoric Celtic laws is also given away by an episode in Caesar's account of the Gaulish Wars, in his description of how Dumnorix, an Aeduan noble, had acquired his vast wealth: \\"for a great many years he has been in the habit of contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the Aedui at a small cost, because when he bids, no one dares to bid against him\\".b.g. 1.18.3 Even the relationship between nobles and the state was based on contracts in late Gaulish polities, contracts no doubt constructed based on a more general model between lords and their clients: access to property or resources in return for rent. = Crime and punishment = Evidence for what constituted criminal offences, and what was considered the appropriate punishment for them, is mostly lacking for late prehistoric Celtic laws. What little there is to be found, again mostly in Caesar's account of the Gaulish wars, seems again to fit reasonably well with what we could reconstruct as ‚Äògeneral principles‚Äô from early medieval Irish and Welsh law. Crimes mentioned in Caesar's account are murder,e.g. b.g. 6.13.5 theft and robbery,b.g. 6.16.5 as well as crimes specific to only some Gaulish societies, e.g. usurpation of kingship amongst the Helvetii.b.g. 1.4.1. The punishment considered most severe amongst the Gauls, according to Caesar, is to ban criminals from religious rites,b.g. 6.13.6‚Äì8. which probably is better understood as outlawing them. He does, however, also mention the death penalty,b.g. 1.4.1, 6.16.4‚Äì5 presumably of outlaws, not as a regular form of punishment. The common form of punishment, however, seems to have been the imposition of fines. That Caesar mentions both praemia poenasque, \\"premiums and fines\\"b.g. 6.13.5 may indicate that a system with two separate kinds of fines, comparable to the body-fine/restitution and honour-price in early Irish and Welsh law,Kelly 1988, 125‚Äì7; Jenkins 1990; Charles-Edwards 1993 already existed in late prehistoric Celtic laws. As fines and outlawing are the preferred forms of punishment not only in the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws, but also in the early Germanic laws,Mitteis & Lieberich 1992, 60‚Äì3; Lupoi 2000, 293‚Äì5 it seems quite reasonable to assume that the same applied for most of the late prehistoric Celtic laws. = Procedure = Much as with crime and punishment, we have only little direct evidence from later prehistory where legal procedure is concerned. Caesar claims that the druids are the judges for all kinds of legal disputes, both where criminal and where civil law is concerned. Where the latter is concerned, the examples Caesar mentions are quarrels over inheritance and boundaries, indicating that such conflicts were seen as particularly important by his sources. That druids were moral philosophers is also known from other historical sources such as Strabo,Strabo 4.4.4 which may indicate that at least part of the druids was trained as professional lawyers. While we have no direct evidence for that, it is highly likely that legal proceedings only started if there was a plaintiff, either the injured party or a representative, the latter almost certainly a kinsmen of the injured party. Proceedings probably will have been started by a complaint to whoever was seen responsible to uphold justice, which might have been a druid, in some late Gaulish policies an official, or perhaps a noble patron of either the injured party or the offender, or possibly the offender himself had to be approached. It is most likely that if the offender did not submit willingly to settle the dispute in court, he could be distrained by the plaintiff. While we have no direct evidence for the latter, it seems quite likely, given that the practice is well attested in early medieval Irish and Welsh lawBinchy 1973; Kelly 1988, 177‚Äì86; Jenkins 1990 with cognate terminology,Kelly 1988, 177 FN 1 but also in the early Germanic laws,Mitteis & Lieberich 1992, 38‚Äì48 and even in early Roman law.Kelly 1988, 177; Cornell 1995, 272‚Äì92 What little evidence we have (almost exclusively a few lines in Caesar's De Bello Gallico)b.g. 1.4 would seem to indicate that a day would be appointed for the pleading, probably with pledges given or sureties named that the defendant would actually show, and both plaintiff and defendant would swear an oath that their respective claim or account of events was a truthful representation of what had occurred. Most likely, they could be supported by similar oaths sworn by their kinsmen, retainers, clients or whoever wanted to support them, as character-witnesses for the original plaintiff or defendant, quite comparable to the procedure in early medieval Irish, Welsh and Germanic laws.Kelly 1988, 190‚Äì213; Mitteis & Lieberich 1992, 44‚Äì8; Karl 2006, 124‚Äì5 Given that at least some contracts most likely were entered into in front of witnesses and secured by sureties, it is also likely that these may have been called up to give testimony, also supporting their accounts by similar oaths. We are lacking direct evidence as to what happened once a judgement had been found, and whether there were any appeals procedures possible, but most likely the party who had been convicted would have been expected to pay, by a certain date, any fines or premiums awarded to the victorious party. Any other form of punishment would probably be executed as well, if direct punishment possibly even right on the spot. If any fines or premiums awarded were not paid, it again is quite likely that the successful claimant then gained the right to distrain the convicted party and thereby recover a value equivalent to the unpaid fines or premiums. = Foreigners and the law = We have no direct evidence for how early Celtic laws treated foreigners for most of the late prehistoric Celtic world. However, the already mentioned tesserae hospitales from Celtiberia, as well as the common practice in early European legal systems to consider, in principle, foreigners without a local host as without legal protection,Wenskus 1961, 366; Benveniste 1969, 92‚Äì7; Dobesch 1980, 280‚Äì315; Kelly 1988, 5‚Äì6; Mitteis & Lieberich 1992, 23‚Äì6; Charles-Edwards 1993, 181‚Äì200, 402‚Äì3 we can assume that the same was the case in most if not all late prehistoric Celtic laws. While foreigners without local kin or a local host would thus have been 'fair game', it is likely that at least some members of late prehistoric Celtic polities were able to grant legal protection to foreigners (guests). This again would correspond well with the situation in early medieval Irish and Welsh law, where again cognate terminology exists for parallel practices of granting hospitality to foreigners.Vendryes 1974, S 146-7; Kelly 1988, 140 There is, of course, no evidence who actually could grant such hospitality, but it seems, if we go by the tesserae hospitales, that at least in Celtiberia this practice was not necessarily limited to ruling kin in larger polities, but was available at a relatively local level, which might indicate that, much like in early medieval Ireland and Wales, many members of any given polity were able to grant hospitality.  The evolution of the Celtic laws  Law is not static; it changes constantly to suit the needs of the society which it regulates. However, this does not necessarily mean that the principles on which these laws are based change at the same speed. Where the Celtic laws are concerned, it seems as if the guiding legal principles remained quite similar over an extended period, from late prehistory into the Middle Ages. Of course, this does not imply complete co-identity of legal systems between the communities of late prehistoric Gaul and those of early medieval Ireland. Rather, it is a result of similar social, political and economic requirements of the societies governed by these laws, which seem to have been sufficiently similar across this rather large area in both space and time that made fundamental changes to the legal principles unnecessary. The focus on certain elements of the law, like those dealing with kin-group relations and contracts, makes it likely that these principles evolved out of the needs of still primarily kinship- based societies. They seem to have remained reasonably useful even into times when primarily kinship-based forms of social organisation had been replaced with somewhat more territoriality-based ones, in which kinship nonetheless remained a very important structuring factor in society. While we cannot date or place the origin of the various principles that make up Celtic laws in later prehistory (some of them probably of great antiquity even when they became part of Celtic laws, others perhaps developed as late as the Iron Age), once we find them expressed in Celtic legal terminology, we can reasonably call them 'Celtic laws'. This development of a Celtic legal terminology seems to have taken place some time in later prehistory, with the conventional date given as roughly 1000 BC, even though this may be several centuries off. While based on generally similar principles, legal evolution took place locally or at the most regionally, to suit the requirements of any given society. Interaction between these different societies then must have resulted in useful innovations being adopted and adapted for their own respective needs by many societies, and less useful practices being abandoned as a result. It thus is quite likely that both the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws, the two that have survived for posterity in sufficient detail to be reasonable interpretable, are local developments, having originated where they are documented, but constantly subject to outside influence and internal innovation, and thus not particularly dissimilar to other laws practised in their vicinity at the time they were recorded.

Entirely based around wet lease, it conducted a mix of regional services for larger airlines and the military, as well as corporate, ad hoc and inclusive tour charters. Established as Busy Bee Air Service A/S by Bj√∏rn G. Braathen, the airline initially mostly operated corporate charters, using among other aircraft a Learjet 23 and later three Hawker Siddeley HS.125. After a near- bankruptcy in 1973, the company fell under the ownership of Braganza and was renamed Airexecutive Norway A/S. It focused on operating Short Skyvans and later Fokker F27 Friendships. From 1975 it operated regional services for its sister company Braathens SAFE and increasingly flew charter for the Norwegian Armed Forces. The airline took the name Busy Bee of Norway A/S in 1980, at which time it also took delivery of a Boeing 737-200C. Regional services were introduced with Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS), followed by Fokker 50s entering service from 1988. Reduced military charters and a loss of a vital contract in 1991 caused the foundation to fall out of the airline and it filed for bankruptcy in December 1992. Key people and assets reestablished the airline as Norwegian Air Shuttle. History Busy Bee was founded by Bj√∏rn G. Braathen, son of Braathens SAFE's founder and owner Ludvig G. Braathen. It rested on two niches--providing feeder services to Braathens SAFE's services and providing corporate charter flights. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi alone was in such high demand for corporate charter that the airline could nearly fill one plane with that group alone.Trumpy: 46 The company was incorporated as Busy Bee Air Service A/S in 1966, with operations commencing on 9 May. The name was inspired by a pub in London with the same name. Initially it operated a fleet of a Piper Aztec turboprop and a Learjet 23, the latter the first corporate jet operating out of Norway.Trumpy: 47 In December the Learjet was painted in zebra stripes and leased to a film company for the shooting of The Last Safari in Kenya. The Learjet was sold already in September 1967.Hagby: 242 Later that year the airline took delivery of the first of what would be three Piper PA-31 Navajos.Hagby: 243 A Cessna 185 was also bought, which remained in use until 1974. The airline followed up with a second Piper Aztec in 1968, but sold them both by 1969. A Cessna 206 was used between 1972 and 1974. Both the Cessnas were seaplanes, which operated out of the water airport at Fornebu. Busy Bee launched its first Hawker Siddeley HS.125 in April 1968, and added a second such aircraft in December 1968 and a third in February 1970. By 1968 Busy Bee was the largest private charter operator out of Norway. In addition to business executives, the airline derived a significant portion of its business from Norway's significant shipping industry. A typical task would involve flying spare parts and technicians to a far-away port to make crucial repairs to ships, allowing faster reentry into revenue service. The airline took into use an air-supported hangar at Oslo Airport, Fornebu in February 1969, which measured . This was caused by zoning restrictions at Fornebu, which banned the construction of permanent structures. The three HS.125s were sold in 1972.Hagby: 49 Fokker F-27 in Air Executive livery in 1978 The company came under financial distress in 1973. IT went into administration, was restructured and bought by Braathens SAFE's holding company, Braganza. The company took the name Air Executive Norway A/S. The aircraft were gradually repainted in white, red and blue to more closely match that of Braathens SAFE. Meanwhile, their ordered three Short Skyvans, which were operated until 1984.Hagby: 76 Fokker F27-100 Friendships which was taken over from Braathens SAFE, here depicted at Basel Airport in 1982 Braathens SAFE decided around 1975 that it would retire its Fokker F27s and focus entirely on operating services using jetliners. However, a few of their routes were not sufficiently heavily trafficked to warrant jetliners. An arrangement was reached whereby the three newest F-27s were transferred to Busy Bee, one each in 1975, 1976 and 1977.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 208 It also operated flights along the West Coast, connecting airports from Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik in the south to Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes in the north. From 1977 Busy Bee took over Braathens SAFE's two daily services from Stavanger Airport, Sola via Farsund Airport, Lista to Oslo.Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 272 Throughout the 1970s chartered contracts with the Norwegian Armed Forces became an increasing source of revenue for Busy Bee. To accommodate the increasing operations, Air Executive bought a Boeing 737-200 in 1979, named Storebia (\\"The Big Bee\\"). The following year the airline resumed it old brand, taking the name Busy Bee of Norway A/S. The aircraft received a new yellow and brown livery with a bee on the vertical stabilizer. The airline received its fourth F27-100 in 1981 and two more in 1983.Hagby: 102 Busy Bee won a contract to operate several inter- Scandinavian routes for Scandinavian Airlines System from 1982. This were mostly out of Copenhagen Airport to Stavanger, Kristiansand, G√∂teborg Landvetter Airport and J√∂nk√∂ping Airport, as well as between Oslo and Gothenburg. For instance, the Oslo‚ÄìGothenburg route replaced a Douglas DC-9 service which was running at a loss. With smaller capacity and higher frequency, Busy Bee was able to triple patronage within three years and brought profitability to the route. Due to disputes with the labor unions, SAS terminated parts of its contract with Busy Bee in March 1984. Instead they established what would become SAS Commuter. However, delays postponed the route transfer until December. The airline's Boeing 737-200C at Faro Airport in 1984 Busy Bee started services out of Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y to Bergen, Stavanger and Sandefjord Airport, Torp on 26 March 1984, as a subcarrier for Braathens SAFE.Melling: 223Tjomsland: 102‚Äì105 Braathens SAFE never made a profit on the service. Busy Bee made two major purchase contracts with Fokker in 1985. In May it ordered four new F27s with delivery the following year. In June it ordered four Fokker 50s with delivery in late 1988. The new F27s were of the modernized -200 variant. For four months of 1986 Busy Bee leased a fifth F27-200.Hagby: 380 The airline had a revenue of 209 million kroner in 1986, up 31 percent, and produced a profit of 5 million. Busy Bee partnered with Gambia Air Shuttle in 1987 to help start the airline's operations. For a year Busy Bee wet leased an F-27 to the fledgling airline to allow it to commence its route from Banjul International Airport to Dakar Yoff International Airport. By 1986 Busy Bee was earning 35 percent of its revenue from subcarrying with Braathens SAFE, 25 percent from SAS, 20 percent from military contracts, 10 percent from inclusive tour charter and ten percent from ad hoc charter. Busy Bee was the regular partner of Gulliver, who contracted the Boeing to fly three weekend trips during the summer to Greece. The company estimated that half its profits derived from the military contract. Busy Bee operated about 20,000 flights and transported 800,000 passengers in 1986. The airline's Boeing 737-200C at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in 1987 During the late 1980s the Norwegian Armed Forces changed their travel procurement practices, shifting focus on chartering aircraft to instead buying tickets on scheduled flights. This hit Busy Bee particularly hard, as it had a large portion of its revenue tied up with the military contracts. To compensate, Busy Bee increased its focus on European wet lease contracts, which it signed with among others NLM CityHopper, Austrian Airlines and British Midland International. The airline lost 12 million kroner in 1989. They were unable to sell three of the F27s which had been replaced with F50s the previous year. However, the company was able to downsize easily after 30 pilots resigned to work for SAS Commuter, which expanded its operations in Northern Norway in 1990. It proposed in October that the airline could take over operation of the military Lockheed C-130 Hercules transporters, allowing them to be wet leased on commercial duties when not in regular use, but the idea was squarely rejected by military. Fokker F27-200 Friendships landing at London Heathrow Airport in 1989 Services to Sandefjord were terminated in 1991. This followed an agreement that one Fokker 50 aircraft was to be sold to Wider√∏e Norsk Air. An important blow came in January 1991, when Busy Bee lost the tender to operate flights for the military, with Busy Be bidding just half a million above Norway Airlines's 100 million kroner. Thus the need for the 737 evaporated from April. This caused the company to reduce its staff from 325 to 200, and reduce its fleet from seventeen to nine aircraft. In September the military announced that it would abolish its leasing operations and instead buy scheduled tickets, terminating the last military charters from 1 April 1992. SAS and Busy Bee entered negotiations in November 1991 to look into the possibility of establishing a new airline, Norwegian Commuter. Several business models were considered, either with Norwegian Commuter pooling regional operations operated by the two existing companies, or an all- ot merger. Either way the idea was that the new company would have taken over all subcarried regional flights for Braathens SAFE and SAS in southern Norway. However, nothing came of the plans. The company received 30 million kroner in new share capital in December 1991 and a two-year contract to fly routes for Braathens. This was made conditional of both downsizing and wage reductions. The airline secured a contract to fly for the administration of Air Nordic out of Stockholm V√§ster√•s Airport to Sundsvall, Vasa, Gothenburg, √ñrebro and Oslo. On 4 May 1992 Busy Bee started flying a route from Stavanger to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport for KLM. Busy Bee filed for bankruptcy on 17 December 1992. The management started working during latter part of 1992 to create a contingency plan to continue operations past a bankruptcy. Regulations demanded that the chief pilot, chief technical officer and the accountable manager had to continue if the air operator's certificate (AOC) was to be continued.Trumpy: 50 They made an agreement with Braathens to fly the West Coast regional routes, cutting the hourly cost from 17,000 to 12,000 Norwegian krone.Trumpy: 52 Although operations had halted, the planning was initially carried out within the framework of the receivership. One million kroner was raised in capital.Trumpy: 54 Norwegian Air Shuttle was incorporated on 22 January 1993. Operations commenced on 28 January 1993 and the new airline kept the Busy Bee livery until May 1993, when a red, blue and white livery similar to that of Braathens was introduced. Fleet Busy Bee Boeing 737-200 at Aberdeen Airport Busy Bee employed three liveries throughout its history. During the initial Busy Bee period from 1966 to 1973, it had honey-colored detailing. During the Air Executive period until 1980, the airline had a mixed white, blue and red livery, which brought it close to that used by its larger sister company. The Busy Bee brand was reintroduced in 1980, after which the airline used a honey and brown cheatline and decorated the vertical stabilizer with a bee. From 1980 the airline operated a single Boeing 737-2R4C. The aircraft was bought through a partnership with the Norwegian Armed Forces, in which it was specially equipped to meet military needs. Specifically, it was a combi variant, which encompassed a side loading door and the possibility to quickly rearrange the interior between all-passenger, all-freight, combined passenger and freight, as well as VIP configuration. The aircraft was designed to be able to operate out from gravel runways and was also as the only 737 certified to be used for parachuting. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" +Busy Bee aircraft ! scope=col  Model ! scope=col  Qty ! scope=col  Built ! scope=col  First in ! scope=col  Last out ! scope=col class=unsortable  Ref(s) - ! scope=row  Piper PA-23 Aztec  2  1966  1966  1969  align=center  - ! scope=row  Learjet 23  1  1965  1966  1967  align=center  - ! scope=row  Cessna 185  1  1966  1967  1974  align=center  - ! scope=row  Hawker Siddeley HS.125  3  1967‚Äì68  1968  1972  align=center  - ! scope=row  Piper PA-31 Navajo  3  1967‚Äì69  1967  1974  align=center  Hagby: 221 - ! scope=row  Cessna 206  1  1966  1972  1974  align=center  - ! scope=row  Short Skyvan  3  1975  1974  1984  align=center  - ! scope=row  Fokker F27-100 Friendship  6  1964‚Äì67  1975  1992  align=center  Hagby: 292‚Äì294 - ! scope=row  Boeing 737-2R4C  1  1979  1979  1991  align=center  - ! scope=row  Fokker F27-200 Friendship  5  1986  1986  1992  align=center  - ! scope=row  Fokker 50  5  1988‚Äì89  1988  1992  align=center  Hagby: 112 - ! scope=row  Fokker F27-600QC Friendship  1  1968  1988  1989  align=center  } ReferencesBibliography  * * Category:Defunct airlines of Norway Category:Norwegian companies established in 1966 Category:1992 disestablishments in Norway Category:Airlines established in 1966 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1992 Category:Companies based in B√¶rum Category:Braathens ","title":"Busy Bee"},{"id":"1883808","text":"Bulle Ogier (born Marie-France Thielland; 9 August 1939) is a French actress and screenwriter.

Reruns continued to air until February 28, 1997.TV Guide - February 22‚Äì28, 1997 The cast members are human-sized anthropomorphic animals played by people in puppet suits using technology developed by Ken Forsse, the creator of Teddy Ruxpin. The same production technique was used for Welcome to Pooh Corner. Unlike Pooh Corner, the show never had NTSC VHS releases. Many of the show's cast went on to star in the Christian radio series, Adventures in Odyssey. The wagon used in the show was seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s on the vehicle boneyard lot of the Studio Backlot Tour at Disney-MGM Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. When the series first started, Sebastian is seen wearing only his hat, vest and short pants. After a few episodes, he is given a white T-shirt to go with it. Some of the puppets that were used for audience members in the circus were used for Mother Goose's Treasury. Background In the show, Dumbo has grown up, is able to speak, and has struck out on his own to begin his own circus. He and a cast of characters fly from town to town, in a wagon pulled through the air by Dumbo, performing their \\"greatest little show on earth\\". Other than Dumbo, none of the characters from the original film appeared in the show. Each character would perform a particular talent, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes. Characters=Main * Dumbo (voiced by Katie Leigh) - Also known as the \\"World's Only Flying Elephant\\". Star of the circus, Dumbo still relies on his magic feather to help him fly. He can usually be seen pulling the Circus wagon from place to place up in the sky. Often breaks the fourth wall towards the boys and girls watching the show, telling them when it's time for a song or for the sideshow. Being an elephant, Dumbo's memory is usually very good (based on the expression \\"An elephant never forgets\\"), his hearing is very sharp and sometimes his sneezes are often strong - strong enough to cause some wind. * Lionel (performed by Sharon Baird, voiced by Jim Cummings) - A high-pitched Brooklyn accented lion who serves as Dumbo's right-hand partner, popcorn vendor, ticket taker. and sideshow barker. He has a knot in his tail. Lionel was inspired by the character of Timothy Q. Mouse from the 1941 film and says goodbye to the viewers at the end of several episodes. Lionel's voice is almost similar to Timothy Q. Mouse as well. Unlike Timothy Q. Mouse, though, who wears a red drum major's uniform, Lionel wears a blue uniform (as do the performers in the circus band). * Fair Dinkum (performed by Patty Maloney, voiced by Hal Smith) - Also known as \\"Dink\\" for short, he is a koala who serves as ringmaster of the circus. As he is from Australia, he has the accent they have as well. There are a few things that Dink is afraid of - heights (so he's scared of flying) and drowning in the water being a few of them. His name comes from the Australian phrase, \\"fair dinkum\\". * Barnaby Bowser (voiced by Will Ryan) - A goofy dog who is the circus clown and magician as \\"Barnaby the Great\\". Known for saying \\"Ah-hee-ee-ee-ee-ee\\" whenever he laughs, and sounds like he's from the south. His magic tricks don't always work out the way he wants them to. Good friends with Lionel and Q.T. He also gets scared easily. Often hums his signature song \\"I'm Just a Lucky Dog\\". Comes from a big family - Edison Bowser (who invented flea powder), Isadoga Bowser (a famous dancer who perfected the \\"Dog trot\\"), Julia Bowser (Barnaby's favorite as she invented the hot dog) and his famous Uncle Lattimer Bowser, III. Barnaby shares a trait with Rabbit from Welcome to Pooh Corner (also voiced by Will Ryan) - both are gifted magicians. The only difference is that Rabbit's tricks usually work well, whereas Barnaby's doesn't always work the way he wants them to (though it sometimes gets plenty of laughs). * Lilli (voiced by Patricia Parris) - The only female character before Matilda appeared, Lilli is a beautiful cat who serves as a tightrope walker in the circus. Sometimes wears glasses because of her bad eyesight - mostly to see things that are very close like books, signs and to play checkers. Likes pretty things. * Q.T. (performed by Caleb Chung, voiced by Ron Gans) - A slow-witted, but good-natured orangutan who is the resident strongman and calliope player. In earlier episodes, he was accompanied by a small pink creature while playing the calliope. He makes friends easily, and has other talents, like kite making. Sometimes doesn't know his own strength. * Sebastian (voiced by Walker Edmiston) - A purple alley cat who is usually reduced to janitorial duties and likes to nap any chance he gets. Sometimes tricks others (usually Q.T.) to do his own work, but sometimes his tricks backfire on him. In the side show, Sebastian has a ventriloquism dummy with him called Sly. Others * Flip & Flap \\\\- A duo who are usually seen during the side show, telling each other jokes. They are identifiable by their appearances - Flip has long rabbit ears, and Flap has a red afro and a pig-like nose & cat-like ears, resembling a vampire bat. * Rinkum Dinkum (voiced by Hal Smith) - A later addition to the series, Rinkum is Fair Dinkum's older twin brother. In contrast to Fair Dinkum, Rinkum is much more brave and doesn't scare easily. Like his brother, Rinkum speaks in an Australian accent. He joins the circus as the resident stunt performer. During the Side Show, Rinkum puts on a show in which the audience has to guess what country he once visited and is pretending to be from. * Matilda Dinkum (voiced by Mona Marshall) - Another later addition to the series, Matilda is Rinkum and Fair Dinkum's younger sister and loves to dance. Also known as \\"Matty\\". Like her brothers, she speaks with an Australian accent. Her name comes from the famous Australian song \\"Waltzing Matilda\\". * Lattimer Bowser III (voiced by Laurie Main) - Barnaby's uncle who is a famous explorer. He looks like Barnaby, but is much older, with a moustache (which he occasionally brushes with his hands), and wears a monocle and a pith helmet. Speaks with an English accent. * Fira (voiced by Jim Cummings) - Lilli's aunt, who speaks with an upper class accent. Looks like Lilli, but whereas Lilli only wears glasses for reading, she wears glasses all the time. Finds Sebastian to be sneaky, even if he is a cat. * Mrs. Jumbo - Dumbo's mother, whom he sometimes talk about. Side-show acts *Sebastian and Sly *Flip and Flap **Flip and Flap at the Restaurant *Dumbo's Nursery Rhymes *Barnaby's Magic Show *Q.T.'s Knock-Knock Jokes *Lilli's Tongue Twisters *Rinkum Dinkum's Make-Believe *Lilli's Mystery Lionel introduces all of the side-show acts.

Description While Roan Cliffs are \\"remote and inaccessible\\", the Book Cliffs run along the edge of the Castle, Gunnison, and Grand valleys and are therefore readily visible from populated areas (i.e., Price and Green River in Utah and Grand Junction in Colorado) and well traveled transportation corridors (i.e., I‚Äë70, US‚Äë6, US‚Äë50, and US‚Äë191). As such the Book Cliffs are much better known than the Roan Cliffs. In addition, the name Book Cliffs is often applied to both landforms, with Roan Cliffs being an alternate name. Moreover, because of the how far they are spread between Utah and Colorado, they are sometimes mistakenly believed to be separate landforms of the same name within each state. The Roan Cliffs are situated north of (in back of) and above, but run roughly parallel to, the Book Cliffs. Stretching nearly from west to east, the Roan Cliffs begin on southern edge of the West Tavaputs Plateau, on the eastern edge of the Willow Creek (and the US‚Äë191 corridor), north of Emma Park, and northwest of Helper on the Carbon‚ÄëDuchesne county line. (The Book Cliffs do not reach into Duchesne County, but do extend a bit further west to the Price River.) The Roan Cliffs then run southeast along the southern edge of the West Tavaputs Plateau (but north of Whitmore Park), passing through the northeast corner of Emery County until it reaches the Green River in the Desolation and Gray canyons. (The Green River divides the West Tavaputs Plateau from the East Tavaputs Plateau and runs along the Emery‚ÄëGrand county line.) Upon entering Grand County, the Roan Cliffs initially pass through the southern edge of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. The cliffs continue their southeast course along the southern edge of the East Tavaputs Plateau until they reach a point near the head of Thompson Canyon (about north of the community of Thompson Springs). From that point the cliffs head northeast, but still along the southern edge of the East Tavaputs Plateau. They continue northeast until, after passing partially and briefly back into Uintah County, they reach the Utah‚ÄëColorado state line. East of the state line, the Roan Cliffs continue a northeastern course in Garfield County until they reach the East Salt Creek (and the SH‚Äë139 [Douglas Road] corridor). Beyond that creek, the Roan Cliffs run southeast along the southern edge of the East Tavaputs Plateau until they reach the Colorado River (and the I‚Äë70/US‚Äë6 corridor) at a point about north of the Town of De Beque. (The course of the Book Cliffs runs southeast to their eastern end at the Colorado River in the De Beque Canyon, near the town of Palisade and just northeast of the city of Grand Junction. This is also the eastern end of the Grand Valley.) The Roan Cliffs then run briefly northeast again (along the Colorado River) to a point about west‚Äënorthwest of the City of Rifle. This is also near the highpoint for the Roan Cliffs, the Gardner Benchmark, with an elevation of and coordinates . The course of cliffs then turns northwest to run along the southwest side of Government Creek (and the SH‚Äë13 [Government Road] corridor) until they reach their eastern end, just south of the Garfield‚ÄëRio Blanco county line, about south‚Äësoutheast of the \\"mid-corner\\" of Rio Blanco County and about northwest of the City of Rifle. History The Roan Cliffs were originally called the Brown Cliffs by John Wesley Powell (the second Director of the United States Geological Survey), but the name was officially changed in 1932 to Roan Cliffs, to better match the roan color of the cliffs.

It was published by Eclipse Comics starting from 1985. The story stars a Native American Apache named Emanuel Santana. The setting of the series is a dystopian United States that has become a Third World country. Publication history Twenty-four issues of the first series were published. After the series ended, a short comic featuring Santana's marriage ceremony was published inside Timothy Truman's first album release entitled Marauder by his band The Dixie Pistols. Two mini-series were published that 'bridged the gap' between the two Scout series: New America and Swords of Texas, each four issues long. While Truman oversaw them, others (including Ben Dunn) wrote and drew them. A one-shot 'Scout Handbook' was also published. A new series entitled Scout: War Shaman continued Santana's adventures after having two children and being widowed. The series ended with issue #16, after Scout is killed. Further series were planned, Scout: Marauder and Scout: Blue Leader, but never appeared. Scout: Marauder, described as \\"the first volume in a new graphic novel series,\\" was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2018. Plot A history of ecological excesses had led other nations to levy vast sanctions against the US for \\"stealing\\" world resources. Author Michael A. Sheyahshe noted in Native Americans in Comic Books ‚Äì A Critical Study, that \\"Scout is presented in a respectful and genuine manner with tribally specific cultural ties.\\" Collected editions Eclipse printed two trade paperback collections of the comic: Scout: Four Monsters (#1‚Äì7), and Scout: Mount Fire (#8‚Äì14). As well, Dynamite Entertainment published a series of reprints: *Volume 1 (collects Scout #1‚Äì7, 136 pages, November 2006, ) *Volume 2 (collects Scout #8‚Äì16, 140 pages, August 2008, ) Film adaptation In October 2016, Christopher MacBride is set to adapt and direct for the big screen for Studio 8.

He is a former member of the house band on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk shows. Early life Rosenberg became a trombonist when his junior high instrumental director, Leroy Evans, lent him a trombone to practice with over a summer break. Evans, concerned about a shrinking brass section due to graduating students, told Rosenberg to learn how to play and to come see him in the fall when school resumed. Rosenberg attributes \\"it all\\" to Evans. One memorable number performed by the Jazz Band under Mr. Evans was the immortal, \\"Take Back Your Heart, I ordered Liver!\\" Rosenberg attended George Washington High School on Bustleton Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia. His senior year in high school, he and the saxophonist in jazz band both made first chair in the Philadelphia All City Jazz band. Rosenberg's early influences included J. J. Johnson, Otis Redding, and Teddy Pendergrass. Early career After a short-lived first year at the Philadelphia Music Academy, Rosenberg abandoned his scholarship to tour with the band Vicki Allen and the Image. A high school friend and fellow musician Rick Gazda called him with \\"an offer [he couldn't] refuse\\" that brought him from Schenectady, New York to the Stone Pony rock club in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The offer came from Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. After joining the Jukes, Rosenberg moved to the Jersey Shore and lived in Belmar, Long Branch, and across from the Stone Pony. In 1981, a Jukes show at The Savoy, now the Hudson Theatre in New York City, caught the attention of Diana Ross's producer Nile Rodgers, who asked the horn section (known as The Miami Horns) to go on the road with her. After a two-year tour with Ross, Rosenberg returned, only to hit the road with Little Steven's world tour in support of his album Men Without Women. In the mid-1980s, Rosenberg fine-tuned his own bands, LaBamba and the Hubcaps and LaBamba's Big Band, made up of 13 horns. Association with Conan O'Brien While touring in Europe with Southside Johnny in 1993, Rosenberg got a phone call from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg, who had been tapped as the bandleader for Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Rosenberg joined fellow Miami Horns trumpeter Mark Pender on the show's band, The Max Weinberg 7. The band moved over with O'Brien to The Tonight Show in 2009 and became Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. When Conan left as a result of the 2010 Tonight Show conflict, the band followed him again, this time to TBS, for O'Brien's new television show Conan where they were known as Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band. In addition to playing the trombone, he also performed in skits such as \\"In the Year 2000.\\" He was also commonly the butt of Conan O'Brien's jokes during his monologues or interviews in which Rosenberg was often implied to be some variety of sexual deviant; Rosenberg responded with chagrin, or a few times, hid his face behind a sheet of music. He also occasionally acted in comedy bits, during or after which O'Brien nearly always ridiculed Rosenberg's meager line reading and acting skills. In January 2019, O'Brien premiered the new format for Conan which removed the band, ending their nearly quarter century television relationship. Notable performances In 1990, Rosenberg was joined by Ed Manion (baritone sax), Mario Cruz (tenor sax), and Al Chez (trumpet), billed as The Miami Horns, as part of Dave Edmunds All-Star Rock and Roll Revue. The Revue featured Edmunds with Graham Parker, Kim Wilson, and Dion leading the band which also included legendary guitarist Steve Cropper. Rosenberg and Jon Bon Jovi joined forces for charity events including the Special Olympics' \\"Very Special Christmas\\" television special in 1999, hosted by President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton at the White House. On May 3, 2007, Rosenberg performed the national anthem at the Golden State Warriors' playoff game (Game 6) vs. the Dallas Mavericks. With Conan being in San Francisco that week filming his show, LaBamba was invited to perform The Star-Spangled Banner at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, California. He and his big band teamed up with Southside Johnny for the album Grapefruit Moon: The Songs of Tom Waits, released in September 2008. The first two sessions were recorded in Bon Jovi's garage. In September 2008, Rosenberg brought his band, LaBamba's Big Band, on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to perform what Rosenberg later referred to as \\"the most outrageous experience ever, more so than the Super Bowl.\\" On February 1, 2009, Rosenberg performed with Springsteen and the E Street Band during the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIII despite suffering a recent foot injury. \\"There was so much adrenaline that I didn't feel any pain in my foot\\", he described afterwards. \\"LaBamba\\" From an interview by Patrick Jones: Personal life Rosenberg is married with five children.

Aileron and rudder trim tabs are not very common on light training aircraft. The center console of a small airplane. The vertical black wheel with spherical bumps is the trim-tab control. Moving it upwards changes the 'hands-off' elevator position to a more nose-down position; moving it downwards does the reverse. Trim tabs are small surfaces connected to the trailing edge of a larger control surface on a boat or aircraft, used to control the trim of the controls, i.e. to counteract hydro- or aerodynamic forces and stabilise the boat or aircraft in a particular desired attitude without the need for the operator to constantly apply a control force. This is done by adjusting the angle of the tab relative to the larger surface. Changing the setting of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting position of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position‚Äîto zero, if used correctly. Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is farther away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the moment generated by the tab can match the moment generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torques from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.  Uses in boats  Planing boats or boats that operate at speeds close to planing will often have trim tabs attached to the lower unit of the engine or the transom. These are used to adjust the pitch attitude of the boat while under way. The most efficient pitch attitude changes with speed, so trim tabs are adjusted based on speed and weight placement to maintain an efficient pitch attitude. Trim tabs are most found on cruisers, sport fishing boats and center console boats of various sizes. In some sailboats, the trailing edge of the keel has a trim tab which is used to null out rudder forces (lee or weather helm).  Uses in aircraft  All fixed-wing aircraft must have a system to allow the pilot to determine the airspeed, and maintain that airspeed with a minimum of control force and mental concentration. Elevator trim frees the pilot from exerting constant force on the pitch controls. Instead, the pilot adjusts a longitudinal trim control (often in the form of a wheel) to cancel out control forces for a given airspeed and weight distribution. Typically, when this trim control (wheel or lever) is rotated or moved forward, the nose pitches down; conversely, if the trim control is moved back, the tail becomes \\"heavy\\", and the nose pitches up. Many newer aircraft, especially jet aircraft, have electric trim controls. Many airplanes also have rudder and/or aileron trim systems. On some of these, the rudder trim tab is rigid but adjustable on the ground by bending: it is angled slightly to the left (when viewed from behind) to lessen the need for the pilot to push the rudder pedal constantly to overcome the left-turning tendencies of many prop-driven aircraft. Some aircraft have hinged rudder trim tabs that the pilot can adjust in flight. Most fixed-wing aircraft have a trim tab on the elevator. However, alternative means of controlling the speed and attitude of the aircraft are sometimes used, including: * a spring included in the control system that can be adjusted by the pilot * in the case of the elevator, an all-moving horizontal stabilizer, called a stabilator, the position of which can be adjusted in flight by a servo tab or an anti-servo tab. * On some aircraft (e.g. Concorde, McDonnell Douglas MD-11), fuel may be shifted to tanks in the tail during cruise to reposition the center of gravity in order to reduce trim drag. Maintaining the center of gravity near the aft-most limit for cruise improves cruise efficiency. When a servo tab is employed, it is moved into the slipstream opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to trim an elevator to hold the nose down, the elevator's trim tab will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure on top of the trim tab surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary trim tab is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed. The use of trim tabs significantly reduces pilots' workload during continuous maneuvers (e.g. sustained climb to altitude after takeoff or descent prior to landing), allowing them to focus their attention on other tasks such as traffic avoidance or communication with air traffic control. Both elevator trim and pitch trim affect the small trimming part of the elevator on jet airliners. The former is supposed to be set in a certain position for a longer time, while the pitch trim (controlled with the landing pilot's thumb on the yoke or joystick, and is thereby easy to maneuver) is used all the time after the flying pilot has disabled the autopilot, especially after each time the flaps are lowered or at every change in the airspeed, at the descent, approach and final. Elevator trim is most used for controlling the attitude at cruising by the autopilot. Beyond reducing pilot workload, proper trim also increases fuel efficiency by reducing drag. For example, propeller aircraft have a tendency to yaw when operating at high power, for instance when climbing; this increases parasitic drag because the craft is not flying straight into the apparent wind. In such circumstances, the use of an adjustable rudder trim tab can reduce yaw. On military aircraft during wartime, trim tabs often served as unintentional backup control systems for aircraft with damaged controls. Since trim tabs are usually controlled by their own dedicated system of control cables, rods, and/or hydraulic lines, aircraft that had suffered loss of primary controls could often be flown home \\"on the trim tabs\\", or by using trim adjustment as a replacement for the non- working primary controls. Such control is effective, if slower and more limited than primary controls, but it does allow the aircraft to be controlled and directed. In other cases, such as engine failure or damage causing asymmetric drag, trim tabs were invaluable for allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft straight without having to apply a constant force on the stick or rudder to keep the aircraft flying straight. Trim tabs were also important for aircraft such as bombers, which often underwent rapid changes in center-of- gravity when the bombload was dropped, requiring a hand ready on the trim- adjusting wheel to counteract the tendency of the aircraft to pitch up or down. Undertaking high-speed dives or deploying flaps also generally necessitated pitch trim adjustment, as aircraft of the era had different pitch tendencies at different airspeeds, and flaps could change the center of pressure. Even consumption of fuel could require periodic trim adjustment during a long flight, as it was difficult to ensure that all fuel tanks were equally near the center of gravity. An extreme example was the later P-51 Mustang, which was given a large fuel tank behind the cockpit to allow long- range missions; as fuel from this tank was consumed it was necessary for regular adjustment of the elevator trim.  Trim tab as a metaphor  Grave of Buckminster Fuller Designer Buckminster Fuller is often cited for his use of trim tabs as a metaphor for leadership and personal empowerment. In the February 1972 issue of Playboy, Fuller said: The official newsletter of the Buckminster Fuller Institute is called \\"Trimtab\\".Trimtab, the monthly digital news service of the Buckminster Fuller Institute Fuller‚Äôs metaphorical use of the trim-tab mechanism received considerable media attention in January 2019 when actor Jeff Bridges appreciated it in his Cecil B. DeMille Award acceptance speech at the 76th Golden Globes: 'Bucky made the analogy that a trim tab is an example of how the individual is connected to society and how we affect society. And I like to think of myself as a trim tab. All of us are trim tabs. We might seem like we‚Äôre not up to the task, but we are, man. We‚Äôre alive! We can make a difference!

The character was reprised in the 1990 film Return to Green Acres. CNN rated the character as being amongst \\"The most stylish TV housewives of all time\\". Character background Lisa (portrayed by actress Eva Gabor), a glamorous Hungarian immigrant, plays the role of the wife of Oliver Wendell Douglas, a successful New York City attorney who had long harbored the dream of moving to the Midwest and operating a farm. The leitmotif of the character through the years remains her comedic Hungarian accent, which leads to numerous jocular interactions with the Hooterville locals, who mishear Lisa's statements and are likewise misheard by Lisa. Both Lisa and Oliver are regularly portrayed as wearing city clothes, which seem misfit in the Hooterville expanse. Lisa's penchant for wearing resplendent jewelry, costly dresses and heeled footwear adds to this characterization through the seasons. Timeline In the initial episodes, Lisa plays a Manhattan socialite who has no desire to leave the luxuries of her lifestyle in New York, but is forced to do so and move to rural Hooterville, when her husband, whom she loves considerably, decides to undertake farming. After shifting to Hooterville, she becomes close to many farm animals, especially to the neighboring family's pet piglet Arnold, and takes up various cooking activities. Yet, despite her attempts, Lisa is unable to fit into the Hooterville culture, wishing relentlessly to go back, while her husband sticks resolutely to his philanthropic values of remaining embedded to the rural heartland. Eva Gabor's portrayal of Lisa Douglas, featured above in the 1965 show-premiere publicity image, garnered broad critical acclaim As the episodes progress, it is Lisa who becomes comfortably enmeshed with the Hooterville life, undertaking various entrepreneurial and philanthropic activities, while Oliver faces numerous challenges, both in his entrepreneurial work and philanthropic orientation. The final episodes impress the significance of Lisa's rise to prominence in the Hooterville community and the apparent lack of importance that Hooterville residents accord to her husband. The concluding episode of the series, titled Lisa the Psychologist, reemphasizes this portrayal, showcasing Lisa as a psychoanalyst whose services are much sought after by one and all. The character of Lisa Douglas is reprised in the 1990 film Return to Green Acres, which shows Lisa and Oliver, after a spate of disappointments, shifting to New York. However, subsequent to Hooterville residents reaching out to Lisa and Oliver for support to save their homes from being usurped by a local developer, both Lisa and Oliver realize their significant emotional attachment to Hooterville; and finally decide to move back. Critical review The character of Lisa Douglas engendered broad critical acclaim. While CNN rated the character as being amongst \\"The most stylish TV housewives of all time\\", Lisa's character has also been critiqued as exemplifying an American housewife of those times who goes as per her husband's views. At the same time, Lisa's character has been reviewed broadly as being amongst select \\"familiar and congenial\\" television characters, those which offered the American audiences an \\"escape and a sense that order might yet prevail.\\" Larry Karaszewski writes in the USC Spectator: \\"While Mr. Douglas thinks he is a 'real farmer', Mrs. Douglas has no such pretensions. She simply is what she is and the citizens of Hooterville accept her for being herself [...] Much of Green Acres is about a communications gap and Lisa is central to the gap.\\" In the book Politics and the American Television Comedy, pop culture author Doyle Greene writes: \\"Oliver and Lisa were [...] transformed into cultural and political caricatures, even dialectical oppositions: husband versus wife; rural life versus urbanity; Protestant work ethic versus flights of fancy; and, above all, America versus Europe. As the embodiment of Europe in all of its aristocratic glory, Lisa represents the very culture that America explicitly saw itself as being reborn from in the frontiers of the New World.\\" NotesReferences Category:Green Acres characters Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States Category:Fictional Hungarian people Category:Television characters introduced in 1965 ","title":"Lisa Douglas"},{"id":"1883888","text":"A hand-crafted, coal-fired, 1:8 scale 2-10-0 'live steam' locomotive in gauge, built in 14,000 hours over a period of 15 years. A \\"High Line\\" representation of a Whitelegg designed Baltic Tank in LT&S; Livery. This engine runs on a gauge of 3.5 inches known as Gauge III and is powerful enough to pull several people. High Lines are a configuration of a continuously elevated track and riders sit side-saddle or with legs straddling the track depending on lineside clearances. Live steam is steam under pressure, obtained by heating water in a boiler. The steam is used to operate stationary or moving equipment. A live steam machine or device is one powered by steam, but the term is usually reserved for those that are replicas, scale models, toys, or otherwise used for heritage, museum, entertainment, or recreational purposes, to distinguish them from similar devices powered by electricity or some other more convenient method but designed to look as if they are steam-powered. Revenue-earning steam-powered machines such as mainline and narrow gauge steam locomotives, steamships, and the worldwide electric power-generating industry steam turbines are not normally referred to as \\"live steam\\". Steamrollers and traction engines are popular, in 1:4 or 1:3 scale, as are model stationary steam engines, ranging from pocket-size to 1:2 scale. A Live Steam Festival displaying equipment ranging from small stationary engines to full-size locomotives. Porvoo, Finland, 2003  Railroads or railways  Ridable, large- scale live steam railroading on a backyard railroad is a popular aspect of the live steam hobby, but it is time-consuming to build a locomotive from scratch and it can be costly to purchase one already built. Garden railways, in smaller scales (that cannot pull a \\"live\\" person nor be ridden on), offer the benefits of real steam engines (and at lower cost and in less space), but do not provide the same experience as operating one's own locomotive in the larger scales and riding on (or behind) it, while doing so. One of the most famous live steam railroads was Walt Disney's Carolwood Pacific Railroad around his California home; it later inspired Walt Disney to surround his planned Disneyland amusement park with a working, narrow gauge railroad. A propane fired 1:8 scale live steam train running on the Finnish Railway Museum's miniature track. The live steam hobby is especially popular in the UK, US, and Australia. All over the world, there are hundreds of clubs and associations as well as many thousands of private backyard railroads. The world's largest live steam layout, with over of trackage is Train Mountain Railroad in Chiloquin, Oregon. Other notable layouts are operated by the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum and the Riverside Live Steamers. Scale A live steam locomotive is often an exact, hand-crafted scale model. Live steam railroad scales are generally referred to by the number of inches of scale per foot. For example, a 1:8 scale locomotive will often be referred to as a 1¬Ω\\" scale locomotive. Common modelling scales are Gauge 1 (1:32 scale), 1/2\\" (1:24 scale), 3/4\\" (1:16), 1\\" (1:12), 1¬Ω\\" (1:8), 2¬Ω\\" (~1:5) and 3\\" (1:4). Track gauge Track gauge refers to the distance between the rails. The ridable track gauges range from to , the most popular being \\", \\", 5\\", \\" and \\" (see Rail transport modelling scales). Gauges from and up are called \\"Miniature Railways\\" (in the US these are known as \\"Grand Scale Railroads\\"), and are used mostly in amusement park rides and commercial settings. Often the gauge has little to do with the scale of a locomotive since larger equipment can be built in a narrow gauge railway configuration. For instance, scales of 1.5, 1.6, 2.5, and 3 inches per foot (corresponding to scales of 1:8 to 1:4) have been used on a track gauge. The generally accepted smallest gauge for a live steam locomotive is O scale. Producing smaller-scale models remains problematic, as the laws of physics do not themselves scale: creating a small-scale boiler that produces useful quantities of steam requires careful engineering. Hornby Railways has produced commercial live steam-powered locomotives in OO scale by utilising an electrically heated boiler mounted in the tender, with cylinders in the locomotive, and control provided by electrical signals fed through the track from a remote control unit. They are less mechanically realistic than models in larger scales; the visible valve gear is a dummy, as on the electric-motor-powered models, and steam admission to the cylinders is controlled by a rotary-valve servo inside the boiler casing, which is also a dummy. Nevertheless, the locomotive is driven by steam that is created on board the locomotive and is hence a genuine steam locomotive. It is technically possible to build even smaller operating steam engines. Hand-made examples, as small as Z scale (1:220), with a gauge of only , have been produced. These are fired with a butane flame from a burner in the engine's tender. AA Sherwood of Australia, an engineering lecturer, produced some miniature scale model live steam engines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His smallest live steam engines were 1:240 scale which is smaller than the 1:220 of Z Scale. The smallest scale Sherwood worked in was 1:480, though that was not live steam. Technology 320px A wide variety of boiler designs are available, ranging from simple externally fired pot boilers to sophisticated multi-flue internally fired boilers and even superheater boilers usually found only on larger, more complex models. For basic locomotive models, a simple valve gear can be used, with the reversing (if any) performed by a valve, or by using a \\"slip\\" eccentric. More complex locomotive models can use valve gear similar to real steam machine with the reversing done mechanically, most frequently the Walschaerts type. Fuels There are several common fuels used to boil water in live steam models: * Hexamine fuel tablets ‚Äì which produce relatively little heat but are cheap and relatively safe. They are often used on \\"toy\\" live steam locomotives and engines, such as the newer models in the range produced by Mamod. * Methylated spirit, (methanol/ethanol mixture) ‚Äì which burns hotter than solid fuel, but, as with any flammable liquid, requires more careful handling. Cheap and easy to obtain, this fuel was used with early Mamod models. * Butane gas ‚Äì clean burning and safe, but relatively expensive to engineer the burners. * Electricity ‚Äì delivered via the track and used to boil the water with an immersion heater. In 2003, Hornby launched a range of 00 gauge models that run from a 10 to 17 Volt power supply, making this method safer than previous, higher voltage versions. * Coal ‚Äì which is the prototypical fuel for most full-sized steam locomotives, and the preferred fuel for ridable trains. It can also be used on boilers down to at least 16mm:1 foot scale. * Oil ‚Äì also a popular fuel for large, ridable trains. * Propane gas ‚Äì an alternative to coal or oil in large-scale models. Propane has also been used successfully as fuel in smaller 1:48 scale live steam locomotives produced most notably by Roland Neff.  Road vehicles  Live steam road vehicles are popular with model engineers because they are not restricted to running on tracks or water and can be easily transported for rallies and exhibitions. They include traction engines & rollers, wagons, cars, road-making & agricultural machines, often seen with ancillary equipment like threshing machines.  Boats and ships  Most types of boats and ships that were powered by steam in real life can be found as live steam ship models. These include, amongst others, speed boats, launches, tugboats, ocean liners, warships, paddle steamers and freight carriers. A specialized type is the tethered hydroplane. When steam-powered, these often have flash boilers.  Stationary engines  Stationary engines tend to be less popular with modelers than mobile engines; probably because they are less easily transportable. They are more popular with toy makers. They can be anything from small farm engines to winding engines and mill engines.  Toys  In the late 19th and early-mid 20th centuries, live steam toys were extremely popular, with some large manufacturers like Bing selling hundreds of different models in large quantities. There were very many smaller manufacturers all over the world. Some of these, like Mamod, Wilesco and Jensen, are still in business making live steam toys, although they are now mainly marketed as collectables and novelties rather than toys. Toys tend to be less accurate representations of real life equipment than are models and many are somewhat generic in nature. The range includes all those seen as models and some of a purely novelty kind.  Festivals  A live steam festival (often called a \\"Steam Fair\\" in the UK and a live steam \\"meet\\" in the US) is a gathering of people interested in steam technology. Locomotives, trains, traction engines, steam rollers and tractors, steam boats and cars, and stationary steam engines may be on display, both full-sized and in miniature. Rides may also be offered.  Publications  There are several magazines devoted to the live steam hobby: \\"Model Engineer\\" is an English publication that is published twice a month and was founded in 1898. Most locomotive articles have an \\"English\\" flavour popular in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The magazine is aimed at constructors but also covers non-steam and non-rail model engineering interests. \\"Live Steam & Outdoor Railroading\\" is a U.S. magazine, founded in 1966 and devoted to the live steam hobby, as well as to other uses of miniature and full-size steam. Originally, it was a mimeographed newsletter, but soon expanded into magazine format. In 2005, the name was changed from \\"Live Steam\\". It is currently published bi-monthly, with a press run of slightly over 10,000 (Dec. 2004). The now-defunct publication (launched in 2006), was \\"The Home Railway Journal\\". which was specifically aimed at enthusiasts with ride-on railways (although not just steam-powered) in North America. It is published quarterly in Sacramento, California, US.

As of 2016, the town has a population of 20 permanent residents, though it has a large proportion of houses owned as holiday properties. It attracts large numbers of tourists and is a major focus of the regional tourism industry. The town's name is taken from an early gold mine in the area, named for the German hall of fame, the Walhalla temple (Valhalla from Norse legend). Geography Walhalla is located in South-East Australia, in the eastern Victorian region of Gippsland, about 180 kilometres from the state capital Melbourne. It is located in the Great Dividing Range, in the steep Stringers Creek valley, approximately four kilometres upstream of the creek's junction with the Thomson River. The area around the town is designated as a historic area, adjoining the Baw Baw National Park.Ham, A., Holden, T., Morgan, K. Lonely Planet Melbourne & Victoria. Lonely Planet, 2014. The township is mainly located along one road which winds along the valley floor due to the steep terrain.Wheeler, D. Melbourne & Victoria City Guide. Lonely Planet, 2008, p. 283. After the 52 year gold rush period, Walhalla's population declined rapidly since the level of the gold has been extinct and for the latter part of the 20th century fewer than 20 people lived in the town as permanent residents. History=Discovery of gold The history of Walhalla is closely linked to the history of gold in Victoria. The first gold had been found in Victoria in 1851, leading to the Victorian gold rush. By 1859 prospectors had pushed far east of Melbourne into the trackless wilderness of the Great Dividing Range. Major gold strikes on the Jordan River encouraged other prospectors to follow the nearby Thomson River in their search for the valuable metal. A group of four prospectors who had been exploring in creeks flowing into the Thomson River valley found gold in late December 1862. A claim was pegged out and a member of this group, former convict Edward Stringer,The Story of Ned Stringer on the website of Toongabbie, Victoria retrieved Jan 2017 registered the claim at the stage post town of Bald Hills, now called Seaton, about 12 January 1863. Although his party were later posthumously presented with a monetary reward of ¬£100 for the discovery, Stringer was unable to capitalise on his finds, dying in September 1863. After news of the discovery became known, a rush to the creek began and a small town sprang up, The settlement was initially called Stringer's or Stringer's Creek, but after the township was surveyed it was later rechristened Walhalla - the name of the town's largest mine at that time. The creek running through town still bears his name. Access to the creek was an ongoing problem in the town's early days owing to the goldfield's remote and inaccessible location. In February 1863, two prospectors John Hinchcliffe and William Myers, discovered an immensely rich quartz outcrop in the hill just above the creek, which was named Cohen's Reef, after a storekeeper at Bald Hills. Mining operations Gold panning and related techniques quickly exhausted all the alluvial (surface) deposits. By late 1863 mining operations began as prospectors sought and then followed the underground veins of gold. At Walhalla this could mean tunnelling into the steep valley walls as well as the more traditional digging downward. The vast majority of gold extraction from Walhalla centred on Cohens Reef, the largest single reef in Victoria. By 1900 the reef had already produced around 55 tonnes of gold (approximately 1.8 million troy ounces, worth around US$790 million in 2005). Due to the enormous expenses of underground gold mining, small claims operated by individuals or small groups soon folded, being replaced by large companies such as the Long Tunnel Mining Company. This company owned the richest mine working the reef, the Long Tunnel, which produced over 30 tons of gold alone over its operation between the years 1865 and 1914, and paid ¬£1,283,000 in dividends to its shareholders. The crushing machinery used to extract the gold from the quartz-based ore required large amounts of energy, supplied largely by wood-burning steam engines. The need for fuel wood led to the hills being denuded for some considerable distance around town, timber tramways bringing freshly cut timber for the boilers. The associated costs of bringing wood from further and further away were a key factor in the economic problems which eventually ended mining in Walhalla. Boom period: 1863‚Äì1900 By late 1863 there had been more finds made nearby at Happy-Go-Lucky, three kilometres from Stringer's Creek, and at Cooper's Creek, where copper was later to be discovered in even greater abundance. By March 1864, Walhalla had a weekly mail service from Toongabbie, and the Walhalla Post Office was opened on 22 August 1864 (known as Stringer's Creek until 1868). Happy-Go-Lucky had a post office open from 1865 until 1916, as did Cooper's Creek from 1868 until 1893. The first hotel, the Reefer's Arms, was opened in September 1863. In time, there were more than a dozen hotels, breweries and an aerated waters factory. A branch of the Bank of Victoria was opened in September 1865, and a branch of the Bank of Australasia was opened in February 1866. Shopkeepers, publicans and other traders built the town up quickly in support of the rush. By May 1866, the township of Stringer's Creek had been surveyed and renamed Walhalla, after one of the most prosperous mines then working. Most of the first lots of township land were sold to the already-resident householders. That year saw a church building was erected for the Wesleyan Church, and establishment of a Police reserve and Court of Petty Sessions. A reconstruction of a former shop, which now houses a small museum highlighting the Walhalla Chronicle newspaper The growing number of families in the area saw the Mechanics' Institute and Free Library also serving as a school when it opened in 1867. Before long, Walhalla could boast fraternal societies, a debating club, and (briefly at least) a chess club, choral union and dramatic club. By January 1870, the Walhalla Chronicle newspaper was being published, and by December of the same year, a two-acre (.8 ha) site had been gazetted for State School No. 957, which had taken its first enrolments in 1868. A self-appointed \\"Council of Ten\\" sought registration as a Borough in 1869, but dissolved without the necessary public support for rating the town's properties before it could accomplish much more than commissioning the construction of the stone retaining wall that still stands today in the centre of town. A Borough was eventually proclaimed in late 1872, and by 1878 was able to successfully agitate with the state government for the completion of the first section of the present main road from Moe. By the end of 1879, Walhalla had daily coach services connecting it to the railway line at Moe to the south and to Traralgon to the east, and its isolation had been considerably reduced. A general store and modern caf√© The Long Tunnel Company introduced both electricity (1884) and the telephone (1891) into the mine. Although Walhalla briefly led the world in having two electric street lights in 1884, this service was never extended further into the town. But the community continued to grow, with houses and gardens lining the hillsides along the valley, to a peak population of more than 2,000 with more than that many again living in the surrounding mountain-top \\"suburbs\\" of Maiden Town, Mormon Town, Happy Go Lucky and Pig Point. Sporting activities included cricket and football clubs, with a cricket ground being created through levelling the top of a nearby hill as no other flat land was available. The Walhalla Football Association operated at the cricket ground between 1888 and 1913. Poverty Point The Italian community made a substantial contribution to the development of Walhalla, working a number of jobs including mine managers, wood cutters and splitters, farmers, miners and mine labourers, merchants and builders. The first Italian residents to settle down in the area came in 1873, when Pietro Bombardieri opened a tram station at the bottom of Little Joe Hill. They quickly proved themselves hardy and resourceful countrymen, particularly with their farming skills, and by 1882 were represented in the town's business community when Anthony Simonin opened the Alpine Hotel. Their two neighbourhoods, one extending along the Long Tunnel Extended tramway to the north, and the other in the southern end of town, peaked around 1910.. The wood cutters and splitters among them would set up camp in bark huts close to the area they were working, and it seems they rarely came into town. Around the turn of the century several of these families took up land at a remote station along the Thomson River to the north west, which was called Poverty Point. End of mining and decades of decline: 1915‚Äì1980 Walhalla township in 1910 After many years of lobbying from business interests, the Victorian government eventually agreed to the construction of a rail line into town. The line was completed into Walhalla in 1910, the last of four narrow gauge () railways built by the Victorian Railways. The seventeen small 2-6-2 NA-class tank engines which operated were interchanged between the four lines. The six remaining NA-class locomotives are owned by Puffing Billy Railway near Melbourne‚Äîfive of which are preserved and operating. Branching from the main Gippsland line at Moe, the Walhalla line crossed hilly farming country, until it reached the town of Erica where it entered heavily mountainous territory, crossing the Thomson River by means of a large steel and concrete bridge then snaking up Stringer's Creek Gorge over a track featuring ledges blasted from sheer rock faces, dry stone walls built rising from the creek bed, and six timber trestle bridges and brackets within the last few hundred metres into town. It was hoped that the railway would bring new life back into the community, however gold mining was already becoming largely unprofitable and the last of the major mines closed in 1914. With the disappearance of the main industry in town, the bulk of the population soon left. The Shire of Walhalla was incorporated into the neighboring Shire of Narracan in 1918. One of the railway's main uses became the removal of old buildings out of town, with the original railway station being relocated in 1938 to Hartwell in suburban Melbourne. In 1944, the section from Platina to Walhalla was closed, with the small copper and lime producing settlement of Coopers Creek using Platina as a supply point until the section of line between Platina & Erica closed in 1952. The service from Moe to Erica continued to service the farming and timber industries of the area, but it gradually decreased in patronage, until it too was closed in 1954. The line was dismantled late in 1958. A sawmill operated on the site of the former Long Tunnel Mine yard (now Stringer's Park) from 1949 until 1971. The Corner Stores opposite the mill was used as a barracks for mill workers and was in a poor state of disrepair when purchased by the Walhalla Heritage League in the early 1970s. Efforts to re-establish mining activities continued between 1915 and the early 1940s, though these were small scale operations producing only small amounts of gold. The town never became a ghost town and has been continuously inhabited with the population supporting basic facilities such as post office, hotel, church, general store and masonic lodge. On 10 March 1942 a Curtiss P-40 Warhawk of the United States Army Air Force flown by Captain Joseph P McLaughlin crashed near Walhalla on a flight from Canberra to Laverton. It was discovered in 1948.Crash of a P40E Kittyhawk into a mountain at Aberfeldy in Victoria on 10 March 1942 Oz at War Retrieved 30 November 2016P-40E Warhawk Serial Number 41-5526 Pacific Wrecks Retrieved 30 November 2016A Missoula pilot's long goodbye: More than 60 years after Australia crash, Missoula man's remains identified 3 November 2005 Missoulan Retrieved 30 November 2016 In 2006 his remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery.The lost US airman of Aberfeldy 23 March 2016 abc.net.au Retrieved 30 November 2016 In 1945, the Mechanics Institute, Bank of Australasia and St Patricks Catholic Church were destroyed by a fire started by a State Lands Department employee who was burning off invasive blackberries, and embers spread to the Mechanics Institute. The Star Hotel, Oddfellows Hall and Walhalla Shire Hall were also destroyed in December 1951 due to the use of the wrong fuel in the kitchen's ovens while making Christmas puddings in the Star Hotel, then owned by Arthur Malley. Malley was a descendant of Alice and Daniel Barber who owned Barbers Restaurant and Boarding House in west Walhalla from the early 1860s, and died in Collingwood, Victoria in 1957 (aged 66 years) before being able to return to rebuild. The school closed in 1965 and further floods and neglect slowly degraded the remains of the town. The last buildings lost to fire in Walhalla were Foley's Cottage behind the old fire station in 1993, (fire was caused by a candle), and Cumings Cottage‚Äîan original miner's home above the tramway on the western side, destroyed during a major bushfire in February 2019. Present The restored original fire station, built over Stringer's creek. Since around 1977, Walhalla has experienced something of a renaissance with a booming tourist industry and the restoration or reconstruction of numerous historical buildings in the town, including the Star Hotel, Mechanics Institute and reconstruction of the Thomson‚ÄìWalhalla section of the former narrow-gauge railway. Following amalgamation of local government in Victoria in 1994, the Walhalla and Erica/Rawson areas were placed under the control of the distant Baw Baw Shire at Warragul, 80 km to the west. Despite the much closer proximity and strong historical, social and economic linkages to the neighbouring Latrobe Valley cities of Moe, Morwell and Traralgon, the then Kennett Liberal/National Coalition Government elected to place Walhalla in Baw Baw. The Gold Era Shops were restored by the Walhalla Heritage League and now operate as a museum and coffee shop. In 1991, a group of interested parties formed a taskforce to investigate reconstruction of the Walhalla railway as a tourist attraction, something which had been unsuccessfully attempted on at least one other occasion previously. Work by the newly formed Walhalla Goldfields Railway commenced in 1993 at the former Thomson Station site, situated next to the Thomson River immediately before the bridge. With the restoration of the Thomson River Bridge, trains began to take tourists back up the Stringer's Creek Gorge, with a temporary terminus being created at Happy Creek due to the need for reconstruction of the timber trestle bridges completing the journey into town. This terminus was the end point for tourist trains from Thomson Bridge from 1996 until 2002, when the line was opened through to the old station site at Walhalla. The current station building is an exact replica of the original, although the yard layout is considerably different owing to a section of the former station's location having been covered by earlier road deviation works of the main road into Walhalla. In December 1998, Walhalla became the last mainland town in Australia to be connected to a reticulated electricity supply, \\"Historic Walhalla\\" Website although some other towns do not have mains electricity yet, such as Licola nearby, they do have a central generator unit that supplies the community. Walhalla was unusual in that every individual property wishing to have their own electricity supply had to provide their own generator. It was illegal to reticulate electricity (even to a next door neighbour) without permission from the (former) S.E.C.V. (State Electricity Commission of Victoria). The S.E.C.V. had half heartedly considered connecting Walhalla to the grid in the early 1970s, however this never proceeded due to the S.E.C.V. not really being interested, and the then town population being concerned that power poles and wires in the main street would ruin the heritage look and feel of Walhalla. The privatisation of electricity in the mid-1990s provided the opportunity for Walhalla to be reconsidered for connection with Eastern Energy (owned by TXU) undertaking a feasibility study. The new proposal was to run the cables entirely underground from nearby Rawson via 4WD tracks and then along the main street. A total of 6,940 metres of cable was laid from Rawson; this is under half the road distance and it cost $640,000 to connect Walhalla to the grid. The Star Hotel was the first to be connected on 16 December with the official switch on held on 21 December. Several significant attempts have been made resurrect commercial gold mining in the Walhalla area, with Walhalla Resources and Goldstar Resources investing significant amounts in the 1980s and 2002+ respectively. Both companies hoped to use modern mining techniques to access gold bearing ore that was not economically winnable in the town's gold era. In 2008, GoldStar was well advanced to obtaining a mining licence, but the company folded in early 2009 due to lack of funds, in part caused by the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. The company was then refloated as Orion Gold NL with a new management team and has adopted a less aggressive approach to restarting gold mining in and around Walhalla. In February 2016, Orion Gold sold its Walhalla tenements to A1 Consolidated Gold Limited (A1 Gold) for $850,000.http://www.oriongold.com.au/sites/oriongold.com.au/files/asx- announcements/20160202%20MIN5487%20Sale%20Update.pdf There is currently no mining exploration occurring in or around Walhalla. Walhalla has been impacted by major fire events in 2005, 2006/07, 2009 and 2013 although the town proper has not sustained any damage from bushfire (although a small rail bridge on the Walhalla Goldfields Railway was destroyed in the 2006/07 fire and quickly rebuilt.) A new CFA fire station was opened in Walhalla on 24 November 2013. This is the fifth location for the fire brigade over the town's 150-year history and is a satellite of the Erica and District Fire Brigade as the Walhalla Fire Brigade was deregistered in 1961. This is the second official fire station in Walhalla for 112 years. The first was the station that straddles the creek which was built in 1901 which is now a museum and houses the restored 1903 Merryweather Fire Cart. In October 2016, Michael Leaney, a long time Walhalla resident, business owner and community advocate, was elected to Baw Baw Shire Council to represent the newly created East Ward of the Shire. This ward is nearly 3,200 square kilometres in size with Walhalla being the most remote town in the shire accessible via a sealed road. 50 years had passed since Walhalla has had a representative on council. Phil Mouritz, the owner of the [then] Walhalla Lodge Hotel was a councillor for the Shire of Narracan in the mid 1960s. On Sunday 3 February 2019 Walhalla was directly threatened by bushfire. A fire that had been started by a lightning strike five days earlier to the east of the town was burning away from the town in a south easterly direction when an unexpected easterly wind caused the front to the fire to burn rapidly to the west. The town had been essentially evacuated during the day with only a handful of residents remaining and a CFA Strike Team. At 5:23pm the town's fire siren was sounded, and two hours later the flames were visible on the ridge to the east of the town near Maidentown. More firefighting resources were rushed to Walhalla as numerous spot fires started on the east and west sides of the valley. At 8:37pm rain started to fall and by 9:45pm over 15mm of rain had fallen essentially quelling the fire. One cottage was lost in Walhalla [on the western hillside north of the Long Tunnel Extended Mine], and five buildings were destroyed in Maidentown. The Walhalla- Stoney Creek Road Fire was active for over five weeks and burnt 8775 hectares. Mobile phone coverage came to Walhalla on 16 July 2019 with the official switch-on of a Telstra tower, the 600th tower to be commissioned under the Black Spot Program. The community had campaigned for almost ten years to get mobile phone coverage into the valley which posed a number of technically difficulties due to the steep topography. Landmarks and tourist information As well as historical buildings, the township features many mines and mineshafts, and the mountainous terrain is popular with hikers and bushwalkers. It is the starting point for the 650 km Australian Alps Walking Track, which continues to near Canberra. Walhalla also features two camping grounds; the North Gardens (free) and Chinese Gardens (paid). The current railway station is an exact replica built to the Victorian Railways plans of the original station building (now located in the Melbourne suburb of Hartwell), although the interior is different from the original configuration. It is on the opposite side of the station yard from its original location because the main road into Walhalla was realigned over the culvert across Stringers Creek in the 1960s. Train rides are operated by the Walhalla Goldfields Railway over the restored section between Walhalla and the Thomson. The Long Tunnel Extended Mine is open daily for tours underground to view the original gold workings, Cohens line of reef and the impressive machinery chamber carved out of the mountain. The Walhalla Corner Stores was purchased by the Walhalla Heritage & Development League (WHDL) in the early 1970s and were restored to their original design. The Corner Store now operates as a Post Office agency, shop and Tourist Information Centre with the adjoining shop housing a museum. Throughout the town, there is a Heritage Walk with over 30 interpretive signs that include photos and text explaining the various sites and buildings of the gold era. These signs were first piloted by the WHDL in 1996 and a grant from the Federation Fund saw a major expansion of the Heritage Walk. Over the years, additional signs have been added including on the 8 km walk to Poverty Point Bridge on the Australian Alps Walking Track. The Walhalla Visitor Map which is available for free in town shows the locations of these signs. The Walhalla Fire Station was built straddling Stringers Creek and is now open to the public as a museum. It was totally reconstructed in the early 1960s after many years of neglect and the structure seen today has been rebuilt from the floor up. The Band Rotunda was built at the junction of the left- and right-hand branches of Stringers Creek in 1896, commissioned by the Mountaineer Brass Band, who held a competition for its design. Two hotels were situated opposite the Band Rotunda, the Star Hotel on the north side of the creek fork, and the Grand Junction Hotel on the south side. The original Star Hotel was burnt down by a fire caused by a faulty hot water service in December 1951, but reconstructed in 1999 with a recreation of the original facade. The American actor Patrick Swayze visited Walhalla in his youth, where he enjoyed exploring the country side and the local history. Windsor House was built by German Johannes Gloz between 1878 and 1888 from around 90,000 handmade bricks, the only surviving brick residence in the town. Gloz maintained a vineyard on the slope above the building, producing around 900 bottles of Riesling in the year 1880. The building is currently a bed and breakfast. Situated on top of the hill, immediately to the north-east of the junction of the east and west branches of Stringers Creek is the Walhalla Cricket Ground, approximately a 45-minute return hike from the valley floor.  Long Tunnel Extended Mine  The Long Tunnel Mine about 1910 Long Tunnel Extended Mine (LTEM) was one of the richest mines of Walhalla. The main gold- bearing reef in Walhalla is called Cohens reef. The LTEM mine was started by Hercules United Gold Co. in 1863. After eight years, the company collapsed after not finding any gold. The mine was then taken over by the Long Tunnel Extended Company in 1871. They looked in the opposite direction and found a profitable part of the reef. This mine soon became the second most productive mine in the area (after the Long Tunnel) and in total produced 13,695 kg of gold before it closed in 1911. Overall, the Long Tunnel Extended Mine was Victoria‚Äôs fifth largest gold mine during the colonial era. Today it is operated by the Walhalla Board of Management on behalf of the people of Victoria as a tourist attraction. Underground tours are conducted daily. The mine‚Äôs 8.5 kilometres of underground workings extended to a depth of 923 metres below the machinery chamber, which in turn is some 150 metres below natural surface. The tour takes visitors 300 metres into the huge underground machinery chamber hewn from the solid rock over a century ago. Old mining methods are discussed and a large outcrop of the famous Cohens Line of Reef is exposed in the mine.

Like South American foxes, which are in the genus Lycalopex, it is not closely related to true foxes. Cerdocyon comes from the Greek words kerdo (meaning fox) and kyon (dog) referring to the dog- and fox-like characteristics of this animal. Origin Cerdocyonina is a tribe which appeared around 6.0 million years ago (Mya) in North America as Cerdocyon avius becoming extinct by around 1.4‚Äì1.3 Mya. living about . This genus has persisted in South America from an undetermined time, possibly around 3.1 Mya, and continues to the present in the same or a similar form to the crab-eating fox.Tedford, Richard H., Wang, Xiaoming, Taylor, Beryl E., Phylogenetic systematics of the North American fossil Caninae (Carnivora, Canidae). (Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, no. 325)PDF As one of the species of the tribe Canini, it is related to the genus Canis. The crab-eating fox's nearest living relative, as theorized at present, is the short-eared dog. This relationship, however, has yet to be supported by mitochondrial investigations. Two subgenera (Atelocynus and Speothos) were long ago included in Cerdocyon. Habitat The crab-eating fox is a canid that ranges in savannas; woodlands; subtropical forests; prickly, shrubby thickets; and tropical savannas such as the caatinga, plains, and campo, from Colombia and southern Venezuela in the north to Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina at the southernmost reaches of its range.J.F. Eisenberg, K.H. Redford Mammals of the Neotropics ‚Äì The Central Neotropics, vol. 3, University of Chicago Press, Chicago (1999) The crab-eating fox has also been sighted in Panama since the 1990s.Tejera-N, VH; Ara√∫z-G., V.

Scientia 14: 103-107 Its habitat also includes wooded riverbanks such as riparian forest. In the rainy season, their range moves uphill, whilst in drier times they move to lower ground. Their habitat covers all environments except rainforests, high mountains, and open grassy savannas. In some regions of their range, they are threatened with extirpation. Taxonomy and evolution Cerdocyon thous, C. avius and other species of the genus Cerdocyon underwent radiational evolution on the South American continent.De Lavigne, Guillaume. Free Ranging Dogs-Stray, Feral or Wild?. Lulu Press, Inc, 2015. All close relatives of the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) are extinct. It is the only living representative at present of the genus Cerdocyon. Genetically, there are 74 diploid chromosomes (36 pairs). Appearance The crab-eating fox is predominantly greyish-brown, with areas of red on the face and legs, and black-tipped ears and tail. It has short, strong legs and its tail is long and bushy. It may reach an adult weight of . The head and body length averages , and the average tail length is .

Conserv Biol 10:366‚Äì375 It is mainly nocturnal and also is active at dusk, spending its day in dens that were dug by other animals. It either hunts individually or lives in pairs; it eats crabs, lizards and different flying animals. It is easy to domesticate and farm, but its fur is not so highly valued as that of other species. The coat is short and thick. Coloration varies from grey to brown, to yellowish, to pale, to dark grey. There is a black streak along the back legs, with a black stripe along the spine. On muzzle, ears and paws there is more-reddish fur. The tail, legs and ear tips are black. The ears are wide and round. The torso is somewhat narrow; legs are short but strong. The dense hairy tail stays upright when they are excited. Life cycle and behaviour The crab-eating fox creates monogamic teams for hunting; groups of several monogamic pairs may form during the reproductive season. For population distribution, some explorers showed one individual distribution for 4 km2 while another observation showed that one distribution had changed from 0.6 to 0.9 km2 for one individual. Territorialism was noticed during the dry season; during rainy seasons, when there is more food, they pay less attention to territory.Nowak, Ronald M. (2005). Walker's Carnivores of the World. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. Hideouts and dens often are found in bushes and in thick grass, and there are typically multiple entrance holes per den. Despite being capable of tunnelling, they prefer to take over other animals' burrows. Hunting methods are adapted to type of prey. Several characteristic sounds are made by the crab-eating fox such as barking, whirring and howling, which occur often when pairs lose contact with one another. C. thous Reproduction The adult female gives birth to one or two litters per year, and the breeding pair is monogamous. The pair ranges the plains together. As a tropical animal, reproduction is not fixed to certain times of year, and takes place twice yearly. The reproductive period most often begins in November or December, and again in July. The birth of offspring follows after a 56-day gestation,Brady, Charles A. \\"Reproduction, growth and parental care in crab-eating foxes Cerdocyon thous at the National Zoological Park, Washington.\\" International zoo yearbook (1978). typically in January, February or sometimes March, then again from September to October. Diet The crab-eating fox searches for crabs on muddy floodplains during the wet season, giving this animal its common name. It is an opportunist and an omnivore, preferring insects or meat from rodents and birds when available. Other foods readily consumed include turtle eggs, tortoises, fruit, eggs, crustaceans, insects, lizards and carrion. Their diet is varied and has been found to differ by different researchers, suggesting opportunistic feeding and geographical variation. During the wet season, the diet contains more crabs and other crustaceans, while during the dry season it contains more insects. The crab-eating fox contributes to the control of rodents and harmful insects. Status of conservation The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) lists the fox as not threatened by extinction.Hutton, Jon, and Barnabas Dickson, eds. Endangered species, threatened convention: the past, present and future of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. London: Earthscan, 2000. The IUCN lists the crab-eating fox as being of \\"Least Concern\\". Subspecies The crab-eating fox has five recognized subspecies, differing in sizes and coloring of fur.

Measuring and accounting for the variability in this elasticity is a continuing problem in behavioral finance and consumer theory. Definition The wealth elasticity of consumption quantity for some good will determine the size of the expenditure shift due to unexpected changes in net personal wealth, ceteris paribus (i.e. the size of the so-called \\"wealth effect\\" for a given good). It is calculated as the ratio of the percent change in consumption to the percent change in wealth that caused it. This is analogous to the definition of the income effect from the income elasticity of demand, or the substitution effect from the price elasticity. The measure of \\"wealth\\" is mostly taken to be total personal realizable wealth at market prices, liquid or not: :Wealth = cash balances + government bonds + housing equity + stocks + other assets - debt Some economists say that bonds are simply a loan to the government and that they are not considered (on the aggregate) to be part of net wealth. Generally, the wealth change is measured in real terms. It may seem obvious that an unanticipated windfall will lead to greater consumption and that a fiscal loss will have the opposite effect. However, when the stock markets crashed in April 2000 (wiping out $2.1 trillion in nominal investor wealth) U.S. household consumption did not drop substantially. Some researchers have tried to resolve this difficulty by redefining wealth as the 'stable underlying value' of assets, which doesn't change with asset values, although this raises other questions of consumer rationality. Macroeconomic implications Most researchers calculate the wealth effect in real terms, so a deflation in price levels will increase personal wealth on average (because the total wealth in society is positive, the difference between saving and debt is tangible assets, such as land). The increase in private real wealth may give rise to a wealth effect of increased consumption. The macroeconomic effect of this on employment is called the Pigou effect, but whether or not this acts as a significant brake on a deflationary spiral is controversial. Pigou's reasoning for a positive wealth elasticity was that richer people feel more secure in the future and hence save less from current income. (So wealth is not redistributed by the effect.) The elasticity has important implications for monetary policy: Investments with a fixed yield (such as a bond paying coupons at 5%) will increase in net present value as interest rates fall. Since fixed-income bond-holders‚Äô personal wealth (at market rates) has increased, this may stimulate expenditure in a wealth effect. Working the other way, central banks often need to guess the wealth elasticity for asset price changes that have already happened in order to adjust the interest rate. In particular, the extent to which house price increases affect the rest of the economy is a critical question. Why income and wealth elasticities are separable A na√Øve assumption (or first approximation) linking the wealth and income elasticities of demand is: * Income elasticity = Wealth elasticity √ó rate of investment return. However, this approach overlooks the fact that people typically treat income and capital differently. (Behavioural economics hypothesises different \\"mental accounts\\" for income and assets, and points to empirical studies showing that the marginal propensity to consume extra income is one, but is lower for windfall asset increases.) Econometric research is ongoing to find good wealth elasticity parameters, especially in areas like house-price-related wealth effects. However, some patterns are widely believed to hold: * The wealth elasticity of the poor is much higher than the rich: ** If a pauper wins the lottery he'll tend to spend a large portion of the \\"Windfall\\" within a year. ** If a millionaire wins the lottery his consumption patterns change little. * The size of the wealth effect is based on perceptions of the permanence of the change in wealth. ** Intertemporal consumption: Nominal gains in stock market portfolios and other assets tend to have smaller effects on immediate consumption than predicted by the lifetime- income hypothesis (of rational consumption averaging based on NPV income expectations). ** Risk aversion probably causes the wealth elasticity of consumption to drop with asset volatility. (I.e. if people think their investments can be worth much less today than tomorrow, they tend not to consume the new capital because their utility curves tend to be convex - they have a preference for averages.) Other differences from the income effect If 'leisure time' is a superior good the income effect will partially cancel itself out, since people will work less as their hourly pay goes up. A change in net wealth doesn't require economic labour to produce, and has a different impact on the labour market.
