It is situated approximately 20 km west of Rheine and 20 km east of Enschede. History An early mention of the town was ‚ÄûOhtepe‚Äú (the eastern Epe or Ostepe) in the year 1143. A Christian church was established there in 1203. Between November 25 and November 30, 2005, the town was often off the German power grid, and was the topic of national news. The cause was a heavy snow storm with very wet snow. The power poles and cables between Gronau and Ochtrup were encrusted with a thick layer of ice. Due to the increased weight and the heavy storm most power poles toppled. Emergency generators from all regions of Germany were installed and operated in the following days and weeks. Dairy farmers were economically impacted as were other companies in the area. The collapse of the power poles, even today, is not completely understood. Some were 65 years old and rusted, but some were newer and constructed with special steel. Politicians in North Rhine-Westphalia blamed the power company, RWE for failure to replace older poles.

Originally, Ochtrup was a village which developed around Saint Lamberti Church. In the Middle Ages, however, Ochtrup was transformed into a fortification surrounded by a moat and a wall. The dimension of the fort can still be seen on the present town maps as its borders were formed by the streets Nordwall, Ostwall, S√ºdwall and Westwall which still surround the town center. The German word Wall means moat. Ochtrup as a fortification was meant to defend the trade road between Rheine and M√ºnster, and as such the town was attacked and conquered various times, e.g. in the Thirty Years' War. *The Jewish Cemetery of Ochtrup is in the Eastern part of the town.

It was premiered by the Beethoven Quartet and is the first in a series of four quartets to be dedicated to members of the Quartet. Vasily Shirinsky was the dedicatee of the Eleventh, the quartet's second violinist, who died on August 16th of the previous year. \\"http://quartets.de/compositions/ssq11.html\\"  Structure  The piece has seven movements, all of them in continuous playing, without pause: Even though Shostakovich was a prominent pianist, he is well known in the chamber music field for his string quartets, together with Arnold Schoenberg and B√©la Bart√≥k. In this quartet, Shostakovich portrays his fears with dark and grim moods. The quartet begins with a violin which introduces the main theme; this will be developed all along the quartet, with the rest of the group accompanying it somewhat subtly. It is immediately followed by the second movement which suggests a more sinister atmosphere with its mechanical and repetitive conception, always with a dialogue in two voices and adorned with glissandi; this movement is in a structure similar to that of a canon. The second movement leads to the dissonant beginning of the third, which jolts the whole quartet into a series of fast notes and long, dissonant chords. The fourth movement and the fifth form a diptych in which fast melodies and repetitive motions are present. In the fourth, the first violin plays fast notes while the rest of the group plays menacing chords; in the fifth, the ostinato in the second violin simplifies the motion presented in the previous movement. From now on, the general mood of the quartet changes and turns more elegiac and tragic. The sixth movement is much longer and consists of long chords and short melodic lines. Finally, the last movement is a recapitulation of all the themes presented in previous movement but, like the previous one, calm and profound. Playing time is approximately 16 minutes.

Education and diplomatic career  Heinbecker earned an honours B.A. from Waterloo Lutheran University (now Wilfrid Laurier University) in 1965. He has honorary doctorates from Laurier and St. Thomas Universities. Heinbecker joined the Department of External Affairs immediately after graduation; his postings abroad were in Ankara, Stockholm, Paris and Washington. From 1989 to 1992, Heinbecker served as Chief Foreign Policy Advisor and speechwriter for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and as Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet for Foreign and Defence Policy. In 1992, he was appointed ambassador to Germany. In the Department of Foreign Affairs in the late 1990s, he was the senior official responsible for the development of the Canadian human security agenda. He led the Canadian task forces on the Zaire and the Kosovo conflicts, participating in the diplomacy that ended the Kosovo war. He also served as chief negotiator of the Kyoto Protocol to the International Climate Change Convention. In 2000, Heinbecker was appointed Canadian representative to the United Nations. There he was a strong proponent of the International Criminal Court and argued for compromise to avoid the Iraq War of 2003.  Recent work  Heinbecker was a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and the inaugural director of the Centre for Global Relations at Wilfrid Laurier University. Heinbecker gained media attention in 2003 when he promoted a Canadian compromise at the United Nations which, if successful, would have obviated the Iraq war. A frequent commentor on Canadian foreign policy, he is the author or editor of numerous articles and books. Heinbecker‚Äôs most recent book is entitled, ‚ÄúGetting Back in the Game‚Äù. It has three components: Heinbecker‚Äôs history working as a Canadian Diplomat, an account of Canadian foreign policy, and the optimistic vision for Canadian foreign policy in the future. It promotes a future in which the government of Canada can take a stand and advocate for issues like climate change and the Middle East. He stresses in this novel the key role Canada plays in the rehabilitation of global governance. Heinbecker also edited a book alongside Patricia Goff entitled, \\"Irrelevant or Indispensable? The United Nations in the 21st Century\\". In 2005, he criticized fellow diplomat Franco Pillarella for the latter's claim that he was unaware that Maher Arar was being tortured in Syria or that torture was even practised there. On October 12, 2010, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said \\"Not being able to speak with one voice as a country had a negative impact on Canada's bid\\" for a seat in the United Nations Security Council, with reference to Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff's comments, which included \\"I know how important it is for Canada to get a seat on the Security Council, but Canadians have to ask a tough question: 'Has this government earned that place?'

The Assyrian were once a large ethnic minority in the Ottoman Empire, living in the Hakkari, Sirnak and Mardin provinces, but, following the Assyrian genocide, most were murdered or forced to emigrate to join fellow Assyrians in northern Iraq, northeast Syria, and northwest Iran. Most of those who survived the genocide and stayed in Turkey left the country for Western Europe in the 2nd half of the 20th century, due to conflicts between the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Turkish Land Forces. As of 2019, an estimated 18,000 of the country's 25,000 Assyrians live in Istanbul. Ottoman era The Ottoman Empire had an elaborate system of administering the non- Muslim \\"People of the Book.\\" That is, they made allowances for accepted monotheists with a scriptural tradition and distinguished them from people they defined as pagans. As People of the Book (or dhimmi), Jews, Christians and Mandaeans (in some cases Zoroastrians) received second-class treatment but were tolerated. In the Ottoman Empire, this religious status became systematized as the \\"millet\\" administrative pattern. Each religious minority answered to the government through its chief religious representative. The Christians that the Ottomans conquered gradually but definitively with the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 were already divided into many ethnic groups and denominations, usually organized into a hierarchy of bishops headed by a patriarch. As for the 5 Assyrian Tribes of Hakkari, The Shimun Patriarchate in Qodshanis, who the Tribes worshipped because it was the Assyrian Church of the Easts Holy See: was directly subservient to the Sublime Porte, who the See paid the taxes to which they collected from the tribes.Nisan 2002, p.188: \\"The wild Christian tribes of Hakkari, whither no Government of any sort has ever extended, still pay tribute to their Patriarch for transmission to the Sultan; and not taxes through the tax collector.\\" Those who had converted to Protestantism did not want to pay an annual tribute to the older churches through local bishops who then passed some of it up to the Patriarch who then passed some of it to the Porte in the form of taxes. They wanted to deal directly with the Porte, across ethnic lines (even if through a Muslim administrator), in order to have their own voice and not be subjected to the rule of the Patriarchal system. This general Protestant charter was granted in 1850.John Joseph, Muslim‚ÄìChristian Relations and Inter- Christian Rivalries in the Middle East: The Case of the Jacobites in an Age of Transition, State Univ of New York Press, 1983, ) Republic of Turkey S√ºryani in ethnic map of Turkey. Unlike other persecuted Christian groups like the Greeks and Armenians, The Assyrian community of Turkey managed to sustain its numbers after the Assyrian Genocide- but they had many hardships nevertheless. By the 1980s the Assyrian population of Turkey was at around 70,000 people, \\"The Assyrians of Turkey are a remnant population of the formerly large Assyrian Jacobite faction. They number about 70,000 souls.\\" http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/assyrians-in-iran#pt3 although down from the 300,000 or so in total who survived after the genocide. The currently diminished number of 28,000 Assyrians today was caused largely due to Kurdish insurgencies in the 1980s and the bad state of most of the Middle East, along with the forever looming issue of Turkish governmental discrimination. By the end of the conflict in the late 1990s, less than 1,000 Assyrians were still in Tur Abdin or Hakkari, with the rest living in Istanbul. In 2001, the Turkish government invited Assyrians/Syriacs to return to Turkey, but some speculate that the offer was more of a publicity stunt, as a land law passed a short time before caused Assyrians who owned untilled farms or land with forests on them (which a large amount did, as those in diaspora could not till or maintain the properties they owned while living elsewhere) to have the land they owned confiscated by the state and sold to third parties. Another law made it illegal for non Turkish nationals to purchase land in Mardin province, where most Assyrians would have immigrated to. Regardless of those laws a few did come, such as those who still had their citizenship and could buy property and managed to avoid having their land taken ‚Äì but many more who could have come back could not due to the laws passed. Some Assyrians who have fled from ISIL have found temporary homes in the city of Midyat. A refugee center is located near Midyat, but due to there being a small Assyrian community in Midyat, many of the Assyrian refugees at the camp went to Midyat hoping for better conditions than what the refugee camp had. To their supine, many refugees were in fact given help and accommodations by the local Assyrian community there, perhaps wishing that the refugees stay, as the community in Midyat is in need of more members. Religion The Assyrians are an ethnic group divided into a variety of different Christian churches, and those churches vary dramatically in liturgy and structure, and even dictate identity (see Terms for Syriac Christians). The predominant Christian denomination among Assyrians in Turkey is the Syriac Orthodox Church, with their 15,000‚Äì20,000 followers being called Syriacs. The second largest denomination is the Chaldean Catholic Church in Turkey, which has around 7,000‚Äì8,000 members who live primarily in Diyarbakir, Mardin, Sirnak province and Istanbul. In fact, Diyarbakir was the city in which the Chaldean Catholic church was first founded when it split from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1552. Prior to the Assyrian Genocide there was also a large community of Nestorians, or followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, and Syriac Catholics. The Nestorians lived in the Hakkari mountains on the southeastern edge of Turkeys border, which is now part of the modern day Sirnak and Hakkari provinces. Additionally, The Patriarch of the Nestorian church had his See based in a village in that region known as Qodshanis after him and his followers settled there in the 1660s, making Turkey the center of their church structure. As for the Syriac Catholics, the Syriac Catholic Church had their see in Mardin during the 1800s after being driven out of Aleppo due to oppression by the Syriac Orthodox Church, and a large community lived in the Southeast in the Tur Abdin region up until being massacred and forced to flee during the Assyrian Genocide to Lebanon, where the See was reestablished. There is still a tiny Syriac Catholic community that lives in Mardin, but other than that most Syriac Catholics now live in Iraq, Syria, or Lebanon. Assyrian Protestant Churches exist in Turkey as well.

Family  He was the younger son of Otto II and Agnes of Brunswick.  Biography  In 1254, he succeeded his father together with his brother Louis II in Bavaria and the Palatinate. The brothers divided their land in 1255 against the law. Henry received Lower Bavaria and Louis Upper Bavaria and the Palatinate. It was the first of many divisions of the duchy. Henry resided in Landshut and, in 1255, the work for the main castle of Burghausen Castle was begun. As the division of the duchy was against the law, it caused anger of the Bishops in Bavaria who allied with Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1257. In August 1257, Ottokar invaded Bavaria, but Henry and Louis managed to repulse the attack. It was one of the rare concerted and harmonious actions of both brothers who often argued. Henry was also later several times at war against the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Bishop of Passau. During the conflict of King Rudolph I of Germany with Ottokar II, Duke Henry repeatedly changed allegiance. During Duke Henry's reign, the Bavarian Peace Ordinances were put into place in his domains, stating, \\"Anyone out of doors at night without a lantern is violating the peace and is suspect of crime.\\" The ordinances extend further for the city of Landshut that anyone carrying a sword or dagger by day or night was liable to heavy penalties.Arnold 2004, pp. 123 Henry XIII was succeeded by his oldest son Otto III, who also became King of Hungary.

It was published in 1993 and 1994 by DC Comics as a part of the Vertigo imprint. The two bookends which open and close the crossover were written by Neil Gaiman and Alisa Kwitney, with the middle five issues being the newly created or resurrected Annuals from the then-on-going Vertigo titles (bar the Arcana Annual, which re-launched a new Books of Magic series). These were written by those titles' then-authors: Dick Foreman, Jamie Delano, Nancy Collins, Rachel Pollack and John Ney Rieber, respectively. This storyline marked the first attempt by the then-brand-new Vertigo comic line to do a crossover within its titles. Its relative lack of success, and the subsequent retooling of the Vertigo imprint to feature comics that do not tend to share a universe, make it unlikely to be repeated in such a manner. Subsequently, therefore, while individual characters (in particular John Constantine) occasionally guest-star in other titles, such a wide-ranging crossover has not been attempted. Titles In addition to the two Children's Crusade issues, the crossover ran through five newly created/resurrected Annuals. In reading order the event runs as follows: Children's Crusade #1, Black Orchid Annual #1, Animal Man Annual #1, Swamp Thing Annual #7, Doom Patrol Annual #2, Arcana Annual #1, and Children's Crusade #2. Collected edition In 2013, it was announced that Vertigo would, for the first time ever, publish the entire title in one collected edition. Following delays, the collection would eventually be released in 2015 as Free Country: A Tale of the Children's Crusade including the two issue mini-series, as well as a \\"brand-new middle chapter written by DEAD BOY DETECTIVES writer Toby Litt and drawn by artist Peter Gross\\" in place of the annuals of the original crossover. Characters Alongside Edwin Paine and Charles Rowland, the \\"Dead Boy Detectives\\", it focused on the children who played major roles in these books: Suzy, Maxine Baker, Tef√©, Dorothy Spinner and Timothy Hunter respectively. Advertising The crossover was advertised in the trade press, amongst them the fledgling Hero Illustrated. The advert featured a specially written five-panel strip in which Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine read the Vertigo Press release advertising the \\"big crossover in October and November [1993] in some of the Vertigo Annuals.\\"Hero Illustrated Vol. 1, Number 5, November 1993, p. 2 The crossover's tagline was \\"The Children's Crusade, it's no Fairy Tale,\\" and the author of the comic-strip-advert (likely Neil Gaiman, about whom it says \\"whoever he is\\") writes archly, through the character of Charles Rowland: :\\"It says here that the Vertigo Universe will never be the same again. :Of course, it was never the same before.\\" Plot summaries The story starts with the ghosts of two boys, Edwin and Charles (seen previously in issue #25 of The Sandman and later in The Dead Boy Detectives), who have set up shop as detectives for hire, with nothing but the knowledge of the great mystery novels and films. The two boys are approached by a young girl that finds their ad and enlists them to locate her brother who, along with several other children, disappeared from the small English hamlet they all live in, called Flaxdown. It turns out that all the children of the village as well as all other children who have ever disappeared (see \\"The Children's Crusade\\" & \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\") were taken to a place called \\"Free Country\\". Free Country is a place where children never grow old and are free from the abuse and tyranny of adults (child abuse is a recurring theme). Free Country is run by a council of various children who have existed there hundreds of years. The council is attempting to bring over all the children in the world, but unfortunately Free Country is having trouble supporting them all. To help bolster Free Country's power they bring over five innately powerful children. As long as the children stay in Free Country they provide the place with power. The comics include many references to the works of Robert Browning. Arcana: The Books of Magic Written by John Ney Rieber and with art by Peter Gross, the Arcana Annual reintroduced Timothy Hunter from Neil Gaiman's The Books of Magic mini-series. The story concentrated mostly on a young dancer called Marya, who leaves behind Free Country and an overly attentive admirer named Daniel to recruit Timothy Hunter to their cause. Tim is destined to be the greatest magician of his age, and his support would greatly strengthen Free Country - but before she can find him, the young magician is kidnapped \\"respectfully\\" by a falconer named Tamlin. Tamlin is apparently working on behalf of an unnamed Queen implied to be Titania, but when he takes Tim to a dying corner of Faerie he admits that he has his own agenda: Faerie is dying, and the falconer thinks that Tim may be able to save it. He gives Tim a gift of a magical stone, and leaves him to find his own way back to the real world. When he does, Tim meets with Marya and agrees to go to Free Country to see if he can help there. Marya doesn't return with him, deciding to stay in the real world and fulfil her dream of becoming a dancer. The Arcana Annual also acted as a prelude to a monthly The Books of Magic comic, which continued the stories of Tim and Tamlin, and Marya and Daniel. The Children's Crusade is due to be reprinted in July 2014 as a collected edition. The Arcana: The Books of Magic Annual #1 was included in the collected edition of The Books of Faerie. Prose adaptation In 2003, a prose adaptation of the crossover was released as part of a line of novels branded as The Books of Magic.

It was first described from the Taita Hills of Kenya from which it derives its name.  Description  Taita falcon photographed at Strydom Tunnel, South Africa This small falcon is fairly distinctive, but may offer some confusion with a few other species. The rufous belly causes resemblance with African hobby, but important features to look for are a white throat and the obvious rufous patches on the nape. Alsom the underwing coverts are uniform rufous, whereas the African hobby has more streaking. The most obvious underwing feature, though, is the flight feathers are barred black and white. whereas there is much more rufous color is in the flight feathers of the African hobby. The robust, long-winged Taita falcons have a short tail. Their flight is fast and somewhat heavy looking, but they are adept at aerial hunting. The wingspan of males is , and that of females is . Males weigh and females . Behaviour This species spends much of its time perched inconspicuously, emerging to pursue small birds with fast, parrot-like wingbeats. Occasionally, it soars high. Prey is captured on the wing and carried back to the perch to be eaten. It breeds April to September in East Africa and July to December in southern Africa. The nest is normally on bare rock, the clutch size is two to four eggs, incubation lasts 31‚Äì33 days, and the chicks fledge after about 42 days. Distribution and habitat The Taita falcon is patchily distributed from eastern and southern Africa. Breeding has been recorded from southern Ethiopia, southeastern South Sudan, eastern Uganda, Kenya (may occur at low densities throughout the country), Tanzania (scattered records), eastern Zambia (a few sites), Malawi (two recent records), Zimbabwe (20‚Äì50 pairs), Mozambique (one record of unknown reliability), Botswana, and northeastern South Africa (one site). It breeds in highlands and mountain regions with high cliffs and river gorges, mainly in areas with low rainfall. It is a rare and poorly known species. With fewer than 50 known nest sites throughout Africa and with previously documented eyries abandoned, Threats to the species come from the use of organochlorine pesticide sprays in northern Zimbabwe which may have reduced numbers there, and pesticide-spraying (e.g. through operations to control red-billed quelea and locusts) may pose a threat in other regions. Tourist flights using helicopters and microlight aircraft seem to have caused major disturbance to birds resident along the Victoria Falls gorges, where the remaining birds are threatened with flooding by a proposed dam. Reasons for its scarcity in East Africa possibly include competition for food and nest sites with the larger and more dominant peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and predation of young by the peregrine falcon, lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus), and owls. In Southern Africa itself, the birds can regularly be found in a few regular breeding sites. Formerly, a famous nest site was in the Victoria Falls gorge, and more recently, a well publicised pair was near the JG Strijdom Tunnel in the Limpopo Province of South Africa.

Called \\"the best known Colored Woman in the United States,\\" Talbert was among the most prominent African Americans of her time. In 2005, Talbert was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame, Mary Burnett Talbert Career Mary Morris Burnett Talbert was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1866. As the only African-American woman in her graduating class from Oberlin College in 1886, Burnett received a Bachelor of Arts degree, then called an S.P. degree. She entered the field of education, first as a teacher in 1886 at Bethel University in Little Rock. She then became assistant principal of the Union High School in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1887, the highest position held by an African-American woman in the state. In 1891, she married William H. Talbert, moved to Buffalo, New York, and joined Buffalo's historic Michigan Avenue Baptist Church. Talbert earned a higher education degree at a time when a college education was controversial for European-American women and extremely rare for African-American women. When women's organizations were segregated by race, Talbert was an early advocate of women of all colors working together to advance their cause, and reminded white feminists of their obligations towards their less privileged sisters of color. Described by her peers as \\"the best- known colored woman in the United States,\\" Talbert used her education and prodigious energies to improve the status of Black people at home and abroad. In addition to her anti-lynching and anti-racism work, Talbert supported women's suffrage. In 1915 she spoke at the \\"Votes for Women: A Symposium by Leading Thinkers of Colored Women\\" in Washington, D.C. During her national and international lecture tours, Talbert educated audiences about oppressive conditions in African-American communities and the need for legislation to address these conditions. She was instrumental in gaining a voice for African- American women in international women's organizations of her time. Mary Talbert, President of the National Association of Colored Women. Courtesy of The Champion Magazine, 1916 As a founder of the Niagara Movement, Talbert helped to launch organized civil rights activism in America. The Niagara Movement was radical enough in its brief life to both spawn and absorb controversy within the Black community, preparing the way for its successor, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Central to the efforts of both organizations, Mary Talbert helped set the stage for the civil rights gains of the 1950s and 1960s. Talbert's long leadership of women's clubs helped to develop black female organizations and leaders in communities around New York and the United States. Women's clubs provided a forum for African-American women's voices at a time when they had restricted opportunities in public and civic life. In both Black and white communities, women's clubs fostered female leadership. As a historic preservation pioneer, Talbert saved the Frederick Douglass home in Anacostia, D.C. after other efforts had failed. Buffalo's 150-year-old Michigan Avenue Baptist Church, to which the Talbert family belonged, has been named to the United States National Register of Historic Places. Many prominent African Americans worshipped or spoke there. The church also had a landmark role in abolitionist activities. In 1998, a marker honoring Talbert, who served as the church's treasurer, was installed in front of the Church by the New York State Governor's Commission Honoring the Achievements of Women. In October 2005, Talbert was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. She is also remembered around the United States as the namesake of clubs and buildings. Her honors include: * National Association of Colored Women (NACW) branches named after her in Buffalo, New York; Detroit, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; and New Haven, Connecticut; * City Federation of Women's Clubs named after her in Florida and Texas; * Talbert Hall at the University at Buffalo; * Talbert Mall Housing Development (later renamed Frederick Douglass Towers), Buffalo, New York; and * Mary B. Talbert Hospital (merged with Booth Memorial Hospital, later taken over by Cleveland Metropolitan Hospital), Cleveland, Ohio. Talbert died on October 15, 1923, and is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo). A small collection of Talbert family papers, concerned mostly with property and estate matters, survives in the Research Library of the Buffalo History Museum.  Progressive Era - Historical Background  Mary Burnett Talbert The period in United States history commonly referred to as the Progressive Era spanned from 1890‚Äì1920. It represented a progressive shift in what Axinn and Stern (2005) refer to as \\"the lines between the countryside and the city, between workers and the middle class, between foreigners and native-born, and between men and women\\" (Axinn & Stern, 2005, p. 127). Not mentioned in this shift is the gruesome treatment of African-Americans under the Southern \\"Jim Crow\\" laws which excluded Blacks from political, economic, public, and educational spheres of influence. These measures represented a tightening of oppressive politics and an era of social subservience, which arguably lasts into the present time. Discriminatory efforts took shape in black segregation in white social settings and strategically limiting Blacks right to vote with a combination of the grandfather clause, poll taxes and violent efforts at voting sites (Woloch & Johnson, 2009). Progressive era political reform was seen as necessary, but changing the attitudes and actions toward Blacks in the South was not on this political agenda. The hostile environment of the South combined with the loss of jobs and the threat of lynching, encouraged the migration of many Blacks to the north. It is estimated that from 1890 to 1910, roughly 200,000 African Americans left the South and this number continued to increase during World War I (Woloch & Johnson, 2009). The move north represented employment opportunities in the textile industry, in large factories, automobile production and the famed meat packing industry of New York, but were still not free from the harassment and discrimination that characterized this period of being Black in America. Axinn and Stern (2005) surmise that \\"the Black population was generally unaffected by reform activities and the social welfare benefits that resulted from them. In an era marked by economic progress and social mobility, the group remained poor and powerless\\" (Axinn & Stern, 2005, p. 132). Despite the bleak picture painted by Axinn and Stern, African-American leadership was not at a shortage and \\"powerless\\" certainly does not describe the Black pioneers of this era. Notable Black change agents including Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells and Mary McLeod Bethune helped lead the fight for Black equality and opportunity. Similarly influential but less well noted activists include Mary Church Terrell, Nannie Helen Burroughs and Mary Morris Burnett Talbert, who is a noted international activist, educator, leader and social reformer. In a 1916 speech Talbert states, \\"no Negro woman can afford to be an indifferent spectator of the social, moral, religious, economic, and uplift problems that are agitated around [her]\\" (Williams, 1994). Her life's work embodies these principles of dedication and hard work to improve the plight of Blacks and all people during this era.  A summary of Mary Talbert's accomplishments  *Established the Christian Culture Congress, a literary society and forum in 1901, which brought nationally prominent Black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Mary Church Terrell to Buffalo to speak at the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church. *Protested the exclusion of Blacks from the 1901 Pan-American Exposition Planning Commission, which resulted in the inclusion of a Negro Exhibit to feature cultural and economic achievements of African Americans. During the same year, Talbert lectured at the Biennial Conference of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC) in Buffalo as was instrumental in local arrangements *Joined the Phyllis Wheatley Club, the first club in Buffalo to affiliate with the NACWC, eventually served as the club's president *Co-organized the Niagara Movement, a precursor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the beginning of 20th century American civil rights activism *Co-founded Buffalo's first chapter of the NAACP in 1910, as well as NAACP chapters in Texas and Louisiana; elected Board member and vice president of the NAACP; served as National Director of the NAACP Anti-Lynching Campaign in 1921; eighth recipient and first woman to be awarded the highest honor by the NAACP, the Spingarn Medal. *Served as a YMCA secretary in Romagne, France during World War I; offered classes to African-American soldiers; sold thousands of dollars of Liberty Bonds as a traveling speaker served on the Women's Committee of National Defense. *Appointed to the Women's Committee on International Relations, which was responsible for selecting female nominees for positions in the League of Nations *Joined the Empire State Federation of Colored Women as a Charter Member, eventually serving as the Federation's Parliamentarian and President. *Elected President (1916‚Äì1921) of the NACWC; represented the NACWC as the first African-American delegate to the International Council of Women (ICW) at their 5th congress in Norway in 1920 *Restored the Frederick Douglass home in Anacostia, D.C.; elected president-for-life of the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association *Lectured in 11 European nations on the conditions of African-Americans in the United States, earning extensive press coverage. *Cofounded the International Council of Women of the Darker Races in Washington, D.C., in 1922 *First Worthy Matron of Naomi Chapter No.10 Prince Hall Order Eastern Star, subordinate chapter of Eureka Grand Chapter Prince Hall Order Eastern Star Inc. State of NY  Accounts of Mary Talbert's leadership  Hallie Quinn Brown, having the opportunity to befriend Mary Talbert, details a personal side of this phenomenal woman stating, \\"Mrs. Talbert possessed a kind, thoughtful, generous nature. She did not hesitate to do the smallest deed to the humblest person in any possible way. For if one does not possess these qualities in the small things in life she can never fully expand to the greater ones. Her personality was most charming, her smile an object of beauty. She possessed a ready and versatile tongue and pen. A letter from her was almost equal to a face to face conversation. She was at once graceful and gracious. By her ability, her oratory and her pleasing personality, she held the undivided attention of an audience‚Ä¶\\" Capturing the attention of an audience was not limited to Talbert's speaking engagements; some of her most formidable actions came in the form of letters detailing the strategy and philosophy behind movements such as the anti-lynching crusade. In a 1922 letter printed in the Crisis magazine, Talbert outlines the urgency of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs commitment to an anti- lynching campaign that did not divide among racial lines. In the opening lines she asserts: \\"The hour has come in America for every woman, white and black, to save the name of her beloved country from shame by demanding that the barbarous custom of lynching and burning at the stake be stopped now and forever\\" (Talbert, 1922). Lobbying the support of white woman's organizations, Talbert recognized the human element in lynching that extended beyond race to basic human rights. Her efforts were bold and likely dangerous as she elicited the contributions of Jewish women and Christian women in what she labeled \\"American womanhood‚Ä¶working for one particular objective‚Ä¶\\" (Talbert, 1922). She was well respected in the community of female leaders and Mary White Ovington, also influential in the Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People, expressed to the National Women's Party that \\"Mrs. Talbert is able, liberal in thought, and perhaps the best known colored woman in the United States today\\" (Ovington, 1920). Although Talbert was well received in some organizational circles, there were other venues that despite her recognition and champion for women's rights, she was still judged by the color of her skin. Mary Jane Brown (2000) highlights Talbert's official 1920 trip to Europe to attend the International Council of Women in Christiana, Norway as a delegate. In Paris, Talbert was with three other white female delegates and was not allowed into a dining room for breakfast because of her race. In every other country on this tour she was treated well, but not allowed to a tea sponsored by the YWCA in Paris (Brown, 2000, p. 39). This slice of history raises numerous questions regarding the status of gender and race not only in the United States but in the international community. Talbert was well aware of national and international perceptions of her prominence and the ideological environment that she sought to advance. In a short essay titled \\"Women and Colored Women,\\" Mary Talbert offers her opinion of the gender and race dynamic in terms of women's voting right by stating, \\"It should not be necessary to struggle forever against popular prejudice, and with us as colored women, this struggle becomes two-fold, first because we are women and second, because we are colored women. Although some resistance is experienced in portions of our country against the ballot for women, I firmly believe that enlightened men are now numerous enough everywhere to encourage this just privilege of the ballot for women, ignoring prejudice of all kinds‚Ä¶by her peculiar position the colored woman has gained clear powers of observation and judgment-exactly the sort of powers which are today peculiarly necessary to the building of an ideal country\\" (Talbert, 1915). Mary Talbert was certainly a powerful woman who reflected a lasting commitment toward improving the social welfare of women and African-Americans. In 1922 her numerous accomplishments were recognized as she became the first black woman to receive the coveted NAACP's Spingarn Medal, not only for her successful work in anti- lynching campaigns but her leadership in the Phyllis Wheatley Club of Colored Women, charter member status of the Empire Federation of Women's Clubs and her headship in preserving and restoring the Frederick Douglass Home in Anacostia as previously mentioned (Williams, 1993).

The tower was topped out in 2009 and it became operational on 29 September 2010 for the 2010 Asian Games. The tower briefly held the title of tallest tower in the world, replacing the CN Tower, before being surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree. It was the tallest structure in China prior to the topping out of the Shanghai Tower on 3 August 2013, and is now the second tallest tower and the fourth-tallest freestanding structure in the world.  Naming and etymology  There had been a long discussion about the naming of the Canton Tower since the commencement of its construction in 2005 after the groundbreaking ceremony. In September 2009, at the request of the tower's investor, Guangzhou Daily launched a contest for naming proposals. The contest attracted over valid entries, among which \\"Haixin Tower\\" () was awarded the first prize. The name alluded to the city's historical setting as the start of the Maritime Silk Road and the tower's geographical proximity to Haixinsha Island. However, this name was considered obscure to people unfamiliar with the history of the city. Local residents continued to refer to the tower by various nicknames including \\"Slim Waist\\" (), \\"Twisted Firewood\\" (; a metaphor for \\"stubborn\\" in Cantonese) and \\"Yangdianfeng\\" (; homophone of \\"epilepsy\\" in colloquial Chinese). The naming was reconsidered in 2010. After surveying a broad range of public opinions, \\"Canton Tower\\" was decided as the official English name and announced at the end of September 2010. The new English name, which alludes to the city's prosperous past, was considered the most identifying and least ambiguous among the multitude of proposals.  History  Canton Tower was constructed by Guangzhou New Television Tower Group. It is designed by the Dutch architects Mark Hemel and Barbara Kuit of Information Based Architecture, together with Arup, the international design, engineering and business consulting firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom. In 2004, Information Based Architecture and Arup won the international competition, in which many internationally large architectural offices participated. The same year the IBA ‚Äì Arup team in Amsterdam, developed the tower's concept design. In later stages, IBA cooperated mainly with the local Chinese office of Arup and a Local Design Institute. Subsequently, in 2005, the groundbreaking of the Canton Tower took place. The tower, although not fully completed, opened to the public on 1 October 2010 in time for the 16th Asian Games, hosted by Guangzhou in November 2010. The rooftop observatory finally received its official opening in December 2011.  Structure and construction  The Canton tower's twisted shape or hyperboloid structure corresponds to the Russian Empire patent No. 1896, dated 12 March 1899 received by Vladimir Shukhov, the Russian engineer and architect. The structure is similar to the Adziogol Lighthouse (designed by Vladimir Shukhov in 1910) in Ukraine's Dnepr delta.Hyperboloid Adziogol Lighthouse by Vladimir Shukhov in Ukraine  Structural concept  The tower under construction in November 2007.The tower was designed by Information Based Architecture and Arup. The Arup team led by structural engineer Prof. Dr. Joop Paul introduced near mass customization to the joint design, in combination with parametric design methods, and applied a simple structural concept of three elements: columns, rings and braces, to this more complex geometry. The waist of the tower contains a open-air skywalk where visitors can physically climb the tower. There are outdoor gardens set within the structure, and at the top, just above , a large open-air observation deck. The interior of the tower is subdivided into programmatic zones with various functions, including TV and radio transmission facilities, observatory decks, revolving restaurants, computer gaming, restaurants, exhibition spaces, conference rooms, shops, and 4D cinemas. A deck at the base of the tower hides the tower's functional workings. All infrastructural connections ‚Äì metro and bus stations ‚Äì are situated underground. This level also includes exhibition spaces, a food court, a commercial space, a parking area for cars and coaches. There are two types of elevators: slow-speed panoramic and high-speed double-decker. The zone from consists of a 4D cinema, a play-hall area, restaurants, coffee shops and outdoor gardens with teahouses. The highest and longest open-air staircase in the world, the Skywalk, starts at the height of and spirals almost higher, all the way through the waist. Parts of the skywalk's floors are laid with transparent glass. View of Pearl River From Canton Tower The top zone of the tower begins above the stairway, housing various technical functions as well as a two-story rotating restaurant, a tuned mass damper and the upper observation levels. From the upper observation levels it is possible to ascend even higher, via a further set of the stairs, to a terraced observation square rising above the tower's top ring. = The twist = The form, volume and structure of the towers is generated by two ellipses, one at foundation level and the other at a horizontal plane at . These two ellipses are rotated relative to another. The tightening caused by the rotation between the two ellipses forms a \\"waist\\" and a densification of material halfway up the tower. This means that the lattice structure, which at the bottom of the tower is porous and spacious, becomes denser at waist level. The waist itself becomes tight, like a twisted rope; transparency is reduced and views to the outside are limited. Further up the tower the lattice opens again, accentuated here by the tapering of the structural column-tubes.  Rooftop observatory  The indoor public observatory is 449 m above the ground, which takes the form of a terraced elliptical space, roughly half the size of a standard football field. Opened in December 2011, the rooftop at 488 m was the highest and largest outdoor observation deck in the world, taking over the title from the observation deck of Burj Khalifa at 452m. This remained the case until 14 October 2014, when the record of highest outdoor observatory was retaken by Burj Khalifa when it opened its new observatory called At The Top - Sky, at a height of 555m. Sixteen transparent \\"crystal\\" passenger cars, each with a diameter of and able to carry four to six people, travel on a track round the edge of the tower's roof, taking between 20 and 40 minutes to circumnavigate the rooftop. The installation is described by the media as a Ferris wheel; however, its passenger cars are not suspended from the rim of a wheel and remain horizontal without being fully rotated, and the track, which follows the incline of the roof, is closer to the horizontal than the vertical.  Architectural lighting design  At night, the tower glows and emits light, rather than being uplit. Lighting designer Rogier van der Heide is known for this concept, that he also applied at Marunouchi Building in Tokyo. Each node in the lighting design is individually controllable to allow for animations and color changes across the entire height of the tower. As all lighting is based on LED technology, and all fixtures are located on the structure itself, the lighting scheme consumes only 15% of the allowed maximum for fa√ßade lighting. At the time of the design of Canton Tower, lighting designer Rogier van der Heide was Global Leader of Arup Lighting.  Measurements  The Canton Tower's main body stands at . Combined with the tower's antenna, the Canton Tower has a total height of , making it the second tallest tower in the world, second tallest in Asia, and the tallest in the People's Republic of China. The tower has 37 floors, and 2 basement floors. The Canton Tower weighs a total of , including the tower's antenna which weighs and the main body, which includes all the features of the tower, which weighs a total of . The Canton Tower occupies a total floor area of . In addition, the tower's net usable area measures . Guangzhou tower's original design height was a total of 612.2 meters (including a 1.2 meter lightning rod). According to the Guangzhou Urban Planning Bureau and the Guangzhou Construction Engineering Supervision Co., Ltd., the Guangzhou tower adjusted total building height is 595.71 meters, with the main tower at a height of 448.80 meters, and the antenna mast height at 146.91 meters. The viewing platform is located in the tower mast antenna at a height of 488 meters.  Events  The Canton Tower during the 2010 Asian Games opening ceremony in November 2010. *As Guangzhou was selected to host the 2010 Asian Games, a small island in front of the tower was chosen to host the opening and closing ceremonies, as such, tower was chosen as the main protagonist of the ceremonies. Two weeks before the opening ceremonies of the games, the tower itself was opened to the public. *The Canton Tower hosted an annual Christmas Concert on Christmas Eve inside the tower's ground floor, making it the first concert to be held in the Canton Tower. Celebrated on Christmas Eve, the concert was held on 24 December 2012.  Geography  The Canton Tower is situated alongside the Yiyuan Road (Yuejiang Road West), in the Haizhu District of Guangzhou, and is situated south of the Zhujiang New Town. Additionally, several famous landmarks surround the tower, including pagodas, a park towards the south, and several high-rise apartments, buildings, and skyscrapers, both commercial and residential.

He appears more alien than human, with red, pupil-less eyes, gray skin, absence of a nose, sharp oversized teeth and large talons. Publication history In 1993, Dale Keown began publishing his character Pitt at Image Comics. Pitt #1 was the second best-selling comic book of November 1992, surpassed only by the collector's edition of Superman (vol.2) #75. In 1995, publication of Pitt was moved over to Full Bleed Studios (Dale Keown's own company). Fictional character biography In 1981, Allen and Annie Bracken, while on their way from the hospital, were taken by a Creed spaceship where their emperor Zoyvod took a fertilized egg from Annie and then returned them to Earth. While the Brackens were on Earth with what would become Pitt's brother Timmy, Zoyvod combined his genetic structure with the fertilized egg that would become Pitt. In the Creed Imperial stronghold the egg grew in a gestation tank, until the creature unexpectedly awoke and escaped. He was ultimately caught and Wroth, another Creed hybrid (and half-brother to Pitt), assaulted him. Believing him dead, a Creed alien named Quagg was supposed to get rid of the body, but was attacked by Pitt while flying to the corpse dumping grounds. In the fight, Pitt was blasted out through the door of the shuttle. On the ground Pitt clawed his way out of the dumping ground and lived in the wilds until Zoyvod sent a team out to retrieve him. Quagg and his team did manage to retrieve him, but only Quagg survived the mission. Pitt was then trained by Quagg and given his name. For years he worked as Zoyvod's assassin until an attack on the planet Chakra where someone named the Seer melded the consciousness of the child Jereb - an alien with 'immense spiritual power\\" - with Pitt. The merger apparently changed Pitt, turning him into a fugitive. Eventually he ended up on Earth. When Pitt arrived on Earth, he materialized in a New York City subway near Timmy and saved him and his grandfather from muggers. Immediately after, he disappeared into the city, drifting around while trying to adapt to the new world. On Earth he was followed by the Creed. Timmy, having a genetic structure similar to Pitt, was attacked instead of Pitt, bringing Timmy and Pitt together again. This was also the first time Rai-Kee met Pitt, who had been masquerading as \\"Bobbie Harras\\" a New York City Police Officer. During the fight, Jereb left Pitt and entered Timmy, enabling him to defeat Zoyvod. After the fight Timmy was kidnapped by the Creed. To affect his rescue, Pitt teamed up with Axiom - a New York-based superhero group. Pitt's half brother Wroth was working with Professor Holdsworth, the leader of Axiom. Holdsworth wanted the power in Timmy, and Wroth wanted Pitt. Their plan was foiled, however. Holdsworth's fate was not revealed but Wroth escaped [6-8]. He returned later and was defeated by Zoyvod who had taken over Pitt's body for a short while. Due to the war between the Creed and the Cenobite, Pitt would have been attacked by the Cenobite, had they found him on Earth. The Cenobite Eurial therefore hid him in an alternate dimension known as Shimmerspace until they were gone. There, Pitt met Jereb again. While in Shimmerspace, Jereb could see all time at once: past, present, and future. He told Pitt some of the things that would happen to him. Pitt was only in Shimmerspace very shortly but when he came out, five years had passed on Earth. While Pitt had been in Shimmerspace, an organization bent on world domination known as the ThinkTank had created Pitt clones - one of which was sent to steal some alien artifacts from a military installation. For this, the U.S. Army sent both troops and their best officer Captain Curtis to kill Pitt. They only succeeded in killing Captain Curtis and the US soldiers, and Pitt went to the White House where he killed Bill Clinton's double on the lawn. Pitt somehow found out about the ThinkTank being behind it all and went to the Crossbow Technologies building where he killed their leaders, the Guileys.  Powers  Pitt has vast super strength, he uses pain as a stimulant; and can leap 10 km in one bound. He also has razor sharp claws that tear through most, possibly all substances. Pitt has some durability, being able to survive attacks that would kill or disable superhuman beings with relative ease; and can heal near fatal wounds very quickly. He has limited psychic powers (mind reading), and uses his opponents' aggression to lock-on to his enemies.

She was the United States Ambassador to Estonia from 2004 until early December 2006, the fifth U.S. ambassador since the country regained its independence in 1991. From 2013 until 2015, she was Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Since May 2017, Wos has served as vice-chairwoman of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships, which is tasked with reviewing candidates for White House fellowships. Early life and medical career Wos is the daughter of Wanda and Paul Zenon Wos. Wos's father was part of the Home Army during the German and Soviet occupation of Poland in World War II and her Catholic family helped twelve Jews escape the Warsaw Ghetto. Wos's grandmother and aunts were imprisoned in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, while her father and grandfather, Paul Wos, Sr., were held in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. They survived to be reunited after the Allied Forces liberated the concentration camps. Aldona Wos was born in 1955 in Warsaw, where she lived until the age of six when her family moved to Long Island, New York. Wos earned a medical degree from Warsaw Medical Academy. While it is reported that she returned to New York to complete her residency and fellowship with a specialty in lung diseases Wos practiced medicine in Manhattan for eighteen years. Political career In 1997, Wos left her medical practice and moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, with her husband Louis DeJoy, who was CEO of New Breed Logistics Inc. from 1983 to 2014. In North Carolina, she and her husband have organized and hosted fundraisers for a number of national and state-level political campaigns, and have been significant contributors to several Republican candidates. Wos raised nearly $1 million for the campaign to elect Elizabeth Dole to the U.S. Senate in the 2002 elections and served as vice chairwoman of George W. Bush's North Carolina fundraising organization. In May 2002, Wos was appointed to a seat on the board of directors of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. President George W. Bush re-appointed her to second term on the council beginning in 2004. In June 2004, President Bush appointed Wos as the U.S. Ambassador to Estonia. She was sworn in on August 13, 2004. As ambassador to Estonia, she helped organize the state visit of President Bush to Estonia, which took place on 27th and 28 November 2006. For her efforts in facilitating US cooperation with the Estonian police, she was awarded a special police medal, given to her by Raivo Aeg, the head of the Estonian Police. She left her diplomatic post in December 2006. In March 2007, Polish President Lech Kaczynski awarded Wos the Commander Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. Wos was part of the second campaign to elect Pat McCrory as Governor of North Carolina. In May 2011, she hosted a luncheon for the Women for Pat McCrory in the lead-up to the former Mayor of Charlotte's announcement as a Republican candidate for the 2012 North Carolina gubernatorial election. She later served as co- chairwoman for the campaign and after McCrory's win, she was a part of his transition team. In June 2012, Wos was appointed to the board of governors of the University of North Carolina by the state's Republican-controlled General Assembly.  Secretary of North Carolina Health and Human Services  In December 2012, North Carolina Governor-elect Pat McCrory announced that Wos will be a member of his Cabinet as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Wos declined her $128,000 salary and was instead paid a token $1. On January 31, 2013, a performance audit was released, criticizing the previous administration's lack of record keeping concerning various funds, as well as naming other budgetary problems. Wos released her responses to the audit in an appendix, agreeing on all points with the auditor, including the conclusion that DHHS had consistently exceeded budgeted amounts for administrative costs due to lack of oversight by the previous administration. When speaking to the General Assembly in February 2013, Wos laid out her department priorities as \\"Medicaid and information technology.\\" In April 2013, Wos announced the governor's plan to overhaul the Medicaid system in North Carolina which she and McCrory criticized as \\"broken\\". This early plan would have brought in a few \\"entities ‚Äî likely including private companies ‚Äî to function as insurance companies for Medicaid recipients.\\" These entities would operate state-wide and serve as insurance plans from which Medicaid recipients can choose. The plan faced criticism from healthcare professionals who were concerned that it would permit \\"out-of-state and for-profit providers to get a major foothold in North Carolina, rather than letting proven in-state and nonprofit providers, such as Community Care of N.C., take the lead\\". At least one public health expert alleged that the Medicare crisis was contrived in order to justify privatization. Additionally, an investigation in North Carolina Health News alleged that McCrory, Wos and Medicaid head Carol Stickel withheld information that would have shown that North Carolina Medicaid administrative costs were lower than those of most other states, rather than 30% higher as alleged by the McCrory administration. The overhaul plan suffered an additional setback when the person hired to spearhead it, Carol Steckel, resigned in September 2013 to join the private sector. The state chose not to implement the proposed plans. In July 2013, DHHS went live with its NCTracks system for managing Medicaid billings, a system contracted in 2008 under the previous administration. By October, the system was facing criticism from health care providers that were concerned that the system was not reimbursing them quickly enough. In January 2014, an error in the system caused the private medical information of almost 49,000 children to be mailed to the wrong addresses. Throughout 2013 and early 2014, DHHS worked to resolve glitches with the NCTracks Medicaid billing system. The department announced that the system was working effectively by July 2014. Wos stated that she was disappointed that the state elected not to move forward with her proposal to reform the state's entire Medicaid program. By 2015, DHHS announced that the glitches in NCTracks were resolved, and Wos had \\"[convinced] the legislature of the need to invest in the state's medical examiner system.\\" Also in the summer of 2013, DHHS began processing SNAP food stamp applications through its new integrated NC FAST system. Due to various glitches there were almost immediate delays in families receiving food stamps. A number of food stamp recipients were forced to go to food kitchens while their benefits were processed. The delays were very persistent, and on January 24, 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture sent a letter to Wos stating that as of that date, North Carolina had a backlog of 20,243 SNAP cases that had not been processed within the 30 day deadline required by US law. 11,493 of these cases were over 60 days old, 8,002 were over 90 days old, and 5,934 were over 120 days old. 8,963 of these cases were categorized as \\"hardship\\" cases, where the processing deadline is 7 days because the applicant has very little income. USDA threatened to withhold funding from DHSS on March 12, 2014, if the agency did not come into compliance. On April 16, 2016, Wos announced, and USDA confirmed, that DHHS had come into compliance with federal timeliness guidelines. In August of 2013, Wos faced criticism for hiring two young former McCrory campaign workers, and giving them large pay raises at a time when McCrory had declared a salary freeze for state employees. 24-year-old Matthew McKillip was named Chief Policy Advisor to Wos, having worked for McCrory's campaign, and having previously served as a research assistant for eleven months at the conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute. McKillip received a $22,500 raise in April of 2013, bringing his salary to $87,500. DHHS Communications Director Ricky Diaz, also 24 and also a former McCrory campaign worker, received a $23,000 raise in April, bringing his salary to $85,000 per year. Diaz resigned from the department in January of 2014. Wos resigned on August 15, 2015, stating in a press conference that it was \\"simply time to go home\\" and spend time with her family. Asked by the press if she would \\"change any of the decisions that she made over a sometimes rocky tenure,\\" she replied, \\"not at all.\\" Wos was replaced by Rick Brajer, a former medical technology executive. After being sworn in, Brajer asserted to the press that Wos's resignation was unrelated to the ongoing federal investigation into DHHS. In August 2016, federal officials ended the investigations into employee and consultant contracts \\"with no finding of criminal wrongdoing\\". Although Wos's tenure as secretary earned criticism for issues such as computer glitches, McCrory praised how she \\"streamlined\\" the health care delivery systems. McCrory also praised Wos for the state's $130 million Medicaid budget surplus during her tenure, after years of major budget shortfalls. For her service to the state, McCrory awarded Wos with the Order of the Long Leaf Pine.  2015 to present  In May 2017, President Donald Trump appointed her his vice-chairwoman of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. The president uses the commission to interview and recommend candidates for White House fellowships. In June 2019, she was considered for the post of Ambassador to Canada.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trump-picks-former- bush-envoy-aldona-wos-as-next-ambassador-to-canada/ Trump announced his intent to nominate her on February 11, 2020.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/aldona- wos-new-us-ambassador-canada-1.5460207 On February 25, 2020, her nomination was sent to the Senate.\\"Eight Nominations Sent to the Senate\\", The White House, February 25, 2020 Her nomination is currently pending before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  Personal life  Wos and her husband Louis DeJoy have twin children and live in Greensboro, North Carolina, in an Irving Park Neighborhood home, which has been the location of several notable political fund-raising events. Her husband donated $747,000 to Duke University in 2014, funding Blue Devil Tower and the DeJoy Family Club at the football stadium. The same year, their son was accepted to the school and joined the school's tennis team as a walk-on. Wos has been involved in efforts to raise money for a number of nonprofit organizations and private schools as well. She served on the board of the United Way of Greater Greensboro, and has been involved with the Family Services of the Piedmont, Hospice and Palliative Care of Greensboro, and the Triad Stage Theatre. She was also instrumental in raising the finances for the Greensboro Ballet gala, held in February 2011, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the ballet company and school once attended by her children. Wos and DeJoy also founded The Louis DeJoy and Aldona Z. Wos Family Foundation which awards several scholarships to students. The foundation also hosts a professional‚Äìamateur golf championship as a prelude to the Wyndham Championship. ReferencesExternal links * Official website of The Louis DeJoy and Aldona Z.

Published in the United Kingdom, it was a largely Anglo-American intellectual and cultural journal, originally associated with the anti-Stalinist left. The magazine received covert funding from the Central Intelligence Agency, after the CIA and MI6 discussed the founding of an \\"Anglo-American left-of-centre publication\\" intended to counter the idea of Cold War neutralism. The magazine was rarely critical of American foreign policy and generally shaped its content to support the geopolitical interests of the United States government. Spender served as literary editor until 1967, when he resigned;. the revelation of the covert CIA funding of the magazine occurred that year. He had heard rumours, but had not been able to confirm. Thomas W. Braden, who headed the CIA's International Organizations Division's operations between 1951 and 1954, said that the money for the magazine \\"came from CIA, and few outside the CIA knew about it. We had placed one agent in a Europe-based organization of intellectuals called the Congress for Cultural Freedom.\\" Frank Kermode replaced Spender, but he too resigned when it became clear the CIA was involved.Sir Frank Kermode obituary. The Guardian. Roy Jenkins noted that earlier contributors were aware of U.S. funding, but believed it came from philanthropists including a Cincinnati gin distiller. Encounter celebrated its greatest years in terms of readership and influence under Melvin J. Lasky, who succeeded Kristol in 1958 and would serve as the main editor until the magazine ceased publication in 1991. Other editors in this period included D. J. Enright.  Background and related intellectual journals  In the Anglo- American context, the weeklies Spectator and the New Statesman, nominally if broadly Tory and Labour, respectively, remain the most prominent such journals in Britain, with both their stateside counterparts, The Nation and The New Republic, on the other hand, said to represent the liberal point of view. Other \\"little magazines\\" include the American quarterly Partisan Review (1933‚Äì2003), whose inaugural decades of distinction were marked by a devotion to Marxist or Trotskyist ideals in politics and to high modernism in the arts.  Founding and first editors  The launch in October 1953 of Encounter, a monthly Anglo-American journal of politics and culture, was sponsored by the Paris-based Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). The CCF was an organization of largely centre-left artists and intellectuals founded in 1950 . It was dedicated, in line with its title, to countering on behalf of the non- communist West the overtures and influence in culture of the Soviet Union, still under the Communist Party rule of Joseph Stalin until 1953. The covert partial funding of Encounter by the Central Intelligence Agency (and Britain's MI6), via such American organizations as the Farfield Foundation, and thence to the CCF, was revealed in 1967 in the pages of Ramparts,http://www.unz.org/Pub/Ramparts-1967mar-00029 The New York Times, and the Saturday Evening Post. It has since been a major source of controversy; the actual contents of the magazine, have often figured as relative footnotes. Those show shifting patterns of high-journalistic political allegiance, most notably in the cultural sphere. Shifts on both sides of the Atlantic triggered by the rise of the \\"neoconservative\\" tendency in opposition to the prevailing left-liberalism in elite opinion are visible. The choices for the first two Encounter co-editors, the American political essayist Irving Kristol (1920‚Äì2009) and the English poet Stephen Spender (1909‚Äì95) were telling, and in retrospect can be seen to have set in template much of the course of the magazine's evolution even over its final twenty-three years succeeding the resignation in 1967, after the CIA-funding revelation, of Spender.  Irving Kristol and the New York intellectuals  Irving Kristol edited the political articles in Encounter from 1953 until 1958, and though still a self-described liberal then, was already laying the foundations of his eventual stance, from the late 1970s until his death in 2009, as the \\"godfather of neoconservatism\\". Blooded in the legendary alcoves of the City College of New York cafeterias of the late 1930s, where Marxist and Trotskyist and Stalinist squabbled and subdivided far into the night, and eventually after their BAs, even further into the pages of Partisan Review, Kristol had already, as of 1952, in his writings in Commentary during the McCarthy years, set the tone for the neo- populist critique of liberal \\"new class\\" elites he would later seed during his almost forty-year stint (1965‚Äì2002) as founding co-editor of The Public Interest, the public-policy quarterly.  Stephen Spender and the English literary legacy  Stephen Spender cut a larger figure in strictly cultural circles, though with strong political engagements of his own ‚Äì he was, at 44, one of England's leading and eventually-canonic men of letters of his generation, having been a prime constituent of the fabled 1930s \\"MacSpaunday\\" generation of young English poets whose other members included Louis MacNeice, W.H. Auden, and C. Day Lewis. During his brief Communist phase in the 1930s, he had served in the Spanish Civil War with the anti-Franco International Brigades, and later contributed to the essay collection The God That Failed (1949) edited by Richard Crossman. The other contributors who had become disillusioned with Communism included Louis Fischer, Andr√© Gide, Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, and Richard Wright; Koestler and Silone would in turn become from its outset regular contributors to Encounter. Spender's apprenticeship in the editor's chair had come over a decade before when he served as deputy to the English aesthete Cyril Connolly in editing, for its first two years, the influential literary monthly Horizon (1940‚Äì49), many of whose writers would show up in Encounter in due course throughout the 1950s and after. Spender's range of cultural contacts, in and out of the academic world, combined with the high-stakes sense of Cold War cultural mission driving the Paris-based CCF, enabled Encounter to publish, especially during its first fourteen years prior to the revelation of the early CIA funding and the high-profile defections so provoked, an international range of poets, short-story writers, novelists, critics, historians, philosophers and journalists, from both sides of the Iron Curtain. The long tail of the Bloomsbury, World War I and Bright Young Things generations of the early 20th century was a marked feature of the early years of Spender's tenure atop the Encounter literary pages, chockablock with assorted Graveses,. Huxleys,. Mitfords,. Russells,. Sitwells,. Stracheys, Waughs and Woolfs ‚Äì Virginia in posthumous diary form,. her surviving husband Leonard as political essayist and reviewer..  Celebrity dons  Encounter provided a prime forum for celebrity academics from the faculties of Oxford, Cambridge, and London‚ÄîIsaiah Berlin, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and A. J. P. Taylor among them‚Äîwho discussed European history and the great thinkers helping to shape it. Trevor-Roper launched noted attacks, one on Arnold Toynbee's bestselling ten-volume Study of History, and on The Origins of the Second World War by A. J. P. Taylor. Celebrated early outings by Encounter belletrists came when Nancy Mitford. and Evelyn Waugh. playfully debated over successive issues the fine points of upper-class vs. lower-class English usage (\\"U and non-U\\"), as did C. P. Snow... and others,. if less playfully, Snow's depiction within of a yawning chasm of mind between the \\"Two Cultures\\" of the hard sciences and the humanities. Among the magazine's early luminaries in aesthetics and the history of art were Stuart Hampshire. and Richard Wollheim..For a superbly entertaining series of essays profiling a number of the prime controversies exercising the leading British historians and philosophers who were among the core contributors to Encounter in these years, see , a gifted young Indian- American writer for The New Yorker.  Political contours  On the political side of Encounter, Kristol brought on board many members of the group usually known as The New York Intellectuals, both journalist, literary and polemical or social-scientific, among whom he had passed the years of his apprenticeship: the sociologists Daniel Bell. and Nathan Glazer,. who, respectively, would later serve as his successive co-editors (and, like Spender, political foils, especially in Bell's more pronounced case) at The Public Interest, Sidney Hook,. and, not least, the ideological hummingbird and scourge of \\"Midcult\\" Dwight Macdonald,. who spent a year (1955‚Äì56) in London as Associate Editor, a tenure with which he would later attempt to make a retrospective reckoning in his \\"Politics\\" column in Esquire for June 1967 in what he would describe several months later as his \\"Confessions of an Unwitty CIA Agent\\"... Mainline Americans for Democratic Action-style left-liberal Democrats such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.. and John Kenneth Galbraith. rounded out the American contours in politics, while the early English contributions in politics came largely from the social-democratic, anti-Communist, anti- unilateral nuclear disarmament wing of the Labour fold, as represented by C.A.R. Crosland (Anthony Crosland). (a close friend of Daniel Bell), R.H.S. (Richard) Crossman,. and David Marquand,. with such occasional heterodox and erudite Conservative journalists as Peregrine Worsthorne. and the young Henry Fairlie. broadening the coverage. Encounter provoked controversy, with some British commentators arguing the journal took an excessively deferential stand towards United States foreign policy.Saunders, Frances Stonor. Who Paid the Piper?: The CIA and the Cultural Cold War. Granta Books, 1999, (pp. 187-88). Cambridge literary critic Graham Hough described the magazine as \\"that strange Anglo-American nursling\\" which had \\"a very odd concept of culture indeed\\". The Sunday Times referred to Encounter as \\"the police-review of American-occupied countries\\". Discussing the Encounter of the 1950s, Stefan Collini wrote that although Encounter was not \\"narrowly sectarian in either political or aesthetic terms, its pages gave off a distinct whiff of Cold War polemicizing\\".Stefan Collini, Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006, (p. 145).  Melvin Lasky and the 1960s  The transition to Kristol's replacement on the political side of Encounter in 1958 by Melvin J. Lasky (1920-2004) was seamless, and a key factor both in the broadening of the magazine's international scope to include a deeper extension of its European coverage, from the Soviet bloc not least, as well as its coverage of the newly decolonized nations of Africa and Asia. After combat with the 7th army and postwar service in Berlin under military governor Lucius Clay, Lasky founded the German-language monthly Der Monat (The Month), and, amid an adult life spent largely ever since in Germany, was enlisted in 1955 back in New York to edit the first two numbers of The Anchor Review (1955‚Äì57), an annual published by the new Anchor Books imprint of Doubleday, fruit of the 1950s quality-paperback revolution spearheaded by Jason Epstein, and whose international roster of high-humanist contributors ‚Äì Auden, Connolly, Koestler, Silone ‚Äì made it resemble a concurrent mini-Encounter.  Ties to Eastern Bloc resistance  During his 32 years at Encounter, Lasky, with his balding head and Van Dyke beard centrally cast as an inverted Lenin, proved instrumental in the long and dedicated cultivation of contacts from among the persecuted writers of Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and then-Yugoslavia, and devoted extensive front-cover coverage throughout the 1960s and 1970s to the judicial travails in Russia of Andrei Sinyavsky.. (aka \\"Abram Tertz\\", under which nom de plume several samizdat short stories appeared), Yuli Daniel, Joseph Brodsky. and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and in Poland to the case of Leszek Ko≈Çakowski,. the philosopher exiled to the West in 1968 by the Polish Communist Party, and who became one of the magazine's defining contributors, whose blend of intellectual history and anti-Soviet militancy made him a sort of Slavic cross between Isaiah Berlin and Sidney Hook. A special 65-page anthology in April 1963, \\"New Voices in Russian Writing,\\". presented, with the aid of translations by poets W. H. Auden, Robert Conquest, Stanley Kunitz and Richard Wilbur, a selection of the latest works of the rising generation of Russian poets and short-story writers, among them Andrei Voznesensky, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and Vasily Aksyonov (\\"Matryona's Home,\\". the most-read short story by Solzhenitsyn, was held over till the next issue).  Focus on decolonized nations  As for the nations of the so-called \\"developing world\\", thanks in part to Spender's early attention to matters echt-English, the aftermath of the British Empire not least, Indian affairs, especially as they involved writers and intellectuals, were prominent on the contents page, with the heterodox essayist and memoirist Nirad Chaudhuri. among the earliest of the magazine's long-serving correspondents from the subcontinent. Lasky, for his part, having written and published Africa For Beginners in 1962, made a point of devoting a special issue to that continent, along with others devoted to Asia and Latin America.  Changing times  Thanks in no small part to its glittering cultural content and the temper of the times it reflected, virtually the whole of the decade of the 1960s would prove to be the high-water mark of Encounters time on the world newsstand. As distinguished symposiasts from diverse spheres debated in its political sections such matters as the advisability of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community, the expansion of its tax-funded higher-education system, the aftermath of empire and the strains of assimilating the influx of immigrants from the decolonized nations, and the latest false dawn for socialists in Cuba, a rising generation of critics and scholars engaged the newly arrived high thinkers of the age ‚Äì Clifford Geertz, R.D. Laing, Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Konrad Lorenz, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Marshall McLuhan ‚Äì and speculated on the prospect of other false dawns in culture rather than politics. In the case of the imagined Arcadia presaged by the new wave of \\"high pornography\\", reformers like Olympia Press founder Maurice Girodias. weighed in for the defense, with conservative sociologist Ernest van den Haag. countering with a measured defense of the social need for both pornography and censorship, with the young George Steiner,. a Holocaust- haunted polymath of great erudition and mannered style, and a regular as of 1966 in both Encounter and the books pages of The New Yorker, dissenting from what to him seemed the neo-totalitarian import entailed by the literal stripping of literary characters of any vestige of privacy, in contrast to the more artful metaphoric indirections of such masters as Dante.  English poets  Encounter was eclectic in the poets it published. Its literary co-editors generally had a background in poetry, with Spender succeeded by the literary critic Frank Kermode. There were the critics, novelists and poets Nigel Dennis (1967‚Äì70) and D. J. Enright (1970‚Äì72), and the poet Anthony Thwaite (1973‚Äì85). Poets affiliated from the 1950s with The Movement ‚ÄîKingsley Amis, Robert Conquest, Donald Davie, Enright, Thom Gunn, Elizabeth Jennings, Philip Larkin, and John Wain‚Äìcontributed to the magazine, in many cases, in fiction and in essays also. Conquest, an independent historian of the Stalin years in Russia (The Great Terror, 1968), held a skeptical attitude toward facile left- liberalism. Amis published in Encounter in 1960 an article against the expansion of higher education, that proved influential.  Left-liberals vs. early neoconservatives  The more explicit development of that very skepticism, as it happened, came to mark the evolution of the political side of Encounter as it entered the 1970s and beyond. The ideological fissures in the world of Anglo-American political/literary journals began to see hairline crack turn to outright cleavage in the wake of the rise of the neoconservative movement. The biweekly New York Review of Books, founded in 1963, began to enlist from its outset a regular roster of the cream of the very sort of prestige British humanists and scientific essayists who had so distinguished themselves in the pages of Encounter in its first ten years, creating a rival outlet for them whose greater prominence in the much larger American market would only deepen after the 1967 high-profile resignations of Spender and Kermode, both of them at the very summit of Anglo-American literary life. The then largely intra-Democratic rifts issuing from reactions to, for instance, the Vietnam War, student radicalism and the New Left, urban strife, the Great Society, the rise of Black Power and affirmative action, played out on the contents pages of the highbrow journals in a sharpening of sides among the political contributors to the liberal-to-radical (in politics if not in art and literature) New York Review in opposition to the post-1970 rightward shift of Commentary under Norman Podhoretz; the New York Review had already as of its third year (1965, when Kristol and Bell founded The Public Interest) shed the future neoconservatives who had marked its first two years.Kristol contributed twice to the New York Review, in early 1964. His wife Gertrude Himmelfarb, the distinguished historian of Victorian England, wrote for it five times, ending in 1966; Norman Podhoretz once, in 1965; Podhoretz's wife Midge Decter three times through 1964. See Jacob Heilbrunn, \\"Norman's Conquest: Why Rudy Giuliani loves Norman Podhoretz ,\\" The Washington Monthly, December 2007; Merle Miller, \\"Why Norman and Jason Aren't Talking,\\" The New York Times Magazine, 26 March 1972. Another sign of the times came in 1972, when Daniel Bell, firmly of the social-democratic, anti-Stalinist, Old Left/Menshevik tendency, resigned from his co-editorship of The Public Interest, rather than strain his long friendship with Irving Kristol, who had recently left the Democratic fold and come out for Richard Nixon, easing into his final four decades in the ideological orbit of, e.g., the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. Some among the nascent neoconservatives, like Bell's successor Nathan Glazer, would remain loyal Democrats, while others would form the advance intellectual guard of the Reagan Democrats who played a pivotal role in the 1980 and 1984 elections.  Autonomy of art  At Encounter these cleavages played out in a rather less ruptured, more gradual, more diversified and less overtly hostile manner. For one thing, its always- extensive literary pages retained a back-of-the-book autonomy, above the roiling polemical waters of the day, of a sort increasingly rare over time in Podhoretz's Commentary, in which the multiple-front assaults on the New Left, the counterculture, radical feminism, Cold War dovishness, and other such deviations came to assume a monolithic editorial supremacy ‚Äî \\"culture war is hell and there are no aesthetes in a foxhole\\", as Franklin Foer put it in 1997.. By contrast, Encounter retained until its end of days a pronounced overlap with the artistically-conservative focus, in both topics and often in contributors, of the formally artistic and historical side of the New York Review ‚Äî divers dons from Oxbridge and London assaying the latest English literary biographies, the latest historians' \\"storms over the gentry\\" of seventeenth-century England, and, as always, new poetry and fiction. Even in its formally political content, though, Encounter, no doubt in part as the result of its base in London rather than in New York, played something of an ongoing mediator's role vis-a-vis the squabbling left-liberals and neocon hatchlings, helping keep it in demand and clean and dry atop mid-Atlantic coffee tables otherwise subject stateside to the detritus of splashed cabernet and flung brie. Though the student revolts of the late 1960s drew sharp rebukes in Encounter from the likes of Sidney Hook, and Robert Nisbet,.. the editors did not see fit to throw out the humanist baby with the radical bathwater, and so, for example, the socialist critic Irving Howe, editor of Dissent and an Old Left stalwart, was still, with such contributions as a discerning essay on Zola,. still very much representative of a central tradition within of socially engaged criticism that was to those in the Encounter orbit, at once critical of the injustices of the status quo yet firmly anti-fanatic, anti-totalitarian and fiercely resistant to forms of radicalism that, especially in the academy, sought to \\"revise\\" Stalin back into favor..  1970s  The economic sclerosis of the 1970s, afflicting all the world's advanced democracies with a corrosive blend of decade-long inflation, sector-wide industrial strikes, overburdened welfare states expanded under pressure of an affluence-driven \\"revolution of rising expectations\\", the overturning of the supremacy of Keynesian economics under a simultaneous inflation and recession long thought inconceivable, and the resulting unraveling of the postwar, bipartisan social-democratic consensus ‚Äì such was the stuff of a good portion of the debate on domestic affairs within Encounter throughout the 1970s. Those from the center-left addressing such topics included the veteran analysts of capitalism Andrew Shonfield. and Robert Skidelsky, biographer of Keynes, and economic historian of Depression Britain. Among those from the developing New Right to assail eminent thinkers leftward was the Australian-born LSE political scientist Kenneth Minogue, among whose many contributions was a stinging rebuke to John Kenneth Galbraith for offering, in his 1977 documentary series The Age of Uncertainty, far more wit than wisdom. ‚Äì a charge to which the Harvard economist replied, wittily.. Ferdinand Mount, novelist and political writer, then in his thirties and later to serve as a Thatcherite policy adviser early the next decade, did regular double duty as political essayist and book reviewer. And thirty years after The Road to Serfdom had made the name of Friedrich A. Hayek known among the non-economist educated public, the Austrian-born thinker, in the decade that saw his writings earn him both the Nobel Prize in Economics and a starring role in the education of the English prime minister newly arrived at its end, contributed four essays in the history of ideas, among them one on \\"The Miscarriage of the Democratic Ideal\\". and another on his cousin Ludwig Wittgenstein.. Shirley Robin Letwin took the American liberal legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin to task for promoting judicial activism in his signature work Taking Rights Seriously,. while the young conservative philosopher Roger Scruton,. a recent Encounter hand, examined the cultural roots of latter-day ills, and economist EJ Mishan. assayed the parasitic moral hazards arising from economic growth. And lively debate over the North-South divide, the Brandt Report, and western foreign aid to the Third World was on hand courtesy of the prestigious development economist Peter Bauer. and his critics.  Hazards of detente  In foreign affairs in the 1970s, Encounters prime interests, along with Euro-terrorism and Euro-communism, included the strains upon the detente with the Soviet Union inaugurated during the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford years posed by the military buildup and underlying intentions, conventional and nuclear, of the Soviet Union, the latter's renewed adventurism-by-proxy in the Middle East and in Africa, and its ongoing abuses in human rights and in the coerced psychiatric treatment of dissidents. One of the prime set-pieces among the hawk-vs-dove needle-matches underway came with a six-installment series in which the eminent diplomat- historian ‚Äî and \\"containment\\" theorist of the first years of the Cold War ‚Äî George F. Kennan,... then in his early seventies, squared off against his critics in the form of several interviews he had granted to George Urban of Radio Free Europe, with detailed rejoinders ‚Äî and another mutual follow-up round ‚Äî in succeeding issues by the veteran historian of the Russian empire at the University of London's School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies, Hugh Seton-Watson,. by Richard Pipes of Harvard.. ‚Äî the latter due in several years for a post helping Ronald Reagan plot strategy toward the Soviet Union ‚Äî and Leopold Labedz,.. Polish-born editor of Survey, a quarterly journal of Soviet-bloc affairs. The exchanges, marked each time on the part of Kennan's critics by a ritual and almost incantatory deference to his stature and role as almost Old Testament wise man, grew increasingly testy on both sides, with Seton-Watson accusing Kennan of allowing his aristocratic-utopian hand- wringing over Western cultural degeneracy to vanquish his sense of the moral urgency and legitimacy of the west's need to better defend itself against a newly hardened foe, with Pipes accusing him of an overly-optimistic estimate of relaxation in Soviet military strategy since the death of Stalin, charges amplified by Labedz. Kennan, for his part in reply, fired back from several angles with a long-running complaint of his, perhaps best summarized as: nobody understands me.  Rising talent on the literary side  The range of literary figures, some young and others established, whose first contributions to Encounter came during the 1970s included novelists Martin Amis, Italo Calvino, Elias Canetti, Margaret Drabble, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Paul Theroux, D.M. Thomas, William Trevor, critics and essayists Clive James, Gabriel Josipovici, Bernard Levin, David Lodge, Jonathan Raban, Wilfrid Sheed, Gillian Tindall, poets Alan Brownjohn, Douglas Dunn, Gavin Ewart, James Fenton, Seamus Heaney, Erica Jong, Michael Longley, John Mole, Blake Morrison, Andrew Motion, Tom Paulin, Peter Porter, Peter Reading, Peter Redgrove, Vernon Scannell, George Szirtes, and R. S. Thomas.  1980s and end of the Cold War  The final decade for Encounter, the 1980s, was marked by regular elegy for old and distinguished friends of the magazine who had aged along with it, chief among them the Hungarian-born novelist and polymath Arthur Koestler.. and the influential French political philosopher and journalist Raymond Aron.... Longtime social-democrat friend of the magazine Sidney Hook died at 86 in July 1989, missing by less than six months the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe, previewed his memoir Out of Step: An Unquiet Life in the Twentieth Century. in Encounter in the mid-1980s. As Brezhnev gave way to Andropov, then to Chernenko and finally to Gorbachev, such contributors as former Labour cabinet secretary (Lord) Alun Chalfont... were dedicated to exposing what they saw as the errors of assorted unilateralist disarmers in the peace movement and foes of nuclear deterrence such as the English historian E.P. Thompson, as the NATO agreement to counteract Soviet SS-20s in the European theater took shape. The Polish resistance still covertly active after the crushing of the Solidarity trade union movement by martial law received ongoing coverage. Encounters range of political contributors edged closer to the stateside neoconservative orbit found in the 1980s grouped round, such as Commentary, the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, and the American Spectator. Edward Pearce, a regular contributor to the magazine in the 1980s, claims that Encounter's editors reassigned him from political writing to theatre criticism after he repeatedly used his Encounter column to criticise the Thatcher government. Though the literary side of Encounter throughout the 1980s featured a far smaller proportion of writers at the forefront of their national literatures as had its 1960s incarnation under Stephen Spender, and a 1983 change in cover design scrapped its austere \\"Continental\\" template in favor of a glossy look more characteristic of proverbially \\"slick\\" periodicals familiar from American newsstands, given the lofty heights from which it would recede, it still sustained its nonpolitical autonomy and ample proportions when the English poet Anthony Thwaite was replaced in 1985 by Richard Mayne, an English journalist, broadcaster, translator from the French, the magazine's Paris correspondent and \\"M.\\" columnist, and former assistant to Jean Monnet, architect of the European Economic Community. Encounter published its final issue in September 1990, almost a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communist rule in the European satellites, and a year before the largely peaceful demise of Soviet rule itself. The magazine's end was brought about due to its increasing debts.  Recognition  Thanks to the uncommon distinction, disciplinary and geographic range of the contributors it brought together in one venue, especially during the years 1953‚Äì67 prior to the CIA-funding revelations, Encounter earned regard as a high-water mark in postwar periodical literature. In a review of recent work by Stephen Spender in The New Republic in 1963, the American poet John Berryman wrote, \\"I don't know how Spender has got so many poems done, especially because he does many things besides write poetry: he is a brilliant and assiduous editor (I would call Encounter the most consistently interesting magazine now being published).\\". In the early 1970s, the American monthly Esquire said of Encounter that it was \\"probably not as good now as when it was backed by the CIA, but [it is] still the best general monthly magazine going.\\"Quoted in the entry for .. In the late 1970s, The Observer wrote that \\"Encounter is a magazine which constantly provides, in any given month, exactly what a great many of us would have wished to read... there is no other journal in the English-speaking world which combines political and cultural material of such consistently high quality\\", while the International Herald Tribune called Encounter \\"one of the few great beacons of English-language journalism... a model of how to present serious writing.\\"Both quotes appeared in advertisements for Encounter run in numerous English periodicals of the time, e.g., in . In a review in 2011 in The New Republic of a posthumous collection of essays by Irving Kristol, Franklin Foer wrote that \\"Encounter... deserve[s] a special place in the history of the higher journalism... [it] was some of the best money that the [CIA] ever spent. The journal, published out of London, was an unlikely coupling of the New York intelligentsia with their English counterparts‚Äîan exhilarating intermarriage of intellectual cultures. I am not sure that any magazine has ever been quite so good as the early Encounter, with its essays by Mary McCarthy and Nancy Mitford, Lionel Trilling and Isaiah Berlin, Edmund Wilson and Cyril Connolly. In his typically self- effacing manner, Kristol heaped credit upon Spender for the achievement.\\".

It is about a Secret Service agent (Don DeFore) who goes undercover and moves into a hotel run by a beautiful female manager (Andrea King), so that he can investigate a counterfeiting ring. The agent is up against hardened felons such as the gang member played by George Tobias, an unusual example of casting against type for the typically comic actor. It is one of Ingster's two film noirs, the other being Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), which is considered the first noir film. Plot Based on a true story, the US Secret Service searches for a gang of counterfeiters, whose brilliant engraver Eugene Deane (Morris Ankrum) has secretly made his plates while in San Quentin prison on a life sentence, and had them smuggled out by a priest tricked into serving as a mule. The film starts as documentary-style section in which a male narrator explains the crucial role of paper currency in underpinning trade in the economy. Then the narrator explains how the US Treasury Department ensures that the value of this currency is safeguarded by using its intrepid Secret Service agents, who find fake bills in circulation and track down and arrest the counterfeiters who created them. This part of the film, which has a patriotic and jingoistic feel, shows newsreel-style stock footage of Treasury Department agents (\\"T-Men\\") and US soldiers fighting in the then-active Korean War. When counterfeit $10 bills spread across the country, showing up at casinos and racetracks, the Treasury Department realizes that the bills are Deane's work. The officers set up surveillance on the counterfeit gang and find a travelling salesman who has been distributing the bills across the country, hoping to capture and interrogate him. However, a ruthless member of the counterfeiting gang (George Tobias) gets to the salesman first and kills him by throwing him out a window before he can talk and possibly lead the agents to the gang. The Secret Service then puts undercover agent John Riggs (Don DeFore) on the case. Riggs poses as a thief who is interested in buying and selling counterfeit bills, to learn more about the gang and gather evidence. Riggs works the clues, which leads him to a Los Angeles hotel where the dead salesman lived. Riggs moves into the hotel as part of his undercover work, where he gets recruited by gang members. He also meets the beautiful hotel manager, Nora Craig (Andrea King). While Riggs is romantically attracted to Craig, he also realizes that she may be connected to the counterfeiting gang. Riggs finds out that Craig is not only the manager of the hotel, but also the boss of the counterfeiting gang, commanding a crew of hardened felons. He finds out that her father is Deane, the old engraver in prison. The movie's climax arrives when the counterfeiters realize Riggs is a federal agent and threaten to kill him. As other federal agents and police invade the gang's lair, it ends up set on fire. The gang and officers have a pitched gun battle amidst cable car rail trestles and bridges, and Craig plunges to her death.

It was the last in a series of movies King Brothers made for Allied Artists. Reception A November 1950 review in The New York Times commented: \\"In the cinema's library of routine gangster fiction, Southside 1-1000 merits a comfortable middle-class rating being neither especially exciting nor particularly dull\\". Film critic Craig Butler of Allmovie wrote, \\"Southside 1-1000 is a good pseudo-noir film told in pseudodocumentary fashion, but it also must register as a bit of a disappointment. It's functional and all the parts fit together smoothly, making it run like a fairly well-oiled machine -- but it lacks real spark. Given director Boris Ingster's impressive work on the seminal Stranger on the Third Floor, one expects something a bit more unusual or off the beaten path ‚Äì or at least distinctive. Instead, Southside looks like it could have been the work of any competent director\\".Butler, Craig. AllMovie, film/DVD review, no date. Accessed: August 19, 2013. Michael Barrett of PopMatters rated it 4/10 stars and called it \\"an unnecessary and forgettable entry in the genre\\".

He teaches international law, contract law, and bankruptcy, among other areas. As of 2014, he was the 4th most-cited legal scholar in the United States. He is the son of retired Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner. Education Posner attended Yale University (B.A. and M.A. degrees in philosophy, summa cum laude) and received his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude) in 1991. He clerked for Judge Stephen F. Williams of the D.C. Circuit. Career Posner started his teaching career at the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1993 to 1998. In 1998, Posner joined the University of Chicago Law School where is now the Kirkland and Ellis Distinguished Service Professor of Law. He has also been a visiting professor at Columbia Law School and NYU School of Law. From 1998 to 2011, he was an editor of The Journal of Legal Studies. He is the author or co-author of many books and articles, on subjects including international law, cost- benefit analysis, and constitutional law. Work Posner's published books have ranged over several topics including international law, foreign relations law, contracts, and game theory and the law. In 2005, Posner posted about the trial of the deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In June 2013, Posner and Jameel Jaffer, fellow at the Open Society Foundations, participated in The New York Times Room for Debate series. Posner responded to concerns about expanded National Security Agency (NSA) programs that vacuum information about the private lives of American citizens. Those who oppose the surveillance claim that the collection and storing of unlimited metadata is a highly invasive form of surveillance of citizens' communications. Posner claimed that Americans obtain the services they want by disclosing private information to strangers such as doctors and insurance companies. Posner in 2013 argued that since 2001 there had not been a single instance of \\"war-on-terror-related surveillance in which the government used information obtained for security purposes to target a political opponent, dissenter or critic\\". In 2015, Posner co-founded the book review The New Rambler. Posner's position concerning the heightened standing of the executive branch of government was criticized in 2016 by Jeremy Waldron in his book Political Political Theory as not sufficiently sensitive to issue of legislative priorities.Jeremy Waldron (2017). in his book Political Political Theory. Harvard University Press. 2016. Page 70. In 2018, Posner co-wrote an article advocating a system of market-oriented, privately sponsored work visas as a supplement to U.S. immigration policy.

Born in Gardenton, Manitoba, he moved to Ottawa when he was eighteen. He started his own company, Golden Ridge Developments Ltd. He is responsible for two suburban developments in the Ottawa area - the development of the former hamlet of Bells Corners, Ontario into a garden suburb (through the development of housing estates called Lynwood Park and Arbeatha Park in the early 1960s) - and the development of Beaverbrook, the beginning of the city of Kanata (later amalgamated into greater Ottawa) from a greenfield site in the Township of March, west of the Ottawa Greenbelt. From 1973 to 1979, he was the Chairman and President of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). In 1976, Teron served as Deputy Minister of the Ministry of State for Urban Affairs. He is the founder of Teron International Building Technologies. In 1982, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1978, he was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. He is also the recipient of the Silver, Gold and Diamond Queen's Jubilees medals and received the Jane Jacobs Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013. In 2014, Teron listed his home located in the Kanata Rockeries enclave off Goulbourn Forced Road for $2.75 million. The 5,600 square foot home is located on three-quarters of an acre and is part of the 13-acre parcel Teron kept for himself when he gave up developing his garden city of Beaverbrook in the early 1970s. The home was built in 2004 and was used as a test site to research new technology aimed at improving sustainability. The home is built on a private cul-de-sac. It resembles a series of silos in mirrored glass that feature green roofs, rainwater harvesting and a building block-type technology. The south side of the home is almost all glass, angled to reflect the sun's rays in the summer, but collect them in the winter. The north side is virtually buried in a hillside to insulate and allow nature to effectively obscure the home from public view.

He is an Orange, CA, resident and owns the Billy Zoom Custom Shop near Old Towne Orange, specializing in guitar amplifiers and similar gear. At 68 years old, Zoom was diagnosed in 2015 with an aggressive form of bladder cancer and began immediate treatment. He has since stated that he is \\"cancer-free\\" but will continue receiving chemotherapy treatments. Early life The son of a big band woodwinds player, Kindell began playing a variety of instruments, including violin, accordion, piano, clarinet, tenor, alto, and baritone saxophones, flute, banjo, and guitar. Upon moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s, he worked as a session guitarist while attending technical school for training in electronics repair. He has an insider's reputation as an expert in the maintenance, restoration, and modification of vintage tube amplifiers and combo organs. He has performed custom technical work on the amps for a host of electric guitarists and bassists. Career X in 2004 After submitting a string of demos to every record label he could find under his name Ty Kindell, he chose his stage name to get attention from executives who may have already rejected him. Although best known as guitarist and founding member of punk rock band X, Zoom has also worked with rockabilly legend Gene Vincent, The Blasters, Etta James, Big Joe Turner, Mike Ness, and dozens of other major recording artists. On stage, he is known for his wide-legged stance, big grin and tendency to make eye contact with audience members. He adopted this presence in reaction to many guitarists whose body histrionics and facial expressions gave the impression that they were playing very difficult parts on their instruments. Zoom wanted to make everything look easy. In June 2008, in honor of his contributions to both the world music community and the legacy of Gretsch guitars, Gretsch unveiled the G6129BZ Billy Zoom Custom Shop Tribute Silver Jet.

Known for most of its length as Joseph Biggs Memorial Highway, the state highway runs from MD 273 in Rising Sun east to MD 272 in Bay View. In conjunction with MD 272, MD 274 connects Rising Sun with Interstate 95 (I-95) in central Cecil County. The highway was built near Rising Sun in two segments, one before 1910 and the other in the mid-1920s. MD 274 was completed to Bay View in the early 1940s. The highway was relocated at Bay View in the late 1960s and reconstructed the rest of the way to Rising Sun in the late 1970s and early 1980s. MD 274 had a truck bypass using MD 273 and MD 272 via Calvert. Route description View east along MD 274 past MD 273 in Rising Sun MD 274 begins at an intersection with MD 273 (Main Street) in the town center of Rising Sun. The highway follows two-lane undivided Queen Street south to the town limit, where the route intersects the Octoraro Rail Trail. At this point, the highway continues southeast as Joseph Biggs Memorial Highway. The highway was named for Joseph B. Biggs, a county commissioner of Cecil County in the 1970s. MD 274 follows the ridge separating North East Creek to the northeast from Principio Creek and Stony Run to the southwest. The highway passes through the hamlets of Farmington and Greenhurst. In the latter hamlet, MD 274 intersects Calvert Road and parallels Ebenezer Church Road; the parallel segments of these roads are MD 274A and MD 274B. The highway passes the Chesapeake Bay Golf Club at Rising Sun and then intersects Old Farmington Road and Old Bayview Road in Bay View. There, MD 274 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 272 (North East Road) across from the entrance to Cecil College and a short distance north of MD 272's interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway). History A section of present-day MD 274 was constructed as a macadam road by Cecil County with state aid from Farmington north to Pierce Road south of Rising Sun by 1910. The gap between that section and MD 273 in Rising Sun was filled by 1927. MD 274 was extended southeast to Post Road near Greenhurst (also known as College Green) as a concrete road in 1929. The highway remained a spur from Rising Sun to Greenhurst until the highway to Bay View was completed in 1942. The first section of MD 274 to be placed in its modern form was the segment between Old Bay View Road, then MD 699, and modern MD 272; this piece was built in 1965. This highway was extended northwest to Old Farmington Road in 1968 and 1969. MD 274 was reconstructed from Post Road through Farmington to the town limit of Rising Sun between 1978 and 1980. The final stretch of MD 274 to be reconstructed was from Post Road to Bay View, which bypassed what is now Ebenezer Church Road at Greenhurst, between 1982 and 1984. Queen Street in Rising Sun was maintained by the town until the town's section of the state highway was transferred to state maintenance in a January 5, 1979, road transfer agreement. Junction listAuxiliary routes MD 274 has a pair of auxiliary routes around Greenhurst. These highways form much of the old alignment of MD 274 left behind when the highway was relocated there in the early 1980s. *MD 274A is the designation for Calvert Road, which runs from the intersection of MD 274 and MD 274B north and west to a dead end, between which the highway meets the southern end of county-maintained Calvert Road. *MD 274B is the designation for the state-maintained portion of Ebenezer Church Road. The state highway begins south of Principio Road, south of which Ebenezer Church Road becomes a county highway. MD 274B parallels MD 274 north to its terminus at MD 274 and MD 274A. Former truck route Maryland Route 274 Truck was a truck bypass of MD 274. The signed route followed MD 273 from MD 274's western terminus in Rising Sun east to MD 272 at Calvert and MD 272 from Calvert south to MD 274's eastern terminus in Bay View.

He is most famous as the lead singer and songwriter for Shack and The Pale Fountains, both of which also feature his younger brother John Head. Though the bands never achieved mainstream success, they have a strong following and NME have described him as \\"a lost genius and among the most gifted British songwriters of his generation\\". The Pale Fountains Head first gained attention as a member of The Pale Fountains in the early 1980s with his best friend Chris \\"Biffa\\" McCaffrey. The band suffered from critical and commercial apathy, and the band split around 1987. Shortly afterwards, McCaffrey died from a brain tumour. In 2008, Head reformed The Pale Fountains to play a couple of gigs to celebrate 25 years since their inception. Shack In 1986, Head formed Shack with John on lead guitar, Peter Wilkinson on bass and Mick Hurst on drums. The group debuted in 1988 with Zilch, falling victim to the commercial indifference which earlier plagued The Pale Fountains' career. The follow-up, Waterpistol, was recorded in 1991 at London's Star Street Studio, but shortly after the finished disc was mixed the studio burned to the ground, and the completed master was lost. Producer Chris Allison had the only surviving copy of the album, but unaware of a fire that demolished the studio, carelessly left his copy of the tape in a rental car while in the U.S.; upon returning to the UK and learning of the studio's fate he managed to contact the rental car company and rescue the DAT, but the record company had collapsed and there was no one to distribute it. Waterpistol was not released until 1995, by which point Shack had split up. The siblings reformed Shack soon after with bassist Ren Parry and drummer lain Templeton, returning in 1999 with H.M.S. Fable and Here's Tom With the Weather (2003). They signed to Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher's Sour Mash label and released ...The Corner Of Miles And Gil in 2006. A Best Of album, Time Machine was released in 2007. Michael Head introducing The Strands After touring for a while with childhood heroes Love, Head went on to form Michael Head introducing The Strands, again with brother John on guitar. In 1997, they released the critically acclaimed album The Magical World of the Strands. 2008 was a relatively quiet one for Head, starting with Shack being part of Liverpool, The Musical, which was part of the European City of Culture celebrations and ending with another new venture, Michael Head & The Red Elastic Band.  Michael Head & The Red Elastic Band  In September 2013, Michael Head & The Red Elastic Band released their debut record, an EP entitled Artorius Revisited, on Violette Records. Following this with a limited edition double A-side 7\\" single \\"Velvets In The Dark / Koala Bears\\" in March 2015. In October 2017, Michael Head & The Red Elastic Band released an album called Adi√≥s Se√±or Pussycat which reached No 1 in the Independent album charts and No 24 in the UK Albums Chart. In early 2019, Michael Head parted company with Violette Records, entering the studio in August of that year with producer and songwriter/musician Bill Ryder-Jones to begin recording a new album called New Brighton Rock. Four of the new songs were played live for the first time at Michael Head & The Red Elastic Band's first and only live show of 2019 at Liverpool's Invisible Wind Factory, generating a positive response on social media. 2019 also saw Michael Head begin working with his representative Daniel McEvoy, as well as updating fans directly for the first time through Twitter and Instagram.

They have a national telephone helpline (0300 688 0368 ) as well as several parent support groups and are a support group recognised by the UK Government. FFLAG also works outside the UK with other LGBT family support organisations particularly in Europe. Formation Members of FFLAG speaking in video Parents Talking c. 1990 Rose Robertson The organisation has its roots in 1965 when Rose Robertson (1916 - 2011), a former World War II SOE agent set up Parents Enquiry, inspired by events she had seen whilst working with the resistance in occupied France. Rose was herself heterosexual, her maiden name being Laimbeer, Rose had married George Robertson in 1954, he died in 1984. Rose launched Britain‚Äôs first helpline to assist, inform and support parents and their lesbian, gay and bisexual sons and daughters three years before the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised homosexuality in England and Wales in a period of severe Homophobia, when LGBT+ people regularly experienced prejudice, harassment and oppression. Rose used her own home and money to help young LGBT+ people in need. =Parents Enquiry= Rose Robertson was receiving over 100 phone calls and letters a week from highly distressed gay teenagers, many of whom had self harmed. Rose often mediated between parents mostly successfully, who had rejected their own sons and daughters due to sexuality. Despite being verbally abused, physically attacked, targeted with extreme homophobia and Right-wing extremists, arson attacks on her home, excrement through the letterbox, abusive phone calls and hate mail she did not give up and persevered until her death in helping young LGBT+ people. Obituaries to Rose appeared in The Telegraph, The Guardian and The Pink Paper news papers and at the Peter Tatchell Foundation. The Manchester Parents Group had produced a video introduced by Sir Ian McKellen in 1990 in which Rose Robertson appeared, one of the last surviving VHS Video copies, although in worn condition was transferred by a volunteer to Mpeg video in 1999 for preservation. National Movement The helpline that Rose created ran for three decades and Rose's work inspired parents in various parts of the country to set up their own groups and helplines. Among the first were those in Manchester, Leicester and Scotland. By 1993 it was felt that there was a need for a national organisation to act as an umbrella group to support and co- ordinate the local groups and to respond to the increasing request for information from the media, social services and other organisations and individuals. =FFLAG= 'Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays' (FFLAG) was the successor to Parents Enquiry set up in 1993, and became a registered charity in 2000 with aims were to support parents and their lesbian, gay and bisexual daughters and sons and to campaign for human and civil rights. FFLAG is a totally voluntary organisation; it has no statutory funding and is totally dependent on donations. The equal rights legislation FFLAG has campaigned for include: * The repeal of section 28 * Equalisation of the age of consent * Lifting the ban on gays and lesbians in the armed forces * Adoption rights for same sex couples * Civil partnership * Same sex marriage In 2000 FFLAG joined with parent's organisations in Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Spain to set up EuroFFLAG, now followed by the European Network of Parents of LGBTQI children. =FFLAG's vision= FFLAG's vision: is a world free from ignorance and prejudice about sexuality and gender identity in which LGBT+ people are valued and respected Their mission: To support families with LGBT+ members * To be the national umbrella organisation for affiliated groups supporting families with LGBT+ members * To support and develop a network of local family support groups * To provide direct individual support where local family support groups are not involved * To educate and advocate for a world in line with their vision * To work with other organisations to achieve their vision * To ensure that they have the necessary resources to achieve their mission =Support Resources= FFLAG's website provides information about helpful resources including their downloadable booklets. The booklet 'A Guide For Family & Friends' looks at issues and emotions that parents and families may face when their LGB loved one comes out. Another booklet 'How Do I Tell My Parents?' considers ways of telling parents as well as discussing the issues that often worry lesbian, gay and bisexual people when they want to talk to their family about their sexuality. The booklets, originally written by Rose Robertson, were rewritten by FFLAG Parents in 2012 and updated again in 2017. The booklets contain quotes and experiences from parents and LGB young people. FFLAG has found that many of the enquiries currently received are from parents of trans youngsters. They have decided to extend their remit to include support for family and friends of trans people. On 31 March 2018, coinciding with Trans Visibility Day, FFLAG launched its new booklet 'A Guide For Family & Friends - information for family and friends with a transgender member'. There are plans for a second new booklet 'How Do I Tell My Parents? - I'm transgender' to be available later this year. =Trustees= President of the organisation is Jenny Broughton, Hugh Fell is Chair of Trustee's alongside fellow Trustee's Sorrel Atkinson, Janet Kent, Hilary Beynon and Sarah Furley. =Patrons= Long standing Patrons of the organisation are Baron Cashman of Limehouse, Angela Mason CBE, Sir Ian McKellen CH CBE, Baroness Massey of Darwen, Professor Ian Rivers, Deidre Sanders and Peter Tatchell.

It breeds in south-eastern Siberia and Northern China before migrating in large flocks across India and over the Arabian Sea to winter in Southern Africa Description Males are characteristically dark sooty grey above with rufous thighs and vent. In flight, the wing lining is white, contrasting with the dark wing feathers. Adult males of the closely related red-footed falcon have a dark grey wing lining. In Africa, males can be confused with melanistic Gabar goshawks, but the chestnut on the vent is distinctive. Also, there may be some superficial resemblance to the sooty falcon and the grey kestrel, but those two species both have yellow feet and cere. The wings are long as in most falcons (with a span of 63‚Äì71 cm) and at rest the wing tip reaches or extends just beyond the tail-tip. Females can be more difficult to identify as they share a pattern common to many falcons, but are distinctive in having an orange eye-ring, a red cere and reddish orange feet. Juveniles can be confused only with those of the red-footed falcon, but lack the buffy underwing coverts. Taxonomy The Amur falcon was long considered a subspecies or morph of the red-footed falcon, but it is nowadays considered distinct. Nonetheless, it is the red-footed falcon's closest relative; their relationship to other falcons is more enigmatic. They appear morphologically somewhat intermediate between kestrels and hobbies and DNA sequence data has been unable to further resolve this question, mainly due to lack of comprehensive sampling.Wink, Michael; Seibold, I.; Lotfikhah, F. & Bednarek, W. (1998): Molecular systematics of holarctic raptors (Order Falconiformes). In: Chancellor, R.D., Meyburg, B.-U. & Ferrero, J.J. (eds.): Holarctic Birds of Prey: 29‚Äì48. Adenex & WWGBP. The genus name Falco is Late Latin and derives from falx, falcis, a sickle, referencing the claws of the bird. The species name amurensis is from Amurland in south-eastern Siberia. During the migration season; photographed at October end from Pangti, Nagaland, India. Now these birds have safe passage to south Africa tip. Distribution and migration The Amur falcon breeds in east Asia from the Transbaikalia, Amurland, and northern Mongolian region to parts of North Korea. They migrate in a broad front through India and Sri Lanka, sometimes further east over Thailand and Cambodia and then over the Arabian Sea, sometimes in passage on the Maldives and other islands to reach southern Africa. Birds going over India are thought to be aided by strong winds blowing westward. These winds are strong at an altitude of about 3000m and the birds are thought to fly at a height of above 1000m during migration. The route taken to return to their breeding grounds runs slightly more northward. Because of its tendency to wander long distances over the ocean while migrating, this falcon has been found in locations far outside its normal range, such as in Italy, Sweden, Tristan da Cunha, St. Helena and the United Kingdom. Behaviour and ecology=Foraging and food The Amur falcon feeds mainly late in the evening or early in the morning capturing a wide range of insects in the air or on the ground. They capture most of their prey in flight, sometimes by hovering, but will also pick prey by alighting on the ground. The winter diet appears to be almost entirely made up of insects but they take small birds, mammals and amphibians to feed their young in their breeding range. The rains in Africa produce swarms of termites, locusts, ants and beetles that provide ample food. Their migration over the Arabian Sea coincides with the timing of the migration of dragonflies (Pantala flavescens) and these are thought to provide food during the most arduous part of their migration route. Nesting Nesting pair with chicks During migration they stay in open forest or grasslands, roosting colonially on exposed perches or wires. Their breeding habitat is open wooded country with marshes. The breeding season is May to June and several pairs may nest close together. Abandoned nest platforms belonging to birds of prey or corvids and even tree hollows are re-used for nesting. Three or four eggs are laid (at two day intervals). Both parents take turns to incubate and feed the chicks which hatch after about a month. The young birds leave the nest after about a month. Parasites The Amur falcon hosts three species of lice, Degeeriella rufa, Colpocephalum subzerafae, and Laembothrion tinnunculi. Status and conservation The wide breeding range and large population size of the Amur falcon have led to the species being assessed as being of least concern. The flocking behaviour during migration and the density at which they occur, however, expose them to hunting and other threats. During their migration from their breeding area to the winter quarters, they are plump and are hunted for food in parts of northeastern India as well as in eastern Africa. In 2012, mass trapping and capture of migrating Amur falcons in Nagaland (India) was reported in the media and a successful campaign was begun to prevent their killing.Falcon preservationists As part of this campaign, three birds were fitted with 5 gm satellite transmitters that allowed them to be tracked during their migration.

Graham, Anderson, Probst & White (GAP&W;) was a Chicago architectural firm that was founded in 1912 as Graham, Burnham & Co. This firm was the successor to D. H. Burnham & Co. through Daniel Burnham's surviving partner, Ernest R. Graham, and Burnham's sons, Hubert Burnham and Daniel Burnham Jr. In 1917, the Burnhams left to form their own practice, which eventually became Burnham Brothers, and Graham and the remaining members of Graham, Burnham & Co. ‚Äì Graham, (William) Peirce Anderson, Edward Mathias Probst, and Howard Judson White ‚Äì formed the resulting practice. The firm also employed Victor Andre Matteson. Background Graham, Anderson, Probst & White was the largest architectural firm under one roof during the first half of the twentieth century. The firm's importance to Chicago's architectural legacy cannot be overstated, nor can its connection to Burnham. The firm was headquartered in Burnham's own Railway Exchange Building. In part from its connection to Burnham, the firm captured the majority of the big commissions from 1912 to 1936, including such iconic works as the Wrigley Building, Merchandise Mart, Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Civic Opera House, and the former central Chicago post office. Its only close rival was the equally prolific Holabird and Root. GAP&W; also created the iconic Terminal Tower in Cleveland and Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. Anderson died in 1924, with Graham and White following just weeks apart in 1936. Surviving partner Edward M. Probst took over the firm, assisted by his sons Marvin Probst and Edward E. Probst. After Mr. Probst's death in 1942, son Marvin G. Probst took over as firm president. Edward E. Probst left the firm about 1947. Just prior to Marvin Probst's death in 1970, the firm was sold to an employee, William R. Surman. From 1970 to 1993 William Surman was president of the firm. After his death in 1993, the practice was run by his son Robert Surman till the firm closed its doors in the fall of 2006. Early on, Graham, Anderson, Probst & White became known for its classical taste and the elegance of its Beaux-Arts- inspired output, which Louis Sullivan decried as a stylistic throwback but which nonetheless withstood multiple generations of critics. Those early buildings are still popular favorites today. However, starting in 1923 with the firm's plans for the Merchandise Mart and the Straus Building, the practice soon began to move beyond the Beaux-Arts influence of Burnham and the City Beautiful movement to the bolder, starker Art Deco style with its streamlined forms. The firm's ultimate expression of the Art Deco style was found in its design of the 1931 Field Building (later known as the La Salle Bank Building), which was a commission from the estate of department store magnate Marshall Field. It was matched that year by Holabird and Root's equally stunning Chicago Board of Trade Building. After 1931, GAP&W; for the most part stopped referencing the Beaux-Arts style.

Currently vacant. Architectural sculpture Like most of the other prominent architectural firms of the early 20th Century, GAP&W; frequently used sculpture to decorate its building designs. As was the custom of the era GAP&W; had specific artists that they preferred to work with. One in particular was New Yorker Henry Hering, who created the sculptured pediment for the Civic Opera House; a variety of details for the Field Museum of Natural History, including a variation on the Erectheum porch; and the allegorical figures Day and Night for the Great Hall of the Chicago's Union Station. As the century progressed, the firm moved away from the classical style favored by Hering and used for the firm's earlier Beaux Arts buildings to more contemporary art deco styled work, such as that attributed to sculptor Frank Jirouch on Cleveland's Midland Building.

Several early recipes also include anchovies. A variety of dressings may be used with this salad. Food historians do not agree on the history and composition of chef's salad. Some trace it to salmagundi, a popular meat and salad dish originating in 17th-century England and popular in colonial America. Others contend chef's salad is a product of the early twentieth century, originating in either New York or California. The person most often connected with the history of this salad is Louis Diat, chef of the Ritz-Carlton in New York City during the 1940s. While food historians acknowledge his recipe, they do not appear to be convinced he originated the dish, which is more popularly attributed to either chef Victor Seydoux at the Hotel Buffalo, a Statler Hotel in Buffalo, New York or to chef Jacques Roser at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. Roser worked in various culinary positions in Paris before being invited to become head chef at the prestigious 1920s Hotel Pennsylvania, where he worked for over fifteen years. Seydoux first learned his craft in Montreux, Switzerland, and continued his studies in France and England before coming to work in the United States. Seydoux's first experiences in the U.S. included positions at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and the Ritz-Carlton.Reppert, Sybil, (November 9, 1933) \\"Hungarian Goulash is Favorite Hotel Dish, Says Chef Seydoux,\\" Buffalo Times \\"The Buffalo's chef learned to cook in Montreux, Switzerland, on the Lake of Geneva. He left his native land to go to London. Then he came to America to take a position in New York's Ritz Carlton hotel. He was chef in other New York hotels and in Rochester before he came to Buffalo.\\"Statler Salesmanship (October 1926) \\"Like most of our Chefs, Mr. Seydoux learned his craft abroad, starting in his own home town of Montreux, Switzerland and finishing his training in the Palace Hotel at Vevey. After experience in some of the best hotels in France and England, he came to America as \\"Potager\\" of the Ritz-Carlton in New York City. His experience in this country included position at the Belmont, Waldorf- Astoria and McAlpin Hotels in New York...\\" Alice Rose Seydoux, widow of Victor, claims that the salad was officially launched at the Hotel Buffalo. When the customers started requesting the off-menu salad made with cuts of meat, cheese and hard boiled eggs, the hotel decided to add it to the menu. Giving chef Seydoux the honor of naming the salad he is purported to have said \\"Well, it's really a chef's salad.\\" The chef salad probably owes much of its popularity to Louis Diat, chef at the Ritz-Carlton.Evan Jones, American Food: The Gastronomic Story (1975) Cooking a la Ritz includes Diat's recipe, which includes a base of chopped lettuce topped with julienned boiled chicken, smoked ox tongue and smoked ham, then garnished with hard-cooked egg halves and watercress, all dressed with French Dressing. The inclusion of this salad on the menu at the Ritz-Carlton would have introduced the salad to more of the public. It is possible that the inclusion of Thousand Island dressing is also linked to the Ritz, since the hotel also introduced the dressing to New York City. Several other early chef salad recipes mention crumbling Roquefort cheese over the salad. The first known printed recipe dates to 1936 and includes many ingredients found in later recipes, but no meat. A 1926 recipe already includes the garlic-rubbed salad bowl. In a note following the recipe, the author recounts the following story: :While passing through a kitchen one day, I found the above mixture in huge bowl in the center of the chef's table, and being friendly to salads as well as cooks, I requested a sample and was served very liberally. The salad was delicious ; in fact it was a sort of master composition and deserving of an appropriate name. As nothing but the best of everything enters into the food materials supplied to chef's table, the salad was born and named Cooks Salad.\\" I have been more or less successful in ordering this particular salad; but if I wish to get this salmagundy right I order it from the chef‚Äôs table and not the salad pantry. The chef‚Äôs salad bowl is generally rubbed with garlic.‚Äù See also * List of salads ReferencesExternal links * History of the Salad, including Chef Salad Category:Salads Category:Meat dishes ","title":"Chef salad"},{"id":"4153713","text":"Lopo Fortunato Ferreira do Nascimento (born 10 July 1942) is an Angolan retired politician.

He was the son of Muhammad Hussain and his first wife Sughra Khanum. He was employed as a civil servant under British rule, having earlier started his career as a school teacher. Soon after partition in 1947, he migrated to Pakistan with his family.Biography of Mumtaz Mufti on urduadab4u.com website, Retrieved 4 September 2017 As a writer Mumtaz Mufti started writing Urdu short stories while working as a school teacher before 1947. In the beginning of his literary career, he was considered, by other literary critics, a non- conformist writer having liberal views, who appeared influenced by the psychologist Freud. Pakistan's famous writer Ashfaq Ahmed was one of his close friends. According to Ashfaq Ahmed, Mufti used to read unpopular literature by a Swedish writer before 1947. Mufti initially did not like the 1947 partition plan of British India, but changed his views later to become a patriotic Pakistani. In his later life, he used to defend Islam and its principles. His transformation from Liberalism to Sufism was due to his inspiration from a fellow writer Qudrat Ullah Shahab. Despite all the changes in his viewpoints, he did manage to retain his individual point of view and wrote on subjects which were frowned upon by the conservative elements in the society. The two phases of his life are witnessed by his autobiographies, Ali Pur Ka Aeeli (1961) and Alakh Nagri. According to forewords mentioned in his later autobiography, Ali Pur Ka Aeeli is an account of a lover who challenged the social taboos of his times, and Alakh Nagri is an account of a devotee who is greatly influenced by the mysticism of Qudrat Ullah Shahab.Biography of Mumtaz Mufti on goodreads.com website, Retrieved 4 September 2017 The book Talaash (\\"Quest\\") was the last book written by Mumtaz Mufti.

The explosion created fallout that affected more US residents than any other nuclear test, exposing more than 13 million people to radiation.All Around Nevada with a 360 image Within 7 months of the excavation, the bottom of the crater could be safely walked upon with no protective clothing and photographs were taken. Russian thistle, also known as tumbleweed, is the primary plant species growing in the crater along with some grasses.

Harley Quinn Crazy Train has a single 20-car train, by far the longest in the park. Each car has a single row of two seats for a total of 40 riders. It also has one of the longest stations in the park, with an individual entrance gate for every row except the first (the operator panel and computer shed are in the way). Because there is only one train, no block safety system is needed and the station also serves as the main brake run. In the early 2007 season, it was reprogrammed to complete two circuits of the track in each cycle. It makes two loops around a figure-8 track.

Founded in 2002, EACH provides support services to young people and adults affected by homophobic or transphobic bullying or harassment and training to agencies committed to realising an equal and safe working environment for all, regardless of age, sex, ability, ethnicity, faith, gender identity or sexuality. EACH co-developed the Welsh Government's statutory anti-bullying guidance for Welsh schools in partnership with Youthworks. http://www.each.education/ In November 2018, EACH was awarded Charity of the Year 2018 by the Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation http://www.standupfoundation-uk.org/2018/11/30/congratulations-to- the-2018-standup-champions/ Consultancy and training is delivered to schools, colleges, universities, statutory and voluntary sector agencies on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. EACH runs a freephone Helpline (telephone and web-based) for young people affected by homophobic or transphobic bullying nationwide.  Learn Equality - Live Equal  Commissioned by the Department for Education and the Government Equalities Office for a programme running from March 2017 to March 2019, EACH worked in partnership with the National Children's Bureau's Sex Education Forum and Anti-Bullying Alliance to challenge homophobic, biphobic and transphobic (HBT) bullying in schools. The programme delivered targeted support to over 350 schools in the East Midlands, West Midlands, South West and East of England. The programme promoted a whole school approach to effect change, aiming to equip teaching and non-teaching staff with the knowledge and skills to tackle prejudice and build inclusive school environments. Inspiring Equality in Education In March 2015, The Government Equalities Office and Department for Education awarded EACH funding from a ¬£2m package of support to promote lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) equality and challenge prejudice-based bullying in schools. EACH was one of only eight organisations selected nationally and led a consortium of local and national charities to work with West of England schools, delivering training to over 700 professionals. The programme culminated in the production of a comprehensive School Resource for KS1-4, Inspiring Equality in Education, including 17 lesson plans, policy and practice guidance and an educational film, 'What is Gender?' to help young people explore how diverse gender can be. Inspiring Equality in Education was created to help address the findings that schools often lack confidence and feel under-resourced to deal effectively with homophobic, biphobic or transphobic bullying, and draws on decades of professional practice gained from primary, secondary, rural, urban, faith and secular schools to ensure a safe and equal learning environment for all. The resource includes policy and practice guidance covering what the law says, teaching about LGBT+ identities and relationships, handling disclosures, staff training and development, improving anti-bullying policies and one-to-one support for LGBT+ young people. History In January 2015 EACH received funding from the Ben Cohen StandUp Foundation towards its Youth Volunteering Programme. The EACH Youth Volunteering Programme provided opportunities for young people across Avon and Somerset to challenge homophobic, transphobic and cyber bullying. Young people aged 13 ‚Äì 24 were encouraged to participate in a range of exciting activities and events providing opportunities to discuss prejudice-based bullying in a safe and non-judgmental environment. They could meet new people and devise youth-led awareness campaigns that promoted affirming representations of gay and transgender lives. EACH Executive Director Jonathan Charlesworth‚Äôs first book, \\"That's So Gay - Challenging Homophobic Bullying\\" was published in 2015. It is aimed at teachers and others working directly with young people, in formal or informal settings. It is a hands-on, practical guide to dealing with homophobic name-calling and bullying in primary, secondary or college settings. An updated version of the book is due to be published in 2020. In 2009 EACH was awarded a Big Lottery grant for its groundbreaking Reach project. Between 2010 and 2014 EACH worked with over 3,500 young people across the West of England: co-creating the Reach Teaching Resource: a toolkit for challenging homophobic, sexist and cyberbullying. The resource contains a DVD of films and connected activities on homophobia, sexism and cyberbullying plus guidance notes for teachers to help them understand their legal obligations and Ofsted requirements. Reach‚Äôs young people were awarded the 2013 Diana Anti-Bullying Award at a celebration conference in London in February 2014. In 2014 the Reach Teaching Resource achieved the PSHE Association's Quality Assurance 'Kite Mark'. In 2007 the now Department for Education commissioned EACH and Stonewall to create the web- based guidance to all schools - \\"Safe to Learn: Homophobic Bullying\\" which continues to be widely used and applauded by many working within education in its widest sense. EACH was subsequently invited to contribute to \\"Safe to Learn: Bullying Out of School\\" and \\"Safe to Learn: Gender-related Bullying\\" - the final guidance in the suite designed by the DCSF for schools everywhere. EACH has contributed to the Department's advice to schools on preventing and tackling bullying and consulted closely with the Church of England in its creation of guidance to church schools to help challenge homophobic school bullying.

When she was surrounded by Wehrmacht submachine gunners, she fought a heated gun battle against them, killing fifteen, wounding several more, and routing the rest, escaping wounded. For her wartime exploits, Bayda was awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1942. Early life Bayda was born in 1922 to a Russian family in the Krasnoperekopsk Raion of Crimea. After her parents died when she was young she was raised by her grandparents. In 1936, she dropped out of the school in Dzankoy without completing her studies. She worked on a state run farm, in a hospital, and then in a cooperative society in of the village of Voinka. After the house she lived in was bombed she began working at a train station to help civilians evacuate the city.  Military career  In 1941, she joined the Red Army and was assigned as a nurse in the 3rd Battalion of 514th Rifle Regiment, 172nd Rifle Division of the Red Army of the North Caucasian front; she held the rank of senior sergeant and was deployed to the front lines that same year. In addition to providing first aid she dug trenches and captured German soldiers to be interrogated. In the autumn of 1941 she was transferred to a naval infantry battalion. Due to the unit's inadequate weaponry the Germans managed to takeover a hill they had been defending, but after orders from the company commander they managed to retake control. After the regiment was later withdrawn Bayda was reassigned to the medical division of a reconnaissance unit. On 7 June 1942 she earned the nickname \\"fearless Marusia\\" after she killed 16 enemy combatants, one of whom was an officer, with her submachine gun and attacked four more German soldiers by hitting them on the head with the butt of her rifle in order to rescue her commander and eight other soldiers who were captured by the Germans. For her actions that day she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 20 June 1942. On 12 July 1942, after being severely wounded in battle, Bayda was taken prisoner and sent to Slavuta concentration camp in Ukraine and later Ravensbruck after she was held in Simferopol. She was released from captivity by the American forces on 8 May 1945.  Later life  After the war, she was discharged from military service. For many years, she headed the Sevastopol city department of civil registration, and she was repeatedly selected the deputy of city council. In 1976, she was recognized as an Honourable Citizen of Sevastopol.

Additionally, the single member of the genus Melitograis is called the white-streaked friarbird. Friarbirds are found in Australia, Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia and New Caledonia. They eat nectar, insects and other invertebrates, flowers, fruit and seeds. The friarbirds generally have drab plumage. They derive their name from the circular pattern at the crown of their heads and their neutral coloring, which makes them resemble friars. In many instances their plumage is mimicked by smaller orioles, which use the aggressive nature of the friarbirds to avoid aggression themselves. Species The genus Philemon contains the following extant species: * Meyer's friarbird (Philemon meyeri) * Brass's friarbird (Philemon brassi) * Little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis) * Grey friarbird (Philemon kisserensis) * Timor friarbird (Philemon inornatus) * Dusky friarbird (Philemon fuscicapillus) * Seram friarbird (Philemon subcorniculatus) * Black-faced friarbird (Philemon moluccensis) * Tanimbar friarbird (Philemon plumigenis) * Helmeted friarbird (Philemon buceroides) * New Guinea friarbird (Philemon novaeguineae) * New Britain friarbird (Philemon cockerelli) * New Ireland friarbird (Philemon eichhorni) * Manus friarbird (Philemon albitorques) * Silver-crowned friarbird (Philemon argenticeps) * Noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus) * New Caledonian friarbird (Philemon diemenensis) Formerly, some authorities also considered the black-eared oriole (as Philedon bouroensis) a species within the genus Philemon.

More specifically, the similarity heuristic is used to account for how people make judgments based on the similarity between current situations and other situations or prototypes of those situations. At its most basic level, the similarity heuristic is an adaptive strategy. The goal of the similarity heuristic is maximizing productivity through favorable experience while not repeating unfavorable experiences. Decisions based on how favorable or unfavorable the present seems are based on how similar the past was to the current situation. For example, a person may use the similarity heuristic when deciding on a book purchase. If a novel has a plot similar to that of novels read and enjoyed or the author has a writing style similar to that of favored authors, the purchasing decision will be positively influenced. A book with similar characteristics to previously pleasurable books is likely to also be enjoyed, causing the person to decide to obtain it. Background The similarity heuristic directly emphasizes learning from past experience. For example, the similarity heuristic has been observed indirectly in experiments such as phonological similarity tests. These tests observe how well a person can distinguish similar sounds from dissimilar ones based on a comparison to previously heard sounds. While not involving a decision making process characteristic to heuristics in general, these studies show a reliance on past experience and comparison to the current experience. In addition, the similarity heuristic has become a valuable tool in the field of economics and consumerism. Real- world examples The similarity heuristic is very easy to observe in the world of business, both from a marketing standpoint and from the position of the consumer. People tend to let past experience shape their world view; thus, if something presents itself as similar to a good experience had in the past, it is likely that the individual will partake in the current experience. The reverse holds true for situations that have proven unfavorable. A very basic example of this concept is a person deciding to get a meal at a particular restaurant because it reminds them of a similar establishment. Marketing Companies often use the similarity heuristic as a marketing strategy. For example, companies will often advertise their services as something similar to a successful competitor, but better ‚Äî such a concept is evident in the motion picture industry. Trailers for upcoming films will promote the latest movie as being made by a particular director, citing said director's past film credentials. In effect, a similarity heuristic is created in an audience's mind; creating a similarity between the coming attraction and past successes will likely make people decide to see the upcoming film. Automotive parts companies and their distributors and dealers leverage similarity heuristics when they interchange the term, \\"OEM\\" (original equipment manufacturer), and \\"OE\\" (original equipment). For example, the OE design specifications may ask for a certain durability factor, corrosion resistance, and material composition. The OEM realizes they can produce the same part less expensively and with possibly greater profit, if they do not adhere to all or most of the OE design specifications. By marketing their product as \\"OEM\\" against a well- known brand or product (e.g., Mercedes-Benz), they predict that enough customers will purchase their OEM product vs. the OE product. The converse happens when the OE factory (e.g., Mercedes-Benz) promotes their brand of a commodity product (e.g., anti-freeze/coolant, spark plugs, etc.) as superior or better quality than the commodity product. In addition, the use of a reverse similarity heuristic can be a highly valuable marketing tool. For example, when Nintendo wished to launch its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the United States, it did so in the middle of a video game depression; Atari had managed to make video games one of the least popular American pastimes. Initial showing of the NES were met poorly ‚Äî clearly, a similarity heuristic was in place, and people had created biases against anything relating to interactive television gaming. Nintendo's goal, then, became the differentiation of their system from the past examples. Employing a dissimilarity heuristic, Nintendo managed to create enough of a gap from the former video game industry and market a successful product. Problem Solving Some professions, such as software developers, regularly utilize the similarity heuristic. For software developers, the similarity heuristic is utilized when performing debugging tasks. A software bug exhibits a set of symptoms indicating the existence of a problem. In general, similar symptoms are caused by similar types of programming errors. By comparing these symptoms with those of previously corrected software flaws, a developer is able to determine the most probable cause and take an effective course of action. Over time, a developer‚Äôs past experiences will allow their use of the similarity heuristic to be highly effective, quickly choosing the debugging approach that will likely reveal the problem‚Äôs source. Problem solving in general is benefited by the similarity heuristic. When new problems arise similar to previous problems, the similarity heuristic selects an approach that previously yielded favorable results. Even if the current problem is novel, any similarity to previous issues will help choose a proper course of action.

His reign in Hungary was disputed by Charles Robert of the Angevin dynasty. Family Otto was born in Burghausen, the son of Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria, and Elizabeth of Hungary. Biography Otto succeeded his father in 1290 as duke of Lower Bavaria, together with his younger brothers, Louis III and Stephen I. He was in opposition to Habsburg and tried to regain Styria which Bavaria had lost in 1180. Otto supported Adolf, King of Germany against Habsburg and fought on his side in the Battle of G√∂llheim. The Hungarian crown was offered to Otto, a grandson of B√©la IV of Hungary, in 1301 but he did not accept before 1305. In August 1305, his opponent, Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, who had inherited Bohemia from his father, renounced his claim to Hungary on behalf of Otto III. Since the Habsburg Albert I of Germany was blocking the way through Austria, Otto disguised himself as a merchant, and reached Buda in November 1305. He was then crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r by the Bishops of Veszpr√©m and Csan√°d on 6 December. However, Otto was not able to strengthen his rule. In the course of 1306, Otto's second opponent Charles of Anjou occupied Esztergom, Szepes Castle, Z√≥lyom and some other fortresses in the northern parts of the kingdom, and in the next year he also occupied Buda. In June 1307, Duke Otto III visited the powerful Voivode of Transylvania, Ladislaus K√°n, but the latter imprisoned him. On 10 October 1307, the magnates presented at the assembly in R√°kos proclaimed Charles king, but the most powerful aristocrats (Matthew III Cs√°k, Amad√© Aba and Ladislaus K√°n) ignored him as well. At the end of the year, Ladislaus K√°n set Otto free who then left the country, but the Voivode of Transylvania still denied to hand over the Holy Crown of Hungary to Charles, whose legitimacy could be questioned without the coronation with the Holy Crown. Otto abdicated the Hungarian throne in 1308. Otto's involvement in Austrian and Hungarian affairs weakened his position in Bavaria and finally led to failure due to financial problems. In Hungarian historiography he is noted as an anti-king during the interregnum of 1301‚Äì1310. During his presence in Hungary 1305‚Äì1308 Lower Bavaria was ruled by his brother Stephen I. In 1310 a new war against Habsburg devastated Burghausen. Otto died in 1312 and was succeeded in Lower Bavaria by his son Henry XV, who shared power with his cousins, Henry XIV and Otto IV, both sons of Stephen I. John I, a son of Henry XIV, was the last duke of Lower Bavaria before Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor inherited the country and reunited the duchy in 1340. Marriages and children In January, 1279, Otto married Catherine, a daughter of Rudolf I of Germany and Gertrude of Hohenberg.Theresa Earenfight, Queenship in Medieval Europe, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), 173. Their twins, Henry and Rudolph, were born in 1280 and died the same year. Catharine died on 4 April 1282. Otto remained a widower for twenty-three years. On 18 May 1309, Otto married his second wife Agnes of Glogau. She was a daughter of Henry III, Duke of Silesia-Glogau, and Matilda of Brunswick- L√ºneburg. They had two children: *Agnes of Wittelsbach (1310‚Äì1360). *Henry XV, Duke of Bavaria (28 August 1312 ‚Äì 18 June 1333). Otto died in Landshut.

These two succinylpurines are the dephosphorylated derivatives of SAICA ribotide (SAICAR) and adenylosuccinate (S-AMP), the two substrates of adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), which catalyzes an important reaction in the de novo pathway of purine biosynthesis. ADSL catalyzes two distinct reactions in the synthesis of purine nucleotides, both of which involve the Œ≤-elimination of fumarate to produce aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) from SAICAR or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from S-AMP. Presentation Among the signs and symptoms of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency are the following: * Aggressive behavior * Microcephaly * Autism * Brachycephaly * Mild Cerebellar hypoplasia * Seizures Pathophysiology Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is responsible for a range of symptoms that involve psychomotor retardation, often accompanied by epileptic seizures, and autistic features. Two common theories were proposed to account for these effects, the first is that they result from decreased concentrations of purine nucleotides needed for purine biosynthesis. Decreased concentrations, however, could not be found in various tissues taken from ADSL-deficient people, probably because purines are furnished via the purine salvage pathway.Jaeken and Van den Berge, \\"Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency\\", The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases, Vol. 2, 8th ed., McGraw-Hill; New York, 2001. The second is the buildup of accumulating succinylpurines causes neurotoxic effects. In the severely affected individuals, the concentration levels of SAICA riboside and S-Ado are comparable, whereas in people with milder forms of the disease, the ratio of S-Ado is more than double that of those more severely affected, while SAICA riboside concentration levels remain comparable. Lysine Adenylosuccinate lyase Biochemical studies of the enzyme have focused on proteins of ADSL from nonhuman species, the ADSL structure from the crystallized protein of Thermotoga maritime has been used, along with DNA sequencing data, to construct homology models for a variety of other organisms, including human ADSL. A variety of studies have been done using the equivalent enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, which shares a significant percentage of identity along with about some percentage of similarity in amino acid sequence with the human enzyme. Homology models overlaid on each other show a high degree of overlap between the enzymes. The family of enzymes to which ADSL belongs and that catalyze Œ≤-eliminations in which fumarate is one of the products are homotetramers with four active sites composed of amino acid residues from three distinct subunits. Much is known about the active site of human ADSL due to studies of the active site in the B. subtilis ADSL through affinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis. While there is some variability among species in the sequencing of ADSL, the active site of the enzyme contains many residues that are conserved across species and have been shown to be critical to the enzyme's function. His68 and His141 seem to serve as the general acid and base catalysts, and are critical to the catalyzing reaction of the substrate. His89 seems to enhance the binding of the substrate's phosphoryl group and orient adenylosuccinate for catalysis. All three histidines are conserved throughout the 28 species for which the structure of ADSL is known. Glu275 and Lys268 have also been shown to contribute to the active site, indicating there are four active sites, each of which is formed from regions of three subunits. ADSL deficiency in different people is often caused by different mutations to the enzyme, more than 50 different mutations in the ADSL gene have been discovered Diagnosis In terms of the diagnosis of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency one should look for (or exam/method): * MRI * Demonstration of succinylpurines in extracellular fluids like plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and/or urine using high- pressure liquid chromatography, with or without mass spectroscopy * Genetic testing - genomic cDNA sequencing of the ADSL gene and characterization of mutant proteins. Treatment Treatment of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency can be done via epilepsy management with anticonvulsive drugs. Additionally the following options include: S-adenosylmethionine * D-ribose and uridine administration * Ketogenic diet * S-adenosyl-l-methionine Prognosis The prognosis of this condition in childhood usually has a stable outcome, whereas in neonatal is almost always fatal, according to Jurecka, et al.

He is known for making early recordings of radio transmissions at the start of World War I. The recordings that he made of a wireless telegraphy station owned by a German Empire-based company operating from the United States were used to expose an espionage ring. They provided evidence of clandestine messages being sent in violation of a prohibition intended to maintain United States neutrality. This proof of illicit operation led to the government seizing control of the facility to stop the activity. Apgar's efforts received extensive coverage in newspapers and technical science magazines at the time. His contributions were praised by government investigators. Publications continued to remark on his work many years later.  Biography  Apgar was born in Gladstone, New Jersey on June 28, 1865. He was a student at Centenary Collegiate Institute in 1880. He attended Wesleyen University in 1887-88 though he never graduated. He then married Helen May Clarke and they had three children: Charles Emory Apgar Jr., who died at a young age; Lawrence C. Apgar, who became a professor of music; and Dr. Virginia Apgar, who was a pioneer in obstetrics and neonatology. They owned a suburban home in residential Westfield, New Jersey, from New York City. Apgar was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Westfield. He became a Master Mason at a Freemasonry lodge in 1906. He worked as a business executive in a variety of positions for New York Life Insurance Company and later for the brokerage firm Spencer Trask & Co. In 1915, during the time when his recordings gained notoriety, he was employed as a salesman for Haynes Automobile Company. He was also an amateur astronomer whose calculations of the motions of Jupiter's satellites were regularly published in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. He died in Westfield at the age of 85.  Amateur radio  The station at his home including equipment that he built Apgar became interested in wireless telegraphy after reading about an amateur who had heard election returns transmitted by a newspaper on election night (i.e. before the results could be widely distributed the following morning.) He built his first \\"home-made\\" wireless telegraphy equipment on December 11, 1910 ‚Äì one month after the election. He listened to news bulletins from the New York Herald station OHX in Manhattan. The station had been created to send news to approaching ocean liners and receive reports about their voyage. After the passage of the Radio Act of 1912, he was licensed to use the call sign 2MM from 1913 to 1915. At the experimental wireless station inside his home in Westfield he operated a 450watt amateur station. The equipment he constructed could use a wavelength of during an era when few amateurs went beyond . It was described as a \\"high-grade plant\\" of \\"extraordinary efficiency.\\" In April 1913 he became an associate member of the recently founded Institute of Radio Engineers. He was an early participant in the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) by October 1913. He soon began publishing descriptions of wireless equipment that he had designed in technical magazines. Circuit diagram of his station connected to a phonograph recorder. He built equipment that could greatly amplify the sound from his radio receiver. Connected to a device that he called a \\"loud talker-horn\\" (an early type of loudspeaker) it could be heard away. An editor of a magazine was so impressed that he enthusiastically described it as \\"One of the greatest feats ever produced by any amateur...\\" Apgar also devised a method to record the signals from stations that he listened to. His accounts of the equipment he used to make the recordings were featured in magazines such as The Wireless Age and Electrical Experimenter. His recordings were colloquially referred to as \\"canned messages.\\"  Wireless recordings  Apgar's equipment was mostly homemade with the exception of the headphones and of an improved Audion designed by Edwin Howard Armstrong that was part of the circuit used to detect and amplify the signal. It was connected to a Dictaphone which allowed him to record Morse code transmissions on wax cylinders made by Edison Manufacturing Company. His first recording was made October 12, 1913, of the New York Herald station, which by this time was using the call sign WHB. By October 1914, he had recorded other transmissions including the United States Navy station NAA sending time signals.  Sayville station  Painting on the cover of the August 1915 issue of The Electrical Experimenter titled Sayville (N. Y.) Wireless Receiving German War Report. Apgar then became interested in wireless station WSL in Sayville, New York, on the coast of Long Island. In the evenings, he spent time tuning his radio to the messages sent by Sayville to other stations, a practice known as \\"listening in.\\" It was a high power commercial station designed for long distance communication. The station was operated by the Atlantic Communications Company which was primarily owned by the German company Telefunken. The station was built to establish two-way communication with the Nauen Transmitter Station POZ in Europe which was jointly owned by the Imperial German Army and Imperial Mail. Nauen was the only station in Europe capable of transmitting to North America at the time. It was mostly sending news that Sayville received and distributed by landline telegraph to American wire services. During construction in August 1912, the US Navy began observing Sayville because it was reportedly controlled by a company that was under the influence of the government of the German Empire. The company claimed that it had no such connection. It had become operational in July 1913. These were the first regular transmissions between the United States and Germany. The equipment that Apgar built was sensitive enough that he also often clearly heard the Nauen station that was distant. Apgar listened to Sayville and made his first recordings of it in November 1913. In February 1914, Apgar sent some of these cylinder recordings to the operators of Sayville, at their request. At the start of World War I, the United States declared that it was neutral in the conflict. In August 1914, President Woodrow Wilson issued an executive order that prohibited radio communication of an \\"unneutral nature\\" from United States territory. Any communication that could aid military activities would have jeopardized neutrality. This was due to an article in the Hague Convention that stated: \\"belligerents are forbidden to erect on the territory of a neutral power a wireless telegraphy station or other apparatus for the purpose of communicating with belligerent forces on land or sea.\\" The US Navy stationed personnel at the facility to inspect the messages before they were sent and enforce the order if needed. Sayville was considered one of the three most important stations to which this order applied. Sayville wireless station and umbrella antenna, 1915. During the war the German transatlantic telegraph cable was intentionally cut by the British which resulted in the German embassy becoming heavily reliant on the new wireless station. The summer residence of German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff in Cedarhurst, New York, on Long Island had a direct telegraph line to Sayville to relay diplomatic communication to Germany by wireless. The US Navy began to have doubts about the legitimate operation of the station after they learned that a technical advisor there, physicist and engineer Jonathan Zenneck, was a captain in the German marines. The station was soon suspected of violating the presidential prohibition by including secret messages despite the government censorship. During the summer months, reception of wireless signals was difficult due to adverse atmospheric conditions that increased static. Long distance communication was possible only during the night for brief intervals. To alleviate this limitation Sayville \\"quietly\\" (such that only a few government officials were aware of it) made major improvements to its equipment. In April 1915, the transmitter was upgraded from 35 to 100 kilowatts and three tall antenna towers were installed, transforming it into one of the most powerful transatlantic stations in this part of the world. By May the Telefunken station at Sayville and another at Tuckerton, New Jersey, were accused of sending messages to a German U-boat providing information that allowed the submarine to \\"ambush\\" and sink the RMS Lusitania. This led to greater scrutiny of activity at the station.  Investigation  Apgar producing \\"canned\\" wireless messages on his recorder, 1915 Apgar noticed the peculiar messages sent from Sayville. He informed an inspector from the Department of Commerce Radio Bureau about the odd messages and his recordings of them. Apgar knew L. R. Krumm, Chief Radio Inspector for the Port of New York and New Jersey, and the inspector had been aware of his recordings for some time. Krumm visited Apgar to examine his apparatus and witness a demonstration. Krumm then alerted the United States Secret Service and suggested that they contact Apgar. At the request of William J. Flynn, Chief of the Secret Service, Apgar commenced making regular recordings of the station on June 7, 1915. This continued every night for two weeks. He alternated between two cylinder recorders to ensure uninterrupted capturing of the messages while he replaced a full cylinder with a new blank one. During this time he made 11 hours of permanent recordings that captured 25,000 words transmitted by the station. Apgar was paid for this work by the government through Flynn. The \\"perforator apparatus\\" used at Sayville to punch Morse code on paper tape. The original messages, approved by government censors, were suspected to contain subsequently altered Morse code that could be used as a cipher. The Sayville station was equipped with a type of Wheatstone system that used perforated paper tape to automatically key the transmitter. An operator produced the tape containing the message before sending. The tape was then run through the transmitter control equipment at a high speed. It operated at 150 wpm (words per minute), significantly faster than the 50 wpm that a highly skilled operator could send manually. The transmissions were so rapid that it made the messages unintelligible to a listener. It was a \\"meaningless, musical hum or buzz which puzzled all hearers\\" and sounded like a \\"titanic bumblebee.\\" Apgar transcribed the previous night's recording each morning by playing the wax cylinder on a phonograph at a much slower speed. He would then telephone the Secret Service to file a report about the transmissions. He made 175 recordings of these suspicious messages, each cylinder containing 4 minutes of transmission time. In addition to his daily reports he turned over the original cylinder recordings to government investigators. The messages from Sayville were then discussed by the Cabinet of the United States. The recordings proved that the suspected covert messages were present within the approved transmissions. Apgar's \\"canned\\" messages are credited with establishing the truth about the Sayville station's activity, though the exact nature of the messages on the recordings remained an official secret. This evidence led to Wilson ordering the US Navy to seize the facility on July 8, 1915. The seizure caused consternation among officers in the Imperial German Navy. The US Navy operated the station in trust to send commercial messages for the duration of the war.  Encoded messages  \\"The above 'code' diagram shows how secret cipher messages could be interspersed through regular messages.\\" In example \\"No 2\\" the Morse code for the letter \\"B\\" has been changed to \\"6E\\" by adding two extra dots. After listening to the recordings it took the Secret Service four months to decode the hidden messages. A covert message interspersed with the censor approved text might include the addition of \\"5-8-K-14-B\\" for example. This would direct the recipient to the fifth and eighth words on page 11, and the fourteenth word on page 2, of a rare edition of a German dictionary. A variety of alternate methods of encoding were used. For long distance communication in this era it was standard practice to employ repetition to ensure successful reception. The message \\"Pr 3.\\" would be sent \\"Pr 3. Pr 3.\\" for example. The Sayville transmissions varied this practice by sometimes sending \\"Pr Pr 3 Pr. 3.\\" ‚Äì a significant variation that a casual listener might overlook. These were alleged to be a key to an acrostic code. Other methods of obfuscation included using innocuous English or American sounding fictitious names such as \\"Frederick Chappell\\" to refer to the German submarine Deutschland or \\"Theodore Hooper\\" as a code name to refer to Capt. von Papen, the German military attach√© in Washington, DC. The phrase \\"Expect father to-morrow\\" would be interpreted as \\"The political situation between America and Germany grows worse. It is imperative that you take care of your New York affairs.\\" These names and phrases were concealed in communications that masqueraded as commercial messages. Copies of these were provided to the government by the Providence Journal which accused the German Embassy of revealing secret information about the movements of the allied navy fleet. The headline of the story was subtitled: \\"Ambassador Breaks Pledges and with Captain Boy-Ed Has Tricked United States Authorities for Months.\\"  Significance and legacy  Cover story about Apgar in The Wireless Age, September 1915 Hiram Percy Maxim has noted that he and other amateurs also noticed these messages: \\"Apgar, the old sleuth, smelled something just about the time the rest of us did.\\" Flynn describes the importance of Apgar's contributions to the government seizure: \\"It was really his absolutely faithful records of all of the signals sent out from Sayville that caused the United States to seize the famous station.\\" Extensive coverage in the media in 1915 included a magazine cover story about Apgar that referred to him as \\"A Wireless Detective in Real Life.\\" A photo of Apgar published in Popular Radio, November 1923 A 1923 article by William J. Burns, then director of the Bureau of Investigation, in Popular Radio included a photo of Apgar. It was captioned \\"The Radio Detective Who Unfathomed the Famous 'Nauen Buzz'\\" and the description read: > During the early days of the World War the incredibly rapid and > undecipherable radio signals between the most powerful broadcasting station > in Germany and the station of the \\"Telefunken Company\\" at Sayville, Long > Island, N. Y., aroused the attention of the U. S. officials. But it was > radio amateur, Charles E. Apgar of Westfield, N. J., who finally found the > solution by means of amplifiers that recorded these signals on wax > phonograph cylinders. By this means the messages were de-coded ‚Äì and the > Long Island station was promptly seized. This picture shows Mr. Apgar > operating the same apparatus which he used on that historic occasion. The Sayville incident has been described as one of the first \\"overt acts\\" that led to American entry into World War I two years later. The specific information recorded on the wax cylinders remained a closely guarded secret in the government archives for many years. The cylinders that he recorded were acquired by NBC in 1934. An example was displayed, along with the original receiving set that Apgar donated, as part of a museum exhibit in the lobby of Rockefeller Center. Apgar's work received renewed attention early during World War II when amateur radio operators began listening for \\"fifth column\\" activity such as odd coded messages sent from \\"mystery\\" stations. His work was noted by the ARRL in 2015 during a commemoration held on the 100th anniversary of the sinking of Lusitania. At this time he was also inducted into the CQ Amateur Radio Hall of Fame. Some of Apgar's homemade equipment has been preserved at The Henry Ford museum. His original wax cylinders are believed to be lost, but some samples of his recordings survive. An interview of Apgar by George Hicks was broadcast on station WJZ and the NBC Blue Network on Dec. 27, 1934. A tape copy of the original aluminum phonograph discs and a transcript is in the Recorded Sound Collection of the Library of Congress. A recording of this broadcast donated by Thorn Mayes is in the collection of the Antique Wireless Association. Broadcast historian Elizabeth McLeod considers Apgar's cylinders to be the earliest surviving recordings of a radio transmission based on research done by Dr. Michael Biel. Apgar has been referred to as a \\"pioneer home-recorder.\\" He has also been credited with making the first permanent record of a wireless message.  Fictional portrayal  Advertisement for The Eagle's Eye serial After Flynn's retirement from the Secret Service, his experiences were adapted by Courtney Ryley Cooper into a 20-part spy thriller. These were published as weekly installments in The Atlanta Constitution's magazine section during 1918. The title of the series was The Eagle's Eye: A True Story of the Imperial German Government's Spies and Intrigues in America. An episode titled \\"The Great Hindu Conspiracy\\" begins with a minor character named Charles E. Apgar. He is described as a \\"wireless expert\\" who is recruited to record messages from Sayville. The fictional Apgar is said to be \\"quite a linguist.\\" The letter combinations hidden in the messages remind the character of Hindi. This observation is an important clue in the espionage investigation featured in the storyline. The episodes were also released as a serial film titled The Eagle's Eye. Fifteen of the episodes were republished as chapters in a book the following year, though the story with Apgar was not included.

Created by Grant Baciocco and Doug Price, it is a family friendly show in the style of old-time radio. The show also draws much inspiration from The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show. The show first began in April 2004 on Dementia Radio but gained its popularity via podcasting. The show originates from Hood Avenue Studios in Burbank, California. Plot= Seasons 1‚Äì6 (and live episodes)  When his Time and Space Travel Device is stolen by the evil mastermind Dr. Steve and his sock-shaped assistant Fidgert. Dr. Floyd, his young prot√©g√© Dr. Grant and their faithful robot companion C.H.I.P.S. must do what they can to get it back. Bent on achieving fame and fortune, Dr. Steve plans to race through history, stealing historical items and then returning to the future to sell them on eBay. Can Dr. Floyd and his crew thwart the evil machinations of Dr. Steve and Fidgert? In almost every episode the cast visits a famous historical figure. At the end of Season 6, Dr. Grant passed his \\"Prot√©g√© 101\\" test (with a score of 98%) and thus tested out of prot√©g√© classification (and therefore must leave Dr. Floyd); C.H.I.P.S.' parents are in dire trouble and C.H.I.P.S must help them without Dr. Floyd's help (because bringing humans to C.H.I.P.S.' planet is forbidden and would get C.H.I.P.S. into big trouble); and Dr. Steve returns the Time and Space Travel Device to Dr. Floyd (because Dr. Floyd has stopped him every time he has used it for personal gain.)  Season 7  At the start of Season 7, Dr. Steve (and later Dr. Floyd) go down to the Saddle River City Library to do some book browsing. The Librarian asks if there is some Doctor Convention in town, mainly because there have been so many doctors coming to the library. Dr. Floyd heads to the classical literature section placed in the basement of the Library. He finds Dr. Steve trying to find a book on 'the life and times of Berry Malaho'. Dr. Floyd then gives Dr. Steve a lesson on the Dewey Decimal System and then says he's in the wrong area as the classical literature is in the 800's. As Dr. Floyd shows him to the right section of the Library, they are stopped by three Doctors in different coats who are named collectively 'The Literati'. Their goal is to 'bring about the total destruction and complete annihalation of Dr. Floyd!' The Literati invented the Translitora which \\"looks somewhat like a laser cannon\\", but was built to destroy Dr. Floyd. Dr. Steve however says that there can only be one person against Dr. Floyd- himself. Dr. Steve pushes the button on the Translitora, its effect grabbing both Dr. Floyd and Dr. Steve. In a flash Dr. Floyd and Dr. Steve both vanish. The Literati are thrilled that they have now gotten rid of Dr. Floyd. However, Dr. Floyd finds that he and Dr. Steve are now stuck in the stories of Classic literature with the remote control. In every episode in Season 7, the cast visits a famous classical novel/book. The final two episodes of Season 7 try to wrap up this Season by sending Dr. Grant and CHIPS back to Dr. Floyd's Lab, (with mini episodes only found on by members of the show, e.g. The Imagination Nations Rangers/Members and eventually getting Dr. Steve and Dr. Floyd out of Classical Literature. Eventually Fidgert steals the Time and Space Travel Device and Dr. Floyd, Dr. Grant and CHIPS are again trying to chase Dr. Steve and Fidgert.  History  The first episode was aired on Dementia Radio on April 4, 2004 and began podcasting on November 7, 2004. Each episode is approximately 7 minutes long, though some are longer and some are shorter. The shows have featured guest stars from around the entertainment world playing historical figures. June Foray, Jeffrey Tambor, Don Novello, Frank Conniff, Rick Overton, Kira Soltanovich and Ron Lynch are among the celebrities who have played parts on the show. The show was nominated for Best Comedy Podcast in the first ever Podcast Awards. In September 2010, the creators announced on their website that Season 8 (their current season) would be their final season and that after the final episode is aired, they will be releasing all their episodes online for free to download.

Following his attempt at an A-League career, √ñzbey returned to the NSW Premier League in 2008 with the Marconi Stallions. After a disappointing year with the Stallions, he signed with Sydney Olympic FC for the 2008 season. √ñzbey had previously played at Sydney Olympic FC during his youth career.

It lies within Ashburnham and Ashby, in Massachusetts, and New Ipswich, in New Hampshire; the Wapack Trail and the Midstate Trail both cross the mountain. The Yellow Arrow trail is 1.1 mile. Public parking for a half-hour (one way) hike to the summit is located on Massachusetts Route 119. The name is probably a corruption of the Native American term Wetu-tick, \\"wigwam brook,\\" and probably applied first to the nearby large stream and thereafter to the mountain and the pond. The east and south side of the mountain drains into the Souhegan River watershed, to the Merrimack River thence the Atlantic Ocean; the west and north sides drain into the Millers River watershed, to the Connecticut River, thence into Long Island Sound. Mount Watatic was the site of a ski area that operated from 1965 until 1984. An attempt to reopen the ski area in 1988 failed. The bald summit of the mountain featured a fire tower, open to the public, until its removal in 1996. Conservation An engraved stone at the summit of Mount Watatic. In 2000, the summit of the mountain was sold to Industrial Communications and Electronics for the development of a cellular telephone tower and a road to the summit. In 2002, prior to development of the communications tower, the mountain was purchased for $2,500,000 by the Ashby Land Trust, the Town of Ashby, the Ashburnham Conservation Trust, the Town of Ashburnham, Mass Dept of Fish and Wildlife and Mass Dept of Conservation and Recreation. Unfortunately by this point a road had already been blasted into the ski area (back) side of the mountain, making several of the still maintained ski trails unusable. The purchase resulted in the permanent protection of approximately of the mountain, including the summit, as conservation land. In July 2010, Mount Watatic was named one of the \\"1000 Great Places in Massachusetts\\" by the State Commission of Massachusetts. References * Southern New Hampshire Trail Guide (1999).

Together with the Terra series of the rival publisher Arthur Moewig Verlag, Munich, the Utopia series were the most important science fiction work in the early years of West Germany.  Utopia Zukunftsromane  Utopia Zukunftsromane (future novels) was a dime novel series which was produced between 1953 and 1968 and reached 596 volumes. To distinguish Zukunftsromane from Gro√üband (\\"big issue\\", see below) they also were unofficially called \\"Kleinband\\" (\\"little issue\\").  Subseries (selection) and spin-off  All of the first 43 issues of Zukunftsromane belonged to the subseries Jim Parkers Abenteuer im Weltraum (adventures in space) written by Alf Tj√∂rnsen and other authors. Sixteen more Parkers novels were printed within Zukunftsromane #48 to #129. Apparently caused by the success of Moewigs series Perry Rhodan 1962 a new subseries started within Zukunftsroman #320 to #352: Mark Powers - Der Held des Weltalls (hero of space, Freder van Holk and others). In the end of 1962 Mark Powers became a separate series with 48 volumes. After the separate series was finalised some more Powers novels were printed within Zukunftsromane starting with #404. Within Zukunftsromane #550 to #590 the subseries ad astra was published (21 volumes, 1967/68, H. G. Francis and others).  Utopia Gro√üband / Kriminal  1954 Pabel started a new series: Utopia Gro√üband (\\"big issue\\") Whereas a volume of Zukunftsromane normally had 64 pages a volume of Gro√üband typically had 96 pages. Gro√üband was finished 1963 with volume #204. Already with #197 Gro√üband was renamed to \\"Sonderband\\" (\\"special issue\\") - the same name Utopia Magazin (see below) started what causes confusion until today. The volumes #26/28/30/32 of Gro√üband were subtitled \\"Kriminalroman aus der der Welt von morgen\\" (\\"detective story from the world of tomorrow\\"). Subsequently Pabel started a separate series with amazing detective stories: Utopia Kriminal (1956-58, 27 volumes).  Utopia Magazin  1955 Pabel issued \\"Utopia Sonderband\\", a magazine with short stories and science fiction related articles. With volume #3 Sonderband was renamed to \\"Utopia SF Magazin\\", with volume #10 it was renamed to Utopia Magazin. Utopia Magazin was finished 1959 with volume #26. Editors of Utopia Magazin (and temporarily of the other Pabels series) were Walter Ernsting and Walter Spiegl.  VPM reprints  End of the 1970s merged Pabel-Moewig Verlag (VPM), Rastatt started 3 paperbook series of reprints: * Utopia Bestseller, 44 novels by K. H. Scheer (1978-82) * Utopia Bestseller aus Zeit und Raum 39 novels by Wolf Detlef Rohr (1979-82) * Utopia Classics 87 novels by German and international authors (1979-86)  Other publishers  Between 1957 and 1960 57 issues of the pulp series Luna were published by Walter Lehning Verlag, Hanover. Originally the full name was Luna Utopia- Roman, with issue 29 the name was changed to Luna Weltraum (utopischer Roman). There was also a series by this publisher originally called UTR Luna Utopia Taschen Roman (10 paperbacks / 3 dime novel formats, 1957-59). In the 1980s the East German publishing house Das Neue Berlin, Berlin produced the paperbacks SF-Utopia.

Known for most of its length as Telegraph Road, the highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Harrisville east to the Delaware state line near Appleton, where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 273 (DE 273). MD 273 is the main east-west highway of northern Cecil County, connecting Conowingo (via US 1), Port Deposit (via MD 276), and Rising Sun with Newark, Delaware, via the communities of Calvert and Fair Hill, where the highway intersects MD 272 and MD 213, respectively. The state highway also provides access to the Fair Hill Training Center. MD 273 west of Fair Hill was constructed as one of the original state roads starting in the early 1910s. MD 273 west of and through Rising Sun was the original course of US 1, which was paved from the Susquehanna River to northeast of Rising Sun in the 1910s. The state highway east of Rising Sun was paved in several sections between the mid-1910s and the late 1920s. The portion of original US 1 west of Octoraro Creek comprised a western segment of MD 273 from the late 1920s to the late 1950s. The section of US 1 that followed present-day MD 273 was reconstructed in the early to mid-1950s, shortly before MD 273 was extended west to its present western terminus when US 1 was placed on the Rising Sun Bypass in the late 1950s. The highway was reconstructed from east of Rising Sun to the Delaware state line in several stages from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Route description View west along MD 273 at MD 213 in Fair Hill MD 273 begins west of Harrisville at a perpendicular intersection with US 1, which heads south as Conowingo Road and north as the Rising Sun Bypass. The state highway heads south then immediately turns east onto Rising Sun Road. Rising Sun Road to the west of the intersection is officially MD 273A; that auxiliary highway is signed as MD 273 eastbound from US 1, and is closed to through traffic westbound. MD 273 heads east as a two-lane undivided road through the hamlet of Harrisville, where the highway passes the Nathan and Susannah Harris House, before meeting MD 276 (Jacob Tome Memorial Highway) at a roundabout. The state highway enters the town of Rising Sun, where its name changes to Main Street and the highway intersects the western end of MD 274 (Queen Street). After leaving the town limits, MD 273 becomes Telegraph Road and intersects Half Mile Turn and Sylmar Road; Half Mile Turn is a one-lane ramp from Sylmar Road to MD 273. The state highway passes the Jeremiah Brown House and Mill Site and the Plumpton Park Zoo before crossing North East Creek. MD 273 continues east through farmland to the community of Calvert, where the highway intersects MD 272, which heads south as North East Road and north as Chrome Road. Brick Meetinghouse Road partially parallels the present course to the south, providing access to the East Nottingham Friends Meetinghouse and the Elisha Kirk House. MD 273 crosses Little North East Creek, intersects Blue Ball Road at a roundabout in Blue Ball Village, and meets Little Elk Creek Road, which leads to Little Elk Farm and the historic home Hopewell. The state highway crosses Little Elk Creek just west of Rock United Presbyterian Church as the highway reaches Fair Hill, where Fair Hill Drive parallels MD 273 to the south before the intersection with MD 213, which heads south as Singerly Road and north as Lewisville Road. Beyond MD 213, MD 273 passes through Fair Hill Natural Resources Management Area, a state park most well known for the Fair Hill Training Center, an equestrian training facility, and also the site of the Fair Hill Fairgrounds that hosts the Cecil County Fair. The state highway passes under three service bridges within the park and parallels an abandoned alignment as it crosses Big Elk Creek. MD 273 leaves the state park just west of a roundabout with Appleton Road in Appleton. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, where it continues east as DE 273 (Nottingham Road) into the city of Newark. History thumbrightMD 273 westbound past its eastern terminus at DE 273 at the Delaware border near Appleton The portion of MD 273 west of Fair Hill was included in the planned state road system by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The planned state road continued west from MD 273's present terminus near Harrisville along the present and old alignments of US 1 to the Conowingo Bridge over the Susquehanna River. The portions of the state road between Oakwood and Octoraro Creek and from the east town limit of Rising Sun to between Sylmar Road and North East Creek were paved as macadam road in 1910 and 1911. The highway between Oakwood and the Conowingo Bridge was completed as a concrete road in 1914. The road from east of Sylmar Road to east of Calvert was under construction by 1915 and completed by 1919. Part of the gap between Octoraro Creek at Porters Bridge and Rising Sun was filled with construction of a concrete road in two stages, the first completed by 1919 and the second completed by 1921. The road from Appleton to the Delaware state line was completed as a concrete road in 1921 and 1922, and the highway from east of Calvert to east of Blue Ball was completed in 1923. The gap between Blue Ball and Fair Hill was completed by 1927, the same year US 1 was marked from the Conowingo Bridge through Rising Sun to Sylmar. The final piece of MD 273 to be paved was from Fair Hill to Appleton, which was built as a concrete road in 1929 and 1930. US 1 bypassed the portion of the state road west of Octoraro Creek when the highway's modern route crossing the Susquehanna River at Conowingo Dam was completed in 1928. The old highway west of Octoraro Creek-- which followed Old Conowingo Road, Ragan Road, and Connelly Road--became a western section of MD 273. This section was transferred from state to county maintenance in a road transfer agreement on May 8, 1958. The main section of MD 273 was extended west slightly when US 1 was relocated onto the Half Mile Turn to eliminate the right-angle turn at the intersection of Telegraph Road and Sylmar Road in 1935. US 1 was reconstructed through Cecil County in the early to mid-1950s, including the Harrisville-Sylmar portion of what is now MD 273. The U.S. Highway was reconstructed and widened from Conowingo through Harrisville to Rising Sun in 1952 and 1953. The highway from Rising Sun to Sylmar was reconstructed and widened in 1954 and 1955. MD 273 was extended west through Rising Sun and Harrisville to its present western terminus when US 1's Rising Sun Bypass opened in 1957. The first section of MD 273 east of Sylmar to be reconstructed was through Calvert, bypassing Brick Meetinghouse Road, which became MD 809. This section was built in conjunction with the relocation of MD 272 at Calvert between 1956 and 1958. The highway from east of Fair Hill to the Delaware state line was reconstructed between 1963 and 1965. As part of this work, the highway was relocated and a new bridge was built at Big Elk Creek; part of the old highway on the east side of the creek was transferred from the state to Fair Hill Training Center through an agreement on July 16, 1970. MD 273 was reconstructed from Sylmar Road to west of Calvert between 1969 and 1971. The highway from west of Little Elk Creek to east of Fair Hill was reconstructed and relocated between 1971 and 1973. The new highway bypassed Fair Hill Drive, which was transferred to the county after the new highway was completed and the old highway was resurfaced according to an October 8, 1969, road transfer agreement. The final portion of MD 273 to be reconstructed, from east of Calvert to west of Little Elk Creek, was started in 1972 and completed in 1973. MD 273's western terminus was moved to a perpendicular intersection with US 1 in 2001. The highway's roundabout with MD 276 in Harrisville was built in 2002 and 2003, the same years Main Street through Rising Sun underwent a streetscape project. In September 2016, construction began on $2.1 million project to build a roundabout at Appleton Road in Appleton; the roundabout opened to traffic in 2017. A roundabout is being constructed at the intersection with Blue Ball Road near Fair Hill. Construction of the $2.5 million project was originally supposed to begin in March 2016 and be finished in December of that year but was delayed by utility relocations and design errors. Construction of the roundabout at Blue Ball Road began by July 2017 but was then stalled by the original contractor. In 2019, a new contractor was brought in to finish the project, with construction completed in 2020. Junction listAuxiliary route MD 273A is the designation for the section of Rising Sun Road from a one-lane ramp from northbound US 1 to its intersection with MD 273. The route starts as a one- lane ramp before it turns into a two-lane undivided road. MD 273A was designated in 2001 when MD 273's western terminus was relocated to a perpendicular intersection with US 1.

() is the youngest of Poland's 23 National Parks. It was created on June 19, 2001, in the region of the lowest stretch of the Warta river, up to its confluence with the Odra (Oder), which marks the Polish-German border. The Park covers an area of within Lubusz Voivodeship. The name Uj≈õcie Warty means \\"mouth of the Warta\\" ‚Äì the Polish word uj≈õcie also being used for the termination of a river at another river or lake rather than the sea. The Park was created on the area of the former S≈Ço≈Ñsk Nature Reserve, which had existed since 1977, and parts of the Uj≈õcie Warty Landscape Park. The ground here is swampy and muddy, which makes it a haven for birds. This is why the former S≈Ço≈Ñsk preserve, which is now part of the Park, was in 1984 covered by the Ramsar Convention, whose purpose is to protect such areas. The Park has its headquarters in the village of Chyrzyno, near Kostrzyn nad OdrƒÖ. Waters The Park‚Äôs main river is the Warta, which divides it into two parts - Southern (including the former S≈Ço≈Ñsk reserve) and Northern - the so-called Northern Polder. In the South, yearly changes in level of water reach up to 4 meters and the Park here serves as a gigantic, seasonal lake for excessive waters. Water level here raises usually late in the fall, but it is the highest in the spring (March‚ÄìApril). The Northern part is rich in various canals and it is separated from the Warta by a levee. Wildlife Great egret in Uj≈õcie Warty National Park Bird sanctuary with an access road Plant life is highly heterogeneous in biological sense. It is to large extent natural, although hundreds of years of human activity have influenced it, especially in the forested areas. On the other hand, nature in swampy areas closer to the Warta, is mainly untouched and as such is an interesting object of studies for biologists from Poland and other European countries. This is because most major river valleys in Europe have been changed by humans. The area of the Park is one of the most important regions of birds‚Äô lairs in Poland. There are 245 species of birds here and lairs of 160, including 7-8 species of ducks. 26 species are endangered (according to the BirdLife International list). Among them are: Acrocephalus paludicola, Crex crex, Limosa limosa, Grus grus, Botaurus stellaris, Ixobrychus minutus or quite common here Chlidonias niger. Moreover, in the Park there are 34 species of mammals, including otters (Lutra lutra) and beavers (Castor fibre). The main threat to Park‚Äôs ecosystem is the return of bigger plants to the delicate systems of meadows and pastures. Their regrowth endangers lairs of birds, so Park‚Äôs authorities have taken necessary steps to fight this phenomenon. Since May 31, 1996 there has been Centre of Natural Education at Chyrzno, which since fall of that year has been organizing courses for pupils and students. Among activities undertaken by the Centee there are: trips to the Park, ornithology camps, ecology workshops. In Park there are some walking and cycling trails and two nature walks Ptasim szlakiem (‚ÄúAlong birds‚Äô trail‚Äù), which crosses through the most valuable parts of the S≈Ço≈Ñsk reserve. The Park's Board owns a small lodge with 5 overnight rooms for 15 persons and a guest-house for about 30 visitors.

Plot The story revolves around two kittens, \\"Hush\\" and \\"Brush,\\" who attempt to create green paint through mixing their other paints. Their attempts lead to a variety of different hues‚Äînone of them green. The book's famous catch phrase is \\"Blue is blue, and red is red! They still need green!\\" Publication history *The Color Kittens, 1949, USA, Simon and Schuster *The Colour Kittens, 1973, Australia, Golden Press *The Color Kittens, (Kathi Ember, illustrator) 1994, USA, Western Publishing *The Color Kittens, 2003, USA, Random House Reception Children's book author and illustrator Paul O. Zelinsky, for whom the book was a childhood favorite and inspiration, said that, \\"In a way, the book was written to teach facts about color, but its real subject is the huge pleasure to be found in the seeing and feeling of color [...]\\". Suzanne Rahn notes that Hush and Brush's active creativity and exploration have some parallels among Brown's other cat characters, such as the drastically less-humanized Pussycat, who are much more passive in their representation of the creative state Brown called ‚ÄúCat Life‚Äù.

The first B-52 wings were also extremely large - composed of 45 bombers and 15 or 20 KC-135s, all situated on one base. As the Soviet missile threat became more pronounced and warning time became less, SAC bases presented increasingly attractive targets. It was necessary to break up these large concentrations of aircraft and scatter them throughout more bases. Several KC-97 squadrons were separated from their parent B-47 wings and relocated to northern bases. The B-47 dispersal program was a long range one and would be affected primarily through the phase out of wings in the late fifties and early sixties. With the B-52 force, which was still growing, dispersal became an active program in 1958. Basically the B-52 dispersal program called for larger B-52 wings already in existence to be broken up into three equal-sized wings of 15 aircraft each, with two of them being relocated, normally to bases of other commands. In essence, each dispersed B-52 squadron became a strategic wing. This principle would also be followed in organizing and equipping the remained of the B-52 force. Headquarters USAF established the entire force at 42 squadrons in 1958. Ideally, each B-52 wing would have an air refueling squadron of 10 or 15 aircraft. By the end of 1958, SAC had activated 14 strategic wings, but only three had aircraft assigned. The others were in various stages of development, with some having only a headquarters and one officer and one airman authorized.‚Äù.Office of the Historian, Headquarters Strategic Air Command, Offutt AFB, NE. The Development of the Strategic Air Command 1946-1986, Pages 72-73 Redesignation to AFCON status When the B-52 dispersal began in the fifties, the new units created to support this program were named strategic wings and given four-digit designations, for example, the 4137th Strategic Wing. Under the USAF organization and lineage system, these four-digit units fell into the MAJCOM (major air command controlled) category and their lineage (histories, awards, and battle honors) ended with their discontinuance and could never be revived. In sharp contrast, AFCON (Headquarters USAF controlled) units, which were readily distinguished by having one, two or three digit designations, could go through a series of inactivations and activations and still retain their lineage. Headquarters SAC was well aware of the historical significance of records and accomplishments of the strategic wings and the need to perpetuate this lineage as well as the lineage of many illustrious unit that were no longer active. In order to retain the lineage of the combat units and to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activated AFCON units, most of which were inactive at the time. The reorganization process, which extended from 1 January through 1 September, was applied to 22 B-52 strategic wings, three air-refueling wings, and the 4321st Strategic Wing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. These units were discontinued and two and three-digit AFCON units were activated. In most cases, the bombardment squadron that had been assigned to the strategic wings were inactivated and bombardment squadrons that had previously been assigned to the newly activated wings were activated. While these actions were almost tantamount to redesignation, they were not official redesignation. Therefore, the records, awards and achievements of the strategic wing could not be inherited by the bomb wings.‚Äù Office of the Historian, Headquarters Strategic Air Command, Offutt AFB, NE.

The object of the game is to move one's pieces off the board before the other players. The game board is hexagonal in shape; it has a large image of a Chinese dragon in the middle, and a Chinese character in each board position. Gameplay If you have two players, one player is given ten white game pieces while the other player gets ten black game pieces. The pieces are stacked in the middle of the board as one stack of 4 pieces, one stack of 3 pieces, one stack of 2 pieces and one stack of 1 piece. If you have 3 or 4 players then each player gets 6 pieces, stacked in the middle in stacks of 3, 2 and 1. Each player takes turns moving their pieces in an attempt to get to the exit space on the game board. A player can only move a piece that is on top of a stack or that is the only piece left in a stack. The height of the stack determines how far you can move your piece. Therefore; a piece in a stack of 1 can only move 1 space forward, a piece in a stack of 2 can move 2 spaces forward. A player may decide which of the two starting positions to move their piece to, both positions lead to one exit position and no piece can be moved backwards. During your turn, you can stack any of your colored pieces on top of any other single piece, empty position, or existing stack. After the game starts there is no limit to how many pieces can be in a stack. You can move any of your pieces forward, even if you still have pieces in the start square. If during the game one of your pieces lands on the trampoline space (flower marked with a red border) he may choose to forward that piece the same amount of spaces as he used to reach the trampoline space. The finish position is after the last square on the board. You do not have to land exactly on it. If you have moved a piece to the finish take it off the board out of play. The game is over when a player has moved all their pieces off the board. There are two types of play for when you have no possible moves. In regular gameplay if no piece of your color is on top of a stack or by itself on a square, you cannot move any of your pieces. You can however, move any other players pieces forward, or you can lose your turn. Additionally there are professional rules in this scenario. They state that if you have no possible moves you must skip your turn and wait until one of your pieces is free to move. Additionally in two player games the person to start the game can use their initial turn to move two pieces at once. Then the next player moves one piece, according to the main rules. Usually if there are only two players in the game the regular rules apply.

As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party he represented Westmeath from February 1883 to November 1885. In 1885 he was elected for the new constituency of Dublin Harbour, which he represented until his death in 1910. He served as Lord Mayor of Dublin three times from 1901‚Äì04. He was educated at the Catholic University of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin. He owned two newspapers, United Ireland and the Kerry Sentinel and was a member of the so-called Bantry band of prominent nationalist politicians from the Bantry vicinity. They were also more pejoratively known as the Pope's brass band. Tim Healy was another prominent member of this unofficial group. In 1884, Harrington published a pamphlet, \\"Maamtrasna Massacres - Impeachment of the Trials\\" in which he dismantled the Crown Prosecution's case against the eight men accused of the murders of the Joyce family on August 17, 1882. He provided evidence that Crown Prosecutor George Bolton had deliberately suppressed evidence that would have acquitted Myles Joyce, who was hanged, and four men who were sentenced to twenty years of penal servitude.Harrington, Timothy - Maamtrasna Massacre - Impeachment of the Trials - https://archive.org/stream/maamtrasnamassac00harr/maamtrasnamassac00harr_djvu.txt Harrington was secretary and chief organiser of the Irish National League (INL), supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell and was largely responsible for devising the agrarian Plan of Campaign in 1886. He became a pro-Parnellite Nationalist when the party split in 1891 continuing as secretary of the INL. In 1897 he proclaimed himself an Independent Nationalist and sided with William O'Brien's United Irish League from its early days. He was briefly considered as a possible alternative to John Redmond as leader of the re- united Irish Parliamentary Party in 1900 when he stood in the general election that year as a Nationalist again. Thereafter he became excluded from Redmond's closed circle of confidants, he retained sympathy with O'Brien, and represented the interests of the tenant farmersMiller, David W.: Church, State and Nation in Ireland 1898-1921, Land for the People p.86, Gill & Macmillan Dublin (1973), at the 1902 Land Conference negotiations which led to the enactment of the unprecedented Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act (1903). Harrington is celebrated by a statue erected in 2001 at the east end of Castletownbere near the Millbrook bar. On Saturday, 7 September 1901, the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Tim Harrington kicked off at the official ceremony to open Bohemian FC's new home, Dalymount Park.

At the National Aquarium in Baltimore, which opened in 1981, a walkway spirals up through the center of two gigantic cylindrical tanks, the Atlantic Coral Reef and the Shark Alley, which display sharks, sawfish, and other sea creatures.

The library was the first Polish public library, the largest library in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe. After the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising (1794), Russian troops, acting on orders from Czarina Catherine II, seized the library's holdings and transported them to her personal collection at Saint Petersburg, where a year later it formed the cornerstone of the newly founded Imperial Public Library. In the 1920s the government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic returned some of the former Za≈Çuski Library holdings to the recently established Second Polish Republic thanks to the Treaty of Riga. These holdings were deliberately destroyed by German troops during the planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, following the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising. History Vogel \\"House of the Kings\\" today (ul. Dani≈Çowiczowska 14, corner of ul. Hipoteczna 2, Warsaw) The Za≈Çuski brothers' greatest passion was books. J√≥zef Andrzej Za≈Çuski and his brother Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Za≈Çuski acquired the collections of earlier Polish bibliophiles such as Jakub Zadzik, Krzysztof Opali≈Ñski, Tomasz Ujejski, Janusz Wi≈õniowiecki, Jerzy Mniszech and Jan III Sobieski (the latter, from his granddaughter, Maria Karolina Sobieska). From the 1730s the brothers planned the creation of a library, and in 1747 they founded the Za≈Çuski Library (Biblioteka Za≈Çuskich). Located in the 17th-century Dani≈Çowicz Palace in Warsaw (built for Miko≈Çaj Dani≈Çowicz of ≈ªur√≥w), the library building had two stories (the large reading room was on the second floor) and was topped with a small tower containing an astronomical observatory. The building's reconstruction in rococo style was accomplished in 1745 by Francesco Antonio Melana and his brother. The Za≈Çuski Library was considered the first Polish public library and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world. In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries that could boast such holdings. The library initially held some 200,000 items, which grew to some 400,000 printed items, maps and manuscripts by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens. This library, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., asked patrons to be quiet and to say a prayer in the intention of the Za≈Çuski brothers. It was prohibited to take the books outside the library, as the book theft was a growing problem, to an extent that the bishop patrons decided to ask the pope for help. Responding to their request, in 1752 pope Benedict XIV issued a papal bull that threatened to excommunication individuals taking the books from this library; even that did not eliminate the problem completely. exlibris After the brothers' deaths, the newly formed Commission for National Education took charge of the library, renaming it the Za≈Çuski Brothers' Library of the Republic. Twenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the second Partition of Poland and Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina Catherine II, emptied the library and dispatched the whole collection to Saint Petersburg, where the books formed the mass of the Imperial Public Library on its formation, a year later. Parts of the collections were damaged or destroyed as they were mishandled while being removed from the library and transported to Russia, and many were stolen. According to the historian Joachim Lelewel, the Zaluskis' books, \\"could be bought at Grodno by the basket\\". The collection was later dispersed among several Russian libraries. Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on two separate dates in the nineteenth century: 1842 and 1863. In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War and the Treaty of Riga the RSFSR's government returned around 50,000 items from the collection to Poland, yet German soldiers deliberately destroyed these items during the Planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, after collapse of the Warsaw Uprising. Only 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials from the original library survived the war. In 1821 the library's original home was altered into a tenement house. During the building's reconstruction, the busts of Polish monarchs that had originally adorned the library's interiors, and which had been hidden during the Partitions of Poland, were discovered and placed on the building's facade; hence the building came to be called the \\"House of the Kings\\" (Dom pod Kr√≥lami). The building was destroyed by the Germans during World War II. After the war, it was rebuilt under the Polish People's Republic. Today's Polish National Library (Biblioteka Narodowa), founded in 1928, considers itself the descendant of the Za≈Çuski Library.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride debuted as the world's first floorless roller coaster on April 2, 1999. It was repainted and rethemed at the end of the 2008 season, reopening in 2009 as Bizarro. History=Medusa Medusa was part of a $42 million expansion at Six Flags Great Adventure announced in January 1999, and was one of three roller coasters introduced in the expansion. The ride officially opened on April 2, 1999 as the first Floorless Coaster in the world. Bizarro On October 23, 2008, Six Flags announced that Medusa would be re-designed for the 2009 operating season. On April 1, 2009, Six Flags officially announced the details of Bizarro. Although no changes were made to the track layout, a new theme highlighting Superman's evil clone, Bizarro, was added. The track was repainted blue with dark purple supports and multiple special effects were added such as rings in the shape of Bizarro's S shield that the train passes through, and flame effects. The three trains also received on-board audio. Six Flags introduced an \\"alternate reality game\\" to market the re-themed ride. Bizarro opened on May 23, 2009, at the start of Memorial Day weekend. Ride experience=Layout Once the train is loaded and secured, the floor drops and the front bars that block the train from leaving while loading, open. After leaving the station, the train makes a U-turn to the left and begins to climb the tall chain lift hill. Once riders reach the top, they go through a small pre-drop before dropping to the left at a 55-degree angle. The train then reaches a top speed of and passes through several fogged Bizarro's S shields. Riders then enter the vertical loop followed by a turn to the right into the diving loop. Upon exiting the diving loop there is a burst of fire shot out on each side of the track. After the diving loop, the train passes the station and goes through a Zero G roll. The train then goes through a cobra roll, followed by a mid-course brake run which is located next to the lift hill. Similar to the first drop, the train drops to the left and enters a 270-degree helix followed by the two Interlocking corkscrews. The corkscrews interlock around a mist which sprays the riders with water. Riders go through a small dip then enter the final brake run before returning to the station. Once returned, the floors come back up and the bars close back up enabling riders to unload and next ones to load. Trains Bizarro train in station Bizarro operates with three steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats in a single row. When the ride was re-themed, the middle two seats of the last row were removed on each train to install a computer and power module for the on-board audio. This reduced the capacity of the trains from 32 to 30 riders per train. Each seat on every train has a speaker to the left and right of the rider. A recording of a montage of movie quotes is played for the duration of the ride. Frequently, while the train is braked, waiting to enter the station platform, riders hear Bizarro chanting his name and \\"Bizarro #1\\". For the 2013 season, the on-board audio speakers and the computer module were removed; this returned the train's capacity back to 32. By late-2013, Six Flags proposed that the audio equipment would be given to Six Flags America so that the park's stand-up roller coaster Apocalypse could be fitted with an audio track for the 2014 season. Track The steel track is approximately in length and the height of the lift is approximately . The first drop is . The track is blue and its supports are purple. The track was originally painted lime green. See also * Scream (roller coaster), a floorless roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

A linear settlement, it is approximately west of Wisbech, the nearest town. The village is named after the central thoroughfare along which the village developed, a green drove, much wider than the current metalled road (B1166). The population at the 2001 Census was 1,030. The population is included in the civil parish of Wisbech St Mary. Other nearby towns include Peterborough, to the west, and King's Lynn, to the east. History The area was farmed by the Romans, who left evidence of their presence in several places throughout Parson Drove and the surrounding parish. Samuel Pepys wrote about Parson Drove in his diary for 17 September 1663, describing it as a \\"heathen place\\" where he found his uncle and aunt in a \\"sad poor thatched cottage\\", after which he took them to a \\"miserable inn\\" (the Swan Inn), where he was staying, and where his uncle's horse was subsequently stolen. A lawyer's clerk from London was, by his uncle and aunt, suspected as the thief, who was then detained at the inn. At about midnight Pepys, after he had retired to a \\"cold, stony chamber\\", was informed that the horse was found. Landmarks Woad mill, Parson Drove by James Doyle Penrose (1906) Parson Drove has buildings dating from the 16th century, ten of which are Grade II listed. The village has three public houses, including The Swan Inn, in which Pepys stayed in the 17th century. The village churches are The Emmanuel Church (also called the \\"New Church\\") which dates from 1873 and contains chandeliers originally from St Paul's Cathedral, and St John the Baptist (also called the \\"Old Church\\") which dates from the 12th century, and includes additions and renovations from the 14th, 15th, and 17th centuries; it is Grade II* listed, and under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.\\"Church of St John the Baptist, Parson Drove, Cambridgeshire\\", Churches Conservation Trust. Retrieved 8 January 2019 The Cage was built in 1829 as a village lock-up for local criminals and stray livestock, and housed the village fire pump for nearly 100 years. The last working temporary woad mill in Britain was in Parson Drove.\\"Woad Mills, Woad.org.uk. Retrieved 8 January 2019 It stood opposite St John the Baptist church, and closed in 1910. It was pulled down in 1914 and the last permanent woad mills at Algarkirk(1927) and Skirbeck(1932). A model of the woad mill is in Wisbech & Fenland museum.  Education  The village is served by the Alderman Payne Primary School - formerly known as the Payne County Primary School, the Payne Council School and the Parson Drove Council School.

Romero and Dario Argento. The two filmmakers had previously worked together on the immensely popular Dawn of the Dead in 1978. The film is split into two separate tales, both based largely on the works of Edgar Allan Poe: \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\", directed by Romero and starring Adrienne Barbeau, showcases his traditional mix of horror with social commentary; and \\"The Black Cat\\", directed by Argento and starring Harvey Keitel, which blends a number of Poe references into a new narrative. Both of the tales were filmed and take place in contemporary Pittsburgh. Plot=\\"The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar\\" Jessica Valdemar, an attractive 40-year-old woman, rides in a taxi to the downtown Pittsburgh office of Steven Pike, her elderly husband's lawyer, with some paperwork for Mr. Pike's approval. Pike sees that Jessica's 65-year-old husband named Ernest Valdemar, who is dying from an unnamed terminal illness, is liquidating a number of his assets for cash and suspects Jessica of having undue influence on him. Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone call to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agrees to let Jessica have access to the money, but warns her that if anything were to happen to Mr. Valdemar within the next three weeks before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities. Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate by hypnotizing him and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica doesn't like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $300,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep. The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking the body, they hear Ernest Valdemar's voice coming from the still body claiming that his soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Valdemar tells them that he sees \\"others\\" in the dark void looking at him. While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar's undead corpse who tells him that the \\"others\\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar's corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar's body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \\"the others\\" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keeps on coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead. Robert finally tells Valdemar that he's going to wake him and free him from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. \\"They're with you now!\\" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house. Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly \\"Others\\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body. Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert's apartment to answer complaints about a \\"strange smell\\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, while telling him that there is nobody to wake him up and that he is trapped forever. \\"The Black Cat\\" Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: \\"still life‚Äôs my art,\\" a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities‚Äîled by Detective LeGrand‚Äîto document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives. After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel's relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel's talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life. Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel's excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat's apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled Metropolitan Horrors, a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures. As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he's executed for the murder of the cat. One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod. Meanwhile, Rod is drinking heavily at a local bar. He becomes unnerved when the barmaid, Eleonora, gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel's own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome death when Rod hacks her with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong. Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel's disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, she confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about her suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel's friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask about her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat from behind the wall. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump. The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel's whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod isn't fazed by these questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls. Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall he put up is torn down and his crime scene is gruesomely revealed: the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel's tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. Not to be outdone, Rod grabs the pick-axe from LeGrand's partner and in seconds kills both policemen. Handcuffed and in panic, Rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after hearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. Rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. But his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck, asphyxiating and killing him. The black cat makes a final appearance, and stares at the fate Rod had coming for him. Production notes Romero collaborator Tom Savini provides the film's special make-up and gore effects, and appears briefly in \\"The Black Cat\\" episode playing a serial killer who looks like Edgar Allan Poe himself. It was Julie Benz's first acting role and the first feature film she starred in. Her role in the movie is small as a teenage violin student in a few scenes in \\"The Black Cat\\" episode. Benz's voice was dubbed in the Italian-language version of the film by Dario Argento's daughter, Asia.

Owned by the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission, it is a sister station to National Public Radio (NPR) member WNGH- FM (98.9 MHz). WNGH-TV's transmitter is located at Fort Mountain State Park east of Chatsworth. The station is operated as part of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) television network. The height of WNGH-TV's transmitter gives it one of GPB's largest coverage areas. It penetrates for some distance into the area of Chattanooga, Tennessee; Chatsworth and Dalton are part of the Chattanooga media market. It provides at least secondary coverage as far north as Athens, Tennessee, and as far south as metro Atlanta's north-northwestern suburbs, many of which can no longer receive GPB's flagship station, WGTV (channel 8). Two translator stations help bring the signal to the mountainous parts of the service area. Some network program duplication occurs with WTCI-TV (channel 45), the main PBS station for the Chattanooga area. History The station made its first broadcast on January 30, 1967, as WCLP, a National Educational Television (NET) and Georgia Educational Television network affiliate. It was Chattanooga's first educational television station, joined by WTCI-TV in 1970. On February 2, 1979, the station branded itself as WCLP-TV. In 2002, WCLP's digital signal started on channel 33\\\\. On April 15, 2008, WCLP-TV changed its call sign to WNGH-TV, to match GPB's new local FM-radio station, WNGH-FM. The FM station's transmitter was moved to the same broadcast tower as the TV station atop a mountain within Fort Mountain State Park. Due to equipment failure in 2008, the station's analog signal operated at reduced power (1,500 kW, 30% of normal) until it switched entirely to digital. Translators WNGH has broadcast translators which extend the station's coverage into areas blocked by distance or terrain, notably by the north Georgia mountains. All of these translators have been located near the state's border regions with Alabama, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Currently, only the W12DK-D translator is operating, under a broadcast license which covered its construction permit in December 2009. It is atop Brasstown Bald, the highest point in the state, which is anticipated to be shared by the 97-watt GPB radio station WBTB FM 90.3. W12DK-D replaced two other stations: *W04BJ in Young Harris, Georgia, an analog station permanently off-air since a May 2008 equipment failure *W50AB in Hiawassee, Georgia, which was rejected for a digital license in May 2007, as it was then covered by W04BJ's broadcast range Four other stations near Alabama had their analog licenses and digital applications or construction permits canceled, apparently at GPB's request: *W27AA in Draketown, Georgia, which was canceled in November 2006 *W65AD in Cedartown, Georgia, which was canceled in September 2007 *W35AA in LaFayette, Georgia, which was canceled in July 2007 *W51AB in Flintstone, Georgia, which was canceled in September 2002 This was the largest number of translators assigned to any of the GPB stations. Two others are currently assigned to primary (parent) station WGTV, though all stations simulcast at all times. Digital television=Analog- to-digital conversion WNGH-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 18, on February 17, 2009. This was the original target date in which full- power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts. The station's digital signal remained on its pre- transition UHF channel 33. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as 18, its former UHF analog channel. On September 3, 2019, the station changed from UHF channel 33 to VHF channel 4, after winning several million dollars in the reverse auction portion of FCC auction 1000.

Notable publications include Casino Capitalism (1986), States and Markets (1988), The Retreat of the State (1996), and Mad Money (1998). Early life Susan Strange was born on 9 June 1923 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the London School of Economics (LSE) during the Second World War. Career Susan Strange earned a first in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1943; it would be twenty years before she established her reputation as an academic. She raised six children and worked as a financial journalist for The Economist, then The Observer until 1965, when she began to conduct full-time research. She remained a full-time researcher at Chatham House (formerly The Royal Institute of International Affairs). From 1978 to 1988, she served as the Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at LSE, and was the first woman at LSE to hold this chair and professorship. She served as professor of international political economy at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, from 1989 to 1993. Strange's final academic post, which she held from 1993 until her death in 1998, was as chair of international relations and professor of international political economy at the University of Warwick, where she built up the graduate programme in International Political Economy. She also taught in Japan, where between 1993 and 1996 she was several times guest lecturer at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo. She was a major figure in the professional associations in both Britain and the United States. She was an instrumental founding member and the first treasurer of the British International Studies Association and served as the third female president of the International Studies Association in 1995. Positions on international relations Strange played a central role in developing international political economy as a field of study in Britain. She claimed that in general, \\"economists simply do not understand how the global economy works\\" due to a poor understanding of power and an over-reliance on abstract economic models. However, she noted that political scientists also have a woeful understanding of international economics due to their emphasis on institutions and power. Thus she became one of the earliest campaigners advocating the necessity of studying both politics and economics for international relations scholars. Power and international financial markets States and Markets (1988) delineates four key channels that constitute power‚Äîsecurity, production, finance, and knowledge; power is the ability to \\"provide protection, make things, obtain access to credit, and develop and control authoritative modes of interpreting the world\\". Strange posits that the most overlooked channel of power is financial access, which consequently becomes the most important one to comprehend; in other words, she argues that one cannot comprehend how the world works without a thorough understanding of international financial markets. To illustrate, Casino Capitalism, published in 1986, discusses the dangers of the international financial system, which she considered confirmed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In this book, she defined \\"casino capitalism\\" as a form of capitalism that is extremely volatile and unpredictable as a consequence of the \\"speculatively-oriented lifts\\" in finance capital. There is a financial \\"contagion\\" creating a huge instability in the international financial markets. Her analysis in States and Markets (1988) focused on what she called the \\"market-authority nexus\\", the see-saw of power between the market and political authority. She maintained that the global market, relative to the nation state, had gained significant power since the 1970s and that a \\"dangerous gap\\" was emerging between the two. She considered nation states inflexible, limited by territorial boundaries in a world of fragile intergovernmental co-operation; \\"Westfailure\\" is what she called Westphalia. Markets would be able to flout regulations and reign free, creating more uncertainty and risk in an already chaotic environment. Position on the International Monetary System In Casino Capitalism, Susan Strange problemizes the nonsystem that the international monetary system has become. She compares it with a casino whereon the foreign exchange plays as snakes and ladders. She sets the stakes that international finance has become stronger than states and has been deregularized. The Smithsonian Agreement has been weak leading further to benign neglect from the US, the Eurodollar market and OPEC has been strong undermining the Bretton Woods system. There is no state or actor governing the international monetary system and the international financial markets. American banks are made free to pursue their interests since the 1980s strengthened by the possibility to finance American bonds in the world, making a carousel of bond trading with the OPEC and the Eurodollar market. The forces of market integration set by the Bretton Woods system was going through.Strange, Susan, Casino Capitalism, Manchester University Press, 1986, pp. 1‚Äì48 Personal life In 1942, she married Denis Merritt (died 1993); they had one son and one daughter, and the marriage was dissolved in 1955. In 1955 she married Clifford Selly, with whom she had three sons, and one daughter.

Created in Lw√≥w in 1867, by the end of World War I the movement had its units - gniazda (\\"Nests\\") - in all parts of Poland, as well as among the Polish communities abroad. The group's goal was to develop fitness, both physically and mentally, with a motto mens sana in corpore sano (\\"a fit spirit in a fit body\\").  History  Banner of the Bƒôdzin-based Sok√≥≈Ç nest Sok√≥≈Ç was formed February 7, 1867 in Lw√≥w, then a capital of Austro-Hungarian Galicia. The basic aims of the society were promotion of gymnastics and national revival in all parts of partitioned Poland. In 1885 the first chairman, J√≥zef Millert managed to convince the German authorities to allow for Sok√≥≈Ç \\"nests\\" to be formed in German-held parts of Poland. After the Revolution of 1905 the Sok√≥≈Ç expanded into the Russian Empire. As opposed to the Scouting movement which emerged in Poland simultaneously (largely promoted by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's socialists), the Sok√≥≈Ç tended to be right wing, with the majority of important posts taken by supporters of Roman Dmowski's National League. It promoted gymnastics and healthy life, as well as traditional moral values. The movement opposed football, as a plebeian sport. Because of that, many members left the organization in early 20th century and founded their own football clubs, among them the Czarni Lw√≥w - the first football team in Poland.  In Greater Poland  VIII All-Polish Congress of the \\"Falcon\\" Polish Gymnastic Society in Katowice, 1937 In Greater Poland, Sok√≥≈Ç became an important group dedicated to Polish independence. In the German partition of Poland, from the beginning, the Sok√≥≈Ç movement met with police persecutions, controls, harassment and provocations. This stopped only after the Sok√≥≈Ç accepted constant police supervision. Another change was that only adults could become members. Because of this, Sok√≥≈Ç president Bernard Chrzanowski, and vice-president Ksawery Zakrzewski, suggested setting up independent youth organizations, which would have rented, for a nominal pay, the gymnastic chambers by hours or days. Alfred Filip Zawady≈Ñski was the first founder of Sok√≥≈Ç, in Soko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski, Poland. German police began to harass and persecute all the new organizations again, and for a time forbade any further activity. Attorney Chrzanowski argued that the police had no proof and could present no link, neither personal nor financial, between these organizations and Sok√≥≈Ç. He took the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Justice in Berlin. It was shown that the president of \\"Iskra\\", Kazimierz Syller, \\"Brzask\\" Stanis≈Çaw Szulc, and of \\"Ogniwo\\" Edmund Maƒákowiak, nor any other adult member had ever been members of Sok√≥≈Ç. The jury canceled the laws, but this caused even more harassment from the Police and attempts to penetrate the organizations by informers began.  Between wars  Members of the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society in Wroc≈Çaw, 1910 After Poland regained her independence, in 1919 the nests formed in various partitions were united in the Union of Gymnastic Societies \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\". After the Polish defeat in 1939 the new Soviet and Nazi authorities banned the Sok√≥≈Ç and it was not allowed to emerge after the war. It was not until 1988 that the ban was lifted by the Communist authorities of Poland. During that time only minor nests continued their activity abroad, among the Polish diaspora in the United Kingdom, United States (Polish Falcons), France and several other countries. The following year, on January 10, the first nest since World War II was officially registered and on March 1, 1990, the society was again registered in Poland. Currently the organization has 86 nests and claims to have approximately 10,000 members both in Poland and abroad. Post WWII In 1947, the organization was officially delegalized by the communist authorities of the Polish People's Republic. All information relating to the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society was subject to censorship. The society was registered on 10 January 1989 and then on 1 March 1990 its name was changed to Union of \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Gymnastics Societies in Poland (ZwiƒÖzek Towarzystw Gimnastycznych \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" w Polsce). Currently, the union has an estimated number of 8,000 members organized in 80 groups known as gniazda (nests). The \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" union continues the traditions of its pre-WWII predecessor and is committed to instilling the values of patriotism, education and civic duty in its young members as well as strengthening the love of the country and a sense of national identity. In 2017, the Polish Sejm and Senate passed a special resolution commemorating the 150th anniversary of the foundation of the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society.

The state highway runs from Turkey Point within Elk Neck State Park north through North East to the Pennsylvania state line near Calvert, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 272 (PA 272). MD 272 is the main north-south highway of central Cecil County, connecting the Elk Neck Peninsula between the North East River and Elk River with U.S. Route 40 (US 40) and Interstate 95 (I-95) in North East, MD 273 in Calvert, and Rising Sun via MD 274. The section of MD 272 between North East and Bay View was paved by 1910. The remainder of the state highway north to Calvert and south to Elk Neck was completed in several sections in the 1930s. The first relocations of MD 272 occurred when both railroads near North East were bridged in the early 1940s and mid-1950s. Multiple relocations occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s along the whole length of the highway to eliminate curves and tie the state highway into I-95. MD 272 reached its current extent when it was extended south into Elk Neck State Park in 1979. Route description View north along MD 272 at MD 273 in Calvert MD 272 begins at an entrance to Elk Neck State Park at the trailhead for the Turkey Point Light, which lies at the end of the namesake peninsula between the Elk River to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west. The state highway heads north as two-lane undivided Turkey Point Road through a residential area before returning to the state park property. MD 272 passes through several curves and passes by access roads to campgrounds and the other features of the park and by the park headquarters. The state highway emerges from the state park and passes by the Rodney Scout Reservation before curving north at its intersection with Elk River Lane in the hamlet of Elk Neck. MD 272's roadway widens and parallels Arrants Road and Old Log Cabin Road; along the latter highway, the state highway passes between Sandy Cove Camp and the Black Hill unit of Elk Neck State Forest. The route crosses Hance Point Creek and parallels Hance Point Road across Ford Run and by North East Little League Park to where the roads meet on the edge of Chesapeake Bay Golf Club at North East. Immediately before entering the town of North East, MD 272 splits into a one-way pair composed of two-lane Mauldin Avenue northbound and one-lane Main Street southbound. Within town, Main Street passes by St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church and both streets intersect MD 7 (Cecil Avenue). North of MD 7, Mauldin Street reduces to one lane and both streets cross North East Creek, which becomes the North East River on the southwest side of town. The two directions of MD 272 come together heading northwest as Mauldin Avenue while Main Street splits north to a dead end, then the state highway crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and leaves the town limits. MD 272 gains a second lane northbound and intersects US 40 (Pulaski Highway), where the highway's name changes to North East Road. The state highway curves north at a tangent intersection with Rogers Road, where the highway becomes two lanes again. MD 272 parallels two segments of Leslie Road on either side of the state highway's bridge over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision at the hamlet of Leslie and passes east of a park and ride facility north of the railroad. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at Lums Road and parallels Marysville Road to its six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway). North of I-95 in the hamlet of Bay View, MD 272 parallels Old Bayview Road, reduces to a two-lane undivided road, and passes through an intersection with MD 274 (Joseph Biggs Memorial Highway) at the entrance to Cecil College. North of its junction with the northern end of Old Bayview Road, the state highway crosses North East Creek parallel with the Gilpin's Falls Covered Bridge. MD 272 heads north and parallels Old Zion Road through the hamlet of Zion. The state highway passes Rising Sun High School on its way to Calvert, where the highway intersects MD 273 (Telegraph Road). MD 272 parallels Quaker Lane and Walnut Garden Road south and north of MD 273, respectively. Quaker Lane leads to the East Nottingham Friends Meetinghouse and the Elisha Kirk House. MD 272 continues north from MD 273 as Chrome Road and passes to the west of the John Churchman House before reaching its northern terminus the Pennsylvania state line, where Chrome Road continues north as PA 272 toward Chrome and Nottingham. MD 272 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from School House Lane just south of North East to Old Bayview Road north of MD 274 in Bay View. History The first portion of MD 272 to be built was from Cecil Avenue in North East north to Old Farmington Road in Bay View. This highway was constructed as a macadam road by Cecil County with state aid by 1910. That road was resurfaced in 1926 and 1927; in addition, Main Street in North East was paved as a concrete road from US 40 (Cecil Avenue) to the south end of town. A second section of MD 272 was built as a concrete road from south of Zion to Calvert between 1927 and 1930. This northern section was extended north from Calvert to the Pennsylvania state line as a concrete road in 1932. MD 272 was extended south from North East to what is now Hance Point Road as a concrete road starting in 1930 and was completed to Hance Point Road by 1933. The highway was extended as a macadam road to Old Log Cabin Road in 1934 and 1935. The gap between Bay View and Calvert was filled, including a new bridge parallel to the Gilpin's Falls Covered Bridge over North East Creek, around 1936. MD 272 was completed from Elk Neck to the Pennsylvania state line when the final section of highway south to Old Elk Neck Road was constructed as a gravel road in 1938 and 1939. MD 272 northbound past US 40 in North East The first realignment of MD 272 occurred in 1941 when a bridge was constructed over the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) at the hamlet of Leslie north of North East. The Main Street bridge over North East Creek in North East was replaced in 1945 as an accelerated non-military wartime project approved by the War Production Board, replacing a 1903 truss bridge. The next realignment occurred with a bridge over the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in North East; the bridge and approaches were placed under construction in 1954 and completed in 1956. The railroad grade separation was the first of many projects to relocate and widen MD 272 over the next several years. The highway was reconstructed from the Pennsylvania state line to south of Calvert, including a relocation at Calvert, between 1956 and 1958. MD 272 was reconstructed from Elk Neck to south of Northeast in 1957 and 1958, bypassing three stretches of highway. The highway was reconstructed from south of Calvert to the bridge across North East Creek at Gilpin's Falls in 1958 and 1959, resulting in a bypass of Zion. The last major project to modernize MD 272 over this period took place along the highway from Leslie to Gilpin's Falls from 1958 to 1961. The new highway was built in anticipation of the Northeast Expressway (now John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway): A four-span bridge was built to cross the freeway between 1959 and 1961. The freeway itself and its diamond interchange with MD 272 were built between March 1962 and November 1963 and opened November 15, 1963. The new course of MD 272 bypassed the center of Bay View and part of the relocation built as part of the Leslie railroad grade elimination 20 years earlier. The highway's current travel pattern through North East was implemented in the late 1960s. Main Street was resurfaced in 1966, and the pre-existing portion of Mauldin Avenue from Thomas Avenue to MD 7 was transferred from town to state maintenance through a road transfer agreement on January 30, 1967. Mauldin Avenue was extended in both directions, including construction of a new bridge over North East Creek, in 1968 and 1969 to form the northbound component of a one-way pair. MD 272 reached its present length through a December 27, 1979, road transfer agreement that reassigned maintenance of Turkey Point Road south of Elk Neck from the county to the state. Another agreement the same day also transferred the old portions of MD 272, which had been redesignated sections of MD 699, to county maintenance. The state constructed the park and ride facility south of I-95 in 1999 and 2000. At the same time, MD 272 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from Lums Road to MD 274, and the north side of the I-95 interchange was reconstructed to form a partial cloverleaf, work that finished in 2001. The route's bridge across North East Creek at Gilpin's Falls was replaced in 2001 and 2002, and Main Street through North East underwent a streetscape project to revitalize the center of town in 2003. MD 272's bridge across Amtrak's Northeast Corridor is currently being replaced; construction began in 2015. The first phase of the bridge replacement was completed and opened to traffic in 2019, with the former bridge removed to allow for construction of the second phase. The second phase of the bridge replacement is expected to conclude in 2020. Junction listAuxiliary routes MD 272 has three former auxiliary routes. These routes were spurs between current MD 272 and segments of MD 699, which was the number assigned to bypassed sections of MD 272. All three highways were transferred from state to county maintenance in a road transfer agreement on December 27, 1979. *MD 272A was the designation for the spur between MD 272 and the northern end of MD 699A (Walnut Garden Road) at Calvert. The route was created after the completion of MD 272's realignment at Calvert in 1958. *MD 272B was the designation for the spur between MD 272 and the northern end of MD 699G (Rogers Road) in North East. The route was created after the completion of MD 272's realignment and bridge over the Pennsylvania Railroad in North East in 1956. *MD 272C was the designation for the spur between MD 272 and the southern end of MD 699E, the roadway of which no longer exists south of Peninsula Drive, between MD 272's bridge over the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and Peninsula Drive at Leslie. The route was created after the completion of MD 272's realignment between Leslie and Bay View in 1961.

She was a recipient of the Golden PEN Award. Early life She was born as Sybille Aleid Elsa von Schoenebeck in Charlottenburg, west of Berlin, to Maximilian Josef von Schoenebeck (1853‚Äì1925), a German aristocrat, retired lieutenant colonel and art collector, and his German Jewish wife, Elisabeth Bernhardt (1888‚Äì1937).Feldkirch in literarischen Zeugnissen Sybille was raised in the Roman Catholic faith of her father at Schloss Feldkirch in Baden. She had a half-sister by her father's first marriage, Maximiliane Henriette von Schoenebeck (later Nielsen, aka Jacko or Catsy). Her parents divorced in 1918, and she remained with her father, under somewhat impoverished circumstances in the midst of his art and wine collection. He died in 1925, when she was 14 years old, and Sybille went to live in Italy with her mother and stepfather, an Italian architectural student.Obituary for Sybille Bedford in The Telegraph, 21 February 2006. During those years she studied in England, lodging in Hampstead.. In the early 1920s, Sybille often travelled between England and Italy. With the rise of fascism in Italy, though, her mother and stepfather settled in Sanary-sur-Mer, a small coastal fishing village in Provence in the south of France, near Toulon and Marseilles. Sybille herself settled there as a teenager, living near Aldous Huxley, with whom she became friends. Bedford interacted with and was influenced by many of the German writers who settled in the area during that time, including Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht. Meanwhile, her mother became addicted to morphine, which had been prescribed by a local doctor, and became increasingly dysfunctional. In 1933, Sybille published an article critical of the Nazi regime in Die Sammlung, the literary magazine of Klaus Mann, the son of Thomas Mann. When her Jewish ancestry was subsequently discovered by the Nazis, her German bank accounts were frozen.Her mother was a German Jew, with some English ancestry. \\"I don't know to this day the actual percentage or exact provenance of my Jewish blood,\\" Bedford wrote in Quicksands: A Memoir. At this time it was difficult for her to renew her German passport, and staying in Italy without a valid passport or a source of income carried the risk of being deported to Germany. Aldous Huxley's wife Maria came up with a solution in 1935. Maria is known to have said, on the question of who should marry Sybille, \\"We need to get one of our bugger friends.\\" Sybille entered a marriage of convenience with an English Army officer, Walter \\"Terry\\" Bedford (an ex-boyfriend of a former manservant of W. H. Auden's), whom she described as a friend's \\"bugger butler\\",Recounted by Victoria Glendinning in Sybille Bedford: In Memory (Eland, 2007), p. 41. and obtained a British passport. The marriage ended shortly thereafter, but Sybille took her husband's surname, publishing all of her later work as Sybille Bedford. With assistance from Aldous and Maria Huxley, Bedford left France for America in advance of the German invasion of 1940. She followed the Huxleys to California and spent the rest of World War II in the United States. Career as a writer After the war, Bedford spent a year travelling in Mexico. Her experiences on that trip would form the basis of her first published book, a travelogue entitled The Sudden View: a Mexican Journey, which was published in 1953. Bedford spent the remainder of the 1940s living in France and Italy. During this time she had a love affair with an American woman, Evelyn W. Gendel,Sybille Bedford: Papers 1911‚Äì2001 at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin. who left her husband for Bedford and became a writer and editor herself.\\"Evelyn Gendel, 61, Senior Editor With Bobbs-Merrill Since 1952\\", The New York Times, 20 December 1977. In the 1950s Bedford became Martha Gellhorn's confidante. A Legacy, Bedford's second book and first novel, was published in 1956 and successfully televised by the BBC in 1975). It was described by Francis King as \\"one of the great books of the 20th century\\". Evelyn Waugh wrote in a letter to Nancy Mitford, \\"I wondered who this brilliant 'Mrs Bedford' could be.

It was a success and enabled Bedford to continue writing.Author's introduction to Penguin Modern Classics edition. In her lifetime, three more novels were published, as well as numerous works of non-fiction. In non- fiction she was best known as a travel writer and a legal reporter. In 1945 she met Esther Murphy, who would become her lover. The relationship lasted only a few years, but they remained lifelong friends. Bedford spent the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s living in France, Italy, Britain and Portugal, and during that period had a twenty-year relationship with the American female novelist Eda Lord.Joan Acocella: \\"Piecework.

It can be easily identified by its small size, dusty green leaves, very flattened growth pattern, and the white circular margin around the edge of its burgundy centered flowers. It is the only member of the former Chamaesyce genus that is native to the Santa Monica Mountains, although four invasive species have been introduced there, and lack a white margin on the flower. As with other typical members of the Euphorbia family, it has a white milky sap, and is poisonous. It is one of only 11 members of the Euphorbia native to California, and one of four native to the Santa Monica Mountains.Flowering Plants of the Santa Monica Mountains, Nancy Drew, p. 106, 1985, Description Euphorbia albomarginata is a common ground cover plant, usually growing less than 1/2 in (13 mm) high, with individual plants covering about a square foot, often growing closely and forming mats of vegetation. The flowers of this plant are tiny and edged in white, with a purplish center. It can be found in open fields, on roadsides, or anywhere where the ground is disturbed, including ornamental gravels in suburban yards, where it is considered as a weed. The former genus name Chamaesyce comes from the Greek word \\"chame\\", meaning \\"on the ground\\", and \\"syce\\" meaning \\"fig\\". This refers to the growth pattern of being flattened in all aspects, as if a box had been placed on it, so as to be lying very close to the ground.Flowering Plants of the Santa Monica Mountains, Rattlesnake Weed, Coastal, and Chaparral Regions of California, Nancy Dale, p. 107, 1985, One of the defining chaparral plants, Chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), derives from the same word. The flower has a circular burgundy center with a white ring around it. The epithet \\"albomarginata\\" (white-margined) refers to the \\"white\\" ringed \\"margin\\" of the flower \\"petals\\". The plant actually has no petals, but has modified leaves called \\"bracts\\", more round that the green leaves on the rest of the plant, which form a cuplike shape. The 12‚Äì30 male flowers are difficult to see, consisting only of one stamen each, and are clustered in the center of the cup. The single female flower is at the center, with an elevated ovary pendant on a long stalk, which when fertilized and mature, bears a capsule fruit, and so the name \\"syce\\" (\\"fig\\"). The leaves are round to heart shaped with the point of the heart away (ovoid) from the small stem attaching the leaf to the branch (petiole). The \\"nonflower leaves\\" are a peculiar \\"dusty green\\", with green but sometimes with burgundyish edges, and burgundyish stems, similar in color to the flower center inside the white ring, and particularly so after a late Spring or Summer rain. Uses The plant was formerly used as a folk remedy for snakebites (as a poultice or brewed as a tea) ‚Äì hence the common name \\"rattlesnake weed\\". However, this species is not proven to be medically effective in treating rattlesnake venom. Like most spurges, rattlesnake weed secretes an acrid, milky sap containing alkaloids poisonous to humans, with emetic and cathartic properties that may be misconstrued as curative. Among the Zuni people, the leaves and roots are eaten to promote lactation.Camazine, Scott and Robert A. Bye, 1980. A Study Of The Medical Ethnobotany Of The Zuni Indians of New Mexico.

Given a function f\\\\colon\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} with compact support the X-ray transform is the integral over all lines in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. We will parameterise the lines by pairs of points x,y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, x e y on each line and define u as the ray transform where : u(x,y) = \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f( x + t(y-x) ) dt. Such functions u are characterized by John's equations : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial y_j} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial y_i \\\\partial x_j}=0 which is proved by Fritz John for dimension three and by Kurusa for higher dimensions. In three- dimensional x-ray computerized tomography John's equation can be solved to fill in missing data, for example where the data is obtained from a point source traversing a curve, typically a helix. More generally an ultrahyperbolic partial differential equation (a term coined by Richard Courant) is a second order partial differential equation of the form : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i,j=1}^{2n} a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j} + \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{2n} b_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_i} + cu =0 where n \\\\ge 2, such that the quadratic form : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i,j=1}^{2n} a_{ij} \\\\xi_i \\\\xi_j can be reduced by a linear change of variables to the form : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\\\xi_i^2 - \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=n+1}^{2n} \\\\xi_i^2. It is not possible to arbitrarily specify the value of the solution on a non- characteristic hypersurface. John's paper however does give examples of manifolds on which an arbitrary specification of u can be extended to a solution. References * * √Å.

He is perhaps best known for directing the 1945 film The Seventh Veil and the 1950 version of the film King Solomon's Mines, an adaptation of an Allan Quatermain story. Biography Bennett was born in Tunbridge Wells, England. At the beginning of his career, he worked as a band leader and a commercial artist before trying his hand at amateur filmmaking. One of these early films helped him land a job at Alexander Korda's London Films in 1932. There, he became a film editor; later he would help make instructional and propaganda films for the British armed forces during World War II. Bennett's films tended to be sombre, but were very popular with the moviegoing public. In 1946, Bennett accepted an invitation to go to Hollywood for Universal.Looking at Hollywood Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune 14 Aug 1946: 23. It was, however, during this time that he directed King Solomon's Mines. He was replaced during filming by Andrew Marton.King Solomon's Mines: Part I Behlmer, Rudy. American Cinematographer; Hollywood Vol. 70, Iss. 5, (May 1989): 38-44. Bennett eventually returned to the UK. From 1954 to 1957, he left film work to pursue interests in the theatre and television, but produced four films in 1957, After the Ball, Man-Eater, That Woman Opposite and The Flying Scot. Although he continued to write and direct for film and television, his subsequent productions were not as well received. Bennett died in Sussex, England at the age of 74.

He missed the Olympics due to World War II, and retired from senior competitions in 1944, though he continued to vault into his sixties. He was inducted into the International Association of Athletics Federations Hall of Fame in 1974. Warmerdam was born in Long Beach, California, the son of Dutch emigrants Adrianus and Gertrude Warmerdam. He grew up in Hanford, California. Because of his ancestry he was more commonly known to both friends and, later, to the media as \\"Dutch\\". Warmerdam got his start in pole vaulting in his backyard using the limb of a peach tree and landing in a pit of piled up dirt. He was discovered by the local track coach and vaulted for Hanford High School until his graduation in 1932, after which he attended and vaulted for Fresno State University. Vaulting throughout his career with a bamboo pole, Warmerdam was the first vaulter to clear 15 feet (4.57 m), accomplishing that feat at UC Berkeley on April 13, 1940. However, that achievement was not ratified for a world record, and his later vault of 4.60 m on June 29, 1940 was the first ratified jump over 15 feet. During his career, Warmerdam vaulted 15 feet 43 times in competition, while no other vaulter cleared the mark a single time. Warmerdam surpassed the pole vault record seven times in a four-year span, and three of those marks were ratified as world records.

Local notes and coins were issued during both periods, but the Saar franc was never legally an independent currency. History=1920‚Äì1935 1-franc note of the Saar coal mine administration, 1920s The Treaty of Versailles stated in Article 45 that the newly-formed territory would be administered by the League of Nations for 15 years, and France was then granted the complete benefit of the Saar coal mines. The new French administration of the coal mines was granted the right to process all financial transactions with French francs. Therefore, from 1921 to 1923, the French franc was used alongside the German mark (‚Ñ≥), and from 1923 on, when the Saar Territory was incorporated officially into the French economy, the franc became the only valid currency. Due to the shortage of nonferrous metal, the coal mines administration began to print its own banknotes, the so-called \\"Grubengeld\\" (\\"coal mine money\\"). After 1930, these notes were replaced by the usual French notes. After the plebiscite of 1935, when the Saar Territory was unified with the German Empire again, the Reichsmark (‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥) was immediately introduced. The official exchange rate was 1 franc = 0.1645 ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥.The Saar money 1947‚Äì1959 On 16 July 1947, banknotes were issued for Saar denominated in marks, which replaced the German Reichsmark. But in November 1947, the French government reintroduced the French franc as the official currency. Between 20 November 1947 and 15 January 1948, all notes and coins had to be exchanged at a rate of 20 Saar marks = 1 franc. In 1954 the government of the Protectorate issued new coins in denominations of 10, 20, 50 and 100 francs. The coins resembled the coins of the French franc (same metallic composition, size and weight) and were officially and legally not a currency of their own, but only local issues of the French franc. After a referendum about the future status of the region, Saarland was incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany as a Bundesland on 1 January 1957. The economic integration into Germany was completed with the withdrawal of all Saar francs two years later. On 29 June 1959 the federal ordinance \\"Verordnung zur Einf√ºhrung der Deutschen Mark im Saarland\\"Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl., Federal Law Gazette) I, p. 402 stipulated that ‚Äì with effect from 6 July (¬ß 1) ‚Äì all debts, credits, deposits, wages, rents, fees, interest servicing, or amortisation payments, and other obligations, as well as cash reserves and prices denominated in francs were to be converted at the rate of 100 francs = 0.8507 Deutsche Mark (¬ß 2).The Federal Republic of Germany fixed that rate and converted older obligations denominated in Saar francs at the same rate into Deutsche Mark. Cf. the federal act on compensations \\"Bundesgesetz zur Einf√ºhrung des Bundesgesetzes zur Regelung der r√ºckerstattungsrechtlichen Geldverbindlichkeiten des Deutschen Reichs und gleichgestellter Rechtstr√§ger (Bundesr√ºckerstattungsgesetz ‚Äì BR√ºG) im Saarland\\", which ‚Äì in its Art. II, No. 8 ‚Äì mentions the official rate. The conversion had been brought forward by half a year because of the accelerating depreciation of the French franc. The date was kept secret (called \\"day X\\") to avoid currency speculation until two days in advance. The freedom to fix new prices was maintained, but especially temporarily or permanently-fixed obligations, not to be altered at any time, were to be not renegotiated but converted at the rate fixed. Appearance and acceptance 100-franc coin Pictures on coins of Saar Protectorate always depicted things related to industry and mining in the region. Moreover, the coat of arms of the Saar Protectorate appears on every coin. Coins of 10, 20 and 50 francs depicted a factory and mining tower, with the coat of arms of the Saar Protectorate in front of them. 100-franc coins depicted a gearwheel, again with the coat of arms of Saar Protectorate in front of it. All four coins were identical to the official French coins in color, size and weight and only the writing and the picture was different. There were no smaller coins, as the usual French coins (1, 2, 5 francs) were used instead. All French coins were accepted in the protectorate, but the Saar coins were usually not accepted in France except in the bigger cities adjacent to the border.

When he was nine years old, his family fled to Meknes, Morocco, escaping the local antisemitic vizier. He soon married a relative of his, named Fatzunyah, whose father supported him, letting him study Torah without the burden of supporting a household; he did not end up having any children with her, so he later would marry a second wife named Esther Bibas. When his father-in-law passed away in 1724, his financial situation worsened, although the burden of support shifted to his father. At this time, he also ran a yeshiva in Sal√©. When a famine hit Morocco, he decided to leave his native country and settle in the Land of Israel, then part of the Ottoman Syria. En route, he was detained in Livorno by the rich members of the Jewish community who established a yeshiva for him. This was in 1739. Many of his pupils later became prominent and furnished him with funds to print his Or ha-·∏§ayyim (). Chaim was received with great honor wherever he traveled because of his extensive knowledge and keen intellect. Before permanently settling in the Land of Israel, he went to Algiers where he recruited students for a yeshiva he was planning on opening in the Land of Israel. He soon arrived at the Acre port in the Land of Israel with his two wives and thirty students. However he could not immediately proceed to Jerusalem, due to an epidemic. In the middle of 1742 he arrived in Jerusalem, where he founded Yeshivat Knesset Yisrael. One of his disciples there was Chaim Yosef David Azulai, who wrote of his master's greatness: \\"Attar's heart pulsated with Talmud; he uprooted mountains like a resistless torrent; his holiness was that of an angel of the Lord,... having severed all connection with the affairs of this world.\\" On July 7, 1743, less than a year after his arrival in Jerusalem, Chaim passed away; it was on a Shabbat. It is said that that week in Europe, the Baal Shem Tov was sitting at Seudah shlishit, and before anyone in the area could have found out about Chaim's death, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúThe light from the West has been extinguished!‚Äù He is buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery in Jerusalem, Israel.

It was at par with the German Reichsmark, and composed of six denominations of banknotes, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 Mark. The aim of its introduction was to prepare an economic union of the Saar with France. In addition, the exchange enabled the French administration to get an overview of the total amount of capital available in the Saar region. It also served to prevent speculative capital transfers between the Saar and the rest of Germany in view of the introduction of the franc. However, the Saar Mark notes were soon replaced following the integration of the Saar into the French currency area. The Saar franc was the currency of the Saar Protectorate and, later, the state of Saarland in the Federal Republic of Germany between 20 November 1947 and 6 July 1959. It was valued at par with the French franc, and French coins and banknotes circulated alongside local issues.

Construction was started in the 16th century when the power of cannon meant that the existing stronghold at Mont Orgueil was insufficient to defend the Island and the port of St. Helier was vulnerable to attack by ships armed with cannon. It is named after Elizabeth I who was the queen of England around the time the castle was built. History The tidal island called L'Islet (The Islet) lying in Saint Aubin, Jersey (St Aubin's Bay) became the site of the Abbey (later Priory) of Saint Helier. The Crown confiscated the monastic buildings at the Reformation. Surviving buildings were used for military purposes. 16th centuryUpper Ward= Upper Ward (foreground). Construction of the earliest parts of the castle, the Upper Ward including the Queen Elizabeth Gate, began in 1594. This work was carried out by the Flemish military engineer Paul Ivy.Castles in Jersey Governors of Jersey moved their official residence from Mont Orgueil to Elizabeth Castle. 17th century Sir Walter Raleigh Governor of Jersey between 1600 and 1603, named the castle Elizabeth Castle after Elizabeth I of England. =Lower Ward= The Lower Ward in 2008. The long terrace on the right is the barrack building The Lower Ward was constructed, between 1626 and 1636, on the site of the ruined Abbey church. This area of the castle became a parade ground, surrounded by a barrack building and officers' quarters. Wells and cisterns for water existed within this area. = English Civil War = The castle was first used in a military context during the English Civil War in the 17th century. The Prince of Wales visited the castle in 1646 and again, but now as Charles II in September 1649, staying in the Governor's House, having been proclaimed King by governor Sir George Carteret, despite the abolition of the monarchy in England, in February 1649. In 1651, a windmill was constructed half-way between Fort Charles and the Lower Ward. In the same year, the Parliamentarian forces landed in Jersey and bombarded the castle with mortars. The destruction of the medieval Abbey church in the heart of the castle complex which had been used as the storehouse for ammunition and provisions forced Carteret to surrender on 15 December 1651 after being besieged for seven weeks. Jersey was held by Parliamentarians for the next nine years until the restoration of the monarchy. A 1651 depiction of the Castle In 1668, or shortly afterwards, King William's Gate was constructed, which is located between the Outer Ward, and Lower Ward. 18th centurySeven Years' War= During the Seven Years' War, French prisoners were kept at the island. Perhaps the most well known was Jean-Louis Le Loutre. The castle was next involved in conflict in the late 18th century, this time it was with the French. French troops under Baron Phillipe de Rullecourt landed in St Helier on 6 January 1781, and the castle garrison was marooned. The governor Moise Corbet was tricked into surrendering to the French, but the castle garrison under Captain Mulcaster refused to surrender. The French were eventually defeated by troops under Major Francis Peirson at the Battle of Jersey. Both Peirson and de Rullecourt were killed during the battle. The perceived vulnerability of the Island led to the construction of Fort Regent on Le Mont de la Ville, purchased by the British government from the Vingtaine de la Ville overlooking the Town. Fort Regent became the site of the main British garrison. 19th century A two- story barracks hospital building was constructed in the early 19th century. Pilgrims approaching Elizabeth Castle at low tide on Saint Helier's Day Pilgrimage on 17 July 2005 A plan to link the castle to the mainland as part of an ambitious harbour project in the 19th century was abandoned. A breakwater linking L'Islet to the Hermitage Rock on which the Hermitage of Saint Helier is built remains, and is used by anglers. 20th century The British government withdrew the garrison and relinquished the castle to the States of Jersey in 1923. The States then opened it to the public as a museum. During the Second World War the Germans, who occupied the Channel Islands, modernised the castle with guns, bunkers and battlements. After the Liberation, the castle was repaired and was eventually re-opened to the public. 21st century Each year, on the Sunday closest to St. Helier's Day, 16 July, a municipal and ecumenical pilgrimage is held to visit the Hermitage. As part of the pilgrimage an open-air service is held within the castle. Other cultural events, such as concerts and historical re-enactments are also held from time to time. On 4 June 2012, a beacon was lit to celebrate Elizabeth II's 60 years of reign. A fireworks display followed. Historic monument Charming Betty ascending the slipway at Elizabeth Castle, Saint Helier Today, Jersey Heritage administers the site as a museum. Among the historical displays is the regimental museum of the Royal Jersey Militia that holds several centuries of military memorabilia. There is also a museum that discusses the evolution of cannons and fortifications that holds several pieces from the nineteenth century, and earlier. Every Sunday through the season when the castle is open, a team of Historical Interpreters recreate the garrison of 1781, at the time of the battle of Jersey. They give displays of musket and cannon firing, and civilian life. Access to the castle is via a causeway from St Helier at low tide, or on a castle ferry. There are two ferries, Charming Betty and Charming Nancy, which are wading vehicles that can reach the castle regardless of tide height, weather permitting. A one-way trip when the tide is high takes about 15 minutes.

In a routine, a squad will incorporate a specific dance style (i.e. hip hop, jazz, or lyrical), technical work (leaps, turns, kicks, splits, jumps), and, depending on the routine, pom-poms and/or cheers. A pom squad slightly differs from a regular dance squad in that it uses pom-poms in all its dance routines, whilst a regular dance squad may or may not do pom work in a dance routine. Dance teams are also popular in performance dance, especially at sporting events, most commonly performing during the pre-game and halftime periods (and, in a number of cases, on the sidelines) of football and basketball games. A dance team can also include: a jazz team, ballet team or any kind of religion dance team. Spartan Gs, a collegiate dance team Dance is a highly competitive activity. Youth/association, middle school, high school, collegiate, all-star, and professional teams, compete on local, regional, state, national, and international levels. Teams are judged on a number of criteria including form, team unison, showmanship, precision of motions, jumps, leaps, turns, choreography, enthusiasm, and, in the case of pom squads, visual use of poms- poms. Pom squads are like cheerleading or dance, but they use poms (pom-poms). Pom squads also use kicklines in their routines, after they set down their poms, or choose to hold them during the kickline. A kickline routine is a routine of kicks, which cheerleaders also use: high kicks, fan kicks, low kicks, and kicks that go to their waist. Pom squads regularly compete in competitions and perform at sporting events. Overview Dance squads emphasize precise, synchronized motions along with technical dance skills (such as jumps, turns, and leaps). Their routines encompass various styles of dance including the more usually incorporated hip hop, jazz, lyrical, and kickline styles, to the more unusually used styles like disco, rock and roll, and gospel. A key feature of the dance is the ability to change formations very smoothly. Types of dance squads=High school and collegiate pom Traditional high school dance/pom squads include competition, performance dance, and promoting school spirit with dance. Dance/pom is usually a year- round sport, performing in competitions and at sporting events, most commonly football and basketball games. Some schools also have their dance team perform short sideline dances, and some dance teams also perform at school pep rallies. College dance squads are like traditional high school squads in that both include competition and performance dance, but there are many differences between the two. For example, a college squad will most likely dance on the sidelines at games or have a specific spot in the stands, but some high school teams will also perform on the sidelines. All-star The U.S. All Star Federation governs all-star dance-pom squads. Tryouts for all-star dance squads may be conducted in different ways. Some teams have only one tryout in the spring, whereas others may have a tryout in the spring and another in the fall. Some squads have year-round open tryouts where anyone can try out at any time during the season. The opportunity to compete in many large competitions attracts dancers to all-star programs. All-star dance teams can compete regionally, nationally, and even internationally. Texas dance/drill teams Most high schools in Texas have a precision dance/drill team, usually with 25-75 members. The traditional uniform for teams typically includes a white hat and white boots, with team officers wearing a solid white uniform while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines, usually in the style of kick, prop, military, or pom, at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies. They often conclude the year with a spring show in late April or early May. Texas dance/drill teams are structured with a chain of command similar to the military including captains and lieutenants leading squads. Traditionally, Texas drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years. Several colleges in Texas also have dance teams. Well-known teams include the Kilgore College Rangerettes and the Tyler Junior College Apache Belles. A fierce but friendly rivalry between KC & TJC has existed since the Apache Belles were formed in 1947. The Rangerettes were the first college drill team created in 1939 by Miss Gussie Nell Davis.http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/history_drillteam.htm In 1960, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, created the Strutters at Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University), the first precision dance team created at a four-year university.http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/history_drillteam.htm MSHSL dance team In Minnesota, competitive high school dance team is regulated under the Minnesota State High School League. The season begins after a two- week choreography period in October and ends after the state tournament in February each year. Team selection is led by the coaching staff in a tryout process individual to each participating school. Teams within this league are able to compete in one of three class divisions: A, AA, or AAA and in one or both of two categories: high kick or jazz. The high kick division requires a routine that ranges from 2:30 to 3:00 in length, contains 45-60 kicks performed by all members, and consists of up to 34 competing members. The jazz division has a range between 2:00 and 2:30 in length and may have up to 26 competing members. Music selection is done by the coaching staff and/or members of the team. Throughout the state, a wide variety of costume styles are worn to enhance the theme or mood of each routine. During the competition season, teams compete within their designated conference, at team invites, within designated sections, and may qualify to compete at the state tournament. Visit MSHSL dance team judging for more information on dance team scoring process. In addition to competitions, MSHSL dance teams also can perform at invitationals and school events including pep fests and basketball games. Professional Professional cheerleading incorporates a lot of pom dance styles, particularly in NFL Cheerleading and NBA Cheerleading. Tryouts Many dance squads both in high school and college require everyone to attend a tryout. These are typically held in the spring or early summer, before most sports begin. There are many different aspects of a tryout. The first thing many tryouts do is go through basic dance techniques that will be used during the season. These include but are not limited to toe touches, fouett√© turn combinations, kicks, and switch leaps. Other things that are many times included in a dance team tryout is the expectation that you can quickly master multiple short routines in different styles. Depending on what type of dance team the tryout is for will depend on what styles of dance you must know. NDA teams compete with routines that must incorporate jazz, hip hop, and pom styles, so many times you will learn a routine in each of these types of dance and then perform them shortly thereafter in front of a panel of judges. Competitions In 1967, the legendary Dr. Kay Teer Crawford (1914-2001) founded Miss Dance Drill Team USA, which is historically verified as the first national dance team competition for precision dance teams, drill teams, and dance-sport teams in the United States. This event is recognized as the origin of the worldwide dance competition industry and hosts dance squads from elementary schools, secondary schools, and dance studios from across the United States. In 1981, Crawford started the world's first international dance/drill competition (Miss Dance Drill Team International World Championships) which has regularly hosted past international dance teams from the United States, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, England, Germany, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, and South Africa. In 1991, Crawford founded the world's first national hip hop dance competition: National Street Dance USA. All events are held in the continental United States, with national events held in California each year. The international dance competition has been held in Japan, Australia, South Africa, and the United States. Champion Tours & Events, Inc. conducts competitions for secondary school and all-star dance teams. It holds national competitions in New York City at the College of Staten Island, in Los Angeles at the Mater Dei High School, and in Orlando, Florida at the University of Central Florida. The Universal Dance Association, founded in 1980, holds a national championship for high school, college, and all-star dance teams at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. Approximately 300 high school, college, and all-star teams compete at the competition annually.

It is set during the time of the American Civil War. The plot concerns the story of Liberty Fish and his travels after joining the Union army. The New York Times compared the story to the obvious Heart of Darkness, but also said, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a better bet (on the plot). Most of the people Liberty meets (and not just in the South) are what the Cheshire Cat would call 'mad,' from a shaggy hermit to the Georgia farmer who secedes from the Confederacy by reclaiming his little plot of land in the name of the Union.\\" Liberty Fish is the son of two passionate abolitionists but whose grandparents were cruel slave-owners. The plot follows him from his birth to young adulthood, his enlistment in the Union army, and his quest to find his grandparents who he blames for the despair his mother feels. The tone has hints of dark humor and at times can be heavily surreal.

Funky Koval is a 4-part Polish science fiction/detective story/political fiction genre comic book published in Poland in the 1980s. It gained a cult following and is still recognized as one of the best Polish comics. History The scenario for the comic was created by Maciej Parowski and Jacek Rodek; the drawings were done by Bogus≈Çaw Polch. It was first published in November 1982 on four black and white pages in the second issue of Fantastyka, a Polish sci-fi magazine. The first episodes were more of the 'comic short story' format, and have generated both much praise and critique among the readers. Later, the comic moved from short story format to more lengthy, novel-like plots. Plot-wise the series has never ended. With the release of the 'Komiks-Fantastyka' series in 1987 comics were moved rereleased in this comic spin-off, and Koval was soon released in 3 albums (Bez oddechu (Without rest), Sam przeciw wszystkim (Alone against everyone), Wbrew sobie (Against oneself)). The first album, Bez oddechu, contained collected stories published earlier (1982-1983), reprinted in Fantastyka, colored and with some additional panels to allow more seamingless transition between various stories. The second collected the 1985 more novel- like story; the third - the 1991-1992 story. All comics debuted in 'Fantastyka' and were later released as color albums. In 2002 it was reprinted again in a mega-album Klasyka Polskiego Komiksu - Funky Koval, it also contained the beginning of the fourth series - \\"Bez litosci\\" (Without mercy). Gossip and semi-official promises about that new parts of the comics have been circulating for many years, but no official announcement have been made until 2010, when it started to be serialised in the SF monthly Nowa Fantastyka. The fourth part is eventually titled \\"Wrogie przejƒôcie\\" (Hostile takeover).Poland's cult scifi/detective comic Funky Koval getting adapted. IMDb. 5 October 2009 Karol Wi≈õniewski Funky Koval powr√≥ci we wrze≈õniu Aleja Komiksu 2010-06-23 Art Sample page from Funky Koval #1 A notable feature of the comic is the art of Bogus≈Çaw Polch, known for his unique style and minute attention to details. He was known to put much more details into his drawings than could be actually printed in the comics; many of his panels are rich with tiny details - for example, in one panel showing Koval's room the reader can see names of the books and magazines on his bookshelf (they include works by Philip K. Dick, Stanislaw Lem and the 'Fantastyka' magazine). Many gadgets have logos of known companies (such as Sharp and Sony), and their characteristics shapes - of videophones, guns, spaceships or flying cars - are also one of the trademarks of that comic book. The art in the third series is different from that in the first two: in the third series Polch experimented with more simple style, sometimes bordering on caricatures. This change proved to be a disappointment to some fans used to his earlier, more detailed and realistic style. Story Cover of Funky Koval #2 from the 1980s, Poland. The plot resolves around the figure of former military pilot and now space detective, Funky Koval, who with his friends and colleagues forms a private detective agency \\"Universs\\" and solves various cases in the futuristic world of the 2080s. His investigations range from corruption in the police and government, through fighting cultists and terrorists, investigating missing spaceships and illegal slave camps, to the mystery of the Drolls aliens, who seem to have a much more advanced technology than the humans, and whose plans for the humanity - if any - remain a mystery. Cultural impact This comic book gained a cult following in Poland, partially due to the high quality of drawings and plot, and partially due to many subtle connections with the real world of the 1980s Poland (martial law in Poland, Jerzy Urban, Polish Round Table Agreement). Although some of those elements are no longer easily read by modern audience, the comic is still seen as one of the best Polish sci-fi works, and has influenced several more recent works.

The brush may be either in a solvated state, where the tethered polymer layer consists of polymer and solvent, or in a melt state, where the tethered chains completely fill up the space available. These polymer layers can be tethered to flat substrates such as silicon wafers, or highly curved substrates such as nanoparticles. Also, polymers can be tethered in high density to another single polymer chain, although this arrangement is normally named a bottle brush. Additionally, there is a separate class of polyelectrolyte brushes, when the polymer chains themselves carry an electrostatic charge. The brushes are often characterized by the high density of grafted chains. The limited space then leads to a strong extension of the chains. Brushes can be used to stabilize colloids, reduce friction between surfaces, and to provide lubrication in artificial joints. Polymer brushes have been modeled with Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo methods, Brownian dynamics simulations, and molecular theories.  Structure  Polymer molecule within a brush. The drawing shows the chain elongation decreasing from the attachment point and vanishing at free end. The \\"blobs\\", schematized as circles, represent the (local) length scale at which the statistics of the chain change from a 3D random walk (at smaller length scales) to a 2D in-plane random walk and a 1D normal directed walk (at larger length scales). Polymer molecules within a brush are stretched away from the attachment surface as a result of the fact that they repel each other (steric repulsion or osmotic pressure). More precisely, they are more elongated near the attachment point and unstretched at the free end, as depicted on the drawing. More precisely, within the approximation derived by Milner, Witten, Cates, the average density of all monomers in a given chain is always the same up to a prefactor: \\\\phi(z,\\\\rho)=\\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial z} n(z,\\\\rho)=\\\\frac{2N}{\\\\pi}\\\\arcsin\\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) where \\\\rho is the altitude of the end monomer and N the number of monomers per chain. The averaged density profile \\\\epsilon(\\\\rho) of the end monomers of all attached chains, convoluted with the above density profile for one chain, determines the density profile of the brush as a whole: \\\\phi(z)=\\\\int_z^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\partial n(z,\\\\rho)}{\\\\partial z}\\\\,\\\\epsilon(\\\\rho)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\rho A dry brush has a uniform monomer density up to some altitude H. One can show that the corresponding end monomer density profile is given by: \\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm dry}(\\\\rho,H)=\\\\frac{\\\\rho/H}{Na\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2/H^2}} where a is the monomer size. The above monomer density profile n(z,\\\\rho) for one single chain minimizes the total elastic energy of the brush, U=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\epsilon(\\\\rho)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\int_0^N\\\\,{\\\\rm d}n\\\\,\\\\frac{kT}{2Na^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z(n,\\\\rho)}{\\\\partial n}\\\\right)^2 regardless of the end monomer density profile \\\\epsilon(\\\\rho), as shown in.  From a dry brush to any brush  As a consequence, the structure of any brush can be derived from the brush density profile \\\\phi(z). Indeed, the free end distribution is simply a convolution of the density profile with the free end distribution of a dry brush: \\\\epsilon(\\\\rho)=\\\\int_\\\\rho^\\\\infty -\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}\\\\phi(H)}{{\\\\rm d}H}\\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm dry}(\\\\rho,H). Correspondingly, the brush elastic free energy is given by: \\\\frac{F_{\\\\rm el}}{kT}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{24N^2a^5}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\left{-z^3\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}\\\\phi(z)}{{\\\\rm d}z}\\\\right}{\\\\rm d}z. This method has been used to derive wetting properties of polymer melts on polymer brushes of the same species and to understand fine interpenetration asymmetries between copolymer lamellae that may yield very unusual non-centrosymmetric lamellar structures.  Applications  Polymer brushes can be used in Area-selective deposition. Area-selective deposition is a promising technique for positional self- alignment of materials at a prepatterned surface.

He also served as president of basketball operations for Philadelphia and Toronto. He is the son of Phoenix sports mogul Jerry Colangelo. He graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor of science degree in business management and applied economics. He was the 2005 and 2007 recipient of the NBA Executive of the Year Award. Early life Colangelo grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, where his father served as general manager (and eventually owner) of the Phoenix Suns. After graduating from Central High School, Colangelo attended Cornell University, where he played as a guard for the Cornell Big Red men's basketball team. After graduating from Cornell, he moved to New York City, where he worked in real estate. Front office career=Phoenix Suns Colangelo was hired by the Suns front office in 1991. In 1995, Colangelo succeeded his father as general manager of the Suns. During his tenure as Phoenix's general manager, Colangelo made a number of transactions that have received wide praise across the NBA, including the drafting of would-be superstars Shawn Marion and Amar'e Stoudemire. Colangelo traded Jason Kidd to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury, and then traded Marbury and oft- injured Penny Hardaway to the New York Knicks for several contracts. The additional salary cap space created by this trade allowed Colangelo to sign Steve Nash back from the Dallas Mavericks in the summer of 2004. Nash would go on to be the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 NBA Most Valuable Player, and the Suns would go 62‚Äì20 and claim the top playoff seed in the Western Conference in the 2004‚Äì05 season. As a result, Colangelo was awarded the 2005 NBA Executive of the Year Award. In the summer of 2005, Colangelo traded shooting guard Joe Johnson to the Atlanta Hawks for two future first-round picks and Boris Diaw, who then won the 2006 NBA Most Improved Player Award. Colangelo also dealt Quentin Richardson to the Knicks. After the loss of these two players and the loss of Stoudemire for virtually the entire season (only playing in 3 regular season games), the Suns once again led the Pacific Division. In addition to his work with the Suns, he served as president of Phoenix Arena Sports (PAS), the owning entity of the Arizona Rattlers team of the Arena Football League and the operating entity of the Phoenix Mercury team of WNBA from June 1991 through June 2002. The Rattlers won the championship in 1994 and 1997 and the Mercury played in the WNBA finals in 1998. He won the AFL Executive of the Year award in 1993 for his work with the Rattlers. Toronto Raptors In 2004, the Suns were sold to a group of investors led by Robert Sarver, although Colangelo stayed on as president and general manager. Shortly after the Raptors fired Rob Babcock in January 2006, rumors began swirling that the team was pursuing Colangelo despite the Raptors' claims that they were initiating an \\"exhaustive\\" search for a new general manager. On February 27, 2006, Colangelo resigned from his position with the Suns, and on February 28, 2006, the Raptors announced him as their new president and general manager. On May 23, 2006, Colangelo and the Raptors were awarded the first overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft. On June 8, 2006, Colangelo pulled his first trade since he joined the Raptors by swapping first-rounder Rafael Ara√∫jo for Robert Whaley and Kris Humphries with the Utah Jazz. He completed his second trade by sending forward Eric Williams, fan favorite Matt Bonner and a 2009 second- round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for center Radoslav Nesteroviƒç on June 21, 2006. The Raptors also announced that they had waived Whaley. Colangelo traded Charlie Villanueva, who was runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, for Milwaukee Bucks point guard T. J. Ford. Colangelo picked the 20-year-old Italian Andrea Bargnani with the first overall selection in the 2006 NBA Draft which was held in New York City on June 28, 2006. This also made Bargnani the first European selected first overall in the history of the NBA Draft. He also signed several free agents from European teams, including Jorge Garbajosa and Anthony Parker. However, the drafting of Bargnani would cause some serious criticism later on after performing lesser to expectations as a #1 selection. On July 16, 2006, Colangelo signed Bosh to a contract extension which was in effect starting from the 2007‚Äì08 season. The contract was for three years plus a player option for the fourth year, and had the potential to pay Bosh up to US$65 million over the four-year span. =2007: Executive of the Year= In 2007 the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division, with a 47‚àí35 record, for the first time in franchise history. Many have credited their significant turnaround from a 27‚Äì55 in the 2005‚Äì06 season to the changes made by Colangelo, in which he brought in nine new players to the Toronto Raptors' roster. Colangelo was awarded the 2007 Executive of the Year Award in the weeks following the Raptors' series loss to the Nets in the first round of the playoffs. During the offseason, Colangelo gave the 2009 and 2011 second-round draft picks to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Carlos Delfino. He also signed Jason Kapono to a multi-year contract with the Raptors. =2008‚Äì2013= On July 6, 2008, Colangelo traded point guard T.J. Ford to the Indiana Pacers for Jermaine O'Neal. In the trade the Raptors also acquired the draft rights to forward-center Nathan Jawai, the 41st overall selection in the 2008 NBA Draft, and sent center Rasho Nesterovic, forward Maceo Baston and the draft rights to the 17th overall selection, center Roy Hibbert, to Indiana. During the 2008-2009 season, the trade was regarded as being a failure for Toronto. Colangelo fired coach Sam Mitchell 17 games into the season, promoting assistant Jay Triano to head coach. Triano was the first Canadian-born head coach in NBA history. In the 2009 draft he picked DeMar DeRozan with the ninth pick. Two years later, in the 2011 draft he picked Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas with the fifth pick, although he would not play for the Raptors until 2013. In July 2012, Colangelo traded Gary Forbes and a first round pick for Kyle Lowry. In October 2012 he re-signed DeMar DeRozan to a 4-year deal worth $38 million. On May 21, 2013, MLSE announced that the Raptors were looking for a new general manager, but Colangelo would remain team president. On June 26, 2013, Colangelo stepped down as president of the Raptors. Although Colangelo had received substantial criticism in the latter part of his tenure as Raptors' general manager, he was credited with building the foundations for the Raptors' success under his replacement, Masai Ujiri. After his tenure with the Toronto Raptors ended, Colangelo did freelance scouting and consulting for other NBA executives and agents. In January 2016, Colangelo emerged as a top candidate to succeed Billy King as general manager of the Brooklyn Nets, though the team ultimately hired the San Antonio Spurs' assistant general manager Sean Marks instead despite not being considered a main competitor for the position at the time. Philadelphia 76ers In April 2016, the Philadelphia 76ers hired Colangelo as president of basketball operations. Colangelo's father, Jerry Colangelo, had been hired as chairman of basketball operations earlier in the season, but he soon stepped down from the chairman role after the younger Colangelo was hired as president. The older Colangelo still maintained a role as a special adviser for the team during this period. Sam Hinkie, the previous general manager of the team, also stepped down from his position days before Bryan Colangelo was hired. Colangelo drafted Ben Simmons, a former LSU point forward, as the first overall pick of the 2016 NBA draft; the team also selected Timoth√© Luwawu- Cabarrot and Furkan Korkmaz with first-round picks. Due to a fractured foot, Simmons missed the entirety of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Colangelo also signed Jerryd Bayless, Gerald Henderson, and Sergio Rodriguez during the 2016 off- season. At the 2017 trade deadline, Colangelo traded center Nerlens Noel to the Dallas Mavericks for Andrew Bogut, Justin Anderson, and two second round picks. In June 2017, Colangelo traded the third pick in the 2017 NBA draft and a future first-round pick to the Boston Celtics for the first overall pick of the draft, using that pick to select Markelle Fultz. During this second and final season, Colangelo helped the 76ers enter the playoffs with over 50 victories, as well as enter the second round of the playoffs that year. On May 29, 2018, The Ringer published an investigation alleging Colangelo used up to five secret Twitter accounts to disparage his predecessor, Hinkie, as well as several 76ers players including Joel Embiid and Jahlil Okafor. The next day, the 76ers announced that they were commencing an investigation into the matter. Colangelo denied the report in a statement. On June 7, 2018, Colangelo resigned as a result of the Twitter scandal. The situation related to his wife, Barbara Bottini, creating three of the five fake Twitter accounts involved that leaked potentially sensitive information about the Philadelphia 76ers organization, among other details. Colangelo also had an account, but he never used it for messaging purposes. The 76ers' head coach Brett Brown was named interim general manager at the time, holding onto the position from June 7 to September 20. On that day, former 76ers player Elton Brand was named the official general manager of the team. Personal life Before working for the Phoenix Suns, Colangelo worked for an upmarket commercial real estate firm on Wall Street for four years. Colangelo is married to Italian-born Barbara Bottini, and they have two children. In 2015, Colangelo was in the final stages of earning his permanent residency in Canada.

It was the first major confrontation between British troops and demonstrators in the city, belonging to Abdul Ghaffar Khan's non-violent Khudai Khidmatgar (servants of God) movement against the British Indian government. Estimates at the time put the death toll from the shooting at between the official count at 20, and the figure of 400 dead put forth by Pakistani and Indian sources. The gunning down of unarmed people triggered protests across British India and catapulted the newly formed Khudai Khidmatgar movement into prominence. Background The Khudai Khidmatgar (literally Helpers in the name of God), led by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, were a group of Muslims committed to the removal of British rule through non-violent methods. On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested after giving a speech in Utmanzai urging resistance to British rule. Ghaffar Khan's reputation for uncompromising integrity and commitment to non-violence inspired most of the local townspeople to take the oath of membership and join the Khudai Khidmatgar in protest.Johansen, p. 62. Simultaneous demonstrations were led by a cross section of civil society in and around Peshawar, led by Maulana Abdur Rahim Popalzai against discriminatory laws like the Frontier Crimes Regulation against the people of the province. Clashes at the Qissa Khwani bazaar After other Khudai Khidmatgar leaders were arrested, a large crowd of the group gathered at the Qissa Khwani bazaar. As British Indian troops moved into the bazaar, the crowd was loud and stones were thrown. A British Army dispatch rider was killed and his body burned.http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1977-02-39-2 Two British armored cars drove into the square at high speed, killing several people. It is claimed that the crowd continued their commitment to non- violence, offering to disperse if they could gather their dead and injured, and if British troops left the square. The British troops refused to leave, so the protesters remained with the dead and injured. At that point, the British ordered troops to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd.\\"Civil Disobedience 1930-31\\". Social Scientist (September ‚Äì October 1997) (Social Scientist, Vol. 25, No. 9/10) 25 (9‚Äì10): pp. 43‚Äì66. . Retrieved 2007-12-03. The Khudai Khidmatgar members willingly faced bullets, responding without violence. Instead, many members repeated 'God is Great'(ÿßŸÑŸÑ€ÅŸè ÿß⁄©ÿ®ÿ±) and clutched the Qur'an as they went to their death. British soldiers in Peshawar during the demonstrations The exact number of deaths remains controversial‚Äî official figures give 20 deadThe Times 28 April 1930 while nationalist sources claimed several hundred were killed, with many more wounded. Two platoons of a respected British Indian Army regiment, the Royal Garhwal Rifles, refused to board buses that were to take them into Peshawar for anti-riot duty. A British civil servant wrote later that \\"hardly any regiment of the Indian Army won greater glory in the Great War (World War I) than the Garhwal Rifles, and the defection of part of the regiment sent shock waves through India, of apprehension to some, of exultation to others.\\" The NCOs of the two platoons, including one led by Hawaldar Major Chander Singh Garhwal, involved were sentenced to terms of up to eight years imprisonment. The violence continued for six hours. Gene Sharp, who has written a study of nonviolent resistance, describes the scene on that day: > When those in front fell down wounded by the shots, those behind came > forward with their chests bared and exposed themselves to the fire, so much > so that some people got as many as twenty-one bullet wounds in their bodies, > and all the people stood their ground without getting into a panic. . . . > The Anglo-Indian paper of Lahore, which represents the official view, itself > wrote to the effect that the people came forward one after another to face > the firing and when they fell wounded they were dragged back and others came > forward to be shot at. This state of things continued from 11 till 5 o'clock > in the evening. When the number of corpses became too many, the ambulance > cars of the government took them away. Aftermath In Peshawar and the surrounding area, the Khudai Khidmatgar suffered some of the most extreme suffering of the Indian independence movement. Ghaffar Khan later wrote that this was because the British thought a non-violent Pashtun was more dangerous than a violent one. Because of this, the British did everything they could to provoke them into violence, with little effect. The British action against the local Indian population created unrest. This resulted in King George VI (Emperor of India) launching a legal investigation into this matter. The British Commission brought the case forward to Chief Justice Naimatullah Chaudhry, a distinguished Judge of the Lucknow protectorate. King George VI subsequently knighted Naimatullah Chaudhry. Naimatullah personally surveyed the area of massacre and published a 200-page report criticizing the British actions. Olaf Caroe, then secretary to the Chief Commissioner, gave the following report of the event ('Public and Judicial Department. Civil Disobedience Campaign in NWFP. Response to Patel allegations'.

It features an array of mostly American R&B;, soul, rock, and jazz musicians. Concert Ghana, after declaring its Independence on 6 March 1957, had made a variety of efforts to connect with African diasporans, some of whom -- including Maya Angelou, W. E. B. Du Bois and George Padmore -- lived in the West African nation for a time. In the mid-1960s, Angelou approached the government of Kwame Nkrumah and suggested bringing a number of African-American artists to Ghana for the annual independence celebrations. Nkrumah was deposed before action could be taken, but when the American father-son team of Ed Mosk and Tom Mosk approached the Ghana Arts Council in 1970 with an idea for a concert, the Council agreed. A massive 1970 concert by James Brown in Lagos, Nigeria, had prompted the Mosks' confidence in the idea. Of the musicians invited to perform, Wilson Pickett was by far the biggest star in Ghana, where he was known as \\"Soul Brother No. 2.\\" (James Brown was, of course, Soul Brother No. 1.) Organizers also unsuccessfully sought performances by Americans Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Booker T & The MG's, Louis Armstrong and gospel singer Marion Williams. In addition, Fela Kuti was approached, but did not perform. The show, with broadcaster Mike Eghan as MC,Arts Council of Ghana, Soul to Soul, Black Star Square, Accra, Ghana, 6th March, 1971 : with American and Ghanaian soul, gospel and dance groups, featuring Wilson Pickett (and others) : M.C., Mike Eghan, Accra : Moxon Paperbacks, 1971. was held in Black Star Square (now Independence Square) on the Gulf of Guinea and ran for 14 hours, finishing at 6:45 a.m. with a gospel set by The Voices of East Harlem. Several at the show remarked that the band Santana, despite having only one black member, played the most \\"African-sounding\\" music of the night. Some have argued that Santana's merger of Latin rhythms with rock music strongly influenced the development of Afrobeat. Musicians The American artists were mostly African-American and represented a variety of musical styles: * Wilson Pickett * Ike & Tina Turner * Les McCann and Eddie Harris * The Staple Singers * Santana, featuring Willie Bobo on timbale * Roberta Flack * The Voices of East Harlem The concert also featured performances by several Ghanaian acts: * Guy Warren, a.k.a. \\"The Divine Drummer,\\" also known as Kofi Ghanaba, one of the first African musicians to play alongside American jazz musicians * The Damas Choir, perhaps the nation's most prominent vocal group since the 1940s, led by Ishmael Adams * Charlotte Dada (sometimes spelled Dadah or Daddah), best known in the West for her soul cover of The Beatles' song \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" * Kwa Mensah, a pioneer in highlife music and the older palmwine style * The Kumasi Drummers, a group from the Ashanti Region * The Aliens, Ghana's best known rock band, sometimes known as The Psychedelic Aliens or The Magic Aliens * The Anansekromian Zounds, the house band for the Ghana Arts Council Also performing (and seen on the film) were the Nandom Sekpere group from the Northern (now Upper West) region, and the whistle player Nakpi. In addition, Les McCann and Eddie Harris played part of their set with a Ghanaian calabash player and medicine man named Amoah Azangeo. While $50,000 was budgeted for paying the American performers, only $1,000 was set aside for the local musicians. Film The concert was filmed and the Soul to Soul film released in August 1971. It featured extensive excerpts from the concert performances, along with documentary footage of the musicians interacting with local Ghanaians in the days before the show.\\"Soul to Soul (1971)Full Cast & Crew\\", IMDb. The film played in limited release around the world for the next two years but was not a financial success and did not cover the costs of putting on the show. The film was eventually restored thanks to a program by the Grammy Foundation that seeks to preserve important films about music, and it debuted again in February 2004 at an event at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was released on DVD on 24 August 2004. The new release does not include any performances by Roberta Flack, who requested their removal. But it does include a soundtrack album on CD, which features tracks from all the U.S. performers excluding Santana and Flack, plus the Kumasi Drummers, the Damas Choir, and Kwa Mensah. It also includes a new song entitled \\"Soul To Soul (2004)\\" by Earl Thomas.

It was established on 7 June 1974 by Narvesen Kioskkompani's leaders Jens Henrik Nordlie and Finn Skedsmo as well as the lawyer Jens Christian Hauge. Fritt Ord has significant funds and is playing a part in supporting various projects in Norway, as investing in the newspaper Morgenbladet, supporting an encyclopedia (Store Norske Leksikon) and holding a 10.1% ownership in the media group A-Pressen. In addition it awards scholarships to students within media and journalism, awards the Fritt Ord Prize, and supports writing competitions. It has also provided funding for controversial projects, e.g. an upcoming book written by the blogger Fjordman,Geir Ramnefjell, Fritt fram i Fritt Ord?, Dagbladet who calls for the deportation of all Muslims from Europe.Fjordman foreslo nazi-l√∏sning, Dagbladet The organization awards three annual prizes to support freedom of speech;NTB (8 November 2012 Fritt Ords Honn√∏r til Nina Johnsrud Dagbladet, Retrieved 28 June 2013Emil Flat√∏ (20 February 2013): Det skal ikke v√¶re lov √• kalle romfolket ¬´parasitter¬ª og ¬´brunsnegler¬ª Dagbladet, Retrieved 28 June 2013the Press Prizes for Russia and Eastern Europe () the Fritt Ord Award (Norwegian: Fritt Ords pris), the Fritt Ord Honorary Award (Norwegian: Fritt Ords honn√∏r) and the Press Prizes for Russia and Eastern Europe (Norwegian: Pressepriser for Russland og √òst-Europa). Those prizes not to be confused with \\"Ytringsfrihetsprisen\\", the annual Freedom of Expression Prize awarded mostly to international writers by the Norwegian Authors' Union. History The owners of the kiosk chain Narvesen wanted to transform his chain of newspaper and magazine retailers to an institution, and on 1 January 1975 the company was taken over by the newly created foundation Fritt Ord at the same time it merged with the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) company Norsk Spisevognselskap, who offered services within catering to the railway. Fritt Ord got 59% ownership in the newly formed company while NSB got 41% ownership. The dividends from the company made it possible for Fritt Ord to perform a number of tasks related to freedom of expression, including support for the Institute of Journalism and the Freedom of Expression Prize as well as a number of grants to numerous persons and institutions, domestically and internationally. In 1995 NSB sold its shares in Narvesen and the company was listed on Oslo Stock Exchange. As a result of this Fritt Ord reduced its ownership in Narvesen to 34% in 1999 and in 2000 Narvesen was merged with Reitangruppen to form ReitanNarvesen. In 2001 Fritt Ord sold its ownership in the company to the Reitan Family. As a result of the capital freed from the sale of Narvesen, Fritt Ord has acquired holdings in Morgenbladet (30,5%) and A-Pressen (10,1%). Controversies= David Irving controversy in 2008  The organization was criticized by some for obstructing rather than furthering freedom of speech when it threatened the Norwegian Festival of Literature with withdrawing financial support if the British Holocaust denier David Irving was allowed to speak at the festival. In October 2008 Fritt Ord's director, Erik Rudeng, demanded that its logo be removed from the webpages of the Norwegian Festival of Literature because Irving had been invited to give a lecture on his concept of truth at the festival. Irving's invitation was withdrawn only a few days later. Rudeng on his side defended the decision by stating that Fritt Ord only sponsored the literature festival in 2008 and thus it was high time their logo was removed when the program for 2009 was presented. This prompted some commentators to address the paradox of a self-proclaimed \\"free speech\\" organization which involves itself in a campaign to stop a controversial voice like that of David Irving from being heard in Norway. Fjordman controversy It caused controversy when it became known in 2013 that the organization provided funding to the controversial blogger Fjordman (Peder Jensen), who has been characterised as far-right and Islamophobic, for a book Jensen is writing about Anders Behring Breivik and the 2011 Norway attacks. The Labour youth party leader Eskil Pedersen said that Fritt Ord is an organization that provides a platform for \\"gay-haters and racists,\\" referring to both the support for Fjordman and previous support for other controversial causes and individuals.Oda Marie Midtb√∏e (14 June 2013): Eskil Pedersen reagerer kraftig p√• Fjordman-pengest√∏tte VG, retrieved 27 June 2013 ¬´Fjordman¬ª f√•r penger fra Fritt Ord, VG Member of Parliament Snorre Valen accused Fritt Ord of \\"mockery of all those killed and injured\\" in the 2011 Norway attacks, stating that Fritt Ord provides funding to a writer \\"so that he can publish a book about the terrorist he inspired,\\" concluding that Fritt Ord supports \\"extremism.\\"Snorre Valen, Bel√∏nning til ekstremismen, NRK.no Leader of the support group for Breivik's victims, Trond Henry Blattmann, told Dagbladet that Fritt Ord's financial support for Fjordman was \\"unacceptable.\\"\\"‚Äì Forkastelig Fjordman-tildeling\\", Dagbladet, 15 June 2013 p. 52 Fritt Ord's leader Georg Fredrik Rieber-Mohn said the decision to provide grants to Fjordman was very difficult.Jonas S√¶tre (14 June 2013): Fjordman¬ª f√•r Fritt Ord-st√∏tte NRK, retrieved 27 June 2013 The decision was supported by Aftenposten journalist Erik Tornes who argued the grant was a cheap price to pay to get \\"the extremists out of the echochambers\\"Erik Tornes (14 June 2013): √Öpenhetens pris Aftenposten, retrieved 27 June 2013 and by Norway's Minister of Culture Hadia Tajik.Hadia Tajik (25 June 2013): Kommentar: V√•r demokratiske beredskap VG, retrieved November 30, 2019 See also *List of wealthiest foundations ReferencesExternal links *The foundation's website Category:1974 establishments in Norway Category:Foundations based in Norway Category:Mass media companies of Norway Category:Organizations established in 1974 ","title":"Fritt Ord (organization)"},{"id":"4154564","text":"Jem Ward circa 1825 Jem Ward (26 December 1800 ‚Äì 3 April 1884) was an English bare-knuckle boxer. \\"A fine fighter and powerfully built man\\",Biography of Jem Ward he was the English heavyweight champion from 1825 until 1831. He became known for being one of the first boxers to be officially sanctioned for deliberately losing a fight. During his fighting career he was nicknamed \\"The Black Diamond\\". In his retirement he became a successful artist.  Boxing career  Ward first became a professional boxer in 1815, at 15 years of age. He was 5 ft 11 inches (1.80 m) tall, and weighed 12 stone (76 kg). His first fight was victorious against George Robinson and from this point he never lost a match, until he lost to Bill Abbott in 1822. This was the controversial bout that wrecked Ward's early professional career. He was heard to call to his opponent \\"Now, Bill, look sharp, hit me and I‚Äôll go down.\\" He was promptly hit and fell to the ground. Abbott was considered to be an inferior boxer to Ward, and suspicions were immediately aroused. The Pugilistic Society, the body which then governed boxing and enforced the London Prize Ring rules, held an inquiry. Eventually after confessing he had received a ¬£100 bribe to lose, Ward was banned from fighting in any contest governed by the Society. In this era boxing was an object of heavy betting, by members of all strata of society, including the sons of King George III. The incident has left Ward's reputation with a lasting stigma.Cyberboxing and still today causes some to be of the opinion that Ward should not have been admitted to the Boxing hall of Fame 120 years after his death Ward was the elder brother of the boxer Nick Ward, who also had a reputation for using unfair tactics. Nick Ward, however, did not achieve the same success as his brother in the ring.Nick Ward Deprived of his living Ward was reduced to travelling the country fighting under assumed names at fairs or in any chance ungoverned brawl where he could possibly pick up a prize. Once early in 1823 when attending a bout as a spectator, he was called upon to enter the ring, when the planned fight ended prematurely, and someone was needed to provide entertainment to keep the crowd present and spending money. He fought Ned Baldwin and defeated him, but the match was void due to his ban. Under the pseudonym Sawney Wilson and claiming to be an inexperienced boy, he beat the champion Joe Rickens, thus making the bookmakers a fortune. Later in 1823, the Pugilistic Society decided to re- allow him to enter their fights. After his reinstatement, he lost his first fight to Josh Hudson. In 1825, anxious for publicity and thus money, he challenged and fought the reigning heavyweight champion Tom Cannon. This proved to be the very high-profile match Ward needed, with Cannon seconded by two previous champions Tom Spring and Tom Cribb, names guaranteed to draw the crowds. The match took place on 19 July 1825 at Stanfield Park on a very hot day with the temperature reputedly over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.A clown's log. It took Ward just over 10 minutes to dispatch Cannon and become the new English champion.East Side Boxing Painting by Jem Ward of the fight for the \\"Championship of England and America\\" between Thomas Sayers and John C. Heenan in 1860. Following the victory Ward led a life of ease and dissipation for two years, having bought a public house. In 1827 he was finally forced by public opinion to return to the ring, and accept a challenge from Peter Crawley. He was defeated by Crawley but quickly reclaimed the title when Crawley retired immediately after their match. Ward's last match was in 1831. On 12 July, he fought his last fight against the Irish champion, Simon Byrne. After an hour and seventeen minutes Ward was victorious, and retained his heavyweight title until his retirement in 1831. His 1831 retirement was forced. Ward had received criticism for refusing to face the younger challenger, James Burke, and rather than fight he retired and relinquished his title. However he did not relinquish to Burke his championship belt, when pressed he agreed to hand it over to the victor of Burke's match against his last adversary Simon Byrne in 1833. However, Ward refused to hand over the belt when Burke beat Byrne who Ward supported. Byrne, who had been knocked unconscious died three days later after the fight, Burke was tried and acquitted of his murder, but Ward still refused to part with the championship belt.Cyberboxing He finally handed the belt over to William ‚ÄòBendigo‚Äô Thompson at the Queen‚Äôs Theatre in Liverpool following the latter's defeat of Burke in 1839.East Side Boxing.

As a musician he played both the violin and flute, and sang in concerts.

An immigrant to Australia, Kraljeviƒá joined the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (HRB) upon his arrival there in 1967. During his return to Yugoslavia in January 1992 he was appointed by Dobroslav Paraga, leader of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), as leader of the HOS in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Bosnian War he advocated a Croat‚ÄìBosniak alliance, a view that ran counter to those of the Croatian government led by Croatian president Franjo Tuƒëman and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. He denounced attempts by Mate Boban, president of the self-proclaimed Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, president of the self- proclaimed Republika Srpska, to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina and was appointed by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegoviƒá as a member of Staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), shortly before his assassination by Croatian Defence Council (HVO) soldiers under the command of Mladen Naletiliƒá. Early life Bla≈æ Kraljeviƒá was born on 17 September 1947 in the village of Lisice in the municipality of Ljubu≈°ki, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1967, at the age of 19, he migrated to Australia where he was recruited by Sreƒáko Rover into the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (HRB), a pro-Usta≈°e group established in the mid-1950s. Kraljeviƒá remained in Australia until 1990 when he returned to Yugoslavia to help fight for Croatian independence. Bosnian War Flag of the Croatian Defence Forces. In 1990 and 1991, Serbs in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina had proclaimed a number of \\"Serbian Autonomous Regions\\" with the intent of later unifying them to create a Greater Serbia. Serbs used the well equipped Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in defending these territories. As early as September‚ÄìOctober 1990, the JNA had begun arming Bosnian Serbs and organizing them into militias. By March 1991, the JNA had distributed an estimated 51,900 firearms to Serb paramilitaries and 23,298 firearms to Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). The Croatian government began arming Croats in the Herzegovina region in 1991 and in the start of 1992, expecting that the Serbs would spread the war into Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also helped arm the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) community. From July 1991 to January 1992, the JNA and Serb paramilitaries used Bosnian territory to wage attacks on Croatia. On 25 March 1991, Franjo Tuƒëman met with Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in Karaƒëorƒëevo, reportedly to discuss partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In June, the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) was formed in Croatia by the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP). In November, the autonomous Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia (HZ-HB) was established, it claimed that it did not aim to secede and that it would serve a \\"legal basis for local self-administration\\". It vowed to respect the Bosnian government under the condition that Bosnia and Herzegovina was independent of \\"the former and every kind of future Yugoslavia.\\" In December, Tuƒëman, in a conversation with Bosnian Croat leaders, said that \\"from the perspective of sovereignty, Bosnia-Herzegovina has no prospects\\" and recommended that Croatian policy \\"support for the sovereignty [of Bosnia and Herzegovina] until such time as it no longer suits Croatia.\\" That same month HOS was disbanded by the Croatian government. On 3 January 1992, Dobroslav Paraga, leader of the HSP, appointed Kraljeviƒá as leader of the HOS in Bosnia and Herzegovina and established its main headquarters in Ljubu≈°ki. It \\"supported Bosnian territorial integrity much more consistently and sincerely than the HVO\\" which supported a partition of its territory. It was more accepting of Bosniaks in its ranks than the HVO and consisted of 5,000 volunteers that included Bosnian Croats, Bosniaks, and foreign volunteers. He played an influential role and advocated a Croat‚ÄìBosniak alliance for a united Bosnia and Herzegovina. His views ran counter to those of the Croatian government and he was seen by Tuƒëman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) as an obstacle to their plans for a Croat‚ÄìBosniak War. Media in Croatia, closely associated with Croatian defense minister Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, claimed that HOS was in fact \\"MOS\\", the \\"Muslim Defence Force\\", and that the Bosniaks were prepared, through HOS, to backstab the Croats. Upon entrance in the war, Kraljeviƒá had declared that: In April 1992, the siege of Sarajevo began, by which time the Bosnian Serb-formed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) controlled 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 8 April, Bosnian Croats were organized into the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). A sizable number of Bosniaks also joined. On 15 April 1992, the multi-ethnic Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) was formed, with slightly over two-thirds of troops consisting of Bosniaks and almost one-third of Croats and Serbs. In the winter Bosniaks began leaving the HVO and joining the ARBiH which also began receiving supplies from Croatia. In May, HVO Major General Ante Roso declared that the only \\"legal military force\\" in HZ-HB was the HVO and that \\"all orders from the TO [Territorial Defense] command [of Bosnia and Herzegovina] are invalid, and are to be considered illegal on this territory\\". On 9 May 1992, Boban, Josip Manoliƒá, Tuƒëman's aide and previously the Croatian Prime Minister, and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, president of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, secretly met in Graz and formed an agreement on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Graz agreement. Kraljeviƒá denounced the agreement stating \\"we implore all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially Croats and Bosniaks, not to take into account any statements or agreements between Mate Boban and Radovan Karad≈æiƒá. Neither speaks in the name of Croats and Bosniaks. They do not represent what the Croats and Bosniaks want. ... HOS and the TO are defending, and will defend, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\" Kraljeviƒá commented on the internal divisions of Croats and closed stating \\"We will get rid of the people with a dark past and suspicious present. [...] We will send them home but need to keep an eye on them as our destiny is at stake. We have a chance, but just this one.\\" Assassination Since the outset of the Bosnian War, HOS and HVO competed for power and influence. HOS played an important role in the liberation of Mostar, ƒåapljina, Neum and Stolac. By the end of July 1992, within one day about 700 HVO members joined the ranks of HOS in ƒåapljina. Similar crossings occurred in Tomislavgrad, Livno and Mostar. In the summer of 1992, the HVO started to purge its Bosniak members. At the same time armed incidents started to occur among Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina between the HVO and the HOS. The HOS was loyal to the Bosnian government and accepted subordination to the Staff of the ARBiH of which Kraljeviƒá was appointed a member. On 9 August, Kraljeviƒá and eight of his staff were assassinated by HVO soldiers under the command of Mladen Naletiliƒá, who supported a split between Croats and Bosniaks, after Kraljeviƒá's HOS attacked the VRS near Trebinje. According to Manoliƒá the order to kill Kraljeviƒá was given by ≈†u≈°ak and approved by Tuƒëman. Bo≈æidar Vuƒçureviƒá, the war-time mayor of Trebinje, stated he safeguarded records showing it was a \\"task\\" to be carried out by SDS and HDZ figures. The HOS's advance into eastern Herzegovina and occupation of Trebinje angered Boban who had affirmed to Karad≈æiƒá that Croat forces were uninterested in the region. The Kru≈°evo General Staff of HVO claimed that two vehicles with HOS members refused to stop at a police checkpoint and that HOS members first opened fire, killing HVO lieutenant ≈Ωivko Boduliƒá. Kraljeviƒá's body and those of the eight other HOS soldiers were rushed to Split for autopsies before an investigation began and the investigating judge from Mostar only came to the scene a day later. After his death, Croatian media claimed Kraljeviƒá was an agent of the UDBA, Yugoslav secret police, who had returned from Australia to harm the interests of Bosnian Croats. Bosnian officials suspected that Tuƒëman's government was involved. The HOS was disbanded, leaving the HVO as the only Croat force. The HOS was absorbed by the HVO and the ARBiH at the beginning of the Croat-Bosniak War. In 1996, at the insistence of ≈†u≈°ak, Tuƒëman posthumously awarded Kraljeviƒá the Order of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan.

The society consists of around 30 fiddlers, 2 cellists and currently 2 double bassists. They play at many concerts throughout the year and also attend the Kirriemuir Fiddle Festival every November, which, for the last two years running, they have won the large group competition and last year won the quartet competition. Aims The aims of the society are as follows; To foster the playing of Scottish fiddle music by young people. To encourage an interest in Scottish music and dance. To give public performances. To take part in musical competitions and displays. To participate in tours or special events related to these aims. History As part of the movement to preserve and develop Scottish traditional fiddle playing the Lothian Schools Strathspey and Reel Society was formed in 1983 by its conductor Yla Steven. Its membership is drawn from pupils attending schools in Lothian who meet weekly to rehearse their skills. The current membership is around 40. In 1984 the group went to Munich representing the Lothian Region in the celebrations which marked the 30th anniversary of the twinning of the two cities, Edinburgh and Munich. In 1985 they represented Lothian Region again, this time at the Scottish Schools Prom Concert in the Usher Hall, Edinburgh. This concert was presented to commemorate European Music Year and was broadcast on television by BBC Scotland. For several years now the Lothian Schools Strathspey and Reel Society has competed at the Kirrimuir Fiddle Festival, one of the top festivals of its kind in Scotland, and many of its members past and present have featured in the prize list for both solo and group performances. 2000 was a particularly successful year - winning the orchestra competition. However, the orchestra has won this 3 times, and is now recognised as one of the top strathspey and reel societies in Scotland. The Lothian Schools Strathspey and Reel Society has hosted many \\"Fiddlers' Rallies\\" all over Scotland - the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow, the Whitehall theatre, Dundee, and most frequently in Falkirk Town Hall where there is a Youth Music Festival at Easter time.

They started in Edmonton - played in the Mall, then Red Deer for their Highland Games, Banff for Canada Day - Banff Springs Hotel!, and finally Calgary where they marched in the Stampede Parade and performed on the Centennial Stage. 1993 saw another breakthrough in their impressive record when they played nightly for three and a half weeks for the Scottish Country Dancers at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. Foreign travel was on the agenda again in 1994. This time it was a tour of the Argentine where they were guests of St. Andrew's College, Buenos Aires. In 1996 the L.S.S.R.S. were the fiddle orchestra who took part in the Robert Burns Spectacular Concert in Glasgow marking the bi-centenary of the poet's death. In 1998 the L.S.S.R.S. made a return visit to Canada playing this time in Vancouver, Creston, Calgary, Banff, Medicine Hat, Toronto and also Ann Arbor in Michigan, United States. In 1999 and 2000 the L.S.S.R.S. acted as \\"hosts\\" to the Fiddlers Philharmonic from Ann Arbor and New Tradition from Shetland. In 2000 they also took part in the Spirit of Youth Concert in Falkirk Town Hall. 2001 saw the Spirit of Youth Concert move to the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall - this time it was televised and broadcast in 2002. Between them these concerts have raised over ¬£50,000 for CHAS (Child Hospice Association of Scotland).

The highway runs through Charlestown between two intersections with MD 7 in southwestern Cecil County. MD 267, which follows the path of the Old Post Road between Baltimore and Philadelphia, was constructed as a modern highway along that main line in 1915. The highway was bypassed by what is now MD 7 in 1921 to avoid a pair of dangerous bridges across what is now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Those two bridges and adjacent sections of MD 267 were replaced west and east of Charlestown in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, respectively. Route description View west along MD 267 at MD 7 just east of Charlestown MD 267 begins at an intersection with MD 7 (Philadelphia Road) west of Charlestown. The state highway heads east as two-lane undivided Baltimore Street, which immediately crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and enters the town of Charlestown. After passing Carpenters Point Road, MD 267 enters the Charlestown Historic District. After passing Charlestown Elementary School, the state highway turns north onto Cecil Street and crosses Red Rum Run. The state highway becomes Market Street after making a right-angle turn to the east and passes the Indian Queen Tavern and Black's Store, then turns north again onto Bladen Street. After crossing Peddlers Run Creek, leaving the historic district, and leaving the town limits, MD 267 crosses over the railroad tracks again and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 7 east of Charlestown. History MD 267 traces the path of the Old Post Road between Baltimore and Philadelphia blazed during the 18th century, during which Charlestown was the county seat of Cecil County. The Post Road from Perryville to Elkton was part of the state road system proposed by the State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway through Charlestown was constructed as a macadam road in 1915. The highway through Charlestown was bypassed when the Charlestown Cut-Off (later U.S. Route 40, now MD 7) was constructed in 1921, eliminating two dangerous bridges across the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) from the course of the main highway. The western bridge, named Weber's Bridge or Weavers Bridge, crossed over the railroad perpendicularly east of the current crossing and featured a sharp curve on the south side of the tracks and an intersection with MD 7 immediately to the north. This bridge was reconstructed in 1951. The eastern bridge, named Heisler's Bridge, also crossed the railroad perpendicularly east of the current crossing and had a right-angle turn immediately to the south of the crossing near Clearview Avenue. MD 267 was relocated and Weber's Bridge was replaced in 1966 and 1967. The bypassed piece of highway became MD 913. Heisler's Bridge was replaced and the adjacent state highway relocated between 1973 and 1975. A portion of the bypassed highway east of Charlestown was conveyed from the state to the adjacent property owners in 1974.

Siri did not associate himself with this idea, which is held by a small minority of traditionalist Catholics. Its exponents claim that a prolonged emission of white smoke on the first day of balloting at the conclave indicated the election of Siri, but that threats applied from outside the conclave caused his election to be reversed, allowing Pope John XXIII to be elected two days later. The source of the threats has been identified variously as Freemasons and agents of the Soviet Union. Adherents of the Siri thesis say that the election of John XXIII was invalid. They regard him and his successors as imposters and antipopes. 1958 conclave On 25 October 1958, 51 cardinals entered the papal conclave, which was held to elect a successor to Pope Pius XII. Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, then 52 years old, was considered a strong candidate in the election. Siri was viewed then, and throughout his life, as staunchly conservative. At 11:53a.m. on the morning of 26 October, the first day of balloting, white smoke was seen coming from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, a traditional signal to the crowds in the square outside that a pope has been elected. It was followed after a few minutes by black smoke. The Italian radio network and the Italian news agency had to retract their initial reports that a pope had been elected. Something similar happened in the afternoon at 5:53p.m. when the smoke again appeared white. At 6p.m., after the smoke had continued white for several minutes, Vatican Radio told the world: \\"The smoke is white... There is absolutely no doubt. A Pope has been elected.\\"The Tablet. 1 November 1958. Quoted in After about half an hour, the smoke turned black, indicating that there was no result. Vatican Radio corrected its report. The New York Times said that \\"The crowd lingered for more than a half hour, apparently hoping against hope that a new Pope would appear.\\" The paper reported that problems getting the straw to catch fire likely caused the morning‚Äôs problem and said \\"The second signal was misunderstood because it came well after nightfall. The smoke was lighted from below by a spotlight, which made black appear white.\\" The official responsible for arrangements outside the conclave notified the cardinals that the colour of the smoke had been misread and provided them with \\"smoke torches from a fireworks factory\\". The third day's four ballots again failed to select a pope and there was no confusion about the colour of the smoke. On the afternoon of the next day, 28 October, white smoke signalled the election of a pope. On their eleventh ballot the conclave had elected Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, who took the name John XXIII. While Siri was considered a favourite for election before the conclave, he did not feature in the early voting, and ultimately was never in the running. He was thought too young at 52; a long pontificate would have been anticipated, and this was felt to be undesirable because a long pontificate would have prevented other cardinals who wanted to be elected pope from having the chance of being elected. History of the thesis Sometime in the late 1980s, an American traditionalist Catholic named Gary Giuffre began to expound the belief that Siri was the true pope, and that he was being held against his will in Rome. According to Giuffre and supporters of the theory, the white smoke that was seen on 26 October 1958 did indeed mean that a pope had been elected, and that pope was Siri, but he was forced to surrender the papacy in the face of dire threats from outside the conclave. Giuffre speculates the main threat was that Rome would be destroyed with a thermonuclear weapon, effectively wiping out the entire hierarchy of the Church in one blow. With the electors unsure of how to proceed, Roncalli, who they claim was a Freemason, supposedly offered himself as a compromise with the promise that he would call a synod soon after his election to regularize the unusual situation. It is claimed Roncalli purposely chose the same name as Antipope John XXIII as an acknowledgment of his irregular status. Roncalli was promptly elected as John XXIII instead of Siri. A similar process is said to have occurred at the 1963 conclave that followed John XXIII's death. There again white smoke was seen indicating that Siri had been elected, and again it turned black and, under threats from outside the conclave, a different cardinal was elected, Giovanni Montini, who took the name Paul VI. During this conclave, it was alleged that the threats of terrible retribution if Siri were elected were passed into the conclave by the B'nai B'rith, working on behalf of a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy. The assertion that Siri's 1963 election had been set aside after the intervention of the B'nai B'rith was contained in an article written in 1986 by Louis Hubert Remy in a French publication, ', and translated into English in 1987 for Dan Jones's newsletter, The Sangre de Cristo Newsnotes.. Translated into English by Heidi Hagen for \\"The Sangre de Cristo Newsnotes\\" ‚Äì No. 55 ‚Äì December 1987. That article made no mention of the 1958 conclave. Malachi Martin, in his apocalyptic 1990 book The Keys of This Blood, said that in the 1963 conclave Siri received sufficient votes for election, but refused it. The reason, according to Martin, was that he believed that \\"only thus could foreseen possibilities of grave danger be avoided‚Äîbut whether harm to the Church, his family, or to him personally, is not clear.\\" Siri's refusal, he says, followed a conversation on the subject of Siri's candidacy between a member of the conclave and somebody outside it, who was \\"an emissary of an internationally based organisation\\". In a 1997 interview on the radio programme Steel on Steel, hosted by John Loefller, Martin claimed that Siri had also obtained a majority of votes in the first 1978 conclave, but that he had received a written note after his election threatening him and his family with death should he accept.. Followers of the \\"Siri thesis\\" recognize him as \\"Gregory XVII\\", and also refer to him as \\"the Red Pope\\". Paul L. Williams, in a 2003 book entitled The Vatican Exposed, claimed that US State Department documents confirmed that Siri had been elected pope in 1958 as Gregory XVII. According to Williams, however, the election was quashed not by a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, but by fear of the Soviet Union. Roncalli, he claims, was known as the \\"pink priest\\" because of his ties with both the French and Italian Communist parties, while Siri was \\"rabidly anti-Communist\\". Siri received the requisite number of votes on the third ballot, and was elected as Gregory XVII, but \\"the French cardinals annulled the results, claiming that the election would cause widespread riots and the assassination of several prominent bishops behind the Iron Curtain.\\" It was then decided to elect Cardinal Federico Tedeschini, but as he was too ill, Roncalli was elected instead.Williams (2009), p. 92. Williams cited \\"Department of State secret dispatch, 'John XXIII,' issue date: November 20, 1958, declassified: November 11, 1974\\" and \\"Department of State secret file, 'Cardinal Siri,' issue date: April 10, 1961, declassified: February 28, 1994\\" in support of his claims. In subsequent editions, however, the references were changed to simply \\"F.B.I. source\\".Williams (2009), p. 239 Significance Traditionalist Catholics oppose the liturgical changes and \\"modernist\\" theological positions resulting from the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), which many of them see as a \\"heretical\\" council. Sedevacantists are a minority group within traditionalist Catholicism, who maintain that none of the popes from John XXIII (who called the council) onward were true popes, and that therefore the papal seat is vacant (). The idea that John XXIII and Paul VI were not true popes, but antipopes, is neatly explained by the Siri thesis: if Siri was elected in 1958, then the election of John, and therefore of all his successors, was invalid. The Catholic magazine Inside the Vatican has referred to adherents of the Siri thesis as \\"sede impeditists\\", meaning that they believe there was a true pope, but that he was \\"impeded\\" by outside forces from taking his office. The magazine estimated that the thesis was believed \\"by hundreds, perhaps thousands of people around the world\\". Siri's later career Siri is not recorded as ever having made reference to the \\"Siri thesis\\", nor was there any mention of it in his New York Times obituary, in the biography written by Raimondo Spiazzi, or in a speech given by Giulio Andreotti on the centenary of Siri's birth in 2006. He was appointed president of the Italian Episcopal Conference by John XXIII in 1959, and remained in the post under Paul VI until 1964. He sat on the Board of Presidency of the Second Vatican Council from 1963 until its close in 1965. He was a candidate for pope‚Äîstill representing the conservatives‚Äîin the 1978 conclave that followed the death of Paul VI, where he is thought to have led in the early ballots before being overtaken by Albino Luciani (John Paul I), and again two months later in the October 1978 conclave, where he is also thought to have come within a few votes of election. He was Archbishop of Genoa from 1946 to 1987, and at the time of his retirement he was \\"the last remaining active cardinal named by Pope Pius XII.\\" References Category:Conspiracy theories involving religion Category:Sedevacantism ","title":"Siri thesis"},{"id":"4154616","text":"Chicama is a town in Northern Peru, capital of the district of Chicama of Ascope Province in the region La Libertad.

He is best known as a member of Badfinger, the most successful of the acts he performed with. Molland is the last surviving member from the band's classic line-up. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Career Originally a member of several rock groups around Liverpool, such as The Assassins and The Profiles, Molland began his recording career in 1965 when he joined The Masterminds. This group released a single on Immediate Records IM 005, consisting of a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"She Belongs to Me\\" backed with a band original, \\"Taken My Love\\". After this the group disbanded and Molland joined the backing group of The Merseys. Although never recording with them, he did accompany them on tour. Molland's recording career began in earnest in 1967 when he joined Gary Walker (formerly of the Walker Brothers) for the group 'Gary Walker & The Rain'. The Rain released several singles, an EP, and an album on the Polydor and Philips labels in the UK and Japan between 1967 and 1969. Titled #1, the album featured four Molland compositions and was especially well received in Japan,Matovina, Dan. Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger. Francis Glover Books but a lack of success in their UK homebase caused the band to disband by 1969. In November 1969, Molland auditioned for The Iveys and was hired. The Iveys were a conspicuous recording group at the time of Apple Records (a label launched by The Beatles). The Iveys changed their name to \\"Badfinger\\" after dismissing original bassist Ron Griffiths, moving guitarist Tommy Evans to bass, and starting Molland as guitarist. The band enjoyed an early string of successful singles and albums for the next couple of years. During Molland's association with Apple, he made guest appearances on two George Harrison albums, All Things Must Pass and The Concert For Bangla Desh, and the John Lennon album, Imagine. Molland left Badfinger in late 1974 due to disagreements over management. In 1975, he joined with Jerry Shirley (formerly of Humble Pie) and formed a group called Natural Gas. The band released the LP Natural Gas on Private Stock Records in 1976, and enjoyed a successful tour with Peter Frampton the following year. According to Molland, a general lack of organisation led to the band's demise late in 1977. Molland and former Badfinger bandmate Tom Evans recorded two albums under the Badfinger name, Airwaves in 1978, and Say No More in 1981. He and Evans split after Say No More and the two performed in rival touring Badfinger bands until Evans' suicide in 1983. Molland's career since 1983 has been with various rock groups and duos, and performing tours under the Badfinger name or as \\"Joey Molland's Badfinger\\". Earlier versions of these groups sometimes included original Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins. Molland was instrumental in releasing a 1974 live recording of Badfinger on Rykodisc in 1991, called Day After Day: Live, which received mixed critical reactions due to overdubbing and a rearranged track order. Molland's solo recordings have been well received. His first, After The Pearl, was released in 1984 on Earthtone Records. His second, The Pilgrim, was released in 1992 on Rykodisc. His third, This Way Up, was independently released in 2001. His most current album, Return To Memphis, was released on 13 December 2013 .OEY MOLLAND ‚Äì Return To Memphis Review by BY LEE ZIMMERMAN on Blurt Magazine Online. Accessed via the internet 18 October 2016 Molland went back into the studio in 2015 with members of 10,000 Maniacs (Ladies First) to release a new version on the classic song, \\"Sweet Tuesday Morning\\" from Badfinger's 1972 album Straight Up. The collaboration, in partnership with HAIL! Fredonia Records of the State University of New York at Fredonia has aimed to \\"expand support to those in need of help and increase community empowerment\\" with proceeds supporting global non-for-profit organization, WhyHunger. In late 2019 Molland toured with Todd Rundgren, Jason Scheff, Micky Dolenz and Christopher Cross in celebration of The Beatles White Album on the \\"It Was Fifty Years Ago Today ‚Äì A Tribute to the Beatles‚Äô White Album\\". Molland performed the Badfinger songs Baby Blue and No Matter What. Personal life Molland lives in Minnesota and has two grown children, Joseph Charles III and Shaun.

This book is about a young child named Julie who grows from 7 to 17 years old with her aunt Cordelia and uncle Haskell in the country. Plot summary When seven-year-old Julie's mother dies, she is sent to live with her Aunt Cordelia, an unmarried schoolteacher who lives in a large house several miles outside town. Her uncle Haskell lives in a converted carriage house behind the main house. Haskell is an alcoholic who, like his niece, aspires to be a writer (although he never produces a manuscript). Julie's brother Chris goes to boarding school, leaving her alone with Aunt Cordelia. At first, grief- stricken Julie finds Aunt Cordelia stern and strict, but as she grows to young adulthood she comes to love her and to see her house as home. She becomes so attached to her that even when she has the chance to move back with her father, who remarries, she declines. The story follows Julie from the age of seven to seventeen, from elementary school through her high-school graduation, and documents the ordinary events in a child's life: the cruelty of children, jealousy, schoolwork trouble, and first love. Julie also encounters problems in the lives of the adults around her, including alcoholism and mental illness (dementia). Reception Kirkus Reviews said of Up a Road Slowly: \\"The author is adept at distinguishing the genuine from the spurious: Julie is a genuine character, and girls who go up the road with her will share in her growing up.\\" In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author John Rowe Townsend wrote, \\"Though not without faults, Julie seems at last just a little too good to be true, and so does the adult world in which she has won her place. That it is not our world is evident, and is not a just cause for complaint; but was the world ever quite like that?\\" References Category:1966 American novels Category:1966 children's books Category:American children's novels Category:Newbery Medal- winning works Category:Novels about orphans ","title":"Up a Road Slowly"},{"id":"4154681","text":"William Abraham (1840 ‚Äì 2 August 1915) was an Irish Member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom House of Commons. He was born in Limerick. Although a Protestant in religion (a Congregationalist), he became active in Irish Nationalist politics. He was involved in the Irish Land League in 1881 and was at one stage imprisoned as a political suspect. He served as Chairman of Limerick Board of Guardians (who administered the Poor Law in their district) 1882‚Äì1883 and 1885‚Äì1886. Abraham represented three constituencies at the Palace of Westminster. He was elected unopposed as MP for West Limerick at the 1885 general election as a Nationalist supporter of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and served until he retired in 1892. When the Party split over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell in December 1890 he went with the Anti- Parnell majority, and was in fact the proposer of the vote of no confidence in Parnell as leader in the proceedings in Committee Room 15. In 1893, he was elected unopposed as an Anti-Parnellite Nationalist at a by-election for North-East Cork, succeeding Michael Davitt, and sat until he was defeated in the January 1910 general election by the dissident Nationalist William O'Brien, by the wide margin of 2,984 votes to 1,510. He was unopposed at the by-election for Dublin Harbour in June 1910, and won comfortably against an O'Brienite Nationalist in the same seat in the general election of December 1910. He represented Dublin Harbour until his death in 1915. According to the Irish Independent, he was assiduous in his duties at Westminster, and spoke at one time or another in every constituency in Great Britain, including Orkney and Shetland. He was a Treasurer of his party, and a prominent member of the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons. However, in Patrick Maume's view (1999, p. 223), his age and lack of local contacts made him ineffective in his final role as a Dublin M.P.

Norseng Gulating (Store norske leksikon) The practice of periodic regional assemblies predates recorded history, and was firmly established at the time of the unification of Norway into a single kingdom (900‚Äì1030). These assemblies or lag√æings were not democratic, but did not merely serve elites either. They functioned as judicial and legislative bodies, resolving disputes and establishing laws. Gula√æing, along with Norway's three other ancient regional assemblies, the Borgarting, Eidsivating, and Frostating, were joined into a single jurisdiction during the late 13th century, when King Magnus the Lawmender had the existing body of law put into writing (1263‚Äì1280). They provided the institutional and legal framework for subsequent legislative and judicial bodies, and remain in operation today as superior regional courts. History The Gula√æing was an annual parliamentary assembly which took place in Gulen, on the west coast of Norway north of Bergen, from approximately 900 to 1300 AD and was one of the oldest and largest parliamentary assemblies in medieval Norway. The Gulatinget Millennium Site is a symbol of the history of this Norwegian representative form of parliament, with traditions reaching over a thousand years back in time. Initially farmers from Western Norway met at Gulen to discuss political matters, things like taxation, the building of roads and churches, and military service. The assembly also passed judgments in civil disputes and criminal cases. Special legislation, Gulatingslova (the Gula√æing law), was drafted to aid the discussions. A fairly complete manuscript of the legislation from around 1250 has survived, Codex Ranzovianus (E don. var. 137 4to at the Danish Royal Library); however, the text represents all the laws adopted and amended by the farmers at the thing over several centuries.Per G. Norseng Gulatingsloven (Store norske leksikon) The assembly site was established early in the 10th century and the original legislative area covered the regions of Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. Initially the Gula√æing was an 'allthing' or common assembly, where all free farmers had the right to participate. Snorri Sturlason‚Äôs Heimskringla recounts that H√•kon the Good (935‚Äì961) took an active part in the parliamentary assemblies at Gulen, and under his rule the regions of Rogaland, Agder and Sunnm√∏re were brought into the area covered by the thing, with Valdres and Hallingdal also being incorporated later. The practice of periodic regional assemblies of leading men predates recorded history, and was firmly established at the time of the unification of Norway into a single kingdom (900‚Äì1030). These assemblies or lag√æings, functioned as judicial and legislative bodies, resolving disputes and establishing laws. The Gula√æing received delegates from Lyng√∏r in the south to north of √Ölesund, and its laws were observed from the eastern inland valleys of Valdres and Hallingdal to the Faroe Islands in the west.Jon Gisle Lagting (Store norske leksikon) The Gula√æing served as the model for the establishment of the legislative assemblies of Iceland (the Althing) and of the Faeroe Islands (the L√∏gting), areas settled by people from western Norway. While the Gulating was not a democratic assembly in the modern sense of an elected body, it effectively represented the interests of a large number of people rather than a small elite. The laws were typically crafted as social contracts. ¬ß35 for instance states, \\"None of us shall take goods from others, or take the law into our own hands\\" (Robbestad, 1969). The laws nevertheless applied for every person inside the \\"law area\\" Gula√æingsl«´g. If a stranger stole from a Gula√æingsman, that was also in breach of the laws, but the law set no limits to how he could be punished. Gula√æing, along with Norway's three other ancient regional assemblies, the Borgarting, Eidsivating, and Frostating, were joined into a single jurisdiction during the late Viking Age, and King Magnus the Lawmender had the existing body of law put into writing (1263‚Äì1280). They provided the institutional and legal framework for subsequent legislative and judicial bodies, and remain in operation today as superior regional courts.Jon Gisle Borgarting (Store norske leksikon) The assembly site was selected as the millennium site for Sogn og Fjordane county. Judgments Violence was dealt with by fines, which were imposed not only on the murderer, but also on his relatives‚Äîa practice that distinguishes Old Norse law from the Roman practice of holding only the individual responsible. Homicide of an heir to a property, according to Gula√æing law ¬ß218-228, is punished by a collective fee of 189 cattle, where each responsible party's share is spelled out in detail. If we assume a fair price of $2,000 per bull or cow, that translates into modern money (United States dollars) approximately as follows: :*Murderer's fine: $200,000 :*Murderer's brother: $72,200 :*Murderer's paternal cousin: $39,000 :*Murderer's paternal uncle: $20,000 More remote relatives were fined from $300 to $8,800. Murder was expensive, and so was personal physical injury. The cost to the convicted party's extended family of chopping off another's arm or a leg, for instance, was fixed at the equivalent of $186,000; a thumb, $19,200.

Historically it was the site of court and assembly for the eastern parts of Norway.Eidsivating (Store norske leksikon) Summary Traditionally Eidsivating was the court for the population around Lake Mj√∏sa. Eidsivating was originally situated at √Öker g√•rd, the seat of Vang in Hedmark county, Norway. When Norway was united as a kingdom, the first lagtings were constituted as superior regional assemblies, Eidsivating being one of them. These were representative assemblies at which delegates from the various districts in each region met to award legal judgments and pass laws (Eidsivatingloven). Later, during the time of St. Olav, the court was moved to Eidsvold. The jurisdiction of the court was then extended to include Romerike and Hadeland as well as Hedmark. Later √òsterdalen and Gudbrandsdalen were also included.√Öker g√•rd (Store norske leksikon) Eidsivatingloven (Store norske leksikon) The ancient regional assemblies ‚Äì Frostating, Gulating, Eidsivating and Borgarting ‚Äì were eventually joined into a single jurisdiction. King Magnus Lagab√∏te had the existing body of law put into writing (1263‚Äì1280). In 1274, Magnus promulgated the new national law (Magnus Lagab√∏tes landslov), a unified code of laws to apply for the Kingdom of Norway, including the Faroe islands and Shetland. This compilation of the codified Gulating laws (Gulatingsloven) applied throughout the realm was exceptional for its time. This code remained in force until Frederik III, king of the Dano-Norwegian personal union, promulgated absolute monarchy in 1660. Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld prepared a document which would form the King's Law (Kongeloven) dated 14 November 1665. This was codified in the King Act of 1665 which functioned as the constitution of the Union of Denmark-Norway until 1814.

Description The escorting service is offered to anyone who does not feel capable of driving due to alcohol consumption, fatigue, or any reason. Although it is a free service, donations are accepted. Each year during the holiday season, an advertising campaign reminds the public to use the service if necessary. When needing a ride, the client first calls the organization. The client must have his/her own car‚Äîit is not a taxi service. An escort team of three volunteers arrives. One volunteer, the 'escort driver', uses his or her own car to drive the other two volunteers to the client's location. The 'designated driver' volunteer then drives the client home in the client's own car. The third volunteer is the 'navigator', and drives with the designated driver and client, collecting any donation that the client should want to make, giving the client a receipt, and making conversation with the client so the client does not bother the driver. When the ride is over, the escort driver picks up the designated driver and the navigator. Originally donations went to the swimming team of Universit√© Laval, but the organization became so successful that today donations go to 150 organizations. The costs of Operation Nez Rouge are covered by sponsors (such as insurance companies.) History Operation Nez Rouge was started in 1984 in Quebec City by Jean-Marie De Koninck, who had two goals. He wanted to finance Universit√© Laval's swimming team and he wanted to do something to fight driving under the influence. He knew that drivers leaving bars refused taxis to bring them home when intoxicated, not because of the cost, but because they wanted to have their own cars the next day. Thus came the idea to simply offer an escorting service. The service was used 1,205,894 times between 1984 and 2004. The service was the setting of the 2003 romantic comedy film Red Nose (Nez rouge).\\"Opposites attract, of course\\". Montreal Gazette, November 28, 2003.

History The Harn Museum of Art is named in honor of Samuel Peebles Harn (1893‚Äì1957), whose widow, three daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren made the founding gift to UF for the museum‚Äôs construction. The family pledged more than $3 million for the construction of an arts museum in 1983. The Harn Museum of Art opened September 20, 1990. In 2000, the family of David A. Cofrin made a gift to fund an 18,000-square-foot addition. The addition, named the Mary Ann Harn Cofrin Pavilion, opened in October 2005. The Cofrin Pavilion features 6,500 feet of exhibition space for international contemporary art, the Camellia Court Caf√©, an outdoor plaza and the Goforth Learning Center, which is used for meetings, programs and educational activities.alt=On February 6, 2008, Dr. and Mrs. David A. Cofrin made a commitment of $10 million to the University of Florida to fund the addition of a new wing dedicated to Asian art. Opened in 2012 on the northwest side of the museum, the 26,000-square-foot addition features an Asian art gallery, curatorial offices, and art storage and conservation space for the Asian collections. The expansion included an outdoor Asian garden to complement the new wing.Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art: About  Management  The founding director of the Harn Museum of Art was Budd Harris Bishop, who was previously at the Columbus Museum of Art. He joined in 1987 and selected the architect, hired staff and significantly built up the collection during his tenure. Bishop served as director through 1998. Rebecca Nagy served as museum director for 16 years until her retirement in 2018. In July 2018, Lee Anne Chesterfield (from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts) began serving as the Harn Museum's director.  Architecture  Harn Museum architecture The original architecture for the Harn Museum was designed by Kha Le-Huu, a native of South Vietnam and a 1982 architecture alumni of the University of Florida. Le-Huu reportedly designed the building to include buddhist sensibilities in the entrance garden along with featuring his contemporary aesthetic for geometric elements including use of the tetrahedron. Kha Le-Huu & Partners of Orlando, Florida also designed the additional wing for Asian art, completed in 2011. The Harn Museum features several outdoor gardens including an Asian Water Garden and an Asian Rock Garden designed by Hoichi Kurisu of Kurisu International. The Arts in Medicine (AIM) program at the University of Florida works together with patients to generate new patterns for the zen rock garden as a form of therapy at the Harn Museum.

The Norwegian monarchy can trace its line back to the reign of Harald Fairhair and the previous petty kingdoms which were united to form Norway; it has been in unions with both Sweden and Denmark for long periods. The present monarch is King Harald V, who has reigned since 17 January 1991, succeeding his father, Olav V. The heir apparent is his only son, Crown Prince Haakon. The crown prince undertakes various public ceremonial functions, as does the king's wife, Queen Sonja. The crown prince also acts as regent in the king's absence. There are several other members of the Royal Family, including the king's daughter, grandchildren and sister. Since the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden and the subsequent election of a Danish prince as King Haakon VII in 1905, the reigning royal house of Norway has been a branch of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg branch of the House of Oldenburg; originally from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany,Official royal house web site Retrieved 5 November 2007 the same royal house as the Danish and former Greek royal families. Whilst the Constitution of Norway grants important executive powers to the King, these are almost always exercised by the Council of State in the name of the King (King's Council, or cabinet). Formally the King appoints the government according to his own judgment, but parliamentary practice has been in place since 1884. Constitutional practice has replaced the meaning of the word King in most articles of the constitution from the king personally to the elected government. The powers vested in the monarch are significant but are treated only as reserve powers and as an important security part of the role of the monarchy. This information was verified by the prime minister himself. The King does not, by convention, have direct participation in government. He ratifies laws and royal resolutions, receives and sends envoys from and to foreign countries and hosts state visits. He has a more tangible influence as the symbol of national unity. The annual New Year's Eve speech is one occasion when the King traditionally raises negative issues. The King is also Supreme Commander of the Norwegian Armed Forces and Grand Master of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit.Royal House web site on the orders and medals Retrieved 21 November 2006 The King has no official role in the Church of Norway, but is required by the Constitution to be a member. History The position of King of Norway has been in continuous existence since the unification of Norway in 872. Although Norway has officially been a hereditary kingdom throughout that time, there have been several instances of elective succession: most recently, in 1905 Haakon VII was elected by the people of Norway to the position of king through a plebiscite. In recent years members of the Socialist Left party have proposed the abolition of the monarchy during each new session of parliament, though without any likelihood of success.Socialist Left web page on proposed republic (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 This gives the Norwegian monarchy the unique status of being a popularly elected royal family and receiving regular formal confirmations of support from the Storting. King Harald receives Norway out of his father's hands in this illustration from the 14th-century Flateyjarb√≥k. Germanic kingdom Prior to and in the early phase of the Viking Age Norway was divided into several smaller kingdoms. These are thought to have followed the same tradition as other Germanic monarchies of the time: the king was usually elected by the high-ranking farmers of the area and served mainly as judge at popular assemblies, as a priest on the occasion of sacrifices and as a military leader in time of war. Harald Fairhair was the first king of Norway. The date of the first formation of a unified Norwegian kingdom is set as 872, when he defeated the last petty kings who resisted him at the Battle of Hafrsfjord; however the consolidation of his power took many years. The boundaries of Fairhair's kingdom were not identical to those of present-day Norway, and upon his death the kingship was shared among his sons. Some historians emphasise the actual monarchial control over the country and assert that Olaf II, alias Saint Olaf, who reigned from 1015 to 1028, was the first king to control the entire country. Olaf is generally held to have been the driving force behind Norway's final conversion to Christianity. Furthermore, he was in 1031 revered as Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae (\\"Eternal King of Norway\\"), and subsequently the 1163 Succession Law stated that all kings after Olaf II's son, Magnus I, were not independent monarchs, but vassals holding Norway as a fief from Saint Olaf.History of Norway from the Norwegian government web site Retrieved 21 November 2006 Middle Ages Saint Olav ca. 1020 AD. The Finnmarken (\\"Marches of the Sami\\"), most of which paid tribute to the kings of Norway, are shown in pink. In the 12th and 13th centuries the Norwegian kingdom was at its geographical and cultural peak. The kingdom included Norway (including the now Swedish provinces of Jemtland, Herjedalen, S√¶rna, Idre and B√•huslen), Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Shetland, Orkney and other smaller areas in the British Isles. The king had diplomatic relations with most of the European kingdoms and formed alliances with Scotland and Castile, among others. Large castles such as Haakon's Hall and cathedrals, the foremost being Nidaros Cathedral, were built. In the tradition of Germanic monarchy the king had to be elected by a representative assembly of noblemen. Men eligible for election had to be of royal blood; but the eldest son of the previous king was not automatically chosen. During the civil war era the unclear succession laws and the practice of power-sharing between several kings simultaneously gave personal conflicts the potential to become full-blown wars. Over the centuries kings consolidated their power, and eventually a strict succession law made Norway a principally hereditary kingdom. In practice the king was elected by the Riksr√•d in a similar way to Denmark. He adhered to a h√•ndf√¶stning and governed in the council of Norwegian noblemen according to existing laws. After the death of Haakon VI of Norway in 1380, his son Olav IV of Norway succeeded to the thrones of both Norway and Denmark and was also elected King of Sweden. After his death at the age of 17 his mother Margrethe united the three Scandinavian kingdoms in personal union under one crown, in the Kalmar Union. Olav's death extinguished the Norwegian male royal line; he was also the last Norwegian king to be born on Norwegian soil for the next 567 years. The Black Death of 1349‚Äì51 contributed to the decline of the Norwegian monarchy, as the noble families and the population in general were gravely affected. But the most devastating factor for the nobility and the monarchy in Norway was the steep decline in income from their holdings. Many farms were deserted and rents and taxes suffered. This left the Norwegian monarchy weakened in manpower, noble support, defensibility and economic power. Surviving the unions The Kalmar Union was not only made possible by the complex history of the royal dynasties of Scandinavia but was also, among other things, a direct reaction to the expansive and aggressive policies of the Hanseatic League. On 6 June 1523 Sweden left the union permanently, leaving Norway in an unequal union with a Danish king already embarked on centralising the government of the union. In the following centuries the Norwegian monarchs mostly resided abroad. This weakened the monarchical governing structures of Norway: the Riksr√•d, for example, was gradually undermined as the Norwegian nobles did not have the King's confidence to the same extent as their Danish counterparts. The King was also less able to govern according to Norwegian needs, as the distance meant he and his advisors had less knowledge of conditions in Norway.The history of power during the Danish era (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 Norway was one of few countries where the archdiocese was coterminous with the national territory. The church was an important factor in trying to maintain the separate Norwegian monarchy. In the 16th century the power struggle between the Norwegian nobles and the king culminated at the same time as the Protestant Reformation. This prompted a set of events in which the struggle against Danish dominance in Norway was coupled with the struggle against the Reformation. When both failed the effects were harsh. The Norwegian Catholic bishops were replaced with Danes and the Norwegian church was subdued and made wholly Danish. The Norwegian Riksr√•d was abolished in 1536, and more and more foreigners were appointed to important positions in Norway. King Frederick III The Danish nobles pushed the king to reduce Norway to a Danish province in order for them to gain more control in the election of future kings. However, the hereditary nature of the Norwegian monarchy meant that the King had to maintain the basic principle of Norway being a separate and extant kingdom. If the Danish nobles were to elect as king someone other than the next in line to the throne the Union would be dissolved. This gave the king the upper hand in the negotiations for the h√•ndfesting. Potential heirs to Norway were present in both the royal dynasties of Sweden and Schleswig-Holstein, so if the King of Denmark did not assert his position as King of Norway they would. During this time the Danish kings were more preoccupied with securing the traditionally Danish fringe territories, and therefore paid little attention to and made few attempts at maintaining Norwegian interests. As a result, Jemtland, Herjedalen, B√•huslen, Shetland and Orkney were lost to Sweden and Scotland. In addition all contact with Greenland ceased. In 1661 Frederick III introduced absolute monarchy in Denmark and Norway and introduced new laws in both countries to that effect. Until then the law of Magnus the law-mender given in 1274 and 1276 had been the law of Norway. Christian IV's Norwegian law was in effect a translation into Danish of that older law. 1661 also marks the point when the last remnants of representational local government were removed and had to be rebuilt. However, that process started almost immediately when local men of means started putting pressure on local governors in order to gain or regain influence on local matters. Emerging independence The Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814. During the Napoleonic Wars the King aligned Denmark‚ÄìNorway with France. When Napoleon lost the war, the king was forced to cede Norway to the king of Sweden under the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. It was initially proposed that the Norwegian dependencies of Greenland, Iceland and the Faroes would remain with Norway, but that point was dropped during the negotiations, so they became Danish.History of Norway on historyworld.com Retrieved 21 November 2006 On hearing news of the treaty, the Prince of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway, Christian Frederick, the resident viceroy in Norway, participated in founding a Norwegian independence movement. The independence movement was successful, partly due to clandestine support from the Danish Crown, but also because of the strong desire for independence in Norway. On 10 April, a national assembly met at Eidsvoll to decide on a constitution. Norway declared independence on 17 May 1814, electing Christian Frederick as King. A short war with Sweden later that year ended with the Convention of Moss. This led to the ousting of Christian Frederick, and the Norwegian Storting electing Charles XIII of Sweden as King of Norway, creating the union between Sweden and Norway. In turn the king recognised the Norwegian constitution, which was only changed to facilitate the union. The end result was that the Norwegian monarchy became a constitutional monarchy. In this new union the King was much more a King of Norway than under the previous Danish system. The only area of policy not in the hands of the Norwegians was foreign policy. Norway had been brought along into the new developments of the world as they arrived in Denmark. However, with the break the Norwegians were able to forge a more progressive political development than was the case in Denmark. Denmark introduced a constitutional monarchy 35 years after Norway. Parliamentarism was introduced in Norway 17 years before Denmark and 33 years before Sweden.The introduction of parliamentarism is not as clear cut in Denmark and Sweden as in Norway. In Denmark the year 1901 is usually given, but the years 1905 and 1920 are also important in this respect. In Sweden a parliamentary system was reintroduced in 1917. The union with Denmark also had its adverse effects on the monarchy: among other things it resulted in the Crown of Norway losing territory which today amounts to 2 322 755 km¬≤ (although most of this was uninhabited areas of Greenland).This number is found by adding up the areas of J√§mtland, H√§rjedalen, Bohusl√§n, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Shetland and Orkney. The entire area of Greenland was not effectively controlled by anyone at the time; however it is today under the Crown of Denmark and therefore would have been under the Crown of Norway. Very little royal activity had been relocated to Norway; the country thus lacks the monumental palaces of the period which can be seen in Copenhagen and other parts of Denmark. Union with Sweden Royal Standard of Norway during the Union with Sweden The Treaty of Kiel stipulated that Norway was to be ceded by the king of Denmark‚ÄìNorway to the king of Sweden. This was however rejected in Norway, where calls for self-determination were already mounting. A Norwegian constituent assembly was called, and a liberal constitution was adopted on 17 May 1814. A short war ensued, ending in a new agreement between the Norwegian parliament and the Swedish king. Jean Baptiste Bernadotte [a.k.a. King Charles XIV John], Marshal of France, King of Sweden (1818). Joseph Nicolas Jouy, after Fran√ßois Kinson. As Crown Prince, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was primarily responsible for establishing the union. The Convention of Moss was from a Norwegian point of view a significant improvement over the terms dictated to Denmark-Norway at the treaty of Kiel. Notably, Norway was no longer to be treated as a Swedish conquest but rather as an equal party in a personal union of two independent states. Both the principle and substance of the Norwegian Constitution were preserved, with only such amendments as were required to allow for the union with Sweden. Norway retained its own parliament and separate institutions, except for the common king and foreign service. The Norwegian Storting would propose Norwegian laws without interference from Sweden, to be approved by the common King in his capacity as King of Norway. The King would occasionally enact laws unfavourable to Sweden. As the Norwegian movement towards full independence gained momentum, the King approved the building of forts and naval vessels intended to defend Norway against a Swedish invasion. The union was nevertheless marked by the Norwegians' constant and growing discontent with being in a union of any kind. The Storting would propose laws to reduce the king's power or to assert Norwegian independence. These would most often be vetoed by the king, but as he only had the power to veto the same law twice, it would eventually be passed. The constitution of 1814 already specified that Norway would have a separate flag, and the present design was introduced in 1821. The flags of both kingdoms were defaced with the union mark in 1844 to denote their equal status within the union. Despite royal objections, this was removed from the Norwegian flag in 1898. In 1837 local self-government in certain areas of policy was introduced in rural areas as well as towns.Gjerset, Knut (1915). History of the Norwegian People, Volumes II. The MacMillan Company. A Parliamentary system was introduced in 1884. The Royal House of Bernadotte tried hard to be a Norwegian royal house as well as a Swedish one. The Royal Palace in Oslo was built during this period. There were separate coronations in Trondheim, as stipulated in the Constitution. The royal princes even had a hunting lodge built in Norway so that they could spend more private time there.Royal House web page on Prinsehytta Retrieved 5 November 2007 King Oscar II spoke and wrote Norwegian fluently. Full independence King Haakon VII early during his reign. In 1905 a series of disputes between parliament and the King culminated with the matter of separate Norwegian consuls to foreign countries. Norway had grown into one of the world's leading shipping nations, but Sweden retained control of both the diplomatic and consulate corps. Although businessmen needed assistance abroad, the Swedes had little insight into Norwegian shipping, and consulates were not even established in several important shipping cities. The demand for separate Norwegian consuls was seen as very important by the Norwegian parliament and society. The Storting proposed a law establishing a separate Norwegian consulate corps. King Oscar II refused to ratify the law and subsequently the Norwegian cabinet resigned. The king was unable to form any other government that had the support of parliament, and so it was deemed on 7 June that he had failed to function as King of Norway.Royal House web page on the dissolution of the union Retrieved 5 November 2007 In a plebiscite of the Norwegian people on 13 August, there were an overwhelming 368,208 votes (99.95%) in favor of dissolution of the Union, against 184 (0.05%) opposed, with 85% of Norwegian men voting. No women voted, as universal suffrage was not granted until 1913; however Norwegian feminists collected more than 200,000 signatures in favor of dissolution. During the summer a Norwegian delegation had already approached the 33-year- old Prince Carl of Denmark, the second son of the Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark. The Norwegian parliament had considered other candidates but ultimately chose Prince Carl, partly because he already had a son to continue the line of succession, but more significantly because Carl was married to Maud of Wales, the daughter of King Edward VII. By bringing in a king with British royal ties, it was hoped that Norway could court Britain's support. Prince Carl impressed the delegation in many ways, not least because of his sensitivity to the liberal and democratic movements that had led to Norway's independence. Though the Norwegian constitution stipulated that the Storting could choose a new king if the throne were vacant, Carl was aware that many Norwegians ‚Äî including leading politicians and high-ranking military officers ‚Äî favored a republican form of government. Attempts to persuade the prince to accept the throne on the basis of Parliament's choice failed; Carl insisted that he would accept the crown only if the Norwegian people expressed their will for monarchy by referendum and if the parliament then elected him king. On 12 and 13 November, in the second constitutional plebiscite in three months, Norwegian voters decided by a nearly 79% majority (259,563 to 69,264) to keep the monarchy rather than establish a republic. The parliament, by an overwhelming majority, then offered Carl a clear mandate to the Norwegian throne on 18 November. The prince accepted the same evening, choosing the name Haakon, a traditional name used by Norwegian kings. The last king with that name had been Haakon VI, who died in the year 1380. Thus the new king became Haakon VII, King of Norway. His two-year-old son Alexander, the heir apparent, was renamed Olav and became Crown Prince Olav. The new royal family arrived in the capital Kristiania (later Oslo) on 25 November. Haakon VII was sworn in as king of Norway on 27 November. A new monarchy Royal Standard of Norway since 1905 The early years of the new Norwegian monarchy were marked by a shortage of funds. The Norwegian state was poor and funds were needed elsewhere than in the upkeep of a large court. In that sense it was a stroke of good fortune that Prince Carl had set as a condition for accepting the throne that he would not be forced to keep a large court. However, the royal travels and the upkeep of the royal residences, after the initial refurbishment in 1905, were to some extent neglected. One example of the negative financial situation is that Prince Carl had been promised a Royal Yacht when he accepted the throne, but this was not fulfilled until 1947.RNoN web page on the HNoMY Norge (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 One important incident in the early years of the new monarchy was in 1928 when the King appointed the first Labour government. The Norwegian Labour Party was at that time quite radical and even had the abolition of monarchy as part of their programme. It was the custom for the King to rely on the advice of the previous Prime Minister in deciding whom to give the assignment as new Prime Minister. In this case the previous conservative Prime Minister was opposed to giving power to the radicals and advised the appointment of someone else. But the King adhered to the established practice of parliamentarism and decided to appoint Christopher Hornsrud the first Labour Prime Minister. The Labour party later dropped the abolition of monarchy from their programme. During the German occupation of World War II the King was an important symbol of national unity and resistance. His steadfast opposition to the German demands of surrender was important for the fighting spirit of the Norwegian population. The constitutional powers granted to the King in the Norwegian monarchial system made his position very important and enabled the government in exile to continue its work with the utmost legitimacy. After the war the Norwegian royal house succeeded in maintaining a balance between regality and approachability. King Olav V was deemed the people's king and the spontaneous show of mourning from the population upon his death in 1991 demonstrated the high standing he had among the Norwegian people. Even republicans were among the masses lighting candles in front of the Palace.VG article on Socialist Left party leader's critique of the palace refurbishment where the republican admits to revering King Olav (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 In later years the marriages of the then Crown Prince Harald in 1968 and of Crown Prince Haakon in 2001 sparked considerable controversy, but the lasting effect on the popularity of the monarchy has been minimal. Although decreased from its level of above 90 percent after the war, support for the monarchy seems to remain stable around and mostly above the 70 percent mark.Aftenposten article on the Popularity of the Monarchy Retrieved 21 November 2006 In an opinion poll in 2012 93% of the people agreed the current Monarch does a good job for the country.VG article on the Monarch¬¥s popularity Retrieved 8 April 2012 Since 1991, the ruling Norwegian monarch have been a descendant of all previous Norwegian monarchs since 1818. Constitutional and official role Although the 1814 constitution grants important executive powers to the King, these are almost always exercised by the Council of State in the name of the King. Contemporary Norwegian constitutional practice has replaced the meaning of the word \\"king\\" in most articles from the meaning the King-in-person; apart from those dealing with the monarchy specifically, as opposed to those dealing with the apparatus of government and affairs of state at large; to the cabinet of the Prime Minister (also known as the King-in-Council when chaired by the King), which is accountable to the Storting, and thus ultimately to the electorate. Immunity Article 5 stated: The King's person is sacred; he cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility rests with his Council.The Constitution of Norway in English Retrieved 21 November 2006 This article applies to the king personally. The king has legal sovereign immunity, though his status as sacred was dissolved on 8 May 2018.NTB 2018. 'Fra tirsdag er ikke kongen lenger hellig'. NRK, 7 May. Retrieved on 8 May. https://www.nrk.no/norge/fra-tirsdag-er-ikke-kongen-lenger-hellig-1.14039929 Article 37 states: The Royal Princes and Princesses shall not personally be answerable to anyone other than the King, or whomever he decrees to sit in judgment on them. This means that the Princes and Princesses also have immunity on the discretion of the king. He could decide to let them be judged by the regular courts or he could decide to judge them himself. This has never been tested in practice. Council of State The Council of State consists of the King, Prime Minister and other members, all of whom are appointed by the King on the advice of Prime Minister. The Council of State is the Government of Norway and is chaired by the King. It meets under the King‚Äôs chairmanship at least once a week usually on Fridays. The King also orders the holding of extraordinary sessions of the council of state in situations that require urgent actions that cannot wait for the next scheduled meeting. Parliamentarism has been in place since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must not have the parliament against it, and that the appointment by the King is a formality. In practice, the monarch will ask the leader of a parliamentary block that has a majority in the Storting to form a government. The King relies on the advice of the previous prime minister and the President of the Storting in this question. The last time the King appointed a new prime minister contrary to the advice of the previous was in 1928 when he appointed the first Labour government. Article 12 states: The King himself chooses a Council from among Norwegian citizens who are entitled to vote. [...] The King apportions the business among the Members of the Council of State, as he deems appropriate. Article 30 states: [...] Everyone who has a seat in the Council of State has the duty frankly to express his opinion, to which the King is bound to listen. But it rests with the King to make a decision according to his own judgment. [...] Veto of laws The King has to sign all laws in order for them to become valid. He can veto any law. However, if two separate Stortings approve the law, it becomes valid even without the King's consent. The Crown has not vetoed any law since the dissolution of the union with Sweden. Article 78 states: If the King assents to the Bill, he appends his signature, whereby it becomes law. If he does not assent to it, he returns it to the Odelsting with a statement that he does not for the time being find it expedient to sanction it. In that case the Bill must not again be submitted to the King by the Storting then assembled. [...] Church of Norway Until 2012 the constitutional head of the Church of Norway, also known as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway, was the King. The Church of Norway professes the Lutheran branch of Christianity, and is a member of the Porvoo Communion. Since 2012 the Church has been self-governing, although it remains the established state church, which 86% of Norwegians are members of. In accordance with the constitution, the Norwegian King as head of state must be a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway. Pardoning criminals Article 20 states: The King shall have the right in the Council of State to pardon criminals after sentence has been passed. A pardon is the forgiveness of a crime and the penalty associated with it. It may be given if new information on the crime or criminal has come to light after sentencing has begun. A pardon may entail a complete or partial withdrawal of punishment. The practical execution of this right has been delegated to the Ministry of Justice which may dismiss an application for a pardon.Government web page on the procedure for pardoning criminals (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 The formal approval of a pardon has to be done by the King in Council. In 2004 a total of 51 applications for pardon were approved and 274 were denied.Private web page on criminal care in Norway (Norwegian) Retrieved 1 December 2006 In impeachment proceedings, the King cannot pardon a defendant without the consent of the Storting. Appointing senior officials Article 21 states: The King shall choose and appoint, after consultation with his Council of State, all senior civil, and military officials. The appointment is made by the Monarch after having been advised by the council of state and having received its consent. Dismissing the government Article 22 states: The Prime Minister and the other Members of the Council of State, together with the State Secretaries, may be dismissed by the King without any prior court judgment, after he has heard the opinion of the Council of State on the subject. Chivalric orders Article 23 states: The King may bestow orders upon whomever he pleases, as a reward for distinguished services[...] Norway has two chivalric orders: the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit. In addition the King awards several other distinguished medals for a wide range of accomplishments. War Article 25 states: The King is Commander-in-Chief of the land and naval forces of the Realm. The King is also Commander-in-Chief of the Norwegian Air Force: but it is not explicitly mentioned because there was no Air Force in 1814. Article 26 states: The King has the right to call up troops, to engage in hostilities in defence of the Realm and to make peace, to conclude and denounce conventions, to send and to receive diplomatic envoys. The King is treated by the armed forces as their highest commander, but there is, beyond legal fiction, no doubt that the complete control of the armed forces is actually held by the elected government of the day. The Kings of Norway have traditionally received an extensive military training and to some extent pursued a career within the armed forces before acceding to the throne. During World War II the King took a more active role in the decision-making and while the government still had the last word the King's advice was given much weight. On one occasion during the invasion the King was given an ultimatum by the Germans demanding Norway's surrender. King Haakon VII told the government he would abdicate if they decided to accept. In 1944 Crown Prince Olav was appointed Chief of Defence based on his military leadership abilities. Coronation King Haakon VII and Queen Maud in full regalia From before recorded Norwegian history the monarch would be installed by acclamation, a ceremony held on the ting where the king swore to uphold the laws of the land and the assembled chieftains swore allegiance to him. The first coronation in Norway and in all Scandinavia took place in Bergen in 1163 or 1164. For a long time both ceremonies were used in Norway. That way the king was invested with powers both from the noblemen and from the church. The coronations also symbolised that the king would hold the kingdom in fief to St. Olav the eternal king of Norway. The last acclamation took place on Akershus Castle in 1648. The last medieval coronation in Norway took place 29 July 1514. During the age of absolute monarchy (1660-1814), Norway's kings were crowned in Copenhagen, using the Throne Chair. Today the king still goes through a ceremony similar to the acclamation when he takes the oath of allegiance to the Constitution in the Storting. The Norwegian Constitution of 1814 determined that any Norwegian coronations from that time onward were to take place in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. This re-established the relationship to the sacred king's burial church. The constitutional article about the coronation was annulled in 1908. When king Olav V ascended the throne in 1957 he still wanted to receive the blessing of the church for his reign and the Benediction of the king was introduced. The benediction is a much simpler ceremony, but it still takes place in Nidaros Cathedral and with the Royal Regalia at the high altar. The regalia is currently located in the old Archbishop's Palace in Trondheim. King Harald V and Queen Sonja also received the benediction in 1991.The Royal Regalia at royalcourt.no, on display in Archbishop's Palace, Trondheim: Retrieved 6 May 2020 The Constitution requires the new King to immediately take an oath before the Storting (or, if the Storting is not in session, before the Council of State and again before the Storting once it is in session). The oath is as follows: \\"I promise and swear that I will govern the Kingdom of Norway in accordance with its Constitution and Laws; so help me God, the Almighty and Omniscient.\\" Succession The order of succession to the Norwegian throne has followed absolute primogeniture since 1990, as is described in article 6 in the Constitution of Norway. Only people descended from the reigning monarch are entitled to succeed to the throne. If the line of succession comes to an end then the Storting may elect a new king or queen. Finances The King, Queen, Crown Prince and Crown Princess are exempt from paying any taxes and their personal finances are not revealed to the public. Other members of the royal family have lost that privilege upon marriage. It is believed that only the King has a personal fortune of a notable size. The royal farms generate some revenue, but this is always re-invested in the farms themselves. In the Norwegian state budget of 2010 the sum of 142.5 million Norwegian kroner was allocated to the Royal Household. 16.5 million was also given to the monarchs as appanage. 20.9 million was in addition allocated to rehabilitation of royal property. In 2010, the Royal Household of Norway claimed that King Harald V's fortune was close to a 100 million Norwegian kroner. 500 million Norwegian kroner was in the late 1990s allocated to the extensive refurbishments of the royal residences that have been taking place and are still under way. The restoration of the Royal Palace in Oslo went far beyond budget because the structural state of the palace was much worse than expected. However, the large expense was criticised in the media.

The Coat of arms of Norway is one of the oldest in Europe and serves both as the coat of arms of the nation and of the Royal House. This is in keeping with its origin as the coat of arms of the kings of Norway during the Middle Ages.A web page featuring the history of the coat of arms of Norway Retrieved 21 November 2006 H√•kon the Old (1217‚Äì1263) used a shield with a lion. The earliest preserved reference to the colour of the arms is the King's Saga written down in 1220. In 1280 King Eirik Magnusson added the crown and silver axe to the lion. The axe is the martyr axe of St. Olav, the weapon used to kill him in the battle of Stiklestad in 1030. The specific rendering of the Norwegian arms has changed through the years, following changing heraldic fashions. In the late Middle Ages, the axe handle gradually grew longer and came to resemble a halberd. The handle was usually curved in order to fit the shape of shield preferred at the time, and also to match the shape of coins. The halberd was officially discarded and the shorter axe reintroduced by royal decree in 1844, when an authorized rendering was instituted for the first time. In 1905 the official design for royal and government arms was again changed, this time reverting to the medieval pattern, with a triangular shield and a more upright lion. The coat of arms of the royal house as well as the Royal Standard uses the lion design from 1905. The earliest preserved depiction of the Royal Standard is on the seal of Duchess Ingebj√∏rg from 1318.An article from the Norwegian National Archives depicting the seal of Duchess Ingebj√∏rg Retrieved 5 November 2007 The rendering used as the official coat of arms of Norway is slightly different and was last approved by the king 20 May 1992.Web page on rules for the use of the coat of arms (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 When used as the Royal coat of arms the shield features the insignias of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav around it and is framed by a royal ermine robe, surmounted by the crown of Norway.

Royal monograms carved in a mountain side to mark royal visits to Kongsberg since 1623. Today The Royal Family of Norway is a branch of the princely family of House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, originally from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany. Since 1991 the king has been Harald V, the 66th since unification, but the first king in many hundreds of years to actually have been born in Norway. Following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government in 1884, the duties of the monarch have become largely representative and non-partisan. He or she: * Is Head of State * Opens the Storting * Formally dissolves and installs governments * Presides over meetings in the Council of State (i.e. the Cabinet) * Is Commander-in-Chief of the Norwegian Defence Force * Receives credentials from ambassadors-in-waiting * Represents Norway during state visits both abroad and in Norway * Serves as fount of honour * Holds audiences with prominent Norwegian figures within politics, industry, commerce and culture * Until a constitutional amendment in 2012, functioned as the formal head or High Protector of the Church of Norway. However, the monarch does retain some royal prerogatives. He may issue pardons for prisoners (Article 20) and engage in war (Article 26), although it is unlikely that any of these two prerogatives would be put into use today. However, during the German occupation, Haakon VII said he would abdicate rather than appoint a collaborationist government led by Vidkun Quisling. The monarch acts a symbol of unity, and a majority of Norwegians are still in favour of retaining the monarchy. There is also broad political consensus on this issue.

Throughout the 1970s, Pratt enjoyed successes with Ken Boothe (\\"Artibella\\", \\"I'm Not For Sale\\"), Al Campbell, Delroy Wilson, Bobby Kalphat, and Keith Poppin, and had a major hit with \\"My Heart Is Gone\\" by John Holt, Dennis Brown's \\"Let Love In\\" and \\"Black Magic Woman\\", and Pat Kelly's \\"How Long\\", \\"Soulful Love\\" and \\"They Talk About Love\\". More particularly, from 1971 to 1975 Pratt produced many DJs including Dennis Alcapone (\\"This Is Butter\\"), Dillinger (\\"Platt Skank\\"), I-Roy (\\"My Food Is Ration\\") or U Roy (\\"Real Cool\\") and Jah Woosh (\\"Psalm 21\\" and \\"Zion Sound\\"), but he remains mostly known for the singles he recorded in 1972 with Big Youth (among his earliest songs), \\"Tell It Black\\" and \\"Phil Pratt Thing\\". Pratt mainly recorded in the Channel One Studios, working with the musicians who would later be called The Revolutionaries but also teamed with Lee Perry again, at Black Ark Studios producing among others Linval Thompson's first single. Pratt set up his own label Terminal in London in order to release his productions worldwide. He moved to London by the beginning of the 1980s and opened a restaurant there. In 1985, he produced the Clash of the Andy's album, featuring Horace Andy and Patrick Andy.

As a fallacy, quoting out of context differs from false attribution, in that the out of context quote is still attributed to the correct source. Arguments based on this fallacy typically take two forms: #As a straw man argument, it involves quoting an opponent out of context in order to misrepresent their position (typically to make it seem more simplistic or extreme) in order to make it easier to refute. It is common in politics. #As an appeal to authority, it involves quoting an authority on the subject out of context, in order to misrepresent that authority as supporting some position.Quoting Out of Context, Fallacy Files Contextomy Contextomy refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original linguistic context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning, a practice commonly referred to as \\"quoting out of context\\". The problem here is not the removal of a quote from its original context per se (as all quotes are), but to the quoter's decision to exclude from the excerpt certain nearby phrases or sentences (which become \\"context\\" by virtue of the exclusion) that serve to clarify the intentions behind the selected words. Comparing this practice to surgical excision, journalist Milton Mayer coined the term \\"contextomy\\" to describe its use by Julius Streicher, editor of the infamous Nazi broadsheet Der St√ºrmer in Weimar-era Germany. To arouse anti-semitic sentiments among the weekly's working class Christian readership, Streicher regularly published truncated quotations from Talmudic texts that, in their shortened form, appear to advocate greed, slavery, and ritualistic murder.Mayer, M. (1966). They thought they were free: The Germans, 1933‚Äì45. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press. Although rarely employed to this malicious extreme, contextomy is a common method of misrepresentation in contemporary mass media, and studies have demonstrated that the effects of this misrepresentation can linger even after the audience is exposed to the original, in context, quote.McGlone, M.S. (2005b). Contextomy: The art of quoting out of context. Media, Culture, & Society, 27, 511‚Äì22. In advertising One of the most familiar examples of contextomy is the ubiquitous \\"review blurb\\" in advertising. The lure of media exposure associated with being \\"blurbed\\" by a major studio may encourage some critics to write positive reviews of mediocre movies. However, even when a review is negative overall, studios have few reservations about excerpting it in a way that misrepresents the critic's opinion. For example, the ad copy for New Line Cinema's 1995 thriller Se7en attributed to Owen Gleiberman, a critic for Entertainment Weekly, used the comment \\"a small masterpiece.\\" Gleiberman actually gave Se7en a B‚àí overall and only praised the opening credits so grandiosely: \\"The credit sequence, with its jumpy frames and near-subliminal flashes of psychoparaphernalia, is a small masterpiece of dementia.\\" Similarly, United Artists contextomized critic Kenneth Turan's review of their flop Hoodlum, including just one word from it‚Äî\\"irresistible\\"‚Äîin the film's ad copy: \\"Even Laurence Fishburne's incendiary performance can't ignite Hoodlum, a would-be gangster epic that generates less heat than a nickel cigar. Fishburne's 'Bumpy' is fierce, magnetic, irresistible even‚Ä¶ But even this actor can only do so much.\\" As a result of these abuses, some critics now deliberately avoid colorful language in their reviews.Reiner, L. (1996). \\"Why Movie Blurbs Avoid Newspapers.\\" Editor & Publisher: The Fourth Estate, 129, 123, citing: *Gleiberman, Owen. (1995, September 22). \\"Se7en\\" (film review). Entertainment Weekly, p. 45. *Turan, Kenneth., (1997, August 27). Hoodlum: A fight for control of Harlem. Los Angeles Times, p. 8. In 2010, the pop culture magazine Vanity Fair reported that it had been the victim of \\"reckless blurbing\\" after the television show Lost had taken a review fragment of \\"the most confusing, asinine, ridiculous‚Äîyet somehow addictively awesome‚Äîtelevision show of all time\\" and only quoted \\"the most addictively awesome television show of all time\\" in its promotional material. Carl Bialik recorded an instance of an adverb being applied to a different verb in a 2007 advert for Live Free or Die Hard, where a New York Daily News quote of \\"hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining\\" was reduced to \\"hysterically... entertaining\\". In the United States, there is no specific law against misleading movie blurbs, beyond existing regulation over false advertising. The MPAA reviews advertisements for tone and content rather than the accuracy of their citations. Some studios seek approval from the original critic before running a condensed quotation. The European Union's Unfair Commercial Practices Directive prohibits contextomy, and targets companies who \\"falsely claim accreditation\\" for their products in ways that are \\"not being true to the terms of the [original] endorsement\\". It is enforced in the United Kingdom by the Office of Fair Trading, and carries a maximum penalty of a ¬£5,000 fine or two years imprisonment.Age banding, Philip Pullman, The Guardian, 7 June 2008Excellent!

Babinski (ed), TalkOrigins ArchiveAccording to the Quote Mine Project at TalkOrigins Archive, the first record of the term in talk.origins was a posting by Lenny Flank on March 30, 1997, with a February 2, 1996 reference in another Usenet group, rec.arts.comics.misc The term is used by members of the scientific community to describe a method employed by creationists to support their arguments,\\"The Counter-creationism Handbook\\", Mark Isaak, p. 14Quote-Mining Comes to Ohio , Glenn Branch though it can be and often is used outside of the creation‚Äìevolution controversy. Complaints about the practice predate known use of the term: Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote in his famous 1973 essay \\"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution\\": This has been compared to the Christian theological method of prooftexting: The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) described the use of \\"[a]n evolutionist's quote mistakenly used out of context\\" to \\"negate the entirety of [an] article and creationist claims regarding the lack of transitional forms\\" as \\"a smoke screen\\". Both Answers in Genesis (AiG) and Henry M. Morris (founder of ICR) have been accused of producing books of mined quotes. TalkOrigins Archive (TOA) states that \\"entire books of these quotes have been published\\" and lists prominent creationist Henry M. Morris' That Their Words May Be Used Against Them and The Revised Quote Book as examples, in addition to a number of online creationist lists of quote-mines.The Quote Mine Project, John Pieret (ed), TalkOrigins Archive Both AiG and ICR use the following quote from Stephen Jay Gould on intermediate forms. Context shows that Gould rejected the gradualists' explanation for the lack of support for gradual change in favor of his own interpretation. He continues: Knowing that creationists are quoting him as if he were saying there were no transitional forms, Gould responded: \\"Absurd in the highest degree\\" Since the mid-1990s, scientists and their supporters have used the term quote mining to describe versions of this practice as used by certain creationists in the creation‚Äìevolution controversy. An example found in debates over evolution is an out-of-context quotation of Charles Darwin in his Origin of Species: This sentence, sometimes truncated to the phrase \\"absurd in the highest degree\\", is often presented as part of an assertion that Darwin himself believed that natural selection could not fully account for the complexity of life.LTBS Quarterly, April 2000, Answers in Genesis: Natural selection, No Answers in Genesis: The incomprehensible creationist - the Darwin \\"eye\\" quote revisited, Talk.origins: Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA113.1 However, Darwin went on to explain that the apparent absurdity of the evolution of an eye is no bar to its occurrence, and elaborates on its evolution: Other out of context quotations Besides the creation‚Äìevolution controversy, the fallacy of quoting out of context is also used in other areas. In some instances, commentators have used the term quote mining, comparing the practice of others with creationist quote mining. * Entertainment: with The Times reporting its frequent abuse by promoters with, for example, \\"I couldn't help feeling that, for all the energy, razzmatazz and technical wizardry, the audience had been shortchanged\\" being pared down to \\"having 'energy, razzmatazz and technical wizardry.\\"A helluva show.

The Penn State Nittany Lions college baseball team began play at the ballpark in 2007. Seating capacity is 5,570 people. Events other than baseball games are held at the ballpark, and different seating configurations are available. This stadium was designed to feature an unobstructed view of Penn State landmark Mount Nittany over the outfield wall. History Penn State alumnus Anthony Lubrano first suggested upgrading Penn State baseball facilities to representatives of the university in 1995. After receiving a donation from Lubrano in 2002, the Penn State Board of Trustees voted to name the new stadium Medlar Field at Lubrano Park. In 2003, representatives of the Altoona Curve management group approached Penn State with the idea of sharing a ballpark that both the Altoona Curve and the Penn State baseball team would use as a home field. Final plans for the new ballpark were approved by the Penn State Board of Trustees on May 13, 2005. Ground was broken for the new ballpark on May 18, 2005. Among the dignitaries on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony were Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, Penn State president Graham Spanier, state Senator Jake Corman and Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley. The ballpark was named a 2006 Project of the Year in the area of sports by Mid-Atlantic Construction. Naming Medlar Field at Lubrano Park is named for two Penn State alumni, Charles Medlar and Anthony Lubrano. Coach Charles \\"Chuck\\" Medlar (1918-1999) was an athletic trainer at Penn State for 35 years, and the head Penn State baseball coach from 1963 to 1981. The Charles Medlar Award is given annually in his honor to the outstanding pitcher of the Penn State baseball team. Anthony Lubrano is a 1982 alumnus of the Penn State Smeal College of Business. Since graduation, Lubrano has established a successful financial services company. His donation of $2.5 million towards this project made him the lead benefactor, and Lubrano received from Penn State the opportunity to name this venue. Lubrano chose to name this venue Medlar Field at Lubrano Park in recognition of Coach Medlar's contributions to Penn State athletics. Features The \\"footprint\\" of the stadium (outfield dimensions, foul ground, etc.) is identical to PNC Park in Pittsburgh (home of the Pittsburgh Pirates) except for the right field wall. At PNC, the wall is 21 feet tall, but at Medlar Field, it is 18.55 feet tall to commemorate the year that Penn State was founded. The physical plant of this venue includes the stadium, parking areas, and a pedestrian plaza. The stadium has three levels, Field (clubhouse) Level, Concourse Level, and Luxury Suite Level. The street level entrance to the stadium is on the Concourse Level. Photos of the ballpark File:Medlar Field at Lubrano Park.JPGThe ballpark shortly before opening in 2006.

Field level There are three clubhouses in this stadium, one for the Nittany Lions, one for the State College Spikes, and one for the visiting team. Home team facilities include a weight room and training area for each team, an indoor batting cage, storage areas, and a laundry room. Entrance into the dugouts and onto the playing field for players is from this level. Concourse level This level includes a first aid station, a baseball-themed store called Off The Rack Outfitters, a customer service center, and restrooms. The State College Spikes offices are also located on this level. Amenities on the right field side of this level include the Outfield Bleachers seating area, and the Rail Kings seating area located on the Nittany Embroidery Fun Deck. The food concessions in this area include The Right Field Grill, Coaly's Corner, and The Batter's Eye. Amenities on the left field side of this level include the Left Field Picnic and a play area for children called the S&A; Homes Kids Zone. The food concession stands in this area are The Left Field Grill, The \\"Grand\\" Stand, and The Bullpen Caf√©. Food including Philly cheesesteaks, hot dogs, and ice cream will be sold by the concessions. Beer is sold during Spikes games, but not during Penn State games. Along with the Penn Stater Conference Center and The Nittany Lion Inn, this venue is one of only three Penn State facilities on the University Park campus where alcohol is allowed to be sold. Wheelchair- accessible seating is located on the concourse behind the Bullpen Box, Field Box, and Diamond Club seating areas. There is a wheelchair lift located in the left field picnic area, connecting the Concourse Level with the Field Level. An elevator also connects all three levels of the stadium, making all areas accessible. Luxury suite level The 20 luxury suites and the press box are located on this level. 18 luxury suites are designed to accommodate 20 people each, and two larger suites are designed to accommodate 40 people each. The Press Box consists of three broadcast booths for television and radio media. The Penn State Sports Journalism Center and the Penn State Baseball offices are also located on this level. Parking Two parking lots with a total of 502 parking spaces were built as part of this venue. The Porter North lot has 385 parking spaces and the Porter South Lot has 117. Improvements were also made to Parking Lot 44, which this venue shares with Beaver Stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Accessibility This venue is accessible by foot, bicycle, public transportation, car, and by air travel. As part of this venue's construction, a landscaped pedestrian plaza called Porter Gardens was built along Porter Road, bicycle racks were installed, and a Centre Area Transportation Authority (CATA) bus stop and drop-off zone was added for the Route H and Route P buses. Nearby highways include Pennsylvania Route 26, Interstate 99/U.S. Route 220, U.S. Route 322, and Interstate 80. University Park Airport is located approximately four miles (6.4 km) from the ballpark, and provides air travel connections to several cities.

Constructed in the autumn of 1915 at the behest of the Landship Committee, it was the first completed tank prototype in history. Little Willie is the oldest surviving individual tank, and is preserved as one of the most famous pieces in the collection of The Tank Museum, Bovington, England. Number 1 Lincoln Machine The No1 Lincoln Machine, with lengthened Bullock tracks and Creeping Grip tractor suspension, September 1915 Work on Little Willie's predecessor was begun in July 1915 by the Landship Committee to meet The United Kingdom's requirement in World War I for an armoured combat vehicle able to cross an trench. After several other projects where single and triple tracks had failed, on 22 July William Ashbee Tritton, director of the agricultural machinery company William Foster & Company of Lincoln, was given the contract to develop a \\"Tritton Machine\\" with two tracks. It had to make use of the track assemblies ‚Äì lengthened tracks and suspension elements (seven road wheels instead of four) ‚Äì purchased as fully built units from the Bullock Creeping Grip Tractor Company in Chicago. On 11 August actual construction began; on 16 August Tritton decided to fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It soon became clear that the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balat√° belting and flat wire ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage on the inside of the track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed. Description The vehicle's 13 litre 105 bhp Daimler-Knight engine, gravity fed by two petrol tanks, was at the back, leaving just enough room beneath the turret. The prototype was fitted with a non-rotatable dummy turret mounting a machine gun; a Vickers 2-pounder (40 mm) Maxim gun (\\"Pom-pom\\") was to have been fitted, with as many as six Madsen machine guns to supplement it. The main gun would have had a large ammunition store with 800 rounds. Stern suggested to Tritton that the gun could be made to slide forward on rails, giving a better field of fire, but in the event the turret idea was abandoned and the aperture for the crew plated over. In the front of the vehicle two men sat on a narrow bench; one controlling the steering wheel, the clutch, the primary gear box and the throttle; the other holding the brakes. Overall length of the final version with the lengthened tracks and rear steering wheels in place was . The length of the main unit without the rear steering wheels installed is . Most mechanical components, including the radiator, had been adapted from those of the Foster-Daimler heavy artillery tractor. As at least four men would have been required to operate the armament, the crew could not have been smaller than six. The maximum speed was indicated by Tritton as being no more than two miles per hour. The vehicle used no real armour steel, just boiler plate; it was intended to use 10 mm plating for production. Little Willie and Big Willie Little Willie showing its rear steering wheels, September 1915 Wilson was unhappy with the basic concept of the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, and on 17 August suggested to Tritton the idea of using tracks that ran all around the vehicle. With d'Eyncourt's approval construction of an improved prototype began on 17 September. For this second prototype (later known as \\"HMLS [His Majesty's Land Ship] Centipede\\", and, later still, \\"Mother\\"), a rhomboid track frame was fitted, taking the tracks up and over the top of the vehicle. The rear steering wheels were retained in an improved form, but the idea of a turret was abandoned and the main armament placed in side sponsons. Number 1 Lincoln Machine was rebuilt with an extended (90 centimetres longer) track up to 6 December 1915, but merely to test the new tracks in Burton Park, near Lincoln; the second prototype was seen as much more promising. The first was renamed Little Willie, the scabrous name then commonly used by the British yellow press to mock the German Imperial Crown Prince Wilhelm; Mother was for a time known as Big Willie, after his father Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. That same year the cartoonist William Kerridge Haselden had made a popular comic anti-German propaganda movie: The Adventures of Big and Little Willie. Although Little Willie was demonstrated alongside Mother in January 1916, it was by then peripheral to the development of British tanks. Though it never saw combat, Little Willie was a major step forward in military technology, being the first tank prototype to be finished.The development of the similar French Schneider CA1 started earlier in January 1915, but its first real prototype was only made in February 1916 During the remainder of World War I, some tank crews continued to informally refer to their vehicles as \\"Willies\\" or \\"buses\\". In 1922 the Royal Tank Regiment adopted a folk song called My Boy Willie as its regimental march. Today Little Willie was preserved for posterity after the war, having been saved from being scrapped in 1940, and is today displayed at The Tank Museum at Bovington. It is essentially an empty hull, without an engine, but still with some internal fittings. The rear steering wheels are not fitted and there is damage to the hull plating around the right‚Äìhand vision slit, possibly caused by an attempt at some point to tow the vehicle by passing a cable through the slit. This would have torn the tank's comparatively thin steel plating.

R. Miller High School is a public high school located in Brewton, Alabama educating students in grades 9-12. The school was named for local timber baron Thomas Richard Miller who financially contributed to the construction of the original school building. The school mascot is the T. R. Miller Tiger. Campus The current campus, located off Douglas Avenue in the northern section of town, was opened in 1962 after moving from the previous location, now the site of Brewton Elementary School, less than one mile south. The school consisted of three wings of classrooms, a lunch room, a gym, a choir room, an art room, and an office area. The school was expanded to include a fourth wing consisting of four science classrooms in 1994. More recent additions include an auditorium and band room (completed in 1998), a field house for the football program (completed in 2001), a new gym (completed in 2002), and a new football practice field, track, and concession stands (completed in 2011). In 2013, the lunchroom and two wings of classrooms were demolished. In 2014 a new wing consisting of sixteen classrooms and a lunchroom was completed. In 2014 construction also began on a second wing which would include more classrooms, a media center, and an office area. It was completed in 2015. The auditorium, band room, art room, choir room, two gyms, science wing, and field house were not torn down and are still in use. Renovations to the football stadium began in 2015 and included updates to the home bleachers, a new press box, and a new scoreboard. Renovations to the baseball field also began in 2015 and included new dugouts, new batting cages, a new scoreboard, and eventually new bleachers. Clubs and activities T. R.

The athletic program most closely identified with the school is the football team. The Tigers currently have six football state championships (1969, 1984, 1991, 1994, 2000, and 2002.) Most of the success had been under the helm of T. R. Miller graduate turned head coach Jamie Riggs. Under Riggs the Tigers won four state titles. The T. R. Miller football team was considered to be \\"the winningest football team of the 1990s\\" in the State of Alabama. In 2015, Riggs won his 300th coaching victory, becoming one of only four coaches in the state to achieve that milestone. On December 14, 2015 Riggs announced his retirement. On January 25, 2016 Riggs announced that he would put off his retirement until a suitable candidate for the position was found. On February 29, 2016 it was announced that Andrew Thomas of Trenton High School in Florida would take over as head football coach and athletic director effective April 1, 2016. Thomas resigned after a 5-5 season in 2017 which TRM failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1983. On Dec. 22, Keith Etheredge was hired as the new coach for the Tigers. Etheredge comes to TRM from Pell City where he coached two years. He is most known for his winning ways at Leeds High School, outside Birmingham. The Tiger track program has won numerous state championships over the last twenty years, most recently in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the Lady Tiger basketball team brought home state titles in 1995, 1996, 2002, and 2009. T. R. Miller also has a successful baseball team under head coach Kevin Madden, softball team under head coach Haley Lynch, volleyball and tennis teams under head coach Terri Lynne Peacock, golf team under head coach Benson Stonicher, and swim team under head coach Lisa Atkinson. T.R. Miller's biggest rivalry game is with the W.S. Neal Eagles of East Brewton. The annual football game with the Eagles is called the Battle of Murder Creek. http://www.ahsfhs.org/teams2/opponentseach2015.asp?Opponent1=W.S.%20Neal&Team;=T.R.%20Miller Notable alumni * Dowe Aughtman, former Auburn University football player, former NFL player * Anthony Redmon, former Auburn University football player, former NFL player * Walter Lewis, first black starting quarterback for the University of Alabama, Heisman Trophy nominee, former United States Football League/Canadian Football League player Notes Category:Public high schools in Alabama Category:School buildings completed in 1962 Category:Schools in Escambia County, Alabama ","title":"T.

The highway runs from MD 7 in Perryville north to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Conowingo. MD 222 connects Perryville, Port Deposit, and Conowingo along its route paralleling the Susquehanna River in western Cecil County. Due to limitations in the highway in Port Deposit, including a steep hill and a low railroad bridge, trucks are directed to use MD 275, MD 276, and US 1 through Woodlawn and Rising Sun to connect Interstate 95 (I-95) with US 222 in Conowingo. MD 222 was built as MD 268, a number presently assigned to North Street in Elkton. The state highway was paved from Perryville to Port Deposit in the late 1910s and early 1920s. MD 268 was extended north to Conowingo in the early 1930s. In 1938, MD 268 was superseded when US 222 was extended south from US 1 in Conowingo to US 40 in Perryville. US 222 was widened from Perryville to Port Deposit in the early 1940s and rebuilt around 1960. The highway was moved for the construction of I-95 interchange in the early 1960s and rebuilt south to Perryville in the late 1960s. MD 222 was established in 1972 on the portion of US 222 between MD 7 and US 40. The designation was extended from Perryville to Conowingo in 1995 when US 222 was rolled back to its former and present terminus at US 1 in Conowingo. Route description View south along MD 222 at MD 276 in Port Deposit MD 222 begins at an intersection with MD 7 (Broad Street) in the town of Perryville. The highway heads north as two-lane undivided Aiken Avenue, which reaches its northern end at US 40 (Pulaski Highway) immediately to the east of the toll plaza for the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge over the Susquehanna River. MD 222 continues northeast as Perryville Road, which crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The highway curves north and leaves the town of Perryville and passing Perryville High School. MD 222 intersects the southern end of MD 824 (Reservoir Road) and the entrance to the former Perryville Outlet Center before meeting I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. At the north end of the interchange, the highway briefly re-enters the town of Perryville, intersects the ramps to and from southbound I-95 and the entrance to Hollywood Casino Perryville, and passes west of a park and ride lot before it reaches a four-way intersection with the northern end of MD 824 (Blythedale Road) and the southern end of MD 275 (Perrylawn Drive). At this intersection, MD 222 turns west onto Bainbridge Road toward Port Deposit. MD 222 in historic Port DepositMD 222 heads west through farmland, crossing Happy Valley Branch before passing the entrance to the former United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, which contains the Edward W. Haviland House and the original campus of the Tome School. The highway descends from a high bluff to the Susquehanna River, during which southbound MD 222 has a climbing lane. Upon entering the town limits of Port Deposit, MD 222's name changes to Main Street and the highway makes a sharp turn to the north to parallel the river and Norfolk Southern Railway's Port Road Branch. The state highway intersects MD 276 (Center Street) in the center of Port Deposit. MD 222 passes the Paw Paw Building and intersects Granite Avenue before crossing Rock Run and passing under a low railroad bridge to the west side of the tracks. The highway leaves the town of Port Deposit and continues north as Susquehanna River Road, closely paralleling the river and passing through a unit of Susquehanna State Park along the river. Soon after crossing Octoraro Creek, MD 222 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with US 1 (Conowingo Road) at the eastern end of Conowingo Dam. Following US 1 northeast to the community of Conowingo leads to the southern terminus of US 222. MD 222 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from US 40 north to MD 275 within Perryville. History What is now MD 222 was originally designated MD 268. MD 268 was replaced by a southern extension of US 222 from US 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1938. The Susquehanna River Road section of US 222 was transferred from state to county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. However, that section was returned to state control through an August 23, 1961, agreement after Cecil County requested it be returned to the state. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved rolling back the southern end of the US 222 designation from US 40 to US 1 at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 from US 40 to US 1 in February 1996; however, the new designation had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995. The redesignation did not apply to Aiken Avenue; indeed, Aiken Avenue's designation was changed from US 222 to MD 222 in 1972. The first stretch of the Perryville-Conowingo highway to be improved was in Perryville, where Cecil County constructed with state aid a macadam road from the Aikin station on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad south toward the Post Road (now MD 7) by 1910. Cecil County extended the macadam road to the Post Road by 1919. The highway from the Aikin railroad crossing to Port Deposit was paved as a concrete road in two sections: from the railroad to near Port Deposit by 1921 and through Port Deposit by 1923. MD 268 was paved as a concrete road from Port Deposit to US 1 at Conowingo Dam between 1930 and 1933; the construction work included repurposing a railroad bridge across Octoraro Creek as a highway bridge. MD 268's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was constructed between 1931 and 1934. The old highway approaching the Aikin grade crossing became MD 449. MD 268 was proposed to be widened to from US 40 to US 1 in 1934. The portion of US 222 from US 40 to near Port Deposit was expanded to improve access between the U.S. Highway and United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, east of Port Deposit in 1942 and 1944. US 222 was widened and resurfaced between what is now the MD 222-MD 275--MD 824 intersection and Port Deposit in 1959 and 1960. The U.S. Highway was relocated as part of the construction of its original diamond interchange with I-95 in 1962 and 1963. The old alignment of US 222 east of its I-95 interchange became MD 824. The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from MD 7 to US 40 and reconstructed and widened from US 40 to the southern MD 824 intersection in 1968 and 1969. The widening work included widening US 222's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, which was removed and replaced between 1987 and 1989. The I-95 interchange was converted from a standard diamond to a four- ramp partial cloverleaf with all four ramps east of MD 222 between 1993 and 1994. Aiken Avenue was reconstructed in an urban streetscape project in 2001 and 2002. Junction listRelated routes=Former truck route Maryland Route 222 Truck was a signed truck bypass of MD 222 from MD 222 in Perryville to US 1 and US 222 in Conowingo. The signed route followed MD 275 from MD 222 in Perryville north to MD 276 in Woodlawn. MD 222 Truck continued north on MD 276 from Woodlawn north to US 1 west of Rising Sun. The truck route then headed west on US 1 (in a wrong-way concurrency) to US 222's southern terminus in Conowingo. MD 222 Truck was first signed by 2002. Signs for MD 222 Truck were removed by 2016 and replaced with signs directing trucks to I-95 and US 40 southbound and to US 222 northbound. Beginning of MD 222 Truck at the southern terminus of US 222 in 2010 Junction list Auxiliary routes MD 222 has three auxiliary routes that are maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) and provide access to the authority's facilities around I-95's interchange with MD 222 and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway toll plaza to the east of the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge. The highways were created as part of the reconstruction of MD 222's interchange with I-95 in 1993 and 1994. *MD 222A is the designation for Chesapeake Overlook Parkway, a spur west from the intersection of MD 222 and the ramps to and from southbound I-95. This spur intersects MD 222B near its western end and serves as the entrance to Hollywood Casino Perryville. MD 222A was assigned in 1994, and the highway received its name in 2010. *MD 222B is the designation for Turnpike Drive, a service road that heads south from MD 222A and veers west to parallel the southbound lanes of I-95. The state highway provides access to the MDTA administration building, the Perryville barracks of the Maryland State Police, and the adjacent truck weigh station on southbound I-95. MD 222B follows part of the course of what was the entrance ramp from MD 222 to southbound I-95. *MD 222C is the designation for G.R. Dawson Drive, a service road that heads west from MD 222 and parallels the northbound lanes of I-95. The state highway provides access to a truck weigh station on northbound I-95. MD 222C follows part of the course of what was the northbound I-95 exit ramp to MD 222. The designation was assigned in 1995, and the highway received its name in 2006.

The film stars Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson. The main plot follows Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS worker who begins hearing a disembodied voice narrating his life as it happens ‚Äì seemingly the text of a novel in which it is stated that he, the main character, will soon die ‚Äì and he frantically seeks to somehow prevent that ending. The film was shot on location in Chicago, and has been praised for its innovative, intelligent story and fine performances. Ferrell, who came to prominence playing brash comedic parts, garnered particular attention for offering a restrained performance in his first starring dramatic role. Stranger than Fiction was released by Columbia Pictures on November 10, 2006. Upon release, the film received positive reviews mainly for its themes, humor, and performances. Plot Harold Crick, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service, is a lonely man who lives his life by his wristwatch. He is assigned to audit an intentionally tax-delinquent baker, Ana Pascal, to whom he is attracted. He begins hearing the voice of a woman omnisciently narrating his life as if he were a protagonist in a novel, but cannot communicate with it. Harold's watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates, \\"little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\\". Worried, Harold consults a psychiatrist who attributes the voice to schizophrenia, but notes that if there really is a narrator, he should visit an expert in literature. Crick visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor. When Jules recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold's story, he encourages Harold to identify the author and determine whether the work is a comedy or tragedy. As Harold audits Ana, the two fall for each other. When Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him because they could be viewed as a bribe, Ana tells him to leave, making Harold believe his story is a tragedy. On the advice of Jules, Harold spends the next day at home trying to control his destiny by doing nothing, but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew that mistook the building for an abandoned one. Jules believes that since Harold cannot control the plot, he should accept his impending death and enjoy whatever time he has left. Harold takes a vacation from work, develops his friendship with his co- worker Dave, learns to play the guitar, and begins dating Ana. Harold reassesses his story as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation, Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as author Karen Eiffel. Jules, an admirer of Karen's work, reveals that all of her books feature the protagonist's tragic death. Karen struggles from writer's block and researches ways to kill the character Harold to complete her book. Her publisher sends an assistant, Penny Escher, to ensure the book is completed. When Harold finds Karen and she learns that Harold experiences everything she writes, she is horrified by the thought that her books may have killed real people. She tells Harold she wrote a draft of his death, but has not typed it up yet; the events in the book manifest when she strikes the period key. Penny suggests Harold read the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold cannot bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules confirms its excellence, labeling it as Karen's masterpiece; Harold's death is integral to its genius. Though Harold is distressed over his fate, Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death: this one death, at least, will have a deeper meaning. Harold reads the manuscript, then returns it to Karen, telling her the death she wrote for him is \\"beautiful\\" and she should keep it intact. He spends one last night with Ana. The next day, Harold prepares to return to work, despite Karen's voice narrating as she types up her ending. Because Harold's watch is three minutes fast owing to the imprecise time given to him weeks earlier, he reaches the bus stop early and watches as a boy falls in front of the oncoming bus. Harold leaps from the curb and pushes the child out of the way, but is struck by the bus. Karen cannot complete the sentence confirming Harold's death, and Harold wakes up in a hospital, injured but alive. He learns that fragments of his wristwatch blocked the right ulnar artery in his body after the collision, saving his life. When Jules reads Karen's final manuscript, he notes that the story is weaker without Harold's death. Karen admits the flaw, but points out that the story was meant to be about a man who dies unexpectedly; with Harold sacrificing himself, knowing he could have prevented his death, the story would have lost its tragic impact. In place of Harold, his wristwatch‚Äîanthropomorphized throughout the entire film‚Äîis the character who died tragically.

Helm next decided that the narrator should state that the man is going to die because, as Helm described, \\"there's something very poetic about the understanding of one's place in the universe, but it's far more dramatic when such understanding occurs only days before that life ends.\\" Helm and Doran began referring to the new project as \\"The Narrator Project\\" and developed the story through a process of Helm's bringing ideas and Doran's asking questions. One of Helm's main ideas involved engaging the movie's form as much as its content.SONY Pictures Entertainment (2006). \\"Stranger than Fiction: Production Notes\\", document archived at WebCite July 6, 2008 based on the version posted at this original URL. Helm named each of the film's chief characters after a famous scientist or scientifically influential artist, examples including Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, and Hilbert. When the character of Dr. Hilbert tells Harold that he has devised a series of 23 questions in order to investigate the narrator, it is a playful reference to Hilbert's 23 problems. The film's title derives from a quote by Lord Byron: \\"Tis strange‚Äîbut true; for truth is always strange, Stranger than fiction\\".1823, Don Juan: Cantos XIII, XIII, and XIV, George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron), Canto 14, Stanza 101, Quote Page 165, Printed for John Hunt, London. According to Helm, one of the film's major themes is of interconnectivity. Helm stated \\"Each of these characters ends up doing little things to save one another. There's an underlying theme that the things we take most for granted are often the ones that make life worth living and actually keep us alive.\\" Photography The film was shot on location in Chicago, Illinois. Dave's apartment, in which Harold takes residence after his own building partially is demolished, is part of the River City Condominiums.IMDB: Filming locations for ‚Äì Stranger Than Fiction (2006) Hilbert's office was in a lecture hall at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The CNA Center at 333 South Wabash Avenue in the Loop served as the location for the IRS office. The bakery that Ana Pascal runs is located in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago and is called La Catedral Cafe & Restaurant.La Catedral Cafe & Restaurant The movie theatre in the film is the Logan Theatre located in the Logan Square neighborhood.The Logan Theatre Many downtown Chicago locations were used for scenes involving Karen Eiffel, Penny Escher, and Harold Crick. Columbia Pictures distributed the film. The film partly was inspired by Playtime (1967), Jacques Tati's visionary comedy about modern urban life, and the cinematography and production design help create a claustrophobic sense of life in the city. Music The music for this film includes original scores by the collaborative effort of Britt Daniel (singer/songwriter of Spoon) and Brian Reitzell (composer for Friday Night Lights, The Bling Ring and Hannibal), as well as a mix of indie rock songs from various artists including Spoon. Reitzell is also the film's music supervisor. The soundtrack includes an original recording of \\"Whole Wide World\\", the song that Harold plays for Ana, by Wreckless Eric. Release Stranger than Fiction was released in the United States on November 10, 2006. It opened at #4 in the box office and grossed $13.4 million in 2264 theaters. Its widest release was 2270 theaters, across which it grossed $40.7 million. Outside the US, it grossed another $13 million, for a worldwide total of $53.6 million. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 73% approval rating based on 175 reviews; the average rating is 6.87/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A fun, whimsical tale about an office drone trying to save his life from his narrator, Stranger Than Fiction features a subdued performance from Will Ferrell that contributes mightily to its quirky, mind-bending affect.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 67 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating that the film was thought-provoking and moral, and that \\"Such an uncommonly intelligent film does not often get made...which requires us to enter the lives of these specific quiet, sweet, worthy people\\", and he also praised Ferrell's performance saying, \\"Will Ferrell stars, in another role showing that like Steve Martin and Robin Williams he has dramatic gifts to equal his comedic talent\\". Rolling Stone rated the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that though the premise of Ferrell's life being narrated is a set-up for farce, the film is \\"less self-reflexively clever and more intimate\\". Todd McCarthy in Variety positively reviewed the film, praising its invention and Ferrell's performance as nuanced: first playing a tight focused caricature of the company man, then exercising more humanity and wit without being \\"goofy\\".McCarthy, T.

Retrieved on January 26, 2009.  Origins  BAID grew out of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects, a formal club of American architects who had attended the Parisian school. From its beginning in 1894, the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects had been interested in improving architectural education in the U.S.. It took on the task of developing standard architectural \\"programmes\\" for design problems to be given as assignments in architecture schools and in independent ateliers. The intent was to raise performance standards, but the effect also was to standardize the way architecture was taught all across the United States. By 1900, most American architecture schools and many independent ateliers were participating. By 1916 the burden of providing problem statements and jurying the work from an increasing number of schools and ateliers exceeded the capacity of the Society, so it established BAID to carry on this work. Among sculpture professionals, the foundation of BAID ensured a supply of competent decorative sculptors, and allowed the members of the National Sculpture Society to position themselves as fine artists in comparison.  History  The National Sculpture Society deeded over a building at 126 East 75th Street to the newly created BAID.According to The American Magazine of Art for November 1916, the Courses began on September 18, 1916 in three departments. The architecture department was associated with a committee from the Society; the sculpture department with a committee from the National Sculpture Society; and the mural department with a committee from the Society of Mural Painters. Architect Frederic Charles Hirons of Dennison & Hirons was central to the founding and running of the school. Hirons had attended the Paris school from 1904 through 1909; co-founded BAID in 1916; designed the BAID building in 1928 (won through a competition, in the manner of Beaux-Arts); and served as president of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects from 1937 through 1939. Another founder was Lloyd Warren, the brother of Whitney Warren of Warren and Wetmore. He was instrumental in getting top figures from the sculptural and architectural fields to teach at BAID, and serve on competition panels, for the sake of the profession. In 1927 the first winner of the annual Whitney Warren architectural competition was Carl Conrad Franz Kressbach, a student at the Graduate School of Architecture at Harvard University (graduate of University of Michigan). His design \\"An airport for a large city\\" drew interest among persons concerned with the future of commercial aviation, it depicted a scheme for dispatching and receiving commercial planes.NY Times, 12/24/1927 In 1956 the Institute changed its name to the National Institute for Architectural Education, reflecting a change of focus away from European traditions. In 1995 it was again renamed the Van Alen Institute.  Activities  BAID architectural competitions were published across the country, administered through university architecture schools or independent studios, and the entries all graded by jury at once. The highest number of entries received was in the 1929-1930 year, when 9500 entries came into New York City for judging. BAID also had on-site instruction and classrooms, with large sculpture studios open long hours and into the evenings for the convenience of working students and part-time teachers. The school tended to be populated by students who were either immigrants or first-generation Americans. They often came from working-class backgrounds, and their training was towards getting a union job in the building trades, rather than becoming a fine arts sculptor. Many of these students also attended the Art Students League of New York.

The letters are written in a rough, inelegant hand. The scribe who wrote the text is believed to have been unfamiliar with Greek. The codex is located now in Tbilisi (Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, Gr. 28).  Name and history  Many people think that the text gets its name from the town in which it was discovered. This is not correct. The Editio Princeps by Beermann and Gregory\\"Die Koridethi-Evangelien\\", Gustav Beermann und Caspar Ren√© Gregory, Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1913 states: Kala/Caucasia: In the year 1853 a certain Bartholome√© visited a long abandoned monastery in Kala, a little village in the Caucasian mountains near the Georgian/Russian border (some miles south east of the 5600m high Elbrus). There, in an old church, far off every civilisation, he discovered the MS. The MS rested there probably for several hundred years (Beermann: ca. 1300‚Äì1869). (as 1360) Koridethi: Before this time the MS was in a town called Koridethi. This was a village near the Black Sea, near today's Batumi in Georgia. There should still be some ruins of a monastery. Notes in the Gospel indicate dates from ca. 965 CE on. At around this time, according to a note, the book has been rebound. The book was there until around 1300 CE. Further south, Armenia: A Greek inscription mentions the city of Tephrice or Tephrike (): \\"I, Kurines, Comes of the comandant of the city Tephrice came to the castelles and went back to the fort of the Great Martyrs(?).\\" Even though the content and meaning is not completely clear, the city Tephrice is clear. The town was destroyed in 873. It was on a line between today's Sivas and Malatya in Turkey/Armenia. Beermann's conclusion therefore is (p. 581) that the codex must be older than 873 CE. Beermann speculates that the \\"fort of the Great Martyrs\\" (if correctly deciphered) might have been Martyropolis, a town near the Wan Lake, near today's Batman in Turkey. ; Witness of Byzantine text- type In 2007 the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft edited The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition. Koridethi is cited in the apparatus. In the Introduction to this edition is written: \\"Manuscript 038 (Œò) represents a text on the boundary of what might reasonably be considered a manuscript of the Byzantine tradition in John\\".The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition, Stuttgart 2007, Introduction, p. V.  Text of the codex  The text-type of Matthew ch. 1-14, Luke, and John is more or less Byzantine, while Mark is Caesarean. The text of the Matthew ch. 14-28 is Alexandrian. Aland placed it in Category II. It lacks the text of the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11). Matthew 1:11 : It reads ŒôœâœÉŒπŒ±œÇ Œ¥Œµ ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒôœâŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒπŒº, ŒôœâŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒπŒº Œ¥Œµ ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒôŒµœáŒøŒΩŒπŒ±ŒΩ instead of ŒôœâœÉŒπŒ±œÇ Œ¥Œµ ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒôŒµœáŒøŒΩŒπŒ±ŒΩ.

History The award was born in 1996 when Neil Burns, the former Somerset wicket-keeper-batsman, and now a director of NBC Sports Management Ltd, met Denis Compton while playing for Sir Paul Getty's XI. Burns put forward his ideas for a structured programme that would see promising young English players sent for coaching in South Africa during the English winter. Compton was interested in the proposals, and after the approval of the TCCB was obtained, the first awards were made that same year.Cricinfo List of Winners (Accessed 7 January 2012) Recipients=1996

A fan favorite, he was a Pro Bowl selection in 1984, played in Super Bowl XXVIII and Super Bowl XXX, and was on the Cowboys' roster for Super Bowl XXVII. He played college football at the University of Tennessee. Early years Bates attended Farragut High School in Farragut, Tennessee, where he played under rising head coach Ken Sparks. He recorded over 1,000 return yards, 14 interceptions, and nearly 200 tackles during his high school career where he was known for his hard hitting tackles. 1979 Tennessee Volunteers Football Program (University of Tennessee, 1979), p. 56. Retrieved: July 3, 2013. He helped lead the Admirals to the state semi- finals in 1978, in which the Admirals lost to Red Bank by one point. He was all-state in football and basketball his senior year. He also practiced track and field. He was considered the 4th best high school recruit in the state in football. College career Bates played college football at the University of Tennessee from 1979 through the 1982 season, where he was a four-year starter, the first two at free safety and the last two at strong safety. As a freshman in 1979, he registered 55 tackles (35 solo), 3 sacks, an interception, and 2 fumble recoveries. In 1980, he had 43 tackles (24 solo), including 3 tackles for a loss, to go along with an interception and 2 fumble recoveries. In 1981, he tallied 71 tackles (48 solo) and a team-leading 4 interceptions. During his senior year in 1982, he registered 86 tackles (61 solo), including 2 tackles for a loss, and 3 interceptions.Tennessee Career Football Statistics , UTSports.com. Retrieved: July 3, 2013. On October 20, 1979, Bates recorded 8 tackles, a sack, and 2 fumble recoveries against Alabama, who were ranked number one and would go on to win the national championship that year.1980 Tennessee Volunteers Football Program (University of Tennessee, 1980), p. 38. At the end of 1979 he was honored by being named to the Freshman All-American team. He also won the team's \\"hardest hitter\\" award on several occasions throughout his career. He was named second team All-SEC as a junior and senior. During Tennessee's 16-15 loss to eventual national champion Georgia on September 6, 1980, Georgia running back Herschel Walker and Bates met on the 5-yard line in a play that still lives in many college football highlights. Walker ran over Bates to score the first touchdown of his college career.Tim Hix, \\"Vol Profile: Bill Bates ,\\" Tennessee vs. Washington State Football Program (University of Tennessee, 1982), pp. 47-48. The two would later become teammates for several seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. Professional career Bates went undrafted in the 1983 NFL Draft after he ran the 40-yard dash in a disappointing 4.8 seconds during the NFL Scouting Combine. He was selected by the New Jersey Generals in the 1983 USFL Territorial Draft, but he decided to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Dallas Cowboys, which had been his favorite team growing up. He was a long shot to make the team but he earned a roster spot. From the start he excelled on special teams, being named NFC special teams player of the year as a rookie. In 1984 he was selected to the Pro Bowl in just his second year, causing the NFL to create a first-time roster spot for special teams players, making Bates the first such player to receive that election. He was also elected All-Pro that season. In 1986, Bates became a starter at strong safety and remained there until 1988, after which he was used only in the Nickel defense packages. At the end of the 1989 season, Jimmy Johnson informed Bates that he was going to be left unprotected on the team‚Äôs Plan B free agency list. Although the Minnesota Vikings were interested in him, just before the deadline, the Cowboys decided to protect him. In 1989, he was the leader in special teams tackles with 19. The next year, he led the team again with 23 tackles, becoming the first player in franchise history to do it in consecutive years. Bates received the team‚Äôs Bob Lilly Award four consecutive seasons from 1990 to 1994. This award is selected by a vote of the fans and annually goes to the Cowboy player who displays leadership and character on and off the field. In 1992, he suffered a season-ending knee injury. After the 1993 season, he was selected by his teammates to receive the Ed Block Courage Award for successfully overcoming his injury and leading the team in special teams tackles (25). Bates is tied with Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones and Mark Tuinei for the most seasons playing in a Cowboys uniform with 15. Upon his retirement after the 1997 season, he was considered one of the most beloved Cowboys of all time. Over his 15-year career, he had 14 interceptions and 122 return yards. Bates earned three Super Bowl rings with the Cowboys, playing in Super Bowl XXVIII and Super Bowl XXX. He was on injured reserve during the 1992 season, when the Cowboys played in Super Bowl XXVII, due to a knee injury. Tom Landry once said, ‚ÄúIf we had 11 players on the field who played as hard as Bill Bates does and did their homework like he does, we‚Äôd be almost impossible to beat‚Äù.ESPN 50 Greatest Dallas Cowboys. Retrieved: July 3, 2013. He described Bates and Cliff Harris as \\"the hardest hitters I ever saw.\\"Editorial Review for Shoot for the Star, Amazon.com. Retrieved: July 3, 2013. Referring to Bates' reputation as a hard hitter, John Madden stated, \\"Every game starts with a kick. With Bill Bates on the field, every game begins with a bang!\\" Personal life After his retirement as a player following the 1997 season, Bill was an assistant coach for the Cowboys for five years under head coaches Chan Gailey and Dave Campo. In 2003, Bill spent a year as special teams coach under head coach and former Cowboy linebacker Jack Del Rio. Beginning in 2004, he coached football at his sons' high schools, Nease High School and Ponte Vedra High School in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL. https://premierespeakers.com/bill- bates/bio Bill and his wife Denise have five children: Graham, Brianna, and Hunter (triplets), Tanner and Dillon. Graham played college football at Arkansas State and Hunter played college football at Northwestern University, respectively. Dillon followed in his father's footsteps to play for The University of Tennessee. In 2005, Bates was inducted into the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame. He was also named to the 100 Year All Tennessee Team. In 2011, Bates was awarded the Tom Landry Legend Award. Bill and his wife have stayed in Ponte Vedra and are grandparents to his son Hunter.

Despite its name, this is not part of the Digimon World series, as suggested by its localized title, but the game does bear a resemblance to Digimon World 3. In the game, the player controls a Digimon tamer and embarks on a journey to discover, tame, raise, train and command more than 230 unique Digimon. The player can build Digi-Farms to raise, evolve and communicate with the Digimon. Using Wi-Fi and local DS wireless connection, players can interact by exchanging Digimon, engaging in battles, and pooling resources to create rare types of Digimon. To date, the game has spawned five sequels in Digimon World Dawn and Dusk, Digimon Story Lost Evolution, Digimon Story: Super Xros Wars Red and Blue, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth ‚Äì Hacker's Memory. Gameplay Three of the player's Digimon, named \\"Apollo\\" (MetalGreymon), \\"Boomer\\" (Yatagaramon), and \\"Tigh\\" (DoruGreymon), battle an enemy Diatrymon. New Digimon Digimon World DS marks the first appearance of several Digimon, some that later appear in Digimon Savers, like Gawappamon, the evolution of Kamemon. Chronomon Destroyer Mode/Chronomon Holy Mode, the game's final boss, also makes his first appearance. The game introduces two special Digimon, DotAgumon and DotFalcomon, both of which have the appearance of sprites which look like their V-Pet counterparts. These Digimon seem to have no special qualities except for useful traits, and being able to be degenerated back into their In-Training forms, then evolve into more powerful Digmon. The forms for the Digimon are in-training, rookie, champion, ultimate, and mega. Unusual Digivolutions Digimon World DS features rather unusual Digivolution lines for some of its Digimon; Many Digimon have digivolution lines that do not correspond with established lines in other media. The digivolution lines in Digimon World DS and other Digimon media are equally valid as Digimon do not have set evolutions, rather suggested lines that are logical upgraded forms. * Poyomon along with several other Fresh level Digimon are In-Training level in the game, and digivolve into Rookie level Digimon. Because of this, Poyomon can digivolve into either Gomamon, Crabmon, or Kamemon (all of which are Aquan types.) * Leomon does not have SaberLeomon as a mega form (Rapidmon gets that honor), instead he digivolves into Monzaemon who can then digivolve into BantyoLeomon. * Angewomon digivolves into MarineAngemon instead of Ophanimon or Magnadramon, although Ophanimon is an NPC in the game. Magnadramon is absent from the game. * Gekomon cannot digivolve into ShogunGekomon, because ShogunGekomon only appears as a non- obtainable boss. Instead, Gekomon digivolves into Whamon. Story Sometime in the 21st century, rapid developments in technology have spawned life forms --Digital Monsters--in the Digital World. This sparks rumors of a cover-up by the DATS organization under the National Public Safety Commission. To substantiate the rumors, the protagonist sneaks into the school computer room, where the protagonist is transported to the Digital World. As he or she raises and befriends new Digimon and rises in the rank, he or she faces all sorts of adventures. He or she meets great friends, and makes some powerful enemies. Most of the times, any crisis that he or she deals with has been orchestrated by an evil entity calling himself Unknown-D. Reception Famitsu gave the game a relatively positive score of 30/40, receiving cross review scores of 8, 7, 8, and 7, respectively, as well as earning a \\"must buy\\" recommendation for the month. It also appeared in Famitsu's list of 100 best selling Nintendo DS games in their December 2006 issue, ranking in at number 33, with 213,770 copies sold. Reviews in English-speaking countries for Digimon World DS have generally been favorable, averaging at a 72% on GameRankings. IGN reviewer Jack DeVries claims that \\"...despite its derivative nature and somewhat mediocre elements, it's still a lot of fun...\\" and recommends the game \\"...for players that are dying to get their monster battling RPG fix\\", also meriting it for its humorous scriptwriting and unique method of collecting Digimon, giving it a final score of 7.5/10. GamePro gives the game a 3.75/5, saying \\"old Digimon fans will absolutely love this game; it's a repackaging of the older Digimons, but with much more to do.\\" Game Vortex has given the strongest review of 83%, saying that it's \\"great for Digimon fans.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official Site Category:2006 video games World DS Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with isometric graphics ","title":"Digimon World DS"},{"id":"4155211","text":"The infield and the outfield Potter County Memorial Stadium is a baseball-only stadium in Amarillo, Texas. It was most recently home to the Texas AirHogs, a professional baseball team and member of the American Association, and the West Texas A&M; Buffaloes baseball team, which is a member of the Division II Lone Star Conference. It was home to the Amarillo Dillas of United League Baseball until 2010. It broke ground in 1948, and opened in 1949. It is nicknamed Dilla Villa, dating back prior to Amarillo National Bank's purchase of naming rights when the Dillas made their first appearance in Amarillo in 1994. Following the 2016 season it was announced the AirHogs would not be returning to Amarillo citing \\"deplorable\\" field conditions. Pre-Dilla era The Potter County Memorial Stadium was home to several minor league baseball clubs before hosting the modern Amarillo Dillas squad. In PCMS's first season to host baseball, the Amarillo Gold Sox were in business. The Gold Sox would spend 1959-1965 and 1976-1982 hosting AA professional baseball in the Texas League. The Gold Sox had also played in Class A and B leagues in 1955-1958\\\\. Stadium features There are several features of the Amarillo National Bank Dilla Villa that are architecturally unique. The stadium however is one of the few classic stadiums left from the older baseball era and unfortunately is dealing with its share of difficulties. Seating The Amarillo National Dilla Villa seats 8,500 people, with three levels of seating. It features 17 field level box seat sections. Situated just above the box seats, are the club level seats. These seats range from sections A to M, and house the better majority of the stadiums seats. The stadium features two general admission bleacher sections on the first and third base sides. Directly behind home plate in the upper level are 4 levels of luxury boxes used for groups and parties. On either side of the home plate luxury boxes are sections of the blue fold down seats, the only covered seats that are fold down. Aside from the main grandstand, metal bleachers and box seats sit further down the third base line, and a party deck further down the first base line. Dilla Villa against Edinburg in 2007. Concourse The Dilla Villa houses one of the few non-major league stadiums in the country to have an upper and lower level concourse. The lower level concourse is the major one, leading to the main grandstand. It also houses 5 concession stands, 2 bars, and a souvenir shop. The upper level concourse is only accessible from the upper level, or from two staircases at the front of the ballpark. The concourse houses a beer stand, a concession stand, and the stadiums' bathrooms. No smoking is allowed in the ballpark, but there is a designated section behind the metal bleachers along the third base line. Problems The Potter County Memorial Stadium underwent a major renovation in the winter of 2005, replacing many of the badly needed renovations. The Central League's Dillas left behind many problems that the United League's Dillas successfully tackled. Before the renovations in 2006. Numerous seats in the stands were broken, cracked, or were stolen. Bleachers in the upper section had been separated and the paint was chipped. The grass was in poor shape, and the field itself was in bad shape. The backstop behind home plate was wooden, and was also rotting, and there were also numerous holes in the nets. Despite easily redoing these problems for the United League team, problems have begun to plague the Dillas. =Scoreboard= The Dillas were left with a barely active, older electronic scoreboard, which was in use back in the early 1990s. They made do with the scoreboard until the 2007 season, in which they bought a smaller, standard scoreboard just displaying score, inning, and strike-ball-out counts. Before the 2008 season began, a circuit board was stolen out of the scoreboard, which made it inoperable. The manufacturer would not sell the Dillas a new one because the scoreboard had never been paid for. Nonpayment of the scoreboard was due to the bankruptcy of the ULB's President Bradley Wendt. =Electricity= Several problems have existed with the field lighting fixtures and the concourse lighting at the Dilla Villa. Problems became apparent after a game between the Dillas and the Coyotes was cancelled after hurricane-like weather blew in. That night, two of the transformers powering the Dilla Villa exploded. Afterwards, three subsequent games were cancelled due to light failures at the stadium. New stadium Rumors of a new ballpark being built along the Interstate 27 and Hollywood Road parts of Amarillo have been spurred by the serious advancement in the revitalization of downtown Amarillo, Texas. Several case studies were conducted on whether or not a new ballpark would be feasible in downtown Amarillo. The study revealed that a multipurpose event venue such as a ballpark would be a feasible investment. Some rendering of a possible downtown set-up have shown a ballpark just south of the Amarillo Civic Center at 8th Avenue and Buchanan St. A ballpark, along with many other projects, have become serious discussion and construction could take place as soon as 2016. Questionable future In May 2015, a non- binding referendum was voted on for funding a new baseball stadium, with a margin of 52-48% voting \\"yes\\"https://www.amarillo.com/article/20151103/NEWS/311039429.After the Airhogs departure in 2016, Amarillo was left without a professional baseball team. However, on June 21, 2017, Elsinore Sports Group announced that the San Antonio Missions would be moving to Amarillo as the Colorado Springs Sky Sox were moving to San Antonio, with an understanding that a new stadium would be built. Shortly after the announcement, San Jacinto, a local private school signed a five-year lease to play at the stadiumhttps://www.amarillo.com/opinion/20180425/editorial-tearing-down- potter-countys-stadium-needs-to-be-option. In February 2018, the new stadium broke ground in downtown Amarillo on the property formerly occupied by Coca- Cola. On May 30, 2018, it was announced that the franchise would be named the Amarillo Sod Poodles.

The statistical district of Schalkwijk had a population of about 1650 in 2004.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Gemeente Op Maat 2004: Houten . History According to the 19th century historian A.J. van der Aa, Schalkwijk was a heerlijkheid owned by the lords of Culemborg. In 1523, the dike of the Lek river at Schalkwijk broke, and the village was severely damaged by the flooding. When the current municipal system was introduced in the Netherlands in 1812, Schalkwijk and Tull en 't Waal merged to become a single municipality called Schalkwijk. In 1818, Tull en 't Waal became independent again, and Schalkwijk was a separate municipality until it merged with Houten on 1 January 1962. The municipality of Schalkwijk included the village of Schalkwijk itself and the surrounding former hamlets Rietveld, Blokhoven, and Pothuizen. Its area was 17.9 km2. Most of the inhabitants were Roman Catholic, and went to church in the St. Michael's Church in the village centre.

He was a member of the Newfoundland Regiment and noted as one of the best snipers in the British forces during the war. Shiwak, an Inuk, lived at Cul-de-Sac, a small community near Rigolet, at the entrance to Lake Melville. According to family lore, the family name was changed from Sikoak, an Inuit word meaning newly formed ice, by Harry Paddon of the Grenfell Mission to Shiwak. He was a hunter in the far interior of Labrador and also of the Labrador Sea near his hometown, where he learned to handle a rifle. Shiwak had joined the Legion of Frontiersmen, a paramilitary organization that had been founded in Great Britain in 1905 and had set up operations in Newfoundland in 1911. In 1915 Shiwak left Rigolet for St. John's and enlisted in the Newfoundland Regiment on July 24. During his time in the war his superiors recognised his abilities as a sharp shooter and, on April 16, 1917, he was promoted to Lance Corporal. Capt R.H. Tait provided the following details about John Shiwak's death in a letter written on February 12, 1918 : \\"I was present on the morning of Nov. 21st when the above NCO was killed. We had taken part of the village (Masni√®res) in the attack on the 20th, and remained in our consolidated positions on that night. The next day we were ordered to take up a position on the other end of the village and act as counter attacking battalion if required. We assembled in the Sucrerie and, having formed up, along the canal bank toward another sugar factory where Batt‚Äôn HQ was to be located. The enemy at the time were shelling the bank and one shell burst right in the middle of our column and killed seven, amongst whom was L/C Shiwak, and wounded about ten others. Shiwak was buried that afternoon in the village of Masni√®res and close to the spot where he fell. His loss was keenly felt by the whole Regiment as he was a great favourite with all ranks, an excellent scout and observer, and a thoroughly good and reliable fellow in every way. Shiwak will long be remembered by all who knew him.\\" See also * List of people of Newfoundland and Labrador * List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador References and notesExternal links * *The Inuk Sniper : John Shiwak of Labrador was a top marksman in WWI (Up Here Magazine) *John Shiwak, Inuk War Hero *Inuk L/Cpl John Shiwak *Eskimo Hero from Labrador dies in War (Montreal Daily Star 1918-04-26) *John Shiwak Royal Newfoundland Regiment *Indian and Northern Affairs mention of John Shiwak *Inuk WWI veteran remembered as regiment's best sharpshooter *John Shiwak - An Inuit Frontiersman by Dean Bruckshaw, Historian & Archivist (Canada), Legion of Frontiersmen (Countess Mountbatten's Own) * Photo of John Shiwak *Lance Corporal John Shiwak from the \\"Canadian Great War Project\\" Category:1889 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Inuit from Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Legion of Frontiersmen members Category:People from Labrador Category:Canadian Indigenous military personnel Category:Newfoundland military personnel of World War I Category:Canadian military personnel killed in World War I Category:Canadian Expeditionary Force soldiers ","title":"John Shiwak"},{"id":"4155230","text":"Book cover Red Cavalry or Konarmiya () is a collection of short stories by Russian author Isaac Babel about the 1st Cavalry Army. The stories take place during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and are based on Babel's diary, which he maintained when he was a journalist assigned to the Semyon Budyonny's First Cavalry Army. First published in the 1920s, the book was one of the Russian people's first literary exposures to the dark, bitter reality of the war. During the 1920s writers of fiction like Babel were given a relatively good degree of freedom compared to the mass censorship and totalitarianism that would follow Joseph Stalin's ascent to power, and certain levels of criticism could even be published. But his works would be withdrawn from sale after 1933 and would not return to bookshelves until after Stalin's death twenty years later. On the advice of Maxim Gorky, the young Babel, his literary career only beginning, set off to join the Soviet Red Cavalry as a war correspondent and propagandist. The violence of Red Cavalry seemed to harshly contrast the gentle nature of the young writer from Odessa. This contrast is also apparent in stories like \\"My First Goose\\", where the narrator, on account of his glasses, must prove himself worthy of his fellow soldiers' camaraderie (and deny his \\"intellectuality\\") by brutally killing a goose and ordering a woman to cook it. Antisemitism is another major theme dealt with in the book. Babel chronicles how both the Red and White Armies, while fighting each other, would also both commit horrible atrocities against the Jews in the old Jewish Pale, leading Gedali, a Jewish shopkeeper, to famously ask, \\"Which is the Revolution and which the counterrevolution?\\" In stories like \\"Gedali\\", the narrator is forced to confront his dual, seemingly contradictory nature as both a Jew and a fighter for the Revolution. The book contains references to actual people who, unbeknownst to Babel at the time, would later emerge as prominent figures in the Soviet Union. These include Semyon Budyonny, Kliment Voroshilov, and Semyon Timoshenko (called \\"Pavlichenko\\" in the book), all of whom would later become Marshals of the Soviet Union and close allies of Stalin with considerable power. Contemporary American writer Denis Johnson cites the book as an important influence for his collection of short stories Jesus' Son, saying dismissively that the collection was \\"a rip-off of Isaac Babel‚Äôs Red Cavalry\\" in an interview with New Yorker Fiction Editor Deborah Treisman.http://www.themillions.com/2015/01/is-jesus-son-a-red-cavalry-rip- off.html Another writer that found inspiration in this work was Frank O'Connor especially in his short story Guests of the Nation.

There is a relationship between areas of the brain associated with perception and mental rotation. There could also be a relationship between the cognitive rate of spatial processing, general intelligence and mental rotation. Mental rotation can be described as the brain moving objects in order to help understand what they are and where they belong. Mental rotation has been studied to try to figure out how the mind recognizes objects in their environment. Researchers generally call such objects stimuli. Mental rotation is one cognitive function for the person to figure out what the altered object is. Mental rotation can be separated into the following cognitive stages: # Create a mental image of an object from all directions (imagining where it continues straight vs. turns). # Rotate the object mentally until a comparison can be made (orientating the stimulus to other figure). # Make the comparison. # Decide if the objects are the same or not. # Report the decision (reaction time is recorded when level pulled or button pushed). Assessment In a mental rotation test, the participant compares two 3D objects (or letters), often rotated in some axis, and states if they are the same image or if they are mirror images (enantiomorphs). Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific number of degrees (e.g. 0¬∞, 60¬∞, 120¬∞ or 180¬∞). A set number of pairs will be split between being the same image rotated, while others are mirrored. The researcher judges the participant on how accurately and rapidly they can distinguish between the mirrored and non-mirrored pairs. Notable research= Shepard and Metzler (1971)  Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) were some of the first to research the phenomenon.Shepard, R. N., & Metzler, J., \\"Mental rotation: Effects of Dimensionality of Objects and Type of Task\\", Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Vol 14, Feb 1988, pp. 3-11. Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. Each subject was presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure how long it would take each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their research showed that the reaction time for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was linearly proportional to the angle of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.  Vandenberg and Kuse (1978)  In 1978, Steven G. Vandenberg and Allan R. Kuse developed a test to assess mental rotation abilities that was based on Shepard and Metzler's (1971) original study. The Mental Rotations Test was constructed using India ink drawings. Each stimulus was a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object drawn by a computer. The image was then displayed on an oscilloscope. Each image was then shown at different orientations rotated around the vertical axis. Following the basic ideas of Shepard and Metzler's experiment, this study found a significant difference in the mental rotation scores between men and women, with men performing better. Correlations with other measures showed strong association with tests of spatial visualization and no association with verbal ability.  Neural activity  In 1999, a study was conducted to find out which part of the brain is activated during mental rotation. Seven volunteers (four males and three females) between the ages of twenty-nine to sixty-six participated in this experiment. For the study, the subjects were shown eight characters 4 times each (twice in normal orientation and twice reversed) and the subjects had to decide if the character was in its normal configuration or if it was the mirror image. During this task, a PET scan was performed and revealed activation in the right posterior parietal lobe. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of brain activation during mental rotation reveal consistent increased activation of the parietal lobe, specifically the inter- parietal sulcus, that is dependent on the difficulty of the task. In general, the larger the angle of rotation, the more brain activity associated with the task. This increased brain activation is accompanied by longer times to complete the rotation task and higher error rates. Researchers have argued that the increased brain activation, increased time, and increased error rates indicate that task difficulty is proportional to the angle of rotation.Rotation in depth 90 degreesRotation in the picture plane 90 degrees Color Physical objects that people imagine rotating in everyday life have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the University of California Santa Barbara was conducted to specifically test the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used several methods such as reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low spatial ability mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators will be more likely to represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh & Hegarty, 2008). Effect on athleticism and artistic ability Research on how athleticism and artistic ability affect mental rotation has also been done. Pietsch, S., & Jansen, P. (2012) showed that people who were athletes or musicians had faster reaction times than people who were not. They tested this by splitting people from the age of 18 and higher into three groups. Group 1 was students who were studying math, sports students and education students. It was found that through the mental rotation test students who were focused on sports did much better than those who were math or education majors. Also it was found that the male athletes in the experiment were faster than females, but male and female musicians showed no significant difference in reaction time. Moreau, D., Clerc, et al. (2012) also investigated if athletes were more spatially aware than non-athletes. This experiment took undergraduate college students and tested them with the mental rotation test before any sport training, and then again afterward. The participants were trained in two different sports to see if this would help their spatial awareness. It was found that the participants did better on the mental rotation test after they had trained in the sports, than they did before the training. There are ways to train your spatial awareness. This experiment brought to the research that if people could find ways to train their mental rotation skills they could perform better in high context activities with greater ease. A study investigated the effect of mental rotation on postural stability. Participants performed a MR (mental rotation) task involving either foot stimuli, hand stimuli, or non-body stimuli (a car) and then had to balance on one foot. The results suggested that MR tasks involving foot stimuli were more effective at improving balance than hand or car stimuli, even after 60 minutes. Researchers studied the difference in mental rotation ability between gymnasts, handball, and soccer players with both in-depth and in-plane rotations. Results suggested that athletes were better at performing mental rotation tasks that were more closely related to their sport of expertise. There is a correlation in mental rotation and motor ability in children, and this connection is especially strong in boys ages 7‚Äì8. Children were known for having very connected motor and cognitive processes, and the study showed that this overlap is influenced by motor ability. A mental rotation test (MRT) was carried out on gymnasts, orienteers, runners, and non athletes. Results showed that non athletes were greatly outperformed by gymnasts and orienteers, but not runners. Gymnasts (egocentric athletes) did not outperform orienteers (allocentric athletes).  Sex  Some studies have shown that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation tasks. In order to explain this difference, brain activation during a mental rotation task was studied. In 2012, a study have been done on people that graduated in sciences or in liberal arts. Males and females were asked to execute a mental rotation task, and their brain activity was recorded with an fMRI. The researchers found a difference of brain activation: males present a stronger activity in the area of the brain used in a mental rotation task. A study from 2008 suggested that differences may occur early during development. The experiment was done on 3- to 4-month-old infants using a 2D mental rotation task. They used a preference apparatus that consists of observing during how much time the infant is looking at the stimulus. They started by familiarizing the participants with the number \\"1\\" and its rotations. Then they showed them a picture of a \\"1\\" rotated and its mirror image. The study showed that males are more interested by the mirror image. Females are equally interested by the \\"1\\" rotated and its mirror image. According to the study, this may mean that males and females, at least when infants, process mental rotation differently. Another study from 2015 was focused on women and their abilities in a mental rotation task and in an emotion recognition task. In this experiment, they induced a feeling or a situation in which women feel more powerful or less powerful. They were able to conclude that women in a situation of power are better in a mental rotation task (but less performant in an emotion recognition task) than other women. Studying differences between male and female brains can have interesting applications. For example, it could help in the understanding of the autism spectrum disorders. One of the theories concerning autism is the EMB (extreme male brain). This theory considers that autist have an \\"extreme male brain\\". In a study from 2015, researchers confirmed that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation task (by studying people without autism): Males are more successful. Then they highlighted the fact that autists do not have this \\"male performance\\" in a mental rotation task. They conclude their study by \\"autistic people do not have an extreme version of a male cognitive profile as proposed by the EMB theory\\". Some recent studies suggest that difference between Mental rotation cognition task are a consequence of procedure and artificiality of the stimuli. A 2017 study leveraged photographs and three-dimensional models, evaluating multiple different approaches and stimuli. Results show that changing the stimuli can eliminate any male advantages found from the Vandenberg and Kuse test (1978). Current research directions There may be relationships between competent bodily movement and the speed with which individuals can perform mental rotation. Researchers found children who trained with mental rotation tasks had improved strategy skills after practicing. Follow-ups studies will compare the differences in the brain among the attempts to discover effects on other tasks and the brain. People use many different strategies to complete tasks; psychologists will study participants who use specific cognitive skills to compare competency and reaction times. Others will continue to examine the differences in competency of mental rotation based on the objects being rotated. Participants' identification with the object could hinder or help their mental rotation abilities across gender and ages to support the earlier claim that males have faster reaction times. Psychologists will continue to test similarities between mental rotation and physical rotation, examining the difference in reaction times and relevance to environmental implications.

Natural history JSRV is the virus that is the cause of the contagious lung tumors in sheep called ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). The disease has also been called \\"jaagsiekte\\", after the Afrikaans words for \\"chase\\" (jaag) and \\"sickness\\" (siekte), to describe the respiratory distress observed in an animal out of breath from being chased, indicating the breathing difficulty experienced by infected sheep. Transmission of virus is through aerosol spread between sheep. The exogenous infectious form of JSRV has an endogenous counterpart which is present in the genomes of all sheep and goats. The sheep genome has around 27 copies of endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) that are closely related to JSRV. Endogenous JSRV has several roles in the evolution of the domestic sheep as they are able to block the JSRV replication cycle and play a critical role in sheep conceptus development and placental morphogenesis. Although OPA resembles human lung cancer, human lung cancer is not known to be caused by betaretroviruses. Even though a possibility of a viral cause has been eliminated in bronchoalveolar cancer, understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to the transformation of lung epithelia by JSRV may be of interest in the context of therapeutic approaches in human lung cancers in general and bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma (BAC) in particular. Classification JSRV belongs to the family Retroviridae, to the subfamily Orthoretrovirinae and the genus Betaretrovirus. Pathogenesis JSRV is transmitted by the respiratory route and may also infect lymphocytes and myeloid cells, in addition to the lung epithelia. Expression of the JSRV Envelope protein activates signalling cascades that promote cellular proliferation and malignant transformation of the cells. Initially, the tumour cells grow along the alveolar walls in a pattern reminiscent of human BAC, but subsequently become more invasive and metastasize to the local lymph nodes. Larger tumours may be necrotic and fibromatous at their centre. As the tumour grows, fluid production in the lung increases and this is likely to promote virus spread to other sheep. Only when the tumour reaches a size large enough to compromise lung function, do clinical signs appear. Critically, the majority of infected animals in endemic areas never show outward signs of infection, but they may be shedding virus, thus promoting inadvertent introduction of the disease into previously unaffected flocks and new geographical areas. Genome structure The genome of the exogenous virus is 7462 bases and has the classical \\"gag\\", \\"pol\\", \\"env\\" genome arrangement and is flanked by a long terminal repeat (LTR) on each end. There are 4 genes that encode the viral structural proteins. They are \\"gag\\" encoding the structural internal virion proteins comprising \\"matrix\\" (MA), \\"capsid\\" (CA) and \\"nucleocapsid\\"(NC); \\"pro\\", which encodes an aspartic protease (PR); \\"pol\\", which encodes the\\" RT\\" and \\"integrase\\"(IN) enzymes; and \\"env\\", which encodes the \\"surface\\" (SU) and \\"transmembrane\\" (TM) envelope glycoproteins. The viral proteins are synthesized initially as large precursors and are later processed into the mature proteins by proteolytic cleavage. An additional open reading frame (ORF) was observed in the viral genome and has been called orfX and its function is undefined. Replication cycle The initial attachment of JSRV to its target cell is mediated through the binding of the SU subunit of the Env glycoprotein to a specific cell surface receptor molecule,\\"Hyal2\\". The entry of the JSRV core into the cytoplasm activates reverse transcription, during which the single-stranded RNA genome is converted into a double-stranded DNA form and gets integrated as a provirus into the host. Following integration, expression of JSRV RNA from the viral promoter in the LTR is controlled by the host transcriptional machine. Following transcription and translation of the viral genome, the new progeny virus gets assembled at the plasma membrane and bud off from the host cell acquiring a lipid envelope and their \\"env\\" glycoproteins. Following release from the cell, the \\"Gag\\"-\\"Pro\\"-\\"Pol\\" polyproteins are cleaved into their mature forms by protease. This step maturation is essential for the formation of infectious particles. Receptor and entry The cellular receptor for JSRV is hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2), a glycophosphatidylinol(GPI)-anchored protein belonging to the hyaluronidase family. Generally, oncogenic retroviruses cause transformation of host cells mostly by insertional activation of a host protooncogene into an oncogene. But JSRV is different in this aspect since its envelope glycoprotein (\\"env\\") by itself is an oncogene and this single protein was shown to be necessary and sufficient to induce lung tumors in sheep. Unlike the majority of retroviruses, JSRV entry into the host cell is pH-dependent. Thus oncogenic JSRV has borrowed features of both pH-dependent and pH-independent viruses for entry which involves both the receptor binding and a low pH for fusion transformation of host cells. Host immune response An important feature of JSRV infection is the absence of any specific immune response from the host. A likely explanation is that the sheep are immunologically tolerant to JSRV antigens due to the expression of closely related endogenous JSRV proteins in the fetal thymus during T lymphocyte development and any JSRV-reactive T cells should be recognized as ‚Äòanti-self‚Äô and selectively removed. Another hypothesis is that tumor cells downregulate their major histocompatibility class-I expression, possibly being the reason for the absence of any virus- specific cytotoxic T cell response (CTL).  Endogenous jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus  A diagram explaining the process of integration of viral DNA into the host genome During evolution, the sheep genome incorporated parts of the Jaagksiete sheep retrovirus, now known as endogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (enJSRV). There are 27 known copies of enJSRV in the sheep genome, of which five show intact sequences found in all retroviruses. These seem to have been adopted by the sheep genome as enJSRV aids placental development and provides protection against similar retroviruses. In vitro assays have found that enJSRV does this by blocking various stages of the viral replication cycle. An example of this protection is seen in ovine endometrial epithelium where the high expression of enJSVR prevents exogenous JSVR from entering the cells via blocking the common receptor to both, HYAL2. However, Jaagsiekte virus can sometimes mutate to overcome this protection, and there is evidence of this having occurred in the last 200 years. There is also indication that the endogenization of Jaagsiekte virus is still occurring today.  enJSRV mechanism in reproduction  An image of a lamb In sheep, enJSRVs are highly expressed in the epithelia lining different reproductive tissues, including the vagina, uterus and oviduct. The RNA of enJSRVs is first detected in the conceptus on day 12. Experiments have found that the enJSRV envelope regulates trophoblast growth and differentiation within the peri-implantation conceptus. It was discovered that enJSRVs are expressed in the trophectoderm cells of the placenta. Their expression coincides with the key events of conceptus elongation and onset of trophoblast giant binucleate cells (BNC) differentiation. Furthermore, it was observed that an injection of morpholinos (an enJSRV envelope production inhibitor) into the uteri of pregnant sheep on day 8 of pregnancy resulted in reduced conceptus elongation and inhibition of trophoblast giant BNC differentiation. Elongation of the sheep conceptus is an essential process as it results in the production of interferon tau (IFNT) which is a pregnancy recognition signal required for conceptus survival. This stimulates both the corpus luteum to continue to secrete progesterone and the onset of implantation. Following the injection of morpholinos, it was observed that pregnancy loss occurred 12 days later. This work supports the hypothesis that enJSRVs are crucial in sheep reproduction and placental morphogenesis. = HYAL2 = Hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) serves as a cell-surface receptor for both the exogenous and endogenous JSRV envelope (env). HYAL2 mRNA can be detected in the BNCs and multinucleated syncytia of sheep placentomes during pregnancy, but not in the trophectoderm cells or any cells of the endometrium. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that HYAL2 mRNA was only detected in the binucleate cells and multi-nucleated syncytial plaques. It is hypothesised that enJSRV interactions with HYAL2 are vital for placental growth and differentiation. Whilst the cellular and molecular mechanism are still unclear, it is apparent it has a role in protecting the uterus against viral infection and placental morphogenesis. The co-expression of the enJSRV envelope and HYAL2 in the same cell types supports the hypothesis that HYAL2 binds to enJSRVs env on the binucleate cells and promotes their fusion into multi-nucleated syncytia.  Comparative physiology in humans and mice  Of interest for comparative physiology is that the presence of enJSRV envelope protein expression in the developing sheep placenta is very similar to that observed for syncytin in humans and the mouse. During the formation of the human placenta syncytiotrophoblast, by fusion of mononuclear cytotrophoblasts, human syncytins are specifically expressed. The syncytins are fusogenic when expressed in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that they are involved in placental morphogenesis. These observations support the theory that an ancient retroviral infection had important consequences for mammalian evolution. The involvement of the betaretrovirus enJSRV in the sheep conceptus trophoblasts further argues for its involvment in sheep placentation.  Future directions and summary  Research surrounding endogenous retroviruses supports the idea that they may play critical roles in conceptus growth, placental differentiation and cell fusion in mammals. The morphological aspects of binucleate cell differentiation in ruminants such as sheep are well characterised, but the mechanisms are not well defined - though evidence shows that enJSRV RNA and HYAL2 mRNA are co-expressed in the binucleate cell and multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts throughout gestation.

The ward population (called Stanwix Urban) had a population taken at the 2011 census of 5,934. It is located on the north side of River Eden, across from Carlisle city centre. Although long counted as a suburb it did not officially become part of the city until 1912 when part of the civil parish of Stanwix became part of the parish, city and municipal borough of Carlisle. Further areas were added to the city, which was by then a county borough, in 1934 and 1951. The remaining part of the parish was eventually renamed Stanwix Rural in 1966. Etymology 'Stanwix' means \\" 'stone wall(s)', v. 'steinn', 'veggr'... The stone walls of Congavata...gave rise to the name.\\" 'Steinn' and 'veggr' are Old Norse. Congavata was the name of the Roman fort at what became Drumburgh- by-Sands on the Solway Firth; however, it was Petriana that gave rise to the name of Stanwix. Location Stanwix is built on the site of a Roman fort known as Uxelodunum or Petriana. This was the largest fort on Hadrian's Wall, which adjoined the northwest edge of the fort. St Michael's Church, Stanwix The former village of Stanwix was centred on its church of St Michael's church website at the top of a steep bank rising from the river Eden, close to the junction of the main road north (now the A7) with the road to the east (now the B6264). In the mid nineteenth century the district grew with many large houses built for Carlisle's expanding middle classes. Today Stanwix includes the areas of Edentown, Whiteclosegate, St Anne's Hill and Belah. Notable buildings Near the church today is a small parade of shops and other businesses. Morrisons and Aldi supermarkets and a Sainsbury's Local store are located in the area as well. A little further north at Kingstown is a large Asda superstore. The University of Cumbria has a campus on Brampton Road (formerly the main campus of the Cumbria Institute of the Arts). There is also a Roman Catholic private school called Austin Friars St Monica's School located at St. Anne's Hill. The course of Hadrian's Wall runs through the suburb, and the area around the church is built on the site of the fort of Uxelodunum. A single bridge, the grade I listed Eden Bridge designed by Robert Smirke, crosses the River Eden to connect Stanwix and other northern reaches of the district to Carlisle city centre. Numerous households in low-lying areas in Stanwix were badly affected by the flooding of the River Eden during the Carlisle Floods of January 2005. The main road running northwards through Stanwix is Scotland Road, and until 2012 had the dubious distinction of carrying the same daily volume of traffic as the nearby M6 motorway. In 2012 the \\"northern relief road\\" opened, around the north-west of Carlisle, which should ease congestion.

She played an important role in the succession crisis in Denmark in the first half of the 19th century. Life Charlotte of Denmark She was born in Christiansborg Palace to Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway, and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. On 10 November 1810 in Amalienborg Palace she married Prince William of Hesse- Kassel. Her spouse was in Danish service from his youth, and the family lived in Denmark. Princess Charlotte was described as a wise, practical and thrifty, and kept the finances of her household under strict control. Dansk biografisk Lexikon / III. Bind. Brandt - Clavus (in Danish) She had some interest in art and poetry, and reportedly felt herself to be a Danish patriot.Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1933-44 Charlotte played some part in the succession crisis which occurred because her cousin, King Frederick, lacked a male heir. She supported the solution that her branch of the family should succeed to the throne, and because of this, she opposed the Schleswig-Holstein matter.Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1933-44 In 1839, her brother Christian VIII of Denmark succeeded their cousin on the throne, and during his reign, Charlotte had an important position at the Danish royal court in Copenhagen because her brother favored that her line of the family should succeed to the throne after his male line had died out.Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1933-44 In 1848, her brother died and was succeeded by his childless son, her nephew. In 1850, the Danish government was pressured by the Empire of Russia to discontinue its support of her line in the succession order in favor of the Duke of Oldenburg, her son- in-law. Christian of Oldenburg had displayed anti-Danish sentiment during the recent war, and when gehejmer√•d F.C. Dankwart, on behalf of the government, issued the demand that she should renounce her and her son's right to the throne in favor of her son-in-law, she replied: \\"It is impossible: the Danish people would under no circumstance accept as King a Prince from a house that has made war against Denmark, and that is so hostile toward us\\".Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1933-44 In exchange, she demanded that the House of Oldenburg purchase the Duchy of Hesse and declare it a kingdom, so that her son Frederick could \\"Switch one Kingdom for another\\".Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1933-44 After having been persuaded that her terms were impossible and that Christian of Oldenburg in fact had good support for his claim, she agreed to renounce her and her son's claims to the throne.Dansk Biografisk Leksikon, 1933-44 On 18 July 1851, she and her son Frederick renounced their claims to the Danish throne in favour of her daughter Louise, who in turn renounced it in favour of her spouse.

It is located on the fourth floor of the John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers University-Newark in Newark, New Jersey. The archival collection contains more than 100,000 sound recordings on CDs, LPs, EPs, 78- and 75-rpm disks, and 6,000 books. It also houses over 30 instruments used by prominent jazz musicians. In 2013, the Institute was designated a Literary Landmark by New Jersey's Center for the Book in the National Registry of the Library of Congress. It is the fifth place in New Jersey to be given this designation, after the Newark Public Library, Paterson Public Library, the Walt Whitman House and the Joyce Kilmer Tree, which is located at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Major collections housed in the Institute include the Jazz Oral History Project, the Mary Lou Williams collection, the Women In Jazz collection, the Benny Carter Audio collection, and the Benny Goodman Audio collection. History In 1952, the Institute of Jazz Studies was founded by Marshall Stearns, a jazz scholar, literature professor, and author. Stearns had a plan for a jazz institute as early as 1949, which he thought to call the \\"Institute of Modern American Music\\". It was originally located at his apartment at 108 Waverly Place in New York City. Marshall Stearns described the Institute of Jazz Studies' mission in 1953 as the following: Stearns negotiated transfer of IJS to Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey in 1966. He died before the final transfer took place. In 1967 the Institute materials were moved to the Newark campus of Rutgers University in New Jersey. Charles Nanry, a sociologist, worked part-time as its administrator. It was first located in the Dana Library (1972), then moved to Bradley Hall (1975). The Institute was formally affiliated with the John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers ‚Äì Newark in 1984. The current expanded facilities in the library opened in 1994. Over its 60 years of existence, the Institute has acquired significant collections of periodicals as well as books, records, and archival materials from several musicians, photographers, and journalists. Major collections include the personal papers of Mary Lou Williams, Victoria Spivey, Abbey Lincoln, Annie Ross, Benny Carter, and James P. Johnson. Publications A special column in The Record Changer jazz magazine was the initial, temporary place of publication for the Institute of Jazz Studies scholarship. The Journal of Jazz Studies (JJS) was published from 1973 to 1979. Annual Review of Jazz Studies (ARJS) publication began in 1981 as a continuation of JJS. Today, the Journal of Jazz Studies is an open-access online journal. The online journal continues and expands upon the tradition of the original JJS/ARJS as the longest running English-language scholarly jazz journal. It is open-access and peer-reviewed. Studies in Jazz, a monograph series with Scarecrow Press, publishes books related to jazz. Events and scholarship In addition to its publications, the Institute also hosts \\"Jazz From The Archives\\", a radio show on WBGO radio that airs every Sunday and a Jazz Research Roundtable. Jazz Archives fellowship Since 2012, the Institute has also hosted an annual Jazz Archives Fellowship. The fellowship is open to graduate students of library science or recent graduates with an interest in jazz or African American studies. It is supported by the Morroe Berger - Benny Carter Jazz Research Fund, an endowment established by musician Benny Carter in 1987 to provide grants to facilitate jazz research by students and scholars. The Fellowship Program is also funded by private funds. In 2014, the fellows focused on the collection of Ismay Duvivier, a dancer, and her son George Duvivier, a bass player. Morroe Berger ‚Äì Benny Carter Jazz Research Fund In 1987, the Institute began funding up to ten grants of $1,000 each year. The fund was started by musician Benny Carter in memory of Morroe Berger. Berger was a professor of sociology at Princeton University until his death in 1981. Half of the awards are designated for students in the Rutgers- Newark Master's Program in Jazz History and Research and half are awarded to scholars from other institutions. The awards are for visiting the Institute and performing independent jazz-related research. To date, over 70 awards have been granted. Original Board of Advisers * Louis Armstrong * Philip W.

Childhood Gross was born to a Jewish family in Austrian Galicia, in the village of Wolowa (now known as Mezhgorye, Ukraine), in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1911, his family moved to Kolomyia (which was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR in 1939 and became part of newly independent Ukraine in 1991). During World War I, Russian forces invaded Austria-Hungary; amidst the turmoil, the Grosses fled Kolomyia. They returned when Austria retook the town in 1915, refugees of the war. When World War I ended, Gross and brother Avrom- Leib went to Budapest to join their older siblings Sarah and Pinkas. Gross applied to and was accepted by the art academy in Budapest and studied under the painter B√©la Uitz, though within a year a new regime under Mikl√≥s Horthy took over and attempted to expel all Jews and foreigners from the country. After being deported from Hungary, Gross began art studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, Austria shortly before immigrating to the United States in 1921. Emigration from Austria to U.S. Gross' brother Naftoli had arrived in New York City in 1914. He sent money to his brothers Chaim and Avrom-Lieb, who traveled from Vienna to Le Havre, France, where they took a boat to New York City in March 1921. Early Career 1921-1933 Gross's studies continued in the United States at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where he studied with Elie Nadelman and others, and at the Art Students League of New York, with Robert Laurent. He also attended the Educational Alliance Art School, studying under Abbo Ostrowsky, at the same time as Moses Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Adolph Gottlieb, and Peter Blume. In 1926 Gross began teaching at The Educational Alliance, and continued teaching there for the next 50 years. Louise Nevelson was among his students at the Alliance (in 1934), during the time she was transitioning from painting to sculpture. Gross began exhibiting sculpture in group shows of students at the Educational Alliance, and then at the Jewish Art Center in the Bronx. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he exhibited at the Salons of America exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and, beginning in 1928, at the Whitney Studio Club (the precursor to the Whitney Museum of American Art). In 1929, Gross experimented with printmaking, and created an important group of 15 linocuts and lithographs of landscapes, New York City streets and parks, women in interiors, the circus, and vaudeville. The entire suite is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Gross returned to the medium of printmaking in the 1960s, and produced approximately 200 works in the medium over the next two decades. In March 1932 Gross had his first solo exhibition at Gallery 144 in New York City. For a short time they represented Gross, as well as his friends Milton Avery, Moses Soyer, Ahron Ben-Shmuel and others. Gross was primarily a practitioner of the direct carving method, with the majority of his work being carved from wood. Other direct carvers in early 20th-century American art include William Zorach, Jose de Creeft, and Robert Laurent. Works by Chaim Gross can be found in major museums and private collections throughout the United States, with substantial holdings (27 sculptures) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. A key work from this era, now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is the 1932 birds-eye maple Acrobatic Performers, which is also only one and one quarter inch thick. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Maturity 1933-1957 In 1933 Gross joined the government's PWAP (Public Works of Art Project), which transitioned into the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which Gross worked for later in the 1930s. Under these programs Gross taught and demonstrated art, made sculptures that were placed in schools and public colleges, made work for Federal buildings including the Federal Trade Commission Building, and for the France Overseas and Finnish Buildings at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Gross was also recognized during these years with a silver medal at the Exposition universelle de 1937 in Paris, and in 1942, with a purchase prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \\"Artists for Victory\\" exhibition for his wood sculpture of famed circus performer Lillian Leitzel. In 1938 filmmaker and historian Lewis Jacobs made a 30-minute feature of Gross carving, called Tree Trunk to Head, showing Gross at work in his East Village studio on a portrait of his wife Renee, who models in the film. In 1949 Gross sketched Chaim Weizmann, President of Israel, at several functions in New York City where Weizmann was speaking. Gross began a portrait in clay and then traveled to Israel in the summer of that year hoping to be able to meet Weizmann and have him sit for a portrait. Weizmann was too ill, but Gross completed the bust in bronze later that year. Gross returned to Israel for three months in 1951 (the second of many trips there in the postwar years) to paint a series of 40 watercolors of life in various cities. This series was exhibited at the Jewish Museum (Manhattan) in 1953. Chaim Gross, Sculptor by Josef Vincent Lombardo, the first major book on Gross, came out in 1949. It included a catalogue raisonne of his sculpture. In the 1950s Gross began to make more bronze sculptures alongside his wood and stone pieces, and in 1957 and 1959 he traveled to Rome to work with famed bronze foundries including the Nicci foundry. At the end of the decade Gross was working primarily in bronze, which allowed him to create open forms, large-scale works and of course, multiple casts. Gross's large-scale bronze The Family, donated to New York City in 1991 in honor of Mayor Ed Koch, and installed at the Bleecker Street Park at 11th street, is now a fixture of Greenwich Village. Later Career 1957-1991 In 1957, Gross published The Techniques of Wood Sculpture, an influential how-to book with photographs of him at work by famed photographer Eliot Elisofon. In 1959, a survey of Gross's sculpture in wood, stone, and bronze was featured in the exhibit Four American Expressionists curated by Lloyd Goodrich at the Whitney Museum of American Art, with work by Abraham Rattner, Doris Caesar, and Karl Knaths. In 1963, Gross and his family moved from their longtime residence at 30 W. 105th Street to Greenwich Village, following the purchase of a four-story historic townhouse and studio at 526 LaGuardia Place. The townhouse is now the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, winner of a 2015 Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, and open to the public. This is the Historic Plaque unveiled on October 6, 2016 by Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation at 526 LaGuardia Place. In 1974, the Smithsonian American Art Museum held the exhibition, Chaim Gross: Sculpture and Drawings, organized by Janet A. Flint, Smithsonian Curator of Prints and Drawings. In 1976, a selection from Gross's important collection of historic African sculpture, formed since the late 1930s, was exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum in the show The Sculptor's Eye: The African Art Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Gross. In 1977, Gross had three retrospective exhibitions: at the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami, followed by the Montclair Art Museum; and the Jewish Museum (Manhattan). The Jewish Museum's exhibition catalog featured an important essay on Gross by art historian and modern American sculpture specialist Roberta K. Tarbell, Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University. Gross received multiple honorary doctorates in the 1970s and 80s: from Franklin and Marshall College (1970); Yeshiva University (1978); Adelphi University (1980); Hebrew Union College (1984); and Brooklyn College (1986). In 1979 Gross was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1981. In 1984, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, with Jacob Lawrence and Lukas Foss. Gross died at Beth Israel Hospital in May 1991 and was buried at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Queens, New York. In the fall of 1991, Allen Ginsberg gave an important tribute to Gross at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which is published in their Proceedings. In 1994, Forum Gallery, which now represents the Chaim Gross estate, held a memorial exhibition featuring a sixty-year survey of Gross's work. Teaching Gross was a professor of printmaking and sculpture at both the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research in New York City, as well as at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, the MoMA art school, the Art Student's League and the New Art School (which Gross ran briefly with Alexander Dobkin, Raphael Soyer and Moses Soyer). Gross was a member of the New York Artists Equity Association and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. He was a founder and served as the first president of the Sculptors Guild. Personal life In 1932 Gross married Renee Nechin (d. 2005), and they had two children, Yehuda and Mimi. Mimi Gross is a New York- based artist. She was married to the artist Red Grooms from 1963-1976.

He was known as the \\"Shaking Hand of Dublin\\". Early life The second of seven children, he was the son of Thomas Byrne, an engineer, and Fanny Dowman. His childhood home was at 36 Seville Place, a terraced house with five rooms just off the North Strand in Dublin. Byrne dropped out of school at the age of 13, and was soon juggling jobs as a grocer's assistant and a bicycle mechanic. Eventually he used his savings to buy a pub on Talbot Street. He married Elizabeth Heagney in 1910. Early political career Alfie Byrne buying a newspaper Byrne became an Alderman on Dublin Corporation in 1914. He was a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, a significant position for a politician from the Dublin Harbour constituency. In the records of the Oireachtas his occupation is given as company director. He was elected as MP for Dublin Harbour in a by-election on 1 October 1915, as a candidate of the Irish Parliamentary Party. and later to D√°il √âireann as an Independent in favour of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Without the benefit of a party machine, he soon realised that attending to constituents' needs was the only sure way to retain his seat. In several elections he secured more votes than any other politician in the country.Anne Dolan, \\"Alfred 'Alfie' Byrne\\". Dictionary of Irish Biography, ed. by Aidan Clarke, Ronan Fanning, K. Theodore Hoppen, Edith Mary Johnston-Liik, James McGuire, Maureen Murphy, and James Quinn, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 202 His personal archive, which is on view in The Little Museum of Dublin, includes many letters from men who thought that he could find them a wife. The Easter Rising in 1916 was followed by the rapid decline of the Irish Parliamentary Party and the rise of Sinn F√©in, even in the formerly immensely safe Dublin Harbour constituency. At the general election in 1918 Byrne was defeated by a Sinn F√©in candidate, Philip Shanahan. Following the establishment of the Irish Free State Byrne was elected as an Independent TD for the Dublin Mid constituency at the general election to the Third D√°il in 1922. From 1923 to 1928 he represented Dublin North. He was an elected member of Seanad √âireann, for a six-year term from 1928. He vacated his D√°il seat on 4 December 1928. He resigned from the Seanad on 10 December 1931, and returned to the D√°il in 1932. He remained a TD until his death in 1956, representing Dublin North (1932‚Äì37) and Dublin North-East (1937‚Äì56). Lord Mayor (1930‚Äì39) Byrne on O'Connell Bridge Byrne was elected as Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1930, serving in the post for nine consecutive years. When cycling or walking around the city he dispensed lollipops to children, who were often seen chasing him down the street. With a handshake and a few words for all, his eternal canvassing soon earned him the first of his nicknames: the Shaking Hand of Dublin. Married with eight children, Byrne treated the people of Dublin as his second family. Every morning he would find up to fifty people waiting for him in the Mansion House. None had appointments. All were met. Byrne answered 15,000 letters in his first year as Lord Mayor.\\"Busiest Man in Ireland\\". The People. 1 February 1931. Many were from Dubliners looking for a job, a house, some advice or a reference. One morning in 1931 a journalist watched the Lord Mayor attend to his correspondence. Within an hour he accepted \\"seventeen invitations to public dinners, one invitation to a public entertainment and eight invitations to public functions.\\" Then he dictated forty-three sympathetic letters to men and women looking for employment. In 1937, children between the ages of eight and eleven years old were being sentenced to spend up to five years in Industrial Schools. Their crime was stealing a few apples from an orchard. When Byrne said such sentences were \\"savage,\\" a judge responded with a defence of the Industrial School system, urging an end to \\"ridiculous Mansion House mummery.\\"\\"Justices Will Probe Lord Mayor's 'Savage Sentences' Allegations\\". Daily Express. 23 October 1937. Byrne stood firm: \\"For the punishment of trifling offences the home of the children is better than any institution.\\"\\"Lord Mayor's Reply to Criticism of Speech: Courts and Children\\". The Irish Press. 7 April 1937. In 1938, Byrne was favoured by the press for the presidency of Ireland, a ceremonial role created in the new Constitution, but he was outgunned by the political establishment.\\"¬£15,000 a year\\". Evening Standard (London). 8 April 1938. Relations with the United States and the United Kingdom The Lord Mayor Leaves New York When, in 1935, Byrne became the first Lord Mayor of Dublin to visit North America in 40 years, he was granted the freedom of Toronto, and The New York Times hailed the arrival of a \\"champion showman.\\" Byrne often extended a hand of friendship to Britain. He also improved relations between Dublin (until recently the centre of British authority) and the rest of the country. One night Dublin Fire Brigade got an urgent call for assistance from Clones.\\"Lord Mayor of Dublin Cheered at Clones\\". The Weekly Irish Times. 23 October 1937. As Lord Mayor, Byrne felt obliged to join the men on top of the fire engine as they set off on the 85-mile journey in the middle of the night. Anti-communist connections In August 1936, Byrne addressed the inaugural meeting of the anti-communist Irish Christian Front, some of whose members later expressed anti-Semitic views. In 1938, as lord mayor, he presented a gift of a replica of the Ardagh Chalice to Italian naval cadets visiting Dublin on board two warships, who had been welcomed by the Irish government despite the protests of Dubliners. A photograph exists of Byrne giving a fascist salute along with Eoin O'Duffy, commander of the Blueshirts, around 1933.Irish fascist leader Eoin O'Duffy at a rally of his Blueshirts. To his right is Alfred Byrne, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Getty Images. Final term as Lord Mayor (1954) In 1954, Byrne was elected as Lord Mayor for a record tenth time.

He served four terms in Congress from 1913 through 1921 and is credited with bringing many U.S. Navy facilities to San Diego.  Biography  Kettner was born in 1864 in Ann Arbor, Michigan to John F. and Frederika Kettner, both German immigrants. His parents moved to St. Paul, Minnesota in 1873. His father died when he was 13, so he had to leave school to work, first as a bell boy, then he drove a dray horse. He came to San Diego when he was 21, in the middle of an economic boom in the late 1880s, and worked various odd jobs around the state. In 1893 he married Ida B. Griffs in Visalia, California and went into the real estate and insurance business there. The couple divorced in 1904. Kettner married Marion Morgan in 1905, and they lived in Visalia until moving to San Diego in 1907. William Kettner set up an insurance business, and later became involved with real estate and banking. The next year the city was visited by the U.S. Navy's Great White Fleet - its first U.S. stop on a round-the-world cruise. Kettner was inspired by the visit and volunteered to organize the city's reception festivities for the fleet. He then became a member of the board of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, and served as its Director. Kettner was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1912. Although he was a Democrat and Republicans had traditionally represented the district, he was supported by many Republicans, including the conservative San Diego Union, because of his popularity with the Chamber of Commerce and the turmoil in the national Republican party caused by Theodore Roosevelt's split of the party into \\"stand-patters\\" and Progressives. Republicans used the slogan \\"Why not Kettner?\\" Kettner won by 3,500 votes. He was re-elected in 1914 by 24,000 votes; in 1916 by 9,000 votes; and in 1918 when he ran unopposed. He stepped down as congressman in 1920 due to poor health and a financial downturn with his insurance business. During his four terms in Congress, 1913-1921, he spent much effort bringing Naval bases to San Diego. His first accomplishment, achieved by lobbying even before he was sworn in as a member of Congress, was a federal appropriation to dredge San Diego Bay to allow large ships to enter. He continued to promote San Diego and Southern California interests (the Congressional district then encompassed ten counties) throughout his tenure. Kettner won friends easily with his warm personality and addressed colleagues as \\"brother\\", earning him the nickname of \\"Brother Bill\\" in San Diego and Washington. He courted many congressmen and officials, lobbying them over dinner and gifting them with California produce such as oranges and wine. He became friends with Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt visited San Diego during the 1915 Panama-California Exposition and came away impressed with the area's potential as a Navy base. He helped Kettner's efforts to establish bases in San Diego as assistant Naval secretary and later as President. By the time Kettner retired from Congress in 1921, he had secured many Naval bases, including Camp Kearny on the site which is now Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, the Broadway Naval Supply Depot, the 32nd Street Naval Station, San Diego Naval Hospital, Naval Training Center San Diego, and Naval Air Station North Island. The military later became for a time the largest employer in San Diego County. Kettner was nicknamed the \\"Million Dollar Congressman\\" for his ability to gain Naval bases in San Diego. Kettner died in San Diego in 1930 and is buried at Greenwood Memorial Park, beside his mother, who died in 1912. In 1919 the fireboat Bill Kettner, in use until 1961, was named in his honor. In 1930, San Diego's Arctic Street was renamed Kettner Boulevard to honor him.  Quote Notes Other references  * . Compiled by Mary B. Steyle.

The work of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), suggests that the Chernobyl incident cannot be directly compared to atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons through a single number, with one being simply times larger than the other. This is partly due to the fact that the isotopes released at Chernobyl tended to be longer-lived than those released by the detonation of atomic bombs. The economic damage caused by the disaster is estimated at $235 billion. Radiation effects on humans According to a 2009 United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), the Chernobyl accident had by 2005 caused 61,200 man-Sv of radiation exposure to recovery workers and evacuees, 125,000 man-Sv to the populace of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, and a dose to most of the more distant European countries amounting to 115,000 man-Sv. The same report estimated a further 25% more exposure would be received from residual radiosotopes after 2005. The total global collective dose from Chernobyl was earlier estimated by UNSCEAR in 1988 to be \\"600,000 man Sv, equivalent on average to 21 additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation.\\" Dose to the general public within 30 km of the plant The inhalation dose (internal dose) for the public during the time of the accident and their evacuation from the area in what is now the 30 km evacuation zone around the plant has been estimated (based on ground deposition of caesium-137) to be between 3 and 150 mSv. Thyroid doses for adults around the Chernobyl area were estimated to be between 20 and 1000 mSv, while for one-year-old infants, these estimates were higher, at 20 to 6000 mSv. For those who left at an early stage after the accident, the internal dose due to inhalation was 8 to 13 times higher than the external dose due to gamma/beta emitters. For those who remained until later (day 10 or later), the inhalation dose was 50 to 70% higher than the dose due to external exposure. The majority of the dose was due to iodine-131 (about 40%) and tellurium and rubidium isotopes (about 20 to 30% for Rb and Te). The ingestion doses in this same group of people have also been estimated using the cesium activity per unit of area, isotope ratios, an average day of evacuation, intake rate of milk and green vegetables, and what is known about the transfer of radioactivity via plants and animals to humans. For adults, the dose has been estimated to be between 3 and 180 mSv, while for one-year-old infants, a dose of between 20 and 1300 mSv has been estimated. Again, the majority of the dose was thought to be mostly due to iodine-131.  Childhood exposure  Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Russia received substantial amounts of radiation exposure after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, but prior to the disaster the number of children affected by thyroid cancer was relatively low globally. Every year about, \\"0.1‚Äì2.2 individuals per million of all aged under 15 years old world wide\\" were affected by thyroid cancer. Research has shown after the Chernobyl disaster the level of thyroid cancer, particularly in children near the radiation exposure, has abnormally increased.Bennett, B., Repacholi, M., & Carr, Z. (2006). Health effects of the Chernobyl accident and special health care programs. In Report of the UN Chernobyl Forum Expert Group ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù. Geneva: World Health Organization. Although iodine-131 has a relatively short half-life compared to other radioactive isotopes, iodine-131 made its way through the food chain through a milk-to-consumer pathway. 95% of iodine-131 was ingested through milk shortly after the disaster. Communities were unaware of the contamination deposited in soil and the transforming capabilities of radiation into other food sources. Through the consumption of milk, children received abnormal amounts of radiation exposure. The high absorption rate discovered in children has also shown to be inversely proportional to age.National Research Council Staff, Institute of Medicine Staff, National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Exposure of the American People to I-131 from the Nevada Atomic Bomb Tests, & Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Thyroid Screening Related to I-131 Exposure. (1999). There is a high rate of thyroid cancer among children less than 15 years old who were exposed to the radiation after the disaster and an increasing level of dosage as age decreases. This inverse proportion could be explained by the way in which children absorb iodine-131. Children have smaller thyroid glands compared to adults and have a different dosage response after the ingestion of iodine-131. A cohort study conducted in 2013 discovered a similar trend between age and dosage response. The cohort was composed of 12,000 participants, all of which were exposed to the radiation in Belarus and reported to be under the age of 18 at the time of the exposure.  Future study  Studying the populations that were exposed to radiation after the Chernobyl accident has provided important data linking exposure to radiation and the future development of cancer. Cases of pediatric thyroid cancer, likely caused by absorption of Iodine-131 into the thyroid gland, increased in Ukraine and Belarus 3 to 4 years after the accident. Children were most at risk, and cases did not seem to increase in adults. The greatest increase was seen in children who were the youngest at the time of exposure, and most of the pediatric thyroid cases were reported in Gomel, Belarus, where the population was exposed to the highest levels of contamination. The majority of the cases that appeared in the exposed population were papillary thyroid cancer. Before the accident, the rate of thyroid cancer in children in Belarus was less than 1 per million. By 1995, nine years after the disaster, the number of cases of pediatric thyroid cancer in Gomel Oblast rose to 100 per million per year. Even as adults those who were exposed to the radiation as children may still be at risk of developing thyroid cancer decades after the exposure. It is important to study the at risk population throughout their lives, and observe if different patterns arise in tumors that develop with longer latency. A group of experts who are part of the Agenda for Research on Chernobyl Health (ARCH) have proposed a series of potential studies that would examine the continued effects from the Chernobyl accident, and provide more information on the full extent of related health consequences. Results from lifelong observation of the exposed population could provide more information on risks as well as future protection against radiation exposure. Short-term health effects and immediate results The explosion at the power station and subsequent fires inside the remains of the reactor resulted in the development and dispersal of a radioactive cloud which drifted not only over Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, but also over most of Europe and as far as Canada.Chernobyl: country by country A - H. Davistownmuseum.org. Retrieved 26 April 2012. (page 3) Map of radioactive cloud with flash animation, French IRSN (Institut de Radioprotection et de S√ªret√© Nucl√©aire ‚Äî Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety) In fact, the initial evidence in other countries that a major release of radioactive material had occurred came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden, where on 28 April workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (approximately 1100 km from the Chernobyl site) were found to have radioactive particles on their clothing. It was Sweden's search for the source of radioactivity (after they had determined there was no leak at the Swedish plant) that led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the Western Soviet Union. Contamination from the Chernobyl disaster was not evenly spread across the surrounding countryside but scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions. Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. A large area in Russia south of Bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine. 203 people were hospitalized immediately, of whom 31 died (28 of them died from acute radiation exposure). Most of these were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the disaster under control, who were not fully aware of how dangerous the radiation exposure (from the smoke) was (for a discussion of the more important isotopes in fallout see fission products). 135,000 people were evacuated from the area, including 50,000 from the nearby town of Pripyat, Ukraine. Health officials have predicted that over the next 70 years there will be a 28% increase in cancer rates in much of the population which was exposed to the 5‚Äì12 EBq (depending on source) of radioactive contamination released from the reactor. Soviet scientists reported that the Chernobyl Unit 4 reactor contained about 180‚Äì190 metric tons of uranium dioxide fuel and fission products. Estimates of the amount of this material that escaped range from 5 to 30%. Because of the intense heat of the fire, and with no containment building to stop it, part of the ejected fuel was vaporized or particularized and lofted high into the atmosphere, where it spread. Workers and \\"liquidators\\" Soviet medal awarded to 600,000+ liquidators. The workers involved in the recovery and clean up after the disaster, called \\"liquidators\\", received high doses of radiation. In most cases, these workers were not equipped with individual dosimeters to measure the amount of radiation received, so experts could only estimate their doses. Even where dosimeters were used, dosimetric procedures varied - some workers are thought to have been given more accurate estimated doses than others. According to Soviet estimates, between 300,000 and 600,000 people were involved in the cleanup of the 30 km evacuation zone around the reactor, but many of them entered the zone two years after the disaster.Chapter IV: Dose estimates, Nuclear Energy Agency, 2002 Estimates of the number of \\"liquidators\\" vary; the World Health Organization, for example, puts the figure at about 600,000; Russia lists as liquidators some people who did not work in contaminated areas. In the first year after the disaster, the number of cleanup workers in the zone was estimated to be 2,000. These workers received an estimated average dose of 165 millisieverts (16.5 REM). A sevenfold increase in DNA mutations has been identified in children of liquidators conceived after the accident, when compared to their siblings that were conceived before. However, this effect has diminished sharply over time. Evacuation Map showing caesium-137 contamination in the Chernobyl area in 1996 Soviet Military authorities started evacuating people from the area around Chernobyl only on the second day after the disaster (after about 36 hours). By May 1986, about a month later, all those living within a radius of the plant (about 116,000 people) had been relocated. This area is often referred to as the zone of alienation. However, significant radiation affected the environment over a much wider scale than this 30 km radius encloses. According to reports from Soviet scientists, 28,000 square kilometers (km2, or 10,800 square miles, mi2) were contaminated by caesium-137 to levels greater than 185 kBq per square meter. Roughly 830,000 people lived in this area. About 10,500 km 2 (4,000 mi2) were contaminated by caesium-137 to levels greater than 555 kBq/m2. Of this total, roughly 7,000 km2 (2,700 mi2) lie in Belarus, 2,000 km2 (800 mi2) in the Russian Federation and 1,500 km2 (580 mi2) in Ukraine. About 250,000 people lived in this area. These reported data were corroborated by the International Chernobyl Project.International Chernobyl Project. Ns.iaea.org. Retrieved 26 April 2012. Civilians Some children in the contaminated areas were exposed to high thyroid doses of up to 50 gray (Gy), mostly due to an intake of radioactive iodine-131 (a relatively short- lived isotope with a half-life of 8 days) from contaminated milk produced locally. Several studies have found that the incidence of thyroid cancer among children in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia has risen sharply since the Chernobyl disaster. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) notes \\"1800 documented cases of thyroid cancer in children who were between 0 and 14 years of age when the disaster occurred, which is far higher than normal\\",Frequently Asked Chernobyl Questions . Iaea.org. Retrieved 26 April 2012. although this source fails to note the expected rate. The childhood thyroid cancers that have appeared are of a large and aggressive type but, if detected early, can be treated. Treatment entails surgery followed by iodine-131 therapy for any metastases. To date, such treatment appears to have been successful in the vast majority of cases. Late in 1995, the World Health Organization (WHO) linked nearly 700 cases of thyroid cancer among children and adolescents to the Chernobyl disaster, and among these, some 10 deaths are attributed to radiation. However, the rapid increase in thyroid cancers detected suggests some of this increase may be an artifact of the screening process. Typical latency time of radiation-induced thyroid cancer is about 10 years, but the increase in childhood thyroid cancers in some regions was observed as early as 1987.

A large swath of pine forest killed by acute radiation was named the Red Forest. The dead pines were bulldozed and buried. Livestock were removed during the human evacuations. Elsewhere in Europe, levels of radioactivity were examined in various natural foodstocks. In both Sweden and Finland, fish in deep freshwater lakes were banned for resale and landowners were advised not to consume certain types. Information regarding physical deformities in the plant and animal populations in the areas affected by radioactive fallout require sampling and capture, along with DNA testing, of individuals to determine if abnormalities are the result of natural mutation, radiation poisoning, or exposure to other contaminants in the environment (i.e. pesticides, industrial waste, or agricultural run-off). Animals living in contaminated areas in and around Chernobyl have suffered from a variety of side effects caused by radiation. Oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants have had severe consequences on the development of the nervous system, including reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities. It has been found that birds living in areas with high levels of radiation have statistically significantly smaller brains, which has shown to be a deficit to viability in the wild. Barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) that live in or around Chernobyl have displayed an increased rate of physical abnormalities compared to swallows from uncontaminated areas. Abnormalities included partially albinistic plumage, deformed toes, tumors, deformed tail feathers, deformed beaks, and deformed air sacks. Birds with these abnormalities have a reduced viability in the wild and a decrease in fitness. Moeller et al. claimed in 2007 that these effects were likely due to radiation exposure and elevated teratogenic effects of radioactive isotopes in the environment although these conclusions have been challenged. Various birds in the area appear to have adapted to lower levels of radiation by producing more antioxidants, such as glutathione, to help mitigate the oxidative stress. Invertebrate populations (including bumblebees, butterflies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and spiders) significantly decreased. As of 2009, most radioactivity around Chernobyl was located in the top layer of soil, where many invertebrates live or lay their eggs. The reduced abundance of invertebrates could have negative implications for the entire ecosystem surrounding Chernobyl. Radionuclides migrate through either soil diffusion or transportation within the soil solution. The effects of ionizing radiation on plants and trees in particular depends on numerous factors, including climatic conditions, the mechanism of radiation deposition, and the soil type. In turn, radiated vegetation affects organisms further up the food chain. In general, the upper-level trophic organisms received less contamination, due to their ability to be more mobile and feed from multiple areas. The amount of radioactive nuclides found to have been deposited into surrounding lakes has increased the normal baseline radioactive amounts by 100 percent. Most of the radionuclides in surrounding water areas were found in the sediments at the bottom of the lakes. There has been a high incidence of chromosomal changes in plant and animal aquatic organisms, and this generally has correlated with the contamination and resulting genetic instability. Most of the lakes and rivers surrounding the Chernobyl exclusion zone are still highly contaminated with radionuclides (and will be for many years to come) as the natural decontamination processes of nuclides with longer half-lives can take many years. One of the main mechanisms by which radionuclides were passed to humans was through the ingestion of milk from contaminated cows. Most of the rough grazing that the cows took part in contained plant species such as coarse grasses, sedges, rushes, and plants such as heather (also known as calluna vulgaris). These plant species grow in soils that are high in organic matter, low in pH, and are often very well hydrated, thus making the storage and intake of these radionuclides much more feasible and efficient. In the early stages following the Chernobyl accident, high levels of radionuclides were found in the milk and were a direct result of contaminated feeding. Within two months of banning most of the milk that was being produced in the affected areas, officials had phased out the majority of the contaminated feed that was available to the cows and much of the contamination was isolated. In humans, ingestion of milk containing abnormally high levels of iodine radionuclides was the precursor for thyroid disease, especially in children and in the immunocompromised. Some plants and animals were able to adapt to the increased radiation levels present in and around Chernobyl. Arabidopsis, a plant native to Chernobyl, was able to resist high concentrations of ionizing radiation and resist forming mutations. This species of plant has been able to develop mechanisms to tolerate chronic radiation that would otherwise be harmful or lethal to other species. Studies suggest the 30 km (19-mile) \\"exclusion zone\\" surrounding the Chernobyl disaster has become a wildlife sanctuary. Animals have reclaimed the land including species such as the Przewalski‚Äôs horse, Eurasian lynx, wild boar, grey wolf, elk, red deer, moose, brown bear, turtle, voles, mice, shrews, European badger, Eurasian beaver, raccoon dog, red fox, roe deer, European bison, black stork, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle and eagle owl whose populations are all thriving. When the disaster first occurred, the health and reproductive ability of many animals and plants were negatively affected for the first six months. However, 30 years later, animals and plants have reclaimed the abandoned zone to make it their habitat. Even the site of the explosion was flourishing with wildlife in 2012 as birds nested in the wrecked nuclear plant, and plants and mushrooms lived in and on the site. A 2015 study found similar numbers of mammals in the zone compared to nearby similar nature reserves and the wildlife population was probably higher than it had been before the accident. Due to the bioaccumulation of caesium-137, some mushrooms as well as wild animals which eat them, e.g. wild boars hunted in Germany and deer in Austria, may have levels which are not considered safe for human consumption. Mandatory radioactivity testing of sheep in parts of the UK that graze on lands with contaminated peat was lifted in 2012. In 2016, 187 local Ukrainians had returned and were living permanently in the zone. Human pregnancy Despite spurious studies from Germany and Turkey, the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident was the increase in elective abortions, these \\"indirect effects\\", in Greece, Denmark, Italy etc., have been attributed to \\"anxieties created\\" by the media. Researchers at the time knew that very high doses of radiation increase the rate of physiological pregnancy and fetal abnormalities, but select researchers who were familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing knew that, unlike the dominant linear no-threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases, the \\"Malformation of organs appears to be a deterministic effect (an effect not caused by chance) with a threshold dose\\" below which no rate increase is observed.Teratogen Update: Radiation and Chernobyl, Frank P. Castronovo Jr.TERATOLOGY 60:100‚Äì106 (1999) Frank Castronovo of the Harvard Medical School discussed this teratology (birth defects) issue in 1999, publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the Chernobyl accident, which included data from Kiev's two largest obstetrics hospitals. Castronovo concludes that \\"the lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects\\" and dubious studies that flawed by \\"selection bias\\", are the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that Chernobyl increased the background rate of birth defects. However, the vast amount of pregnancy data simply does not support this perception because, since no pregnant individuals took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations, no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose. Despite Mr. Castronovo's statements Karl Sperling, Heidemarie Neitzel and Hagen Scherb reported that the prevalence of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) in West Berlin, Germany, peaked 9 months following the main fallout.[ 11, 12] From 1980 to 1986 the birth prevalence of Down syndrome was quite stable (i.e., 1.35‚Äì1.59 per 1,000 live births [27‚Äì31 cases]). In 1987, 46 cases were diagnosed (prevalence = 2.11 per 1,000 live births) and most of the increase resulted from a cluster of 12 children born in January 1987. The prevalence of Down Syndrome in 1988 was 1.77, and in 1989, it reached pre-Chernobyl values. The authors noted that the cluster of children would have been conceived when radioactive clouds containing radionucleotides with short half-lives, like iodine, would have been covering the region and also that the isolated geographical position of West Berlin prior to reunification, the free genetic counseling, and complete coverage of the population through one central cytogenetic laboratory supported completeness of case ascertainment; in addition, constant culture preparation and analysis protocols ensure a high quality of data. Long-term health effects= Science and politics: the problem of epidemiological studies  Pripyat, close to Chernobyl. The issue of long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster on civilians is very controversial. The number of people whose lives were affected by the disaster is sizable. Over 300,000 people were resettled because of the disaster; millions lived and continue to live in the contaminated area. On the other hand, most of those affected received relatively low doses of radiation; there is little evidence of increased mortality, cancers or birth defects among them; and when such evidence is present, existence of a causal link to radioactive contamination is uncertain. An increased incidence of thyroid cancer among children in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia affected by the Chernobyl disaster has been firmly established as a result of screening programs and, in the case of Belarus, an established cancer registry. The findings of most epidemiological studies must be considered interim, say experts, as analysis of the health effects of the disaster is an ongoing process. Multilevel modelling indicates that long-term psychological distress among Belarusians affected by the Chernobyl disaster is better predicted by stress-moderating psychosocial factors present in one's daily life than by level of residential radiation contamination. Epidemiological studies have been hampered in Ukraine, Russian Federation and Belarus by a lack of funds, an infrastructure with little or no experience in chronic disease epidemiology, poor communication facilities and an immediate public health problem with many dimensions. Emphasis has been placed on screening rather than on well-designed epidemiological studies. International efforts to organize epidemiological studies have been slowed by some of the same factors, especially the lack of a suitable scientific infrastructure. Furthermore, the political nature of nuclear energy may have affected scientific studies. In Belarus, Yury Bandazhevsky, a scientist who questioned the official estimates of Chernobyl's consequences and the relevancy of the official maximum limit of 1,000 Bq/kg, was imprisoned from 2001 to 2005. Bandazhevsky and some human rights groups allege his imprisonment was a reprisal for his publication of reports critical of the official research being conducted into the Chernobyl incident. The activities undertaken by Belarus and Ukraine in response to the disaster ‚Äî remediation of the environment, evacuation and resettlement, development of uncontaminated food sources and food distribution channels, and public health measures ‚Äî have overburdened the governments of those countries. International agencies and foreign governments have provided extensive logistic and humanitarian assistance. In addition, the work of the European Commission and World Health Organization in strengthening the epidemiological research infrastructure in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus is laying the basis for major advances in these countries' ability to carry out epidemiological studies of all kinds.  Caesium radioisotopes  Immediately after the disaster, the main health concern involved radioactive iodine, with a half- life of eight days. Today, there is concern about contamination of the soil with strontium-90 and caesium-137, which have half-lives of about 30 years. The highest levels of caesium-137 are found in the surface layers of the soil where they are absorbed by plants, insects and mushrooms, entering the local food supply. Some scientists fear that radioactivity will affect the local population for the next several generations. Note that caesium is not mobile in most soils because it binds to the clay minerals.Microsoft Word - !!MASTERDOC cesium dr3 mar2 ac.doc. (PDF) . Retrieved 26 April 2012.Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI. Osti.gov. Retrieved 26 April 2012. Tests (c. 1997) showed that caesium-137 levels in trees of the area were continuing to rise. It is unknown if this is still the case. There is some evidence that contamination is migrating into underground aquifers and closed bodies of water such as lakes and ponds (2001, Germenchuk). The main source of elimination is predicted to be natural decay of caesium-137 to stable barium-137, since runoff by rain and groundwater has been demonstrated to be negligible.  Thyroid cancer  An increased incidence of thyroid cancer was observed for about 4 years after the accident and slowed in 2005.Grimm, E., & University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, degree granting institution. (2015). Thyroid nodules as related to absorbed dose from iodine-131 in a Ukrainian cohort following the Chernobyl accident. The large increase in incidence of thyroid cancer happened amongst individuals who were adolescents and young children living during the time of the accident, and residing in the most contaminated areas of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. High levels of radioactive iodine were released in the environment from the Chernobyl reactor after the accident, and accumulated in pastures which were eaten by cows. The milk was later consumed by children who already had an iodine deficient diet, therefore causing more of the radioactive iodine to be accumulated. Radioactive iodine has a short half-life, 8.02 days, if the contaminated milk would have been avoided or stopped, it is likely that most of the rise in radiation-induced thyroid cancer wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Within the highly contaminated areas ‚Äì Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, there were around 5000 cases of thyroid cancer that have been diagnosed since the accident. These cases were found in individuals who were aged 18 and younger during the time of the accident. Supported by the Russian Federation and Ukraine, The European Commission, the National Cancer Institute of the US, and the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation, The Chernobyl Tissue Bank (CTB) was created in 1998, 6 years after published research showed a rise in childhood thyroid cancer. The project is the first international co-operation that collects biological samples from patients exposed to radioiodine during childhood. It started collecting a variety of biological samples from patients on 1 October 1998 and since July 2001 has been a source for ethically available tissue samples - specifically extracted nucleic acids and tissue sections - for 21 research projects in Japan, Europe and the USA. The CTB serves as a model for tissue banking for cancer research in the molecular age.  34 years after the incident  Twenty-five years after the incident, restriction orders had remained in place in the production, transportation and consumption of food contaminated by Chernobyl fallout. In the UK, only in 2012 the mandatory radioactivity testing of sheep in contaminated parts of the UK that graze on lands was lifted. They covered 369 farms on 750 km2 and 200,000 sheep. In parts of Sweden and Finland, restrictions are in place on stock animals, including reindeer, in natural and near-natural environments. \\"In certain regions of Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and Poland, wild game (including boar and deer), wild mushrooms, berries and carnivorous fish from lakes reach levels of several thousand Bq per kg of caesium-137\\", while \\"in Germany, caesium-137 levels in wild boar muscle reached 40,000 Bq/kg. The average level is 6,800 Bq/kg, more than ten times the EU limit of 600 Bq/kg\\", according to the TORCH 2006 report. The European Commission has stated that \\"The restrictions on certain foodstuffs from certain Member States must therefore continue to be maintained for many years to come\\". As of 2009, sheep farmed in some areas of the UK are still subject to inspection which may lead to them being prohibited from entering the human food chain because of contamination arising from the accident: > Some of this radioactivity, predominantly radiocaesium-137, was deposited on > certain upland areas of the UK, where sheep-farming is the primary land-use. > Due to the particular chemical and physical properties of the peaty soil > types present in these upland areas, the radiocaesium is still able to pass > easily from soil to grass and hence accumulate in sheep.

Restrictions were finally lifted in 2012. In Norway, the Sami people were affected by contaminated food (the reindeer had been contaminated by eating lichen, which accumulates some types of radioactivity emitters). Data from a long-term monitoring program from 1998 to 2015 (The Korma Report II) shows a significant decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of small villages in Belarus 80 km north of Gomel. Resettlement may even be possible in parts of the prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules. Effect on the natural world Earth Observing-1 image of the reactor and surrounding area in April 2009. According to reports from Soviet scientists at the First International Conference on the Biological and Radiological Aspects of the Chernobyl Accident (September 1990), fallout levels in the 10 km zone around the plant were as high as 4.81 GBq/m2. The so- called \\"Red Forest\\" (or \\"Rusted Forest\\") is the swath of pine trees,Energy Citations Database (ECD) - - Document #5012309. Osti.gov. Retrieved 26 April 2012. located immediately behind the reactor complex within the 10 km zone, which were killed off by heavy radioactive fallout. The forest is so named because in the days following the disaster the trees appeared to have a deep red hue as they died because of extremely heavy radioactive fallout. In the post-disaster cleanup operations, a majority of the 10 km2 forest was bulldozed and buried. The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world. In recent years there have been many reports suggesting the zone may be a fertile habitat for wildlife. For example, in the 1996 BBC Horizon documentary 'Inside Chernobyl's Sarcophagus', birds are seen flying in and out of large holes in the structure itself. Other casual observations suggest biodiversity around the massive radioactivity release has increased due to the removal of human influence (see the first hand account of the wildlife preserve). Storks, wolves, beavers, and eagles have been reported in the area. Barn swallows sampled between 1991 and 2006 both in the Chernobyl exclusion zone had more physical abnormalities than control sparrows sampled elsewhere in Europe. Abnormal barn swallows mated with lower frequency, causing the percentage of abnormal swallows to decrease over time. This demonstrated the selective pressure against the abnormalities was faster than the effects of radiation that created the abnormalities.\\"Elevated frequency of abnormalities in barn swallows from Chernobyl\\", in Biology Letters, Volume 3, Number 4 / 22 August 2007 \\"This was a big surprise to us,\\" Dr. Mousseau said. \\"We had no idea of the impact.\\"\\"Did Chernobyl Leave an Eden for Wildlife?\\", by Henry Fountain, The New York Times, 28 August 2007 It is unknown whether fallout contamination will have any long-term adverse effect on the flora and fauna of the region, as plants and animals have significantly different and varying radiologic tolerance compared with humans. Some birds are reported with stunted tail feathers (which interferes with breeding). There are reports of mutations in plants in the area. The Chernobyl area has not received very much biological study, although studies that have been done suggest that apparently healthy populations may be sink instead of source populations; in other words, that the apparently healthy populations are not contributing to the survival of species. Using robots, researchers have retrieved samples of highly melanized black fungus from the walls of the reactor core itself. It has been shown that certain species of fungus, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Cladosporium, can actually thrive in a radioactive environment, growing better than non-melanized variants, implying that they use melanin to harness the energy of ionizing radiation from the reactor. Studies on wildlife in the Exclusion Zone The Exclusion Zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power station is reportedly a haven for wildlife.BBC, 20 April 2006, Wildlife defies Chernobyl radiation As humans were evacuated from the area in 1986, existing animal populations multiplied and rare species not seen for centuries have returned or have been reintroduced, for example Eurasian lynx, wild boar, Eurasian wolf, Eurasian brown bear, European bison, Przewalski's horse, and Eurasian eagle owls. Birds even nest inside the cracked concrete sarcophagus shielding the shattered remains of Reactor 4. In 2007 the Ukrainian government designated the Exclusion Zone as a wildlife sanctuary,Mother Nature Network, 7 May 2009, Scientists disagree over radiation effects and at 488.7 km2 it is one of the largest wildlife sanctuaries in Europe. According to a 2005 U.N. report, wildlife has returned despite radiation levels that are presently 10 to 100 times higher than normal background radiation. Although radiation levels were significantly higher soon after the accident, they have fallen because of radioactive decay.The Washington Post, 7 June 2007, Chernobyl Area Becomes Wildlife Haven M√∏ller and Tim Mousseau have published the results of the largest census of animal life in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. It said, contrary to the Chernobyl Forum's 2005 report, that the biodiversity of insects, birds and mammals is declining. M√∏ller and Mousseau have been criticized strongly by Sergey Gaschak, a Ukrainian biologist who did field work for the pair beginning in 2003. He regards their conclusions to be the result of a biased and unscientific anti-nuclear political agenda, unsupported by the data he collected for them. \\"I know Chernobyl Zone,\\" he says. \\"I worked here many years. I can‚Äôt believe their results.\\" Some researchers have said that by halting the destruction of habitat, the Chernobyl disaster helped wildlife flourish. Biologist Robert J. Baker of Texas Tech University was one of the first to report that Chernobyl had become a wildlife haven and that many rodents he has studied at Chernobyl since the early 1990s have shown remarkable tolerance for elevated radiation levels. M√∏ller et al. (2005) suggested that the reproductive success and annual survival rates of barn swallows are much lower in the Exclusion Zone; 28% of barn swallows inhabiting Chernobyl return each year, while at a control area at Kanev, 250 km to the southeast, the return rate is around 40%. A later study by M√∏ller et al. (2007) furthermore claimed an elevated frequency of eleven categories of subtle physical abnormalities in barn swallows, such as bent tail feathers, deformed air sacs, deformed beaks, and isolated albinistic feathers. Smith et al. (2007) have disputed M√∏ller's findings and instead proposed that a lack of human influence in the Exclusion Zone locally reduced the swallows' insect prey and that radiation levels across the vast majority of the exclusion zone are now too low to have an observable negative effect. But the criticisms raised were responded to in M√∏ller et al. (2008). It is possible that barn swallows are particularly vulnerable to elevated levels of ionizing radiation because they are migratory; they arrive in the exclusion area exhausted and with depleted reserves of radio-protective antioxidants after their journey. Several research groups have suggested that plants in the area have adapted to cope with the high radiation levels, for example by increasing the activity of DNA cellular repair machinery and by hypermethylation. Given the uncertainties, further research is needed to assess the long-term health effects of elevated ionizing radiation from Chernobyl on flora and fauna. In 2015, long-term empirical data showed no evidence of a negative influence of radiation on mammal abundance.  Chernobyl Forum report and criticisms  In September 2005, a comprehensive report was published by the Chernobyl Forum, comprising a number of agencies including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations bodies and the Governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This report titled: \\"Chernobyl's legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio- Economic Impacts\\", authored by about 100 recognized experts from many countries, put the total predicted number of deaths due to the disaster around 4,000 (of which 2,200 deaths are expected to be in the ranks of 200,000 liquidators). This predicted death toll includes the 47 workers who died of acute radiation syndrome as a direct result of radiation from the disaster, nine children who died from thyroid cancer and an estimated 4000 people who could die from cancer as a result of exposure to radiation. This number was subsequently updated to 9000 excess cancer deaths.World Health Organisation \\"World Health Organization report explains the health impacts of the world's worst-ever civil nuclear accident\\", WHO, 26 April 2006. Retrieved 4 April 2011. An IAEA press officer admitted that the 4000 figure was given prominence in the report \\"...to counter the much higher estimates which had previously been seen. ... \\"It was a bold action to put out a new figure that was much less than conventional wisdom.\\"\\"BBC News \\"'Too little known on Chernobyl'\\", BBC News, 19 April 2006. Retrieved 4 April 2011. The report also stated that, apart from a 30 kilometre area around the site and a few restricted lakes and forests, radiation levels had returned to acceptable levels. For full coverage see the IAEA Focus Page.and joint IAEA/WHO/UNDP press release Chernobyl: The True Scale of the Accident , IAEA/WHO/UNDP, 5 September 2005 (pdf file) The methodology of the Chernobyl Forum report, supported by Elisabeth Cardis of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, has been disputed by some advocacy organizations opposed to nuclear energy, such as Greenpeace and the International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear Warfare (IPPNW), as well as some individuals such as Dr. Michel Fernex, retired medical doctor from the WHO and campaigner Dr. Christopher Busby (Green Audit, LLRC). The main criticism has been with regard to the restriction of the Forum's study to Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Furthermore, it only studied the case of 200,000 people involved in the cleanup, and the 400,000 most directly affected by the released radioactivity. German Green Party Member of the European Parliament Rebecca Harms, commissioned a report on Chernobyl in 2006 (TORCH, The Other Report on Chernobyl). The 2006 TORCH report claimed that: > In terms of their surface areas, Belarus (22% of its land area) and Austria > (13%) were most affected by higher levels of contamination. Other countries > were seriously affected; for example, more than 5% of Ukraine, Finland and > Sweden were contaminated to high levels (> 40,000 Bq/m2 caesium-137). More > than 80% of Moldova, the European part of Turkey, Slovenia, Switzerland, > Austria and the Slovak Republic were contaminated to lower levels (> 4,000 > Bq/m2 caesium-137). And 44% of Germany and 34% of the UK were similarly > affected. (See map of radioactive distribution of caesium-137 in Europe) While the IAEA/WHO and UNSCEAR considered areas with exposure greater than 40,000 Bq/m2, the TORCH report also included areas contaminated with more than 4,000 Bq/m2 of Cs-137. The TORCH 2006 report \\"estimated that more than half the iodine-131 from Chernobyl [which increases the risk of thyroid cancer] was deposited outside the former Soviet Union. Possible increases in thyroid cancer have been reported in the Czech Republic and the UK, but more research is needed to evaluate thyroid cancer incidences in Western Europe\\". It predicted about 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths, 7 to 15 Times greater than the figure of 4,000 in the IAEA press release; warned that predictions of excess cancer deaths strongly depend on the risk factor used; and predicted excess cases of thyroid cancer range between 18,000 and 66,000 in Belarus alone depending on the risk projection model.TORCH report executive summary, op.cit., p.4 However, elevated incidence thyroid cancer is still seen among Ukrainians who were exposed to radioactivity due to Chernobyl accident during their childhood, but who were diagnosed the malignancy as adults. Another study claims possible heightened mortality in Sweden.Chernobyl 'caused Sweden cancers', BBC News, 20 November 2004 Greenpeace quoted a 1998 WHO study, which counted 212 dead from only 72,000 liquidators. The environmental NGO estimated a total death toll of 93,000 but cite in their report that \\"The most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine alone the disaster could have resulted in an estimated 200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004.\\" In its report, Greenpeace suggested there will be 270,000 cases of cancer alone attributable to Chernobyl fallout, and that 93,000 of these will probably be fatal compare with the IAEA 2005 report which claimed that \\"99% of thyroid cancers wouldn't be lethal\\". According to the Union Chernobyl, the main organization of liquidators, 10% of the 600,000 liquidators are now dead, and 165,000 disabled. and see also According to an April 2006 report by the International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear Warfare (IPPNW), entitled \\"Health Effects of Chernobyl - 20 years after the reactor catastrophe\\",http://www.ippnw-students.org/chernobyl/IPPNWStudy.pdf more than 10,000 people are today affected by thyroid cancer and 50,000 cases are expected. In Europe, the IPPNW claims that 10,000 deformities have been observed in newborns because of Chernobyl's radioactive discharge, with 5,000 deaths among newborn children. They also state that several hundreds of thousands of the people who worked on the site after the disaster are now sick because of radiation, and tens of thousands are dead. Revisiting the issue for the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, the Union of Concerned Scientists described the Forum's estimate of four thousand as pertaining only to \\"a much smaller subgroup of people who experienced the greatest exposure to released radiation\\". Their estimates for the broader population are 50,000 excess cancer cases resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths.Chernobyl Cancer Death Toll Estimate More Than Six Times Higher Than the 4,000 Frequently Cited, According to a New UCS Analysis. Ucsusa.org. Retrieved 26 April 2012.  Human health effects Studies  The majority of premature deaths caused by Chernobyl are expected to be the result of cancers and other diseases induced by radiation in the decades after the event. This will be the result of a large population (some studies have considered the entire population of Europe) exposed to relatively low doses of radiation increasing the risk of cancer across that population. Interpretations of the current health state of exposed populations vary. Therefore, estimates of the ultimate human impact of the disaster have relied on numerical models of the effects of radiation on health. Furthermore, the effects of low-level radiation on human health are not well understood, and so the models used, notably the linear no threshold model, are open to question. Given these factors, studies of Chernobyl's health effects have come up with different conclusions and are sometimes the subject of scientific and political controversy. The following section presents some of the major studies on this topic.  Official studies  Chernobyl Forum report = In September 2005, a draft summary report by the Chernobyl Forum, comprising a number of UN agencies including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), other UN bodies and the Governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, set the number of deaths due to the accident at about 50 (47 workers who died of acute radiation syndrome and 9 children who died from thyroid cancer), and added that a \\"total of up to 4000 people could eventually die of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident\\" (excess cancer deaths which might eventually happen among the 600,000 with the highest levels of exposure.For full coverage see the IAEA Focus Page (op.cit.) and joint IAEA/WHO/UNDP 5 September 2005 press release Chernobyl: The True Scale of the Accident ). The full version of the WHO health effects report adopted by the UN, published in April 2006, included an added 5000 eventually possible fatalities from significantly contaminated areas in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine and predicted that, in total, an upper limit of 9000 might eventually die from cancer among the 6.9 million most-exposed Soviet citizens. Some newspapers and antinuclear organizations claimed the paper was minimizing the consequences of the accident. = 2008 UNSCEAR report = The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) produced a detailed report on the effects of Chernobyl for the General Assembly of the UN in 2011. This report concluded that 134 staff and emergency workers suffered acute radiation syndrome and of those 28 died of radiation exposure within three months. Many of the survivors suffered skin conditions and radiation induced cataracts, and 19 had since died, but from conditions not necessarily associated with radiation exposure. Of the several hundred thousand liquidators, apart from some emerging indications of increased leukaemia, there was no other evidence of health effects. In the general public in the affected areas, the only effect with 'persuasive evidence' was a substantial fraction of the 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer in adolescents of whom by 2005 15 cases had proved fatal. There was no evidence of increased rates of solid cancers or leukaemia among the general population. However, there was a widespread psychological worry about the effects of radiation. The total deaths reliably attributable by UNSCEAR to the radiation produced by the accident therefore was 62. The report concluded that 'the vast majority of the population need not live in fear of serious health consequences from the Chernobyl accident'.  Unofficial studies  TORCH report = In 2006 German Green Party Member of the European Parliament Rebecca Harms commissioned two UK scientists for an alternate report (TORCH, The Other Report on CHernobyl) in response to the UN report. The report included areas not covered by the Chernobyl forum report, and also lower radiation doses. It predicted about 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths and warned that predictions of excess cancer deaths strongly depend on the risk factor used, and urged more research stating that large uncertainties made it difficult to properly assess the full scale of the disaster. = Greenpeace = WHO in Geneva Greenpeace claimed contradictions in the Chernobyl Forum reports, quoting a 1998 WHO study referenced in the 2005 report, which projected 212 dead from 72,000 liquidators. In its report, Greenpeace suggested there will be 270,000 cases of cancer attributable to Chernobyl fallout, and that 93,000 of these will probably be fatal, but state in their report that \\"The most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine alone the accident could have resulted in an estimated 200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004.\\" Blake Lee-Harwood, campaigns director at Greenpeace, believes that cancer was likely to be the cause of less than half of the final fatalities and that \\"intestinal problems, heart and circulation problems, respiratory problems, endocrine problems, and particularly effects on the immune system,\\" will also cause fatalities. However, concern has been expressed about the methods used in compiling the Greenpeace report. It is not peer reviewed nor does it rely on peer review science as the Chernobyl Forum report did. = April 2006 IPPNW report = According to an April 2006 report by the German affiliate of the International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear Warfare (IPPNW), entitled \\"Health Effects of Chernobyl\\", more than 10,000 people are today affected by thyroid cancer and 50,000 cases are expected. The report projected tens of thousands dead among the liquidators. In Europe, it alleges that 10,000 deformities have been observed in newborns because of Chernobyl's radioactive discharge, with 5000 deaths among newborn children. They also claimed that several hundreds of thousands of the people who worked on the site after the accident are now sick because of radiation, and tens of thousands are dead. =Yablokov/Nesterenko publication= Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment is an English translation of the 2007 Russian publication Chernobyl by Alexey Yablokov, Vassily Nesterenko and Alexey Nesterenko. It was published online in 2009 by the New York Academy of Sciences in their Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. The New York Academy of Sciences included a disclaimer to inform readers it did not commission, endorse or peer review the work. \\"In no sense did Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences or the New York Academy of Sciences commission this work; nor by its publication does the Academy validate the claims made in the original Slavic language publications cited in the translated papers. Importantly, the translated volume has not been formally peer‚Äêreviewed by the New York Academy of Sciences or by anyone else.\\"New York Academy of Sciences. The report presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between 1986, the year of the accident, and 2004 reflect 985,000 deaths as a result of the radioactivity released. The authors suggest that most of the deaths were in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, but others were spread through the many other countries the radiation from Chernobyl struck. The literature analysis draws on over 1,000 published titles and over 5,000 internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading Eastern European authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the IAEA and UNSCEAR. Author Alexy V. Yablokov was also one of the general editors on the Greenpeace commissioned report also criticizing the Chernobyl Forum findings published one year prior to the Russian-language version of this report. A critical review by Dr. Monty Charles in the journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry states that Consequences is a direct extension of the 2005 Greenpeace report, updated with data of unknown quality. \\"During the production of the reports from the Chernobyl Forum and Greenpeace, a vast body of previously unknown data began to emerge in the form of publications, reports, theses, etc. from Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, much of it in Slavic languages. Little of these data appears to have been incorporated into the international literature. The quality of these publications and whether they would sustain critical peer-review in the western scientific literature is unknown. The book by Yablokov et al. is part of an attempt to summarise these new findings and include them to extend the findings of the Greenpeace report.\\" The New York Academy of Sciences also published a severely critical review by M. I. Balonov from the Institute of Radiation Hygiene (St. Petersburg, Russia) which stated that \\"The value of [Consequences] is not zero, but negative, as its bias is obvious only to specialists, while inexperienced readers may well be put into deep error.\\" Several other critical responses have also been published. =Higher than statistically normal appearances of defects= The American Academy of Pediatrics published a study state that the overall rate of neural tube defects in the Rivne region of the Ukraine is one of the highest in Europe (22 per 10,000 live births). The rate in Polissia (Ukraine) is 27.0 per 10,000.

The claim appears to have been invented by her through a very creative interpretation of a webpage of the Kyiv Regional Administration. Psychological after-effects, as the 2006 UN report pointed out, have also had adverse effects on internally displaced persons. *In a recently published study scientists from Forschungszentrum J√ºlich, Germany, published the \\"Korma- Report\\" with data of radiological long-term measurements that were performed between 1998 and 2007 in a region in Belarus that was affected by the Chernobyl accident. The internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants in a village in Korma County/Belarus caused by the existing radioactive contamination has experienced a significant decrease from a very high level. The external exposure, however, reveals a different picture. Although an overall decrease was observed, the organic constituents of the soil show an increase in contamination. This increase was not observed in soils from cultivated land or gardens. According to the Korma Report the internal dose will decrease to less than 0.2 mSv/a in 2011 and to below 0.1 mSv/a in 2020. Despite this, the cumulative dose will remain significantly higher than \\"normal\\" values due to external exposure. Resettlement may even be possible in former prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules.Dederichs, H.; Pillath, J.; Heuel-Fabianek, B.; Hill, P.; Lennartz, R.

Indeed, results of analyses of time trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Europe do not, at present, indicate any increase in cancer rates ‚Äì other than of thyroid cancer in the most contaminated regions ‚Äì that can be clearly attributed to radiation from the Chernobyl accident.\\"IARC Press release on the report 'Estimates of the cancer burden in Europe from radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident' They estimate, based on the linear no threshold model of cancer effects, that 16,000 excess cancer deaths could be expected from the effects of the Chernobyl accident up to 2065. Their estimates have very wide 95% confidence intervals from 6,700 deaths to 38,000.Briefing document: Cancer burden in Europe following Chernobyl *The application of the linear no threshold model to predict deaths from low levels of exposure to radiation was disputed in a BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) Horizon documentary, broadcast on 13 July 2006. It offered statistical evidence to suggest that there is an exposure threshold of about 200 millisieverts, below which there is no increase in radiation-induced disease. Indeed, it went further, reporting research from Professor Ron Chesser of Texas Tech University, which suggests that low exposures to radiation can have a protective effect. The program interviewed scientists who believe that the increase in thyroid cancer in the immediate area of the explosion had been over-recorded, and predicted that the estimates for widespread deaths in the long term would be proved wrong. It noted the view of the World Health Organization scientist Dr Mike Rapacholi that, while most cancers can take decades to manifest, leukemia manifests within a decade or so: none of the previously expected peak of leukemia deaths has been found, and none is now expected. Identifying the need to balance the \\"fear response\\" in the public's reaction to radiation, the program quoted Dr Peter Boyle, director of the IARC: \\"Tobacco smoking will cause several thousand times more cancers in the [European] population.\\"\\"Inside Chernobyl's Sarcophagus\\" (13 July 1996), Horizon, BBC. * An article in Der Spiegel in April 2016 also cast doubt on the use of the linear no threshold model to predict cancer rates from Chernobyl. The article claimed that the threshold for radiation damage was over 100 millisieverts and reported initial results of large-scale trials in Germany by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research and three other German institutes in 2016 showing beneficial results of decreasing inflammation and strengthening bones from lower radiation doses. * Professor Wade Allison of Oxford University (a lecturer in medical physics and particle physics) gave a talk on ionising radiation 24 November 2006 in which he gave an approximate figure of 81 cancer deaths from Chernobyl (excluding 28 cases from acute radiation exposure and the thyroid cancer deaths which he regards as \\"avoidable\\"). In a closely reasoned argument using statistics from therapeutic radiation, exposure to elevated natural radiation (the presence of radon gas in homes) and the diseases of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors he demonstrated that the linear no-threshold model should not be applied to low-level exposure in humans, as it ignores the well-known natural repair mechanisms of the body. *A photographic essay by photojournalist Paul Fusco documents problems in the children in the Chernobyl region.

I, \\"Pathology of Incorporated Ionizing Radiation\\", Belarus Technical University, Minsk. 136 pp., 1999. = French legal action = Since March 2001, 400 lawsuits have been filed in France against \\"X\\" (the French equivalent of John Doe, an unknown person or company) by the French Association of Thyroid-affected People, including 200 in April 2006. These persons are affected by thyroid cancer or goitres, and have filed lawsuits alleging that the French government, at the time led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, had not adequately informed the population of the risks linked to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout. The complaint contrasts the health protection measures put in place in nearby countries (warning against consumption of green vegetables or milk by children and pregnant women) with the relatively high contamination suffered by the east of France and Corsica. Although the 2006 study by the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety said that no clear link could be found between Chernobyl and the increase of thyroid cancers in France, it also stated that papillary thyroid cancer had tripled in the following years. (includes Audio files, with an interview with Chantal Loire, president of the French Association of Thyroid- Affected People , as well as interviews with member of the CRIIRAD)  International response  After the Chernobyl Disaster, many countries were reluctant to expand their own nuclear programs. Some countries, such as Italy and Switzerland tried to ban nuclear power all together. Others, such as the Netherlands and Finland postponed the addition of nuclear power plants. The disaster reaffirmed policy made by Austria and Sweden to terminate use of all nuclear energy. Germany set up regulatory organizations and new policy including the Federal Ministry of Environment and Reactor Safety and a new act for precaution protection against nuclear radiation. Policy levers were not only implemented on a national level, but on an international level as well. In June 1986, the European Community implemented new standards for cesium. They attempted to do the same for iodine, but could not reach an agreement. Additionally several international programs were formed, including the World Association of Nuclear Operators. This association essentially linked 130 operators in 30 different countries. Nuclear engineers would visit nuclear plants worldwide to learn and work towards better safety precautions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), established in 1957, created the Nuclear Safety Assistance Coordination Centre, which serves as an example of the international, multilateral cooperation resulting from the disaster (World Nuclear, 2016). They created the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. Nations called for a more comprehensive set of obligatory regulations for nuclear power plants from safe management of installation to safe management of radioactive waste. They also created the Joint Convention of Safety of Spent Fuel Management in which obliged nations to create proper policy to control nuclear power plant management.Rautenbach, J., Tonhauser, W., Wetherall, A., Schwartz, J., Moser, B., Von Busekist, O., . . .

Fitch is attributed with much of the company's successful growth in its early years and a collection of now-defunct upscale apparel and fragrances were introduced in his name. Life and career Ezra Fitch in 1930 Ezra Fitch, portrait from passport application Ezra Hasbrouck Fitch was born September 27, 1865 in Coxsackie, Greene County, New York. He was the only child of Roswell Reed Fitch and Margaretta Wyanna Hasbrouck, both were Christians. Roswell Reed Fitch (1841-1888U.S. Federal Census) was the son of Ezra Fitch (1805-1870) and Margaret Reed. Margaretta Hasbrouck (1846-1865Church Record- Marbletown, NY Ref. Ch.) was the daughter of Benjamin L. Hasbrouck and Margaret Rim. Ezra‚Äôs mother died shortly after his birth. Ezra spent his early years growing up at the Roswell Reed estate on the banks of the Hudson in Coxsackie built by his grandfather around 1850. The estate included a large Gothic Revival mansion, numerous dependent structures and a dock on the river from which the family conducted a profitable freighting business. R. R. Fitch lived in Brooklyn for a time, working as an agent for an asphalt company. He married Sarah Huntington Sturges in Brooklyn in 1897.NY Health Dept. record She was the daughter of Stephen Buckingham Sturges (1827-1897), a banker, who was born in Mansfield, Ohio, and Sarah Minerva Cary (1833-) of Syracuse, New York. He was engaged as a real estate developer in Kingston, New York, trading as Jenkins & Fitch. The company built the Huntington apartment house there, among other projects.People's history of Kingston, Rondout and vicinity 1943 According to the A&F; company, Fitch was \\"restless and bored with his profession\\". He enjoyed the outdoors, and spent his leisure time yachting, climbing the Adirondacks and fishing in the streams of the Catskills. When David Abercrombie opened his excursions store Abercrombie Co. in 1892, Fitch became the store's \\"most devoted customer.\\" In 1900, Fitch bought a major share into the ever-successfully growing company and thus became partners with Abercrombie: supposedly he had to \\"[convince]\\" Abercrombie into it. By 1904, Fitch's surname was incorporated into the company's name as \\"Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\\" A&F; calls Fitch an innovator, and claims that \\"it can't be done\\" was not in his vocabulary.

Although both men shared financial success with the company, they became rather an annoyance to one another as is common in company partnerships. Fitch disputed with Abercrombie about who best to manage the company. Fitch wanted to expand the company to the general public, whereas Abercrombie, who was conservative, wanted the company to remain as a store for the elite.The History of Abercrombie and Fitch In the end, Abercrombie sold his share to Fitch in 1907. During the Fitch era of the Abercrombie & Fitch Co., the company experienced great success. Fitch expanded and managed the company to great levels of popularity. He created its first mail-order catalog, released in 1909. The historical introduction of Mahjong to the United States from China has been attributed to Fitch as merchandise in the Abercrombie & Fitch store in 1920. In 1928, Fitch retired from the company, leaving it under new management. He died on June 16, 1930 on his newly built 60-foot cruising yacht 'Content' at Santa Barbara, California, only a few days after moving on to the boat.

It focuses on spontaneous and long-lasting behavior change of an entire community. The goal of CLTS is to end open defecation. The term \\"triggering\\" is central to the CLTS process. It refers to ways of igniting community interest in ending open defecation, usually by building simple toilets, such as pit latrines. CLTS involves actions leading to increased self-respect and pride in one's community. It also involves shame and disgust about one's own open defecation behaviors. The concept was developed around the year 2000 by Kamal Kar for rural areas in Bangladesh. CLTS became an established approach around 2011. Non-governmental organizations were often in the lead when CLTS was first introduced in a country. Local governments may reward communities by certifying them with \\"open defecation free\\" (ODF) status. The original concept of CLTS purposefully did not include subsidies for toilets as they might hinder the process. CLTS is practiced in at least 53 countries. CLTS has been adapted to the urban context. It has also been applied to post-emergency and fragile states settings. Challenges associated with CLTS include the risk of human rights infringements within communities, low standards for toilets, and concerns about usage rates in the long-term. CLTS is in principle compatible with a human rights based approach to sanitation but there are bad practice examples in the name of CLTS. More rigorous coaching of CLTS practitioners, government public health staff and local leaders on issues such as stigma, awareness of social norms and pre-existing inequalities are important. People who are disadvantaged should benefit from CLTS programmes as effectively as those who are not disadvantaged. Definitions Open defecation is the practice of defecating out in the open, rather than using a toilet. \\"Open defecation free\\" (ODF) is a central term for community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs. It primarily means the eradication of open defecation in the entire community. However, ODF can also include the additional criteria, such as:Cavill, S. with Chambers, R. and Vernon, N. (2015) ‚ÄòSustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock‚Äô, Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4, Brighton: IDS, , p. 18 * Household latrines or toilets are hygienic, provide the safe containment of feces, offer privacy and a roof to protect the user, have a lid to cover the hole, or a water seal for toilets. * All household members and all members of the community use these latrines or toilets. * A handwashing facility with water, soap or ash is nearby and used regularly. Even more stringent criteria which may be required before a community is awarded \\"ODF status\\" might include: *Safe drinking water and storage. *Food hygiene. *Greywater disposal. *Solid waste management. *Provision of toilets for schools, markets, clinic or visitors to the community. Overview A facilitator and the community during a triggering in Malda District, West Bengal, India School-led total sanitation \\"triggering\\" event: These school children in West Bengal, India are looking at a glass of water and fresh feces. Flies will pass from the water to the feces and back, which demonstrates how water can get polluted with pathogens. This is what CLTS tries to stop: Open defecation in rural Bihar, India CLTS focuses on community-wide behavioural change, rather than merely toilet construction. The process raises the awareness that as long as even a minority continues to defecate in the open, everyone is at risk of disease. CLTS uses community-led methods, such as participatory mapping and analyzing pathways between feces and the mouth (fecal-oral transmission of disease), as a means of teaching the risks associated with OD. A tool called \\"triggering\\" is used to propel people into taking action. This takes place over a day with a team of facilitators.Kal, K and Chambers, R (2008) Handbook on Community-led Total Sanitation , Plan UK Accessed 2015-2-26 The team visits a community which is identified as practicing open defecation and encourages villagers to become aware of their own sanitation situation. This aims to cause disgust in participants, and the facilitators help participants to plan appropriate sanitation facilities. Using the term \\"shit\\" (or other locally used crude words) during triggering events or presentations - rather than feces or excreta - is a deliberate aspect of the CLTS approach, as it is meant to be a practical, straight forward approach rather than a theoretical, academic conversation. CLTS is practiced in at least 53 countries. To be successful in the longer term, CLTS should be treated as part of a larger WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) strategy rather than as a singular solution to changing behavior. Phases Pre-triggering = Pre-triggering is the process by which communities are assessed to be suitable for CLTS intervention. This involves visits and a number of different criteria, which are used to identify communities likely to respond well to triggering. During pre-triggering, facilitators introduce themselves to community members and begin to build a relationship. =Triggering= The \\"CLTS Handbook\\" from 2008 states that there is no \\"one way\\" of doing triggering in CLTS. A rough sequence of steps is given in this handbook which could be followed. Facilitators are encouraged to modify and change activities depending on the local situation. The UNICEF manual approved for use of CLTS in Sierra Leone suggests the following steps for the triggering process:UNICEF (2010). CLTS Training manual for natural leaders - UNICEF and Sierra Leone Government, Freetown, Sierra Leone * Visit the community, emphasising that it is for learning about their sanitation situation * Facilitate 'Kaka Mapping' - which involves drawing the main sites in the village then the main sites for defecation * Pretend to leave * Facilitate the 'Walk of Shame' - walking with community to the sites of Open Defecation * Take a piece of feces in a bag * Put feces on the floor in front of the community and discuss the way flies move between food and feces * Wait for the shocked realization that the community is indirectly eating each other's feces * Put some feces into a water bottle and ask community if they would drink it * Calculate how much feces is produced each day and ask where it goes * Ignition * Wait for the emergence of \\"Natural Leaders\\" to work with in order to develop a plan of action. The idea of the triggering process is to stimulate disgust in the villagers by physical demonstration of the sanitation problems. At the 'ignition' phase, the villagers are expected to realise that there is a real sanitation problem and that they need to do something about it.Philip Vincent Otieno - Defecation mapping in progress CLTS FIRE IGNITED IN DRC Accessed 2015-02-16 Natural Leaders are people from the community who are engaged by the process and who are seen to be people who can drive change.Bongartz, Petra et al. (eds) (2010) \\"Tales of shit: Community-Led Total Sanitation in Africa. Vol. 61. IIED, 2010. Accessed 2015-02-26 Shame and disgust are not reported as universal motivators that triggered communities. Instead, improved health, dignity, and pride are more popular motivators. =Post-triggering= After a positive response to the ignition phase, NGO facilitators work with communities to deliver sanitation services by providing information and guidance relevant to the local situation. There are many challenges that occur in the post-triggering phase. These are mainly related to the supply of durable and affordable latrine hardware and technical support on latrine construction. Toilet owners may need advice how to upgrade and improve sanitation and handwashing facilities using local materials.  Subsidies  The original concept of CLTS did not include subsidies for toilets. CLTS proponents at that time believed that provoking behavior change in the people alone would be sufficient to lead them to take ownership of their own sanitation situation, including paying for and constructing their own toilets. This was not always the case.  Applications to urban situations, schools and other settings  Since about 2016, CLTS has been adapted to the urban context. For example, in Kenya the NGOs Plan and Practical Action have implemented a form of urban CLTS.Kath Pasteur and Preetha Prabhakaran (2014) Lessons in Urban Community Led Total Sanitation from Nakuru, Kenya, implemented by Practical Action and Umande Trust in collaboration with County Government of Nakuru, health services department, CLTS Foundation CLTS has also been used in schools and the surrounding communities, which is referred to as \\"school-led total sanitation\\". The school children act as messengers of change to households. CLTS has also been applied to post-emergency and fragile states settings.Greaves, F. (2016) ‚ÄòCLTS in Post-Emergency and Fragile States Settings‚Äô, Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights 9, Brighton: IDS There has been some experience with this in Haiti, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Philippines and Indonesia. UNICEF has reported in 2014 positive outcomes with CLTS in fragile and insecure contexts, namely in Somalia and South Sudan.UNICEF (2014) CLTS in Fragile and Insecure Contexts: Experience from Somalia and South Sudan, UNICEF WASH Field Note, Eastern and Southern Africa Sanitation and Hygiene Learning Series People who are disadvantaged should benefit from CLTS programmes as effectively as those who are not disadvantaged. This is referred to as equality and nondiscrimination (EQND).House, S., Cavill, S. and Ferron, S. (2017) ‚ÄòEquality and non- discrimination (EQND) in sanitation programmes at scale‚Äô, Part 1 of 2, Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights 10, Brighton: IDS  Outcomes and health aspects  Millions of people worldwide have benefitted from CLTS which has resulted reductions in open defecation and increases in latrine coverage in many rural communities. Practitioners have declared many villages as \\"ODF villages\\", where ODF stands for \\"open defecation free\\".  Reviews of effectiveness  A systematic review of 200 studies concluded in 2018 that the evidence base on CLTS effectiveness is still weak. This means that practitioners, policy makers, and program managers have little available evidence to inform their actions. There is currently a lack of scientific review about the effectiveness of CLTS, although this has been changing since 2015. A study in 2012 reviewed reports by NGOs and practitioners and found that there was little review of the impact of local Natural Leaders, that anecdotes were used without assessing impacts, and that claims were made without supporting evidence.Venkataramanan, V (2012) \\"Systematic Literature Review (Grey Literature) of Publications on Community-led Total Sanitation\\" The Water Institute at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Accessed 2015-02-16 It concluded that these kinds of reports focus on the 'triggering' stage of CTLS instead of the measurable outcomes. A peer-reviewed article considered the sustainability of CLTS in the longer term: It found that there was little monitoring or evaluation of the impacts of CLTS, even though large international organizations were involved in funding the process. Reviews about the effectiveness of CLTS to eliminate open defecation, reduce diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases, and decrease stunting in children are currently underway. In some cases, CLTS has been compared with India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) when assessing the effectiveness of the approach. However, this comparison may be invalid, as the presence of subsidies in the TSC process may fundamentally change the effectiveness of the CLTS process.  Comparison of different CLTS programmes  One small study compared different CLTS programmes. Participants from NGOs involved in delivering CLTS reported that although they included some of the activities described in the guidance materials, they often omitted some and included others depending on the local situation. Some reported that subsidies were included, and some offered specific design and construction options.  Health outcomes  A cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Mali conducted during 2011 to 2013 found that CLTS with no monetary subsidies did not affect diarrhea incidences, but substantially increased child growth (thereby reducing stunting), particularly in children under two years of age. Challenges and difficulties A health worker (centre) gets villagers to draw a map of the area, showing the main features like the road and the river (a village near Lake Malawi, Malawi). Villagers go to the place where meals are prepared to observe how flies are attracted to human feces and carry diseases by landing on the food (village near Lake Malawi, Malawi) Villagers making a transect walk or ‚Äòwalk of shame‚Äô to the open defecation places, singing ‚Äòlet us end open defecation‚Äô (village near Lake Malawi, Malawi)  Human rights  The CLTS behavioral change process is based on the use of shame. This is meant to promote collective consciousness-raising of the severe impacts of open defecation and trigger shock and self-awareness when participants realize the implications of their actions. The triggering process can however infringe the human rights of recipients, even if this was not intended by those promoting CLTS. There have been cases of fines (monetary and non-monetary), withholding of entitlements, public taunting, posting of humiliating pictures and even violence. In some cases CLTS successes might be based on coercion only.Time to Acknowledge the Dirty Truth Behind Community- led Sanitation by Liz Chatterjee in the Guardian On the other hand, CLTS is in principle compatible with a human rights based approach to sanitation but there are bad practice examples in the name of CLTS. More rigorous coaching of CLTS practitioners, government public health officials and local leaders on issues such as stigma, awareness of social norms and pre-existing inequalities are important. Catarina de Alburquerque, the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Water and Sanitation, is quoted as saying that \\"Observers have also recognized that incentives for encouraging behavior change and the construction of latrines are sometimes unacceptable, and include public shaming, including photographing, of those who still practice open defecation.\\" More debate is still needed regarding humans rights consequences of posttriggering punitive measures.  Toilet standards and toilet types  CLTS does not specify technical standards for toilets. This is a benefit in terms of keeping the costs of constructing toilets very low and allowing villagers to start building their own toilets immediately. However, it can produce two problems: first in flood plains or areas near water tables, poorly constructed latrines are likely to contaminate the water table and thus represent little improvement. Second, long-term use of sanitation facilities is related to the pleasantness of the facilities, but dirty overflowing pits are unlikely to be utilised in the longer term.Black, M. and B. Fawcett (2008) The Last Taboo: Opening the Door on the Global Sanitation Crisis. London: Earthscan A related issue here is that CLTS does not address the issue of latrine emptying services or where they exist, how they dispose of waste. This has led some researchers to say that the success of CLTS is largely down to the cultural suitability of the way it is delivered and the degree to which supply-side constraints are addressed. If villagers do not know about alternative toilet options (like urine-diverting dry toilets or composting toilets), and are not told about these options by the facilitators of the CLTS process, they may opt for pour flush pit latrines even in situations where groundwater pollution is a significant problem. = Reuse of treated excreta as fertiliser = Feces are given a strong negative connotation in the CLTS approach. This can cause confusion for villagers who are already using treated human excreta as a fertiliser in agriculture and can, in fact, discourage the reuse of human excreta.  Long-term usage rates (sustainability)  There is also concern about the number of people who go back to open-defecation some months after having been through the CLTS process. A Plan Australia study from 2013 investigated that 116 villages were considered Open Defecation Free (ODF) following CLTS across several countries in Africa.Tyndale-Biscoe, P, Bond, M, Kidd, R (2013) ODF Sustainability Study, Plan Australia After two years, 87% of the 4960 households had fully functioning latrines - but these were considered the most basic and none of the communities had moved up the sanitation ladder. 89% of households had no visible excreta in the vicinity, but only 37% had handwashing facilities present. When broader criteria for declaring communities ODF was used, an overall \\"slippage rate\\" of 92% was found. Some researchers suggest that this means support is needed to support communities to upgrade facilities in ODF villages which have been triggered by CLTS. A study in 2018 has found little evidence for sustained sanitation behavior change as a result of CLTS. History Kamal Kar presented information about CLTS at a meeting of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance in Sweden in 2010 In 1999 and 2000, Kamal Kar was working in a village called Mosmoil in Rajshahi, Bangladesh, and decided that a system of attitudinal changes by villagers might have a longer-lasting effect than the existing top-down approach involving subsidies from NGOs and government. The Bangladeshi government began a programme of installing expensive latrines in the 1970s, but the government decided this was too costly, and many of the original latrines were abandoned.Ahmed, SA (2008) \\"Community Led Total Sanitation in Bangladesh:Chronicles of a People‚Äôs Movement\\" IDS Conference paper Accessed 2015-02-27 In the 1990s, a social mobilisation plan was begun to encourage people to demand and install better sanitation systems, but early success did not last, according to Kar. At that point Kar, a participatory development expert from India, was brought in by Wateraid and he concluded that the problem with previous approaches was that local people had not \\"internalised\\" the demand for sanitation. He suggested a new approach: abandoning subsidies and appealing to the better nature of villagers and their sense of self-disgust to bring about change. The CTLS Foundation is the organisation set up by Kar to promote these ideas. Kar and Robert Chambers stated in their 2008 CLTS Handbook: In time, NGOs and governments began to see the value of the approach and ran their own schemes in various countries, some with less aversion to subsidies than Kamal Kar. Community-led Total Sanitation as an idea had grown beyond its founder and is now often being run in slightly different ways, e.g. in India, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Zambia. Non-governmental organizations were often in the lead when CLTS was first introduced in a country. India was an exception - here the government led the somewhat similar \\"Total Sanitation Campaign\\" which has been turned into the \\"Clean India Mission\\" or Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in 2014. It eventually became standard practice for NGOs to leave the community quite soon after \\"triggering\\" activities. When communities took the lead, change in sanitation practices was more longer term and sustainable. CLTS as an idea now has many supporters around the world, with Robert Chambers, co-writer of the CLTS Foundation Handbook, describing it this way: The Institute of Development Studies (IDS) coordinated research programme on CLTS since about 2007 and regards it as a \\"radically different approach to rural sanitation in developing countries which has shown promising successes where traditional rural sanitation programmes have failed\\".'Beyond Subsidies - Triggering a Revolution in Rural Sanitation' Institute of Development Studies (IDS) In Focus Policy Brief 10 July 2009. Today there are many NGOs and research institutes with an interest in CLTS, including for example the CLTS Knowledge Hub of the Institute of Development Studies, the CLTS Foundation led by Kamal Kar, The World Bank,WEPA (2013) Community-based Sanitation lessons learned from Sanimas Programme in Indonesia Accessed 2015-03-04 Wateraid,WaterAid (2011) Revitalising Community-led Total Sanitation: A process guide.

Large INGOs and many national NGOs have also been involved. Many governments have in the meantime initiated CLTS processes or made it a matter of national policy. The concept originally focused mainly on provoking shame and disgust about open defecation. It also involved actions leading to increased self-respect and pride in one's community. With time, CLTS evolved away from provoking negative emotions to educating people about how open defecation increases the risk of disease. Currently, CLTS triggering events focus more on promoting self-respect and pride.

Peter Gusenberg participated in an infamous attack on Al Capone during a vicious gang war. Early life Peter Gusenberg Jr. was born at the Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois to Peter Sr. and his wife. He was the firstborn of three sons and the namesake of his father Peter Gusenberg (Gusenberger) Sr. who was a first generation Roman Catholic emigrant from Gusenburg, a municipality in the Trier-Saarburg district, in Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany and his wife. His parents moved into a home at 434 Roscoe Street in Lakeview, Chicago where Peter lived with his brothers Frank (October 11, 1893 Chicago, Illinois) along with their youngest brother Henry who later moved to 5507 Bernice Avenue, Portage Park, Chicago. In 1901, when Peter Jr. was twelve years old, he returned home from school and found his mother on the floor, dead. Following this discovery, he pried off his mothers wedding ring, which Peter Sr. had bought for her back in Germany, and pawned it. After graduating from petty crime into more serious offenses, the Gusenberg brothers teamed up with Dean O'Banion, Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss, George \\"Bugs\\" Moran and other members of the North Side Gang. Although Peter Jr. and his brother had little formal education, they both learnt to speak German and English. He later married a German-Irish woman Myrtle Coppleman Gorman and did not let her know about his criminal activities, keeping her under the ruse that he worked as a travelling salesman. He was first incarcerated in 1902 and sent to the Joliet Correctional Center for burglary in 1906. He was released on a probationary period but violated the terms and conditions of his probation and was sent back to Joliet in 1910 and re-released in 1912. He 1923 he was convicted for his participation in helping rob a mail freight car while stopped at Dearborn Station. He also helped carry out the murders on Antonio Lombardo and Pasquale Lolorado with his younger brother Frank Gusenberg and Albert Kachellek, a fellow cellmate at Joliet. The Gusenberg brothers and Kachellek were killed in the St Valentine's day Massacre February 14, 1929 Prison time In the early 1920s, Peter Gusenberg was sent to the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth on a mail robbery conviction. While he was in prison, the North Side Gang became embroiled in a vicious gang war with the rival Chicago Outfit, headed first by Johnny Torrio and then Al Capone. During this warfare, Outfit gunmen had murdered North Side leader O'Banion in his florist shop. When Peter Gusenberg was released from prison in 1926, he rejoined the North Side Gang, now led by Hymie Weiss, in its war against the Outfit. Gang war On September 20, 1926, Peter Gusenberg participated in the infamous drive-by shooting on the Hawthorne Hotel, Capone's Cicero, Illinois headquarters. The North Siders riddled the hotel with thousands of bullets. According to many accounts, the second to last car stopped in front of the hotel restaurant when Peter Gusenberg emerged, clad in a khaki Army shirt and brown overalls, and carrying a Thompson submachine gun. Kneeling in front of the doorway, Gusenberg emptied the entire 100-round capacity drum into the restaurant, and then casually strolled back to his car, which then sped off. The attack left Capone terrified and he offered a truce between the two gangs. Peace talks faltered on the concessions that the North Siders demanded. As the gang war continued, the North Side Gang started to weaken. Three weeks after the Hawthorne Hotel attack, Hymie Weiss was murdered by a Capone hit squad. Moran now took over the gang. The North Siders especially wanted to kill Jack \\"Machine Gun\\" McGurn, as he was rumored to have killed Weiss. On at least two occasions, the Gusenberg brothers tried to kill McGurn. Despite wounding him several times, McGurn survived these attempts on his life. By late 1928, Moran struck an alliance with Capone rival Joe Aiello. Aiello and the Gusenberg brothers first killed Antonio Lombardo and then Pasqualino \\"Patsy\\" Lolordo, two successive presidents of the Unione Siciliane and both Capone allies. It was these murders that motivated Capone to eliminate Moran and the North Side Gang in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. On February 14, 1929, the upper echelon of the North Side gang, including Peter Gusenberg, gathered at the S.M.C. Cartage Company at 2122 N. Clark Street in the Mid-North District neighborhood. Also there were Frank Gusenberg, Albert Weinshank, Adam Heyer, James Clark, John May, and Dr. Reinhardt Schwimmer (a friend of a gang member). The general accepted story is that the North Siders were waiting for a shipment of hijacked Log Cabin brand whiskey from Detroit (a ploy devised by Capone). However, this story has been disputed. Two men in Chicago police uniforms entered the garage and lined Peter Gusenberg and the other North Siders against the north wall. At this point, two men in civilian clothing entered from the rear carrying submachine guns. The four gunmen then opened fire with submachine guns and shotguns, killing all seven men, in what became known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Peter Gusenberg died kneeling in a chair. Peter's brother Frank was the only initial survivor of the massacre. When police asked who had shot him, Frank replied, \\"No one shot me.\\" He died later that night. Although the killers wiped out most of the North Side Gang, they missed their prime target, Bugs Moran. Moran had pulled up to the garage just as the shooters were entering. Because they were dressed as policemen, Moran assumed it was a raid and fled the area. In popular culture Peter has been portrayed three times in film: * by George Segal in the 1967 film, The St. Valentine's Day Massacre * by Martin Kove in the 1975 film, Capone. * by Ryan Kiser in the 2017 film Gangster Land. The Gusenberg Sweeper is a Grand Theft Auto V version of the Tommy Gun, featured in the Valentine's Day Massacre Special. It is named after the Gusenberg Brothers.

Biography=Early life John, a nobleman, was born in his family's castle in Wildeshausen, Westphalia about 1180, where he received his early education. When he was of age, he went to Bologna to advance his studies. The records show that he showed himself to have an extremely agile mind and winning personality. This is shown in the fast friendship John forged with the teenaged Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II when they met during a stay Frederick made while returning home from a diplomatic mission, sometime about 1212. This was despite a significant disparity in age between them. John accompanied Frederick back to their homeland, where he joined the imperial court. It would appear that court life did not agree with John, as he soon returned to Bologna, where he came to know the Dominican Order. Despite his age and standing (possibly already having received Holy Orders), John was eager to join in the new enterprise, and received the Dominican habit from the founder of the Order, St. Dominic himself, who possibly then also professed him at the same time. This was in either late 1219 or early 1220. He was almost immediately sent out to preach, in keeping with Dominic's vision of mission of the Order, especially since John was already known as an eloquent preacher, equally fluent in Latin, Italian and French, as well as his native German. John wandered through northern Italy, France and Germany, as far as Austria, preaching the Gospel everywhere he went, traveling entirely on foot, though he was already advanced in age for his era. After this tour, he settled in Strasbourg as his base. Provincial and bishop In 1224 he was called to Rome by Pope Honorius III, where he was named an Apostolic Penitentiary and assigned to accompany the Cistercian cardinal Conrad of Urach in preaching a crusade to the Holy Land in southern Germany.John of Wildeshausen Bishop And Master General While on this mission, John mediated in a longstanding conflict between the Stedingen and the Archbishop of Bremen, Gerhard II. He was sent back on the same mission with another papal legate, Cardinal Otho di Monferrato, later that same year. Upon his return to Rome, John was then assigned to join his friend and fellow Dominican, Paul of Hungary, to serve as Prior Provincial of the new province Paul had founded for his homeland, a post in which John served from about 1231 to 1233. At that point, due to the removal from office of the incumbent due to heresy, he was named bishop of Bosnia (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) by the papal legate, the Cistercian cardinal James of Pecorara, a position he accepted only under religious obedience. John would travel his extensive diocese on foot, leading, or driving ahead of him, a little ass which carried his books and vestments. He was at once bishop and missionary. His preaching was incessant; his charity inexhaustible. On himself he spent next to nothing, for he regarded the revenues of his diocese as the property of the poor, and there were many within his jurisdiction. He was given valuable assistance by King Coloman, the Duke of Slavonia (brother of the popular saint, Elizabeth of Hungary). John served in this post from 1233 to 1237, when, after repeated requests, he was allowed to retire by Pope Gregory IX. John was so eager to relinquish the office, that he renounced any pension to which he was entitled from the diocese, and returned to his monastery in Strasbourg. John was not to rest in his retirement, as he was almost immediately sent in 1237 as an envoy of Pope Gregory IX to the Bulgarian Prince Asen II. The following year, the General Chapter of the Order met in Bologna at Pentecost, in the course of which the capitulars chose John as Prior Provincial of Lombardy, a post in which he served from 1238 to 1240. This was not a position which offered rest, as friars of that Province were actively opposed to the political ambitions of John's old friend, the Emperor Frederick, who was seeking control of the entire Italian peninsula. Additionally, they were loyal to the Pope, who was engaged in widespread hostilities with Frederick over competing territorial claims. As John was a subject of the Emperor, it was a particularly difficult spot for him. Just as in the start of their friendship, the fact that John was able to walk a fine line which never angered either side in the struggle again attested to his capacity for being able to work with all. Master General In 1240, the incumbent Master General of the Order, Raymond of Penyafort, resigned the office. Thus, when the next General Chapter met in Paris on 19 May 1241, choosing his successor was at the head of their agenda. John attended the Chapter in his capacity as Prior Provincial. To his surprise and dismay, they chose him. Among his many achievements during his administration was the continued policy of fidelity to the Papacy without needless criticism of secular rulers. He oversaw the completion of liturgical texts proper to the Order. He traveled throughout Europe visiting the different monasteries of the Order, still traveling on foot, with just his staff for support. He preached in five languages, and had good relations with the papal Curia. Under his lead, the General Chapters decided two important changes in the Constitutions: The General Chapters would no longer alternate only between Bologna and Paris, but, by agreement, they were to be held: 1245 in Cologne, 1247 in Montpellier, 1249 in Trier and 1250 in London. The university monopoly of Paris was broken and from 1248 new general houses of study were established in Montpellier, Bologna, Cologne and Oxford. John provided for the standardization of the Dominican liturgy; and gave the Order a firmer structure. He particularly promoted the missions and study. Death In obedience to a command of Pope Innocent IV, John accompanied the first Dominican cardinal, Hugh of St-Cher, to Germany subsequent to the death of Emperor Frederick. While there, overestimating his strength, he preached vigorously, as was his custom. This time, however, the strain proved too much for him and he collapsed. John was brought back to his old base by Strasbourg, and there he died on 4 November 1252. He was initially buried in the church of the first monastery of the friars by Strasbourg, which was outside the walls of the city. By 1260, a new priory had been built within the city proper, one dedicated to St. Bartholomew. The General Chapter was held there that year, in the course of which John's remains were transported to the new church and re-interred there. John was considered a saint during his life, and after death was venerated as saint, both within the Order and without. Documents were drawn up by his successor, Humbert of Romans, with the goal of seeking his canonization. His cause, however, never succeeded in Rome. In the 16th century, in the course of the Protestant Revolution, the Dominican church where he was entombed was seized by Huguenots, and the interior was gutted, to be used for their purposes.

It was established as part of Queensland Premier Ted Theodore's ambitious Dawson River Irrigation Scheme which failed to eventuate. It was originally known as Castle Creek, but that name is now used by another locality in the area. Geography Theodore is situated on the Dawson River just off the Leichhardt Highway north-west of the state capital, Brisbane. Castle Creek flows through the town and into the Dawson River immediately south of the town centre. History The Aboriginal inhabitants of the area were the Gangulu people. Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. The first European settler in the district was Joseph Thompson who amassed a number of pastoral leases from 1850 to his death in 1857, including Oxtrack Creek, Okangal, Coteeda, Delusion Creek, Macoom, Hope, Thalba and Woolthorpe. He entered a partnership with James Reid who acquired the Boam run and acquired Thompson's runs after his death and then acquired further runs, before beginning to sell out to new settlers. In 1864 a town called Woolthorpe was surveyed and town lots offered for sale, but few were sold and no town developed at that time. In 1893, William Woolrych acquired of land alongside the Dawson River and gradually built it up through further land acquisitions into the very large Woolthorpe Station. Dawson River Irrigation Scheme In 1905, the Queensland Minister for Lands Joshua Thomas Bell and fellow Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Robert Herbertson conducted a tour of the district. Herbertson reported that Woolthorpe was \\"a splendid property, consisting of downs and black soil flats\\" used for sheep grazing. Herbertson also reported favourably on an experiment to raise lucerne by irrigating of cleared land beside the Dawson River. His opinion was that there was plenty of water available in the Dawson River for irrigation and the land could grow almost any crop. Herbertson believed that, with irrigation, the district would be capable of supporting a large population, provided there was cheap, easy and quick transport to the coast. This comment about transport followed Minister Bell's earlier criticism of the condition of the roads west of Gladstone which were the responsibility of the Banana Shire and the Taroom Shire. The idea of a major irrigation scheme involving the Dawson River continued to be considered by the Queensland Parliament over a number of years. However, it was not until February 1920, that the Premier of Queensland Ted Theodore announced his support for a Dawson River irrigation scheme. Later that year, in September 1920, Ted Theodore announced that a dam would be built at The Gorge on the Dawson River () enabling of fertile land to be created through irrigation along of the Dawson River. The irrigated area would be organised into five zones: Isla, Castle Creek (later Theodore), Huon, Moura and Coolibah, with each zone having a central township. There would be irrigated farms closer to the river and dry (non-irrigated) blocks further away. It was estimated that there would be about 5000 farms and that, together with those living in the towns providing services to the farmers, the irrigation scheme would support about 50,000 people. Each town would be a \\"model garden city\\" as the local population would be sufficient to enable all modern amenities and recreational facilities; this was seen as important to attract younger people, who were believed to be abandoning rural towns in favour of cities to which many had been exposed during the Great War. In 1922 it was announced that the gorge and the dam would both be named after Matthew Nathan, the (then) Governor of Queensland. The dam would be the second largest in the world, submerging over and capable of storing 2,485,000 acre feet (3.065 cubic kilometres) of water. (For comparison, the present day Wivenhoe Dam has an area of 109.4 square kilometres and a capacity of 2.61 cubic kilometres). Also in 1922, it was announced that, in addition to the dam, the Dawson Valley Irrigation scheme would include the construction of a railway line to service the Dawson Valley. The funding for the overall scheme was to be through a loan from America for approximately ¬£2.5 million. Creating the town of Theodore As it would take some time to build the Nathan Dam, it was decided to commence on a smaller scale by initiating the Castle Creek irrigation zone by building a small low-cost weir nearby on the Dawson River, from which water would be pumped along canals to the irrigated farms. A power station was also built beside the river. The land offered for initial settlement was 264 irrigated farms of average size and 109 dry blocks of average size . The town was initially called Castle Creek after the local railway station, which in turn took its name from the creek which flowed into the Dawson River just south of the town. However, in November 1926, it was renamed in honour of Ted Theodore, who as Premier of Queensland had given so much support to the irrigation scheme. Theodore State School, 2014 Theodore State School opened on 6 May 1924. The Castle Creek receiving office opened on 1 December 1924, but was upgraded to a post office on 15 December 1924. It was renamed Theodore Post Office on 1 July 1927. The Hotel Theodore was originally built as a boarding house to accommodate new residents to the district. Country Women's Association hall, 2014 The Theodore branch of the Country Women's Association was established in about 1928. In 1932, they opened their original rest rooms in Theodore in 1923 at a cost of ¬£113. On 21 February 1953, their current hall on The Boulevard was opened. The land was donated and the building cost ¬£3,000. It is painted in the traditional blue-and-white colours of the CWA. The Theodore Public Library was opened in 1959.  Postponement of Nathan Dam  However, Ted Theodore never obtained funding for the Nathan Dam and in 1925 he resigned as Queensland Premier in order to move into federal parliament. In 1933, the Nathan Dam was postponed for 25 years. Without the water needed for irrigation, many of the small farm blocks around Theodore became economically unviable and many sold at a loss. This enabled others to enlarge their holdings to a size where it became possible to support a family with dry farming. However, with fewer families, the population estimates used for Theodore's planning could not be achieved in practice, making many aspects of the town's existing and planned infrastructure economically unviable to the disappointment of the settlers attracted by the government's promotional material of a model garden city. In 2006, the Queensland Government announced that the Nathan Dam was the preferred short-to-medium-term water supply solution for the district to meet the needs of the growing mining activity in the Surat Basin but indicated that only existing agricultural users would be supplied, suggesting there is no plan to revive the Dawson River Irrigation Scheme more generally. The dam was originally intended to be operational by 2014. In 2009, environmental impact studies discovered that half of the already endangered Boggomoss snail (Adclarkia dawsonensis) population would be within the inundation area of the dam. A mitigation strategy would be to relocate those snail communities to other suitable habitats outside the inundation area. A trial relocation project was established but required three years to complete as the success criteria require that relocated snail communities successful breed and rear young for two generations. This trial would delay the project by at least two years. Later in 2009, SunWater claimed other studies of the snails discovered 18,000 snails in other unidentified locations, reducing the concern about the population in the inundation area and allowing the dam project to resume. However, as at August 2015, the Queensland Government still lists the snail as \\"endangered in Queensland\\" with only two population groups. Although the Environmental Impact Statement for the dam was completed in 2012, changes to the proposed route of the pipeline in 2013 meant the environmental impact statement had to be revised. As at November 2015, the revised EIS had not been released for public comment. Flooding In March 2010 the Dawson River flooded, causing significant economic damage to the town. On 28 December 2010, a second flood forced evacuation of the town, with the level of the Dawson River exceeding 14.6 metres. At the , Theodore had a population of 452. Economy The town's economy is closely linked to coal mining ‚Äì Theodore is at the southern end of Queensland's coal-rich Bowen Basin.  Education  Theodore State School is a coeducational school catering for Prep ‚Äì year 10. The school motto is 'Learn with a will'. At the time of the 2015 Annual Report, Theodore State School had 120 students enrolled. Transport Theodore Airport, 2014 Theodore has an airport, Theodore Airport but no regular scheduled services operate from it. The community has raised funds to install solar-powered lighting so the runway can be used for medical emergency flights at night. Amenities Library, Theodore, 2014 The Banana Shire Council operates a library on The Boulevard in Theodore.

Venture capital and high tech companies rushed to build next generation infrastructure equipment for the expected explosion of internet traffic. As part of that investment fever, network processors were seen as a method of dealing with the desire for more network services and the ever-increasing data-rates of communication networks. It has been estimated that dozens of start-up companies were created in the race to build the processors that would be a component of the next generation telecommunications equipment.

Experts maintain that the Muslim Satya Pir and the Hindu Satyanarayan Puja essentially represent the same beliefs and rituals. A century ago in Bengal, the ritual called, pujah was mainly performed by Hindu women and was interchangeably called Satya pir Pujah or Satya Narayan pujah. According to the author, Dwijendra Nath Neogi, some Muslims at that time also performed the pujah. The author gives alternate theories as to how Pir and Narayan got associated. In one theory, he proposes that Brahmins during the Islamic era in Bengal changed Narayan into Pir in order for the Muslims to believe that they were worshipping an Islamic saint. The other theory says the worship started as that of a Muslim saint or Pir and later the Pir was changed into Narayan. In folklores, Narayan and Pir get mixed such as one supplicant will address him as Satya Narayana, implying that he is an avatar of Krishna, while another one in a different tale will be told that Satya Pir has just come from Mecca, which would make him Muslim. In Orissa, the state adjacent to Bengal, Sufism gained popularity and led to the emergence of the Satya-Pir tradition. Even today Hindus worship Satyanarayan and pir together.

Based on the National Magazine Award-winning Washingtonian magazine article \\"Like Something the Lord Made\\" by Katie McCabe, the film was directed by Joseph Sargent and written by Peter Silverman and Robert Caswell. Plot summary Something the Lord Made tells the story of the 34-year partnership that begins in Depression Era Nashville in 1930 when Blalock (Alan Rickman) hires Thomas (Mos Def) as an assistant at his Vanderbilt University lab, expecting him to perform janitorial work. But Thomas' remarkable manual dexterity and intellectual acumen confound Blalock's expectations, and Thomas rapidly becomes indispensable as a research partner to Blalock in his forays into heart surgery. The film traces the two men's work when they move in 1943 from Vanderbilt to Johns Hopkins, an institution where the only black employees are janitors and where Thomas must enter by the back door. Together, they attack the congenital heart defect of Tetralogy of Fallot, also known as Blue Baby Syndrome, and in so doing they open the field of heart surgery. Helen Taussig (Mary Stuart Masterson), the pediatrician/cardiologist at Johns Hopkins, challenges Blalock to come up with a surgical solution for her Blue Babies. She needs a new for them to oxygenate their blood. The duo is seen experimenting on stray dogs they got from the local dog pound, deliberately giving the dogs the heart defect and trying to solve it. The outcome looks good and they are excited to operate on a baby with the defect, but in a dream, Thomas sees the baby grown up and crying because she's dying. Thomas asks why she's dying in the dream and she says it's because she has a baby heart. Blalock interprets it as the fact that their sewing technique didn't work because the sutures didn't grow with the heart, and worked on a new version that would work. The film dramatizes Blalock's and Thomas' fight to save the dying Blue Babies. Blalock praises Thomas' surgical skill as being \\"like something the Lord made\\", and insists that Thomas coach him through the first Blue Baby surgery over the protests of Hopkins administrators. Yet outside the lab, they are separated by the prevailing racism of the time. Blalock makes a mistake once by accidentally cutting an artery at the wrong place, but eventually, along with Thomas, succeeds. Thomas attends Blalock's parties as a bartender, moonlighting for extra income, and when Blalock is honored for the Blue Baby work at the segregated Belvedere Hotel, Thomas is not among the invited guests. Instead, he watches from behind a potted palm at the rear of the ballroom. From there, he listens to Blalock give credit to the other doctors who assisted in the work but make no mention of Thomas or his contributions. The next day, Thomas reveals that he saw the ceremony, and quits from his lab. However his heart is so with the work he left behind that he finds himself unhappy in other endeavors and decides to overlook Blalock's lack of acknowledgement and return to the lab. In 1964, one day before Blalock dies, he sees Thomas, now a professional surgeon and trainer in the open heart surgery wing. After Blalock's death, Thomas continued his work at Johns Hopkins training surgeons. At the end of the film, in a formal ceremony in 1976, Hopkins recognized Thomas' work and awarded him an honorary doctorate. A portrait of Thomas was placed on the walls of Johns Hopkins next to Blalock's portrait, which had been hung there years earlier. and a brief montage shows 'DR. ALFRED BLALOCK 1899-1964' over Blalock's portrait, and 'DR. VIVIEN THOMAS: 1910-1985' over Thomas's.

Dutton as William Thomas * Mary Stuart Masterson as Dr. Helen B. Taussig Film background A man who in life avoided the limelight, Thomas remained virtually unknown outside the circle of Hopkins surgeons he trained. Thomas' story was first brought to public attention by Washington writer Katie McCabe, who learned of his work with Blalock on the day of his death in a 1985 interview with a prominent Washington, D.C. surgeon who described Thomas as \\"an absolute legend.\\" McCabe's 1989 Washingtonian magazine article on Thomas, \\"Like Something the Lord Made\\", generated widespread interest in the story and inspired the making of a 2003 public television documentary on Thomas and Blalock, \\"Partners of the Heart.\\" A Washington, D.C. dentist, Dr. Irving Sorkin, discovered McCabe's article and brought it to Hollywood, where it was developed into the film.

Released through Universal, the film stars John Forsythe and newcomer Ann-Margret, and features Peter Brown, Patricia Barry and Richard Anderson. The film was made to publicize Ann-Margret as a serious actress. Her previous films, Viva Las Vegas and Bye Bye Birdie, were of the musical genre and did little to highlight her dramatic skills. Her management signed her to several different films at this time, each with a top Hollywood studio, and she was not consulted on the projects they had chosen for her. In interviews, Ann-Margret made the best of the situation, claiming she was hoping to distance herself from her \\"new Marilyn Monroe\\" image. Decades later, the film would be selected for riffing in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Kevin Killian's 2008 book of poetry Action Kylie features \\"Kitten With A Whipe\\", a poem inspired by the film and featuring its two main characters. Plot The wife of prospective politician David Stratton (John Forsythe) is away in San Francisco, visiting relatives there. David comes home one night but not to an empty house‚Äîa young woman, Jody (Ann-Margret), is asleep in his daughter's bed. Jody has just escaped from a juvenile detention home, where she stabbed a matron and started a fire. Though David is furious and wishes to call the police, Jody tells him a tale of woe and he is sympathetic. He buys her a dress, gives her some money and puts her on a bus. Soon after, David learns that Jody is a wanted fugitive who had been lying to him. He returns home to find Jody there. She refuses to leave and threatens to create a scandal if he forces her out. Worried about his political fortunes, David is forced to let her stay. Jody invites three friends to the house, including two ruffians, Ron and Buck, who bully David into letting them throw a wild party in the house. The youths begin to fight until Ron suffers a deep cut in the arm with a razor. They drive across the Mexico border, taking David along. They deposit Ron with a local doctor and ditch Buck when the car is entangled in barbed wire. Jody and David end up in a Tijuana motel. When Ron and Buck return, a chase occurs and their car crashes, killing them both. David, seriously injured, awakens in the hospital to find that just before she died, Jody had told the authorities that she had been in the car with Ron and Buck, meaning that David is in the clear.

Universal bought the film rights in 1959 and assigned Robert Arthur to produce. The following year, Richard Rush was reported to be developing the project, with Nancy Kwan cast in the starring role. However, the film did not materialize at the time. When plans for a screen adaptation were revived, the lead role was originally offered to Brigitte Bardot, but she turned it down. In October 1963, Ann-Margret was announced as the star. She was paid $150,000 plus a percentage of the profits. Filming started in December 1963, with Douglas Heyes as writer and director and Harry Keller as producer.  Reception  New York Times reviewer Eugene Archer was critical of the film's premise, stating of Forsythe's character, \\"At almost any point in the proceedings he could have solved the problem‚Äîand ended the movie‚Äîby simply walking away and calling one of his influential friends.\\" However, Archer praised Ann-Margret's performance: \\"With little help from Donald Heyes, who directed his own foolish script, she demonstrates enough untrained talent to suggest interesting dramatic possibilities in better films.\\" Writing in the Los Angeles Times, critic Margaret Harford decried the film's \\"violence-for- violence's sake\\" and wrote of the ending, \\"The problem was how to end it all and Heyes took the coward's way out. Everybody dies a violent death except Forsythe who goes back to his wife and will probably run for governor. There's a message here somewhere but I'm not going to work overtime figuring it out for you.\\" See also *List of American films of 1964 *List of films featuring home invasions ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1964 films Category:1964 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American crime drama films Category:American neo-noir films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:Home invasions in film Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Works published under a pseudonym Category:1964 drama films ","title":"Kitten with a Whip"},{"id":"4155654","text":"Ljuba (Serbian Cyrillic: –â—É–±–∞, ) is a village located in Syrmia, Vojvodina, Serbia.

Liminal beings are naturally ambiguous, challenging the cultural networks of social classification. Liminal entities The cultural anthropologist Victor Turner considered that liminal entities, such as those undergoing initiation rites, often appeared in the form of monsters, so as to represent the co-presence of opposites‚Äîhigh/low; good/bad‚Äîin the liminal experience. Liminal personas are structurally and socially invisible, having left one set of classifications and not yet entered another. The social anthropologist Mary Douglas has highlighted the dangerous aspects of such liminal beings, but they are also potentially beneficent. Thus we often find presiding over a ritual's liminal stage a semi-human shaman figure, or a powerful mentor with animal aspects, such as a centaur.Aniela Jaffe and Joseph Henderson, in C. G. Jung ed., Man and his Symbols (London 1968 p. 261-2 and p. 101 Legendary By extension, liminal beings of a mixed, hybrid nature appear regularly in myth, legend and fantasy. A legendary liminal being is a legendary creature that combines two distinct states of simultaneous existence within one physical body. This unique perspective may provide the liminal being with wisdom and the ability to instruct, making them suitable mentors, whilst also making them dangerous and uncanny. Many beings in fantasy and folklore exist in liminal states impossible in actual beings: Hybrids (two species): * Centaurs from classical mythology, among them Chiron, the mentor of Achilles *Tritons from classical mythology, half-human sea beasts[Gilmore, David D.

History The village originates from the late 19th century, when the local land owner Odescalchi employed people from Baƒçki Petrovac and Glo≈æan, Slovak villages across the Danube, in order to satisfy growing timber export. At first, they resided seasonally and returned to their villages. In order to ensure more permanent work force, they offered them cleared forest land as loan, at the location of the later village.

He promoted participatory rural development in Pakistan and other developing countries, and widely advocated community participation in development. His particular contribution was the establishment of a comprehensive project for rural development, the Comilla Model (1959). It earned him the Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Philippines and an honorary Doctorate of law from Michigan State University. In the 1980s he started a bottom-up community development initiative of Orangi Pilot Project, based in the outskirts of Karachi, which became a model of participatory development initiatives. He also directed many programmes, from microcredit to self-finance and from housing provision to family planning, for rural communities and urban slums. It earned him international recognition and high honours in Pakistan. Khan was fluent in at least seven languages and dialects. Apart from many scholarly books and articles, he also published a collection of poems and travelogues in Urdu. Early life Khan was born on 15 July 1914 in Agra. He was among the four sons and three daughters of Khansaahib Ameer Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum.Yousaf (2003), p. 338. His father, a police inspector, was inspired by the reformist thinking of Syed Ahmed Khan. In his early age, Khan's mother introduced him to the poetry of Maulana Hali and Muhammad Iqbal, the sermons of Abul Kalam Azad, and the Sufist philosophy of Rumi. This upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social, economic, and political affairs.Hasan (1996), pp. xiii‚Äìxiv. Khan attended Government High School at Jalam (Uttar Pradesh), and completed his education in 1930 at Agra College where he studied English literature and history. He read English literature, history, and philosophy for a Bachelor of Arts degree at Meerut College in 1932. At that point, his mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis. She died in the same year at the age of 36.Yousaf (2003), pp. 339‚Äì340. Khan continued his studies and was awarded a Master of Arts in English Literature from Agra University in 1934. He worked as a lecturer at Meerut College before joining the Indian Civil Service (ICS) in 1936.Yousaf (2003), p. 345. As part of the ICS training, he was sent to read literature and history at Magdalene College, Cambridge, England. During the stay, he developed a close friendship with Choudhary Rahmat Ali.Yousaf (2003), p. 346. Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest daughter of Allama Mashriqi) in 1940. Together, they had three daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha.Yousaf (2003), pp. 342‚Äì43. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal.Yousaf (2003), p. 347. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, \\"I realised that if I did not escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig.\\"BARD (1983), p. xii. During this period, he was influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism.Hussain, I (2006). \\"A cause worth serving\\". DAWN Magazine. 24 December. Retrieved 22 May 2015. According to Khan, \\"I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict. ... when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished.\\"Khan (1996), p. 23. For the next two years, Khan worked in Mamoola village near Aligarh as a labourer and locksmith, an experience that provided him with firsthand knowledge of the problems and issues of rural communities. In 1947, he took up a teaching position at the Jamia Millia, Delhi, where he worked for three years. In 1950, Khan migrated to Pakistan to teach at Islamia College, Karachi. In the same year, he was invited by the Government of Pakistan to take charge as Principal of Comilla Victoria College in East Pakistan, a position he held until 1958. During this time (1950‚Äì58) he also served as President of the East Pakistan Non-Government Teachers' Association.Yousaf (2003), p. 348. Rural development initiatives During his tenure as principal of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed a special interest in grassroots actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme.V-AID was a government level attempt to promote citizens participation in the sphere of rural development in East and West Pakistan. It was launched in 1953 with technical assistance from the US government. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers.Chaudhuri (1969), p. 316. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in rural development.Yousaf (2003), p. 349. Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of law by Michigan State University.Yousaf (2003), pp. 370‚Äì74. In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with Arthur Lewis.Yousaf (2003), pp. 350‚Äì51. On his return to East Pakistan, Khan remained attached to the Comilla Project until 1971 when East Pakistan became Bangladesh. Eventually, Khan moved to Pakistan. PARD was renamed as Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (BARD).Khan spent a significant part of his life in Comilla. His residence was located in the Ranir Dighir Par area of the town, adjacent to Victoria College where he taught for a long time. As a gesture of respect for his contributions to the community, the Comilla-Kotbari road in Bangladesh was named after him. Advisory roles Following his move to Pakistan, Khan was asked to implement the Comilla Model in rural settlements of North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Punjab, and Sindh. He declined the offer on the grounds that the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development, such as participatory irrigation management.NRSP (2000), pp. 4‚Äì6. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at Karachi University from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a visiting professor in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the Rural Development Academy at Bogra in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, Peshawar, on the Daudzai Integrated Rural Development Programme. He also travelled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant on rural development programmes across the world.Yousaf (2003), p. 352. In 1974, he was appointed as a World Bank consultant to survey rural development situations in Java, Indonesia. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at Lund University, Harvard University, and the University of Oxford.Yousaf (2003), pp. 352‚Äì53. In 1980, Khan moved to Karachi and started working on the improvement of sanitary conditions in Karachi suburbs. He laid the foundations of the Orangi Pilot Project for the largest squatter community of Orangi in the city. He remained associated with this project until his death in 1999. Meanwhile, he maintained his support for rural communities around Karachi, and also helped to develop the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme. OPP became a model for participatory bottom-up development initiatives.Uphoff, Norman (2001) Dr Akhter Hameed Khan: An Appreciation. Published in Yousaf (2003), pp. 409‚Äì13. Major development programmes=Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's initiative in response to the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development.Bhuiyani, A.H.A. et al. (2005). Developmentalism as a Disciplinary Strategy in Bangladesh. Modern Asian Studies Vol. 39, No. 2. pp. 349‚Äì368. Retrieved 3 May 2008. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation.Raper (1970), p. vi. Initially, the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID.Yousaf (2003), pp. 370‚Äì71. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.This helped to raise the annual yield of rice crops from 20 maunds (about 750 kilograms) per acre to 60 maunds (2,240 kilograms) per acre (Yousaf 2003, p. 371) Comilla Model simultaneously addressed the problems that were caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes.Khan, A.R.

Retrieved 6 May 2008. The initiatives included the establishment of: a training and development centre; a road-drainage embankment works programme; a decentralized, small scale irrigation programme; and, a two-tiered cooperative system with primary cooperatives operating in the villages, and federations operating at sub-district level.BARD (1983), Vol. II, p. 190. After Khan's departure from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because only a few occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds.Chowdhury (1990), p. 54. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'.Dowla and Barua (2006), p. 18. However, Khan's leadership skills during the course of his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.Valsan (2005), p. 49.

Retrieved 22 May 2015. The successful OPP model became an inspiration for other municipalities around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider civic co-operation.Hasan (2002), pp. 199‚Äì216. The success of OPP did come at a cost for Dr Khan as his liberal views and self-help initiatives were questioned and criticised by certain interest groups. At two occasions, he was accused of blasphemy. However, all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars.

Route San Fernando Road starts off in Castaic as The Old Road, passing through Santa Clarita, where it is a major frontage road for Interstate 5. The name is considered amusing by local residents, who have styled some traffic signs along the road using a faux Old English typeface. The Old Road reaches as far as Newhall Pass, whereupon its intersection with Sierra Highway near the junction of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) and the Antelope Valley Freeway (SR 14), it becomes San Fernando Road.

From the intersection with the Ventura Freeway (SR 134) to its southern terminus, the street closely follows the Los Angeles River through the Atwater Village, Glassell Park, and Cypress Park neighborhoods. North of Figueroa Street, San Fernando Road splits with Avenue 26, and passes under the Arroyo Seco Parkway at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco. San Fernando Road ends at the Pasadena Avenue intersection, where it becomes Avenue 20, which ends 5 blocks later at North Main Street, near Downtown Los Angeles. History Some intersections along San Fernando Road have these signs posted to remind drivers this street used to be US 99 Prior to the construction of Interstate 5, San Fernando Road was old U.S. Route 99 and U.S. Route 6. With the completion of the Golden State Freeway, it was re-signed as State Route 163 in the 1960s and Business Interstate 5 in the 1970s. Today, San Fernando Road is used as an alternative to Interstate 5 between Lincoln Heights and the Newhall Pass, due to the relatively few traffic signals on the route. Local Transportation Metro Local lines 94 and 224 run along San Fernando Road, as well as Metro Rapid line 794 and Glendale Transit lines 7 and 12. Other uses There was another San Fernando Road entirely within the city of Santa Clarita starting only 2¬Ω miles north of the northern end of the original San Fernando Road. San Fernando Road in Santa Clarita has now been renamed and split into 3 different streets (from south to north): Newhall Avenue, Main Street, and Railroad Avenue. The route formerly carried the easternmost segment of SR 126. San Fernando Road should also not be confused with the nearby San Fernando Mission Boulevard. The two roads intersect in the City of San Fernando about a mile from the San Fernando Mission. The former Southern Pacific Railroad follows both portions of San Fernando Road for their entire routes.

Cabo Polonio has no roads leading to it and is located about 7 km from the main highway. It is accessible by walking through the dunes or by 4x4 vehicles. The region has no electricity or running water for the few houses of this town, and wind power and a few generators are used to power some of the posadas and grocery store. There is a lighthouse that gets power from the national grid. Residents obtain water from nearby water wells or collecting rain water. Population According to the 2011 census, it had a population of 95 inhabitants. Features Cabo Polonio sits on the tip of a peninsula that extends into the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean side of the peninsula experiences strong waves, while the bay interior to the peninsula is sheltered. At the top end, a lighthouse stands over boulders tumbling into the sea. Three small, rocky islands dot the coast nearby. Near to the village is a colony of sea lions. The shore also has mobile sand dunes, in which the sand is blown by the wind and the dunes change their position over time. The village land is shared by the Uruguayan government and private owners.

Washington lived a large part of her life in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where many monuments were erected in her honor and a university plus other public buildings bear her name. Early life Mary Ball Washington House, 1200 Charles Street, Fredericksburg, by Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1927. The house was originally built in 1761 and has later additions. Mary Ball was born sometime between 1707 and 1709 at either Epping Forest, her family's plantation in Lancaster County, Virginia or at a plantation near the village of Simonson, Virginia. She was the only child of Col. Joseph Ball (1649-1711) and his second wife, Mary Johnson Ball. Joseph was born in England and emigrated to Virginia as a child.George Washington: A Biographical Companion - By Frank E. Grizzard Fatherless at three and orphaned at twelve, Mary Ball was placed under the guardianship of George Eskridge, a lawyer, in accordance with the terms of her mother's will, for whom her son George Washington, was named, consistent with the naming conventions at the time.See the appendix of the book Albion's Seed by David Hackett Fischer for an insightful discussion of four naming conventions in use at the time in Great Britain. Her paternal grandfather was William Ball (1615-c.1680); he left England for Virginia in the 1650s. His wife Hannah Atherold arrived later along with their four children, including Mary's father Joseph. Married life Augustine Washington had sailed to Britain on business (and to visit his sons who had been sent to school there) but on his return, he discovered that his first wife, Jane Butler Washington, had died in the interim. George Eskridge supposedly arranged an introduction between his friend, Washington, and his ward Mary Ball, with the two marrying on March 6, 1731 when she was 22. She was wealthy by the standards of the day and brought at least 1000 acres of inherited property to the marriage. The couple had the following children: * George Washington (1732‚Äì1799), the first President of the United States, who married Martha Dandridge * Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Washington (1733‚Äì1797), who married Fielding Lewis * Samuel Washington (1734‚Äì1781), who married five times * John Augustine Washington (1736‚Äì1787), who married Hannah Bushrod * Charles Washington (1738‚Äì1799), who married Mildred Thornton * Mildred Washington (1739‚Äì1740), who died young. Augustine died in 1743 when son George was 11 years old. On his deathbed, \\"Gus\\" gave his son George three books on prayer. In some of those books, now in the Lyceum in Boston, Mary Ball Washington, also wrote her name. Unlike most widows in Virginia at the time, Mary Ball Washington never remarried. When George was 14, his older half-brother Lawrence Washington, who commanded a unit of Virginia Militia that served on board with British Admiral Edward Vernon, for whom Mount Vernon was named, arranged for young George to become a British Navy Midshipman. However, Mary's highly respected half-brother, Joseph Ball, under whom the Virginia House of Burgesses had voted money to pay the cost for Virginia's young men to go study for the ministry, wrote a reply to her letter requesting advice, wherein he said do not allow your son George to join the British Navy, for they will \\"...treat him worse than a slave or a dog.\\" Mary managed the family estate and 276 acres of Ferry Farm (a plantation) with the help of others until her eldest son came of age and well beyond. She lived to see that her son, George Washington, commanded the Continental Army to independence and be inaugurated as the first President of the United States in 1789. After learning that he had been elected president in April 1789, George Washington traveled from Mount Vernon to visit his mother in Fredericksburg. He was accompanied by Martha Washington's grandson George Washington Parke Custis. George Washington knew his Mother was ill. She was suffering from breast cancer, the disease to which she eventually succumbed, but, he sought her blessing as he embarked on another service to his Country: the new concept of \\"The Presidency of the United States.\\" Here, as popularly told, the stories and lore‚Äîprobably begun and perpetuated by Custis‚Äîtake over. It is said that Mrs. Washington informed her son of her poor health and expected to die soon. Further, the story continues, that her son, George, said that he would need to decline to serve as president. George's mother Mary responded, saying \\"But go, George, fulfill the high destinies which Heaven appears to have intended for you for; go, my son, and may that Heaven‚Äôs and a mother‚Äôs blessing be with you always.\\" This purely legendary account is frequently cited as true, but cannot be verified. What can be documented is that he received her approval and, of course, left Fredericksburg and made his way to New York City where he was inaugurated at the end of April. Death After a lengthy illness, on August 25, 1789, Mary Ball Washington died of breast cancer at her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Beliefs While there is a legend that Mrs. Washington was said to be openly opposed to her son's revolutionary politics and, according to French officers based in Virginia during the war, she was a Loyalist sympathizer,George Washington: A Life by Willard Stearne Randall (1997). New York: Henry Holt and Company, Inc. page 440. there is no credible source to support that legend. The facts are that other than her son George who was Commander in Chief of the Continental forces (Army and Navy), Mary's other three sons Samuel, John Augustine, and Charles, all served in the Virginia Militia. Her son-in-law Fielding Lewis (husband to her daughter Betty), was in charge of the Fredericksburg Gunnery or Gun Manufactory. The gunnery works made muskets for use by American Revolutionary forces, and ended up almost bankrupting Lewis in the process. Mary Washington was by no means poor despite the fact that she petitioned the Government of Virginia claiming, in response to a Virginia government notice to citizens to do so, asking to be reimbursed for farm animals, horses and cattle that she gave to support the American war effort. Her son, George, purchased her a fine house in Fredericksburg, four blocks from some \\"Prayer Rocks\\" Mary frequented to pray for her children and only two blocks from Kenmore, where George's sister Betty (Mrs. Fielding Lewis) lived. Mary lived in her home nearby from 1772 until her death in 1789, but George also arranged for water from the \\"medicine springs\\" on the Ferry Farm property, her home for many years, to be brought to his mother in town each day. In her will, Mary Washington left George the majority of her lands and appointed him as her executor. Mary Washington frequently visited her daughter Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" and her husband Fielding Lewis at their Kenmore Plantation two blocks from her home in Fredericksburg. She had a favorite \\"prayer rock\\" that was close to the Lewis mansion. Tradition has it that this was her favorite retreat for reading and prayer. She asked Betty to bury her there after her death, and her daughter arranged that. Descendants Her third son, John Augustine Washington, was the father of Bushrod Washington, who was nominated by President John Adams to the U.S. Supreme Court, and confirmed by the Senate in 1798, while his Uncle George was living in retirement at Mount Vernon. Charles Town, West Virginia, is named for her fourth son, Charles Washington. The national capital and many other cities, towns and villages are named \\"Washington\\" for her first son, George Washington. Legacy and honors *Several monuments have been erected to Mary Ball Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where she lived from 1772 until her death in 1789. *The Mary Washington House in Fredericksburg has been preserved by Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) who, in mid-2012, signed an agreement passing ownership to the \\"Washington Heritage Museums.\\" The residence is open to the public and operated as a historic house museum. It contains a fine collection of antique furnishings, some with Washington family provenance. *Mary Ball Washington is buried on the grounds of Kenmore, the former home of her daughter and son-in-law Fielding and Betty Lewis. Kenmore is operated as a house museum and is open regularly for public tours. *A monument to Mary Ball Washington was erected in 1833 and dedicated by President Andrew Jackson. It was left unfinished until the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, a women's organization formed in the late nineteenth century raised money for the monument. The Mary Washington Memorial Association used social events and balls to raise money for the cause. The new memorial was dedicated by President Grover Cleveland in 1894 at her grave site. *The University of Mary Washington, a public university in Fredericksburg, Virginia, was named for her. *The Mary Washington Hospital, located in Fredericksburg, is named for her. *In November 2019, the Fredericksburg Nationals minor league baseball team introduced a Mary Washington logo at an event at the Mary Washington House on her 311th birthday, describing the logo as \\"the first female logo in baseball history to be a part of a team's permanent and original branding.\\" See also * Mary Washington House * Mary Ball Washington Museum and Library * The SS Mary Ball was a World War II Liberty ship. * Washington family NotesFurther reading * External links *His \\"Revered Mother\\" at HistoryPoint.org *The Mary Washington House on the APVA Preservation Virginia website *Oh, Mother! - *The Life and Legacy of the \\"Grandmother of our Country\\" * Category:1700s births Category:1789 deaths Category:18th-century American Episcopalians Category:British North American Anglicans Category:Colonial American women Category:Mothers of Presidents of the United States Category:People from Fredericksburg, Virginia Category:People from Lancaster County, Virginia Category:People from Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:Virginia colonial people Category:Washington family ","title":"Mary Ball Washington"},{"id":"4155870","text":"First City Tower, which has the headquarters of Waste Management A Waste Management trash collection truck in Toronto, Ontario.

Summary of Competitive Analysis. \\"The three largest national companies, Waste Management, Allied Waste and Republic Services together handle more than half the solid waste generated in the United States today.\\" [and Allied and Republic have since merged] History In 1893, Harm Huizenga, a Dutch immigrant, began hauling garbage at $1.25/wagon in Chicago. In 1968, Wayne Huizenga, Dean Buntrock, and Larry Beck founded Waste Management, Inc. and began aggressively purchasing many of the smaller garbage collection services across the country, as the descendant firm of Harm Huizenga. In 1971, Waste Management went public, and by 1972, the company had made 133 acquisitions with $82 million in revenue. It had 60,000 commercial and industrial accounts and 600,000 residential customers in 19 states and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In the 1980s, Waste Management acquired Service Corporation of America (SCA) to become the largest waste hauler in the country. Between the years of 1976 and 1997, the executive officers of Waste Management, Inc. began \\"cooking\\" the accounting books by refusing to record expenses necessary to write off the costs of unsuccessful and abandoned landfill development projects; establishing inflated environmental reserves (liabilities) in connection with acquisitions so that the excess reserves could be used to avoid recording unrelated operating expenses, improperly capitalizing a variety of expenses; failing to establish sufficient reserves (liabilities) to pay for income taxes and other expenses; avoiding depreciation expenses on their garbage trucks by both assigning unsupported and inflating salvage values and extending their useful lives; assigned arbitrary salvage values to other assets that previously had no salvage value; failed to record expenses for decreases in the value of landfills as they were filled with waste, used netting to eliminate approximately $490 million in current period operating expenses and accumulated prior period accounting misstatements by offsetting them against unrelated one-time gains on the sale or exchange of assets; and used geography entries to move tens of millions of dollars between various line items on the company's income statement. Officers were accused of making \\"the financials look the way we want to show them.\\" The top officers settled with the federal government for $30.8 million in 2005, without admitting guilt. In 1993, Waste Management, Inc. changes to WMX Technologies, Inc. As a universal symbol of the other services they provided other than solid waste removal, recycling, and disposal. When a new CEO took charge of the company in 1997, he ordered a review of the company's accounting practices in 1997. In 1998 Waste Management restated its 1992-1997 earnings by $1.7 billion, making it the largest restatement in history. In 1998, in a pivotal development point, Waste Management merged with USA Waste Services, Inc. USA Waste Services CEO John E, Drury retained the chairman, and CEO position of the combined company. Waste Management then relocated its headquarters from Chicago to Houston. The merged company retained the Waste Management brand. In late 1999, John Drury stepped down as chairman due to brain surgery. Rodney R. Proto then took the position of chairman and CEO. Unfortunately, that year also brought trouble for the newly expanded company in the form of an accounting scandal. In November 1999, turn-around CE was brought in to help Waste Management recover. The company has since implemented new technologies, safety standards, and operational practices and is on a steady upward climb. On July 14, 2008, Waste Management offered a $34 per share all-cash bid to acquire arch-competitor Republic Services, Inc. On August 11, 2008, the bid was raised to $37 per share. On August 15, 2008, Republic Services, Inc. denied Waste Management's bid for a second time. On October 13, 2008, Waste Management withdrew its bid for Republic Services, citing financial market turmoil. In January 2009, a global economic crisis forced Waste Management to aggressively reduce and restructure its corporate workforce. On February 7, 2010, CBS debuted a new TV series called Undercover Boss after the Super Bowl. Waste Management COO Lawrence O'Donnell III participated in this first episode and got a chance to see up close the inner workings of the company he helped run. O'Donnell left Waste Management on July 1, 2010. In 2015, Winters Brothers assumed all of WM's operations in Connecticut and New York (excluding New York City, and continues to service these regions under contract with WM.WM operations Waste Management also sponsored the #14 car of Sterling Marlin in 2006 until 2007 in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. USA Waste Services Inc In 1987, USA Waste was founded in Oklahoma by Don Moorehead and moved the headquarters to Dallas, Texas, after buying out local haulers. After John Drury, CEO of BFI, got in a dispute with William Ruckelshaus, Drury left. He later became a part of USA Waste Services. He acquired Mid-American Waste Systems with co-founder George Moorehead; that boosted USA Waste. In 1994, USA Waste acquired TransAmerican Waste Industries from Tom J. Fatjo, former CEO and founder of BFI. In 1995 USA Waste acquired Sanifill, and Rodney Proto then become COO of USA Waste Services. USA Waste Services, Inc., moved into Sanifill's headquarters in Houston, Texas. Later in 1995, USA Waste acquired the assets of Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in Canada, after the Laidlaw acquisition. In 1996 USA Waste Services acquired Kosti Shirvanian hauler Western Waste Industries, which put USA Waste right behind number 1 hauler WMX Technologies, Inc., and number 2 Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. Kosti now served on USA Waste's board of directors. Early in 1997, USA Waste acquired both BFI's and WMX's Canadian assets. In mid-1997, USA Waste acquired Bradley S. Jacobs's hauler United Waste Systems. Jacobs sold to USA Waste and did not become a part of USA Waste. In 1998, USA Waste acquired City Management Corp. in MI. Later in 1998, John Drury and USA Waste Services, Inc., and hauler WMX Technologies, Inc. merged. John Drury took the CEO position. John Drury retired the name USA Waste and kept the name Waste Management, Inc., after the merger. Drury then retired the WMX Buntrock Burgundy to USA Waste's gold and green. The logo is also a mirror image of USA Waste's U logo. In April 2000, Drury died. Rodney Proto then took over CEO of the new Waste Management. He was then fired by the executives. Then Larry O'Donnell, a former USA Waste executive, took over as chief operating officer. Corporate structure and leadership Waste Management is structured into the following units: *North Tier **Jeff Harris, senior vice president *South Tier **John Morris, senior vice president Current members of the board of directors of Waste Management are: James C. Fish, Jr. - president and chief executive officer Frank M. Clark, Jr. - retired chairman and chief executive officer, ComEd Andr√©s R.

James C Fish, Jr. is the chief executive officer of the company since 2016, succeeding David P. Steiner. In February 2018, James E. Trevathan and Jeff Harris notified the company that they plan to retire at the end of year. Subsidiaries *Waste Management Recycle America **Mr. James C. Fish Jr., President Recycling Waste Management currently manages the recycling of more than 8.5 million tons of materials, including metal, plastic, glass, electronics and paper at 128 facilities. One service provided by Waste Management, single-stream recycling, allows recyclable materials to be comingled, rather than separated by the customer and handled separately by the collection provider. The company currently operates 30 single-stream recycling facilities throughout North America. Because the single-stream recycling process eliminates the need for customers to separate items before they are collected, it usually leads to higher recycling participation rates in local communities. Electronics recycling, or ecycling, is another focus for Waste Management. This refers to the proper disposal of electronic items like televisions, computers, microwave ovens, cellular phones, VCRs and DVDs and other such products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) encourages consumers to reuse and recycle these valuable products to keep them out of the waste stream. With this in mind, Waste Management has partnered with several companies, like LG Electronics, to recycle electronics for reprocessing. The company operates approximately 150 e-cycling centers throughout the country through its subsidiary, WM Recycle America. It January 2010, the company announced that WM Recycle America was implementing the Responsible Recycling (R2) Program for electronics recyclers, which establishes accepted practices to help protect the environment and workers' health and safety while e-waste is handled. In addition these practices allow third parties to monitor activity and create greater transparency in the e-cycling sector. Waste Management has also invested in new methods and technologies for reusing and recycling non-traditional materials, such as organic waste and construction debris. In 2010, Waste Management announced two strategic investments to advance recycling technologies in North America: * In January 2010, Waste Management announced it would fund Boston-area company Harvest Power, which specializes in turning food and yard waste into compost. Harvest Power is also working to develop anaerobic digester technology that uses waste to create a biogas, which can produce electricity, heat or be converted to natural gas. * In May 2010, Waste Management announced its investment in MicroGREEN Polymers Inc., which specializes in reducing the amount plastic required for production of consumer products, like plastic bottles. In June 2009, Waste Management signed an agreement with BigBelly Solar to be the sole waste company distributor of BigBelly's technology in North America. BigBelly compactors are self-powered by built-in solar panels and are capable of holding 180 gallons of waste. The compactors decrease the need for trash pickup by 80 percent, which reduces production costs, fuel use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Waste Management Solar Compactors became a staple at the Waste Management Phoenix Open; the company replaced FBR as the title sponsor of this PGA TOUR tournament in December 2009. As title sponsor, Waste Management introduced a variety of technologies to make the Phoenix Open one of the most eco-friendly tournaments on the PGA TOUR. Waste Management has been working with other sports and music venues across the nation to increase recycling among patrons. It teamed up with Live Nation to forward the Recycling Rocks! campaign across the U.S. Additionally, its subsidiaries GreenOps, LLC and Greenopolis placed recycling kiosks in front of grocery stores and collected more than 4,000,000 bottles and cans. Waste Management then partnered with PepsiCo to use that technology to develop the Dream Machine recycling initiative to increase beverage container recycling throughout the U.S. Dream Machine kiosks are computerized recycling receptacles that include a personal reward system that allows users to accumulate and redeem points for every item they recycle at www.greenopolis.com. Waste Management is also involved in landfill gas utilization, including landfill-gas-to-energy (LFGTE) production. The company has over 115 LFGTE facilities, and plans to add another 60 facilities by 2012. LFGTE facilities collect methane and carbon dioxide gases emitted during the natural anaerobic decomposition of organic waste in the landfill. These gases are then used to fuel engines or turbines that generate electricity to power surrounding areas. In August 2009, Waste Management announced that it would join Valero Energy Corporation as a strategic investor in Terrabon L.L.C.'s waste-to-fuel conversion technology. Waste Management will also assist Terrabon in securing organic waste streams. Terrabon specializes in refining municipal solid wastes and sewage sludge into non-hazardous organic salts. The organic salts are then sent to Valero where it can be converted into gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. Around this same time, Waste Management launched a joint venture with Oregon-based company InEnTec to form S4 Energy Solutions. S4 uses a process called plasma gasification (also known as plasma arc waste disposal) to heat waste materials until they break down to produce a synthesis gas, or syngas. The syngas can be converted into transportation fuels, such as ethanol or diesel, or can be used as a substitute for natural-gas heating and electricity. In February 2010, Waste Management announced a strategic investment agreement with Enerkem Inc., a Canadian-based company that specializes in converting waste materials that are most often landfilled, such as carbon-based feedstock, municipal solid waste, construction and demolition wood and agricultural and forest residues, into biofuels like ethanol. The investment signifies Waste Management's continued efforts to invest in upcoming green technologies and to double its renewable energy production. International In 2009, Waste Management purchased a 40-percent stake in Shanghai Environment Group Co Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanghai Chengtou Holding Co Ltd. SEG sought Waste Management's investment in order to benefit from Waste Management's experience in the waste disposal field, as well as improve their technology for waste disposal. Corporate issues= 1995 lawsuit  Shareholders sued Wheelabrator Technologies's (WTI) board of directors for breach of their fiduciary duty, challenging the merger of WTI into Waste Management. In 1995, the case, In re Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc. Shareholders Litigation, came before the Court of Chancery of Delaware on an appeal regarding the Board's motion for summary judgment. The shareholders argued the Board breached their duty of care because there was not sufficient process, they didn't look at alternative transactions, didn't consider information regarding waste's legal liabilities, they didn't appoint a committee of independent directors to negotiate the merger, and they didn't adequately consider the terms of the merger; they breached their duty of loyalty, and; they breached their duty to disclose relevant information regarding the merger. Ultimately, the court dismissed the duty of disclosure claim but allowed the duty of loyalty claim to a degree. In regards to the duty of loyalty claim, the court disagreed with both the shareholders and the Board. It labelled the merger as an interested transaction, not a controlled shareholder transaction, so the business judgment rule applies and the burden to prove waste is on the shareholders.Jarrod Shobe, Lecture on Fiduciary Duty, BYU Law (Nov 2017). Accounting improprieties Revelations of irregular accounting led to a major drop in stock price and to the replacement of top executives after a new CEO ordered a review of the company's accounting practices in 1998. Waste Management's shareholders lost more than $6 billion in the market value of their investments when the stock price plummeted by more than 33%. The company had augmented the depreciation time length for their property, plant, and equipment, artificially inflating the company's after-tax profits by US$1.7 billion. On July 8, 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed against WMI and its certains officers for issuing false statements. Waste Management paid US$457 million to settle a shareholder class-action suit in 2003. The SEC fined Waste Management's independent auditor, Arthur Andersen, US$7 million for its role. ERP software implementation failure In 2005, Waste Management entered into a Software Licensing Agreement (SLA) with SAP AG. Under the agreement, SAP and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tomorrow Now, were to implement SAP's Enterprise Resource Planning software. The implementation began when an 8 months pilot program was established in Waste Management's New Mexico market area, the market-share area at the time. This initial implementation was to be followed in two months with a company- wide implementation from Waste Management's headquarters in Houston, Texas. In December 2007, Waste Management ended their ERP implementation effort. Waste Management characterized the ERP implementation as non-functional. An SAP sponsored \\"Solution Review\\" determined that a customized ERP, based upon an updated SAP ERP, would need to be made in order to accommodate a company-wide implementation. Waste Management sued SAP for the US$100 million to recover the funds it had spent on the failed ERP implementation. In the lawsuit, Waste Management accused SAP of fraud and deception. SAP countered that Waste Management failed to present knowledgeable workers and accurate business models and failed to migrate data from legacy systems. The suit concluded in 2010 under confidential terms and a one time payment from SAP to Waste Management disclosed to the SEC. Labor relations In 2007, Waste Management locked out Teamsters at its largest hauling operation in Alameda County, CA. The lockout lasted a little less than a month and put 900 members of the Teamsters, ILWU, and Machinists Union on picket lines and raised concerns over sanitary impact on the affected communities. The lockout was stopped when affected communities started legal actions against Waste Management. According to Waste Management officials, the company worked over the past three months to negotiate an agreement fair to both Waste Management and the union. The union did not want to negotiate over the company's proposals and refused to offer their own proposal unless Waste Management agreed to withdraw all proposals from the table. Oakland's City Council reached a settlement with Waste Management over the dispute in March, 2008. The company rebated more than $3 million to customers and Oakland customers will receive additional services over the next five years. Environmental record Waste Management's operations consist of environmental protection, groundwater protection, environmental engineering, and air and gas management. Waste Management currently operates ten full-scale waste treatment landfill projects in the U.S. and Canada. As a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), Waste Management made a commitment during the pilot phase to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by four percent below the average of its 1998‚Äì2001 baseline by 2006. They have also replaced nearly 500 diesel-fueled trucks with vehicles that run on 100 percent natural gas. These new garbage and recycling trucks comprise one of the nation's largest fleets of heavy-duty trucks powered exclusively by natural gas.WM: 2006 Sustainability Report In November 2009, at Waste Management's Altamont Landfill, a new plant began producing 13,000 gallons a day of clean-burning LNG fuel from methane gas from the landfill that had fueled an electric power plant since 1969. Waste Management has said that the plant, announced in April 2008, and built and operated by The Linde Group with state funding, is the world's largest facility to convert landfill gas into vehicle fuel. Waste Management works with environmental groups in the U.S. to set aside land to create and manage wetlands and wildlife habitats. The company's landfills currently provide approximately of protected land for wildlife; 73 landfills are certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council. In May 2011, Waste Management's Wheelabrator division agreed to pay a record $7.5 million settlement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a host of environmental violations at its plants in North Andover, Saugus, and Millbury, Massachusetts. The settlement was announced on May 2, 2011 by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and Attorney General Martha Coakley's office. Marketing The current slogan is \\"From everyday collection, to environmental protection, think green. Think Waste Management.\\" They also are featured in a Walt Disney World Epcot attraction, Innoventions. Waste Management has also tried to soften its impact on communities through public relations, such as its 2011 renaming of Mount Trashmore in northern Broward County, Florida, from the \\"North Broward County Resource Recovery and Central Disposal Sanitary Landfill\\" to the \\"Monarch Hill Renewable Energy Park.\\" Television In February 2010, Waste Management was the first company featured on CBS television series Undercover Boss. Chief Operating Officer Lawrence (Larry) O'Donnell, III learned of many policies he introduced but wished to change to improve the working environment of his employees. In one example, route supervisors sometimes observe garbage collecting to monitor quality, productivity and adherence to safety rules. Some garbage collectors perceived this as spying, a characterization that disturbed O'Donnell. In another example, O'Donnell chose to end the practice of deduction of pay for time clock rules violations during the lunch hour. O'Donnell personally intervened in the career of an administrative assistant he met while filming the series. The administrative assistant had put her family's house up for sale due to lack of sufficient income despite working two jobs. O'Donnell promoted the employee to a supervisor position, which included a higher rate of pay and bonus eligibility, thus allowing her to keep the house. Product placement The Waste Management brand is featured in several recent films. Waste Management vehicles and equipment are featured prominently in several scenes in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In the film, one character transforms from a robot into a Waste Management collection vehicle. A Waste Management branded roll-off box can be seen in the background of a scene in the 2009 film Paul Blart: Mall Cop and a character dressed as a Waste Management employee appears in the film, The Spy Next Door. A Mack TerraPro truck owned by Waste Management that transforms into three Junkheaps appears in Transformers: Age of Extinction. Restatement On November 14, 1997, the company reclassified or adjusted certain items in its financial statements for 1996 and the first nine months of 1997. On August 3, 1999, the company would have to restate first-quarter results downward, partly because of changes in the value of landfills and other assets in connection with its acquisition last year of Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.

Studios titles ","title":"Planet of the Apes (comics)"},{"id":"4155936","text":"El Tiradito is a shrine and popular local spot located at 420 South Main Avenue in the Old Barrio area of Downtown Tucson, Arizona. The shrine consists of the crumbling remains of a brick building, with a large metal rack for candles and desert plants now occupying the interior. Large, glass-encased candles, frequently depicting saints of the Roman Catholic Church are lit and left burning at the shrine, both on the stand and along the ledges of the building. Small slips of paper containing prayers or messages of thanks are also often pressed into cracks in the walls or left elsewhere at the shrine, as are other memorial objects. In addition to the faithful who leave these religious objects, El Tiradito is frequented and favored by many Tucsonans, including writers, poets, and other members of the town's artistic community. According to the Phoenix New Times publication, El Tiradito is the only Catholic shrine in the United States dedicated to a sinner buried in unconsecrated ground. It is said that the man buried there died fighting for the love of a woman. Visitors to this area light candles for the man, hoping his soul will be freed from purgatory. Some of the nooks and crannies of El Tiradito even house the notes and letters of the heartbroken, prayers asking for healing of the heart. History Juan Oliveras, a recently married 18 year old at the time, was the son-in-law of a Mexican Sheep Rancher. Juan has been locally considered as a sort of part 'folk hero and part myth' for over 140 years. His death resulted from a very steamy secret love affair with his Mother-In-Law, the wife of a very powerful, wealthy sheep rancher in the area. The Barrio Viejo is often referred to as the real \\"soul\\" of Tucson, though much of its Spanish Colonial architecture was bulldozed to make way for the City of Tucson Convention Center. Juan's shrine was responsible for stopping the government's plans for a freeway that would have destroyed and gone right through what is now left of the Barrio Viejo. Only a well loved martyr could be worthy of such constant homage as seen in this small shrine. Votive candles, prayers and wishes have been delivered every night for over 140 years to El Tiradito (the little throwaway or castaway), Oliveras' shrine, by faithful Tucson believers and thousands of others. Juan Oliveras is not a saint, like any of those made by the Catholic Church in Rome. The shrine's little grotto actually owes its existence to Juan Oliveras' steamy secret adulterous love affair with his mother-in-law. \\"He was a sinner, and a lover\\" said Annie Laos, 74, who led the fight to have the El Tiradito Shrine placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. \\"El Tiradito Is A Shrine To A Bad Guy,\\" she said. But the sins of this 18-year-old ranch hand, who was often seen frequenting Tucson downtown during the 1870s, while he was employed on his father-in-law's sheep ranch, north of the town, were sins of his heart, mind, and his actions with a married woman, who was no less than his own mother-in-law. El Tiradito is a story of the west, a curse, and a love triangle. Juan Oliveras was in love with his mother-in-law. El Tiradito, also known as the Wishing Shrine, is the burial site of the lovesick Oliveras. Juan, his young wife, and his wife's father, all lived on the father-in-law's large sheep ranch. Juan had become infatuated with his mother-in-law, who lived in her husband's large main home in Tucson.  Murders and Suicides  One day Juan went into town to secretly visit his beautiful mother-in-law. That same day, his rancher father-in-law also went into town on business and surprised his wife and son-in-law having sex in the rancher's own bed. After many strong words and accusations, a violent fight ensued. Juan got free and fled out the front door yelling for help. But his enraged ax-wielding father- in-law soon caught up to the young man and began attacking him, hitting him repeatedly with the sharp axe blade until Juan died in a large pool of his own blood in the dirt street. The blood-spattered father-in-law fled, and, knowing he would hang for the murder if he was caught, saddled up his best horse and quickly made his escape in a 60-mile ride down to Sonora Mexico before the Tucson Marshals could arrest him. The rancher's wife was so despondent that she committed suicide. She was found hanging from her balcony that night by a passing freight wagon. The murderer made it to Sonora M√©xico, but within days he attempted to return to his Tucson area ranch to herd his animals down to Sonora. Riding his horse on the trail north, up to Tucson, near Tubac he was attacked by a band of Apache Indian raiders. They scalped him, stabbed him, shot him repeatedly, took his guns, took his horse, took his clothes, and tied him naked to a large saguaro cactus along the Nogales to Tucson wagon trail, to die. By morning the southbound stagecoach going from Tucson down to Nogales came upon the gruesome sight of the barely recognizable dead man. His body was cut down from the giant saguaro cactus, wrapped up in a canvass tarp, and lashed down on the back freight area of the stagecoach, which continued on its scheduled run down to Nogales, Sonora, where the body was buried. Despite pleas to the Tucson Catholic Church officials from some of the barrio's residents, the Catholic Church refused Juan Oliveras burial on church- sanctioned or owned cemeteries due to the adulterous nature of the young man's sins with the married woman while he himself was also already married to another woman. Instead, Juan was buried on the exact spot where his body was thrown by his enraged father-in-law after he had hacked him to death with the axe. That act gave the present site its name, El Tiradito, ('The Little Throwaway'... 'The Castaway.') Soon, the weight of the multiple tragedies of the deaths of both of her parents and her spouse, as well as the betrayal by her husband and mother drove Juan's own young widow to desperation and beyond. Pregnant with Juan's child, and now living mostly alone on the nearly abandoned ranch north of Tucson, that had belonged to her dead parents; she untied the bucket from the rope going down into the ranch's deep water well. The beautiful widow tied the rope snugly around her neck, climbed onto the large rocks surrounding the well, and jumped down into it, snapping her neck instantly. Neighboring ranchers found her limp body almost a week later when they visited the ranch to ask her if she wanted any help to move into Tucson. Her body was buried right there on the ranch next to a large old mesquite tree that remains to this day. The 'Curse of The Wishing Shrine' centers predominately on its visitors' motives for their visit, and their own lives. It is said that if one visits with a clear open heart that forgives, they will pass, and they may even get their wish fulfilled. For others, it may just be the beginning of history repeating itself, depending on what they themselves bring to the shrine. Also, it is said that if you light a candle at the shrine and it remains burning all night long without going out by sunrise, your wish may be granted, depending on your motivations.http://www.tucsonmuseum.org/shrinecurse.htm ReferencesExternal links *A photograph of the shrine * Category:Buildings and structures in Tucson, Arizona Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:Historic American Landscapes Survey in Arizona Category:Tourist attractions in Tucson, Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Tucson, Arizona Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1871 *A very good, up close and personal video of the El Tiradito Shrine ","title":"El Tiradito"},{"id":"4155943","text":"HMS Pelorus (pennant number: J291) was an built for the Royal Navy (RN) during World War II. Upon completion, the ship became the flotilla leader of the 7th Minesweeper Flotilla, clearing mines off the east coast of England. In June 1944, the flotilla was assigned to sweep one of the beaches during the Normandy landings until she struck a mine the following month. After her repairs were completed, Pelorus was reassigned to the English Channel and the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla. The flotilla was transferred to the Indian Ocean in 1945 and spent some time escorting convoys. They participated in Operation Collie, a bombardment of Japanese positions in the Nicobar Islands, in July and then swept the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore in August. After the war, she was sold to the South African Navy and renamed HMSAS Pietermaritzburg. The ship was later converted into a midshipmans' training ship during the early 1960s. She served as a barracks ship from 1968 to 1991 when Pietermaritzburg was listed for disposal. The ship was scuttled as an artificial reef off the South African coast in 1994.  Description  Pelorus displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of which gave a maximum speed of . The ship carried enough fuel oil that she had a range of at . The ship was armed with a single 4-inch (102 mm) Mk V dual-purpose gun and four single mounts for Oerlikon light anti- aircraft (AA) guns.du Toit, p. 182 For anti-submarine work, Pelorus was fitted with two depth charge rails, and four depth charge throwers. The ship was equipped with a Type 271 surface-search radar and a Type 291 air-search radar. Her crew numbered 85 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 261 During the war the two single Oerlikon mounts on the bridge wings were replaced by twin power- driven mounts and the two remaining single mounts aft were superseded by two single Bofors AA guns before the ship sailed for the Far East. In preparation for her reclassification as a training ship, Pietermaritzburg had her sweeping gear removed and was rearmed with her main armament replaced by a twin-gun turret fitted with more powerful 4-inch Mk XVI guns in 1961‚Äì62. The Bofors guns were moved to the roof of the enlarged aft superstructure.Gardiner, Chumbley & Budzbon, p. 336 Her complement now consisted of 8 officers, 73 ratings, 10 midshipmen and 50 trainees.du Toit, p. 184 She was refitted in 1971.Moore, p. 280 Construction and career Pelorus was named after Pelorus Jack, a Risso's dolphin that often escorted ships through French Pass in New Zealand.du Toit, p. 183 The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of Renfrew, Scotland and laid down on 8 October. She was launched on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October.Lenton, p. 263 The ship was assigned to the newly formed 7th Minesweeping Flotilla upon completion and served as the flotilla leader. The flotilla was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned to sweep the minefields protecting Juno Beach during the Normandy landings. Pelorus led the flotilla on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet. While sweeping the approaches to Cherbourg, she struck a mine that damaged the port engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla at Plymouth when they were completed. The flotilla sailed for the Far East on 8 April 1945 and was assigned convoy escort duties on arrival. On 2 July, they swept the approaches to the Nicobar Islands during Operation Collie and destroyed 167 mines. As the Pacific War was ending on 15 August, they swept the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore. Together with the light cruiser , Pelorus was one of the first British ships to re-enter Singapore harbour. She returned home in May 1946 and was paid off. In 1947 the ship was sold to the South African Navy, together with her sister ship, Rosamund, and departed England on 22 November after a refresher course at the minesweeping school at HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar, Scotland. The sisters arrived at Cape Town on 24 December, making stops at Gibraltar, Freetown and Walvis Bay en route. She was rechristened by the mayor of the city, A. E. Hirst, on 21 January 1948. The navy had originally intended to rename the ship Maritzburg, but decided to use the city's full name after protests. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the frigate , they visited ports in Portuguese Mozambique, returning to Durban on 12 December. While serving as a midshipmans' training ship, Pietermaritzburg became the largest South African warship to visit Knysna in September 1953.

The guacharaca itself consists of a tube with ridges carved into its outer surface with part of its interior hollowed out, giving it the appearance of a tiny, notched canoe. It is played with a fork composed of hard wire fixed into a wooden handle. The guacharaquero (guacharaca player) scrapes the fork along the instrument's surface to create its characteristic scratching sound. A typical guacharaca is about as thick as a broomstick and as long as a violin. The guacharaca was invented by native American Indians from the Tairona culture in the region of la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia as an instrument to simulate the guacharaca (or Ortalis ruficauda) bird's singing. During the mid 20th century it was adopted by vallenato and cumbia musicians and today it is most often associated with these musical styles. Guacharacas provide a steady rhythmic backbone for all varieties of vallenato and cumbia.

Early career Nothing is known of his early life. The earliest known details of his life show that Humbert studied both Arts and then canon law at the University of Paris, where he was then admitted as a professor. A man of deep piety, subsequently, although he had thought about joining the Carthusians (whom his brother had joined), he entered the Dominican Order on 30 November 1224. After his profession, he was appointed lector of theology at the Dominican priory in Lyon during 1226 and, by 1237, he had become prior of that monastery. In 1240 he was appointed as the Prior Provincial of Tuscany. His presence in Italy led to support for his candidacy in the papal conclave of 1241 (although the Orsini and other noble Romans families seem to have opposed his election). Humbert returned to France in 1244 as Prior Provincial of the country, replacing Hugh of Saint-Cher, who had been made a cardinal, the first from their Order. During his time as Provincial in his native land, Humbert was charged with producing a lectionary for use by the whole Order.Simon Tugwell, Early Dominicans: Selected Writings, The Classics of Western Spirituality (Paulist Press, 1982), p. 32 Master General Humbert was elected as Master General of the Dominican Order in 1254. His first achievement was the re-organization (and consequent standardization) of the Order's liturgy. A new edition of the Order's Constitutions was prepared, and measures were taken to improve discipline in the Order's houses. Further, he issued new Constitutions for all nuns associated with the Dominican Order, based on those he himself had drawn up while serving as Provincial of France. He instituted the formal collection of information of two of the Order's members, Dominic, the founder, and the martyred Peter of Verona, with the intention of seeking their canonization. As a result of this search for information, Friar Gerald de Frachet produced his Vitae fratrum (Lives of the Brothers). Humbert was a great lover of languages, and encouraged linguistic studies among the Dominicans, primarily Arabic, because of the missionary work friars were pursuing amongst those led astray or forced to convert by Muslims in the Middle East. In 1255, he was called to adjudicate a dispute on the Constitutions of the Carthusian monks. In 1256, he became the godfather of one of the children of the holy King Louis IX of France; and, in 1258, the same king asked for his advice regarding the settlement of a dispute between various noble families. Humbert further encouraged the missionary activities of the friars, and schools to teach Oriental languages were established in Spain. In governing, he demonstrated both indulgence and severity when either was required, and he combined a broad outlook with a genius for detail. Under his rule, the Order flourished in Italy, Germany, Spain, France, and England. Humbert sent missionaries to the Greeks, Hungarians, Saracens, Armenians, Syrians, Ethiopians, and Tartars. He regulated the liturgy of the Divine Office, determined the suffrages of for the dead, commanded the history of the Order be recorded, and even issued minute decrees concerning the election of superiors, the reading of the Constitutions at meals, the transfer of friars from one house to another and other pertinent regulations.Editor's Preface to Humbert's Book on Preaching Opposition to the presence of both Dominicans and Franciscans at the University of Paris during the mid-1250s led to his issuing a joint encyclical with the Franciscan Minister General, urging that the two Orders - often in bitter dispute - should work together for their survival and the maintenance of their university chairs. Humbert resigned his position as Master of the Order in 1263 at the General Chapter held in London, probably on account of his failing health.Simon Tugwell, Early Dominicans: Selected Writings, The Classics of Western Spirituality (Paulist Press, 1982), pp. 33-34 Writings His literary production was geared mainly to the demands of his Order. He composed a Letter on Regular Observance and a commentary on the Rule of Saint Augustine (the Rule which had been adopted by the Dominicans in 1220, though in a modified form); and a treatise On Preaching, which had some success as a collection of exempla, but few manuscripts survive with its initial suggestions regarding the formation of the preacher himself. Humbert also composed the Opus tripartitum, one of a number of texts by leading intellectuals commissioned by Gregory X to be presented at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274. This document defended church reform, promoted the philosophy of crusades, discussed the relationship of the Church to Arabs, analyzed the causes and effects of the Greek Schism, proposed ways to go about the re- establishment of Christian unity between the two wings of Christianity, and promoted the mission to the heathens.

Medullina's brother was Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus,Wiseman, \\"Calpurnius Siculus and the Claudian Civil War\\". who had been adopted by Lucius Arruntius the Younger.Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy, p. 460. He was consul in AD 32, as the colleague of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. Medullina was betrothed to Claudius some time after his first engagement, to his relative Aemilia Lepida, was broken by Augustus in AD 8,Levick, Tiberius the Politician, p. 38. due to the disgrace of Aemilia's parents.Kershaw, A Brief History of the Roman Empire, p. 85. Tiberius probably pushed for the new betrothal, in order to reward his friend with a connection to the imperial family. The betrothal of Medullina and Claudius is attested by an inscription erected by Camilla's pedagogue, dedicated to \\"Medullina Camilli f. Ti. Claudi Neronis Germanici sponsa\\" (Medullina, daughter of Camillus, betrothed of Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus). In The Twelve Caesars, Suetonius states that Medullina unexpectedly fell ill, and died on the day of her wedding to Claudius,Mudd, I, Livia, p. 338. possibly in AD 9 or 10.Vagi, \\"Tiberius Claudius Drusus\\". Medullina's brother Scribonianus was the instigator of the first major rebellion against Claudius, while he was governor of Dalmatia in AD 42. Cultural depictions In Robert Graves' novel I, Claudius, Medullina Camilla is depicted as an early love of Claudius, who is able to look past his infirmities. Against Livia Drusilla's wishes, Claudius is permitted to marry Medullina by Germanicus and Augustus, but is robbed of happiness on the day of their engagement as she is assassinated for an unrelated vendetta against Medullina's uncle.

Comparing the OPP with his earlier Comilla project, Akhtar Hameed Khan commented: :\\"The Orangi Pilot Project was very different from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisers, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.\\".Introduction about Late Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan at Government of Pakistan website However, both projects followed the same research and extension methods.  Orangi Pilot Project ‚Äì Orangi Charitable Trust (OPP ‚Äì OCT) \\"OPP-OCT discovered that this growing settlement of Orangi was full of the enterprising spirit. The most impressive demonstration of the spirit of enterprises is the creation of employment everywhere in the lanes; inside the homes there are around twenty thousand family units, shops workshops, peddlers and vendors. In response to the dual challenge of inflation and recession, the residents have invented working family, modifying homes into workshops, promoting the women from mere dependents to economic partners and wage earners, abandoning the dominant patriarchal pattern with surprising speed. OPP‚Äôs research revealed two significant factors; first, there was unlimited demand for products and services of these family units. Second, the family units were extremely competitive (on account of very low over heads and very cheap and docile labour). The working family units of Orangi were completely integrated with the main Karachi markets. In fact many units are supplying goods to famous firms, who just put their labels and make big profits. What is required is to support their initiatives. Research further revealed that the production and employment in urban as well as rural areas could easily be increased provided the credit is accessible, as there was no shortage of market demand or productive labour. But they would not get credit at reasonable rate, because banks were inaccessible to them. The lack of bank credit forced them to buy raw materials at exorbitant prices while they had to sell their products at depressed prices and forego expansion. On the basis of the research findings, Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) decided to arrange access to credit to these micro enterprises. For this Orangi Pilot Project ‚Äì Orangi Charitable Trust (OPP ‚Äì OCT) was established in 1989 as an independent and autonomous institution in Orangi, a low income settlement of over one million people. The main objective is to support people effort in their economic development by providing credit in urban and rural areas.\\"http://www.oppoct-microcredit.com  Publications  * Perween Rahman, 2004, Katchi Abadis of Karachi: A survey of 334 katchi abadis ‚Äì Existing situation, problems and solutions related to sewage disposal, water supply, health and education.

An Annubar primary element or Annubar averaging Pitot tube provides better accuracy than single point Pitot tubes. The Pitot tube measures the difference between the static pressure and the flowing pressure of the media in the pipe. The volumetric flow is calculated from that difference using Bernoulli's principle and taking into account the pipe inside diameter.Perry, Robert H., Don W. Green. \\"Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, Seventh Edition\\". pages 10-8 to 10-9. McGraw Hill. 1997 The biggest difference between an Annubar averaging Pitot tube and a Pitot tube is that an Annubar averaging Pitot tube takes multiple samples across a section of a pipe or duct. In this way, it averages the differential pressures encountered accounting for variations in flow across the section. A Pitot tube will give a similar reading if the tip is located at a point in the pipe cross section where the flowing velocity is close to the average velocity. The T-Shape cross section of the Rosemount Annubar primary element allows for increased signal strength and reduced signal noise compared to other averaging pitot tube shapes. Annubar is a registered trade name with Emerson Process Management / Rosemount.

He played college football at the University of Miami. Early years Bailey attended Miami Southridge High School, where he lettered in football and track & field. He accepted a scholarship from the University of Miami. As a junior, he started one game and recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. He started every game in his last year, while tallying 75 tackles, one interception and 11 passes defensed. Professional career=Los Angeles Rams Bailey was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the fourth round (107th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he started the season on the injured reserve list for the first 5 games with a broken bone in his right hand. The tip of his left ring finger was torn off while playing against the Detroit Lions and was placed on injure reserve for the remaining games. In his second season, he started 6 games at left cornerback, posting 3 interceptions. In 1993, he appeared in 9 games and tied for a team-high 2 interceptions, before suffering a season ending knee injury. On October 23, 1994, Bailey made the longest punt return in NFL history when he ran for a touchdown in a game against the New Orleans Saints. What makes this return stand out is that every single player on the field assumed the ball was going to bounce through the end zone after the punt. Bailey saw that the ball never bounced out of the end zone and was still in play. He scooped the ball up, and returned it for a touchdown before anyone on the Saints realized what had happened. He was waived before the start of the 1995 season. Washington Redskins On September 12, 1995, he signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins to take the place of the injured Muhammad Oliver. He played in 4 games before being released on October 16, to make room for wide receiver Olanda Truitt. Dallas Cowboys On October 19, 1995, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys. He played mainly as a special teams player, until being named the nickel back after Clayton Holmes was suspended under the NFL substance abuse policy. He was a part of the Super Bowl XXX winning team. Miami Dolphins On March 7, 1996, the Miami Dolphins signed him as a free agent. He was a backup cornerback that appeared in 14 games and was declared inactive for 2 contests. Detroit Lions (first stint) On April 25, 1997, he was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Lions. He registered 15 special teams tackles (fifth on the team). In 1998, he played as a dime back, making 24 defensive tackles and 11 special teams tackles. The next year, he started 11 games at left cornerback and had 65 tackles, 2 interceptions, 24 passes defensed, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. Baltimore Ravens For the 2000 season, he signed with the Baltimore Ravens. He was the team's nickel back, recording 27 tackles, 4 passes defensed, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and 7 special teams tackles. On March 12, 2001, he was released in a salary cap move. Detroit Lions (second stint) On May 17, 2001, he was signed by the Detroit Lions to be the team's dime back. He played in 9 games, before suffering a broken neck against the Green Bay Packers that ended his career. Personal life Bailey works in the sports marketing business as President of Rosenhaus Sports.

Recorded during the political crisis in Yugoslavia, the album was marked by the band's leader Goran Bregoviƒá's pacifist efforts: the album cover featured Edward Hicks' painting Noah's Ark on the cover, the song \\"Lijepa na≈°a\\" (\\"Our Beautiful\\") featured the national anthem of Croatia \\"Lijepa na≈°a domovino\\" (\\"Our Beautiful Homeland\\") combined with the Serbian World War I song \\"Tamo daleko\\" (\\"There, Far Away\\"), and the title track featured lyrics about a couple which wonders what are they going to do if war begins, and concludes that they are going to \\"stay at home and kiss\\". The album recording revealed the crisis within the band. The songs \\"Lijepa na≈°a\\" and \\"Evo, zakleƒáu se\\" were played by studio musician Nenad Stefanoviƒá \\"Japanac\\" on bass guitar and Bajaga i Instruktori member Vladimir \\"Vlajko\\" Goluboviƒá on drums, which was caused clashes between Bregoviƒá and Bijelo Dugme bassist Zoran Red≈æiƒá and drummer Ipe Ivandiƒá. The lyrics for the song \\"ƒêurƒëevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim\\" were, by Bregoviƒá's words, inspired by a verse from ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá's song \\"Priƒça o Vasi Ladaƒçkom\\" (\\"The Story of Vasa Ladaƒçki\\").

Other hits included \\"Evo zakleƒáu se\\", \\"Ako ima Boga\\", \\"≈†ta ima novo\\", \\"Nakon svih ovih godina\\", pop-influenced \\"Napile se ulice\\" and Dalmatian folk music-inspired \\"ƒÜirbiribela\\". \\"ƒêurƒëevdan\\" video ban After the album release, Radio-Television Belgrade (RTB) decided to finance and produce a video for the song \\"ƒêurƒëevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim\\". The original idea was for the video to feature iconography inspired by Serbian Army in World War I. The video shoot was organized in the village Koraƒáica in Central Serbia. The band came to the video shoot reportedly not knowing anything about the concept of the video about to be shot. The band members were to wear insignia-less military uniforms along with old weapons, but Islamoviƒá thought it too \\"pro-war\\", refusing to wear a military uniform. Eventually, the band and the video director reached an agreement: everyone, except Islamoviƒá, wore Serbian traditional costumes, with only several of the original props used. Still, after the video was recorded, the Radio-Television Belgrade executives themselves decided not to broadcast it, fearing it might remind of the Chetnik movement. Post release At the beginning of 1989, the band went on a tour which should have lasted until April 1. The concert in Belgrade, held in Belgrade Fair on February 4, was attended by about 13,000 people. The concert in Sarajevo's Zetra, held on February 11, was also very successful; it was attended by more than 20,000 people. However, on some concerts in Croatia, the audience booed and threw various objects on stage while the band performed their pro-Yugoslav songs. After the concert in Modriƒça, held on March 15, with four concerts left until the end of the tour, Islamoviƒá checked into a hospital with kidney pains. This event revealed the existing conflicts inside the band: Bregoviƒá claimed that Islamoviƒá had no problems during the tour, while the band's manager, Raka Mariƒá, stated that Bijelo Dugme would search for a new singer for the planned concerts in China and Soviet Union. Bregoviƒá himself went to Paris, leaving Bijelo Dugme's future status open for speculations. As Yugoslav Wars broke out in 1991, it became clear that Bijelo Dugme will not continue their activity. ƒÜirbiribela would be the band's last release (excluding compilation albums) before the band's 2005 reunion and the live album Turneja 2005: Sarajevo, Zagreb, Beograd.

Originally a Cistercian abbey, it was converted to a country house in the 16th century after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Part of the house was demolished in the 20th century, but the remains, standing in 150 acres of park and woodland, are open to the public as Rufford Country Park. Part of the park is a Local Nature Reserve. The house itself is constructed of rubble, brick, dressed stone and ashlar with ashlar dressings and plain tile roofs. It is Grade I listed and scheduled as an Ancient Monument. The Monastic Foundation The abbey itself was founded by Gilbert de Gant, on 12 July 1147, and populated with Cistercian monks from Rievaulx Abbey in Yorkshire. The English Pope, Adrian IV gave the blessing for the abbey in 1156, following which the abbey's lands expanded and the villagers of Cratley, Grimston, Rufford, and Inkersall were evicted. A new village of Wellow, just outside the estate housed some of the displaced people. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1534 gives the gross income of the abbey as ¬£254 6s. 8d. (), and the clear annual value as ¬£176 11s. 6d. (). Abbot Doncaster obtained a pension of ¬£25 a year, on the dissolution of the house in 1536 among the lesser monasteries, but it was voided on his speedy appointment to the rectory of Rotherham on 2 July 1536. After its dissolution, the abbey gained a reputation of being haunted by the spectre of a giant monk carrying a skull. ; Abbots of Rufford * Philip de Kyme, temp.

The estate was granted to George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury. It was partly demolished and converted to a country house between 1560 and 1590 by the 6th Earl. The estate was inherited in 1626 by Mary Talbot, sister of the 7th and 8th Earls from whom it passed to her husband, Sir George Savile, 2nd Baronet. He remodelled the house in 1685‚Äì95. Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet, George's successor, made Rufford Abbey the seat of the Savile family after he burnt down the Saviles' original home to prevent its being occupied by a Parliamentarian garrison during the Civil War, but was killed in action in 1644. It was next inhabited by his son, the Marquess of Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, who died in 1695. In 1679, he constructed a new north wing on the site of the abbey church, containing reception rooms and a long gallery. He also built the large stable block to the right of the house. The surviving service wing (currently used as offices) was also added by the Saviles in the 17th century. Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet died unmarried in 1784 and the estate passed to his nephew The Hon. Richard Lumley-Saunderson, later 6th Earl of Scarbrough. He was the younger son of the 4th Earl of Scarbrough and Barbara Savile, the 8th Baronet's sister and heiress. On his death the estate passed to his younger brother, the 7th Earl, and then to the latter's son the 8th Earl, who bequeathed the estate in turn to his second natural son Captain Henry Lumley-Savile. When Henry died in 1881 it passed to his younger brother Augustus William Lumley-Savile (1829‚Äì1887) and then to his eldest (but illegitimate) brother, the diplomat John Lumley-Savile, who assumed the surname of Savile only and was created Baron Savile the following year. By the early 1900s, the Rufford Abbey Estate comprised some , but had begun to feel the effects of rising running costs and reduced incomes. In 1931 the estate descended to the 3rd Baron Savile, who was only 12 years old, and the trustees took the decision to sell the estate off in lots in 1938. Sir Albert Ball bought much of the land, and quickly sold the house to the eccentric aristocrat Harry Clifton. The abbey and 150 acres of grounds were bought by Nottinghamshire County Council in 1952. In 1956 the late 17th century north and east wings were demolished and the remaining west range and south service wing put into the care of the Ministry of Works. The site was opened to the public by Nottinghamshire County Council and is today one of the most visited attractions in North Nottinghamshire. Shops, catering, cars parks and events there are managed on behalf of the council by Parkwood Leisure.  History of The Lordship and Liberty of Rufford  The Manor of Rufford was listed in the Domesday Book. The Rufford Estate covered approximately twenty- nine square miles and, in addition to the ancient Liberty of Rufford, it included the parishes of Bilsthorpe, Eakring and most of Ollerton, Ompton, Boughton, Wellow, and extended into Blidworth, Edwinstowe, Egmanton, Farnsfield, Kirton, Tuxford, and Walesby. The titles of Lord of the Manor of Rufford and of the Liberty of Rufford were sold at auction by the Manorial Society of Great Britain in July 2010.  Ice houses  Rufford Abbey Ice House 1 Between 1729 and c.1845 many improvements were made to the Rufford estate. For example, the addition of the bath house, the creation of the lake and mill buildings, the construction of the brewhouse, water tower and coach house, and also the addition of five ice houses. Although Rufford Abbey once boasted five ice houses, only two remain today. All were constructed around 1820, when the estate was owned by John Lumley-Savile, 8th Earl of Scarbrough (1788‚Äì1856). The five ice houses are located near Rufford lake, created c. 1750; for the simple reason that the movement of ice from its source was easier. Not all of Rufford's ice houses faced north, as accessibility and the logistics of the ice may have meant that the builders found it easier to place the doorways facing the lake rather than northerly. It is believed that ice was mainly taken from Blackwalk Pond, which was drained to make way for housing in the 20th century. Blackwalk Pond was used to serve the abbey in Rufford's monastic era, and later supplied water to Rufford's water tower and brewhouse, which remain on site today. The 1851 poaching incident and ballad In 1851, a gang of forty or so poachers assembled in Rufford Park as a mass action against what was perceived to be the unfair monopolising of game-hunting rights by wealthy landowners. The poachers were attacked by ten gamekeepers and, in the ensuing battle, one of the gamekeepers was badly injured and later died of a fractured skull. Four of the poachers' ringleaders were arrested and each subsequently sentenced to deportation and fourteen years of penal servitude for manslaughter. The incident gave rise to the popular ballad, Rufford Park Poachers (Roud #1759), which depicts the poachers as bold heroes. One of, if not the, earliest recordings is a 1907 performance by Joseph Taylor, collected on wax cylinder by the musicologist Percy Grainger in 1907. It was digitised by the British Library and made available online in 2018. Grainger transcribed \\"Rufford Park Poachers\\" in the third movement of his suite, Lincolnshire Posy. \\"Rufford Abbey\\" is a popular piece composed and arranged for brass band by Drake Rimmer. It is often used as an intermediate grade competition piece, and is a popular choice for recitals. Martin Carthy recorded the song on his 1982 album Out of the Cut.  TV series  The abbey was the setting for Helen Cresswell's children's book (1984) and later TV series called The Secret World of Polly Flint (1987). The small neighbouring village of Wellow was also used.

Among Cuban poets of the first half of the 20th century he was the most outstanding of those who wrote poetry for poetry's sake, as opposed to poetry that addressed social issues or poetry that was inspired by the culture of Cubans of African descent.

MARIANO BRULL (1891-1956) upon graduation from the University of Havana in 1913 Biography Brull was born in Camag√ºey, in eastern Cuba, where his father, Miguel Brull, a Spanish army officer, was stationed. His mother, Celia Caballero, was descended from a family that had resided in Cuba for many generations. Early life As a child he lived in Ceuta and M√°laga in Spain. It was during his teenage years, as a student in Camag√ºey, that he discovered his passion for poetry. He and other students founded a short-lived magazine for which they wrote poems and essays.Parker, William B. ed. (1919). Cubans of Today of the Hispanic Society of America. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. p.109. Eagerly reading all the poetry he could, young Brull was especially struck by the work of the French Symbolist poets. In 1908 he moved to Havana where he attended the university, graduating with a Doctor of Law degree at age 22. He worked in a law office but also wrote poetry for the magazine El F√≠garo. During 1914 and 1915 he was a member of the small group that formed around the Dominican literary critic, Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a.Brull, Mariano (2001). Obras (Poes√≠a y Prosa: 1916-1955). ed. Emilio de Armas. Boulder, Co.: Society of Spanish and Spanish-American Studies. p.li. . Henr√≠quez, believing Brull had a future as a poet, became his mentor, introducing him to editors and suggesting he read poets whom Brull was not familiar with. In 1916 Brull published his first book of poetry, La casa del silencio. Shortly afterwards he married Adela Baralt and, switching careers, entered the Cuban diplomatic service. Brull was determined to leave Cuba where, exhausted by years fighting for independence and preoccupied by problems facing any new country, the arts were confused and anemic, uninterested in the great experiments (Cubism, futurism, etc.) taking place in Europe.\\"Poes√≠a\\", \\"Vanguardismo\\". Diccionario de la Literatura Cubana. Cervantesvirtual. Retrieved 2007. Diplomatic life Though impatient to reach Europe, the first two countries he was sent to as a diplomat were the United States and Peru. In the mid 20s he was stationed in Madrid. There he had the good fortune to participate in the reunions of the literary caf√©s frequented by many of the best poets Spain was to produce in the 20th century: Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Guill√©n, Vicente Aleixandre, and many others.Brull, Mariano (2000). Poes√≠a reunida. ed. Klaus M√ºller-Bergh. Madrid: Ediciones C√°tedra. p.46. . While in Madrid, some of Brull's early poetry was published in Paris in a French translation. In 1923 Brull joined about 60 young professionals of Havana who decided to take a public stance against the reigning passivity and mediocrity in politics and culture. Called El Grupo Minorista (the Minority Group),Brull. Obras. p. li. they demanded an end to years of cultural backwardness and an aggressive affirmation of the new artistic tendencies coming out of Europe. In politics, they denounced dictatorships and called for the formation of a Cuban government more responsive to the people.\\"El Grupo Minorista\\". Cubaliteraria . Retrieved 2007. In 1928 he published his second book of poetry, Poemas en menguante. Though also published in Paris, where he was now living, it was written in Spanish. All of his books were small editions for friends and family, paid for out of his pocket. The Brulls lived in Paris from 1927 to 1934 with only two interruptions: a year, each, in Berne and Havana. The return of the Brulls to Havana coincided with numerous riots and demonstrations as students clashed with the police of the government of President Gerardo Machado, an increasingly ruthless dictator. Brull spent the Great Depression back in Paris. Two or three times a year found him traveling. He frequently visited Havana, on business; southern Spain, the land of his childhood; and Mexico City where he called on his friends Gabriela Mistral, the Chilean poet, Alfonso Reyes, the Mexican man-of-letters, and others.Heliodoro Valle, Rafael (1947). \\"Di√°logo con Mariano Brull.\\" Revista de la Universidad de M√©xico. Ciudad de M√©xico: Universidad de M√©xico. vol II. p.24. In 1934 his third book of poetry, Canto redondo, was brought out in Paris. He was stationed in Rome between 1934 and 1937 where fascism was alive and thriving. After moving to Brussels (for the second time) at the end of the 1930s, Brull was in charge of attending to the many German Jews who, seeking visas to emigrate, had lined up before the legations and embassies of numerous countries. During these years he was Cuba's delegate to the XVII Reunion of the Assembly of the League of Nations and, also, Commissioner for the repatriation of Cubans fleeing the Spanish Civil War.Garc√≠a Morales, Alfonso (1984). \\"La Obra de Mariano Brull\\". (Master's Thesis. Sevilla: Universidad de Sevilla). p.126. Brull had decided that an all-European war was imminent‚Äîthough most of his colleagues and friends disagreed‚Äîand pressured the Ministry to be sent back to Havana. He left in June, 1939. The ship carrying all of the Brull's household effects to Cuba, a year later, was torpedoed by the Germans and sank. In 1939, a bilingual (French-Spanish) book, Po√´mes, came out in Paris, with a preface written by one of the greatest literary figures of France at the time, Paul Val√©ry. Brull worked for many years on a translation into Spanish of Val√©ry's most famous, and difficult, poems: \\"Le Cimeti√©re Marin\\" (The Graveyard by the Sea) and \\"La Jeune Parque\\" (The Young Fate).Allain-Castrillo, Monique (1995). Paul Val√©ry y el mundo hispanico. Madrid: Ediciones Gredos. p.232. . In Cuba, Brull was one of the principal organizers of a conference of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, held in 1941.Heliodoro Valle, Rafael (1948). \\"Diplom√°ticos Cubanos en el Extranjero\\". Diplom√°cia. La Habana, num. 23. p.39. This organization was made up of major intellectuals who believed that the interchange of ideas would help lead to a solution to the tension of the 1930s and the violence of the Second World War. Brull admired people who were capable of both action and thought. He had no use for the static attitude of Rodin¬¥s famous statue, \\"The Thinker\\".Brull, Mariano (1951). \\"Frente y Perfil del Coronel Cosme de la Torriente y Peraza, El Libertador Infatigable\\". Quoted in Brull, Obras. pp.232-233. Brull's hero was the Cuban journalist and poet, Jos√© Mart√≠, who was responsible for organizing the Cuban resistance to Spain and died in a skirmish with Spanish soldiers during the War of Independence.Heliodoro. Revista. p.27. His fifth book of poetry, Solo de rosa, appeared. His poems also were printed in the foremost literary publications: Social, Gaceta del Caribe, Espuela de Plata, Clavile√±o, Or√≠genes and El F√≠garo.\\"Biograf√≠a\\". www.cubaliteraria.com. Retrieved in 2008. He had long conversations with the exiled Spanish poet, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, who wrote a similar type of poetry. During the Second World War, Brull was stationed in Washington, D.C., and in 1945 was sent to Ottawa to establish the first Cuban diplomatic mission in Canada. In Brussels, once more, in 1950, he published Temps en peine. Tiempo en pena, a bilingual edition. Here, too, his wife died after many years of fighting cancer. His last post was as Cuban ambassador to Uruguay. However, he refused to comply with an order from the Cuban dictator, Fulgencio Batista, and he resigned abruptly, ending a career of 47 years in the Cuban diplomatic service.Brull. Poes√≠a. ed. M√ºller-Bergh. p.69. That same year (1954) the final book of poems he would publish, Rien que... (Nada m√°s que...), came out in Paris. Final years Back in Havana, he turned to modernizing the cattle ranch he had inherited from his mother. But a growing brain tumor weakened him bit by bit and eventually left him in a coma. He died at the age of 65 in 1956. Literary characteristics=Beginnings Brull's first book, La casa del silencio, is a good example of Hispanic modernismo, though it has its share of intimate, Symbolist influence and a touch of tropical romanticism. Already one finds themes that would stay with him always: the ideal of beauty and the exploration of the interior world of one's heart as an escape from the ungrateful reality of the world, of time and of history.Brull. Poes√≠a. ed. M√ºller-Bergh. pp.28,32. Evident is the influence of the Spaniard, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, and the Mexican, Enrique Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez.Garc√≠a Morales. p.29. But these poems are the works of an apprentice.Garc√≠a Morales. pp.49,89. Nine years pass between the publication of his first and second collections of poetry, years in which he matured, especially after he arrived in Europe.Garc√≠a Morales. pp.89,107. In his second book, Poemas en menguante, Brull embraces Symbolism (pure poetry) though the poems show him still struggling to assimilate the new style completely.Garc√≠a Morales. pp.41,172. He finds himself immersed in the heated discussion of the poets of his generation as to whether Symbolism, art as pure abstraction, meant the dehumanization of art. Brull made clear that poetry was the purification of thought and form, but never abstraction. Nevertheless, Symbolism and dehumanization were firmly linked in the minds of many. Harsh criticism of Symbolism was heard frequently, including in Cuba.Brull. Obras. ed. de Armas. pp. xxi, xx, xxii. Sound A cornerstone of Brull's poetry is the word as sound material.Brull. Obras. p. xxvii. This interest in sound can be found in the efforts of Mallarm√© and Val√©ry to achieve pure poetry but also in the neo-popular romances of the Spanish poetic tradition‚Äîa source that attracted other poets writing in Spanish, most famously Garc√≠a Lorca.Brull. Poes√≠a. ed. M√ºller-Bergh. p.56. Similar experiments involving playing with the sounds of words were to be found in Italian, German and English literature of the 1920s and before. Brull. Poes√≠a. p.58. Brull's creativity involving the use of sounds, through tongue-twisters and various phonetic experiments, could create a world of ‚Äúmagical enchantment.‚ÄùBrull. Poes√≠a. pp.56-57. These sounds and lexicological permutations combined, at times, to reach a level of senselessness which resulted in poetry that has come to be known as ‚Äújitanj√°fora‚Äù after the use of this word in Brull's poem ‚ÄúFiliflama‚Ä¶‚Äù, a poem entirely made up of invented words. :Filiflama alabe cundre :ala olal√∫nea al√≠fera :alveola jitanj√°fora :liris salumba sal√≠fera. :Olivia oleo olorife :alalai c√°nfora sandra :miling√≠tara gir√≥fora :zumbra ulalindre calandra. Yet such an extreme interest in sound was but one strand in Brull's poetry. The ‚Äújitanj√°fora‚Äù was ‚Äúa verbal joke, created by Brull at the margin of the main body of his work, but as an extreme consequence of this work‚Äôs development‚Äù.Brull. Obras. ed. de Armas. p. xxiii. Childhood Brull revealed an interest in childhood in a number of his poems through the subject matter or through the use of language and rhythms associated with children's verses or both. The verses he learned in southern Spain, as a boy, had a lasting impact on him.Brull. Obras. p. xxv. These verses were part of the traditional, popular poetry that was so appreciated by his generation of poets.Garc√≠a Morales. p.210. Typical features Though he used alliteration and metaphors abundantly, there are features of his work that differentiate it from the work of others. These include: * rare word associationsGarc√≠a Morales. p.179. * using a word twice in the same line but in totally different waysGarc√≠a Morales. p.180. * punning * combining or coupling words that mean the opposite or clash in their meanings (‚Äúthe melody of the perfume‚Äù), usually placed within dashes,Garc√≠a Morales. pp.258-59. and *illogical sound games and onomatopoeia where one sees the influence of futurism and Dadaism.Brull. Poes√≠a. ed. M√ºller-Bergh. p.53. Brull favored free verse, followed by blank verse, though he occasionally turned to the sonnet and other poetic forms.Garc√≠a Morales. p.314. His poems are usually short, and the total number of poems he wrote was rather limited, both rare attributes in comparison with most Hispanic poets.Brull. Poes√≠a. ed. M√ºller-Bergh. p.72. The rose The rose is the principal motif in Brull's poetry, his preferred symbol for ‚Äúa standard of perfection and permanence in a transitory world.‚ÄùBrull. Obras. ed. de Armas. p. xii. Mallarm√© had defined a flower as the absence of the stem and leaves, his way of stating that the finality of art is the concentration on the essence. No other Cuban poet went as far as Brull in immersing himself in this conception of poetry. But his Latin American origin do not allow him to forget the stems and leaves altogether. Brull's contribution to the poetry of Cuba is this counterpoint between the concrete and the ideal.Brull. Obras. p. xxx. An equilibrium between the sensual and the abstract is most fully reached in Solo de rosas, a collection of poems in which the poet praises the rose in its pure essence, fragile and wondrous, and not corrupted by the passage of time.Brull. Obras. p. xxxiii. Epitafio de la Rosa (Epitaph For a Rose) :Rompo una rosa y no te encuentro. :Al viento, as√≠, columnas deshojadas, :palacio de la rosa en ruinas. :Ahora‚Äîrosa imposible‚Äîempiezas: :por agujas de aire entretejida :al mar de la delicia intacta, :donde todas las rosas :--antes que rosa‚Äî :belleza son sin c√°rcel de belleza. : (I take apart a rose and I don't find you. :To the wind, thus, columns of floating petals, :the palace of the rose in ruins. :Now‚Äîimpossible rose‚Äîyou begin: :by needles of interwoven air :to the sea of the intact delight, :where all the roses of the world :--before they were a rose‚Äî :are beautiful without the prison of beauty.) Nothingness In his last works, Tiempo en pena and Nada m√°s que‚Ä¶, Brull's poetry takes on a melancholy, somber and reflective tone, that of a journey toward the black hole of existentialism, possibly intensified by personal tragedy (the death of his wife) and the world around him seemingly falling apart (the Spanish Civil War followed by the Second World War).Brull. Poes√≠a. ed. M√ºller-Bergh. pp.39, 66-67. and Garc√≠a Morales. p. 278. Throughout the years one can find, beneath the formal and expressive clarity, Brull's increasing concern of what he saw as a world in permanent deterioration.Brull. Obras. ed. de Armas. p. xiii. The roots of this desolation are evident in his first poems in which absence and silence‚Äîoften depicted as quietness‚Äîare present yet any discomfort is dispelled by the vision of ideal beauty. By the 1950s, absence is no longer a friendly notion as it veers into nothingness. Brull is consumed by a tragic vision of life in which all things, including beauty, are conceived of as subject to destruction or, a word he often chose, ruin. Once time has done its task, only nothingness remains.Garc√≠a Morales. pp.282, 290. ‚ÄúNever had Cuban poetry reached so far into desperation with such discreteness and solitude.‚ÄùBrull. Obras. ed. de Armas. p. xlvi.

JG 54 flew most of its missions on the Eastern Front where it claimed more than 9,600 aircraft shot down. It was the second-highest scoring wing in the Luftwaffe after JG 52 (+10,000 victories). Notable pilot aces (Experten) that flew with JG 54 included Walter Nowotny, Otto Kittel, Hans-Ekkehard Bob, Max-Hellmuth Ostermann, Hugo Broch and Hannes Trautloft. JG 54 participated in the Poland in 1939, and the Battle of Britain and invasion of the Balkans in 1940. The unit was transferred to the Eastern Front in the spring of 1941 in preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. It remained there for the rest of the Second World War. JG 54 first flew Bf 109Fs before changing to the more powerful Fw 190. Operational history I./JG 54 was initially formed as I./JG 70 in July 1939. On 15 September 1939, I./JG 70 was redesignated I./JG 54. The initial unit designation for II./JG 54 was I./JG 138. This unit was raised in 1938 after the Anschluss of Austria and included many Austrian nationals. I./JG 138 became II./JG 54 on 6 April 1940. III./JG 54 was initially raised as I./JG 21 and redesignated III./JG 54 on 15 July 1939, with official records reflecting the change only after a year. Thus, III./JG 54 fought in Poland and France as I./JG 21. Invasion of Poland and Battle of France JG 54 took part the invasion of Poland in September‚ÄìOctober 1939. Equipped with Bf 109s, their operations consisted of ground attack, air superiority and escorting Stukas. JG 54 was transferred back to Germany on 9 October 1939. Before the invasion of France, during a period known as Phoney War, it operated mainly in an air defence role. Germany invaded France on 10 May 1940. The Luftwaffe operated by advancing in front of the German army to destroy French airfields and bomb cities, industrial complexes and transportation hubs. JG 54's role was to escort the bombers (Stukas and Heinkel He 111s mostly) and to conduct fighter sweeps in French airspace in order to maintain air superiority. The unit also operated at Dunkirk against the evacuating British Expeditionary Force. During the period 10 May to 21 June (until the capitulation of France), JG 54 claimed 17 aircraft, according to JG 54 documentation. Before the Battle of Britain the wing was transferred to the Netherlands. In a British raid on the Soesterberg airfield, III/JG 54 suffered heavy ground crew and equipment losses. While in the Netherlands, the unit claimed another 21 aircraft. The Battle of Britain The Battle of Britain began in late July and early August, with the goal of destroying the RAF, a prerequisite of a land invasion of Britain. The three JG 54 squadrons were transferred to airfields near Calais. Fighter availability, at the starts of JG 54's Channel Front operations peaked at between 60 and 80 machines.Scutts 1992, p. 35. The first major clash in the Battle came for JG 54 on 5 August 1940, when 1. and 3. Staffeln attacked six Spitfires of No. 64 Squadron over the Kent coast and shot down two, suffering a Bf 109 damaged.Scutts 1992, p. 36. Dissatisfied with the fighter arm's performance in the operation, G√∂ring's purge led to a command shakeup in mid-1940. Major Hannes Trautloft was placed in command of JG 54. The Battle of Britain proved costly for both the Luftwaffe and JG 54. The wing lost 43 pilots (40 percent of its strength at the onset of the operations): 18 killed in action and two in accidents, 13 missing in action and 10 made prisoners.Scutts 1992, p. 47. In return, JG 54 claimed 238 enemy aircraft destroyed. After the Luftwaffe's poor performance, the three squadrons were assigned to separate locations in Germany and France. On 29 March 1941 Stab, II, and III/JG 54 were relocated to the Balkans, for the war against Yugoslavia. With the Balkans campaign over, the Geschwaders tally of air victories had risen to 376. The unit was moved to Pomerania to re-equip with the Bf 109F Scutts 1992, p. 58. in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. The Eastern Front Bf 109G-2 of JG 54 on the Russian front, August 1942 JG 54 was assigned to Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 as part of the Luftwaffe's Luftflotte 1. From the first days of the conflict, the unit proved to be one of the most effective units of the entire eastern front. June 30 was one of its most successful days of the entire war: JG 54 claimed no less than 65 kills (mostly bombers without fighters escort) over the town of Daugavpils.Scutts 1992, p. 61. The \\"Gr√ºnherz\\" pushed on, still supporting Army Group North, towards the Gulf of Finland, fighting through Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.Scutts 1992, p. 61. JG 54's operations for 1941-43 had a twofold objective: to keep the pressure on the Leningrad sector, and to reduce Soviet pressure on the Lake Ilmen area at the German flank. The Geschwader remained on that part of the Eastern Front for most of its existence. In the period 22 June - 5 December 1941 the unit destroyed 1,078 Soviet aircraft in return for 46 losses in aerial combat and a single fighter on the ground.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 116. Such was the pace and scale of fighting that JG 54 celebrated its 1,000 kill on 1 August 1941, thanks to Lieutenant Max-Hellmuth Ostermann.Scutts 1992, p. 63. JG 54 received its first Focke-Wulf Fw 190s in February 1943. On the 19th of that month had claimed its 4,000th aerial victoriy.Scutts 1992, p. 95. On February 23, \\"Gr√ºnherz\\" obtained another of their greatest victories of the war, claiming 32 kills for no losses, in the Leningrad area.Bergstr√∂m 2019, p. 235. The following day I and III Gruppen claimed 43 more. By February 1943, JG 54 had flown 21,453 war sorties.Scutts 1992, p. 95. I Gruppe took part in the Battle of Kursk in July‚ÄìAugust 1943. Feldwebel Helmut Missner was credited with JG 54's 5,000th aerial victory on 17 July.Bob 2011, p. 250. But I Gruppe lost not less thann tre Kommandeuren in succession between 6 July and 4 August.Scutts 1992, p. 98. Moreover, still in July, Trautloft had left JG 54, when General Adolf Galland asked him to join is staff (he ended the war with 57 victories and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross). After his departure, JG 54 continued operating in the area of Army Group North, and their victory tally rose continuously. The 7,000th JG 54 claim was made on 23 March 1944, with the 8,000 mark passed on 15 August. Fw 190D-9 of 10./JG 54 Gr√ºnherz, pilot (Leutnant Theo Nibel), downed by a partridge which flew into the nose radiator near Brussels on 1 January 1945. I., II. and IV./ JG 54 ended the war fighting around the Baltic region, supporting the troops of Army Group North through Latvia and Estonia, and into the Courland Pocket. JG 54 could never hope to regain air superiority against the mounting number of Russian aircraft. The Russians never defeated Army Group North, which held out until the last day of the war, surrendering 210,000 Germans to the Soviets in Courland. All remaining serviceable Fw 190's of JG 54 were ordered to fly to Flensburg on the German-Danish border. 90 personnel from JG 54 were able to flee to the west by air. The German Navy evacuated as many as possible of the remaining ground personnel by ship. The Western Front In February 1943 III./JG 54 was transferred back to the west for operations against the RAF and USAAF. At first they operated as a stand-alone Bf 109G Gruppe, but later were attached to JG 26. Intensive training in the more rigorous techniques of fighting on the Western Front were only partly successful, and Oberst Josef Priller, Geschwaderkommodore of JG 26 and charged with III Gruppe's training, refused to declare the gruppe operational. III Gruppe transferred to North Germany as a result, supporting Jagdgeschwader 1. During the autumn of 1944, III./JG 54 was the first Luftwaffe unit to be supplied with the new Fw 190 D-9 \\"Dora\\". The D-9s were used in base defence missions for the Me 262 jets of Kommando Nowotny, and later over North-West Europe. 68 operational aircraft were available early in December, but due to heavy losses, the gruppe was disbanded soon after. Pilots Robert Wei√ü, the Gruppenkommandeur, and 12 other pilots were killed by RAF fighters on 29 December 1944 alone. At the end of 1944 ZG 76 was disbanded and its pilots formed the nucleus of a new III./JG 54. Operating from Berlin, the unit's Fw 190s saw intensive action against Soviet ground targets such as road and rail supply columns, flak positions, armour and the bridges across the River Oder. A few weeks before the war ended, the depleted III./JG 54 was disbanded, being absorbed into JG 26. Although Luftwaffe documentation were destroyed at the end of the war surviving records indicate JG 54 lost 491 pilots killed in action and 242 pilots missing. A further 322 pilots were wounded in action. The ground personnel lost 570 killed.Bob 2011, p. 311. Total losses in aircraft were approximately 1,071 Bf 109 and 746 Fw 190.

In his career, Druckenmiller played for the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins, and Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League, as well as the Memphis Maniax of the XFL and the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League. College career After attending high school at Northampton Area High School in Pennsylvania, Druckenmiller prepped at Fork Union Military Academy in Fork Union, Virginia, before committing to Virginia Tech. Druckenmiller started two years at quarterback for the Virginia Tech Hokies football team. As a senior, he won all-Big East accolades. Druckenmiller's Hokies won the Big East Conference championship in 1995 and 1996. In 1995, they defeated the Texas Longhorns in the Sugar Bowl. In December 1996, Druckenmiller graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in physical education. *1995: 151/294 for 2,103 yards with 14 touchdowns vs. 11 interceptions, ran for 57 yards *1996: 142/250 for 2,071 yards with 17 touchdowns vs. 5 interceptions, ran for 205 yards Professional career=National Football League Druckenmiller was drafted in the first round (26th overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, which intended to groom him as Steve Young's successor; after the draft, 49ers coach Steve Mariucci commented about Druckenmiller: \\"I would like to think he's our quarterback of the future.\\" Because Young had a concussion, Mariucci decided to start Druckenmiller for the week 2 game (September 7, 1997) against the St. Louis Rams. Although the 49ers won 15‚Äì12, Druckenmiller completed only 10 of his 28 attempted passes for 102 yards with one touchdown pass and three interceptions. In the fourth quarter, Druckenmiller was 0-for-5 with one interception and two near-interceptions. Druckenmiller played in three more games: first in week 3 backing up Steve Young in the 49ers' 33‚Äì7 win over the New Orleans Saints. In that game, Druckenmiller completed 4 of 6 pass attempts for 41 yards, was sacked once for 9 yards, and lost one yard on a rush attempt. The following week, the 49ers beat the Atlanta Falcons 34‚Äì7. Druckenmiller was 2-for-7 for 32 yards and a 6-yard sack, and -3 yards rushing. Druckenmiller's next game action was in the 49ers' final 1997 regular season game, a 38‚Äì9 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in which Druckenmiller was 5-for-11 for 64 yards, one interception, one sack, and one rushing yard. He finished the 1997 season 21-for-52 with one touchdown pass and four interceptions. In the 1998 season, Druckenmiller played only two games: week 2 against the Washington Redskins and week 6 against the New Orleans Saints. After the season, General Manager Bill Walsh belittled his football skills and implied that Druckenmiller would have been released but for salary-cap ramifications. On September 6, 1999, the 49ers traded Druckenmiller to the Miami Dolphins for a conditional draft choice. Druckenmiller did not play a down in 1999. In a preseason game on August 9, 2000, Druckenmiller completed 13 of 21 pass attempts in the Dolphins' 13‚Äì10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers for 141 yards including the 78-yard first touchdown drive. The Dolphins cut Druckenmiller on August 16. In 2008, ESPN named him the 11th-biggest bust since the AFL-NFL merger. Later career In 2001, he had limited action as a backup with the Arena Football League's Los Angeles Avengers. He also played for the Memphis Maniax of the XFL in 2001. The XFL used the angle of Druckenmiller's history and his unusually strong arm and passing range to promote Maniax games. He ranked 13th in the league in rushing yards (208, leading all quarterbacks) and fourth in passer rating, with 13 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He was one of only three of the league's eight Opening Day starting quarterbacks to survive the entire ten-week XFL season as starter without being injured or losing his starting position. In 2003, just as Druckenmiller was offered a job as a sales manager for a Little Rock, Arkansas-based cargo trailer company, the Indianapolis Colts offered Druckenmiller a tryout to be Peyton Manning's third-string backup, but the Colts ultimately signed Jim Kubiak. Legal troubles=Malicious wounding In 1996, Druckenmiller was charged with malicious wounding in connection with a bar brawl. One witness quoted Druckenmiller as saying to him, \\"Did you see me kick that guy's butt?\\" The judge held that the evidence against Druckenmiller was not sufficient to convict him and threw out the charge. Rape allegations On April 24, 1999, police in Blacksburg, Virginia, reported that Druckenmiller had been charged with rape, stemming from an incident in a house between 3 and 4 a.m. on March 4 of that year. According to Assistant Commonwealth Attorney Curtis \\"Skip\\" Schwab, Druckenmiller \\"went downstairs to have sex with a woman who had vomited twice and fallen on a couch,\\" and that Druckenmiller did not know the woman's correct first or last name. The accuser testified that she vaguely remembered a friend putting her to bed after a night of drinking. She passed out and awoke to find Druckenmiller on top of her. When asked what he was doing by a Montgomery County assistant commonwealth's attorney, the accuser responded, \\"Having sex. It took me a while to realize what was going on. I was disoriented. I had no idea where I was.\\" According to Druckenmiller, he had carried the woman to a bed after she vomited for the second time that night and slumped on a couch, and stated he went to check on her a few minutes later and asked how she was. When she told him she was drunk but doing fine, he asked her if she was going to make good on a promise she made to him earlier in the evening to have sex. On July 22, 1999, Druckenmiller was acquitted. http://onlineathens.com/stories/072399/spo_0723990034.shtml#.VhQDtSBViko After-football career Since 2004, Druckenmiller has lived in Memphis and worked in various sales, business management, and information technology positions with companies including ChoicePoint, LexisNexis, and A.S.

The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, and Niara Scarlett, and produced by Higgins and his production team Xenomania. Following Girls Aloud's formation on the ITV1 reality television show Popstars: The Rivals, \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was released just sixteen days later on 16 December 2002. Commercially, the song was an immediate success. It became the year's Christmas number one in the UK, spending four consecutive weeks atop of the charts in total. The song also reached number one in Ireland and peaked within the top forty in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The music video was recorded in an empty London warehouse days after Girls Aloud were formed. The song has been performed by Girls Aloud in a number of live appearances including Popstars: The Rivals and each of Girls Aloud's concert tours. Critically appreciated for its juxtaposition of surf guitar against electronic beats, \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was praised for its quality for both a girl group and a reality television act. The song was referred to as a defining moment of the decade musically, credited with reshaping British pop for the 2000s. Background and composition \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was written by Brian Higgins, Niara Scarlett and Miranda Cooper. In an interview with The Daily Telegraphs Alice Vincent, Cooper explained that she was into drum and bass at the time and had been inspired by Puretone's 1998 single \\"Addicted to Bass\\". The song has been described as \\"a mechanistic sashay of twangy surf guitar and sultry gang vocals ‚Äî Girls Aloud explodes like a five-headed Kylie Minogue.\\" The song is written in E minor (recorded in E-flat minor) with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 163 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from G3 to C#5. Following typical verse-chorus form, the song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. The bridge is also employed as a middle 8. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was one of sixty songs that Higgins and Cooper had written with the aim of launching their own girl group. The song was originally recorded in 2001 by Orchid, a London girl group that included singer and actress Louise Griffiths and who disbanded before gaining a firm record deal. Irish artist Samantha Mumba was due to record this as her comeback song in 2002 but she opted for \\"I'm Right Here\\" instead. It was chosen by Girls Aloud's manager Louis Walsh as their debut single. The six finalists of the ITV1 programme Popstars: The Rivals rehearsed the song a week before the finals. Release Girls Aloud were formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002. The concept of the programme was to produce a boyband and a girlband who would be \\"rivals\\" and compete for the Christmas number one single in 2002. Girls Aloud competed against One True Voice, managed by music producer Pete Waterman. Both groups were sent on huge promotional tour. They used a combative \\"Buy girls, bye boys\\" slogan to persuade the public to buy their single. A cover of One True Voice's single \\"Sacred Trust\\" appears on the special edition bonus disc of Girls Aloud's greatest hits album The Sound of Girls Aloud, alongside an extended performance version of \\"Sound of the Underground\\" which includes an instrumental breakdown. The single was released on two different CD single formats and on cassette. The first CD included a cover of East 17's \\"Stay Another Day\\" and Brian Higgins' remix of \\"Sound of the Underground\\", while the second CD included the instrumental of \\"Stay Another Day\\" and an interview with the girls. In some countries, a Flip & Fill remix of the single was featured. Controversy Pete Waterman caused a media frenzy after accusing Girls Aloud of being unoriginal and not singing on \\"Sound of the Underground\\" (after they claimed it was better to release a new song than a cover as the A-side). Many articles falsely claim that this track was then \\"stolen\\" from Orchid by Girls Aloud. The track was actually owned by Xenomania (the producers) and the original version was used as a \\"session singers\\" version, making it Girls Aloud's and not a cover as some articles suggested. Due to the press attention, the members of Orchid are credited on the single release and remain backing singers on the single. Sarah Harding explained that this just pads out the track and is not uncommon in the industry. Reception=Critical response \\"Sound of the Underground\\" received a positive response from most music critics. It \\"proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture.\\" A review for Girls Aloud's debut album stated that the song has \\"become a pulsating pop classic with a modern, metallic beat, catchy chorus and just the right amount of sleaze.\\" The song was further described as \\"an enticing blend of spiky guitars and Fatboy Slim beats topped off with an irresistibly catchy chorus.\\" Michael Osborn said that \\"Sound of the Underground\\" offers \\"a fresh tune that has no intentions of following the road to seasonal schmaltzville.\\" An article from The Guardian called the song \\"an icy confection very different from the normal run of girl-band things.\\" \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and another Xenomania production, Sugababes' \\"Round Round\\", have been called \\"two huge groundbreaking hits\\", credited with reshaping British pop music for the 2000s. Peter Robinson wrote, \\"Instead of what would become the predictable 'victory lap' ballad, here was an upbeat attitude-soaked celebration of life, partying, and being young.\\" In 2003, \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was voted Best Single at the Disney Channel Kids Awards. The Telegraph placed the song at number 15 on a list of 100 songs that defined the 2000s, while NME included it at number 39. Spinner.com named \\"Sound of the Underground\\" the eighth best British song of the 2000s. Chart performance \\"Sound of the Underground\\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 22 December 2002. Girls Aloud sold just over 213,000 copies, while One True Voice's \\"Sacred Trust\\" sold only 147,000. Girls Aloud stayed at number one for a second and third week, the final chart of 2002 and the first chart of 2003. The single spent another week at number one, bringing \\"Sound of the Underground\\" to a total of four consecutive weeks at number one in the UK. It spent two weeks in the top five at numbers three and five respectively, before slipping to number nine. The single spent fourteen further weeks inside the UK's top 75. It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in March 2003 for shipments of over 600,000 and sold over 653,000 copies. In December 2015, the Official Charts Company stated that \\"Sound of the Underground\\" had a chart sales tally of 679,770. In August 2017, the Official Charts Company updated the single's total sales figures to approximately 715,000. The song had similar success on the Irish Singles Chart. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" debuted at number two behind Eminem's \\"Lose Yourself\\", while One True Voice only managed to chart at number nine. They held on at number two for a second and thirdweek. In the song's fourth week on the Irish chart, \\"Sound of the Underground\\" managed to rise to number one, finally dethroning Eminem. It spent two weeks at the pole position. The song peaked inside the top twenty on Belgium's Ultratop Flanders chart and the Netherlands' Single Top 100 chart. The song also charted in Australia and various European countries. Music video The video for \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was shot in an empty London warehouse on 14 December 2002, just days after Girls Aloud's formation in the last week of competition of Popstars: The Rivals. It was directed by Phil Griffin, who would later direct the videos for \\"No Good Advice\\" and \\"Life Got Cold\\". It features the band members in various scenes \\"underground\\". In the group scene, they perform the song backed by a band in a large metal enclosure. As the song progresses, each band member also incorporates a tall microphone stand into the choreography, echoed in many live performances in the song. In the solo scenes, each member is shown sitting or standing in the \\"underground\\" setting while various other shots, such as a light bulb spontaneously cracking open and catching on fire, are shown. The music video is available on the \\"No Good Advice\\" DVD single, Girls on Film, Style and 2012's Ten: The Videos. Live performances Girls Aloud performed \\"Sound of the Underground\\" live for the first time on Popstars: The Rivals on 7 December 2002, wearing coordinating pink-and-black outfits as seen on the single's music video. Small puffs of smoke were sent up into the air each time the song reached its chorus. In order to promote the single, the group performed the single at various locations across the country, including a signing at an HMV store in Manchester's Trafford Centre. They also made many television appearances, performing on programmes such as CD:UK, GMTV, Popworld, RI:SE, Richard and Judy, Smile, This Morning, Top of the Pops Saturday, and UK Top 40: CBBC Viewers' Vote. They performed on Popstars again on 22 December, just moments after finding out their single was the Christmas number one. Wearing all-white outfits, the performance included lights and smoke as well as adlibs referencing the number one. They also sang \\"Sound of the Underground\\" on the Top of the Pops Christmas special, which airs annually on Christmas Day. The song was performed on shows like Tops of the Pop and The Saturday Show during 2003. It was also performed at a number of live events in 2003, such as Ireland's ChildLine Concert, Spring Break, Pepsi Silver Clef, Party in the Park, Live & Loud, and the West Belfast Festival. Girls Aloud began to promote the song's release across continental Europe, which involved appearances at Belgium's TMF Awards and on Germany's VIVA Interaktiv and the German version of Top of the Pops. In the United Kingdom, Girls Aloud performed \\"Sound of the Underground\\" at the 2003 Disney Channel Kids Awards (where it was named Best Single), the Children in Need telethon, and once again at 2003's Top of the Pops Christmas special. Girls Aloud returned to Ireland's ChildLine in 2004. It was also performed for the group's MTV special, as seen on their DVD Girls on Film. Since its release, \\"Sound of the Underground\\" has been included on each of Girls Aloud's tours. The track was included as the encore to their 2005 tour What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour. The performance included a dance break and ended with an explosion of pyrotechnics. For 2006's Chemistry Tour, the song was accompanied by new choreography involving chairs, while 2007's The Greatest Hits Tour saw the group in black-and-white variations on a suit. The song was slightly remixed for 2008's Tangled Up Tour, during which Girls Aloud performed it in the first section alongside male dancers. \\"Sound of the Underground\\" was also included on 2009's Out of Control Tour; flames burst out of the stage as the group sang and danced. The song was again included on the band's 2013 reunion tour, Ten: The Hits Tour. It was performed as the opening song as the band came down onto the stage on a huge sign reading the band's name. The single has also been performed at Girls Aloud's appearances at V Festival in 2006 and 2008, as well as their two nights supporting Coldplay at Wembley Stadium. It was showcased during Girls Aloud's 2007 appearance on The Album Chart Show, where they performed songs from their greatest hits album. They also performed it on their one-off variety show The Girls Aloud Party. The group was accompanied by Kaiser Chiefs, who led into \\"Sound of the Underground\\" with their own track \\"Never Miss a Beat\\".

Brooks stated that she, as stated by Canadian Woman Studies, \\"wrote the book for those people who like her, before she visited Islamic countries, would look at a woman in a chador and burst into outrage or piety.

Polygamy, the veil, and the seclusion of women come not from the Koran but local customs that the prophet's early followers eagerly embraced as part of the Islamic tradition.\\" Brooks had taken a six-year residence and traveled to Egypt, Eritrea, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Iran, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Contents The book includes chapters on Muhammad's practices with his wives and which compare and contrast the ideal in the Quran to the practiced reality. The Human Rights Quarterly wrote that \\"Brooks demonstrates that repressive policies toward women often are not based on accurate interpretations of religious texts.\\" Brooks argued that because women in Islam gained the right to divorce and get inheritance, they had actually obtained rights in early Islam.Lumetta, Geoff. \\"Nine Parts of Desire.\\" The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, ISSN 8755-4917, 04/1996, Volume XIV, Issue 8, p. 70. \\"One of the strongest female figures in the book is Faezeh Hashemi, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's 30-year-old daughter and the brains behind re-establishing women's sports in Iran. She led a campaign to reopen sporting facilities that were closed after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\\" and \\"The author points out that Islam's original message actually gave women sweeping rights that were unheard of at the time. These rights included the right to inheritance and the right to divorce.\\" and \\"She tells the story of a Sudanese woman in England who was murdered by her husband, also Sudanese, because he suspected her of adultery.\\" People chronicled in the book include women working for Hezbollah, a Saudi businesswoman, the United Arab Emirates's first female soldier, and a female American expatriate married to an Iranian man living in Iran. Faezeh Hashemi's efforts to restore female athletics in Iran are noted. Brooks also described the voting patterns of a female member of parliament in Iran. Brooks described two arranged marriages, one being a Kuwaiti couple who is happy, and the other being a Jordanian couple with a wife who is unhappy. She describes an honor killing of a Sudanese woman resident in the United Kingdom. At the end of the book she recalls seeing Indonesian Australian women wearing hijabs.*\\"Nine parts of desire: the hidden world of Islamic women // Review.\\" Resources for Feminist Research, ISSN 0707-8412, 04/1995, Volume 24, Issue 1/2, p. 35. \\"Back home in Australia, Brooks reacts spontaneously when seeing veiled women among a crowd of Indonesian - Australians, waiting to greet their relatives: \\"Oh, please. Not here too\\"(p. 236).\\" In Brooks's book she makes it clear that the status of women may differ significantly between different countries. Brooks herself stated that \\"the brightest hope for positive change might be found camouflaged among the black chadors of devout Iranian women\\". Iranian women as of 1994 had more rights compared to women from other Middle Eastern countries.Shapiro, Laura. \\"Under wraps in the Middle East -- Nine Parts of Desire by Geraldine Brooks.\\" Newsweek, ISSN 0028-9604, 02/1995, Volume 125, Issue 7, p. 81. Brooks wrote that \\"unquestioning adherence to religious rules gives them high ground from which to present their case for women's rights\\" but that \\"they have used that position sparingly.\\" Quandt wrote that the idea that the religious following gives them the authority is \\"a variation on the only-Nixon-could-go- to-China theme.\\" Shelley argued that Brooks's \\"somewhat rosy view\\" of Iranian women's lives is flawed because \\"the average Iranian girl will become neither an athlete nor a camerawoman covering the all-female Islamic games. Her life is much more likely to be circumscribed simply by the ideas and expectations of the man she marries.\\" Brooks argues that Islam's judgment should be \\"for the kind of life it offers the people in the lands where it predominates\\". Brooks advocates against female genital mutilation and honor killings, and Shelley stated that during this activism the author is \\"most effective\\". Patricia Lee Dorff of Foreign Affairs stated that based on the book, \\"liberal women are an endangered species\\". Canadian Woman Studies wrote that \\"the author provides a good account of the rise of fundamentalism in the Muslim world and how even western-educated women are willingly accepting and follow fundamentalist interpretations and practices of Islam.\\" The journal added that, according to the book, \\"women in Islamic countries are not just the passive recipients of government's ideologies, but much to the contrary are active agents in the processes of resisting, organizing, and fighting for social changes that positively improve women's status and situation.\\" Laura Shapiro of Newsweek stated \\"Brooks emphasizes that there is plenty in Islamic history to justify more independent roles for women. But with fundamentalism on the rise, progressive interpretations of scripture are dangerous to advocate.\\" Reception The author of the Canadian Woman Studies stated that the work is \\"very helpful for a Western audience\\" and that it \\"does not only give a more realistic picture of Middle Eastern women but it also shows the directions in which future studies should go\\" despite the criticisms the CWS author has. The CWS article argued that there is a lack of \\"a clearly identifiable theoretical approach\\" in Brooks's journalism and a \\"lack of an adequate historical analysis of Muslim societies\\". The publication also argues that \\"Brooks has difficulty in accepting the lack of interest in feminist issues showed by some of her acquaintances.\\" In regards to Brooks's argument that the Western powers are not showing action because the issue has to do with feminism even though the Western powers take action regarding race, the CWS article stated that Western countries have issues with both sexism and racism and that \\"to play off gender and race issues against one another is not only unhelpful but definitely harmful to the democratic and egalitarian struggle.\\" The publication Resources for Feminist Research is critical of the book. The publication argued that the work has \\"presuppositions, stereotypes, distortions and disingenuous paradoxes\\" because she presents the women in her book \\"as the wisdom of \\"Muslim\\" authorities\\" and does so \\"without qualification\\". It argues that the work exhibits a \\"sense of superiority and the appearance of Western Self in opposition to the Other\\" and a double standard where the author excuses an increase of Islamic fundamentalism in Muslim countries but shows a negative reaction when seeing the hijab worn by Indonesian Australian women in her home country. Geoff Lumetta of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs argued that the book should make comparisons between the situation of women in the West and those in Islamic countries in order to gain a \\"universal perspective\\". Citing women chronicled in the book who have a positive attitude to being Muslim, Lumetta added \\"However, readers already inundated with negative portrayals of Islam shouldn't shy away from this book, which is much more than a rebuke of the religion.\\" Ms. wrote that \\"Brooks's exploration of the precarious status of women in the wake of Islamic fundamentalism is riveting.\\" Bronwyn Drainie of The Globe and Mail argued that women \\"have access to and empathy with the half of the world's population whose lives are so often ignored by the Western press and media\\" so therefore Nine Parts of Desire \\"demonstrates the best possible reason for employing women as foreign correspondents.\\"Drainie, Bronwyn. \\"Nine parts of desire: the hidden world of Islamic women // Review.\\" The Globe and Mail (Index-only), ISSN 0319-0714, 01/1995, p.

The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystr√∏m Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through. Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. \\"No Good Advice\\" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia. The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. \\"No Good Advice\\" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as \\"a disco track with guitar\\", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production. Background and composition Musically, the song was labelled \\"a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles.\\" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro. Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, \\"No Good Advice\\" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need \\"no good advice\\" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for The Guardian in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase \\"I don't like fried rice\\". \\"No Good Advice\\" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, \\"pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand.\\" Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially did not like the song - \\"we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day.\\" Release It took Girls Aloud five months to release \\"No Good Advice\\". Nadine Coyle said in an interview with The Lipster, \\"We were No.1 for a month straight and then getting songs from all these other producers and we were, 'Nah, don't like it'. We waited from December to May before releasing a second single because we knew it had to be our strong point or we might as well kiss our careers goodbye.\\" Kimberley Walsh further exclaimed, \\"We knew it was strong enough to come back with.\\" Girls Aloud reportedly had to re-record \\"No Good Advice\\" because \\"it features rude words\\", such as \\"damn\\" and \\"shit\\". However, the line \\"Here I am / Dirty hands, I don't give a damn\\" was kept intact. An explicit version of the song appears on the special edition bonus disc of The Sound of Girls Aloud, replacing the lyric \\"shut your mouth because it might show\\" with \\"shut your mouth because your shit might show\\". Furthermore, an early demo of the song appears on a singles boxset released in 2009; this demo including the clean lyric in the first bridge and the explicit lyric in the second bridge. The song was released as a CD single, featuring an exclusive b-side entitled \\"On a Round\\", which was later covered by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai under the title \\"Run Run\\" for her 2009 compilation album Jeneration. The CD format also includes the Dreadzone Vocal Mix of \\"No Good Advice\\" and its music video. The DVD single did not actually feature the \\"No Good Advice\\" music video, just a photo gallery and behind-the-scenes footage. It did, however, include audio of the track and the video to \\"Sound of the Underground\\". Another remix, the Doublefunk Vocal Mix, was later featured on the \\"Life Got Cold\\" single and the remix album Mixed Up. Reception=Critical response \\"No Good Advice\\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. A BBC review described the song as \\"better than anything else [...] in the charts.\\" Unlike many other songs, it was said to be \\"not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together\\" that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. It was said to be \\"just as good, if not better\\" than \\"Sound of the Underground\\". It provides \\"more brassy and in-your-face lyrics of defiance and determination [...] Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits.\\" On a less positive side, Tourdates.co.uk said that \\"No Good Advice\\" was a failure at adding attitude to Girls Aloud's music and imitates \\"as many songs as possible.\\" The song has been compared to The Knack's \\"My Sharona\\". In 2003, the song won the Popjustice ¬£20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year. Popjustice founder Peter Robinson wrote that the song \\"established a motif that would saturate Girls Aloud's string of subsequent singles: an unpredictable and triumphantly contrary desire to push and pull the band in exciting new directions at every turn.\\" Chart performance \\"No Good Advice\\" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, held off by R. Kelly's \\"Ignition Remix\\". The song slipped to number five in its second week on the chart. The single lasted two more weeks in the top twenty at numbers eleven and seventeen respectively. Overall, \\"No Good Advice\\" was inside the top forty for six weeks; it spent an additional eight weeks in the top 75, selling over 105,000 copies. \\"No Good Advice\\" suffered a similar fate on the Irish Singles Chart, peaking at number two behind Ireland's Eurovision finalist Mickey Joe Harte. It spent three consecutive weeks at number three, behind Harte and R. Kelly. The song fell to number seven in its fourth week on the Irish chart. It spent four further weeks in the top twenty. The song also charted in the top fifty in Belgium and the Netherlands, placing at numbers 45 and 26 respectively. Music video The video for \\"No Good Advice\\" was filmed in April 2003 and was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and would also direct \\"Life Got Cold\\". It features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits (which are seen on the cover of the original release of their album Sound of the Underground). Girls Aloud fade in and out like holograms, centered around a rusty old car parked near a phone booth. They are joined by several men playing electric guitar, whom they flirt with while in various other poses. In a separate scene, while a black background with bright pinkish lights being emitted from behind, all five girls shake tambourines and dance. The last two scenes are intertwined with neon-coloured animated special effects the background, finally ending with an explosion scene. In a special programme shown exclusively on MTV to promote their second album What Will the Neighbours Say?, Girls Aloud confessed that they hated the \\"No Good Advice\\" video shoot. According to the group, both Cheryl and Sarah's trousers ripped and the make-up artist shouted at them. The group woke with bruised thighs the following day. The music video can be found on the group's 2005 DVD release Girls on Film. In the group's 2007 DVD Style, which also features the music video, Girls Aloud were horrified by the video upon watching it again. Regardless, viewers of FHM TV voted the video for \\"No Good Advice\\" as the fifth sexiest music video of all time in 2006. Live performances \\"No Good Advice\\" was performed live for the first time on CD:UK on 5 April 2003, a month ahead of the single's release. Girls Aloud sang in front of a checkered background in red outfits with black accents, as seen on the single's artwork. The group returned to the show three more times to perform \\"No Good Advice\\", including a performance using taxi cabs as a prop and another using phone booths. It was performed on Top of the Pops Saturday twice, as well as its parent show. Girls Aloud also visited Blue Peter and Popworld. It was also performed at a number of live events in 2003, such as Spring Break, Pepsi Silver Clef, Party in the Park, the West Belfast Festival, and a festival in Belgium. Girls Aloud also sang the song on Germany's VIVA Interaktiv. In the United Kingdom, Girls Aloud later performed at the Children in Need telethon and on Popworld's Christmas special. Girls Aloud performed \\"No Good Advice\\" on their first three concert tours. For their first tour, 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour, Girls Aloud performed the song in school uniforms. The rendition featured an introlude taken from part two of the Pink Floyd song \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". The following year, \\"No Good Advice\\" was featured as the second track on the Chemistry Tour. The group, who were created by mad scientists in the show's opening sequence, wore lab coats. The performance, influenced by Broadway, was set in a laboratory as each member was paired with a male dance partner. After a dance break, the mad scientist dancers performed a \\"magic trick\\" in which he made Cheryl Cole \\"disappear\\" and then reappear. For 2007's The Greatest Hits Tour, Girls Aloud performed \\"No Good Advice\\" in lingerie. The stage featured pedestals and platforms which Girls Aloud were on. For 2009's Out of Control Tour, \\"No Good Advice\\" was included in a greatest hits medley which closed the show. The song was also performed on the band's 2013 reunion tour, Ten: The Hits Tour. It was performed as the second song in the show after the opener \\"Sound of the Underground\\".

In 2008, Dave joined Lehman Brothers where he served as a Senior Vice President of Lehman's Private Fund Marketing Group. He left Lehman Brothers in 2008 to become the Co-Head of Greenhill's Private Capital Advisory Group. In 2015, he joined Moelis & Company to lead their new private equity fundraising business. College Brown had a successful career at Duke University. In his November 4, 1989, starting debut he threw for 444 yards against Wake Forest University, including a 97-yard touchdown to wide receiver Clarkston Hines to establish Duke's longest play from scrimmage.Duke Sports Information Office. , June 28, 2006.\\" Later that month, Brown set a school single-game record with 479 passing yards against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, upending Duke's rival, 41-0, to finish the year with seven straight wins and a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. The Blue Devils subsequently received a bid to play in the All-American Bowl, Duke's first bowl game in almost 30 years. In 1991, Brown was chosen as the recipient of Duke's Carmen Falcone Team MVP Award. Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football quarterbacks: pass attempts in a season (#4, 437), pass attempts in a career (#5, 845), pass attempts in a game (#8, 54), pass completions in a game (#5, 33), pass completions in a season (#5, 230), pass completions in a career (#5, 463), passing yards in a game (#1, 479), passing yards in a season (#5, 2,794), passing yards in a career (#5, 5,717), touchdown passes in a game (#2, 4), touchdown passes in a season (#3, 20), touchdown passes in a career (#4, 42), 300-yard passing games in a season (#2, 4), 400-yard passing games in a career (#3, 8), 400-yard passing games in a season (#1, 2), and 400-yard passing games in a career (#2, 2).Duke Sports Information Office. \\"Duke Football Media Guide\\", 2008.\\" Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football offensive players: total offensive yards in a season (#5, 2,851), total offensive yards in a career(#5, 5,770), total offensive yards in a game (#2, 470), and two-point attempts in a game (#1, 3). *1989: Threw for 1,479 yards with 14 TD vs 6 INT in just 8 games.

Would also run for 5 TD. NFL Brown was drafted by the Giants as the top overall selection in the 1992 Supplemental Draft. His first start came on December 12, 1992, when he was forced into the lineup due to injuries of Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler, and Kent Graham, dropping a 19‚Äì0 decision to the Phoenix Cardinals. To make matters worse, Brown himself was injured during the game and didn't play a down the rest of the season. Following Simms' retirement after the following season, Brown won the starting job in 1994 and helped guide his team to a 9‚Äì7 record, including a season-ending six-game winning streak. However, the Giants won only a combined 11 games in the next two seasons and their offense finished statistically worst in the league in 1996. This finish led to the firing of Dan Reeves, and the hiring of noted QB guru Jim Fassel. After injuring his chest during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Brown lost his starting job in 1997 and was never able to re-claim it. Jim Fassel went the rest of the season with Danny Kanell at quarterback and had an unexpected run to the playoffs and division title. In the off- season Brown was signed by the Arizona Cardinals to play primarily as a backup, and he ended up finishing his career in 2001 with Arizona. Following his career in professional football, Brown moved on to investment management.

The park, about north of the county seat of Media, offers many recreational activities, such as hiking, biking, fishing, and picnicking. Ridley Creek passes through the park. Highlights include a paved multi-use trail, a formal garden designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, which recreates daily life on a pre-Revolutionary farm. The park is adjacent to the John J. Tyler Arboretum. Ridley Creek State Park is just over from downtown, Philadelphia between Pennsylvania Route 352 and Pennsylvania Route 252 on Gradyville Road. History The bulk of the property was acquired in the late 1960s from the estate of well known horse breeder Walter M. Jeffords, Sr. and his wife Sarah, a niece of Samuel D. Riddle. The Jeffords had acquired the land starting about 1912 in small parcels, until they had over , which was the largest private undeveloped property in the Philadelphia area by the 1960s. By 1918 they had built a large mansion, now the park office, around a stone colonial farmhouse. Twenty-four other historic properties were located on the grounds, many farmsteads that had retained family ownership since the seventeenth century. In 1976 these properties were registered on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district. The area was originally settled by English Quakers and remained agrarian into the twentieth century. The oldest property is the 1683 Worrel House. In 1718 a water mill, then known as Providence Mill, began to grind corn. In the late 18th century a plaster mill was established next to the grist mill. A rolling and slitting mill replaced the plaster mill by 1812, and became known as Bishop's Mills. Workers cottages, a dam, and several outbuildings complete the mill complex, now known as Sycamore Mills. The mills operated until 1901, when they were damaged by fire. Note: This includes Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation in the park The Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation is a living museum on the farm where the Pratt family lived from 1720 to 1820.

The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Noel Gallagher of Oasis received a writing credit due to similarities with Oasis' \\"Wonderwall\\". Released as their third single in August 2003, \\"Life Got Cold\\" became Girls Aloud's third consecutive top three hit on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked at number two in Ireland and Scotland, and peaked at number 14 in Belgium. Set in an abandoned city, the music video suggests coldness and darkness with its blue hue. It portrays Girls Aloud moving in stunted movement. \\"Life Got Cold\\" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on three of Girls Aloud's concert tours. Described as a \\"surprisingly poignant\\", the melancholic ballad received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics; however, it was criticised for its similarities with Oasis. Background and composition \\"Life Got Cold\\" is a ballad written in D minor. The chord progressions vary throughout the song but the different chords include B, C, Dm, Gm, and Am. Following typical verse-chorus form, the song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. The verses are \\"talk-sung\\", while the bridge and chorus are song over guitar strumming. The middle 8 is a slower version of the bridge. The song tells the tale of young love that ended \\"when summer slipped away.\\" \\"Life Got Cold\\" was a late addition to Sound of the Underground, completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. Producer Brian Higgins did not take the idea of a Girls Aloud version of the song seriously until he heard the group sing it, because a track working \\"has always got to be based on an artist's performance, not the music itself. But they sang it, and they really nailed the melancholic aspect of it, and it sounded beautiful.\\" The lyrics focus on \\"the directionlessness of modern life.\\" The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of \\"Life Got Cold\\" and that of the 1995 Oasis hit \\"Wonderwall\\". A BBC review stated \\"part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into Wonderwall by Oasis.\\" A source told The Sun that Girls Aloud \\"are all big Oasis fans so I'm sure they won't mind comparisons with their classic love song.\\" Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. Girls Aloud later made a cameo appearance in Oasis' 2007 rockumentary Lord Don't Slow Me Down. Release \\"Life Got Cold\\" was not originally the choice for Girls Aloud's third single. Polydor Records had originally chosen \\"Some Kind of Miracle\\" to be released, but the plan was dropped after an overwhelming fan response to \\"Life Got Cold\\". The single was released on 18 August 2003 in the UK. It was available on two different CD single formats and as a cassette tape. The first CD featured a cover of the Duran Duran song \\"Girls on Film\\" as the b-side, which would later become the title for a Girls Aloud DVD, as well as a remix of \\"No Good Advice\\". The disc's enhanced section features the \\"Life Got Cold\\" music video and a photo gallery. The second disc included both the radio edit and album version of \\"Life Got Cold\\", as well as the 29 Palms Remix Edit and the Stella Browne Edit. It also came with a free fold-out poster. The cassette also featured an exclusive b-side, an original track entitled \\"Lights, Music, Camera, Action\\". The photos featured on the single's artwork were reshot at the last minute, following the group's request. Reception=Critical response \\"Life Got Cold\\" received positive reviews from music critics, although it did receive criticism due to the similarities with the song Wonderwall by Oasis. BBC called the song a \\"charming ballad\\" that was \\"a sweet but slightly sad pop song.\\" RT√â.ie thought \\"Life Got Cold\\" was \\"surprisingly poignant.\\" However, some noted that the chorus held many similarities to that of the Oasis song \\"Wonderwall\\". The songwriters dismissed claims of plagiarising Oasis. Allmusic referred to it as \\"a solid ballad, suggesting a less intellectual Dido.\\" Chart performance The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, behind Blu Cantrell's \\"Breathe\\" and Lemar's \\"Dance (With U)\\". It spent a second week in the top ten, slipping to number eight. The song spent a total of nine weeks in the top 75 overall, a far cry from the fourteen weeks \\"No Good Advice\\" or the twenty-one weeks that \\"Sound of the Underground\\" spent in the chart. \\"Life Got Cold\\" also debuted at number three on the Irish Singles Chart, but managed to rise to number two the following week. It spent two further weeks in the top ten, then two weeks in the top twenty. The single barely missed the top ten of the Netherlands Top 40, instead peaking at number eleven. It has since become the group's 16th best selling single domestically. Music video The music video for \\"Life Got Cold\\" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed the videos for \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and \\"No Good Advice\\". The band members are seen in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. Both group and individual shots are shown in various scenes. Nadine Coyle is seen in front of an abandoned building, while Sarah Harding is next to a car and a phone booth. Nicola Roberts is alone in a kitchen as pouring rain can be seen on the window. Cheryl Cole is shown in an alleyway, while Kimberley Walsh is alone on a street curb. The group are shown together on an abandoned bus, in an alley at night, and sat in front of the abandoned building. The video has a slightly blue hue to it, suggesting coldness and darkness. It also makes use of lens flares. The video can be found on two of Girls Aloud's official DVD releases, Girls on Film (2005) and Style (2007). Live performances \\"Life Got Cold\\" was first performed live by Girls Aloud at two summer festivals in 2003, Pop Beach and Live & Loud. The first televised performance occurred on CD:UK on 19 July 2003. The group performed in black-and-white business casual attire, as seen in the music video and on the single's artwork. They performed on CD:UK once more the following month, although Cheryl was absent due to illness. Girls Aloud also appeared on Diggin' It, Popworld, Top of the Pops and Top of the Pops Saturday (twice). Girls Aloud performed \\"Life Got Cold\\" on three of their concert tours.

A nose tackle who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (1993‚Äì99, 2001‚Äì03), Brown played 125 Packers games (103 starts) recording 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. Nicknamed \\"The Gravedigger,\\" in honor of his celebratory dance following a thunderous tackle, Brown played in 15 Packers playoff games. He was a major contributor on strong defenses during the mid-1990s. His best season was 1996, when Green Bay won Super Bowl XXXI. He was also part of the Kansas team that won the 1992 Aloha Bowl, and was selected for the All-Academic Big Eight team in 1991. Early years Gilbert grew up in Detroit, Michigan with parents Leroy and Ann Brown, older brother Wes, and younger siblings, Sheri, Tommy and Anna (all of whom went to college and became athletes). Like Leroy, Gilbert was athletic and fast. Even his brothers could not run home before Gilbert if he was craving a biscuit. During his career at Mackenzie High School, he recorded 189 tackles and 19 sacks. His senior year culminated in all-state honors. Brown also lettered in track, competing in the shot put. He graduated from high school in 1989. College career Back in high school, Gilbert never looked at big-time football factories such as Michigan. He wanted to get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, \\"The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other.\\" With the Jayhawks, Brown helped build a winning program along with fellow defensive lineman and future NFL first round pick Dana Stubblefield (Kansas went to the Aloha Bowl in '92). But Brown went through more difficult times during his college years: a friend Brown had just met on campus died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis, and Brown's father died of congestive heart failure during Brown's senior year. He started all but 2 games in four seasons at the University of Kansas (1989‚Äì92), and was tied for sixth in school history in tackles by a defensive lineman with 168, fifth in career tackles for loss with 30, and had 7¬Ω career sacks. He finished second on the team in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles recovered in 1991 while helping the Jayhawks hold opponents to an average of 150.9 yards per game on the ground, which was the best run defense at Kansas since 1968 at the time. A year earlier, as a sophomore, was named as the Jayhawks‚Äô ‚ÄòCo-Defensive Most Valuable Player‚Äô and earned second team All-Big Eight Conference recognition. Brown started nine games at nose guard as a freshman...An All-Academic Big Eight selection in 1991. He came up with the \\"Gravedigger\\" move at Kansas‚Äîafter a big defensive hit, he would dig an imaginary grave, which became his trademark and nickname. He majored in human development. Professional career Brown was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first training camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, picked him up on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament. Again in 1995, he played, but an elbow injury cut that season short. In 1996, he started all 16 games next to Santana Dotson, Sean Jones and Reggie White, a defensive unit that allowed a league record low 19 touchdowns. Brown had a career-high 51 tackles, and his first complete 16 game season. Brown became a fan favorite, partly because he was easy to spot, and partly because of his eccentric gravedigger dance. During the 1996 season, it became known that Brown would regularly order the \\"Gilbertburger\\" ‚Äî a Double Whopper with extra everything, cut in half with extra cheese, no pickles ‚Äî always obtained from the Oneida Street Burger King in Green Bay. Burger King even made it available for a short time as a promotion in Wisconsin Burger King restaurants. Brown was a highly sought after free agent after the 1996 season, but he elected to take a pay cut to stay with the Packers. On February 18, 1997, he signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract, which was 10 times his 1996 salary, but was about $1 million less than the offer he received from Jacksonville. He said that he would rather stay with the team and fans that he knew and loved. Many people thought that he started getting bigger around that time, and thought that he was as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. \\"That was outrageous, I never got that big,\\" said Brown. \\"The biggest I ever got up to was maybe 350, something like that.\\" But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994. After playing all 16 games during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he spent the 2000 season out of football after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds ‚Äî and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, \\"If I didn‚Äôt think I could do this anymore, I wouldn't be here\\". Brown had two good years after his return to football. However, he ruptured a biceps during the 2003 pre-season, but played on without having surgery. He recorded 14 tackles, one fumble recovery (the first of his career) and one pass defensed. In a victory over Chicago (Dec. 7), Brown posted a season-high four stops, along with a pass breakup. On March 2, 2004, the Packers released Brown. He had played 125 Packers games (103 starts) with 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. He also played in 15 Packers playoff games. In franchise history, only Brett Favre (22), Mason Crosby (18) and Aaron Rodgers (16) have more. In 2014, Brown made the NFL Top 10 list of \\"Big Guys\\" at #2. Life after football Gilbert was featured in the Sports Illustrated special, \\"Where Are They Now?\\", featuring former professional athletes and what they are up to. Brown is currently a co-owner of the Milwaukee Mile, a racetrack that is often used for NASCAR races and at one time was the Packers' part-time home field. Gilbert even claims that he will occasionally fit his massive frame inside a race car and take a few laps. Gilbert, with the strong influence of his mother and family, felt that he wanted to give something back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish. In 2002, he combined his love for cars with his desire to give back when he organized a car show, Gilbert Brown and Friends, in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, which benefited the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Galesville, Wisconsin establishment Champions Sports Bar and Grill has a burger named in Brown's honor: the Gravedigger burger, which weighs in at 93 ounces (just over 5¬æ lbs). The weight of the burger is a callback to Brown's jersey number, which was 93. On October 23, 2007, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League announced that Brown had signed a three-year contract to be the team's new head coach. The Bonecrushers began their season in March. However On Tuesday, April 8, 2008, Gilbert Brown resigned as head coach of the Milwaukee Bonecrushers citing irreconcilable differences with ownership. On December 11, 2007, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, Inc., Tuesday announced Brown would be inducted into the Hall at the 38th Hall of Fame Induction Banquet, to be held the evening of July 19, 2008, in the Lambeau Field Atrium. On August 6, 2009, it was announced that Brown would return to coaching as the first head coach of the expansion La Crosse Spartans of the Indoor Football League. On April 1, 2011, Brown announced he was taking a leave of absence from the La Crosse Spartans.http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/article_0f77bcc6-5bcc-11e0-a988-001cc4c03286.html As of Aug. 2011, Brown is the head coach of the Green Bay Chill of the Lingerie Football League, which was later renamed as the Legends Football League. On March 12, 2014 Gilbert Brown and his project partner, the Vistelar Group, launched an IndieGoGo project to raise money for the production/development/distribution of curriculum to counteract bullying, called the Bully-Proofing Playbook for Parents, Teachers & Kids.http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bully-proofing-playbook-for-parents- teachers-kids/ References Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Kansas Jayhawks football players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Indoor Football League coaches Category:People from Farmington, Michigan ","title":"Gilbert Brown"},{"id":"4156355","text":"AND 1 Streetball is a streetball video game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, developed by Black Ops Entertainment and published by Ubisoft.

She has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, The Awakening Land, set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley. She became a centenarian in September 2019.https://www.timestelegram.com/news/20190904/tinseltown-talks-dancer- marge-champion-turns-100?template=ampart Early years Champion was born on September 2, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Hollywood dance director Ernest Belcher and his wife, Gladys Lee Baskette (n√©e Rosenberg). She had an older half sister, Lina Basquette, who already was acting in silent films at the age of twelve. Lina was the daughter of her mother's first husband, Frank Baskette, who had committed suicide. Marjorie began dancing at an early age as her sister had done. She began dancing as a child under the instruction of her father, Ernest Belcher, a noted Hollywood ballet coach who trained Shirley Temple, Cyd Charisse, and Gwen Verdon. She studied exclusively with her father from age five until she left for New York. She credits her good health and long career to her father's teaching principles: careful, strict progression of activity, emphasis on correct alignment, precise placement of body, attention to detail and to the totality of dynamics and phrasing. Her first dance partner was Louis Hightower.‚ÄúMarge Celeste Belcher .‚Äù Marge Belcher and Gower Champion, freepages.rootsweb.com/~genbel/genealogy/mayjune2006/champion.html. In 1930, she made her debut in the Hollywood Bowl at age 11 in the ballet \\"Carnival in Venice\\". By age twelve, she became a ballet instructor at her father's studio. Marge played Tina in the Hollywood High School operetta The Red Mill. She also sang in the Hollywood High School Girls' Senior Glee Club and graduated in 1936. She was hired by The Walt Disney Studio as a dance model for their animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Her movements were copied to enhance the realism of the animated Snow White figure.

Belcher later modeled for characters in other animated films: the Blue Fairy in Pinocchio (1940) and Hyacinth Hippo in the Dance of the Hours segment of Fantasia, a ballet parody that she also helped choreograph. She even recalls doing some modeling for Mr.Stork in Dumbo. When working with Disney on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Champion recalls \\"the animators couldn't take a young girl out of themselves, they couldn't take the prints out of themselves\\". Marriage and family In 1937, Marge Belcher married Art Babbitt (1907‚Äì1992), a top animator at Disney and creator of Goofy. They divorced in 1940.

Career The very first picture Belcher remembers being in was The Castles with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This gave her a feeling that she would really like to do movies but what she really wanted to do was go to New York and be in New York shows. Sadly, Belcher wasn't tall enough not even for ballet, which is what she trained all her life for. Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including their first MGM musical Till the Clouds Roll By (1946), Show Boat (1951) and Everything I Have Is Yours (1952).

He was born in Pellio Superiore in the Val d'Intelvi, near Como. At the age of 23, as an already an accomplished plasterer, he moved to Prague. He would build several different Jesuit churches and cloisters there, including some at the Clementinum, in the early baroque style. His first commission was the stucco decoration on the gothic St. Saviour Church in Prague. He also worked on the Saint Eligius Chapel there in 1654, before his work was redone by Domenico Orsi. Lurago was also successful outside of Bohemia. He developed the plans for the Passau Cathedral. It is notable because the main altar has a series of flat elliptical domes. This arch design foreshadows many other buildings of the baroque style. Another notable example of his work is the pilgrimage church of Maria Taferl, which had to be completed by Jakob Prandtauer after Lurago died in Passau.

It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on April 16, 1985 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1986. History A member of the Dandridge family, cousins of America's first First Lady (Martha Washington), is believed to have built Bride's Hill. Its deep cellar, lighted by oblong ground-level windows, houses a basement kitchen-dining room. On the main floor a broad central hall, with a graceful reverse-flight stairway rising to the low half-story above, separates two large rooms. Allegedly a separate brick kitchen structure once stood to the rear. When absorbed into the vast Joseph Wheeler estate in 1907, the house and surrounding farm became known as Sunnybrook. Located in rural Lawrence County, the house has been unoccupied since the 1980s and is in a state of disrepair. Architecture Brought to the early Alabama plantation frontier by settlers from the Tidewater and Piedmont regions of Virginia, this vernacular house-type is usually a story-and-a-half in height, and characterized by prominent end chimneys flanking a steeply pitched roof often pierced by dormer windows.

The mountains are mostly within Iringa Region, south of Tanzania's capital Dodoma. The Udzungwa Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species. The mountains are home to the Hehe people, and the name Udzungwa comes from the Kihehe word ‚ÄúWadzungwa\\", which means the people who live on mountainsides. Iringa is the largest settlement in the mountains, and the regional headquarters. Geography The Undzungwa Mountains cover an area of 16,131.40 km¬≤, the largest of the Eastern Arc ranges.N. D. Burgess et al. (2007). \\"The biological importance of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya\\". Biological Conservation 134 (2007) pp. 209‚Äì231. The highest peak in the range is Luhombero at .Lonely Planet, Mary Fitzpatrick, Ray Bartlett, David Else, Anthony Ham, Helena Smith (2018). Lonely Planet Tanzania Travel Guide. Lonely Planet, 2018. The mountain range extends generally northeast- southwest. The Usangu Plain lies to the northwest, drained by the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries. The Great Ruaha River separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Rubeho Mountains and Uvidunda Mountains to the northeast. The Kilombero River valley lies to the south and southeast. To the southwest the Makambako Gap separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Kipengere Range. Both the Great Ruaha and Kilombero rivers are tributaries of the Rufiji River, which empties into the Indian Ocean. The Lukosi River originates in the central part of the range, and empties eastwards into the Great Ruaha. The Little Ruaha River and its tributaries drain much of the western portion of the range, emptying northwards into the Great Ruaha. Climate The Udzungwa Mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, and receive more rainfall than the surrounding lowlands. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and southeastern slopes facing the Indian Ocean, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Geology The Udzungwa Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Flora and fauna About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as \\"islands\\" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Udzungwa and other Eastern Arc mountains has extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species).Newmark, W. D., 2002, Conserving Biodiversity in East African Forests, a Study of the Eastern Arc Mountains. Ecological Studies 155. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 197 10 percent of them are protected by the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and the Udzungwa Scarp Nature Forest Reserve. The Udzungwa Mountains are covered with lowland rainforest, montane rainforest, miombo woodland, grassland, and heathland. Forests extend from 300 to 2579 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. The wetter eastern and southeastern slopes receive more rain from the Indian Ocean and support evergreen forests on the lower slopes; the drier western and northwestern slopes have decidious miombo forests and woodlands at lower elevations and evergreen forests only at higher elevations.N.

The Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis) is an endemic species, with its closest relatives appearing to be the hill partridges of Asia. Elephants (Loxodonta africana) are found in the forests along the southern escarpment.N. D. Burgess et al. (2007). \\"The biological importance of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya\\". Biological Conservation 134 (2007) pp. 209‚Äì231 Although the two mountain groups are ecologically distinct, the Eastern Arc Mountains share many species and plant communities with the Southern Highlands which lie to the southwest across the Makambako Gap. Both are Afromontane regions, home to characteristic montane species and ecologically distinct from the adjacent lowlands. The Southern Highlands' climate is more influenced by Lake Malawi than by the Indian Ocean. Some limited-range montane species, including the Kipunji and Kipengere seedeater (Crithagra melanochrous), inhabit both the Udzungwa Mountains and the Kipengere Range. The Kihansi spray toad (Nectophrynoides asperginis), which was found only around a waterfall on the Kihansi River, became extinct in the wild in 2009 when an upstream dam altered its habitat.

Plot Dr. Shrinker (Jay Robinson) is a mad scientist who creates a shrinking ray that can miniaturize anything. Three young adults ‚Äî Brad Fulton (Ted Eccles), B.J. Masterson (Susan Lawrence) and her brother Gordie Masterson (Jeff MacKay) ‚Äî crash land their airplane on an island. As they make their way to the only house on the island, they meet Dr. Shrinker and his assistant, Hugo (Billy Barty). Dr. Shrinker, in an effort to prove that his shrinking ray works, shrinks the three people down to tall. The remainder of the series was different efforts by the 'Shrinkies' to return to normal size, while Dr. Shrinker and Hugo want to catch the trio so that they will have physical proof that the ray works for whatever world power wants to buy it. Dr. Shrinker also implied that he would give the unnamed buyer the Shrinkies as a free bonus. However, in one episode, Dr. Shrinker's plan was to sell the shrinking ray to the highest bidder, and the second highest bidder would receive the Shrinkies. Each episode was basically the same. As Dr. Shrinker himself said in one episode...\\"I chase the Shrinkies. I catch the Shrinkies. The Shrinkies escape. It's a vicious cycle, and it's driving me mad!\\" The concept was very likely inspired by the 1940 film Dr. Cyclops in which a scientist working in the South American jungle uses his radiation experiments to shrink a group of fellow scientists to prevent them from discovering his secret work. Dr. Shrinker lasted only one season on The Krofft Supershow. During the second season, it was dropped (as was the superhero segment Electra Woman and Dyna Girl). One episode, \\"Slowly I Turn\\", is available on DVD with the Krofft Box Set. In 2005, Marty Krofft said that he and his brother would be recording commentary for a DVD release of Dr. Shrinker.

This could be because they have a short- or long-term illness, have been excluded, or are a new starter waiting for a mainstream school place. Each LEA has a duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school. Placing pupils in PRUs is just one of the ways in which local authorities can ensure that they can comply with this duty. PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.

After his playing career he served as an official. Playing career Burk played college football at Baylor University and was drafted in the first round of the 1950 NFL Draft. Burk is one of eight NFL quarterbacks (Sid Luckman, George Blanda, Joe Kapp, Y. A. Tittle, Peyton Manning, Nick Foles, and Drew Brees) who share the record of seven touchdown passes in one regular season game. He threw seven touchdown passes on October 17, 1954, when the Eagles won 49‚Äì21 over the Washington Redskins. Three of his touchdown passes were to Eagles end Pete Pihos. Burk graduated from Baylor Law School and became general counsel to the Houston Oilers. Officiating career Burk later worked as an NFL official as a back judge (now field judge), wearing uniform number 63. He worked the game that saw Joe Kapp of the Minnesota Vikings tie his record for seven touchdown passes in one game in 1969 vs. the Baltimore Colts. Burk was also the back judge in the famous 1972 playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers. That game, played in Pittsburgh, featured the play that came to be called the \\"Immaculate Reception\\". From his position as back judge, Burk was the first of the officials to signal a touchdown. During a 1973 game between the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos, Bears coach Abe Gibron can be heard chewing out Burk throughout the contest. Gibron was miked for the game by NFL Films, and the footage was released by NFL Films Executive Director Steve Sabol in 2001.

Discovered by the indigenous people, the falls were called Ga-ha-oose or Ga- ho'n'-yoos by the Mohawks, which is believed to mean \\"The Place of the Falling Canoe.\\" Cohoes historian Arthur Masten wrote in his 1880 history that the phrase might mean \\"Potholes in the River,\\" referring to the potholes that appear in the riverbed when it is dry. In the oral tradition of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), the Cohoes Falls are the site where The Great Peacemaker, performed a feat of supernatural strength, convincing the Mohawk people to become the founders of the Iroquois League of Nations or Confederacy. Some historians believe the Mohawks launched the Confederacy as early as 1142 CE, though other experts report dates ranging from 1450‚Äì1650. Early illustration (1772) of Kohoes Falls, from the book En Resa til Norra America by Pehr Kalm. Celebrated by 18th-century travelers in letters and journals, the Cohoes Falls, also called The Great Falls of the Mohawk, were regarded as the second-most beautiful cataract in New York State after Niagara. In 1804, the national poet of Ireland, Thomas Moore, visited Cohoes and wrote a paean to the waterfall's beauty: \\"Lines Written at the Cohos, or Falls of the Mohawk River.\\" In 1831, town leaders built a dam across the Mohawk River to harness the power of the falls to fuel the turbines of the city's burgeoning textile industry. Over the next several decades, the predominant company, Harmony Mills, became the largest manufacturer of cotton in the United States, thanks to its control of local water rights. When all the mills closed in the wake of the Great Depression, city leaders leased the flow rights to a series of power companies, including Niagara Mohawk and Orion Power. Cohoes Falls in winter, with very low water flow Cohoes Falls in spring, with a high volume Cohoes Falls in April, dry The Erie Canal was planned to overcome the navigational barrier of the Cohoes Falls. The original \\"Clinton's Ditch\\", the Erie Canal of 1825, was built through the city of Cohoes. The later Enlarged Canal was realigned, yet still went through the City of Cohoes. The Barge Canal, which opened in 1918, bypasses Cohoes and runs through the Village of Waterford via the Waterford Flight of Locks. The Cohoes Falls is 90 feet (28 m) high and 1,000 feet (305 m) wide. Its flow is greatest in springtime, sometimes running at of water per second. The flow varies with seasonal variation of Mohawk River flow as well as with diversions for the Barge Canal locks, power generation, and the Cohoes water supply. During the summer, the falls are virtually dry, revealing shale rock formations that have their own distinctive beauty. The 87-year average flow of the Mohawk River at Cohoes is 34,638 cubic feet per second, but this includes water diverted to the power plant and Erie Canal locks. Cohoes Falls compared to Niagara Falls *The width of Cohoes Falls is roughly , while Niagara Falls' width is for American Falls and for Horseshoe Falls *The height of Cohoes Falls ranges from on the north side to on the south end. Niagara Falls' height is 70 to for American Falls and for Horseshoe Falls. *Water flow over Cohoes Falls ranges from zero to 90,000 cubic feet per second. (During Hurricane Irene in August 2011, the flow was estimated to be over 100,000 cubic feet per second with a total river flow of 117,000.) Water flow over Niagara Falls ranges from 5,000 to 21,000 cubic feet per second for American Falls and 45,000 to 190,000 cubic feet per second for Horseshoe Falls. *Cohoes Falls generates about 190,000 megawatt hours (i.e. 190 gigawatt hours) of electricity a year.

The Usambara Mountains of northeastern Tanzania in tropical East Africa, comprise the easternmost ranges of the Eastern Arc Mountains. The ranges of approximately long and about half that wide, are situated in the Lushoto District of the Tanga Region. They were formed nearly two million years ago by faulting and uplifting, and are composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks. They are split into two sub-ranges; the West Usambaras being higher than the East Usambaras, which are nearer the coast and receive more rainfall. The mountains are clad in virgin tropical rainforest which has been isolated for a long period and they are a centre of endemism. Historically they were inhabited by Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people but in the eighteenth century, a Shambaa kingdom was founded by Mbegha. The kingdom eventually fell apart after a succession struggle in 1862. German colonists settled in the area which was to become German East Africa, and after World War I it became part of the British mandated territory of Tanganyika. Geography The Usambaras are approximately long and ranging from in width. They form part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, which stretch from Kenya through Tanzania. The range is one of the world's Biodiversity hotspots. The range is accessible from the towns of Lushoto in the west, and Amani in the east. The Usambaras are commonly split into two sub-ranges, the West Usambara Mountains and the East Usambara Mountains. The East Usambara are closer to the coast, receive more rainfall, and are significantly smaller than the West Usambara. Geology The mountain range was formed nearly two million years ago. Due to a lack of glaciations and a relatively consistent climate, the rainforest has gone through a long term and unique evolution resulting in an impressive amount of endemism and an old-growth cloud rainforests. The West and East Usambaras are large ranges of Precambrian metamorphic geologic formations of acid-gneisses, pyroxenes, and amphiboles. These mountains were formed by faulting and uplifting creating the drainage system of troughs that form many watersheds, which provide water to a majority of the population of northeast Tanzania.Lundgren 1980 Ecology The Usambara Mountains are fairly unusual in East Africa with their natural regions still covered in tropical forests, which otherwise continentally remain primarily in Western Africa. Considered tremendously significant ecologically and a Biodiversity hotspot. There are many protected zones throughout the range, which are being expanded and contributed to by the Tanzanian government, associated NGO's and research teams, and donor countries such as Norway. Several species are endemic to the Usambara forests, including the Usambara eagle-owl (Bubo vosseleri), the Usambara akalat (Sheppardia montana), the Usambara weaver (Ploceus nicolli), the African violet (Saintpaulia ionantha), the tree species Calodendrum eickii. Human history Historically the Usambara Mountains have been inhabited by the Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people who were a mix of agriculturalists and pastoralists. A Shambaa kingdom based on Vugu was founded by Mbegha in the first half of the 18th century. His grandson Kinyashi Muanga Ike gave the kingdom a stronger political and military structure. Under Kinyashi's son Kimweri ye Nyumbai the kingdom grew to cover both the west and east Usambaras, extending down to the coast and into the Pangani River valley to the south. After Kimweri died in 1862 the kingdom fell apart in a succession struggle.UsambaraMountains.com In the late 19th century when within the Usambara District of German East Africa, German colonialists came into the area bringing with them a mix of cash crops like lumber trees, coffee, tea, and quinine, and also designated forests as reserves for either water conservation or timber use.Rogers 2009 They also brought many new Western concepts, which often were diametrically opposed to traditional beliefs, such as coexistence with the forest versus forest as a \\"separate wilderness\\".Korschun 2007 The result of colonialism was a massive change in the way forests were perceived in the community, and conversion of traditional agriculture to cultivating cash crops such as quinine, pine trees, bananas, maize, tea, and coffee. In 1882 Adalbert Emil Walter Redliffe le Tanneux von St. Paul-Ilaire (known as Baron Walter), the Governor of the Usambara District of German East Africa, collected seed and plants of a small herb which were sent to Hermann Wendland, Director of the Berlin Royal Botanic Garden. Wendland cultivated the plants and recognized them as representing a new species in a new genus, Saintpaulia ionantha, with the English common name African violet. In the generic name. Saintpaulia he recognized von St. Paul- Ilaire; the specific name he assigned means violet (Gr. ion) flower (Gr. anthos). In their native Usambara Mountains cloudforests, the plants are threatened with extinction.Our Vegetable Kingdom: global timetable of botany, agriculture, and horticulture history. . accessed 4.29.2015 Following World War I, it became part of the British mandate territory of Tanganyika. The British administration continued to reserve and exploit forests. Development and tourism Today, the population of the Usambara Mountains region has one of the highest growth rates (about 4% compared to the Tanzanian national average of 2.1%), a staggering amount of poverty, and highest densities of people in all of Tanzania.R. Matthews 2009 Most of the inhabitants are subsistence farmers who rely heavily on the forests around them for timber, medicinal plants, clearing for agriculture, and fuelwood.S. Kiparo 2009 70% of the original forest cover of the West and East Usambaras has been lost. Its ecosystems were significantly disrupted by foreign-controlled logging companies that carried out large-scale deforestation from the 1950s onwards. A sawmill at Tanga processed East Usambara timber, and its output was increased in the 1970s with Finnish development funding. Major land and forest degradation remains a pressing issue. There are still many places that attract visitors looking for experiences beyond developed tourist resorts. These include the trade town of Lushoto (German colonial era Wilhelmsthal), the once-popular German resort Amani Nature Reserve and farm, and the Mazumbai University Forest, which is considered the last example of pristine tropical forest in the East Usambaras.

The Wali Khan faction was later named National Awami Party (NAP) after the separation of East Pakistan. The NAP was banned twice during its eight-year-long existence, the first time under Yahya Khans government in 1971 and the second time in 1975 by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government. It was then resurrected under the name National Democratic Party, from which in turn was formed the Awami National Party.NAP spelt anew by Rahimullah Yousafzai. THE NEWs retrieved 5-2-2006 The Party represented left wing views in Pakistan and its core politics was based on the disbanding of the One Unit, restoration of adult franchise (1967‚Äì1970), land reforms, protection of tenants' rights, redistribution of wealth through nationalisation, Pakistan becoming a confederacy as well as the holding of fair elections, protection of an independent judiciary and freedom of the press.The Emergence of the Federal Pattern in Pakistan Malik Journal of Asian and African Studies.1973; 8: 205-215 It contested the 1970 election, winning the second largest number of seats in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the largest in Baluchistan, and a handful of seats in East Pakistan's provincial assembly. It failed to win any seats in Punjab and Sindh. After the division of Pakistan in 1971, NAP formed coalition governments in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan on the basis of winning majority of seats in the two provinces. Arbab Sikandar Khan was appointed Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Ghaus Bux Bizenjo Governor of Balochistan. Sardar Akhtar Mengal was elected the first Chief Minister of Balochistan and the NAP supported Mufti Mahmud of the JUI as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A brief attempt was made to resurrect the Party by Ajmal Khattak under the name National Awami Party of Pakistan in 2000, however the party was routed in the 2002 election and much of its leadership merged back with the ANP.  Party Formation  On 30 November 1967 the NAP split between Maulana Bhashani and Khan Wali Khan, ostensibly because Bhashani sided with China while Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, along with Khan Abdul Wali Khan, sided with the USSR in the Sino-Soviet split. Following the split, the leftist members of the NAP, many of whom were active in a Kissan (peasant) Committee, decided to follow the Wali Khan faction. Soon after, the leadership of the Wali Khan faction, being landlords, decided not to allow members of the NAP to also be members of the Kissan Committee. The leftists, led by Afzal Bangash, then decided to leave the NAP and establish the Mazdoor Kisan Party. The NAP party leadership struggling with a rivalry between Mahmud Ali Kasuri and Mahmudul Haq Usmani for the Presidency. Ultimately the leadership backed Abdul Wali Khan as a compromise candidate. The National Council of the Party met on 30 June and 1 July 1968 at Royal Hotel, Peshawar, with Professor Muzaffar Ahmed, President of East Pakistan NAP chairing the first session. Abdul Wali Khan was unanimously elected as President of the party.B.M. Kutty (2009). In Search of Solutions: The Autobiography Of Mir Ghaus Buksh Bizenjo.

The theory advocated by senior NAP leader Bizenjo stated Pakistan was composed of four distinct \\"nations\\", the Pukhtun, Baloch, Sindhi and Western Punjabi.  1970 Elections and Aftermath  The party contested the 1970 elections from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh and East Pakistan. It did not field any candidates in the Punjab, Nationally it fielded 16 candidates from K-P, three of whom got elected, securing 18.4% of the vote, in Balochistan three out of four candidates were elected but it failed to win any seats from Sindh.Mushtaq Ahmed(1971) Politics without Social Change, Karachi: Space Publishers, In 1971, in an attempt to avert a possible showdown between the Military and the people of East Pakistan, on March 23, 1971, Khan, along with other Pakistani politicians, jointly met Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. They offered support to Mujeeb in the formation of a government, but it was already too late to break the impasse as Yahya Khan had already decided on a full scale military crackdown. Pakistan's increasing vulnerability and widespread international outrage against the military crackdown eventually created a situation that led to war between Pakistan and India. This war proved disastrous and culminated in Pakistan's armed forces being defeated in East Pakistan and the creation of the new state of Bangladesh. Shocked by the defeat, Yahya Khan resigned from office and the military. Under General Gul Hassan Khan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was brought back from America and appointed President. During the martial law crackdown against East Pakistan, the National Awami Party under Wali Khan was one of a handful of parties that protested the military operation. In one case, Khan helped a senior East Pakistani diplomat's son escape to Afghanistan from possible internment in West Pakistan.Zeitlin, Arnold e-mail exchange with the author (14 June 2006) The military government, in retaliation against the protests, banned the party and launched mass arrests of party activists.HP (January 25, 2006) Khan Abdul Wali Khan: His Fathers Shadow?

Retrieved March 10, 2006 Tripartite Agreement In 1972, as the opposition leader, Wali Khan was contacted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who wanted to lift martial law and set up a new constitution. Wali Khan's negotiations with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto led to the NAP signing of an agreement with the government in 1972, called the Tripartite Agreement.Ahmed Feroz Interview with Wali Khan,(Jun ‚Äì Jul., 1972), Pakistan Forum, Vol. 2, No. 9/10 pp. 11‚Äì13+18 The agreement led to the lifting of martial law and removal of the ban on the National Awami Party. This led to the formation of National Awami Party coalition provincial governments in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. Despite the initial positive start, the agreement rapidly began to unravel due to the growing animosity between Khan and Bhutto. National Opposition Party In 1972, Wali Khan was elected as Parliamentary leader of the opposition, the NAP made several initiatives to broaden its support across the country.Tahir Amin,(1993) Ethno-Nationalist Movements of Pakistan, Islamabad: IPS, It dropped its demand to rename the then North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunistan, declared Urdu as the provincial language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and espoused federalism with greater autonomy for the provinces. Senior party leader Ghaus Bux Bizenjo advocated that Pakistan consisted of four nationalities and their empowerment equally would prevent the breakup of Pakistan.The Idea of a Pakistani Nationhood (1980)Anwar H.

Public anger amongst ethnic Pashtuns ran high, as almost all the dead and most of the wounded were from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and were mostly members of the National Awami Party. The enraged party workers and followers wanted to parade the dead bodies on the streets in Peshawar and other cities of the province, and provoke a full scale confrontation. Wali Khan rejected this notion and held back his infuriated party cadres, escorting the dead bodies to Peshawar; he had them buried quietly with their bereaved families. Following the massacre the Federal Security Force launched a crackdown against the party that led to many senior leaders including Ajmal Khattak to flee into exile to Kabul.  Balochistan crisis  The Balochistan government immediately faced multiple crise,s the first of which was when the Balochistan police department, mostly officered by people from Punjab or Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. As there was a provision that employees in the federating provinces would return to their province of origin after the dissolution of the One Unit. Most of the officers insisted on leaving. Despite this fact, Sardar Ataullah Mengal as chief minister, moved a resolution in the Balochistan Assembly to do away with the domicile as a qualification and suggested that those who had spent several generations in the province should be treated as locals. It was later on alleged that the officers were incited to leave through the efforts of PPP supporters and the then Chief Minister of Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar. Unable to exercise any effective authority Ataullah Mengal turned to the Baloch Student Organization to assist in security. The policing crisis also gave way to a subsequent intra-tribal conflict. The Baloch nationalists declared that it was fomented by the then Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan but without evidence to prove the statements issued.  London Conspiracy  However, the final straw was the discovery of arms in the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and Nawab Akbar Bugti's declaration of the London Plan, that alleged that NAP-led governments in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was seceding to gain independence from Pakistan. Hence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government, fresh from the humiliation of 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War used the pretext of arms shipment from Iraq to dismember Pakistan and dismissed the Balochistan provincial government in 1973, in protest against the decision the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government resigned in protest.National Awami Party declassified documents Ataullah Mengal and his colleagues, including Ghaus Bux Bizenjo and Khair Bakhsh Marri were arrested along with other NAP leaders.  Hyderabad Tribunal  In the face of an increasingly strong national campaign led by the NAP against the government, Bhutto banned NAP on February 8, 1975 after the murder of his close colleague Hayat Khan Sherpao, throwing thousands of its workers and much of its leadership, including party President Khan Abdul Wali Khan, in jail for alleged anti-state activities.Cowasjee (25 April 1996) Old Hat. The Dawn. The DAWN groupMazari, Sherbaz Khan (1999) A Journey into disillusionmentOxford University Press Invoking the 1st amendment of the 1973 constitution the government charged Wali Khan and his colleagues under the Hyderabad Conspiracy Case in 1976, although they were acquitted of the charge of the murder of PPP stalwart Hayat Khan Sherpao, the decision to ban the NAP was upheld by the courts. In addition to Khan Abdul Wali Khan, the case also implicated two governors, two chief ministers, scores of national and provincial parliamentarians, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Kaswar Gardezi, Habib Jalib (Urdu revolutionary poet) and Mir Gul Khan Nasir (Balochi Revolutionary Poet/Leader) and even some of Bhutto‚Äôs former colleagues, many of whom were later re- elected and became federal or provincial ministers.Progressive Movements in Pakistan collection  National Democratic Party formed  With the NAP leadership largely imprisoned, a new political party was formed on the wreckage of the NAP in 1976 by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. Named National Democratic Party (NDP), it was headed by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The Hyderabad case was withdrawn after General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq imposed martial law in July 1977. Wali Khan left party affairs to Sher Baz Mazari after his release from jail in 1979. The party faced a split at that time between far left elements led by Khair Bakhsh Marri advocating outright separation and armed struggle and those advocating political struggle led by Sherbaz Khan Mazari. The split ended the alliance between Pashtun Nationalists and Baloch Nationalists that Wali Khan had formed in 1969 and led to the formation of the Pakistan National Party. Sherbaz Khan Mazari led the NDP into joining the Movement for Restoration of Democracy. The alliance with former rivals the PPP did not go down well with Ghaffar Khan who encouraged by Governor Fazle Haq warned Ghaffar Khan of what would happen if the PPP returned to power. This move led to a split between Mazari and Wali Khan which were aggravated after Wali Khan in a statement rejected the 1973 constitution and Wali Khan's election as NDP President. The NDP was merged with other nationalist parties from Balochistan and Sindh in 1986 in Karachi to launch a new political party named Awami National Party with Wali Khan as its president and Rasul Bux Palejo as its general-secretary.

With sections on evolution, creationism, geology, astronomy and hominid evolution, the web site provides broad coverage of evolutionary biology and the socio-political antievolution movement. Origins and history The TalkOrigins Archive began in 1994 when Brett J. Vickers collected several separately posted FAQs from the talk.origins newsgroup and made them available from a single anonymous FTP site. In 1995, Vickers, then a computer science graduate student at the University of California at Irvine, created the TalkOrigins Archive web site. In 2001, Vickers transferred the TalkOrigins Archive to Wesley R. Elsberry, who organized a group of volunteers to handle the maintenance of the Archive. In 2004, Kenneth Fair incorporated the TalkOrigins Foundation as a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The Foundation's purposes include funding and maintaining the TalkOrigins Archive and holding copyrights to Archive articles, thereby simplifying the process of reprinting and updating those articles. The copyright issue has posed a particular problem since the FAQs started off as a small collection with little thought given to copyright but have since mushroomed. In 2005, the Foundation was granted tax-exempt status by the IRS. Features The FAQs and FRAs (Frequently Rebutted Assertions) on the TalkOrigins Archive cover a wide range of topics associated with evolutionary biology and creationism. These include Mark Isaak's Index to Creationist Claims, a list of creationist positions on various issues, rebuttals, and links to primary source material. The TalkDesign site fulfills a similar role with the Intelligent Design movement. Also hosted is Jim Foley's Fossil Hominids sub-site which studies the evidence for human evolution and has an extensive list of links to websites on both evolutionary biology and creationism. Lastly, the Quote Mine Project examines the use of Quote miningtaking quotes out of contextby creationists. The feedback system collects reader comments and posts a compilation, along with responses, each month. The archive maintains a sister site which addresses Intelligent Design arguments. Awards and recognition Talkorigins.org has gained awards and recognition over the years: * In 1999, The New York Times called TalkOrigins a \\"good antidote\\" to the plethora of creationist websites that had sprung up. * The webpages of the National Academy of Science, Smithsonian Institution, Leakey Foundation, the National Center for Science Education and other organizations recommend Talkorigins.org. * In August 2002, Scientific American recognized Talkorigins.org for its \\"detailed discussions (some of which may be too sophisticated for casual readers) and bibliographies relating to virtually any objection to evolution that creationists might raise.\\" * In October 2006, The Dallas Morning News awarded it Web Site of the Week. The Archive is also referenced in college-level textbooks and has had material from the archive incorporated into over 20 college or university courses.

Hughes was replaced successively by Adrian Workman and then by Tony Locke. They recorded three 12 inch extended plays for Red Eye before recording a studio album, Introversion, in 1991 which was shelved due to record company disputes until July 1996. Meanwhile, they issued their first album, Hypnotised, in May 1992 via Karmic Hit/Shock, and disbanded in 1998. The group reformed in 2008 to record a new album, Unfamiliar Places, released in May 2011.  History  The Bhagavad Guitars were formed in 1985 as Inner Circle in Canberra by Jeremy Butterworth on guitar, vocals and flute, John Underwood (a.k.a. John Kilbey) on guitar and vocals, Kynan Hughes on bass guitar and Matt Kerr on drums. As teenagers they had played together in a band while students at Dickson College. In 1987 they relocated to Sydney and renamed themselves, the new name, \\"was derived from a pun on the title of the Hindu book Bhagavad Gita.\\" Butterworth later reflected, \\"We started off seriously interested in Eastern thinking, different philosophies, meditation... etc but now we're more cynical.\\" In July 1988 they released their debut five-track extended play, Foreverglades, which was produced by the Church's Steve Kilbey (Underwood's older brother) for Red Eye Records. Its \\"featured track, 'Just to Be Sure' became a radio hit in Sydney.\\" They followed in October with a six-track EP, Headland, where Hughes had been replaced on bass guitar by Adrian Workman. Red Eye compiled the two EPs, leaving off \\"Shrine\\" from Headland, into a full- length album, also titled, Foreverglades, in July 1990. They followed with a third EP, Party, with six tracks, in October of that year. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, \\"The band's brand of spacious, chiming guitar-based pop called to mind the likes of The Crystal Set, The Church and UK band Simple Minds.\\" The group's album, Introversion, was recorded in 1991 but did not appear until July 1996 on Karmic Hit/Shock Records. It included, \\"a bonus 14-minute CD EP Extraversion.\\" The album was engineered and co- produced with legendary Australian, Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds). In 1992 Kilbey formed a record label, Karmic Hit, which issued the group's single, \\"Hypnotise Me\\" in February. They followed with their first studio album, Hypnotised, in May 1992 with Tony Locke on bass guitar and lead vocals for two tracks, \\"Romeo Error\\" and \\"Accident\\". After the Bhagavad Guitars separated, Kilbey released three solo albums, Nothing More Than Something to Wear (February 2003) as John Kilbey, Catching Some Z's (2004) as J.L.K. and Good Fortunes (March 1999) by the Penny Drops. Kilbey was part of a band, Warp Factor 9, which released an album, 5 Days in a Photon Belt, in 1993. The Bhagavad Guitars reformed in 2008 and released another album, Unfamiliar Places, in May 2011.

Founded in 2003 by programmer and photographer Jon Oringer, Shutterstock maintains a library of around 200 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations, with around 10 million video clips and music tracks available for licensing. Originally a subscription site only, Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in 2008. It has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 2012.  History = Founding and early years (2003‚Äì2011)  Shutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer. Creating his own online marketplace, Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription, with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of US$49. When demand exceeded his photo supply, he began hiring additional contributors. In 2006, the firm claimed that it was the \\"largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world\\" with 570,000 images in its collection. The firm branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage. , By 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos. Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year. Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its \\"On Demand\\" service removing daily download limits. On September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency. Fast Company argued the deal put \\"Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStock Photo is also credit- based.\\" Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010. In February 2011, it announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)  Acquisitions and IPO (2012‚Äì2013)  By April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images,. The firm announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed. The product was launched by the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects. In May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK. Shutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new \\"image discovery tool,\\" in March 2013. At the time, the firm had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio. In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads. At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.  Offset and new partnerships (2013‚Äì2014)  In September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists.

Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013, while revenue for 2013 was US$235 million. In March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software. In May 2014, the firm partnered with Salesforce to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio. Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a \\"multi-color image discovery tool.\\" The firm announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014. Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos. Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39 percent from 2013. In 2014, Shutterstock paid \\"over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors.\\"  Recent developments (2015‚Äì2020)  In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency for $33 million, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service, for $32 million. Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive, which included magazines such as Variety, Women's Wear Daily, and Deadline. Crain's wrote that with the partnership, \\"Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways‚Äîand taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images.\\". The company also acquired BEImages, another largest independent photo press agency. By March 2016, the company had \\"over 100,000 contributors,\\" with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale. That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April. According to Entrepreneur, Shutterstock also had an \\"active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries.\\" In July 2016, Shutterstock revealed a partnership with Google advertising products including AdSense, AdWords, and AdMob. The integration allows marketers creating Google ads to directly access Shutterstock images and track ad performance via the Shutterstock API. In October 2016, the firm announced a distribution deal with the European Pressphoto Agency. In February 2018, Shutterstock invested $15 million into China based ZCool, title=Shutterstock Expanding in China via Investment in ZCool publisher=American Entrepreneurship Today date=February 28, 2018 accessdate=February 23, 2019}} building on the operational relationship the two firms have had since 2014 when ZCool first became the exclusive distributor of Shutterstock creative content in China. Webdam, which Shutterstock itself acquired back in 2014, was sold to Amsterdam-based Bynder for $49.1 million to move Shutterstock's strategy away from digital asset management. Shutterstock later enter into a partnership with Tencent Social Ads, the online advertising subsidiary of Tencent. In May 2018, IBM's Watson Content Hub, a content management system (CMS) for marketers to create content using the IBM Watson AI search tool, announced its partnership with Shutterstock,beginning July, 2018. In May 2020, the company announced that it will update its contributor earnings structure as of June 1, from a minimum flat-rate to a percentage-based model. Contributor income may be reduced from the previous minimum payment per downloaded image of 25 cents to 10 cents, or 15 percent of sales, at the entry level, with author ratings reset to zero at the beginning of each year.https://forums.submit.shutterstock.com/topic/100133-new-earnings- structure-for-contributors/ Many photographers voiced their opposition to the new changes.  Facilities and staff  Shutterstock is headquartered in New York. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montr√©al, Paris and San Francisco. After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office, in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building. According to Inc., the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees. The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 \\"pop-in rooms\\" for private meetings and conferences when needed. After its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers. With 295 employees as of October 2013, the firm had grown to 700 employees as of 2016. In 2014, Fast Company published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful \\"intrapreneur\\"-reliant company, touting the company's \\"hackathons\\" for fostering staff creativity. In response to the company censoring results in China, over 180 Shutterstock employees signed a petition against the decision.  Business model  Shutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians, maintaining a library of almost 200 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations. Shutterstock also has 10 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio. While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, The Atlantic wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock \\"pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than √† la carte.\\" The Atlantic further wrote that Shutterstock is \\"a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors.\\" With potential contributors able to apply to the site for free, Shutterstock has a team of reviewers \\"charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality.\\" As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor. As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and \\"less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site.\\" Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the \\"inspection queue\\", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate. Explains VICE, \\"photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer.\\" As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.  Reports of copyright theft  In July 2020, Users at Wikimedia Commons reported widespread copyright theft at Shutterstock. Images from many Wikimedia contributors were hosted on the site. Shutterstock were first made aware of the problem in April 2020, but no action has been taken to remove the images nor any compensation offered. Censorship of results in China In September 2019, engineers at Shutterstock began designing a system to censor results displayed to users with IP addresses in China, with the system being implemented in October 2019. The system returns no results in response to queries such as \\"President Xi\\", \\"Chairman Mao\\", \\"Taiwan flag\\", \\"dictator\\" or \\"yellow umbrella\\".  Products = Shutterstock film and music  Shutterstock began licensing stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis. As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips. Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.  Shutterstock apps  Shutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011, and in May 2012 the app received a Webby Award for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services. Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal iOS app, which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later. The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color. Shutterstock debuted an Android App in 2013, and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.  Shutterstock Labs  In 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for \\"exploratory tools and products.\\" In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time. Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website. The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool \\"indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color.\\" In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.  Computer vision  Shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a \\"convolutional neural network\\" that it created to help with reverse image search technology. The network is \\"essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images ‚Äì there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky ‚Äì and pull up the most relevant photos.\\" It \\"breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords.\\" In March 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to Entrepreneur, with the tool \\"users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo.\\" The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on \\"color schemes, mood, or shapes.\\" Later that month, the firm debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools, with the \\"similar search\\" option provided beneath photos on its website.

Anchor stores include Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, DSW Shoe Warehouse, Macy's, and Target. History= Expansion & Policies  In the early 1980s, a proposal for a two-story indoor mall in Poughkeepsie, New York was submitted. Despite much conflict and many protests, the proposal was submitted, and the mall opened on August 1, 1987 as the Poughkeepsie Galleria Mall. Upon opening, the mall had five anchor stores: G. Fox & Co., Jordan Marsh, Lechmere, Filene's, and JCPenney. Due to underperformance, the Filene's store closed in 1989 and was replaced with Steinbach, which relocated from South Hills Mall next door. Sears also announced plans to relocate from South Hills Plaza at the same time. Steinbach closed in 1995 and became Dick's Sporting Goods and DSW Shoe Warehouse the same year. Filene's returned to the mall in 1993 by taking over the defunct G. Fox chain, while Sears ultimately opened at the mall after Jordan Marsh was vacated. Montgomery Ward also moved into the mall in the early 1990s, becoming the sixth anchor and replacing an existing store in Poughkeepsie. In 2004, both DSW and Dick's moved to new locations vacated by Montgomery Ward, while the former Filene's and Lechmere building was converted to Best Buy and Target. During January 2005, the mall announced it would enact and begin enforcing the Pyramid Companies' \\"MB-18\\" teenage curfew policy beginning in September 2005, following a large fight involving young teenagers in front of then-Filene's. Due to the size of the incident, local police were called, and several arrests were made. Filene's was converted to Macy's in 2006. On February 8, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 39 stores nationwide. The store closed on April 11, 2020. On June 23, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would also be closing as part of a plan to close 155 stores nationwide. The store closed on October 18, 2020. The Justice store closed in August 2020 after parent company Ascena Retail filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  COVID-19 Pandemic  As a result of an executive order to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Galleria announced they would close the interior portion of the mall effective 8:00pm on March 19, 2020. This effectively shuttered all businesses without an exterior entrance of their own. Some anchors with external entrances such as Target remained operational as they were considered an essential business. On July 10, 2020, the interior portion of the mall reopened with reduced hours as part of Governor Cuomo's Phase 4 economic reopening plan. This was allowed so long as certain conditions were met, such as the presence of enhanced air filtration technologies which could trap virus particles. The mall has continued to operate with reduced hours since reopening. On October 5, 2020, Cineworld announced it would close all Regal, Cineworld, and Picturehouse Cinemas locations in the US, UK, and Ireland indefinitely, beginning October 8. CEO Mooky Greidinger specifically cited that the continued reluctance of New York to allow cinemas to open was the main factor, as well as the lack of tentpole Hollywood films (referring to the delay of No Time to Die from November to April 2021 as being the \\"last straw\\") due to the high cost of operating a cinema without new releases. Mooky argued that the studios were holding off on new releases until New York cinemas reopen (accusing Governor Andrew Cuomo of being inflexible, despite having allowed other forms of indoor businesses to resume operations), and that the company only planned to reopen its cinemas once it is confident there is a \\"clear\\" and \\"solid\\" lineup of new releases.

Biography Marjanoviƒá was born into a large working-class family with 7 children in Knin, in the Littoral Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia). He had 4 brothers and 2 sisters. His father, Du≈°an, worked in the local factory, while mother Marija was a homemaker. After completing primary school and gymnasium in his hometown, Marjanoviƒá moved to Zagreb where he attended musical academy which he never finished. He then moved to Belgrade, where in 1960 he graduated at University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics, more specifically at the department for microeconomics. Upon graduation, Marjanoviƒá came back to Knin since he found employment there as the supervisor in Tvik factory. From there, he advanced to the position of financial director, and eventually moving on to metallurgical factory in Zenica. In 1973, he transferred to the Moscow outpost of Progres - a state company that handled close to 80% of Yugoslav black metallurgy and other heavy industries. By 1976 he quickly advanced up the ranks to become one of the directors at Progres. He handled company's steel division in Russia quite successfully while developing an impressive network of influential friends and business partners such as Viktor Chernomyrdin (later to become Prime Minister of Russia), and Yuri Brezhnev, son of Leonid Brezhnev. In 1979, Marjanoviƒá was named as Progres' general director. From 1989 until 1994, he was the president of FK Partizan's executive board. One of his more notable moves while at the post was bringing Predrag Mijatoviƒá to the club in December 1989. Mijatoviƒá, at the time a young promising player from Titograd's FK Buduƒánost, was very close to signing with Hajduk Split when Marjanoviƒá stepped in and convinced him to come to Belgrade. Upon leaving the club, Marjanoviƒá was named Partizan's honorary president. Political careerPrime Minister of Serbia 1994-1998= The building of the Serbian Government Marjanoviƒá officially commenced his PM term on 18 March 1994. He was widely regarded as little more than a puppet of then Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. =Prime Minister of Serbia 1998-2000= After early parliamentary elections in late 1997, Milo≈°eviƒá's SPS-led coalition (with Yugoslav Left and New Democracy) formed a government with far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj. Marjanoviƒá was picked for another PM term that started on March 24, 1998. Naturally, Marjanoviƒá continued as a mere extension of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá who at this time held the post of President of Yugoslavia. Here's how sources from the top levels of Milo≈°eviƒá's Socialist Party of Serbia described Marjanoviƒá's government modus operandi in Evropljanin magazine: Prime Minister Marjanoviƒá suggests something ‚Äì ministers do not vote ‚Äì and then Marjanoviƒá simply concludes the matter as agreed on. Of course Marjanoviƒá neither suggests nor concludes anything without first consulting Milo≈°eviƒá. (Evropljanin issue #13, 19 October 1998, p. 15) Even deputy PM Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj indirectly confirmed this operating procedure when he said the government meetings are always well prepared, never lasting longer than 15‚Äì20 minutes. (Srpska slobodarska misao, Vol. I 2000, issue #1, p. 142) This two- year period is widely seen as the most brutal whilst Serbia was led by Milo≈°eviƒá. Marjanoviƒá's government (with ≈†e≈°elj as its deputy PM), passed two of what critics consider to be the most draconian pieces of legislation in Serbian political history: the University Law that stripped the University of Belgrade of its autonomy, opening the way for the government to install professors, deans and rectors, as well as the Information Law, which aimed to restrict the activities of media financed by political enemies; despite this, the media played a prominent role in the 5 October 2000 coup d'√©tat. Similarly to his first term in office, Marjanoviƒá again took a back seat, leaving the limelight to more aggressive members of his cabinet like deputy PM ≈†e≈°elj and Minister of Information Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá. On 21 October 2000, two weeks after the Bulldozer Revolution, Marjanoviƒá resigned to be replaced by a transitional government composed of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) until new parliamentary elections could be organized. Business career while in office Marjanoviƒá continued to lead Progres all throughout his six and a half years as Serbian PM, though he claimed his status at the company was frozen. The company, which during the 1990s started importing gas from Russia (deal personally negotiated by Marjanoviƒá) was still officially publicly owned. Although allegations of wrongdoing ran rampant for years, Marjanoviƒá was never prosecuted. No legal action was taken against him after the new authorities took office following the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in October 2000. On 23 January 2002, Marjanoviƒá was re-elected as Progres' main board president. Death He died on 21 February 2006, in Belgrade, at age of 68, from undisclosed causes.

He is a two-time Atlantic 10 Player of the Year and went on to play in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor-league organization. Kingsbury was the first baseball player to earn back-to-back Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Awards, in 2001 and 2002. He went to school at Fordham where he set an NCAA record for stolen bases in a game (8), and was drafted by the Pirates in the 8th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but his excellent glove, a quick bat, an intelligent hitting approach, and his work ethic could have given him a third or fourth-round pick if he'd gone to a warm-weather college. During the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece, Kingsbury, who has a Greek grandmother, was given the chance to play for the host nation, Greece. Most of the players on the Greek baseball team were Americans with Greek heritage, including North Florida coach Dusty Rhodes, and White Sox scout John Kazanas, Clay Bellinger of the Orioles, outfielders Nick Markakis the Orioles and Nick Theodorou of the Dodgers, and catchers Mike Tonis of Royals and George Kottaras of the Padres. Kingsbury, an alumnus and 2008 Hall of Fame inductee of Fordham University and current member of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, picked up one of the biggest hits of the tournament for Greece, an RBI triple, in their lone win, which came against Italy in the preliminary round. In the spring of 2006, Kingsbury was invited to the Pirates major- league camp in Bradenton, FL as a non-roster invitee. During the seventh inning of the first game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Kingsbury dove for a ball in right field and upon hitting the ground dislocated his left throwing shoulder.

It is notable for being Terry Nation's first live action attempt to exercise his ownership of the Dalek concept independently of the BBC. As such, it does not include the character of the Doctor, the TARDIS or any other elements from the Doctor Who television series. Produced by John Gale and Ernest Hecht, and directed by Gillian Howell, it was performed mostly as a matin√©e indicating that children were the intended primary audience. Synopsis Following the crash landing of an Earth spacecraft on Skaro, one of the astronauts believes he can turn the Daleks into his servants. As ever, the Daleks have other plans. Background Freelance writers for the BBC were allowed to retain intellectual property rights over concepts and characters they introduced into individual serials. As a result, Terry Nation found himself co-owning the Dalek phenomenon of the mid-1960s. Nation was eager to find some way of divorcing them from the Doctor Who universe so that he could build a franchise which would not require BBC cooperation, and two such attempts were made in 1965. One was the Doctor and companionless episode Mission to the Unknown. Though commonly known as an introduction to the Doctor Who serial, The Daleks' Master Plan, it was also preparatory to a proposed Dalek-only pilot called The Destroyers. Had it been completed, The Destroyers would have been centred on the same \\"Space Security Service\\" seen in Mission to the Unknown and Master Plan. The play was the second attempt, which introduced the idea of the accidental human discovery of the planet Skaro (similar to the storyline of the TARDIS crew in The Daleks), and the humans' subsequent reaction against the Daleks. While this was the only one of the approaches to be produced on the strength of Terry Nation's ownership alone, it received no further independent development. Elements from this play were later reworked by David Whitaker for the Second Doctor television story The Power of the Daleks.

The reviewer concluded that: \\"After their false start, depending too much on weak jokes and technical jargon, a feeling of genuine crisis is generated. And the patience of the youthful matin√©e audience is rewarded as the Dalek menace increases. Despite the rather stilted dialogue, the actors play with all possible conviction, and Gillian Howell's direction has the necessary pace.\\" Audio adaptation In 2008 Big Finish Productions released The Curse of the Daleks as an audio drama, directed by Nicholas Briggs.

In the poetry of Macedonio, these three characters play a large role as important aspects of every person‚Äôs life. Text and translationCommentary Throughout the seven lined poem, Macedonio maintains a constant rhythm and beat by writing each verse, except for the third, with eleven syllables, taking into account synalephas. At the same time, Macedonio retains a soft, calm sound in his words with many uses of alliteration. In the listening to Cre√≠a yo being read out loud, it is obvious that this poem was written with euphony in mind. This style adds to the concept that Love, though subtle and delicate, is much stronger than Death. Another form of alliteration that is utilized can be found in the vocals of the poem as well. ‚ÄúMas poco Muerte puede, pues no puede‚Äù In this one verse alone, the sounds of ‚Äúm,‚Äù ‚Äúue,‚Äù and ‚Äúp‚Äù are used often.

It is considered America's oldest breed of chicken, probably descending from chickens brought to New England from southern England during colonial times. By the 19th century, they were widely popular and were raised in many parts of the country. Dominiques are a dual purpose breed, being valued for their meat as well as for their brown eggs. They weigh at maturity. In earlier times, their feathers were much sought after as stuffing for pillows and mattresses. History This breed was first documented in the Northeast United States around Boston, Massachusetts and other major hubs of development. After the Plymouth Rock breed was developed from the Dominiques in the 1870s, the Dominiques' popularity declined, until by 1950 they were so rare as to be considered nearly extinct. During the 1970s, Dominiques were listed in \\"Critical\\" status by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, with fewer than 500 breeding birds in North America. However, due to a revival of interest in them and other rare breeds, the Dominiques have made a comeback and are now listed on the \\"Watch\\" list, indicating lesser danger of extinction. Appearance A Dominique pullet (6 months old) An adult Dominique's head Dominiques are quite distinctive in appearance. They have a rose comb and a heavy plumage of irregularly striped dark grey and light grey feathers (a pattern called \\"barring\\" or sometimes \\"hawk coloring\\"). This dark/light grey striping is often mistaken for black and white striping. The breed matures quickly, producing eggs at about six months of age. At first glance, Dominiques and Barred Rocks appear strikingly similar, often leading to confusion when discerning a particular breed. The strongest indicators are the comb, plumage, and color. Comb  Dominiques possess a rose comb while Barred Rocks possess a single comb. This is generally the most obvious difference. Plumage  Dominiques exhibit staggered barring in their plumage, lending to a somewhat mottled appearance. Barred Rocks exhibit crisp, parallel barring. Color  Dominiques exhibit a softer contrast of \\"not quite black on not quite white\\", while Barred Rocks exhibit a high-contrast black-on-white color. Disposition and behavior Dominique hens tend to be calm, personable birds (a desirable trait in an egg production bird). Their calm, steady demeanor makes them successful as show birds or family pets. However, Dominique roosters can sometimes be even more aggressive than the Rhode Island Red and have been known to kill small cats, snakes, and even mink. The hens tend to be good mothers, brooding and raising chicks with a high rate of success. The Dominique is hardy and a good forager, traits which are attributed to the harsh conditions in which the breed first developed.

Earl of Bellomont, in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came on 9 December 1680 when Charles Kirkhoven, 1st Baron Wotton, was made Earl of Bellomont. He had already been created Baron Wotton, of Wotton in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England on 31 August 1650. He was childless and both titles became extinct on his death in 1683. The second creation came on 2 November 1689 Richard Coote, 2nd Baron Coote, later Governor of New York, was made Earl of Bellomont. He was the son of Richard Coote, who had been created Lord Coote, Baron of Coloony, in the County of Sligo, in the Peerage of Ireland on 6 September 1660. Lord Coote was a younger son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and the younger brother of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath (see Coote baronets for more information on this branch of the family). Lord Bellomont was succeeded by his elder son, Nanfan, the second Earl, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the third Earl. The earldom became extinct when the latter died without surviving male issue in 1766. The late Earl was succeeded in the barony of Coote by his first cousin once removed, Charles Coote, who became the fifth Baron. Charles was the son of Charles Coote (1695‚Äì1750), Member of Parliament for County Cavan, son of the Honourable Thomas Coote, a Justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), younger son of the first Baron. On 4 September 1767 the earldom of Bellomont was created for the third time when Charles was made Earl of Bellomont (although the title was probably erroneously spelled \\"Bellamont\\" in the letters patent). On 18 May 1774 Lord Bellomont was created a Baronet, of Donnybrooke in the County of Dublin, in the Baronetage of Ireland, with remainder to his illegitimate son Charles Coote. On his death in 1800 the barony and earldom became extinct as he left no surviving legitimate male issue. He was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his illegitimate son, Charles, the second Baronet (see Coote baronets for further history of this title).

It was the first Australian legislation to deal with such issues. It enables the listing of threatened species and communities and threats to native species, and the declaration of critical habitat necessary for the survival of native plants and animals. After an extensive review of the Act in 2019, the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Amendment Act 2019 modernised and strengthened the provisions of the Act on 1 June 2020. Enforcement of the FFG Act is overseen by the Office of the Conservation Regulator (OCR). Description The Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 helps to protect and manage the biodiversity of the state of Victoria. It aims to conserve all of Victoria‚Äôs native plants and animals. In order to achieve this, the Act enables a number of mechanisms, such as listing threatened species, communities and threats to native species; the establishment of a statewide biodiversity management strategy; declaring certain areas as critical habitat; requiring public authorities to take the Act into account in their operations; and requiring permits for certain activities which may affect native plants and animals.  Criticisms  Lawyers for Forests (LFF) published a review of the act in 2002, and found a lack of resources to enforce the act, a lack of government transparency and accountability, that the act may be and is ignored in government decisionmaking, and that the act is generally unenforceable. The review identified the following factors: * Lack of political will for the implementation of the FFG Act. * Lack of funding and resources to allow the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) to effectively implement the Act. * Objectives of the FFG Act being overridden by objectives and interests of bodies with conflicting agendas, such as the forestry industry. As well as a general review, the review considers the impact of the Act on the Leadbeater's possum, the powerful owl and the tiger quoll, as well as on a threatened community and a threatening process. For example, it considers the concern of environmentalists for the small and poorly placed Special Protection and Management Zones for the tiger quoll, the continuing clear-fell logging followed by slash burns in their management zones, and the failure to stop the use of 1080 poison, which is a threat to the species. LFF recommended that the NRE should receive appropriate funding to fully implement the FFG Act, and the government commit to NRE fulfilling its obligations under the Act. The group further recommended that the Act should be enforceable, and NRE should be accountable in its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Act. Other environmental groups have echoed the review; for example, the \\"delays or lack of implementation of key documents required under the FFG Act\\" was noted by the Victorian Rainforest Network in 2003. 2019 review and amendment A major review was undertaken in 2019, resulting in the enactment of the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Amendment Act 2019, by which amendments to the FFG Act took effect from 1 June 2020. The amendments modernised and strengthened some of the provisions of the Act, such as action preventing species from becoming threatened; adopting the Common Assessment Method, consistent with the national method for assessment and listing of threatened species (as per the EPBC Act}); setting up a reporting requirement on the implementation of the statewide Biodiversity Strategy. It also improved powers for enforcement and increased penalties for breaches of the legislation. Other significant reforms included the introduction of a set of principles to guide decision making (including consultation with traditional owners and the public); a new definition of \\"critical habitat\\" to replace the previous one which was too hard to prove and thus implement; the introduction of habitat conservation orders; setting up a new register; and an obligation for the Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability to report on achievement of targets in the Biodiversity Strategy every five years. Enforcement of the FFG ACT would now be overseen by the Office of the Conservation Regulator (OCR), established in 2019.

Members are selected through a selective process called bicker. Sometimes known as \\"the Illustrious Cap and Gown Club,\\" it was the first of the currently selective eating clubs to accept women.

History Cap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to stay in the same geographic location for its entire existence.Princeton University: An Interactive Campus History, 1746‚Äì1996 Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today. A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011. Notable Cap and Gown alumni include Dean Cain '88, Brooke Shields '87, and Donald Rumsfeld '54.

By Michigan law, the Proposal became law on December 22, 2006. MCRI was a citizen initiative aimed at stopping discrimination based on race, color, sex, or religion in admission to colleges, jobs, and other publicly funded institutions ‚Äì effectively prohibiting affirmative action by public institutions based on those factors. The Proposal's constitutionality was challenged in federal court, but its constitutionality was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. Summary of Court Challenges On 21 March 2008, Judge David M. Lawson of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed a case filed by plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of Proposal 2. Judge Lawson held that Proposal 2 does not violate the United States Constitution. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned MCRI on July 1, 2011. Judges R. Guy Cole Jr. and Martha Craig Daughtrey said that \\"Proposal 2 reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.\\" Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said he would appeal the court ruling. Bill Schuette, Attorney General for the State of Michigan announced his appeal of the Sixth Circuit's decision on July 28, 2011. The MCRI stood in effect until this appeal was complete. On November 16, 2012, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, upheld the earlier ruling that the MCRI was unconstitutional. Schuette then announced his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action on March 25, 2013. The Court heard arguments in the case on October 15, 2013, and the Court ruled on April 22, 2014 \\"that there is no authority ... for the judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school decisions.\\" Thereby upholding the Constitutionality of the amendment. Text of the Amendment The ballot initiative amended the Michigan Constitution to include a new section (Section 26 of Article I): Background The subject of the proposal has been hotly debated, with the very definition of what it encompasses at the center of the controversy. Proponents argue that it bans programs in public hiring, public employment, and public education that \\"give preferential treatment to\\" or \\"discriminate against\\" individuals on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, or national origin. Opponents argue that Proposal 2 bans all affirmative action programs in the operation of public employment, education, or contracting. Proponents cite the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the \\"Equal Protection\\" clause of the 14th Amendment that forbids the United States or any state from denying \\"equal protection of the law\\" to any citizen as models for the proposal. It is a near copy of similar initiatives passed in California (Proposition 209) and Washington (Initiative 200). In 2004, When the first attempt was made to place the measure on the ballot, Gregory Creswell was MCRI spokesperson, volunteer coordinator, and an organizer.The program begins at 3:38 . A promotional video plays first. The segment devoted to Gregory Creswell starts at 20:03 * In a pre-kick-off announcement, he articulated some reasons he was working for the amendment: \\"I believe it is wrong for the government and politicians to dictate to an employer who they must or must not hire, just as I believe Jim Crow is immoral and just as I believe apartheid in South Africa was immoral,\\" said Creswell. * This reference includes a link to search results of the Archives of the Detroit News.

During the early debate about the proposal shortly following the collection of signatures (508,282 submitted January 6, 2005), the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, a governmental body charged with investigating civil rights violations in the state of Michigan, concluded an investigation of MCRI and asserted that supporters of the MCRI had committed widespread and systematic racially targeted fraud in their petition campaign to secure ballot access.Bernstein, Mark.

The hypertext title \\"Michigan Civil Rights Commission's Findings of MCRI Fraud\\" on this page links to the document here: First federal lawsuit against MCRI Oral arguments in a federal lawsuit charging MCRI and the State of Michigan with violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were heard on August 17, 2006 with attorneys presenting their closing arguments on the morning of August 18, 2006. The case was heard by U.S. District Court Judge Arthur Tarnow, who promised to rule on the matter by September 8, 2006, to give officials enough time to print up the ballot. During the first day of the hearing, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the courthouse chanting among other things, \\"Racist fraud, hell no! MCRI has got to go!\\" The lawsuit was filed by Operation King's Dream, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, Detroit City Council, American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee, Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, Keep the Vote No Takeover, AFSCME Locals 207, 312, and 2920, and UAW 2200 as well as several individual voters. Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm submitted an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs. On August 29, 2006, the case was decided with Judge Tarnow, a Democratic judicial appointee, refusing to remove the initiative from the ballot. However, Judge Tarnow declared that \\"MCRI engaged in systematic voter fraud by telling voters that were signing a petition supporting affirmative action.\\" However, because the case was not decided on these grounds, this statement is legally characterized as \\"dicta\\"‚Äîjudicial commentary that is not relevant to the outcome of a case. Tarnow also found the testimony of Jennifer Gratz (MCRI's executive director) in the court to be evasive and misleading. His stated reason for refusing an injunction to remove the MCRI from the ballot was the MCRI \\"targeted all Michigan voters for deception without regard to race.\\" He ruled that the Voting Rights Act was not violated because it \\"is not a general anti-voter fraud statute, but rather prohibits practices which result in unequal access to the political process because of race.\\" Luke Massie, national co-chair of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights & Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) announced that the plaintiffs would appeal Tarnow's decision to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, saying \\"It makes no sense to conclude there was fraud and allow the vote to go forward.\\" The 6th Circuit rejected the appeal in mid-September. Voting and Poll Results On November 27, 2006, Proposal 2 was certified officially by the Michigan Secretary of State to have passed by a margin of 58% to 42% (2,141,010 \\"Yes\\" votes to 1,555,691 \\"No\\" votes).Land, Terri Lynn.Election Results ‚Äì General Election ‚Äì November 07, 2006, State Proposal-06-2: Constitutional Amendment: Ban Affirmative Action Programs . \\"michigan.gov\\" (website). The last reported poll of October 15, by The Detroit News, showed MCRI to have up to a 50‚Äì41% lead. In another Free Press‚ÄîLocal 4 Michigan poll conducted by Selzer & Co. Inc. of Des Moines between October 8 to October 11 of 643 likely voters, it was shown that 41% were in favor of the MCRI, while 44% opposed the measure, and 15% of the voter poll were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 3.9% making the poll a statistical dead- heat. Another poll, from mid-September 2006, showed MCRI was up 48‚Äì37 with 15% undecided, with the pollster admitting that his previous polls had not used the exact language of the proposal until the Sept. poll. The entire polling process highlighted an ongoing debate about the scientific value of modern phone polling on questions of race or controversial social issues where the polled members of the public may be \\"embarrassed\\" by social desirability bias to give a truthful response about their intended vote for fear that the interviewer will judge them. Board of Canvassers Meeting In July 2005, the Michigan State Board of Canvassers declined to certify the MCRI proposal for Michigan's November 2006 ballot after hearing allegations that a significant number of signatures were obtained by telling supporters of affirmative action that the petition was likewise, in support of affirmative action. Counter- allegations were made by MCRI supporters that the allegations were fabricated and that the Board of Canvassers' decision-process itself was being improperly influenced by politics because Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Mark Brewer was \\"giving orders\\" to the two Democrat-appointed members of the Board, and backed up by the linked videotape shot by MCRI Treasurer and publisher Chetly Zarko. Despite the deadlocked vote by the Canvassers and their inability to certify the petition as a result, in October of the same year the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered the board to certify the petitions. On December 14, 2005, in Lansing, Michigan, while attempting to comply with that court order to certify the petitions, the board's four members were scheduled to make the final vote to certify the petitions for the November ballot. However, the meeting attended by hundreds of Detroit high school students. The crowd began to shout \\"No voter fraud,\\" until they became so loud that the members left the room adjourning until 2pm. Chanting, \\"They say Jim Crow! We say hell no!,\\" the emotion-surged crowd of students continued until a table was overturned in the commotion and the Lansing police came in to control the situation. Opponents of MCRI labeled their own conduct \\"civil disobedience\\" while proponents argued it crossed the line into outright violence and intentional intimidation.The article requested can not be found!

After the protest, the election panel again failed to certify the petitions with a vote of 2‚Äì1, falling short of the required three votes. Republican board members Katherine Degrow and Lyn Banks voted in favor with Democrats Paul Mitchell voting no and Doyle O'Connor not voting. The meeting received considerable media attention because of the protest. In the months following the controversial board meeting, Mitchell resigned from the board and O'Connor was charged with contempt of court; however the charges were dismissed after O'Connor sought disclosure of improper communications between the chief judge and the Republican leadership of the Legislature.Lansing State Journal: The article requested can not be found!

(A3,20060404,NEWS01,604040325,AR) O'Connor later testified against the MCRI at the August 17 federal court hearing, relaying how he had witnessed two African-American women circulating the anti-affirmative action petition in Detroit telling signers that it was in support of affirmative action. \\"Preferential Treatment\\" Proponents of the MCRI claim that the initiative will make illegal only those programs and policies, affecting university admissions, public employment, and contracting, that grant \\"preferential treatment\\" based on gender, race, or ethnicity. These claims were disputed by some opponents who cite California's Proposition 209, alleging that the language of that proposal outlawed \\"all affirmative action policies\\" and programs, and MCRI's language is nearly identical. Proponents counter this argument by arguing that while MCRI is nearly identical to California's amendment, neither MCRI or 209 outlawed \\"all\\" or any \\"affirmative action.\\" They point to programs such as California's use of socio-economic indicators, outreach targeted at the 150 lowest scoring high schools, and traditional anti-discrimination enforcement as some among many race-neutral types of \\"affirmative action\\". On March 7, 2007, however, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, which had previously fought against Proposal 2, issued a report at the behest of the Governor, taking the position that Proposal 2 did not eliminate \\"all\\" affirmative action. In their summary of a 63-page report, Linda Parker, chair of the Commission, now agreed with Proposal 2 advocates, \\"With this Report, the Commission and Department confirm that Proposal 2 does not mean the end of equal opportunity or diversity in Michigan,\\".Commission Report The Report explicitly cites the difference between \\"preferential treatment\\" and \\"affirmative action\\". Proponent of Proposal 2, Chetly Zarko, argued that this \\"flip-flop\\" Panel: Most programs are legal‚ÄîState by the Commission not only proved MCRI was correct all along about the legal issues and difference, but that it disproved the Commission's report alleging \\"fraud\\" in signature-collection since the Commission had previously alleged in its June 2006 fraud-allegation report that petitioners should have used the words \\"affirmative action\\" in their presentation.. Post Election Several groups have challenged the constitutional amendment since its passage. On November 8, 2006, BAMN called a press conference announcing that they had launched a second lawsuit against Proposal 2 in conjunction with United for Equality and Affirmative Action and Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, claiming that it violates both the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment as affirmed by the Supreme Court decision, Grutter v. Bollinger. That same day, about 2,000 students gathered on the diag at the University of Michigan where University President Mary Sue Coleman gave a speech in which she promised U-M would go to court to defend its efforts to promote diversity, even though the people of Michigan had voted against affirmative action. Two weeks later, on November 21, Grand Rapids Mayor George Heartwell said he was considering having the city file a federal lawsuit to overturn Proposal 2. On December 19, U.S. District Court Judge David Lawson ruled that the state's three largest public universities‚Äîthe University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University‚Äîcould delay implementation of Proposal until July 1, 2007.Court allows U-M, MSU, Wayne State to complete this year's admissions and aid cycle under current rules The universities had filed a lawsuit seeking the delay, charging fairness in admissions, in response to BAMN's lawsuit in which all three universities were named as defendants. The Center for Individual Rights has asked the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Judge Lawson's ruling and force the universities to adhere to the ban on affirmative action immediately.Detnews.com  This article is no longer available online On December 29, a 3-judge panel of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals lifted Judge Lawson's injunction granting the 3 universities the July 1 implementation delay and ordered them to implement Proposal 2 immediately.

Another lawsuit has been filed in federal court by the NAACP and the ACLU to block the ban on affirmative action. On January 4, 2007, the Center for Individual Rights filed a lawsuit in Washtenaw Circuit Court, asking a judge to order the University of Michigan to immediately comply with Proposal 2, and abandon their affirmative action programs.Detnews.com  This article is no longer available online The case was resolved on January 29 when Eric Russell, whom the Center for Individual Rights was representing voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit.The article requested can not be found!

(C4,20070131,NEWS06,701310303,AR) Jan. 9‚Äì10: BAMN held a press conference at Cass Tech High School in Detroit announcing that their appeal of the Federal Appeals Court decision overturning the delay of the ban on affirmative action. The next day, after placing holds on admissions, the University of Michigan announced that they will comply with the ban on affirmative action. Hours later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens responded to BAMN's appeal of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision overturning the delay of Proposal 2's implementation and ordered all briefs due by January 17. U-M, Wayne State, MSU, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm all filed briefs in support. Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox urged Stevens to deny the injunction. On January 19, the Supreme Court denied BAMN's appeal without comment. On Thursday, February 15, BAMN submitted 2,000 petitions to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan demanding that there be no drop in minority enrollment. The following Tuesday, on February 20, the Michigan Student Assembly, the elected student government of U-M passed a resolution demanding that there be no drop in underrepresented minority student enrollment. On Friday, July 1, 2011, the Federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held the amendment unconstitutional on the grounds that it \\"reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests,\\" and thus violates the 14th Amendment. Attorney General Bill Schuette then announced that he would appeal the ruling and ask to have the case re-heard \\"en banc,\\" by all active judges rather than a panel of three. On Thursday, November 3, 2011, the Equal Justice Society and more than a dozen other organizations announced that they had filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, urging the court to strike down Michigan's Proposal 2 as unconstitutional. The brief authors argue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution by creating procedural barriers for people of color. On 16 November 2012, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc upheld the earlier ruling that the Initiative is unconstitutional. Supporters announced their intention to appeal to the Supreme Court. On March 25, 2013 the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari, agreeing to hear the case. Arguments were heard during the Supreme Court term beginning in October 2013.https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/13grantednotedlist.pdf On April 22, 2014 the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative as Constitutional.  Effects  On Friday, February 16, 2007, the University of Michigan released admissions data showing that, in a period that includes the time after Proposal 2 was implemented, minority admissions of primarily lower test scores declined 25% from the same period a year before. The data also show that in the period immediately before Proposal 2 was implemented, minority admissions was up 55% from the same period in 2006. A spokeswoman for the university, Julie Peterson, has said that since the numbers aren't final and since so many minority students applied early, the drop cannot necessarily be attributed to the amendment itself.

It is located in the Cape Peninsula, near Simon's Town towards Cape Point, near Cape Town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is also commonly known as Boulders Bay. It is a popular tourist spot because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. Boulders Beach forms part of the Table Mountain National Park. These African penguins are only found on the coastlines of Southern Africa - (South Africa & Namibia). These penguins are currently on the verge of extinction. As a result, the penguins are under the protection of the Cape Nature Conservation. Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird (Spheniscus demersus) can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. This is partly due to the reduction in commercial pelagic trawling in False Bay, which has increased the supply of pilchards and anchovy, which form part of the penguins' diet.http://www.sanparks.co.za/parks/table_mountain/tourism/attractions.php Bordered mainly by indigenous bush above the high-water mark on the one side, and the clear water of False Bay on the other, the area comprises a number of small sheltered bays, partially enclosed by granite boulders that are 540 million years old. The most popular recreational spot is Boulders Beach, but the penguins are best viewed from Foxy Beach, where newly constructed boardwalks take visitors to within a few meters of the birds. It is also a popular swimming beach, although people are restricted to beaches adjacent to the penguin colony.

Baker had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of colonel but resigned following his election as lieutenant governor, during which time he played an important role in overseeing the formation and training of states levies. He served as acting- governor for five months during the illness of Governor Oliver Morton, and was elevated to Governor following Morton's resignation from office. During Baker's full term as governor, he focused primitively on the creation and improvement of institutions to help veterans and their families that had been disaffected by the war. He also championed the post-war federal constitutional amendments, and was able to successfully advocate their acceptance. Early life=Family and background Conrad Baker was born in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, on February 12, 1817, the son of Conrad Baker, a Presbyterian minister, and Mary Winternheimer Baker. He worked on the family farm until age fifteen and attended common school. He then enrolled in Pennsylvania College in Gettysburg where he studied law, but quit before graduating. He continued to study law in the office of Thaddeus Stevens. He met Matilda Escon Sommers and the couple married in 1838. They had two children. Baker was admitted to the bar in 1839 and opened his own office in Gettysburg.Gugin, p. 152 Early political career Bakers closed his practice in 1841, and moved his family west to settle in Evansville, Indiana. He opened a new law office there, and took an interest in the city's civics. In 1845 he ran as the Whig candidate for representative of Vanderburgh County in the Indiana House of Representatives. He served one one-year term before returning to his practice. He was elected to serve on a county court in 1852 but resigned in 1854. His brother, William Baker, had also become active in the local politics, and served four terms as major of Evansville during the same time period.Gugin, p. 153 Baker was outspokenly anti-slavery, and following the break-up of the Whig party, he joined the newly formed Republican Party in 1854. At the state convention in 1856, he was nominated to run as lieutenant governor on the ticket with Oliver Morton a governor. The election was one of the most divisive in state history, with both sides making scathing attacks on the other. Despite the party's merger with several other third parties, the Republicans lost the election and Baker returned to his law practice in Evansville. American Civil War Baker's wife, Matilda died in 1855, and Baker remarried in 1858 to Charlotte Frances Chute. The couple had two daughters and one son. He was in Evansville when the American Civil War began, and was part of a large crowd that gathered to discuss the event. He took the podium and delivered a speech calling on the crowd to take an oath of allegiance to the Union, which was administered by his brother, the Mayor. He then called on all the able-bodied men to follow him to war. Baker and his brother began actively recruiting a full regiment of men to serve in the war, and he was promoted to serve as Colonel of the 1st Regiment Indiana Cavalry.Gugin, p. 154 Baker led his regiment in defensive and garrison duty across the western theater of the war, and remained in regular communication with Governor Oliver Morton, who has become governor a few months earlier. Baker was most involved in coordinating supplies, and became a valuable organizer. Morton soon promoted him to serve as provost marshal of the state, and ordered him to return to Indianapolis to oversee operations. There he oversaw the formation of dozens of state regiments, tens of thousand of men, the shipment of tons of supplies, the distributions of weapons, and the management of the state arsenal. Governor James Forbes Acting Baker left the army in 1864 to run again as Lieutenant Governor on the ticket with Oliver Morton and was elected with a 20,000-vote majority. Morton took a period of poor health in 1865 after suffering a paralytic stroke. He continued his duties briefly, but decided to attempt to seek a cure to the paralysis. He left the state and left Baker to serve as acting governor for five months until his health recovered. When Morton was elected to the Senate in 1866, Baker succeeded him as governor. While completing Morton's term, he began to advocate school reform. His primary goal was to improve the quality of teachers, which he sought to do by creating incentives to encourage teachers to consider their job as a permanent career. At that time, teaching was considered a temporary position by most teachers, until they could find a superior job elsewhere. The General Assembly accepted his plan and passed legislation to enact it. Second term In 1868, Baker was reelected to the position of governor, defeating Thomas Hendricks by 961 votes, the closest in state history. During his administration, a women's prison was built, and a soldiers' home to assist the returning veterans and the Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute were constructed. Other school institutions were built during his term using federal funding provided by the land-grant system. Along with private donations, the money was used to start Purdue University. Baker signed the law to create the school in 1869, and it opened just after his term ended.Gugin, p. 155 Another of Baker's acts as governor was to establish the governor's portrait collection. The assembly agreed to spend up to $200 per portrait for the creation of the collection. Baker then hired painters and sought out the families of the former governors to procure photos and paintings from which official portraits could be created.Gugin, p. 158 Baker's most difficult goal to achieve was the ratification of the post-war amendments that, among other things, banned slavery and granted blacks the right to vote. His advocacy on the issues though managed to secure each of their ratifications, with the fourteenth amendment being the last ratified in 1869. The Democrats had resigned office en masse when the bill was put up for a vote to deny quorum, but the Republicans went ahead to approve the amendment. When the Democrats took the legislature in the following election, they revoked the ratification of the amendments, but it was too late and the federal government, which was Republican-dominated at the time, had already added them to the constitution.Gugin, p. 156 Baker also advocated for African American rights through additional school reform. In 1869 he signed legislation which addressed an 1865 school law which prevented the establishment of public schools for non-white children. The new law extended current public school funding to establish schools for African Americans and repealed all laws inconsistent herewith. Death and legacy After Baker's term as governor expired he retired from public office and reopened his law office. His new partner was his former political opponent, Thomas Hendricks. After Hendricks was elected governor in 1872, Baker took on state attorney general Oscar B. Hord and Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court Samuel Perkins as partners. The law firm was passed on to Baker's son, and has since become one of the leading law firms in the United States, Baker & Daniels LLP. Baker remained active in public affairs and urged the state schools to grant equal opportunities. He became fairly active in the woman's suffrage movement and delivered an address to one of their meetings. He died on April 28, 1885, and was buried in Evansville, Indiana.Sobel, Robert, and John Raimo, eds.

When stress is applied that causes densification due to water (or other liquid) being displaced from between the soil grains, then consolidation, not compaction, has occurred. Normally, compaction is the result of heavy machinery compressing the soil, but it can also occur due to the passage of, for example, animal feet. In soil science and agronomy, soil compaction is usually a combination of both engineering compaction and consolidation, so may occur due to a lack of water in the soil, the applied stress being internal suction due to water evaporationSoil compaction due to lack of water in soil as well as due to passage of animal feet. Affected soils become less able to absorb rainfall, thus increasing runoff and erosion. Plants have difficulty in compacted soil because the mineral grains are pressed together, leaving little space for air and water, which are essential for root growth. Burrowing animals also find it a hostile environment, because the denser soil is more difficult to penetrate. The ability of a soil to recover from this type of compaction depends on climate, mineralogy and fauna. Soils with high shrink-swell capacity, such as vertisols, recover quickly from compaction where moisture conditions are variable (dry spells shrink the soil, causing it to crack). But clays such as kaolinite, which do not crack as they dry, cannot recover from compaction on their own unless they host ground- dwelling animals such as earthworms ‚Äî the Cecil soil series is an example. Before soils can be compacted in the field, some laboratory tests are required to determine their engineering properties. Among various properties, the maximum dry density and the optimum moisture content are vital and specify the required density to be compacted in the field. crawler-backhoe is here equipped with a narrow sheepsfoot roller to compact the fill over newly placed sewer pipe, forming a stable support for a new road surface.

Wacker Neuson vibratory rammer BS 60-2i in action. In construction Soil compaction is a vital part of the construction process. It is used for support of structural entities such as building foundations, roadways, walkways, and earth retaining structures to name a few. For a given soil type certain properties may deem it more or less desirable to perform adequately for a particular circumstance. In general, the preselected soil should have adequate strength, be relatively incompressible so that future settlement is not significant, be stable against volume change as water content or other factors vary, be durable and safe against deterioration, and possess proper permeability. When an area is to be filled or backfilled the soil is placed in layers called lifts. The ability of the first fill layers to be properly compacted will depend on the condition of the natural material being covered. If unsuitable material is left in place and backfilled, it may compress over a long period under the weight of the earth fill, causing settlement cracks in the fill or in any structure supported by the fill. In order to determine if the natural soil will support the first fill layers, an area can be proofrolled. Proofrolling consists of utilizing a piece of heavy construction equipment to roll across the fill site and watching for deflections to be revealed. These areas will be indicated by the development of rutting, pumping, or ground weaving. To ensure adequate soil compaction is achieved, project specifications will indicate the required soil density or degree of compaction that must be achieved. These specifications are generally recommended by a geotechnical engineer in a geotechnical engineering report. The soil type - that is, grain-size distributions, shape of the soil grains, specific gravity of soil solids, and amount and type of clay minerals, present - has a great influence on the maximum dry unit weight and optimum moisture content. It also has a great influence on how the materials should be compacted in given situations. Compaction is accomplished by use of heavy equipment. In sands and gravels, the equipment usually vibrates, to cause re- orientation of the soil particles into a denser configuration. In silts and clays, a sheepsfoot roller is frequently used, to create small zones of intense shearing, which drives air out of the soil. Determination of adequate compaction is done by determining the in-situ density of the soil and comparing it to the maximum density determined by a laboratory test. The most commonly used laboratory test is called the Proctor compaction test and there are two different methods in obtaining the maximum density. They are the standard Proctor and modified Proctor tests; the modified Proctor is more commonly used. For small dams, the standard Proctor may still be the reference. While soil under structures and pavements needs to be compacted, it is important after construction to decompact areas to be landscaped so that vegetation can grow. Compaction methods There are several means of achieving compaction of a material. Some are more appropriate for soil compaction than others, while some techniques are only suitable for particular soils or soils in particular conditions. Some are more suited to compaction of non-soil materials such as asphalt. Generally, those that can apply significant amounts of shear as well as compressive stress, are most effective. The available techniques can be classified as: # Static - a large stress is slowly applied to the soil and then released. # Impact - the stress is applied by dropping a large mass onto the surface of the soil. # Vibrating - a stress is applied repeatedly and rapidly via a mechanically driven plate or hammer. Often combined with rolling compaction (see below). # Gyrating - a static stress is applied and maintained in one direction while the soil is a subjected to a gyratory motion about the axis of static loading. Limited to laboratory applications. # Rolling - a heavy cylinder is rolled over the surface of the soil. Commonly used on sports pitches. Roller-compactors are often fitted with vibratory devices to enhance their effectiveness. # Kneading - shear is applied by alternating movement in adjacent positions. An example, combined with rolling compaction, is the 'sheepsfoot' roller used in waste compaction at landfills. The construction plant available to achieve compaction is extremely varied and is described elsewhere. Test methods in laboratory Soil compactors are used to perform test methods which cover laboratory compaction methods used to determine the relationship between molding water content and dry unit weight of soils. Soil placed as engineering fill is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as, shear strength, compressibility, or permeability. In addition, foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties. Laboratory compaction tests provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties, and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved. Test methods such as EN 13286-2, EN 13286-47, ASTM D698, ASTM D1557, AASHTO T99, AASHTO T180, AASHTO T193, BS 1377:4 provide soil compaction testing procedures.

Landstinget had powers equal to the Folketing, which made the two houses of parliament hard to distinguish. Originally, membership and the electorate was restricted, and the members were largely conservatives. Membership of the house was then restricted to certain sectors of society: only males with a certain net worth could hold a seat. In 1915, these restrictions were removed, and a few new members were appointed by the existing members. Etymology and earlier use The former Landsting chamber in Christiansborg Palace in 2018. Ting (old Norse: √æing) means assembly. It first came into being during Viking times and was formed by the freemen of the community, and it generally numbered about a hundred men. Tings were necessary in the clan-based society of Northern Germany and Scandinavia, because they allowed for inter-clan wars to be resolved or prevented through the mediation of the ting. It also served as the place for religious rites and trade negotiations. Landstinget is also the Danish name for the modern Parliament of Greenland. History The Danish Court of Impeachment, Rigsretten, during a session in the Landsting Chamber, Christiansborg Palace, 1877. Under the Constitution of 1849, the requirements for the right to vote was the same for the two houses, however the requirements for electability were stricter for Landstinget; candidates were limited to those of age 40 and above and they were required to have a substantial income. The house originally had 51 members, all elected indirectly. The voters elected a group of electors for each constituency, and the electors elected the members of the house. The members were elected for a term of eight years; however, terms were staggered so that half of the seats were up for election every four years. With the Constitution of 1866, the electoral system was reformed. The number of seats was increased to 66 of which twelve were appointed by the king for a period of twelve years, and one by the Faroese L√∏gting. The remaining 53 were elected indirectly. In Copenhagen, half the electors were elected by the voters paying the largest amount of tax, and the other half by all the voters. In the rest of the country, one elector was elected by the voters in each parish in the countryside and half as many electors were elected in the market towns by the same system as in Copenhagen. Then for each elector elected in the parishes and the market towns, one elector was found among those that paid the greatest amount of tax in the parishes. As the main direct tax of the time was based on real estate and its value as farmland, this system greatly favored manor owners. The result was a conservative majority lasting 35 years, until the 1902 election. The next reform of the electoral system came with the Constitution of 1915, and the first election under this system was the 1918 election. Women were given the right to vote, the number of seats was increased to 72, the number of constituencies was reduced to seven, and the system of royally appointed members was replaced by 18 members elected by the resigning Landsting for a period of eight years.Engelstoft, p. 278. Although a 1939 referendum that would have replaced Landstinget with another chamber‚Äîthe Rigsting‚Äîand simplified the legislative process, failed due to a low voter turnout, the bicameral system and thereby Landstinget was abolished when the current constitution was approved in a 1953 referendum.

During his term he led relief efforts during and after the Great Flood of 1937. Early life Maurice Clifford Townsend, known as Clifford to his friends and family, was born on a farm in Blackford County, Indiana to David and Lydia Glancy Townsend on August 11, 1884. He had one sister, Myrtle, and the two were raised on a country farm. After completing high school in 1901 he worked as a teamster in the oil fields during the Indiana Gas Boom, and later in a factory. In 1907 he entered Marion College in Grant County. After working as a teacher for six years to pay for his education, he graduated in 1907. He then taught in the common schools, and served as school superintendent for different counties between 1909 and 1919.Gugin, p. 300 He entered politics as a representative in the Indiana House in 1923. His single term in the legislature was focused mostly on reforming the state's tax code, an issue he worked on up through his term as governor. In 1928 he ran an unsuccessful campaign for Congress, but was defeated. He then returned to education, serving again as a school superintendent and on the executive committee of the Indiana's Teachers Association in 1929. Townsend's experience in education made Paul V. McNutt consider him as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor and helped him to win the nomination at the state's Democratic convention in 1932.Gugin, p. 301 He was elected the 33rd Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket and served from 1933 until 1937. The position of Lieutenant Governor was dramatically altered during his term. Previously, the position received only a token salary, only required active work during legislative sessions, which amounted to sixty days every two years. The position was granted significantly more power after the passage of the 1932 Executive Reorganization Act when the position was made head of the state's agricultural department and assigning him other administrative duties. The change put a large number of patronage jobs under his control. Governor Townsend's mother placed his name in nomination for governor at the 1936 Democratic state convention. His nomination though, was a tough battle. The Democratic Party was split between three strong faction, with McNutt supporting Townsend, powerful senator Sherman Minton supporting Pleas Greenlee, and the chairman of the state party supporting Kirk McKinney. The fight at the convention was bitter, and a fist fight broke out before the final vote took place. In the end McNutt's control over the party machine determine the nomination in favor of Townsend.Gugin, p. 302 The popular McNutt campaigned heavily on Townsend's behalf in the general election. Republicans again made gains in the General Assembly, but Democrat kept the majority and Townsend won the election, defeating Republican Raymond Springer by over 180,000 votes.Gugin, p. 303 Townsend was inaugurated January 11, 1937. The state was immediately beset with a disaster as the Great Flood of 1937 began. Within a week, every community on the Ohio River was destroyed and hundreds of thousands were homeless. In the early stages, he coordinated evacuation efforts, routing all available trains to carry people to safety as flood waters rose. Thousand of relief workers and the national guard were called out to help rebuild. The disaster remains the second worse to have ever hit the state. Indiana was the only state affected by the flood, and there were no drownings reported. Harry L. Hopkins of the National Relief Administration said, \\"No state was better managed during the flood than Indiana.\\" Before the flood relief was completed, a large strike broke out in General Motors factories across the state. Violence broke out in Anderson and the National Guard was called out by Townsend to restore order and protect the factory. The strike prompted Townsend to request the creation of the state Division of Labor to provide voluntary mediation in union strikes. Steel workers in Gary launched a strike in 1937, and the division successfully prevented it from turning violent. As the end of his term neared, the former state party chairman Frederick Van Nuys, who had been elected Senator again, attempted take control of the party from the McNutt-Townsend faction. The battle was primarily over who would control federal patronage jobs. President Franklin Roosevelt intervened after Van Nuys opposed his plan to stack the United States Supreme Court, and used his own influence to have Van Nuys defeated in his reelection bid. Townsend at first agreed to go along with Roosevelt's plan, but after McNutt decided it would be to harmful to the state party, Townsend changed his mind, much to Roosevelt's chagrin.Gugin, p. 304 In the mid-term elections, Republican took the control of the Indiana House of Representatives, 51 to 49. The Republicans blocked Townsend's proposed new social programs, and attempted to roll back many of his predecessor's programs. The Senate blocked the bills from passage, and the session ended in deadlock. Only a few pieces of legislation were passed: the driver's license examination became required by law, pensions for the state's firemen were approved, free textbooks were authorized for public schools and the state ordered school buses to be painted yellow for safety's sake--this last starting a nationwide trend.Gugin, p. 305 Later life After Townsend left office, he extricated himself from internal politics of the state party, and did not involve himself in the selection of his successor. During World War II Townsend used his farm experience in government service, directing the Office of Agricultural War Relations, the Agricultural Conservation and Adjustment Administration, and the Food Production Administration. In 1943 he resigned from federal service and returned to Indiana to manage his farms in Blackford and Grant counties. Townsend was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in 1946, but was defeated by William E. Jenner. He died November 11, 1954 from a heart attack, and was buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Hartford City, Indiana.

Its attractions include Stingray Bay, Dino Dig, Valley Farm, Sea Lion Cove, African Adventure, and Ross Laird's Winged Wonders Bird Show. The zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). History=Early history The zoo was formed some time around 1908. The earliest zoo record describes a collection consisting of two bears and around fifty birds of various species. According to the zoo's website, \\"bears, local cats, hoof stock, and birds were added to the Zoo and housed in log cabin type exhibits.\\" The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) officially recognized the park opening in 1929 as the Roeding Park Zoo. Only few animals were seen, but that number would later rise. The year attendance was around 2,000 and most of the visitors were from Fresno and the surrounding areas. 19401960 The zoo grew substantially in the 1940s and 1950s, with 100 animals and more birds by 1947. The zoo's first foreman, Eldon \\"Curly\\" Blocker, was hired from the San Diego Zoo. In 1949, the zoo's Asian elephant Nosey (a name determined by a citywide \\"Name-the-Elephant\\" Contest) was acquired, with help from the Fresno Rotary Club. Her arrival coincided with Fresno's \\"49ers Days Rodeo Parade\\", and Nosey's presence in that parade was popular enough to spawn the creation of the Fresno Zoological Society, which would create interest in the zoo and provide a fundraising mechanism. In the 1950s, ten large exhibits were added to the zoo grounds with monkeys, sea lions, camels, giraffes, an African bird aviary, a flamingo habitat, and on- site feed and medical compounds. The zoo became an institutional member of the AZA in 1957. In 1965 Paul S. Chaffee was hired as the zoo's first director. In the late 1960s, the animal exhibits were renovated, with climate control being added to increase the comfort of the animals. In 1967, the large bird of prey exhibit was constructed, and in 1968, a master plan for future development was drafted. 19701990 Colorful tropical birds in the rain forest exhibit. The zoo's area expanded by a third, and new exhibits featuring bison, elk, and prairie dogs were added. In 1976, in honor of the American Bicentennial Celebration, the park's grizzly bear facility was expanded. In 1978, the Park Zoo Trust Fund (distinct from the Zoo Admissions Trust Fund) was established to make sure a portion of concession sales were used to improve the zoo. This freed the zoo from having to approve a budget with the City Council. In 1979, the zoo added the Edward A. Kane Reptile House, the world's first computer- controlled reptile habitat. In 1982, Nosey the Elephant's habitat was renovated and three new elephants were brought in. A red wolf exhibit known as Wolf Woods was added in 1984, and the Doris and Karl Falk Wildlife Education Center was completed, becoming part of the zoo's Educational Center. In 1985, the zoo's name changed from the Roeding Park Zoo to the Fresno Zoo. In 1988, the zoo's walk-through rainforest exhibit was added. 1989 saw the addition of a large classroom wing, and the implementation of the Adopt-an-Animal fundraising program. Paul S. Chaffee, the zoo's director since 1965, died in 1990, and the Fresno Zoo was renamed the Chaffee Zoological Gardens of Fresno in his honor. In 1993, Nosey the elephant died at the age of 47. 2000present The underwater viewing area at Sea Lion Cove. The Kopje Lodge, part of the new African Adventure exhibit. In 2004, \\"Measure Z\\" was passed by the voters (73%) in Fresno to raise money to expand the zoo, and to improve the animal exhibits. The US$150 million project was contingent upon the submission and review of an environmental impact report. The name of the zoo was shortened to Fresno Chaffee Zoo in 2006. In 2007, a traveling \\"Stingray Bay\\" exhibit visited and attracted large crowds. Several stingrays were bred while they were visiting Fresno. In 2009, a permanent Stingray Bay exhibit was opened, funded by Measure Z. In the rain forest exhibit, the former butterfly house (Maddis House) reopened as the Tropical Treasures exhibit in March 2009, with poison dart frogs and a sloth among other species. In August 2012, a very large Sea Lion Cove, designed after the Central Coast‚Äôs Point Lobos, was opened. It contains 250,000 gallon saltwater tank with rock outcrops and islands, while preserving the redwood trees that surround the enclosures. A 35-ft viewing glass allows guest to watch the sea lions underwater. This exhibit also includes pelicans. This was the first major exhibit funded by Measure Z. The old sea lion enclosure was repurposed for river otters. In January 2014, ground was broken for the approximately 18-acre \\"African Adventure\\" expansion doubling the size of the zoo and including large animal exhibits such as lions, breeding elephants, cheetahs, rhinos, meerkats, hippos, gorillas, and penguins. Measure Z, which provided funding for capital zoo projects, was renewed by voters in November 2014. On October 15, 2015, phase one of African Adventure opened. The 13 acre exhibit is home to over 100 animals including lions, African elephants, cheetahs, and rhinos. In 2016, the zoo opened the \\"Roo Walkabout,\\" an Australian walk-through exhibit which features red kangaroos, emus and kookaburras. That year set a new attendance record with just under 1 million visitors.

Life Born in Munich, Bavaria, she was the eldest daughter of Count Meinhard of Gorizia-Tyrol, and Elizabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Germany, widow of the late Hohenstaufen king Conrad IV of Germany. Elizabeth thus was a half-sister of Conradin, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Swabia. Elizabeth was in fact better connected to powerful German rulers than her future husband: a descendant of earlier monarchs, for example Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, she was also a niece of the Bavarian dukes,A list of her maternal ancestors Austria's important neighbors. Duchess and Queen Queen Elizabeth, donor portrait, 15th century She was married in Vienna on 20 December 1274 to Count Albert of Habsburg, eldest son and heir of the newly elected Rudolf I, King of the Romans, thus becoming daughter-in-law of the King of the Romans and Emperor- to-be. After Rudolf had defeated his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he invested his son Albert with the duchies of Austria and Styria at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg on 17 December 1282. Albert initially had to share the rule with his younger brother Rudolf II, who nevertheless had to waive his rights according to the Treaty of Rheinfelden the next year. Duke Albert and Elizabeth solidified their rule in what was to become the Habsburg \\"hereditary lands\\", also with the help of Elizabeth's father Meinhard, who in his turn was created Duke of Carinthia by King Rudolf I in 1286. Elizabeth was described as shrewd and enterprising, in possession of some commercial talents. The construction of the Saline plant in Salzkammergut goes back to her suggestion. Upon the death of Albert's father in 1291, the princes elected Count Adolf of Nassau German king, while Duke Albert himself became entangled in internal struggles with the Austrian nobility. Not until Adolf's deposition in 1298, Elizabeth's husband was finally elected King of the Romans on 23 June 1298. Two weeks later, Adolf was defeated and killed in the Battle of G√∂llheim. In 1299, Elizabeth was crowned Queen of the Romans in Nuremberg. K√∂nigsfelden monastery church Later life On 1 May 1308 her husband was murdered by his nephew John \\"the Parricide\\" near Windisch, Swabia (in modern-day Switzerland). After Albert's assassination, Elizabeth had the Poor Clare monastery of K√∂nigsfelden erected at the site, where she died on 28 October 1312 and was also buried. Today her mortal remains rest at Saint Paul's Abbey in Carinthia. Issue Elizabeth's and Albert's children were: # Rudolf III (ca. 1282 - 4 July 1307), married but line extinct.

His breakout season came in his junior year when he was named the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year. Stokes' junior season was rewarded with a top ten finish in the balloting for that year's Heisman Trophy, being the only junior recognized. Stokes' junior season ended with unanimous All-American recognition by The Sporting News, AP, UPI, and Kodak. Stokes' senior year began as the nation's leading Heisman contender but was quickly sidetracked by a severe upper thigh contusion suffered in the season's first game.

After a slow start to his rookie season, the former Bruin ultimately netted 38 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was tossed by Jerry Rice. During the 1996 season, Stokes suffered a broken hand and missed most of the season, leading to the emergence of the 49ers' third round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, wide receiver Terrell Owens.

Once Rice returned, Stokes' production did not falter as he would achieve career highs in receptions (63), yards (770) and touchdowns (eight). Stokes was also the recipient of Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski spitting in his face during a Monday Night Football game in December 1997. Along with the rest of the team, Stokes' production dropped in 1999 as a result of Young's career-ending concussion in a Monday night game in Arizona. Football Outsiders called Stokes \\"the league's least valuable receiver\\" in 1999.

Academic career Markoviƒá took a doctorate in philosophy first at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1955, and then another in 1956 at University College London. There he studied logic under A. J. Ayer, and wrote his thesis on The Concept of Logic. In 1963 he became a full professor of philosophy at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, and the dean of the faculty in the period 1966‚Äì1967. From 1960 to 1962 he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Philosophy. In the 1970s, he taught at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was a director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. He also taught for many years at the University of Pennsylvania, first as a frequent visiting professor from 1972 to 1980 and then as an adjunct professor from 1981 to 1993. Markoviƒá was a co-Chairman of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (1975‚Äì1985). He has been a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1963 and a full member since 1983. In his honour, a collection of articles entitled Philosophy and Society was published in Belgrade in 1987. Social critic After the Resolution of the Informbiro condemning the Yugoslav communist regime, Markoviƒá took part in a fierce debate against Stalinist dogmatism, becoming one of the fiercest critics of the Stalinist philosophical theses. His Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR, published in 1952, was the first major attack on the Stalinist philosophy in Yugoslavia. In the 1960s Markoviƒá became a major proponent of the Praxis School of Marxist interpretation, which emphasized the writings of young Marx, and their dialectical and humanist aspects in particular. He also actively contributed to the international journal Praxis. Due to his critical observations, together with seven other professors from the Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade, Markoviƒá was suspended in January 1975, and finally lost his job in January 1981. After that, Markoviƒá worked in the Institute of Social Research until his retirement in 1986. As a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1986, Markoviƒá, together with others, wrote the SANU Memorandum, a document that has formulated the central tenets of Serbian nationalism. While the document has been viewed in some neighbouring former Yugoslav republics as a preparation for full-scale Greater Serbian expansionism, many Serbs considered it a realistic depiction of the Serbian position within Yugoslav federation. During the Breakup of Yugoslavia, Markoviƒá considered that the borders of the country should be changed based on ethnic and historical grounds. Markoviƒá considered that Republic of Serbian Krajina, eastern Slavonia, Baranja and western Srem should not belong to Croatia because the Serbian people have lived in these territories for most of the centuries. He also considered that \\"the Albanian people lack any historical reasons to support their right to Kosovo\\", as they did not live in the territory before the arrival of the Slavs. Political activity Markoviƒá was vice-president of the Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's Socialist Party of Serbia from 1990 to 1992, as well as its one time chief ideologue. At other times, he was a vocal critic of the official SPS party line. In November 1995 he was released from all duties in the party.Praxis ‚Äì critical thinking and acting, 2009 interview with Mihailo Markoviƒá (in Serbian) Bibliography * Revision of the Philosophical Bases of Marxism in the USSR (1952) * Logic (1956) * Formalism in Contemporary Logic (1957) * Dialectical Theory of Meaning, Belgrade 1961 * Humanism and Dialectics (1967) * Dialektik der Praxis, Humanizm i djalektika, Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 1968 * Att utveckla socialismen, Stockholm, 1971 * From Affluence to Praxis (Philosophy and social criticism), Ann Arbor, 1974 * The Contemporary Marx, Nottingham, 1974 * Philosophical Foundations of Science, Belgrade 1982 * Selected Works in eight volumes, Belgrade, 1994 * Freedom and Praxis, Belgrade 1997 * Social Thought at the Border of Milenia, 1999 * Storming the Sky: Memoirs, 2008 See also * Simo Elakoviƒá ReferencesExternal links * Mihailo Markoviƒá Archive * The Notion of Revolution (in Serbian) * Equality and Freedom (in Serbian) * The Causes of breaking up of Yugoslavia (in Serbian) * Reason and Ethos (in Serbian) * The Memorandum: Roots of Serbian nationalism: an interview with Mihailo Markoviƒá and Vasilije Krestiƒá * Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts: Answer to the Criticisms * Biography and Bibliography of Markoviƒá (in Serbian) * 1999 NIN article about Mihailo Markoviƒá and the Praxis School (in Serbian) * Philosophy as a Way of Life ‚Äì an interview with Mihailo Markovic (in Serbian) * A sort of super-Serb defends Serbian policy ‚Äì an interview with Markovic (in English) * A Counter-revolution, and not all that velvety ‚Äì an interview with Markovic (in English) * Philosophy that is Lived ‚Äì a tribute to Markovic (in Serbian) Category:1923 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Belgrade Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Serbian writers Category:Serbian atheists Category:Scholars of Marxism Category:Social philosophy Category:20th-century Serbian philosophers Category:Serbian political philosophers Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:Members of the Association of Writers of Serbia Category:University of Belgrade faculty Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy alumni Category:Alumni of University College London Category:League of Communists of Serbia politicians Category:Socialist Party of Serbia politicians Category:Serbian humanists Category:Yugoslav philosophers Category:University of Michigan faculty ","title":"Mihailo Markoviƒá"},{"id":"4157034","text":"Arthur Avil√©s (born 1963) is an American Bessie Award-winning dancer and choreographer of Puerto Rican descent.La Fountain-Stokes, Lawrence.

They are abundant in Mediterranean regions, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and Macaronesia, but can also be found in Central Europe and temperate Asia.http://www.iama.gr/ethno/sideritis/tsai_tou_vounou_files/Tsai_tou_vounou_Lora%20Prokou%20_%20Eleni_Skaltsa.pdf History and etymology In Greek \\"sideritis\\" (Gr: œÉŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÅŒØœÑŒπœÇ) can be literally translated as \\"he who is made of iron\\". The plant was known to ancient Greeks, specifically Pedanius Dioscorides and Theophrastus. Although Dioscorides describes three species, only one (probably S. scordioides) is thought to belong to Sideritis. In ancient times \\"sideritis\\" was a generic reference for plants capable of healing wounds caused by iron weapons during battles. However, others hold that the name stems from the shape of the sepal, which resembles the tip of a spear. Taxonomy Sideritis scardica In 2002, molecular phylogenetic research found Sideritis and five other genera to be embedded in Stachys. Further studies will be needed before Stachys, Sideritis, and their closest relatives can be revised. Some schemes recognize and categorize up to 319 distinct species, subspecies, ecotypes, forms or cultivars, including:such as Wikispecies, ITIS and ZipcodeZoo *Sideritis barbellata Mend.-Heu. - endemic to the Canary Island of La Palma. *Sideritis candicans Aiton - endemic to Madeira, Bugio Island and Porto Santo Island. *Sideritis cypria Post - endemic to Cyprus *Sideritis euboea Heldr - found in the island of Euboea *Sideritis hyssopifolia L. - mountains of the Iberian Peninsula *Sideritis lanata L. *Sideritis leucantha Cav. *Sideritis montana L. *Sideritis purpurea Talb. - found in western Greece, the Ionian Islands and Crete *Sideritis raiseri Boiss & Heldr - found in Mount Tomori, Albania *Sideritis remota Urv. *Sideritis romana L. *Sideritis scardica Gris. - also known as Pirin or Olympus tea after its native areas of Pirin and Mount Olympus *Sideritis syriaca L., S. cretica Boiss, S. boissieri Magn. - found in Crete and collectively known as Malotira () *Sideritis theezans Boiss & Heldr - found in the Peloponnese Botanists have encountered difficulties in naming and classifying the varieties of Sideritis due to their subtle differences. One particularly confusing case is that of S. angustifolia Lagasca and S. tragoriganum Lagasca. Botany The genus is composed of short (8‚Äì50 cm), xerophytic subshrubs or herbs, annual or perennial, that grow at high altitudes (usually over 1000 m) with little or no soil, often on the surface of rocks. It is pubescent, either villous or coated by a fine, woolly layer of microscopic intertwined hairs. Sideritis inflorescence is verticillaster. Gallery File:Sideritis montana Sturm23.jpg Uses and benefits Ironwort herbal tea. Very popular in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Turkey, Sideritis scardica, Sideritis clandestina, Sideritis syriaca, Sideritis perfoliata and various others species from the section Empedoclia are used as a herb either for the preparation of herbal teas, or for its aromatic properties in local cuisines. The herbal tea is commonly prepared by decoction, by boiling the stems, leaves and flowers in a pot of water, then often serving with honey and lemon. Ironwort has been traditionally used to aid digestion, strengthen the immune system and suppress common cold, the flu and other viruses, allergies and shortness of breath, sinus congestion, even pain and mild anxiety. Scientists have suggested that the popular pronouncement of ironwort as panacea may have some basis in fact. Studies indicate a positive effect on many common ailments. Ironwort is known scientifically to be anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant. Active elements include diterpenoid and flavonoids. Significant research has been done on ironwort confirming its popular use to prevent colds, flu, and allergies. Most of this research has taken place in universities in the Netherlands and in the southern Balkans where the plant is indigenous. Cultivation Sideritis raeseri is the most commonly cultivated Sideritis in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and North Macedonia, where advanced hybrids also exist. Planting is recommended during two periods (October‚ÄìNovember or February‚ÄìMarch in the Northern hemisphere) and gathering in July, when in full bloom. The plant is typically dried before usage.http://www.iama.gr/ethno/sideritis/tsai_tou_vounou_files/Tsai_tou_vounou_Gkoliaris_Apostolos.pdf  References  External links  *Classification *Sideritis Reviews * Sideritis and Alzheimer's Photos: *S. romana *S. lanata Category:Lamiaceae genera Category:Herbal tea Category:Albanian drinks Category:Greek drinks Category:Bulgarian drinks ","title":"Sideritis"},{"id":"4157064","text":"Hubert Max Lanier (August 18, 1915 ‚Äì January 30, 2007) was an American left- handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in earned run average in 1943, and was the winning pitcher of the clinching game in the 1944 World Series against the crosstown St. Louis Browns. His son Hal became a major league infielder and manager. Career Lanier in 1941 Born in Denton, North Carolina, Lanier was one of a handful of players who remained active during the World War II years. A naturally right-handed player, he had become a left- handed pitcher only because he twice broke his right arm in childhood. After signing with the Cardinals in 1937, he reached the major leagues in 1938. He had arguably his best season in 1943, compiling a 15‚Äì7 record with a league- best 1.90 ERA. In 1944 he won a career-high 17 games, and was the winner of the final game of the World Series against the crosstown Browns. He was named an NL All-Star in both 1943 and 1944. Lanier, along with a dozen other major leaguers, defected to the Mexican League in 1946 after being offered a salary nearly double what he was making with the Cardinals. Disappointed by poor playing conditions and allegedly broken contract promises, he tried to return to the Cardinals in 1948, but was barred by an order from commissioner Happy Chandler, imposing a five-year suspension on all players who had jumped to the Mexican League. In response, Lanier and teammate Fred Martin, as well as Danny Gardella of the New York Giants, sued Major League Baseball in federal court, challenging baseball's reserve clause as a violation of U.S. antitrust law (preceding the similar suit by Curt Flood some 25 years later). Chandler reinstated Lanier and the other players in June 1949. Lanier immediately held out for more money than he was being paid at the time of his leaving for Mexico, but eventually signed a contract paying him the same amount as in 1946.Max Lanier signs Card contract for $11,500 Lanier rejoined the Cardinals in 1949. After winning a total of 101 games for the club, he ended his career with the New York Giants (1952‚Äì53) and the Browns (1953). Over fourteen seasons, Lanier posted a 108‚Äì82 record with 821 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 1619 innings pitched, including 21 shutouts and 91 complete games. Lanier died at age 91 in Dunnellon, Florida.

They blend hard rock, original rock, southern rock, folk music, and country rock. They formed in 1991, and continue to tour extensively in the midwest area. Along with their seven album releases and four DVDs, they have also released four \\"official bootleg\\" albums of their live recordings. Their most recent release \\"Live at the Leaf\\" chronicles a weekend in New Orleans playing at the legendary Maple Leaf. It was released in 2018. History The core of Mr. Blotto is the brother songwriting team of Mike and Paul Bolger, who had played together in garage rock bands throughout high school. They went in separate directions musically when they attended different colleges, Mike leaning towards the hardcore punk stylings of H√ºsker D√º, and Paul focusing on the resurgence of 70s rock like Aerosmith, while eventually discovering Crosby, Stills and Nash and the Grateful Dead, who would later become huge influences. After Paul graduated he decided to pursue the life of a full-time musician while Mike opted to become a lawyer. Paul landed a gig as the house singer in a Polish club in Chicago called \\"The Cardinal Club.\\" It was here that Paul met guitarist Bob Georges and they decided to begin playing together. Earlier the Bolger brothers played in the 1980s in a group called Fred, alongside future members of the Freddy Jones Band.Mr. Blotto . Lake Magazine, September 2007. Paul and Bob found drummer Alan Baster at a jazz night, and hired him on. After several auditions for a bass player yielded no results, Paul convinced Mike to be an interim bass player. The band as a four-piece started hitting Chicago area open mic nights and outlying bars, developing their roots- oriented jamband sound and weaving a large amount of reworked Grateful Dead songs into their sets to supplement the originals being penned by Paul, Mike and Bob. As their audience grew, Mike quit being a lawyer and became a full- fledged member. They released Parking Karma and found their way into the larger bars and venues of the Chicago scene. After the album was released, Dave Allen - an old college bandmate of Paul's - joined on keyboards, filling out the bass-acoustic guitar-electric guitar-keyboards-drums ensemble that has remained consistent through personnel changes since. In addition to Piano, Synths, & Hammond B-3, Dave supplied another singing voice and an ability to improvise lyrics that complemented a long-standing element of the early Blotto show, the \\"Reggae Rap,\\" in which Paul would freestyle over a rock-steady type of beat. In the mid-90s, they released a second CD, \\"Bad Hair Day,\\" and continued their process of steadily playing shows in the Chicago area. By the end of the decade they had built their audience to the point that they were a significant draw at local performances and festivals.\\"Taking It to the Street: Festival Season Coming\\". Chicago Tribune, April 25, 2003.\\"You're Irish? You're Over 12? You Have No Kids? No Problem\\". Daily Herald, June 18, 2001. 1998 saw a third CD, Ancient Face; in 1999 Bob Georges was replaced by Mark Hague. The introduction of Mark (who had played with the Freddy Jones Band) marked a creative period for the band, and he helped pen the next generation of Mr. Blotto tunes. Paul, Mark & Mike started meeting every Monday to work on new original ideas. In these sessions, any idea would be chased down and put to tape. These songs became Cabbages and Kings, the 4th CD which (93.1) WXRT called the band's best release yet. Around this time, the band addressed the constant demand for a Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog-to-digital converter, a distribution amplifier, and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain board patch in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often in advance of the band‚Äîthis is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour. Seeing as not everyone had a portable CD burner or DAT, Mr. Blotto began issuing Live Shows and Compilations. The Bootleg Series is a single CD of songs handpicked by the band for their unique characteristics, where the Just Did It series is made up of double-disc sets from one particular show or run of shows. In 2005, Alan Baster left the band....and Mr. Blotto picked up a drummer from Indiana by the name of Tony Dellumo. Shortly thereafter Paul, Mark, Mike, Tony and Dave started in on a new album that was finished spring 2006. With help of the Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow, Mr. Blotto released their 5th studio album: \\"Barlow Shanghai.\\" When Dave \\"B3\\" Allen had to leave the band at the end of 2005, Mr. Blotto hired on another well- established musician in the Northwest Indiana music scene by the name of Steve Ball. Steve Ball is best known in Northwest Indiana and the Chicago music scene as not only a keyboard player, but also a guitar, bass, mandolin and harmonica journeyman. In 2007, the group released an album jointly written with John Perry Barlow, who had previously worked as a lyricist with the Grateful Dead.Barlow Meets Blotto on Album.

Life Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court at Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics. Louis I d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Longueville, first cousin once removed of King Louis XII of France, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented from doing so because an illustrious political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice- divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, a member of the upper nobility of France related to several royal families, was a good choice. Anne was betrothed in 1500, a marriage contract was confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court at Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day. Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery. She was 22. Children Although Anna was Vladislaus II's third wife, she gave birth to his only surviving legitimate children, both of whom were born in Buda: * Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, later Queen consort of Hungary and Bohemia. Married Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and they inherited Bohemia and what was left of Hungary. * Louis II of Hungary, born on July 1, 1506, killed at the Battle of Moh√°cs on August 29, 1526. Married Mary of Habsburg; their marriage was childless, although he fathered illegitimate issue.

He is currently a color commentator for coverage of the Arena Football League's Tampa Bay Storm on the regional sports television network Spectrum Sports Florida. He has also co-hosted various sports radio shows since retiring.  Career = 1994 AFC Wildcard Game  Royals may be best known for a bad punt he kicked in the 1993 NFL season AFC wildcard game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs on January 8, 1994. Near the end of the fourth quarter with Pittsburgh leading Kansas City by seven points, Royals failed to direct a punt towards a sideline, and instead, punted the ball forward directly towards the line of scrimmage. The punt was blocked and recovered by Kansas City. With 1:43 remaining in the fourth quarter and on 4th down, Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to receiver Tim Barnett. The ensuing PAT tied the game which then went into sudden death overtime. Kansas City kicker Nick Lowery eventually kicked the game winning field goal for the Chiefs eliminating the Steelers from the playoffs. Royals was cut from the Steelers roster later in 1994.

From November 2014 through the end of his 2018 contract, Lanier, served as the first manager of the Ottawa Champions of the independent Can-Am League. From through , Lanier played for the San Francisco Giants (1964‚Äì71) and New York Yankees (1972‚Äì73). He is the son of Max Lanier, a former MLB All-Star pitcher. Playing career In his rookie season Lanier posted a career-high .274 batting average for the San Francisco Giants and was selected for the 1964 Topps All-Star Rookie team. Lanier ran into trouble with Willie Mays in 1965. Due to the unpredictable winds at Candlestick Park, Mays used to position the infielders on how to play the ball. When Lanier ignored his signal a couple times during a game, Mays asked manager Herman Franks to bench him a few games.Mays, pp. 158-59 However, by the end of the season, Mays had made Lanier the infield captain for the Giants, in charge of taking a trip to the mound if a pitcher needed a break.Mays, p. 220 In 1968, Lanier led NL shortstops in putouts (282) and fielding average (.979). After that, he moved from second base to shortstop, and finally to third base. He also played in part of two seasons with the New York Yankees. In a 10-season career, Lanier was a .228 hitter with eight home runs and 273 RBI in 1196 games played. In each of the three seasons from 1967 to 1969 he ranked last among NL qualifiers in average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. Managerial career Following his playing career, Lanier managed in the minors and served as third base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1981‚Äì85, including the 1982 World Series and National League champion teams. He then went on to manage the Houston Astros from 1986‚Äì88 and had a 254-232 win-loss record. In 1986, he was named NL Manager of the Year by the BBWA and TSN for leading the Astros to their first Division Title since 1980 and the best record (96-66) in team history up to that point. A power struggle between Lanier and Astros' general manager Dick Wagner in 1987 eventually led to Wagner leaving the team. In 1988, the Astros lost a home game to the San Francisco Giants. As the team prepared to eat the post-game meal, take showers, and go home, they received word they were wanted back on the field. Lanier brought out the batting cage and ordered the team to take batting practice again. Lanier was fired at the end of the season. In recent years, Lanier has managed in the independent minor leagues. He managed for the Winnipeg Goldeyes in the Northern League for several years, then moved to the Can-Am League to manage the Sussex Skyhawks. While with the Skyhawks, Lanier led the team to the league championship in 2008 over the Quebec Capitales in the Can-Am League Championship Series. He left the Skyhawks following the 2009 season to become manager of the Normal CornBelters. On December 12, 2012, the Yuma Desert Rats of the independent American West Baseball League, announced they had come to terms with Lanier to manage the Desert Rats for the 2013 season, however the team folded before playing a game. On November 18, 2014, the Ottawa Champions of the Can-Am League announced that Lanier would be their manager for the 2015 season.

Her son, Matt, served in the U.S. Army and was killed on May 27, 2005, as a result of injuries received in combat over Buhriz, Iraq, where he was serving in his second tour of duty. Lourey was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1990, running against a long-time incumbent Republican, and became the first woman to represent her rural district. She was re-elected in 1992 and 1994. She ran for and was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1996, again defeating a veteran incumbent, later becoming chair of the Senate Health and Family Security Committee and earning a reputation as an expert on health care. Lourey did not run for re-election in 2006. Her son, Tony, held her former seat until 2018, after which he was appointed to Governor Tim Walz's cabinet. 2006 Campaign for Governor Lourey announced her candidacy for Governor in November 2005. She lost the DFL Party endorsement to Attorney General Mike Hatch, gaining the support of 31% of the delegates on the first ballot, with 38% voting for Hatch and 29% voting for Steve Kelley. She withdrew from the endorsement process after the third ballot after falling behind Kelley, with Hatch's vote total increasing. She subsequently ran an opposition campaign against Hatch in the September primary, losing with 24% of the popular vote. Lourey's gubernatorial campaign health care platform was the Health Care Security Plan, which included the details to put a universal health coverage system in place in Minnesota by 2010. That system would have been voluntary, not mandatory as was the Massachusetts health program that was enacted into law in Spring 2006. The platform also included other state-level health reform proposals, including the current Minnesota Medical Association's proposal. At the heart of the Lourey health care plan was an expanded and reformed MinnesotaCare, a state program providing health insurance coverage for low-income Minnesotans that she, along with several others, had authored in the state legislature in 1993. Under her Health Care Security Plan, all Minnesotans would have been eligible to join the new MinnesotaCare by 2010. Employers could participate by offering their employer plan via the new BusinessCare program to be created as part of the revised MinnesotaCare. There were several cost containment measures in Lourey's Health Care Security Plan, including a requirement that any HMOs, private health insurers or Third Party Administrators receiving contracts to administer state-funded health plans spend no more than 5% on administrative expenses.

History= Foundation of Smila  Smila and its neighbourhood have been settled since the ancient times. Archeologists discovered a number of ruins of ancient settlements and numerous mounds located in different parts of Smila and near the city. Two biggest ancient settlements and 44 mounds were first researched during 1879‚Äì1883 years by O. O. Bobrynsky, grandson of Smila owner, Count Olexiy Olexiyovich Bobrynsky. These findings belong partly to the Stone Age and partly to the Bronze Age. Official foundation date of Smila is 1542. Grand Duchy of Lithuania documents tell us that settlement Yatzkove-Tyasmyno was founded on a hamlet place in 1542. The modern name of the city has been known since the first half of the 17th century. City's name is connected with a local legend first recorded by Count L. O. Bobrynsky: \\"An unknown girl led warriors through a heavy swamp showing a route to the enemy. The battle was very bloody. They killed a lot of enemies there but they couldn‚Äôt save the brave girl. They buried her near Tyasmyn and called her Smila.It means - brave Then warriors honoured her in the city‚Äôs name.\\"  1569 - 1793  After the Union of Lublin in July 1569, it was a settlement of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.

During 1730s-1760s parts of the population of Smila took part in Haidamaka movement. In 1787 prince Xaveriy Lubomirski sold lands around Smila to Russian prince Potyomkin. Six years later Smila became a property of Potyomkin's nephew, Count Alexander Samoylov. Two years later population of Smila was 1747 people with 50 crafters, 9 shoemakers, 6 weavers, 8 tailors.

After Mariazell, Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of Austria. Geography Maria Taferl is located in the Nibelungengau in Lower Austria on a bank over the Danube. 47.48 percent of the municipality is forested. As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called \\"Taferlberg\\" (Taferl Mountain), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area. To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town. History The Opferstein (Sacrifice Rock) Little is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl. The Celtic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube. During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the Province of Noricum. Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity. Maria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the Ostarrichi during the time of the Bambergs in the Middle Ages. It then became part of the Habsburg holdings. For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Wei√üenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of M√ºnichreith. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century. The first church was built around a shrine to the Holy Mother, which is the origin of the name \\"Maria Taferl.\\" The legends say that the statue of the Piet√† at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness. It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding. The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue. The church building was built from 1660 to 1710. Its construction was begun under the imperial architect Georg Gerstenbrand and the Italian Carlo Lurago. Its famous cupola was built by Jakob Prandtauer from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of Melk Abbey. The Maria Taferl church is built in the baroque style with ample amounts of gold leaf and a frescoed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature. The building's rear houses its crypt. According to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the Plague, the Turkish Wars, and the Thirty Years' War had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the Counter-Reformation in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube. There are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century. The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 masses said there. The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number. Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured. Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of Freistadt for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his family lived in the nearby Artstetten Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl. Maria Taferl became a Basilica minor in 1947. By 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered. Besides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups. There is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints. Other landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins.

It is mainly cultivated due to the high levels of erucic acid that are contained in its seeds. The crambe oil is used for industrial purposes and its side products can be partly used as animal feed.  Botany  Crambe abyssinica has its origins in eastern Africa and was domesticated in the Mediterranean region. It grows up to a height between , depending on field conditions. Its cropping cycle is rather short, ranging from 90 to 100 days. Usually, its straight stalk is moderately branched and its leaves are of an oval shape. The plant‚Äôs flowers are small and white, arranged in racemes and have four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two shorter and four longer free stamens, what is typical for Brassicaceae. Mostly, these flowers are self- pollinated, but some cases of cross-pollination have been observed. Its indehiscent fruits enclose only one spherical seed that contains around 26% protein, 18% fibre and 35% oil. This oil content is lower than what can be extracted from rapeseed and the oil is not edible. The pericarp of the seed usually adheres to the seed even at harvest.  History of agricultural use and cultivation  Crambe has not been in cultivation for a long time. It was probably cultivated for the first time in the 1930s in the former USSR. Later the crop was tested in other regions of the USSR, in Sweden and in Poland, where crambe was grown on 25,000 ha (~62,000 acres) after the second world war. Research efforts in northern and eastern Europe were increased and the agronomical characteristics and industrial uses of crambe were intensively studied. By successive selection within C. abyssinica, conventional breeding started in the 1950s in some European countries. Hereby improved strains were introduced to Canada and the United States. Further selection and crossing of different accessions led to the release of new varieties in the 1970s. Through introgression of wild populations and mass selection two new cultivars were created in the 1980s which were promoted as high yielding sources of erucic acid. In the 1990s a breeding program was started in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, after a period of great efforts to bring crambe into extended cultivation, interest in the crop in Europe has declined in recent years.  Cultivation  With a germination temperature of which is also equivalent to the basal growing temperature, C. abyssinica is a winter crop in southern Europe and subtropical areas whereas it is cultivated as spring crop in northern Europe and more continental areas. The optimal growing temperature is approximately . It tolerates annual average temperature between and frost down to . Because of its ability to get along with only of precipitation, C. abyssinica is considered to be relatively drought tolerant. Nevertheless, drought stress during the development stages of flowering and grain filling reduces productivity. Cultivation is possible up to an annual precipitation of . Crambe has modest demands regarding soil properties, it tolerates soil pH from 5.0 to 7.8. Low soil depth and a high stone and gravel content decrease drought tolerance. Seeds of many improved varieties are available on the market and are sown at a rate of approximately and at a depth of . Seed maturation is uniform and the 1000 seed weight varies between . Management procedures from sowing to harvesting can be conducted largely with the same machinery used for common cereals. Yield levels vary widely between in Russia, in the U.S. and in Germany. Crambe abyssinica can be easily inserted in crop rotations with a requirement of 1600 growing degree-days. Its rotation contingent should not exceed 25%. Because of similar soil requirements and increased soil borne pathogen pressure, cultivation directly after other Brassicaceae species should be avoided. Also to be avoided is cultivation after artificial grassland and fallows because these will enrich the soil seed bank with weeds and there are few pre-emergence weed management methods available.  Use  Crambe abyssinica is cultivated for a wide range of industrial purposes. The interest lies mainly in the high erucic acid content (55-60%) of its seed oil and makes the crop a competitive option to other oil plants as industrial rapeseed. The composition of crambe oil gives this product several special traits, such as high smoke point, good wettability of different materials and high viscosity. In addition, its oil has a higher biodegradability than mineral oils. Therefore, erucic acid derived compounds are used as additives in the plastic industry, high temperature hydraulic fluids, waxes, base for paints and coatings, lubricants and many other products. Furthermore, the extracted seed oil is used in pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. The crambe meal, which is a side product of industrial oil production, can be used as a protein supplement for animal feed. It contains approximately 46% proteins, which are of high nutritional quality. Unfortunately, the crambe seed shred also contains toxic compounds such as glucosinolates, tannins and inositol phosphate. The use as forage is therefore very limited. The incorporation rate of crambe by-products into animal feed should not be higher than 5% for growing-finishing pigs, 15% for dairy cows, and 19% for sheep. It is not recommended to feed poultry.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2018. Crambe (Crambe abyssinica). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/45 A possible new use for crambe could be biofuels since the oil composition is suitable for processing.  Current and future breeding efforts  Genetically, C. abyssinica has a set of 2n=90 chromosomes and is hexaploid. However, it shows low genetic variation in important agronomic traits, e.g. erucic acid content. Thus, improvement of cultivars through selection is difficult to achieve. A new source of variation could be found in the related taxon Crambe hispanica. Recent efforts are found in the field of gene technology. To overcome the limited genetic variation, gene technology has been used in recent years to improve different important agronomic traits of crambe. Site-directed mutagenesis could be another tool for further improvement of the crop. However, the genetic control of many agronomic traits are unknown, thus the potential for genetic improvement is limited at the moment. Additionally further research aims to assess the potential of using the seed cake in protein-based plastic production and to find further uses for the whole plant.

Located at the intersection of West 231st Street and Broadway in the Kingsbridge and Riverdale sections of the Bronx, it is served by the 1 train at all times. History This station opened on January 27, 1907, as 230th Street station. It was built near the site of the originally proposed northern terminus of the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line at Bailey Avenue and 230th Street, a block southeast of the current station. It was also located near two former Kingsbridge railroad stations owned by two separate railways inherited by the New York Central Railroad; one was along a former segment of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad (now the Hudson Line), and the other was for the New York and Putnam Railroad (now abandoned). In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to stop at this station. Previously, the station could only hold six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000. In 2002, it was announced that 231st Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations. The station was extensively renovated in 2003‚Äì2004, which included installation of elevators for both platforms to make it fully ADA-accessible and replacing the exit-only turnstiles on the 242nd Street-bound platform with both High Entry/Exit and Exit-only turnstiles, allowing both access and exit from that side. Station layout Exterior This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center track that bypasses this station is not used in revenue service. This is the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line's southernmost station in the Bronx, as Marble Hill‚Äì225th Street station is physically on the mainland of New York State, but legally part of Manhattan. Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and outlines in the center and green waist-high, steel fences at either ends with lampposts at regular intervals. The platforms are offset with the Manhattan-bound platform to the south of the 242nd Street-bound one. The station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering. There are two sets of artwork at this station. One of them was made in 1991 and is called Elevated Nature I-IV by Wopo Holup. It consists of gray marble tiles with a green border on the platform walls of the station house. It is also located at four other stations on this line. The other artwork was made in 2007 by Felipe Galindo and is called Magic Realism in Kingsbridge. It consists of stained glass panels on the platform windscreens depicting images of the surrounding area. Each platform has an adjacent same-level station house in the center. However, only the station house of the Manhattan-bound platform is open to the public. A set of doors from the platform leads to a small waiting area and a bank of turnstiles. On the 242nd Street-bound platform, a set of High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles lead to a passageway around the station house separated from the platform by a metal fence. Exits Outside the fare control area on the Manhattan-bound platform, there is a token booth, two staircases going down to either western corners of 231st Street and Broadway, and one elevator going down to the southwest corner. Two emergency gates on the platform lead directly to each of the staircases. Outside the fare control area on the 242nd Street-bound platform, there are two staircases going down to either eastern corners of 231st Street and Broadway and one elevator going down to the northeast corner.

The enzyme facilitates the coupling of this reaction to the formation of a nucleoside triphosphate molecule (either GTP or ATP) from an inorganic phosphate molecule and a nucleoside diphosphate molecule (either GDP or ADP). It plays a key role as one of the catalysts involved in the citric acid cycle, a central pathway in cellular metabolism, and it is located within the mitochondrial matrix of a cell. Chemical reaction and enzyme mechanism Succinyl CoA synthetase catalyzes the following reversible reaction: :Succinyl CoA + Pi + NDP ‚Üî Succinate + CoA + NTP where Pi denotes inorganic phosphate, NDP denotes nucleoside diphosphate (either GDP or ADP), and NTP denotes nucleoside triphosphate (either GTP or ATP). As mentioned, the enzyme facilitates coupling of the conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate with the formation of NTP from NDP and Pi. The reaction has a biochemical standard state free energy change of -3.4 kJ/mol. The reaction takes place by a three-step mechanism which is depicted in the image below. The first step involves displacement of CoA from succinyl CoA by a nucleophilic inorganic phosphate molecule to form succinyl phosphate. The enzyme then utilizes a histidine residue to remove the phosphate group from succinyl phosphate and generate succinate. Finally, the phosphorylated histidine transfers the phosphate group to a nucleoside diphosphate, which generates the high-energy carrying nucleoside triphosphate. Mechanism for the reaction catalyzed by Succinyl-CoA Synthetase.  Structure= Subunits  Bacterial and mammalian SCSs are made up of Œ± and Œ≤ subunits. In E. coli two Œ±Œ≤ heterodimers link together to form an Œ±2Œ≤2 heterotetrameric structure. However, mammalian mitochondrial SCSs are active as Œ±Œ≤ dimers and do not form a heterotetramer. The E. coli SCS heterotetramer has been crystallized and characterized in great detail. As can be seen in Image 2, the two Œ± subunits (pink and green) reside on opposite sides of the structure and the two Œ≤ subunits (yellow and blue) interact in the middle region of the protein. The two Œ± subunits only interact with a single Œ≤ unit, whereas the Œ≤ units interact with a single Œ± unit (to form the Œ±Œ≤ dimer) and the Œ≤ subunit of the other Œ±Œ≤ dimer. A short amino acid chain links the two Œ≤ subunits which gives rise to the tetrameric structure. Image 2: The E. coli Succinyl-CoA Synthetase Heterotetramer; Œ± subunits: pink and green, Œ≤ subunits: yellow and blue. Pink and yellow form the one dimer and green and blue form the other dimer. PDB ID: 1CQG The crystal structure of Succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit (succinyl-CoA-binding isoform) was determined by Joyce et al. to a resolution of 2.10 A, with PDB code 1CQJ. .  Catalytic residues  Crystal structures for the E. coli SCS provide evidence that the coenzyme A binds within each Œ±-subunit (within a Rossmann fold) in close proximity to a histidine residue (His246Œ±). This histidine residue becomes phosphorylated during the succinate forming step in the reaction mechanism. The exact binding location of succinate is not well-defined. The formation of the nucleoside triphosphate occurs in an ATP grasp domain, which is located near the N-terminus of the each Œ≤ subunit. However, this grasp domain is located about 35 √Ö away from the phosphorylated histidine residue. This leads researchers to believe that the enzyme must undergo a major change in conformation to bring the histidine to the grasp domain and facilitate the formation of the nucleoside triphosphate. Mutagenesis experiments have determined that two glutamate residues (one near the catalytic histidine, Glu208Œ± and one near the ATP grasp domain, Glu197Œ≤) play a role in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the histidine, but the exact mechanism by which the enzyme changes conformation is not fully understood.  Isoforms  Johnson et al. describe two isoforms of succinyl-CoA synthetase in mammals, one that specifies synthesis of ADP, and one that synthesises GDP. * - ADP-forming - * - GDP-forming - , In mammals, the enzyme is a heterodimer of an Œ±- and a Œ≤-subunit. The specificity for either adenosine or guanosine phosphates is defined by the Œ≤-subunit, which is encoded by 2 genes. SUCLG2 is GTP-specific and SUCLA2 is ATP-specific, while SUCLG1 encodes the common Œ±-subunit. Œ≤ variants are produced at different amounts in different tissues, causing GTP or ATP substrate requirements. Mostly consuming tissues such as heart and brain have more ATP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase (ATPSCS), while synthetic tissues such as kidney and liver have the more GTP-specific form (GTPSCS). Kinetics analysis of ATPSCS from the breast muscle of pigeons and GTPSCS from pigeon liver showed that their apparent Michaelis constants were similar for CoA, but different for the nucleotides, phosphate, and succinate. The largest difference was for succinate: Kmapp of ATPSCS = 5mM versus that of GTPSCS = 0.5mM.  Function = Generation of nucleoside triphosphates  SCS is the only enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes a reaction in which a nucleoside triphosphate (GTP or ATP) is formed by substrate-level phosphorylation. Research studies have shown that E. coli SCSs can catalyze either GTP or ATP formation. However, mammals possess different types of SCSs that are specific for either GTP (G-SCS) or ATP (A-SCS) and are native to different types of tissue within the organism. An interesting study using pigeon cells showed that GTP specific SCSs were located in pigeon liver cells, and ATP specific SCSs were located in the pigeon breast muscle cells. Further research revealed a similar phenomenon of GTP and ATP specific SCSs in rat, mouse, and human tissue. It appears that tissue typically involved in anabolic metabolism (like the liver and kidneys) express G-SCS, whereas tissue involved in catabolic metabolism (like the brain, the heart, and muscular tissue) express A-SCS.  Formation of metabolic intermediates  SCS facilitates the flux of molecules into other metabolic pathways by controlling the interconversion between succinyl CoA and succinate. This is important because succinyl CoA is an intermediate necessary for porphyrin, heme, and ketone body biosynthesis.  Regulation and inhibition  In some bacteria, the enzyme is regulated at the transcriptional level. It has been demonstrated that the gene for SCS (sucCD) is transcribed along with the gene for Œ±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (sucAB) under the control of a promoter called sdhC, which is part of the succinate dehydrogenase operon. This operon is up-regulated by the presence of oxygen and responds to a variety of carbon sources. Antibacterial drugs that prevent phosphorylation of histidine, like the molecule LY26650, are potent inhibitors of bacterial SCSs.  Optimal activity  Measurements (performed using a soy bean SCS) indicate an optimal temperature of 37 ¬∞C and an optimal pH of 7.0-8.0.  Role in disease  Fatal infantile lactic acidosis: Defective SCS has been implicated as a cause of fatal infantile lactic acidosis, which is a disease in infants that is characterized by the build-up of toxic levels of lactic acid. The condition (when it is most severe) results in death usually within 2‚Äì4 days after birth. It has been determined that patients with the condition display a two base pair deletion within the gene known as SUCLG1 that encodes the Œ± subunit of SCS. As a result, functional SCS is absent in metabolism causing a major imbalance in flux between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Since the cells do not have a functional citric acid cycle, acidosis results because cells are forced to choose lactic acid production as the primary means of producing ATP.

Peter's younger brother, Jason, also played in the NFL.  Early years  Peter grew up the oldest of four children in the Locust section of Middletown Township, New Jersey.  High school  Peter attended Middletown High School South, where he played one year of football as a junior. The team went undefeated and won the state title in 1990.  College career  Peter received a full athletic scholarship to the University of Nebraska where he was a three year starter. He became one of the leaders of Nebraska's feared \\"Blackshirt\\" defense. Peter was an all-Big Eight Conference and honorable mention All-American in his senior year, and finished his college career with 124 total tackles, 20 tackles for loss and nine sacks. He was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in 2006. Arrests and convictions While attending Nebraska, Peter had several run- ins with the law for various offenses such as threatening a parking attendant while his vehicle was being towed, trespassing, public urination, refusing to comply with police, minor in possession of alcohol, and failure to appear in court. He was convicted four times. [3][4] In 1993 Peter was accused of groping Natalie Kuijvenhoven (a former Miss Nebraska) in a crowded bar. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation, and was suspended for a 1993 exhibition game. Following the 1993 charges from Kuijvenhoven, Kathy Redmond, who attended the University of Nebraska with Peter, came forward and claimed that Peter had sexually assaulted her during their freshman year in 1991. No criminal charges were filed in the matter, but Redmond did file a Title IX suit against the University of Nebraska in 1995; the suit was settled out of court. In 1994, only a month before the draft, Peter was convicted of disturbing the peace after a woman accused him of grabbing her throat in a Kearney, Nebraska bar. He said he was under the influence during the altercation and admitted to responding in an inexcusable way after she allegedly called him a rapist. Professional career Peter was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL Draft. The pick set off a firestorm of criticism from the Boston area press, including Patriots fans and women's groups, as well as Myra Kraft, wife of Patriots owner Robert Kraft.[3] After learning more about Peter's history, the Patriots relinquished the rights to him only a week after the draft. The team said that Peter's behavior was \\"incompatible with our organization's standards of acceptable conduct.\\"[6] According to The Boston Globe, Myra Kraft personally demanded that the Patriots cut ties with Peter.[3] It was the first time in NFL history that a drafted player had been waived by a team before the start of training camp. Partly due to the backlash, no other team expressed interest. After the 1996 season, the New York Giants signed Peter as a free agent on condition that he go through counseling for substance abuse, attention deficit disorder, and anger management.[7] He apologized for his behavior while at Nebraska and still speaks about the Giants today as having saved his life. After four years with the Giants, he went on to play with the Indianapolis Colts and the Chicago Bears, where he retired in 2004. Post playing career Today, Peter speaks openly of his sobriety, past struggles, and those who have helped him along the way. He travels to schools, businesses, communities, rehabs, and correctional facilities sharing his story in hopes that someone struggling will be helped. Peter currently serves on the board of the Tigger House Foundation, a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization dedicated to achieving a positive impact by reducing the death rate of heroin and opiate addiction. Peter is currently residing in his home state of New Jersey with his wife and three children. In 2007, he started The Competitive Advantage Companies, a full service insurance brokerage firm based out of Red Bank, NJ.

It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state ‚Äî as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces. Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (Vicia cracca), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem. Several subspecies are recognized: * Vicia villosa ssp. ambigua (Guss.) Kerguelen (= ssp. elegantissima, ssp. pseudocracca) * Vicia villosa ssp. eriocarpa (Hausskn.) P.W.Ball * Vicia villosa ssp. microphylla (d'Urv.) P.W.Ball * Vicia villosa ssp. varia (Host) Corb. (= ssp. dasycarpa) * Vicia villosa ssp. villosa The species Vicia hirsuta is also called hairy vetch. Cultivation Hairy vetch is widely used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of atmospheric nitrogen. Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture are related to the crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season, leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production. Companion plant Organic gardeners often plant hairy vetch (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a companion plant to tomatoes, as an alternative to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting.Organic Gardening Magazine Alien or invasive species It is regulated in the state of Florida.

He started Specialty Records, noted for its rhythm and blues, blues, gospel and early rock and roll music recordings, in Los Angeles in 1946. Career Born to a working-class Jewish family in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Rupe grew up in the nearby suburb of McKeesport. His father was a factory worker who had immigrated from Galicia, Austria and his mother was a housewife born in Pittsburgh. As a boy, he listened to music sung at a local black Baptist church. He attended college at Virginia Tech, Miami University, and UCLA. During World War II, he worked for a shipbuilding company in Los Angeles. Along the way, he changed his surname from Goldberg to Rupe, which was an ancestral name. Toward the end of the war, Rupe resolved to get into the entertainment industry. After losing money he had invested in a small record company, he spent $200 on what were called \\"race records\\" at the time to systematically analyze them and determine the formula for records that would sell. He decided that the secret lay in a big band sound with a churchy feel. He found the recording talent he needed in the many after-hours clubs in the Watts district. He and Ben Siegert first started Juke Box Records in 1944 and after a few hits, he broke with his partners and started a new company, Specialty Records. The label soon thrived with Roy Milton, Percy Mayfield, and Jimmy Liggins, along with a very successful gospel catalog. The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert \\"Bumps\\" Blackwell, and J. W. Alexander. Johnny Vincent was a sales representative for the company. Rupe had a love of gospel music, and in 1947 he began recording gospel quartets such as the Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Pilgrim Travelers, Alex Bradford, Dorothy Love Coates and Sister Wynona Carr. His taste for gospel carried over into secular music and influenced his choice of artists to record, such as Guitar Slim, Don and Dewey, Lloyd Price, Larry Williams, and Little Richard. It led him to value feeling over technique in the recording studio. Concerns about religious objections to the secularization of gospel music, combined with a contract dispute, resulted in his decision not to put out a pop record with gospel singer Sam Cooke. He recorded but ultimately chose not to release two songs that later became big hits, \\"You Send Me\\" and \\"Summertime\\". In 1952, Rupe first traveled to New Orleans because of his attraction to the gospel sound of Fats Domino who played piano in the band of Dave Bartholomew, a former trumpeter with Duke Ellington. It was on this trip that he auditioned and then recorded Lloyd Price. Rupe obtained his most successful artist when Little Richard, then a little-known recording artist, followed Lloyd Price's suggestion and sent Rupe a demo record. Art sent Blackwell to New Orleans to do a recording session. During a recording break Little Richard sang an obscene song while playing the piano. Blackwell sensed that it was a hit, but after the lyrics had been cleaned up, there was no time to teach the song to a piano player. So Little Richard both played and sang the only song to emerge from that first session, done in just three takes, \\"Tutti Frutti\\", one of the most significant rock and roll records ever made. Rupe also recorded Guitar Slim, with a young Ray Charles on piano. In addition, Specialty issued some of wildest R&B; records, such as \\"Cherokee Dance\\", by Froggy Landers; \\"(Everytime I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone\\", by Roy Montrell; \\"Drunk\\" by Jimmy Liggins; and the rock & roll \\"Moose on the Loose\\", by Roddy Jackson. When asked why Specialty was so successful, Rupe credited his own ability to produce rather than his business skills. In the early 1960s, he stopped producing records but remained active in the music business as a publisher. He returned during the fifties revival period in the late 1960s but only to reissue landmark recordings of the R&B; era. Rupe sold Specialty to Fantasy Records in 1991. The contracts that were given to the artists to sign left Rupe and others at the label with full ownership and publishing rights of the music. Richard signed a contract with Specialty Records in 1955. He reportedly gave the label full ownership of all the music he recorded with them in return for 50% of the royalties earned. In his authorized biography, he states that he sold his publishing rights to ‚ÄúTutti Frutti‚Äù for $50, leaving him with a small half- cent royalty rate per record sold. In 1959, Little Richard left the label and filed a lawsuit claiming he never received his royalties. He settled for $11,000 and waived his rights to royalties from such hits as ‚ÄúTutti Frutti‚Äù and ‚ÄúLong Tall Sally‚Äù. During the 1960s and later, Rupe became increasingly involved in oil and gas investments. Success in this area allowed him to establish the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, a philanthropy based in Santa Barbara. He turned 100 in September 2017. Honours  In 2007, Rupe was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. On December 15, 2010, it was announced that Rupe will be awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award (along with former Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Google.com/hostednews ReferencesExternal links * Marv Goldberg's R&B; Notebooks * Pittsburgh Music History article on Art Rupe Category:1917 births Category:Living people Category:American centenarians Category:American Jews Category:American music industry executives Category:Record producers from Pennsylvania Category:Miami University alumni Category:People from Greensburg, Pennsylvania Category:People from McKeesport, Pennsylvania ","title":"Art Rupe"},{"id":"4157299","text":"Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South () is the full title of the English translation of the novel written by the French science-fiction author Jules Verne, and centers on the story of James Burbank, an antislavery northerner living near Jacksonville, Florida, and Texar, a pro-slavery southerner who holds a vendetta against Burbank. Originally published in France in 1887, the book received a tepid reaction upon its release in the United States, partly because of Verne's inexpertise regarding some details of the American Civil War, and has since fallen into obscurity compared to many of Verne's other works. Plot summary Texar and Burbank are bitter enemies, Burbank's northern view of slavery as an evil being an unpopular stance with Texar and the rest of the community, deep in the Confederate States of America. On top of this disagreement, though, Texar is angry at Burbank for past legal troubles Burbank has brought upon Texar, and, despite Texar inventing a perfect alibi that allows him to escape conviction, Texar feels the need for vengeance and eventually becomes a prominent and powerful member of the Jacksonville community. Using this newfound power, Texar turns the townsfolk against Burbank and leads a mob that destroys the Burbank plantation, known as Camdless Bay. Burbank's daughter Dy and caretaker Zermah are both kidnapped by a man claiming to be Texar and are purportedly taken to a place in the Everglades called Carneral Island. En route, and after enlisting the help of the United States Navy, they find a separate group searching for Texar in response to crimes that apparently happened in the same time as the ones at Camdless Bay but in a distant location. This opens up the realization that there is one real Texar and one who is not, and the search continues now, not only for Dy and Zermah, but for the answer to this mystery. Publication history Nord Contre Sud, the original French title of the book, was first published in its fully illustrated edition in November, 1887, by J. Hetzel et Cie, Paris. In the first American (and first English) translation, Nord Contre Sud (North Against South) was relegated to a subtitle and the book's title was made Texar's Vengeance, quickly re-translated as Texar's Revenge. This edition was published by George Munro, New York (1887), a translation by Laura E. Kendall as part of the \\"Seaside Library\\". Since then, however, there have been more minor variations on the title, some editions referring to the title as \\"The Texar's Revenge\\", others omitting the title completely in favor of the more simple \\"North Against South\\". The most common and generally most accepted American version of the title is the full \\"Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South\\". There have also been a handful of editions that have split the book into two volumes, those being \\"Burbank the Northerner\\" and \\"Texar the Southerner\\", both of which are contained in most editions of the book. Various cheap editions were published in the U.S. for the next 20 years by W. L. Allison, Hurst, and others. The first fully illustrated edition in English was North against South published by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, London, December 1887. This is a different anonymous translation from the one published by George Munro. In 2007 the first fully illustrated edition of North against South in the U.S. was published by the Choptank Press of St. Michaels, Maryland as a Lulu Press book,ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/Verne-COLLECTOR-1.htm a replica re- publication of the Sampson Low first edition. printed by Lulu Press Quote [In Jules Verne's] story of \\"Texar\\"... a very thin streak of narrative is padded to almost unwieldy proportions by a quantity of remarkably inaccurate information about the rebellion.

His most recent position was as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Western Illinois University, a small college football program, but received attention for his aggressive style of play. Although Cox was a relatively late fifth-round pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1991 NFL Draft, he rose to prominence as a standout linebacker during his twelve NFL seasons from 1991 through 2002. He was a three-time pro bowler with the Miami Dolphins, and was also a member of the New England Patriots club that won Super Bowl XXXVI. High school and college Cox was a member of the East St. Louis High School Flyers high school football team, where he was coached by Bob Shannon.

As a senior, he was named as a first- team All-America selection by the Football Gazette and was a first-team all- conference selection. As a junior, he was named the Western Illinois Most Valuable Player. As a sophomore, Cox played in every game, and finished his sophomore season with 54 tackles, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions and three blocked kicks. As a freshman, Cox was a reserve nickel-back and finished the season with 30 tackles. Professional playing career Cox was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, chosen 113th overall. As a rookie, Cox started 13 games as the Dolphins right outside linebacker, racking up a total of 61 tackles along with two sacks. Miami finished out the season 8-8. In his sophomore campaign, Cox blossomed and helped lead the Dolphins to an 11-5 record and the AFC Championship Game. He made his first Pro Bowl and was named to the All Pro team after recording 127 tackles, 14 sacks and five forced fumbles.Bryan Cox NFL Football StatisticsPro Football-Reference.com Miami switched to a 4-3 defense in 1993 and Cox was moved to right linebacker.

Overall, Cox spent five years with the Dolphins playing both outside and middle linebacker, starting 75 out of a possible 78 games. While with Miami, Cox made his distaste towards division rival Buffalo widely known, giving the finger towards fans in 1993 and getting into a fist-fight with Bills fullback Carwell Gardner in 1995. Cox would go on to play seven more seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints. In a career encompassing 165 games, Cox recorded 764 tackles, tallied 51.5 quarterback sacks, caught four interceptions and forced 22 fumbles. Among his most famous plays was a 27-yard interception-return touchdown against the Patriots in September 1999 while playing with the Jets; another famous play came with the Patriots in September 2001 in a game against the Indianapolis Colts; Cox hit receiver Jerome Pathon in the first quarter, a hit that briefly knocked Pathon out. Throughout his NFL career, Cox was easily recognizable on the field due to the unusual headrest- or \\"surfboard\\"-style neck roll he wore and colored to match his uniform jersey.PRO FOOTBALL: NFL; Glory Has Faded for the Neck Roll; Memories Have Not - New York Times Post-playing career From 2004-2005 he worked as an analyst for TVG Network.

Ideas involved in this model include: * That children learn through reward and punishment, as in operant conditioning. Corporal punishment, such as spanking, is favored in this model relative to other models. * That children become more self-reliant and more self-disciplined by having strict parents. * That the parent, particularly the father, is meant to mete out rewards for good behavior as well as punish bad behavior. This model of child-rearing would involve, for example, allowing children to cry themselves to sleep on the grounds that picking up a child when it should be sleeping on its own improperly fosters dependence on the parents. In his book Dare to Discipline, James Dobson advocates the strict father model. However, some researchers have linked authoritarian childrearing with children who withdraw, lack spontaneity, and have lesser evidence of conscience. The strict father model is discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including Moral Politics, Don't Think of an Elephant, The Political Mind, and Whose Freedom?. In these books, the strict father model is contrasted with the nurturant parent model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then conservative politics correspond to the strict father model. For example, conservatives think that adults should refrain from looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent. References *The Nation as Family. Rockridge Institute.

Rolling Thunder was the park's first wooden coaster and opened in 1979 during the park's fifth anniversary season. It closed in 2013 to make room for the construction of Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom, which opened in 2014. History Rolling Thunder opened in 1979. To mark the 100th anniversary of roller coasters in the USA, Rolling Thunder's Coaster 2 side was renamed Rednuht Gnillor, the backwards spelling of \\"Rolling Thunder\\", in 1984. The trains were turned around so that riders could view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so that riders could see them. Rolling Thunder was standing but not operating in September and October 2005 and through most of spring 2006 because of the construction of the Plaza del Carnival section and El Toro. Rolling Thunder closed on September 8, 2013, to make room for Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom. Soon after closure, it was demolished, except for one short part of double trackage which is still standing today. You can find it underneath a section of El Toro, which is now dubbed the \\"Rolling Thunder\\" hill.  Ride experience = Queue  The line for the ride began at an adjoining entrance and had separate queues for each track. The queue to the right of the entrance lead to the Coaster 1 track and Coaster 2 was reached by the queue on the left. Guests who were not tall enough for coasters with 54-inch (137 cm) minimum height rode Rolling Thunder, which had a 44-inch (112 cm) height requirement.  Layout  Unlike most racing coasters, Rolling Thunder's tracks were not always next to each other, they separated at several points in the ride. After the first drop, the left track traveled over a big hill, followed by a small hill, whereas the second track reversed that. On the turnaround at the back, the left track traveled up and made a level turn, while the right track traveled up and dropped while turning. The hills on the return segment were also staggered. The trains were not always raced. Track Viper is on the right) The structure and track were mostly built from 850,000 feet (259,080 m) of Douglas fir. In the past, the Douglas fir had been treated with pesticides which were not considered environmentally friendly and the track and supports were slowly being replaced with southern yellow pine. The track was made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of southern yellow pine, which sat on top of five layers of Douglas fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A strip of steel was bolted onto the top layer of wood track and three-inch-wide pieces of steel were bolted onto the sides. =Brakes= Rolling Thunder used skid brakes to stop the trains rather than modern fin brakes. The trains had brake pads underneath each car which slid against the brakes to lift the train's wheels off the track. The brakes were always in the up position unless the operator, in conjunction with the rear unloader attendant, advanced a train. The road wheels were heard spinning at the end of the ride and continued to spin until the operator, in conjunction with the unload attendant, advanced the train. There were three sets of brakes. The trim and ready brakes were located in the tunnel at the end of the ride. The trim brake slowed and stopped the train and served as a holding place for one train until the second train left the station. The train was advanced off the trim and onto the ready brake. The ready brake held the train until the second train reached the top half of the lift hill. The dispatch brake held the train in the station while it was being unloaded and loaded for the next ride. The trains were stopped manually and were not always aligned with the queue stalls in the station. Therefore, the attendants had to direct the guests to their rows from time to time before the airgates were opened. When the brake pads and wheels were wet, there was little friction to stop the trains and they slid too far onto the brakes. For safety reasons, only one train ran per side in rainy weather. Trains There were four trains that were distinguishable by color: red, blue, yellow and green. Each train had four three-bench Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters cars held together by hitch bars. Each car contained six seats. Each train held a maximum of 24 riders. The trains used buzz bars that locked in one position. Seat dividers and headrests were added in 1981 to prevent people from standing on the ride while it was in operation. Seat belts were added on the ride's 30th anniversary. There were three types of wheels used on the trains. Sixteen road wheels rode on the steel layer on top of the track. Sixteen guide wheels guided the trains around the turned on a separate steel track located on the sides of the wooden track. Sixteen upstop wheels rode on the bottom of the track.  Accident  On August 16, 1981, a 20-year-old park employee from Middletown, New Jersey, fell from the coaster to his death during a routine test run. An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that he may not have secured himself with the safety bar. A park representative later confirmed this conclusion, saying that the employee \\"may have assumed an unauthorized riding position that did not make use of safety restraints\\". The ride was inspected and the Labor Department concluded that the ride was \\"operationally and mechanically sound\\".

In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive . The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on parenting style. The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both \\"roots in the ground and wings to fly.\\" He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings). The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence. As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges. At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground through managed exercise of the child's own self- discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally. The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.' Other ideas: * True discipline is much more than strict, unquestioning obedience. Mutual respect and compassion are also rights. * The outside world is no more inherently hostile than it is inherently friendly; stay alert, the world commands respect * Mutual respect and compassion is best taught by example.  Research  This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in Human Development where researchers were investigating the parenting style preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the authoritative style. The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called \\"the nurturing parent\\" that focuses on responsibility, empathy, and creativity. The basic approach these parents used was to: * Trust in their children's fairness and good judgment * Respect their children's autonomy, thoughts and feelings * Support their children's interests and goals * Enjoy their children's company * Protect their children from doing injury to self or others, not by establishing rules but by communicating values and discussing their children's behavior with them * Modeling the self-control, sensitivity and values they believe their children will need  Further mentions  In his unfinished book, Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting, clinical social worker Herbert Jay Rosenfield encourages use of the acronym \\"RECEPEE\\", for \\"Reasonable Expectations, Clearly Expressed, Performed Everyday and by Example\\". \\"The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!\\" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym \\"UCARE\\": * Uniqueness that is positive, achieved through praise, encouragement, and positive feedback * Connectiveness to family, to extended family, and to a neighborhood that is safe, healthy and moderate * Age- appropriate autonomy: responsibilities and privileges that parallel their age and capabilities * Role Examples: parent models with good self-esteem and behavior, whom they can emulate Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that \\"parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment\\". The nurturant parent model is also discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including Moral Politics and Whose Freedom? In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the strict father model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then progressive politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance. The model is also consistent with slow parenting in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely.

Whilst holding the rank of \\"Captain and Lieutenant Colonel\\" he spent three months (from 2 April until 16 July 1863) in North America, travelling through parts of the Confederate States of America and the Union. Contrary to popular belief, Colonel Fremantle was not an official representative of the United Kingdom; instead, he was something of a tourist. Early life and career Fremantle was born into a distinguished military family; his father, Lieutenant-General John Fremantle, had commanded a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and had served during the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, as well as acting as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke during the abortive British invasion of Buenos Aires in 1807. Arthur's middle name, Lyon, came from his mother, Agnes Lyon.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. He was called \\"Arthur\\" after the Duke of Wellington, who had been the first witness at his parents' wedding in 1829. After his graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Arthur Fremantle was commissioned into the British Army in 1852, serving firstly as an ensign in the 70th Foot, before being transferred to the 52nd Foot almost immediately thereafter. The following year, Fremantle became ensign and lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and continued to receive promotions until, in 1860, at the age of 25, he held the rank of captain of his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army. The same year, Fremantle was appointed to the position of assistant military secretary at Gibraltar under Governor William John Codrington. In January 1862, the Confederate commerce raider CSS Sumter, pursued by the Union Navy, arrived in port. The ship's commander, Raphael Semmes, sought to have his ship repaired and refitted, although ultimately the Sumter was sold and its crew transferred to the newly constructed CSS Alabama. Sometime in early 1862, the young British captain met the flamboyant Confederate captain, and was inspired by Semmes' tales of blockade running and combat on the high seas.Campbell (2003), p. 118 Like many other officers of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable interest in the American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to take a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface: On 2 March 1863, Captain and Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the mail steamer Atrato.Fremantle (1864), p. 5 Traveling through Texas Fremantle entered the Confederacy through the Mexican town of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on 2 April on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Immortalit√© to avoid being in violation of the Union blockade, and crossed the Rio Grande into Brownsville, Texas.Fremantle (1864), p. 6 Within three hours of his arrival in the Confederacy, Fremantle encountered 'frontier justice' for the first time, finding the body of a renegade, known as Montgomery, half- buried and stripped of flesh at the roadside. Spending almost two weeks in Brownsville, with occasional visits across the border to Matamoros and the village of Bagdad, Fremantle became acquainted with General Hamilton P. Bee and several merchants and diplomats who were facilitating the trade of cotton across the border with Mexico. Part of the reasoning for Fremantle's tenure in Brownsville may have been that he wished to meet General John B. Magruder, for whom he had a letter of introduction.Fremantle (1864), p. 7 However, Magruder was delayed, and Fremantle left Brownsville on 13 April in a carriage in the company of some of his merchant friends. Their driver and his assistant, Mr Sargeant and Judge Hyde, are particularly memorable figures from Fremantle's diary, in no small part due to Fremantle's astonishment that a member of the justiciary should be working on a stagecoach.Fremantle (1864), p. 17 Later, General Longstreet would recall meeting the same two men during his own service in Texas.Fremantle (1864), p. 27 After finally meeting with General Magruder shortly after leaving Brownsville, Fremantle continued his journey across the Texan desert, dutifully recording in his diary his observations about the taste of polecat,Fremantle (1864), p. 26 the snuff habits of Texan women, and allusions to the coarse language of his drivers and travelling companions. He finally arrived in San Antonio, Texas, on 24 April, where he sold most of his luggage, and from there travelled to Houston, Texas, where he arrived on 30 April.Fremantle (1864), p. 34 Here, he dined with General William Read Scurry, and observed that those Confederate officers he encountered were extremely complimentary about Great Britain and the Queen, even proposing toasts to her health and to the Empire.Fremantle (1864), p. 35 Fremantle now proceeded with haste across the remaining Texan countryside, as rumours concerning the fate of Alexandria, Louisiana began to reach him.Fremantle (1864), p. 40 Furthermore, the continuing siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, was another source of anxiety, as the capture of the city would make passage across the Mississippi River practically impossible.Fremantle (1864), p. 42 Setting off for Galveston, Texas, on 2 May, Fremantle found himself meeting Sam Houston, the father of Texan independence, though he found the elder statesman to be vain and egotistical, as well as bitter and uncouth in his mannerisms.Fremantle (1864), p. 40 This occurred less than three months before Houston's death, presumably making Fremantle one of the last foreign visitors to meet the general. The English observer finally left Texas on 8 May, arriving in Shreveport, Louisiana, and partaking of the hospitality of General Edmund Kirby Smith and his wife.Fremantle (1864), p. 43 From Louisiana to Tennessee On the advice of General Kirby Smith, Fremantle made his way to Monroe, Louisiana, to attempt to cross the river from there due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of Alexandria. By the morning of 10 May, the day Fremantle's stagecoach arrived at its destination, travellers began to report that the city had fallen. In Monroe itself, Fremantle learned of the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville, although the news was accepted by locals without excitement.Fremantle (1864), p. 46 The wounding of Stonewall Jackson, however, caused some distress. The high expectations of Southerners, and their contempt for their enemies, would be among the few major points of criticism made by Fremantle. After considerable anxiety on board a steamer on the Mississippi, Fremantle finally crossed the river and arrived in Natchez, Mississippi, on 15 May.Fremantle (1864), p. 50 From Natchez, Fremantle travelled to Jackson, which he reached on 18 May. As the city had been evacuated and attacked only a few days earlier, Fremantle was treated with some suspicion by soldiers and locals, who expressed scepticism that an English officer should be travelling alone through the South. One local, the gun-toting Mr Smythe, even went so far as to threaten the foreign visitor with execution should he be unable to prove his identity and credentials. Upon 'examination' by a mob in a hotel, Fremantle finally convinced a Confederate cavalry officer and an Irish doctor of his legitimacy, and was spirited away to meet General Joseph E. Johnston, who accepted the peculiar traveller into his company. Fremantle remained near Johnston for several days, learning of the death of General Jackson from his Chancellorsville wound.Fremantle (1864), p. 53 Fremantle's next stop was at Mobile, Alabama, which he reached on 25 May after an eventful journey by train, in which a railway engineer shot a passenger.Fremantle (1864), p. 66 After inspecting the defences of the city with General Dabney H. Maury, Fremantle briefly visited Montgomery, the former capital of the Confederate States, before arriving in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on 28 May.Fremantle (1864), p. 70 Here, Fremantle met yet more prominent figures, including Generals William J. Hardee and Leonidas Polk, and Clement Vallandigham, the leader of the Copperheads.Fremantle (1864), p. 71 Later, Fremantle also encountered Braxton Bragg, who supplied the Englishman with letters of introduction and passes, allowing him to travel to Shelbyville, which he reached the following day.Fremantle (1864), p. 75 Fremantle remained here until 5 June, inspecting troops in the company of General Hardee, his fellow Englishman Colonel George St. Leger Grenfell and the Irish-born General Patrick Cleburne.Fremantle (1864), p. 78 He also witnessed the baptism of General Bragg, and a small skirmish between Federal and Confederate forces outside the town, before leaving for Charleston the following day.Fremantle (1864), p. 90 On to Richmond Increasingly, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle became possessed of a desire to get to the Confederate capital, Richmond, and from there attempt to locate the Army of Northern Virginia, with whom he intended to journey for a while. From Tennessee, he travelled through Augusta and Atlanta, before arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, the birthplace of the war, on 8 June. The English tourist was keen to inspect the defences of the city, and remained there until 15 June, inspecting Fort Sumter and visiting Morris Island in the company of General Roswell S. Ripley, commander of South Carolina's First Military District.Fremantle (1864), p. 94 During this stay, Fremantle also met General PGT Beauregard, and a member of Captain Raphael Semmes' crew from the CSS Sumter, whom Fremantle had first met in Gibraltar in 1862.Fremantle (1864), p. 101 En route to Richmond, Fremantle passed through Wilmington, North Carolina, and Petersburg, Virginia, before arriving in the Confederate capital two days after leaving Charleston. On the day of his arrival, he was granted a meeting with Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin.Fremantle (1864), p. 105 During the audience, Benjamin assured Fremantle that British diplomatic recognition of the C.S.A. would terminate the war without more bloodshed, though the British officer was concerned about a possible Union invasion of Canada. Benjamin also complained to his guest about revelations about his gambling habits made by the former correspondent of The Times, William Howard Russell. Benjamin then took Fremantle to see President Jefferson Davis, with whom he spoke for an hour. From Fremantle's account, it is possible to conclude that the Confederate leaders may have been trying to impress their British visitor on the matter of diplomatic intervention, without real consideration of his lack of power to do so.Fremantle (1864), p. 107 Intent on finding Lee's army at the earliest opportunity, Fremantle visited the Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon on 18 June, where he was furnished with letters of introduction to Generals Lee and Longstreet. Leaving Richmond two days later, Fremantle came upon the division of General William Dorsey Pender on 21 June, and reached Lee's headquarters at Berryville a day later.Fremantle (1864), p. 115 Here, Fremantle met the individuals who would be his companions for the next two weeks. Among them were Francis Lawley, the Times correspondent who had replaced Russell, Captain Fitzgerald Ross, an Austrian cavalry officer, and Captain Justus Scheibert, a Prussian army engineer who had been sent to inspect Confederate fortifications by his government. The accounts of these four men present the most enlightening accounts written by foreigners of the Campaign and Battle of Gettysburg. Gettysburg Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle introduced himself to General Longstreet on 27 June, a crucial meeting since it allowed Fremantle to observe the advance through Maryland and Pennsylvania in close quarters to the General and his staff. As well as the other foreign observers, Fremantle also became well acquainted with some of Longstreet's staff officers, including Gilbert Moxley Sorrel, Thomas Goree, and the medical staff, Doctors Cullen and Maury. As a neutral observer, Fremantle was allowed to enter the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which was off-limits to most soldiers and officers on the orders of General Lee.Fremantle (1864), p. 121 On 30 June, Fremantle met the famous commander of the Army of Northern Virginia for the first time, and learned from Longstreet that General George Meade had replaced Joseph Hooker as commander of the Army of the Potomac. In the camp, Fremantle spoke to the staff officers about the likelihood of battle in the near future. The next day, the sound of artillery fire alerted the English visitor that the two armies had indeed met each other. According to Fremantle's diary, a spy, presumably Henry Thomas Harrison, informed the company that there was a significant concentration of Union troops around Gettysburg. Whilst talking to Union prisoners, Fremantle met General Ambrose Powell Hill, who complained of being ill.Fremantle (1864), p. 128 Later in the evening, when the Union forces had reformed on Cemetery Ridge, Fremantle climbed a tree to observe the last of the fighting, before consulting with Longstreet again about the following day's action. On 2 July, the four foreign observers returned to the battlefield at 5 am, in time to witness a meeting between Generals Lee, Longstreet, Hill, John Bell Hood and Henry Heth. Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree to see what was happening, this time in the company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2 pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4 pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes above the din of battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale.Fremantle (1864), p. 132 On the morning of 3 July, Captain Ross and Colonel Fremantle made an inspection of the town of Gettysburg itself, intending to get to the cupola of the seminary, which had been used by General John Buford as a vantage point two days earlier. The commencement of the Union bombardment stopped the two observers, and so they returned to Longstreet's headquarters early in the afternoon. Fremantle alone found the General sitting on a small fence. Thinking that the battle was just getting under way, Fremantle commented to Longstreet that he 'wouldn't have missed this for anything'. Longstreet wryly pointed out to his guest that the attack had already happened, and had been repulsed. Longstreet asked if Fremantle had anything to drink, at which the Englishman made a gift to the general of his silver hip flask.Fremantle (1864), p. 135 Coming upon Lee, Fremantle found him rallying the defeated troops, reassuring them and trying to rally them ahead of an anticipated Union counterattack. The Union counterattack did not come, however, and Fremantle retreated along with the rest of the Confederate Army on the night of 4 July. As the army fell back into Maryland, Fremantle met Jeb Stuart, the cavalry commander whose absence during the preceding battle cost Lee valuable intelligence. On 7 July, Fremantle took his leave of Longstreet and his staff, intending to cross the Union lines and make his way to New York City. A parting remark made by Major Latrobe did little to reassure him: 'You may take your oath he'll be caught for a spy'.Fremantle (1864), p. 144 Longstreet was more confident of Fremantle's abilities, informing his aide that, since Fremantle had managed to travel across lawless areas of Texas, crossing the Union lines would cause him little difficulty. Two days later, in Hagerstown, Fremantle left Lawley and Ross, and made his way towards the Union Army.Fremantle (1864), p. 146 Despite initial suspicion, Fremantle convinced General Benjamin Franklin Kelley that he was no spy, even showing the officer a pass from General Lee verifying Fremantle's neutral status.Fremantle (1864), p. 147 New York and the Draft Riots His passage having been secured, Fremantle arrived by train in New York City on the night of 12 July, booking into the Fifth Avenue Hotel.Fremantle (1864), p. 150 The following day, Fremantle went out for a walk along Broadway. Upon his return to the hotel, he found that shopkeepers were closing their shutters early, and then noticed that several buildings were ablaze. Fire engines were present, but the crowd was not permitting them to be used. Increasingly alarmed, Fremantle saw a black youth pursued by the mob, eventually finding refuge with a company of soldiers, to the disgust of the massed protestors. Bewildered, the Englishman asked a bystander why the crowds were so vehement in their hatred of blacks. In response, he was told that they were 'the innocent cause of all these troubles'.Fremantle (1864), p. 151 In fact, the New York City draft riots (13‚Äì16 July 1863), the most violent insurrection in the history of the US had begun, and were eventually to evolve into an anti-black pogrom. A day later, Fremantle noted that the activities of the mob were worsening, with battles between police and rioters now taking place in the streets. An English captain reported that the mob had forced their way onto his ship and beaten his black crew members, forcing a French warship to threaten violence against any attacks against foreign vessels.Fremantle (1864), p. 152  Return to England  On 15 July, amidst the violence and terror gripping large parts of the city, Fremantle boarded the SS China, and began his voyage back to Britain.Fremantle (1864), p. 155 Upon returning to England, the young Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle found himself being questioned by friends and colleagues on the truth of the situation in the Confederate States, as only Union newspapers were readily available in England. Suitably encouraged, Fremantle wrote a book on his experiences in America, Three Months in the Southern States, based on the diary which he kept throughout his sojourn in the South. Published in 1864, the book was well-received both in Great Britain and in the Union, and it was even printed in Mobile by S.H. Goetzel & Co., being eagerly read even by the beleaguered Southerners, who wanted to see how their struggle was being reported by a foreign visitor.Fremantle (1864), p. 1-158 Later life and career The front line in the Battle of Abu Klea, (January 1885), where (as at Tamai, 10 months earlier) the British infantry square was pierced by the Mahdist Fuzzy-Wuzzy rush. This almost photographic view serves to depict the self-control of the wounded British 'Tommy' reloading his Martini-Henry rifle, while his friend writhes on the ground, choking and hammering a dervish Fremantle married shortly after his return to Great Britain, and served with his regiment until 1880, when he was placed on half pay after 28 years of service without seeing any active duty. The following year, however, he was promoted to the rank of major general and assigned as aide-de-camp to Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, commander-in-chief of the British Army.Sorrel (1959), p. 160-161 The United Kingdom was upset by the disasters suffered by the Anglo-Egyptian forces contending with the Mahdist army in the Sudan (Battle of El Obeid; 1st Battle of El Teb). Fremantle was sent to the Sudan, temporarily serving as garrison commander at the port of Suakin. Fremantle followed General Graham in his inland raid when he intended to crush the Mahdist Osman Digna. Fremantle was in command of the Brigade of Guards and as such took part in the harsh Battle of Tamai. After the fall of Khartoum and the departure of the British from the Sudan, Fremantle stayed for a brief time in Cairo, then returned to England in 1886, serving in the War Office as Deputy Adjutant-General for Militia, Yeomanry and volunteers. In February 1893 he became Commander-in-Chief, Scotland, a post he held for less than a year. From the RYS terrace in Cowes castle, Fremantle certainly beheld the cutter Thistle training for the next America's Cup A plaque on the Victoria Lines in Mosta, Malta with a reference to Governor Fremantle He ended his career on a high note by being appointed to the office of Governor of Malta in January 1894. During his time on the island, Fremantle became a popular governor, presiding over political decisions such as the matter of mixed and non- Catholic marriages, and the issue of the payment of reparations to the Maltese ecclesiastical authorities from the Napoleonic Wars. In 1897, Fremantle renamed the line of fortifications that was under construction the Victoria Lines to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In November 1898, he hosted a visit to the island by the German Emperor, Kaiser William II, who arrived in Valletta on board his personal yacht, the Hohenzollern, upon which Governor Fremantle joined the Kaiser for dinner. In 1899, after his term in office ended, Lieutenant-General Arthur Fremantle returned to England. Fremantle was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John on 7 March 1900. A member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, General Fremantle died at the age of 65 in the Squadron's headquarters in Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight from complications of asthma on 25 September 1901. On the centenary of his funeral, a ceremony marking the restoration of his grave in Woodvale Cemetery, near Brighton, was conducted by his descendants and by Civil War re-enactors from the United States. Legacy Although the book was a best-seller at the time, the ultimate defeat of the Confederacy led to a sharp decrease in Britain of the appetite for Civil War diaries after 1865, including Fremantle's diary. In 1952, however, historian Walter Lord published a revised edition of Three Months in the Southern States, retitled The Fremantle Diary, which featured an introduction by the editor and detailed references.Fremantle (1954), p. 1-304 In popular media Part of the reason for the enduring fame of Fremantle compared to his fellow observers may be his role in Civil War literature and film, thanks to the success of Michael Shaara's historical novel, The Killer Angels. The novel, published in 1974, deals with the events of the Battle of Gettysburg and the effects of the engagement on some of the main protagonists, including Generals Longstreet and Lee, as well as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and General John Buford. Shaara's primary source material for researching the novel included the diaries, letters and correspondence of figures who were either involved in or present at the Battle.Shaara (1987), p. 1-345 In the 1993 film adaptation of Shaara's novel, retitled Gettysburg, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle is portrayed by James Lancaster. His character changes little from the book, once again engaging in important discussions with General Longstreet and his officers on the Confederacy's relations with the United Kingdom. However his appearance is substantially different from reality: in the movie he is shown in a scarlet British uniform sipping tea from a china cup, whereas, being in an unofficial capacity, he was dressed in a \\"gray shooting-jacket\\" and had been living rough like many others in the country.Fremantle (1864), p. 207 Since 1993, Fremantle has been portrayed in historical re-enactments in the United States by Roger Hughes, who also led the efforts to have Fremantle's grave in Brighton restored in 2001. Hughes maintains a website providing considerable information on Fremantle, his family, his travels and Civil War re-enactments.

History  Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 110th Street station. In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to stop at this station. Previously, the station could only hold six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street. In 2002, it was announced that 110th Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations.

An original protagonist on the series, Victor is introduced in the first episode as the preeminent mass media magnate of fictional Philadelphia Main Line suburb Llanview, Pennsylvania. Victor was originally and most notably played by actor Ernest Graves. Graves debuted July 15, 1968, and played the role until he left the series and last appeared in March 1974. Series creator Agnes Nixon and executive producer Doris Quinlan subsequently recast Victor to Shepperd Strudwick, who first appeared in December 1974 and played the role until the character's initial onscreen death in June 1976. Character background=Conception Series creator and then-scriptwriter Agnes Nixon originally created the character of Victor Lord based on her father, Harry Eckhardt. She crafted the role in an attempt to understand the reserved, domineering Eckhardt patriarch, an entrepreneur who financially thrived during the Great Depression manufacturing funeral garments. Casting and development Ernest Graves played the role from show's first episode in 1968 through March 1974. Shepperd Strudwick took over the role in December 1974, playing Victor continually through the character's onscreen death June 16, 1976. Tom O'Rourke briefly stepped into the role as a mirage in 1985, and Les Tremayne played the role of Victor in Heaven in 1987. Bill Moor and Terry Caza both appeared in the role in flashbacks from 1994 to 1995. The character was briefly brought back to life 26 years after his original death in January 2003, portrayed by William Stone Mahoney; the resurrection set the soap opera record for the longest span between a character's onscreen death and resurrection. Mahoney went on to play resurrected Victor through his second onscreen death in March 2003, reappearing as a vision for an episode in 2004. Storylines=1968‚Äì76 In the summer of 1968, Victor Lord (Graves) is introduced as the owner of Lord Enterprises founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Main Line newspaper, The Banner, serving the fictional town of Llanview, Pennsylvania. A widower, he is the domineering single father of daughters Victoria or \\"Viki\\" (originally Gillian Spencer) and Meredith or \\"Merrie\\" (originally Trish Van Devere). The family inhabits Victor's inherited family estate, Llanfair. His wife, Eugenia Randolph Lord, died while giving birth to Meredith and was, ultimately, unable to produce his desired male heir to his estate (a picture of her hangs above the mantle of the Lord library in early episodes). Victor thereby goes about grooming his eldest child, Viki, to assume the role of running the estate by hiring her as an editor for his newspaper. Victoria desperately seeks her father's approval and gleefully assumes the role of heiress to the family fortune. Victor eventually grows weary of Victoria's admiration for one of his star reporters, working class executive editor Joe Riley (Lee Patterson). In the early years, Victor is also unhappy at the growing relationship of his younger daughter, Meredith, with upwardly-mobile doctor Larry Wolek (Paul Tulley, Jim Storm). He meddles in the personal relationships of his daughters, causing a rift between him and Victoria. In November 1968, unable to reconcile her feelings for Joe and for her father, Victoria develops multiple- personality disorder, manifesting in an alter-ego, \\"Niki Smith,\\" and begins dating Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini). As Victoria recovers from her first bout with multiple personalities, Victor concedes to the relationships of his white collar daughters to working class gentlemen when he uncovers that he had a long-lost son. Victor embarks on a search for the son he had long yearned for. Viki and Joe first marry in December 1969, and Merrie (Lynn Benesch onward) and Larry (Michael Storm onward) in June 1970. A short time later, Joe apparently dies in a car crash while reporting in California, giving Victor the opportunity to set his widowed daughter up with a suitor more to his liking. With a vacant editor-in-chief position available, Victor replaces Joe with promoted upper-crust writer Steve Burke (Bernie Grant). In 1971, Victoria (Erika Slezak onward) announces her engagement to Steve, which her father approves of; Victor is, however, unhappy when he discovers his continually frail daughter Meredith is seeking to conceive a child with Larry. Merrie is prescribed bedrest and later gives birth to Victor's first onscreen grandchildren, twins (one which dies a childbirth and the other, a grandson named Daniel). In the summer of 1973, in the midst of Victor's search for his son, Meredith is held hostage in the Llanfair carriage house with brother-in- law Vinny when burglars try to steal Victor's prized art collection. A distressed Victor pleads with the robbers to release Meredith during hostage negotiations with Llanview Police Department Lt. Ed Hall (Al Freeman, Jr.). Meredith is viciously assaulted by the thieves, who are killed by the police, and later dies at Llanview Hospital. Victor is devastated by her death, and he (Graves) leaves Llanview in 1974 in search for his heir-presumptive son. Dorian (Pinkerton) after his first stroke, 1974 The hostage crisis of Meredith and Vinny in 1973 saw the introduction of newly minted Dr. Dorian Cramer (originally, Nancy Pinkerton), who Viki dislikes at first sight. Dorian, at first, dates Llanview Hospital co-worker Dr. Mark Toland (Tom Lee Jones), and in the midst of the romance on-the-job in summer 1974. Dorian is suspected of medical malpractice, and all of the hospital board of directors (except for Viki) vote to fire her. Dorian assumes that Viki's was the deciding vote to fire her and vows revenge. When Victor (Strudwick) reappears in December 1974 and suffers a heart attack, and an unemployed Dorian decides to use him to get even with the Lord family. Dorian becomes Victor's personal physician in 1975, and the two quickly elope in May. Soon afterward, Tony Harris (George Reinholt) arrives in Llanview, and Dorian quickly realizes he is Victor's long-sought son. Tony quickly becomes friends with Victor, and when Tony uncovers a diary from Viki and Meredith's mother, Eugenia, and realizing Victor to be his estranged father, to the chagrin of a greedy Dorian. Dorian connives and succeeds in creating a rift between Victor and his new son. When Tony and Victor learn of Dorian's scheme, Tony first confronts Dorian, who denies having done anything wrong. On April 30, 1976, when Victor begins questioning Dorian, the ensuing argument leads Victor to have a debilitating stroke which leaves him unable to speak or dictate alterations to his will. Determined to keep her Victor from speaking to anyone, Dorian brings him home and succeeds from keeping everyone away from him. Soon, Victor suffers a second stroke which sends him back to the hospital. Despite his attempts to speak to Viki, Victor apparently dies on June 16, 1976, and Dorian inherits half of his wealth. Postmortem In 1985, Viki commences celebrations of the 50th anniversary of her father's newspaper. During preparations for the celebration, Viki's goddaughter, Tina (Andrea Evans), happens upon a hidden door in the Llanfair library, leading to a secret room. While in the room, Tina stumbles upon a letter written by Victor addressed to Viki, telling of his affair and brief marriage with Viki's former college friend Irene Manning Clayton and the siring of his daughter Tina. When Tina divulges the revelations, Viki reverts to alter-ego \\"Niki Smith\\" and Tina, for the following year, embarks on a mission to gain what she believes to be rightfully hers as a member of the Lord family. Recovered, Viki later uncovers in 1988 that she had a daughter, Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), while under the hypnosis insisted upon by Victor and delivered by her longtime friend and brother-in-law, Larry. Megan dies of lupus in 1992. Viki engages in an extramarital affair in 1993 with writer Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes), who authors Victor's biography, \\"Lord of The Banner\\". While penning the book, Dorian (now, Robin Strasser onward) nervously plots to prevent its publication as Sloan's papers allude to Dorian's complicity in Victor's death, a tale which became a Llanview urban legend in the years following Victor's apparent death. Intrigued by Dorian's intense interest in the book, Viki implores the Llanview Police Department to investigate the circumstances of Victor's death. They comply, leading to the arrest (and conviction, after trial) of Dorian for Victor's murder. When Dorian is sentenced to death by lethal injection, con man David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) arrives in town in 1994, claiming to possess the alleged diary of Viki's late friend and Tina's mother, Irene. Later revealed to be a forgery, the diary claims dead Irene smothered Victor, exonerating Dorian at the eleventh hour. Soon afterward, an actual diary entry from Irene reveals she bore Victor another son, reformed rapist Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). When Viki learns of the initial forgery, Viki, still loyal to her late father, vows to send Dorian back to jail for Victor's death in 1995. Dorian then divulges the source of Viki's multiple personalities‚ÄîVictor had long molested his eldest daughter Victoria and her repressed memories of the molestation led to the creation of her initial alter-ego, Niki. Victoria then suffered a recurrence of her multiple personality disorder, subsequently releasing several new personalities, who accost Dorian and hold her hostage in Victor's secret room. Upon recovery, Viki comes to terms with her father's inappropriate behaviors. Because of the pain she had to endure and dark secrets that were revealed, Viki, who had once worshiped the ground her father walked on and idealized him, now has nothing but contempt, rage, and disgust at Victor's depravity and actions. Finally in 2003, following the arrival of Viki's long-lost daughter, Natalie (Melissa Archer), an ailing Victor (William Stone Mahoney) resurfaces. It is during this time when Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) marries Natalie in a plot spearheaded by Victor to kill his granddaughter and harvest her heart, as he was dying of old age and heart disease. Viki foils Victor and Mitch's plot, saving Natalie from impending death. Victor is again rushed to the hospital. Larry tells Victor's present children, Viki and Todd (Howarth), to say their final goodbyes to their dying father. Victor dies on-screen in March 2003, a month before a shocked Dorian returns to Llanview. In 2007, during the funeral of Asa Buchanan, Dorian and Viki are trapped together in Asa's wine cellar. The two argue and Dorian tells Viki that she, not Viki, killed Victor. Viki, flabbergasted, reminds Dorian that neither she nor Dorian had killed Victor because he had returned from the dead a few years before. Dorian then plants a seed of doubt in Viki's mind, responding \\"if that really was him.\\" During the episode first aired on November 26, 2008, Viki visits her father's grave, and the date of death shown is \\"June 16, 1976\\", the date of the episode in which Victor originally died. It was never mentioned onscreen whether or not the Victor who appeared in 2003 was an imposter, and the 2003 storyline is not mentioned again in the series, leading to speculation that it was simply retconned out of continuity. In 2011, it was revealed by a back-from-the dead Irene that the man known as Todd (Trevor St. John) since May 2003 was in fact his twin, Victor Lord, Jr. (St. John), and the real Todd Manning (Howarth) had been held hostage by her since his disappearance in March 2003. Victor, Jr. is later seemingly killed on the episode that first aired August 31, 2011. On the original finale January 13, 2012, however, Victor, Jr. is revealed to be alive and being held captive by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick). =A seed of doubt= During an interview with TV Guide Canada in February 2009, \\"Dorian Lord\\" actress Robin Strasser, offered a belated explanation for the recent reversal about Victor's murderer: The notion that Dorian is Victor's true murderer is bolstered in the August 16, 2011 episode of One Life to Live. When David Vickers Buchanan mentions that the (albeit forged) entry from Irene Manning's diary cleared Dorian of a murder she did not commit, Dorian comments to herself, \\"... or so Viki chooses to believe.\\" Reception From the outset, the original portrayal of Victor Lord by actor Ernest Graves was received as ruthless and overbearing, playing a role introduced as the powerful center of the fictional town of Llanview, and of the lives of his daughters Victoria and Meredith. For his portrayal of a dying Victor, actor Shepperd Strudwick earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1976. Leading series actress and onscreen daughter Erika Slezak reflected on Victor's transformation at the 25th anniversary of OLTL in 1993 recalling, \\"Once, Victor Lord was a paragon of virtue, then producer Paul Rauch said, 'let's turn him into a dirty old man who sleeps with young women and keeps pornography in the basement.'\\" ReferencesNotesExternal links *Victor Lord, Sr. profile ‚Äì SoapCentral.com *Victor Dalby Lord, Sr. profile ‚Äì The Llanview Labyrinth Category:One Life to Live characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1968 Category:Fictional reporters Category:Fictional characters from Pennsylvania Category:Fictional newspaper publishers (people) Category:Fictional pedophiles Category:Male characters in television Category:Male villains ","title":"Victor Lord"},{"id":"4157518","text":"3D model of a truncated dodecadodecahedron In geometry, the truncated dodecadodecahedron (or stellatruncated dodecadodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U59.

Related polyhedra= Great pentagonal hexecontahedron  3D model of a great pentagonal hexecontahedron The great pentagonal hexecontahedron (or great petaloid ditriacontahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron and dual to the uniform great snub icosidodecahedron. It has 60 intersecting irregular pentagonal faces, 120 edges, and 92 vertices. Proportions Denote the golden ratio by \\\\phi. Let \\\\xi\\\\approx -0.199\\\\,510\\\\,322\\\\,83 be the negative zero of the polynomial P = 8x^3-8x^2+\\\\phi^{-2}. Then each pentagonal face has four equal angles of \\\\arccos(\\\\xi)\\\\approx 101.508\\\\,325\\\\,512\\\\,64^{\\\\circ} and one angle of \\\\arccos(-\\\\phi^{-1}+\\\\phi^{-2}\\\\xi)\\\\approx 133.966\\\\,697\\\\,949\\\\,42^{\\\\circ}. Each face has three long and two short edges. The ratio l between the lengths of the long and the short edges is given by :l = \\\\frac{2-4\\\\xi^2}{1-2\\\\xi}\\\\approx 1.315\\\\,765\\\\,089\\\\,00. The dihedral angle equals \\\\arccos(\\\\xi/(\\\\xi+1))\\\\approx 104.432\\\\,268\\\\,611\\\\,86^{\\\\circ}. Part of each face lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models. The other two zeroes of the polynomial P play a similar role in the description of the great inverted pentagonal hexecontahedron and the great pentagrammic hexecontahedron.

Overview With a total development area of 173 km¬≤ (66.8 sq mi), the city is located along the coast of the Red Sea, around 100 km north of Jeddah, the commercial hub of Saudi Arabia. The city is also approximately an hour and 20 minutes away from the city of Mecca, 3 hours from Medina by car and an hour away from all Middle Eastern capital cities by plane. The total cost of the city is around SR 207 billion, with the project being built by Emaar Properties. A Tadawul-listed company created from Emaar Properties, a Dubai- based public joint stock company and one of the world‚Äôs largest real estate companies, and SAGIA (Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority) which is the main facilitator of the project. The city, along with another five economic cities, is a part of an ambitious \\"10x10\\" program to place Saudi Arabia among the world's top ten competitive investment destinations by the year 2010, planned by SAGIA. The first stage of the city is completed in 2010 and the whole city is planned to be fully completed by 2020. The city aims to diversify the nation's oil-based economy by bringing direct foreign and domestic investments. The city is also aspires to help create up to one million jobs. Upon completion, KAEC is said to be larger than Washington DC. It is being built along with 4 new cities in Saudi Arabia to control sprawl and congestion in existing cities. City components The city is divided into six main components: Industrial Zone, Sea Port, Residential Areas, Sea Resort, Educational Zone, and a Central Business District (CBD) which includes the Financial Island. Industrial Valley The industrial zone is estimated to cover 63 km¬≤, of land will be dedicated to industrial and light manufacturing facilities‚Äîidentified as key growth drivers for the Saudi economy‚Äîand can now host 2,700 industrial tenants. The jobs created estimated to be in industrial and light industries (330,000); research and development (150,000); business and office (200,000); services (115,000); hospitality (60,000) and education and community services (145,000). The \\"Plastics Valley\\" planned within the zone will use raw materials readily available in Saudi Arabia to produce high-end plastics used in automotive, biomedical, construction and food packaging industries. As of April 2016, 127 companies signed contracts to build and operate factories in the city. King Abdullah Port King Abdullah Port is estimated to cover 17 square kilometers, it will be the largest in the region with a capacity of over TEU20 million of containers per year. The first concession was given to National Container Terminal (NCT) and the operator is currently operating on four container berths. The port will have facilities to handle cargo and dry bulk, and will be equipped to receive the world‚Äôs largest vessels notably with its state-of- the-art Ship-to-shore cranes able to handle 25 containers across and the deepest draft in the region -18m. The port is the kingdom's first to be owned and funded by the private sector. The port serves as a linking passage between three continents, Asia, Africa and Europe. The port is considered an important part in the transportation network that connects between the contents and delivers goods to around 400 million people in the Middle East. In 2018, King Abdullah Port at KAEC had ranked second among the world‚Äôs fastest-growing ports. Residential areas The residential area is planned to include 260,000 apartments and 56,000 villas. It will be divided into smaller residential, commercial, and recreational areas. Parks and green spaces will be used extensively throughout the residential area. The area is estimated to be home for around half a million residents, and another ten thousand tourists. Each district would feature its own public amenities, such as mosques, shop and recreational venues. Sea resort The Resorts Area will be designed to feature services and amenities, hoping to draw both local and international tourists. Set to become a major destination on the map of Saudi Arabia and the map of the Middle East as a whole. It will include hotels, shopping centers and other recreational facilities. The number of hotel rooms and suites are proposed to be 25,000 hotel rooms in more than 120 hotels. Among the tourist draws at the resort is an 18-hole golf course, with training facilities and driving range. An equestrian club, yacht club and a range of water sports will also be constructed. Educational zone The Educational Zone is a part of plan to bring the Saudis capabilities and aspirations in technology to globally competitive levels. The Educational Zone is planned to consist of multi-university campus flanked by two Research & Development parks. The multi-university campus is designed to accommodate 18,000 students, and a 7,500 faculty and staff members. Central business district The central business district (CBD) is planned to offer 3.8 km¬≤ of office space, hotels and mixed-use commercial space. The Financial Island, within the CBD, has now been doubled in area to cover 14 hectares (35 ac) of land, which will be the largest regional financial nerve center for the world‚Äôs leading banks, investment houses and insurance groups. Developments KAUST under construction On June 12, 2008, King Abdullah visited the city and evaluated the progress. He also inaugurated projects and initiatives with a total worth of $35 billion (SR 130 billion). These projects include: * Science and Research Complex * Columbia University * Thunderbird University * Environment Protection Centre * Ethraa, The Smart City * Health Care City * KAEC Media City * The Cadre Technical City * EMAL International Aluminum Smelter factory * Total Oil factory * Holiday Inn Express Hotel * Ritz-Carlton Hotel & Resort The king also inaugurated the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). The university is 20 km away south of the city in the village of Thuwal. It opened in September 2009. According to the Saudi Real Estate Companion, 2015 was a key milestone for the project given the number of residential and commercial projects that were handed over. This was largely seen as a success given that total residential sales in 2014 and 2015 amounted to around 2,500 units. Emaar, E.C. and SAGIA have signed several memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and contracts with international and local developers in many fields. These developers include: * Orange Business Services, is trusted advisor to the project and will oversee the design of the Smart City telecoms services. * Ericsson, to supply, build, integrate operate and manage multiplay end-to-end fixed broadband network. * Cisco Systems, to design infrastructure for IT networks in the city. * GEMS World Academy, to design, build, and operate the first school in the city which will be opened by September 2009. * StrateSphere Enterprises and PolymerOhio, to develop KAEC Plastics Valley. * CEMCCO, to develop infrastructure for the Industrial Zone. * DP World, to develop KAEC Sea Port to be the largest in the Red Sea and one of the top 10 largest ports in the world with a capacity to handle 20 million TEU (twenty foot equivalent container units). * Mars GCC, to establish its own manufacturing facility in the Industrial Zone. * Capri Capital Partners, to develop a mixed-use project with a total worth of $2 billion (SR 7.5 billion). * Freyssinet Saudi Arabia, to develop the Business Park at Bay La Sun Village. * Saudi Binladin Group, to construct 16 residential towers within Bay La Sun Village. The towers are scheduled for completion in September 2009. * Siemens, to undertake the electrical transmission and distribution (T&D;) works for the first phase of KAEC. The work is scheduled to be completed by 2010. A house in Esmeralda Emaar, E.C has also launched two residential areas, Bay La Sun Village, and Esmeralda Suburb which includes a golf community. Both of the areas received an overwhelming response from investors. Bay La Sun is in itself a fully integrated community that includes several new initiatives including: * Raffles International School. * Bay La Sun Business Park. * Bay La Sun Hotel and Mall, which were also inaugurated by the king when he visited the city. Transport KAEC will be served by Al-Haramain High speed line. The construction of the station has been completed by 2018. On 25 September 2018, king Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud inaugurated the project.

Kaskaskia was launched 29 September 1939 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy; acquired by the Navy from Esso Oil Company, 22 October 1940; and commissioned 29 October 1940, Commander U.S. Gregory in command. Service history Kaskaskia cleared Boston, Mass19 November 1940 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 3 January 1941. She transported oil between West Coast ports and Pearl Harbor, making six cruises before 7 August, when she made an oil run to Johnston Island. The oiler returned to Mare Island 10 September for overhaul and repairs. In San Francisco when the Japanese made their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Kaskaskia immediately began preparations to join the Service Force in the Pacific. World War II Sailing from San Diego 6 January 1942, Kaskaskia commenced fueling operations en route before arriving Pago Pago 20 January. For the next six months she operated out of Nom-a refueling the ships engaged in the violent struggle to stem the Japanese advance. The oiler arrived Kodiak, Alaska, 3 July with a cargo of oil and fuel to be used in the Aleutian Islands campaign. She returned to Wilmington, California, loaded oil and aviation gasoline and continued oil runs to Alaskan ports until she steamed to Noum√©a late in March 1943. Kaskaskia supplied many ships, increasing the mobility of the fleet during the successful campaigns in the South Pacific. Kaskaskia returned to San Pedro 28 July for repairs before resuming her duties at Pearl Harbor 21 September. She transported oil between California and Hawaii until she sailed 25 November to support the Gilbert Islands campaign. Returning to Pearl Harbor 10 December, the oiler resumed her cruises between San Pedro and Hawaii. As the Navy pushed relentlessly toward Japan, Kaskaskia departed Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 to support operations in the Marshall Islands. After the Navy had captured the Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, Kaskaskia supported carrier task forces during their devastating raids on Truk, the Marianas Islands, and Palau Islands in February and March. The oiler continued fueling operations in the Marshall Islands area until she cleared Majuro 6 June to fuel destroyers and destroyer escorts in the invasion of Saipan. Throughout June and July Kaskaskia remained on hand, assisting the fleet to take Saipee, Guam, and Tinian ‚Äì important supply areas in the future campaign for the Philippines. As the Navy fought toward the Philippines, Admiral Nimitz decided to take the Palau Islands as a staging area for aircraft and ships during the invasion of Leyte. Kaskaskia departed Manus on 4 September with a task group bound for an assault on Peleliu. She operated in the Palau area until returning Manus 8 October. Her stay was a brief one, however, as she sailed 10 October for Leyte. Prior to the actual landings, she fueled units of the fleet, continuing this vital duty until a beachhead had been established. The oiler returned Ulithi 23 October and made another fueling run to the Philippine area early in November. After an overhaul at San Diego December 1944 through February 1945, Kaskaskia arrived Kwajalein 11 March to service the fleet. The oiler cleared Ulithi 30 March for the fueling area off Okinawa, the last major step before the Japanese homeland itself. Once again the oilers, the unsung heroes of the war, stood by refueling the many ships engaged in the irresistible assault from the sea on Okinawa. Kaskaskia was relieved of fueling duties off Okinawa, only to be summoned for another important service. She departed Ulithi 3 July to refuel units of the carrier task forces, launching raids on the Japanese Islands of Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç. When the Japanese surrendered, Kaskaskia steamed into Tokyo Bay 10 September with ships of the Occupation Forces. She continued refueling operations in Japan, China, and Formosa for an entire year before arriving San Pedro 28 September 1946. Korean War Between 1947 and 1950 she ferried oil and aviation gasoline from the West Coast to the Far East and naval bases in the mid-Pacific. When North Korean troops invaded South Korea, the United States accepted the challenge and ordered its forces to defend the embattled peninsula. Kaskaskia cleared San Diego 16 September to operate out of Sasebo. During October she entered the heavily mined waters off Wonsan, fueling ships blockading and bombarding that key port. During December she arrived off Hungnam to service ships engaged in evacuation operations in that area. Throughout the harsh winter months, Kaskaskia continued vital fueling missions between Japan and Korea. During the United Nations counteroffensive in the spring of 1951, she also stood by for fueling operations. The oiler returned to Long Beach, California, 27 August for overhaul and operations along the Pacific Coast. She sailed for the second Korean tour January 1952, arriving Sasebo on 22 January to refuel the ships engaged in the Korean War. In addition to services in Korea, she also supplied units in Japan, Okinawa and Formosa before returning Long Beach 31 July. Overhaul and training preceded her third Korean deployment from 27 December to July 1953. On this tour she supported ships engaged in fire support operations. Returning home 17 August, Kaskaskia underwent overhaul; she then sailed again for the Far East 4 January 1954, operated out of Sasebo and returning San Francisco 12 October. Following coastal operations, the oiler was placed out of commission, in reserve, 8 April 1955. Kaskaskia was transferred to MSTS 8 January 1957, and operated in that capacity with a Navy crew until 21 October 1957 when she decommissioned and was turned over to the Maritime Administration 10 December. Kaskaskia was struck from the Navy List 2 January 1959. 1960s The Berlin Crisis of 1961 necessitated the reactivation of ships and Kaskaskia was reinstated 8 September. Following overhaul and alterations she recommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, 6 December, Captain John D. Howell in command. After shakedown operations in the Caribbean, the oiler arrived Mayport, Florida, 1 May 1962. Throughout the summer she engaged in exercises off the Florida Coast, and sailed to the Azores to participate in Project Mercury, manned orbital flights. She was in company with during the latter's recovery of Astronaut Walter Schirra 3 October, demonstrating the large role of the Navy in space operations. Kaskaskia return to Mayport 22 October and two days later sailed to participate in the Cuban blockade. President John F. Kennedy ordered the blockade when the Soviet Union tried to plant offensive missiles only from the United States. The naval pressure persuaded the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles, easing the crisis. The oiler returned to operations out of Mayport 21 November. She cleared Mayport 5 February 1963, for a six-month Mediterranean cruise to refuel ships of the US 6th Fleet, then resumed refueling exercises off Florida for the rest of the year. During 1964 Kaskaskia engaged in fueling operations and exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean, constantly seeking improved methods to increase the mobility of the Fleet. On 6 January 1965, Kaskaskia sailed for another 6th Fleet deployment. While she was operating in the Mediterranean, her crew worked day and night delivering over 19,000,000 gallons of fuel to 169 ships. Kaskaskia returned to Mayport, 7 June 1965. She operated primarily along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean into 1967. Highlights of this period were service to ships patrolling off the coast of riot-torn Santo Domingo in the summer of 1965, and participation in the recovery team for an unmanned Apollo Program space flight in February 1966. Kaskaskia was decommissioned for the final time in December 1969 and sold for scrap in September 1970. Kaskaskia, received nine battle stars for World War II and seven stars for Korean War service.

History Thomas Manning, the first Englishman to reach Lhasa, visited Pagri from 21September until 5November 1811 and had this to say about his room in the town: \\"Dirt, dirt, grease, smoke. Misery, but good mutton.\\" Pagri was of some military importance in the early 20th century when it was occupied by the British Tibet Expedition under Francis Younghusband in 1904. The Pagri Fortress (Dzong) was located here and was important for the government as it stood between Tibet and Bhutan. Pagri was a staging area en route to Gyantse and ultimately Lhasa. During the summer of 1912, the 13th Dalai Lama met Agvan Dorzhiev at Phari Dzong and then accompanied him to the Samding Monastery, before returning to Lhasa after his exile in India. Thubten Ngodup, the current Nechung Oracle, was born in Phari in 1957. Environment 250px The houses are mostly made of Tibetan traditional stone and wood. The Pagri Valley lies in an alpine steppe zone on the south side, with an average annual temperature , and an extreme maximum temperature of . Annual precipitation is about , snow and ice melt forming rich water resources, shrubs and meadows development, a good place for the development of animal husbandry. Pagri is rich in minerals, wild animals, plants, and tourism resources. It is also a trading centre but due to geographical location is prone to natural disasters. Summer flash floods, mudslides, winter avalanches, snowstorms, etc. are common, and poor facilities makes it vulnerable to disaster. During the rainy season, water levels rise causing serious flooding, reducing soil quality and arable land every year, damaging the ecological environment and a threat to the inhabitants of Pagri. To the northeast of Pagri is Mount Jomolhari.  Climate  Phari Dzong in 1903 during British Younghusband invasion of Tibet Owing to its extreme altitude, Pagri has an alpine climate (K√∂ppen ETH) that is too cold to permit the growth of trees, even though the altitude is still marginally too low for the formation of permafrost. Example Mount Fuji in Japan, Uelen in Russia and Longyearbyen in Svalbard Norway. The winter is severe in spite of the fact that no month has daytime maxima below , and also very dry and long, extending as late as May. Snowfall, however, is rare because of the dryness. Summers, during which the great majority of precipitation occurs, are cool even at their warmest and consistently damp, even though the Himalayas prevent falls from ever being heavy.

There was a succession crisis after the premature death of Asclettin and Guaimar IV of Salerno, as suzerain of Aversa, tried to impose his candidate on the Normans, but they elected Trincanocte and he prevailed in getting Guaimar's recognition too. In 1047, he was present at a council with Pandulf IV of Capua and Guaimar, where the former was returned to his princely position and the latter's great domain was broken up.

Schaefer is an outspoken Christian. He has described himself as sympathetic to teleological arguments, but primarily a \\"proponent of Jesus.\\" Biography=Early life and education Schaefer was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was educated in Syracuse, New York; Menlo Park, California; and East Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was awarded a B.S. degree in chemical physics by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966, where he had the opportunity to work with scientists including George Whitesides, John C. Slater, F. Albert Cotton, Richard C. Lord, and Walter R. Thorson. He then received a National Defense Education Act Fellowship which enabled him to earn a Ph.D. degree in chemical physics from Stanford University in 1969. At Stanford he worked with Frank E. Harris on ab initio electronic structure theory and quantum chemistry. For his Ph.D. thesis work, he examined the electronic structure of first-row atoms and the oxygen molecule. He published 12 articles in journals including Physical Review and Physical Review Letters prior to defending his dissertation. Career Schaefer became an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, with access to Berkeley's Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600 mainframe computer. Through collaborations with other researchers, he also gained access to resources at the University Computing Company (UCC) in Palo Alto, which had a UNIVAC 1108. He worked at Berkeley from 1969 to 1987, with one exception. Schaefer spent 1979-1980 as the Wilfred T. Doherty Professor of Chemistry and inaugural Director of the Institute for Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin, before deciding to return to Berkeley. During his time at Berkeley, Schaefer published 375 papers and several books, including The Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules: A Survey of Rigorous Quantum Mechanical Results (1972) and Quantum Chemistry: The Development of Ab Initio Methods in Molecular Electronic Structure Theory (1984), a survey of research with commentary. In August 1987 Schaefer moved to the University of Georgia as Graham Perdue Professor of Chemistry and Director of the newly formed Center for Computational Chemistry. With the help of an IBM 3090-200E mainframe (as well as later models) he and his research group developed various computer-based methods for advanced quantum chemistry. Other academic appointments include Professeur d'Echange at the University of Paris (1977), Gastprofessur at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochshule (ETH), Zurich (1994, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010), and David P. Craig Visiting Professor at the Australian National University (1999). In 2004 he became Professor of Chemistry, Emeritus, at UC Berkeley. Schaefer became a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science (IAQMS) in 1984. He was elected president of WATOC (World Association of Theoretical and Computational Chemists) in 1996, and held the position until 2005. He is also a Fellow of the American Physical Society as of 1977, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science as of 2002, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as of 2004. As of January, 2020, Schaefer was the author of more than 1,600 peer-reviewed publications. A majority of these appeared in the Journal of Chemical Physics, the Journal of the American Chemical Society, and the Journal of Physical Chemistry.Journal of Physical Chemistry, A, Volume 108, No. 15, (2004), pg 2818 - 2840, List of publications of Fritz Schaefer, 1020 are listed to 2004. He was the editor of Molecular Physics for 11 years. He has directed 123 Ph.D. students, as well as many postdoctoral associates and visiting professors, now working at 42 academic institutions around the world. Research Research within the Schaefer group involves the use of computational hardware and theoretical methods to solve problems in molecular quantum mechanics. His contributions to the field of quantum chemistry include a paper challenging, on theoretical grounds, the geometry of triplet methylene as assigned by Nobel Prize-winning experimentalist Gerhard Herzberg; the development of the Z-vector method simplifying certain calculations of correlated systems; and a wide body of work undertaken in his research group on the geometries, properties, and reactions of chemical systems using highly accurate ab initio quantum chemical techniques. Many of these papers have predicted, or forced a reinterpretation of, experimental results. Awards and honors Henry F. Schaefer III, AIC Gold Medal, 2019 Schaefer was awarded the American Chemical Society's ACS Award in Pure Chemistry in 1979 \\"for the development of computational quantum chemistry into a reliable quantitative field of chemistry and for prolific exemplary calculations of broad chemical interest\\". The Pure Chemistry Award is given to the outstanding chemist in America under the age of 35. In 1983 he received the Leo Hendrik Baekeland award for the most distinguished North American chemist under the age of 40. In 1992, he was awarded the Centenary Prize of the Royal Society of Chemistry, London, with a citation that included \\"the first theoretical chemist successfully to challenge the accepted conclusion of a distinguished experimental group for a polyatomic molecule, namely methylene.\\"The Royal Society of Chemistry publication article: \\"Endowed Lecturers,\\" Chemistry in Britain, vol. 28, no. 9, (September 1992), 837. In 2003, Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Award in Theoretical Chemistry and the Ira Remsen Award of Johns Hopkins University. In 2004, a six-day conference was convened in Gyeongju, Korea on the ‚ÄúTheory and Applications of Computational Chemistry: A Celebration of 1000 Papers of Professor Henry F. Schaefer III.‚Äù Schaefer was honored with the $10,000 Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in 2005 by the University of Wisconsin's Theoretical Chemistry Institute, joining a distinguished list of some of the best-known scientists in the field. In 2011 Schaefer received the prestigious Ide P. Trotter Prize of Texas A&M; University. Previous recipients of the Trotter Prize include Nobelists Francis Crick, Charles Townes, Steven Weinberg, William Phillips, and Roald Hoffmann. In 2012 he received a Humboldt Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, and on March 29, 2012 he received the $20,000 SURA Distinguished Scientist Award, given to the outstanding scientist in any field in the 17 southern states of the US, for fulfilling SURA's mission of fostering excellence in scientific research. In 2013 Schaefer received the Chemical Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Chemists. On March 18, 2014, Professor Schaefer received the American Chemical Society Peter Debye Award in Physical Chemistry. In March 2015, Professor Schaefer was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Chemical Research Society of India. He returned to India to give his CRSI Honorary Fellow award lecture on February 6, 2016, at Panjab University in Chandigahr. Schaefer received the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal on May 8, 2019. Religion and science Schaefer is also an active Protestant Christian educator who regularly speaks to university audiences (over 500 to date), Christian groups and the public on science/faith issues. An expanded fifth printing appeared in 2008 In 2003, he published Science and Christianity: Conflict or Coherence?, a collection of essays and talks on the subject. A second edition appeared in 2016. He is a member of the Christian Faculty Forum at the University of Georgia. Controversy On January 25. 2008, Schaefer was invited to present a lecture entitled 'The Big Bang, Stephen Hawking and God' at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, during TECHFEST, Asia's largest technology festival. This evoked a response from a group of six atheist students in the form of handbills. Schaefer was, however, invited to return to IIT Bombay to present an Institute Lecture in February 2014. In 2016, Schaefer was again invited to present a plenary lecture at TECHFEST. His lecture on December 17, \\"The Life of a Scientist,\\" was presented to a large audience without incident. On December 14, 2018, Schaefer gave another plenary lecture at TECHFEST. There has been some controversy concerning the designation of Schaefer as a \\"five- time nominee for the Nobel Prize.\\" The original source of this estimate is a December 23, 1991 cover article from U.S. News & World Report.Jeffery L. Sheler and Joannie M. Schrof. 1991. \\"The Creation\\" U.S. News and World Report, Dec. 23, 1991, pp. 56-64. See inset quoting Schaefer and citing him as \\"quantum chemist and five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize,\\" p. 62. The names of nominees and other information about the Nobel nomination process cannot be revealed for 50 years following the nomination discussions, so such a designation is speculative.

Originally created in 1870, when Major General Richard Sankey was the then British Chief Engineer of Mysore state, it covered an area of and subsequent expansion has taken place and the area reported now is about . It has a rich recorded history of abundant flora and fauna plantations coupled with numerous impressive and aesthetically located buildings and statues of famous personages, in its precincts. Urban green spaces: Lungs of the city and centres of biodiversity educationCubbon Park This public park was first named as Meade‚Äôs Park after Sir John Meade, the acting Commissioner of Mysuru in 1870 and subsequently renamed as Cubbon Park after the longest-serving commissioner of the time, Sir Mark Cubbon. To commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar‚Äôs rule in Mysore State, in 1927, the park was again renamed as Sri. Chamarajendra Park, in memory of the 19th-century ruler of the state Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar (1868‚Äì94), during whose rule the park came into existence.http://www.horticulture.kar.nic.in/ Gardens Cubbon Park The landscaping in the park creatively integrates natural rock outcrops with thickets of trees, massive bamboos, with grassy expanse and flowerbeds and the monuments within its limits, regulated by the Horticulture Department of the Government of Karnataka. The predominantly green area of the park has many motorable roads, and the well-laid-out walking paths running through the park are frequented by early morning walkers and the naturalists who study plants in the tranquil natural environment. Tourists visiting this park in the city of Bengaluru have nicknamed the city itself as 'Garden City'.Cubbon Park The importance of the park to the city's environment is best stated by two urban architects who have won the national competition to design 'Freedom Park'. Access The park is accessible from M.G. Road, Kasturba road, Hudson Circle and Ambedkar Veedhi (Road). The motorable roads which run through the park are allowed for light motor vehicles only. All locations of the park are accessible through walking paths. The Park is open to the public at all times but the roads around the park are closed for traffic from 5:00 to 8:00 am every day to provide more safety and fresh environment for morning walkers and exercisers.The Cubbon Park Botanical assets Indigenous and exotic botanical species found in the park are about 68 genera and 96 species with a total of around 6000 plants/trees.

Other attractions at the Park are the Ringwood circle, lotus pond and bamboo grove nook. Historical buildings and monuments integral to the park The formal gardens, from the central hall of the original Attara Kacheri (means 18 government offices) now the Karnataka High Court, extends along the ceal promenade developed symmetrically with avenues, to the Museum building. Another impressive artistic structure is Iyer Hall, which houses the Central Library with a rose garden as a frontage. It is undisputedly the largest public library in the state as evidenced by the college students thronging to read here, and has the world's most extensive collection of Braille books. Other buildings located within or at the periphery of the park are 1) the Indira Priyadarshini Children‚Äôs Library, 2) the Venkatappa Art Gallery, 3) the Aquarium (stated to be the second largest in India), 4) the YMCA, 5) Yuvanika -- the State Youth Centre, 6) Century Club, 7) Press Club, 8) Jawahar Bal Bhavan, 9) Tennis Pavilion, 10) the Cheshire Dyer Memorial Hall and 11) the Ottawa Chatter.

Attara Kacheri  Originally Attarakacheri now the High Court of Karnataka in Bangalore at the entrance to Cubbon Park Attara Kacheri, built in 1864 A.D during British rule, is a stone structure in an intense red hue, a two storied building with Corinthian columns in Gothic Style of architecture and is located at the entrance to the Park. The Public offices (Secretariat of the Government of Karnataka) were located here from 1868 AD to 1956 AD, which were later moved to the Vidhana Soudha, opposite to it. The building now accommodates the Karnataka High Court. In the Central Hall a portrait of Sir Mark Cubbon decorates the ceiling. An equestrian statue of Cubbon by Baron Marochetti is located at the back of the building.Attara Kacherihttp://www.bangaloreindia.org.uk/tourist-attractions/attara- kacheri.html Attara Kacheri (High Court)  Museum  The State Archeological Museum, one of the oldest in India, built in 1876 by Colonel Sankey, located within the Park, is similar in design to the Attara Kacheri in its architectural style and hue. While the original collection in the museum belonged to Benjamin L. Rice of the Mysore Gazetteer, antiquities from Mohenjodaro period are on display in the Museum. Exhibits in the Museum include specimens of Vijaynagara and Halebid architecture, ancient coins and stone inscriptions as old as 5000 years.Cubbon Park Seshadri Iyer memorial hall Seshadri Iyer Memorial Hall, built in 1915 in a classic European style with Tuscan and Corinthian columns, in honour of Sir K.Seshadri Iyer who was Dewan of Mysore State from 1883 to 1901, is an impressive red building with gables. It houses the Seshadri Memorial library. The memorial building is ensconced in the middle of the park, framed by the greenery of the park and fronted by the rose garden. The Library has an area of 300 km and functions as the Apex of the Karnataka Public Libraries system, which is governed by State Library Authority. In the year 2000, the Library was awarded the Raja Rammohan Roy Library Foundation Award for the best state central library in India in recognition of its outstanding contribution to meritorious services rendered in the spread of knowledge and gearing up of library movement in the city of Bengaluru in particular and in the state of Karnataka in general. The library has presently a collection of 2.65 lakh books and also a Braille section.

Awareness campaign  The Centre for Environment Education (CEE), India, in the year 2006, embarked on a project to develop a brochure on the Park and involve the youth in several activities to help them to explore the park and through it, learn more about the wider environment. The brochure brought out as a joint effort of CEE, Department of Horticulture, AGRICULTURE PURPOSE That has been the most unique in the whole world that been a impressive area or the garden in the world Honoring Mark Cubbon After being largely ignored since Indian Independence in 1947, a large number of people have slowly started to acknowledge the pioneering work done by Mark Cubbon and other British administrators. On 23 August 2013, the statue of Mark Cubbon was garlanded for the first time since 1947, by Advocate S Umesh of the Cubbon Park Walkers‚Äô Association. The occasion was to mark the 238th birth anniversary of Sir Mark Cubbon. Special permission was obtained from the Karnataka High Court, and Police protection was provided. The group credited Mark for being one of the chief architects of Bengaluru and Mysuru. The move was however opposed by Vatal Nagaraj, infamous for vandalizing the Cenotaph Memorial near the Hudson Memorial Church. However, the association defended their move of honoring Mark Cubbon, as his contribution to Bengaluru was undeniable. Cubbon Park was renamed as Sri Chamarajendra Park way back in 1927, but the name was never popular, and people continued to call it Cubbon Park. Further, according to historians, it would be foolish to erase history, by trying to remove all symbols of British rule, and mere symbolism cannot lead to development. On 28 June 2020, the equestrian statue of Mark Cubbon was moved to the park grounds from the premises of Karnataka High Court.

It uses a .300 WSM (Winchester Short Magnum) case shortened and necked down to accept a .243in/6mm diameter bullet, and is a high velocity round based on ballistics design philosophies that are intended to produce a high level of efficiency. The correct name for the cartridge, as listed by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI), is 243 WSSM, without a decimal point.Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute Winchester has discontinued the manufacture of 243 WSSM ammunition. As of the first half of 2016, Winchester/Olin did manufactured and release for sale some WSSM ammunition. The product is only manufactured periodically, often on inconsistent intervals. Design The 243 WSSM is an addition to the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) family of cartridges, which also include the .223 WSSM and the .25 WSSM, and the idea behind the 243 WSSM was to develop a compact, higher velocity version of the well-established and internationally popular .243 Winchester unveiled by Winchester in 1955. The 243 WSSM was first introduced in 2003. The 243 WSSM's case is unusually short and fat in profile, contrasting markedly with most other rifle cartridges, and is intended to take advantage of what ballisticians have shown is the more uniform and efficient burning of propellant powder when it is held in a short, fat stack by the cartridge case.Guns and Ammo Magazine Short Mags Magic Or Myth Performance In their ballistics tables, Winchester list a very high muzzle velocity of with a projectile for this cartridge. Based on Hodgdon reloading data typical velocities should range from approximately with a bullet to approximately with a bullet. The percentage gain in performance over the older .243 Winchester is around 10% or less. This cartridge is usually used for small game such as varminting, and used for animals as large as deer. Advantages Compared to other factory 6mm sporting cartridges the 243 WSSM is capable of functioning in the AR-15.Olympic Arms 243 WSSM AR-15 Other factory produced 6mm cartridges like the 243 Win and 6mm Rem are both too long for the AR-15 and require the AR-10 platform. The 243 WSSM is shorter than the 243 Win, giving the 243 WSSM the ability to fit in a super-short action rifle. Thus 243 WSSM rifles can be lighter, have stiffer actions and have faster actions to cycle. The 243 WSSM gives generally a 10% increase in velocity over the 243 Win.

It is known for espousing the causes of Dalits, encouraging women's empowerment and taking pro-poor positions on economic issues. It has managed to maintain an independent position, despite an increasingly polarized media landscape in Karnataka. Prajavani uses the tagline \\"the most trusted Kannada daily newspaper\\", which appears below its masthead. Position in the market Prajavani was the leading Kannada newspaper for decades, until it was overtaken in circulation by Vijaya Karnataka (VK) in 2004. The gulf between PV and the upstart VK became huge for a while, but the two newspapers appear to be competing much more closely as of 2014, with PV having significantly recovered ground according to industry numbers. Some analysts have also attributed this to the launch of Vijaya Vani, by the original owner of Vijaya Karnataka, Vijay Sankeshwar and his VRL Group, which has apparently eaten into the readership of Vijaya Karnataka.

History  Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 103rd Street station. In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to stop at this station. Previously, the station could only hold six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street. In 2002, it was announced that 103rd Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations. Station layout This station was part of the original subway, and has two side platforms and three tracks, the center one being an unused express track. The southbound local track is known as BB1 and the northbound one is BB4; the BB designation is used for chaining purposes along the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to 242nd Street and not in everyday speech. Although it cannot be accessed at 103rd Street, the center track is designated as M. There is a mezzanine above the platforms, which contains the fare control area, as well as stairs to the street and both platforms. This is the southernmost 3-track station on the line. South of the station, there are switches that connect the express track to either local track, with trains then being able to crossover to the rising express tracks from the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. Under 103rd Street, the dual express tracks serving the southern part of the line descend and curve to the east to form the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. They turn off of Broadway and onto 104th Street directly underneath this station. An emergency exit from the Lenox Avenue Line is located in the middle of the northbound platform. Exits The station has four entrance/exit stairs that serve both platforms: * 2 on the NW corner of Broadway and 103rd Street * 2 on the NE corner of Broadway and 103rd Street A fifth, exit-only stair leads from the northbound platform to the SE corner of Broadway and 104th Street.

It is one of the Synod's two non-geographical districts, along with the SELC District. The district has congregations in the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The district has its origins in the congregations of the former English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States, which merged with the LCMS in 1911. The English Synod had been formally organized in 1888 out of the English (Evangelical) Lutheran Conference of Missouri of the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod.  History  Prior to 1839, a group of Lutherans of the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod moved from western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee to southeast Missouri. In 1872, a free conference was held in Gravelton, Missouri, with participants from that group, the LCMS, the Holston Synod, and the Norwegian Synod. The LCMS president, C. F. W. Walther, urged the Tennessee Synod members to organize themselves as a conference of the Tennessee Synod, the English (Evangelical) Lutheran Conference of Missouri. The conference applied for admission to the LCMS as a district in 1887, but was advised to instead form a separate synod because the LCMS was still a German-language synod while the conference used English. The conference therefore organized as the independent English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States in 1888. The English Synod was in full agreement with the LCMS on doctrine, and joined the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference in 1890. In 1911, with members of the LCMS itself becoming at least bilingually English-speaking, the English Synod merged into the LCMS. However, because it wanted to maintain its identity, it was accepted as a non-geographical district. Despite the transition of the LCMS to English, the English District has continued as a separate district. The English Synod operated two colleges, both acquired in 1893. In 1908, it gave St. John's College of Winfield, Kansas, to the LCMS. Concordia College of Conover, North Carolina, was transferred to the LCMS at the time of the merger. Both colleges were subsequently closed. The Lutheran Witness, the main lay-oriented magazine of the LCMS, was originally published, starting in 1882, by the Cleveland District Conference. The English Synod took over publication in 1888, and it became an LCMS publication upon the 1911 merger.  Current status  The district now includes approximately 159 congregations and missions in 17 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario, subdivided into 25 circuits, as well as 36 preschools, 15 elementary schools and one high school. Baptized membership in district congregations is approximately 48,600. English District offices are located in Farmington, Michigan. Delegates from each congregation meet in convention every three years to elect the district president, vice presidents, circuit counselors, a board of directors, and other officers. The district publishes its newsletter, English Channels, ten times a year. Bishops/Presidents * Rev. Henry Philip Eckhardt, 1911‚Äì12 * Rev. M. S. Sommer, 1912‚Äì15 * Rev.

It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin. It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is . 60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks. This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more. In 1933, it was donated to the Franklin Institute Science Museum. and remains there today. Testing After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons. Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades. In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q;'s own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption. On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q;, the AT&SF; compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad. In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal. Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being donated to the Franklin Institute. The locomotive was moved from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tracks at 24th and Vine Street over temporary tracks to the museum building which was then still under construction. The locomotive was placed in the building through an opening in the western wall.

Early life and career Richardson was born in Fairfax, Vermont. He was reportedly a descendant of famed American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam.Antietam on the Web; . He was appointed from Vermont to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He graduated 38th out of 52 cadets in the Class of 1841. He was one of 23 classmates who would become generals during the Civil War. After some routine assignments, Richardson served as a second lieutenant in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to first lieutenant on Sep 21, 1846. Wilson, James Grant; Fiske, John, eds. (1900). \\"Richardson, Israel Bush\\". Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography. 5. New York: D.

Richardson, promoted to colonel on May 25, 1861, was assigned command of the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, in the newly organized army of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell. His brigade saw limited action at the First Battle of Bull Run near Blackburn's Ford, and in covering the subsequent federal withdrawal to Washington. He was promoted to brigadier general, ranking from May 17, 1861.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2001. , pp. 452, 727 He commanded several brigades in the Army of the Potomac and then the 1st Division of the II Corps during the Peninsula Campaign in mid-1862. He was involved in the fighting at the battles of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. He was particularly distinguished in sharp fighting near the Chickahominy River. Richardson was promoted to major general after the Seven Days Battles. His division was stationed in Washington, DC, during the Second Battle of Bull Run and did not participate in that engagement. Richardson wound site. Richardson's 1st Division played a key role during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, attacking Confederate positions in the center of the Sunken Road in support of the 3rd Division of Maj. Gen. William H. French. After stubborn fighting, by 1:00 pm, Richardson had gained control of the high ground in front of the apex of the defensive line, and his men enfiladed the remaining defenders in the road, which would gain the nickname \\"Bloody Lane\\" for the carnage. Richardson pushed forward beyond the road and was directing the fire of his artillery and organizing another attack when he was struck by a shell fragment. Carried to the rear, Richardson was treated at a field hospital. His wound was not considered life-threatening, and he was given a room in Major General George B. McClellan's headquarters, the Pry House. President Abraham Lincoln paid his respects to the wounded Richardson during a visit to the battlefield in October. However, infection set in, and then pneumonia, which claimed the life of the popular general in early November. He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at Antietam. His body was escorted to Detroit. Large crowds lined the streets during his funeral procession to nearby Pontiac, where he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.

Mayor Wood defeated Democrat \\"Pug\\" Mabry, who served as mayor for over thirty years, in the election of 1997. During his election he ran on the platform of slow-growth, fighting urban sprawl and what he viewed as its negative side effects. At the time, he promised to only be a two-term mayor. He ran unchallenged and secured re-election in 2001. Wood is the son of Roy \\"Splinter\\" Wood, a Democrat, who was Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) during the Carter Administration in the 1970s.

Controversy=Letter to the FCC During the attempted merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, a number of politicians sent letters to the FCC expressing their support.. Wood was one of these, stating the merger would help spur business growth. It was later discovered that Wood had actually submitted a letter that had been ghostwritten by Comcast. Wood was just one of a number of politicians exposed by The Verge to have participated in such a practice. Term limits In 2016, Roswell resident Michael Litton filed a lawsuit accusing Wood of violating the city of Roswell's charter by seeking a third term as mayor. Wood, who was first elected in 1997, advocated in 2010 for the Roswell mayor to have a term limit of three four-year terms. He has said the intent was that the clock would start for him when the law was passed, and not when he was first elected. Although Wood had enjoyed the support of State Representative Betty Price, she has since stated that she does not intend to amend the charter to allow Wood to run for a subsequent term. She had been willing to support a charter change that would allow the mayor to serve out his term, but no more. \\"My goal has been to save the city the expense of a costly trial,\\" Price said. Since the start of the controversy, the city of Roswell has spent $16,843 through city attorney fees on defending Wood, as of mid-2016. On August 3, 2017, Wood was removed from office after a judge finding he did violate city law.http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt-- politics/roswell-mayor-jere-wood-removed-from-office-term-limits- case/Wt1Y5OYl4tHWTgFwRi1HoI/ Suit against Roswell In October 2016, Wood filed suit in Fulton Superior Court against Roswell and the Roswell Council Members over whether he could renovate his home. Wood's home is located in the Roswell historic district, which requites prior approval when renovating. He was initially granted approval by the Roswell Historic Preservation Commission to build a 1.5 story, 3,000 square foot house on his property. However, the city council later overturned the decision in August 2016. Wood alleged in the lawsuit that council members acted improperly by deciding the council had the legal authority to reverse the commission's earlier decision. State historic preservation laws allow \\"limited authority\\" for the council members to \\"approve, modify and approve, or reject\\" the historic commission‚Äôs final decision, but only if it is found that the commission abused its discretion.

Wickham was the World Champion for the 400 m and 800 m freestyle in 1978, and won gold in both events at the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. She is a former world record holder for the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle. Despite her success in the pool, Wickham has battled hardship and personal tragedy throughout her life. Swimming career Wickham began swimming at the age of eight at John Rigby‚Äôs pool in Brisbane and mastered her technique under the guidance of Peter Diamond. At the age of thirteen, she was selected to be on the Australian team for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games but failed to reach the finals at that meet. In 1977, Wickham‚Äôs family moved to California, where she trained for six months with coaching legend Mark Schubert. She returned to Brisbane at the end of 1977 and she came under the guidance of coach Bill Sweetenham at the Commercial Swimming Club. On 8 February 1978, Wickham broke her first world record, the 1500 m freestyle, in a solo swim at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, clocking 16:14.93. At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Wickham won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle. That same year, she set world records in both events, and won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1978 Berlin World Championships, setting a world 400 m record of 4.06.28, which stood as the Championship record until 2007. Both world records stood until 1987, long after her retirement. In 1980, Australia decided against an official boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. A number of Australian athletes elected to boycott the Games personally. Wickham maintains that she withdrew from the team because of illness, as she was suffering glandular fever at the time, not because of the boycott. The 800 m freestyle was won by fellow Australian Michelle Ford at that meet. Wickham retired at the end of 1979 due to financial problems. The policy of amateurism was upheld by the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia during this period, meaning Wickham could neither earn money from the sport nor receive any prizes. Wickham returned to swimming in the early 1980s under coach Laurie Lawrence. She won gold in the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she took the Athletes Oath at the Opening Ceremony. Her gold medal for the 400 m was presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II and Wickham retired from swimming immediately afterwards. Following the birth of her daughter, Wickham dived back into the water in May 1990, again with Lawrence as her coach, that year completing the 7.6 km open water race from Magnetic Island to Townsville, placing first in the female division. She also won the female division of the Lake Trasimeno 20 km marathon race. She retired for good following the birth of her son in January 1992.  Personal life  She was educated at the All Hallows' School, in Brisbane along with her sisters Julie and Kelly.Robson, Frank. (7 August 1999). \\"Cyclone Tracey\\".

The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928.O'Keeffe, Paul, ed. Tarr: The 1918 Version. Santa Rosa, CA: Black Sparrow Press, 1996, page 5 Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards‚Äîespecially in its English form‚Äîas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there \\"is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter\\". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis' own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler. The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier Egoist version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: \\"Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?\\" (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them. Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010.

Family  She was the daughter of Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282‚Äì1348) and his second wife Blanca N√∫√±ez de Lara de La Cerda. Her mother Blanca (d. 1347) was a descendant of the lords of Biscay and of Lara and of Alfonso X's eldest son, Fernando de la Cerda. She was the last legitimate member of the House of Ivrea.  Marriage  Her father had been for five years a serious enemy of King Alfonso XI, his former prot√©g√©, and the king wished to neutralize or absorb the might of the Pe√±afiel family. Although Juana was not the heiress (yet), already in her youth she had to go along with royal wishes. The king's very influential concubine, Leonor de Guzm√°n, wanted to obtain some high prestige and property to her eldest son and had her eyes on the young Juana. On 27 July 1350 her brother and guardian, Fernando Manuel of Pe√±afiel, had to marry his young sister to Henry (1333‚Äì79), eldest of the illegitimate sons of Alfonso XI of Castile. This brought Henry certain lands. However it was later that Juana's relatives' heirless deaths made Juana the great heiress she turned out to be, while her husband became threat to the royal power.

Because Juana was a maternal granddaughter of La Palomilla, from her another cousin, Isabel de Lara who was murdered in 1361 and her young daughter Florentina (d after 1365), she also inherited Lara and Biscay.

It was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California and was produced by former Lovin' Spoonful members Zal Yanovsky and, coincidentally, his subsequent replacement Jerry Yester. It marked the beginning of Buckley's experimental period, as it incorporated elements of jazz that he had never used before. Many of the songs here represent a departure from the binary form that dominated much of his previous work. The sound of the album is characterized by David Friedman's vibraphone, an instrument which gives the album a more relaxed tone than Buckley's earlier work. The songs are much longer than on previous releases and this style continued through to later works. The vocals on the album are more drawn out than earlier performances and this represents the beginning of Buckley using his voice like an instrument. The lyrics on Happy Sad represent a change as Buckley stopped working with Larry Beckett, his lyricist on the two previous albums Tim Buckley and Goodbye and Hello, and began writing the lyrics himself. Buckley's self-penned efforts stand in contrast to Beckett's occasionally political and literary-style work.Underwood, Lee. Retrieved on May 1, 2008 Tim Buckley Biography timbuckley.com Buckley would also go on to author all his own material on the following two albums. Inspirations and song analysis Happy Sad shares much in common with his later albums, Lorca and Blue Afternoon. Much of the material that would appear on those albums was written at the same time as the songs that appear on this album, representing the most productive and prolific period of Buckley's career. Buckley's musical tastes expanded during the period that the album was written and the first track, \\"Strange Feelin\\", was directly inspired by Miles Davis' \\"All Blues\\" from Kind of Blue and the melody of the song is directly taken from the song. \\"Buzzin' Fly\\" was written much earlier than the rest of the work and was originally performed with a group Buckley had during high school, the Harlequin 3, with bassist Jim Fielder and later lyricist, Larry Beckett.Dream Brother: The Lives and Music of Jeff and Tim Buckley, David Browne The third track, \\"Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)\\", is a song composed of various movements and this represents the second time Buckley wrote in this manner, his previous effort being the title track of Goodbye and Hello. The segments of the song were written separately as \\"Danang\\" and \\"Asbury Park\\", as demonstrated on the later released demo sessions, The Dream Belongs to Me: Rare and Unreleased 1968 - 1973. The final version of the song is backed by an 'ocean' sound effect, however this was not originally intended to feature on the song. Buckley and the band were happy with the take of song but because of a recording problem the track had a slight electric buzzing in the background. The producer solved this by muffling the buzzing with the ocean overdub. \\"Dream Letter\\" is as an ode and apology to his ex-wife, Mary Guibert, and his son Jeff Buckley. This is the second song Buckley wrote about the pair, the first being \\"I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain\\" on his previous LP, Goodbye and Hello. In comparison to that song \\"Dream Letter\\" has a more apologetic tone, the lyrics reveal this with Buckley lamenting \\"Does he ever ask about me?\\" . It would be over five years later that Buckley would meet with his son again.Browne, David (October 24, 1993). Retrieved on May 1, 2008\\"The Unmade Star \\". The New York Times. The name of the song would later be used for a live album: posthumous release Dream Letter: Live in London 1968. The concert features much of the same personnel from the Happy Sad. \\"Gypsy Woman\\" is a long track highlighting Buckley's vocal acrobatics and on the record has some qualities of a jam session. Buckley and his band were disappointed with its recording but the song would remain as part of Buckley's live repertoire for the following years. The closer of the album, \\"Sing a Song For You\\", is more similar to Buckley's work on Goodbye and Hello than to the songs on the rest of the album. It shares the verse/chorus style and folk leanings of \\"Song to the Siren\\", which though released on Starsailor was written around the same period. Reception Released at the height of his popularity, Happy Sad was his highest charting album, reaching #81 in the US Pop albums chart, but Buckley's experimentation on this album would alienate some of the fanbase and his mainstream appeal he gained with Goodbye and Hello. However, this was only the beginning of Buckley's experimentation with sound and genre, and subsequent releases would further reduce his mainstream popularity and see his sales take a downturn.

It was the first bridge built across a river that connects Bandar Maharani, Muar to Tanjung Agas which is now named as part of Tangkak district. The bridge replaced old ferry services in the 1960s. The bridge was originally a toll bridge making the second toll bridge in Malaysia after Sultan Yahya Petra Bridge in Kelantan (opened in 1967). History Scene of the Sultan Ismail Bridge at evening Scene of Muar River bank from Sultan Ismail Bridge Before construction Before construction, the people who want to Cross (call for the Tanjung Agas and Malacca) had crossed the Muar river using the ferry facility called Penambang which began operating around 1890 since Muar was officially opened by the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar. Due to the rapid development time, felt unable to cope Penambang vehicles wishing to cross the Muar River. Travel by ferry is quite time consuming and even dangerous especially during flood season. Therefore, the proposal was made to build a bridge that will connect to Tanjung Agas Muar Town and Malacca. Originally, the government planned to build a bridge across Sungai Batu Pahat alone. But after receiving pressure from Muar residents, the government added a proposal to build a bridge to Muar and Batu Pahat. Proposal to build two bridges that have been included in the Second Malaya Plan (1961‚Äì1966) by the Malayan Public Works Department (JKR) and it was announced by the Minister of Public Works, Tun VT Sambanthan. The Government then open invitation to tender in 1960 and received 25 tenders from 10 firms who are interested in the two of them are from the French company based here. The government had to wait almost 4 years to get financing to build the bridge. Finally, in July 1964 the government announced that two local companies Wing Co. Ltd. and Development Services Ltd has won the tender of RM5.2 million for the two bridges Muar and Batu Pahat. Project costs Initially, the government estimated allocation of RM8 million for the construction of both the bridge and the government finally succeeded in obtaining financing proceeds of RM9 million loan from Chase Manhattan Bank. The government has allocated RM3.25 million for construction work. The work was initiated at the end of construction in 1965 and was completed in early 1967. They are built just 1.5 kilometres from the Tangga Batu Penambang Ferry Terminal. Constructions The bridge over 1,264 feet (385 meters) is constructed with an area of 24 feet (7 meters) of the vehicle lanes, 8-foot (2-meter) for bike paths / bike, and 5 feet of sidewalks. It can accommodate a load of 500 tons for each 100 feet (30 meters). To complete this bridge, 4 pontoons used to carry concrete mixers, cement, sand and cranes weighing up to 120 with 50 ton lift in which a total of 2 piers built specifically to fit the mould of concrete beams. The bridge was built on 48 piles of special steel imported from Germany and reinforced concrete piles 82. It is estimated that more than 9,000 cubic meters of concrete and 2100 tons of steel and a workforce of 130 people was used during the construction of the bridge. With the construction of this bridge, road users from Johor Bahru to Melaka when it has saved about 64 miles by road from Segamat‚ÄìTangkak‚ÄìJasin. To handle the influx of traffic due to the construction of the bridge. Four roundabouts was built at a cost of RM1 million in every locations including Jalan Yahya roundabout, Bentayan roundabout, Sulaiman roundabout and Khalidi roundabout. Opening The Muar bridge was officially opened by the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Sir Ismail Al-Khalidi ibni Almarhum Sultan Sir Ibrahim Al-Masyhur on Saturday, 16 April 1967 at 10.30 am and was named officially as the Sultan Ismail Bridge. The inauguration was witnessed by thousands of people who first opened and crossed the Muar River to use the bridge. Following the opening of the bridge, the Penambang ferry service was terminated effective midnight Friday, 15 April 1967. Tolls The Sultan Ismail Bridge is the second toll bridge in Malaysia after Sultan Yahya Petra Bridge in Kelantan (opened in 1967). The RM80,000 toll plaza was built in Tanjung Agas for toll collection to cover the cost of the building of the bridge. Initially, the government announced that tolls are charged RM0.25 for motorbikes, RM0.75 to RM1.75 for cars and heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses. After opening, the price raised to RM0.50 toll for motorbikes, RM1.50 for cars and taxis and RM3.50 for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses. This has invited objections from residents, particularly taxi and bus operators where at first they boycotted the use of the bridge. After numerous objections made mainly from traders and industrial sectors, starting 1 July 1971, the second Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak has announced a reduction to RM0.50 toll for cars and RM1.00 for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses, while for motorcyclists it is free. Tun Abdul Razak then visit to Muar in May 1975, he announced that the toll charged for Sultan Ismail Bridge Muar would be abolished.

He was one of the founding members of Jugantara Bengali weekly, a revolutionary outfit in Bengal. Barindra Ghosh was a younger brother of Sri Aurobindo. Early life Barindra Ghosh was born at Croydon, near London on 5 January 1880 although his ancestral village was Konnagar in Hooghly District of present-day West Bengal.Bandyopadhyay, Amritalal, Rishi Aurobindo, 1964, Biswas Publishing House, p. 6 His father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghosh, was a physician and district surgeon. His mother Swarnalata was the daughter of the Brahmo religious and social reformer, scholar Rajnarayan Basu. Revolutionary and a spiritualist in later life, Aurobindo Ghosh was Barindranath's third elder brother. His second elder brother, Manmohan Ghose, was a scholar of English literature, a poet and professor of English at Presidency College, Calcutta and at Dhaka University. He also had an elder sister named Sarojini Ghosh. Barindranath attended school in Deoghar, and after passing the entrance examination in 1901, joined Patna College. He received military training in Baroda. During this time, (late 19th century ‚Äì early 20th century) Barin was influenced by Aurobindo and drawn towards the revolutionary movement.  Revolutionary activities  Barin came back to Kolkata in 1902 and started organising several revolutionary groups in Bengal with the help of Jatindranath Banerjee. In 1906, he started publishing Jugantar, a Bengali weekly and a revolutionary organization named Jugantar soon followed. Jugantar was formed from the inner circle of Anushilan Samiti and it started preparation for armed militancy activities to oust British from Indian soil. Barin and Jatindranath Mukherjee alias Bagha Jatin were instrumental in the recruitment of many young revolutionaries from across Bengal. The revolutionaries formed the Maniktala group in Maniktala, Kolkata. It was a secret place where they started manufacturing bombs and collected arms and ammunition. Following the attempted killing of Kingsford by two revolutionaries Khudiram and Prafulla on 30 April 1908, the police intensified its investigation which led to the arrest of Barin and Aurobindo Ghosh on 2 May 1908, along with many of his comrades. The trial (known as the Alipore Bomb Case) initially sentenced Barin Ghosh and Ullaskar Datta to death. However, the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, by Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Barin was deported to the Cellular Jail in Andaman in 1909 along with other convicts.  Release and later activities  Barin was released during a general amnesty in 1920 and returned to Kolkata to start a career in journalism. Soon he left journalism and formed an ashram in Kolkata. He published his memoirs \\"The tale of my exile - twelve years in Andamans\\". In 1923, he left for Pondicherry where his elder brother Aurobindo Ghosh had formed the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He was influenced by Aurobindo towards spirituality and Sadhana. Barin returned to Kolkata in 1929 and again took up journalism. In 1933 he started an English weekly, The Dawn of India. He was associated with the newspaper The Statesman, and in 1950, he became the editor of the Bengali daily Dainik Basumati. This time he got married. He died on 18 April 1959.

This article deals exclusively with English family law. See residence in English law for disambiguation. In family law, the Court can order a Residence Order of the Family Court under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 following the breakdown of a marriage and determining where the children are to live and with whom. The order can be sole or joint, and if joint, it can be made to a couple regardless whether they are married. If a residence order is granted, this automatically gives him, her, or them parental responsibility for the child(ren) which will continue until the order terminates (usually this will be until the child(ren) reach their sixteenth birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying a longer period). Eligibility The following can make an application for a Residence Order under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 as of right: #the parent or guardian of the child(ren); #a married stepparent of the child(ren) where the child(ren) lived with the stepparent as child(ren) of the family; #anyone with whom the child has lived for at least three years (this period need not have been continuous but must have been recent). #anyone who: :a) where there is already a Residence Order in place has the consent of every one who holds that Order, or :b) who has the consent of the local authority where the child is in their care, or :c) has the consent of every one who has parental responsibility for the child. If an applicant cannot apply for the Order as of right, (e.g. they are wider family members such as grandparents etc. who wish to seek orders for their grandchildren), they can make an application to the court seeking leave to issue the application. In deciding whether to grant leave, the court will consider, amongst other things: #the nature of the application, #the applicant's connection with the child, and #the risk that the proposed application might disrupt the child(ren)'s life to such an extent that they should be harmed by it. The welfare principle As a matter of public policy, the courts have always operated under the doctrine of parens patriae to make the best interests of any children their first and paramount concern. From time to time, this doctrine has been included in statutes, the most recent relevant version being section 1 of The Children Act 1989 which requires the court to consider the \\"welfare checklist\\". Before making a section 8 order (i.e. a residence order) the court must consider: #The ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child concerned (considered in light of his or her age and understanding); #His or her physical, emotional and/or educational needs; #The likely effect on him or her of any change in the circumstances; #His or her age, sex, background and any other characteristics which the court considers relevant; #Any harm which he or she has suffered or is at risk of suffering; #How capable each of his parents and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his or her needs; #The range of powers available to the court under the Children Act 1989 in the proceedings in question. A child is not automatically a party to the proceedings and will be represented by a Guardian ad litem unless the court considers it necessary. If a Guardian is appointed but the children and the Guardian do not agree on what recommendations to make to the court and the children are of sufficient age and understanding, they will be able to instruct a solicitor directly to represent their views and the Guardian will present an independent view to the court. Whether or not a Guardian is appointed, the court can request a Welfare Report under section 7 of The Children Act 1989, either from the local authority where the child currently resides or from a Children and Family Reporter who is an officer appointed by CAFCASS. The report will usually inform the court of the child's wishes and feelings, but the officer will recommend what he or she thinks is in the child's best interests in the circumstances of the case rather than just advocate the child's wishes.

Early years Biasucci played college football for the Western Carolina Catamounts, and was a member of the team that reached the 1983 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game. He scored 280 points (conference record) on 57 of 93 field goal attempts and 109 of 113 extra point attempts. His longest field goal was 52 yards and 80 percent of his kickoffs landed in the end zone. He was three-time first-team All-Southern Conference selection. Professional career Biasucci was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Atlanta Falcons after the 1984 NFL Draft. He played in one preseason game, making a 37-yard field goal attempt against the Minnesota Vikings. He was released before the start of the season on August 14. On September 7, he was signed by the Indianapolis Colts to replace an injured Raul Allegre. Biasucci was the team's field goal kicker for four games and would remain the rest of the season as the kickoff specialist. In 1985, he lost the placekicking competition against Allegre. He was released before the start of the season on August 27. In 1986, he was signed to participate in training camp. He would pass Allegre othe depth chart and win the placekicker position. Professionally, Biasucci is the third all-time leading scorer for the Colts, collecting 783 points from 1984 to 1994. Personal life Biasucci became an actor after his retirement, portraying himself in Jerry Maguire and receiving roles in other smaller movies such as New Alcatraz. He also had small guest appearances on ER and The West Wing.http://www.colts.com/news/article-1/COLTSCOM-FLASHBACK--DEAN- BIASUCCI-/288ed7cd-0fbc-47af-848c-f3189bfb3597 Biasucci was also a charter guest during an episode of the Bravo network reality show Below Deck Mediterranean.

Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords (e.g. \\"WOSK\\") and pseudohomophones (e.g. \\"WERK\\"). The effect was first described by Cattell (1886), and important contributions came from Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Cattell first wrote, \\"I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no connexion as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters\\". G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word \\"card\\", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as \\"cqrd\\". Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word. The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during reading. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using connectionist networks. Experimental task The WSE has traditionally been tested using a tachistoscope, as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope. A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if \\"WOSK\\" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether \\"K\\" or \\"H\\" had been in \\"WOSK\\". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. \\"WKRG\\") or single letters. Hypotheses The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have semantic value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind). Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word, or the duration of the masks. Models The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the interactive activation model (IAM) and the dual-route coding model (DRC) Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer's conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing. The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from lexical decision and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision. Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top- down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase \\"A cow says...\\" a person would guess \\"moo\\" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters). The WSE and an interactive-activation model Rumelhart & McClelland's interactive-activation model. The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for \\"C\\", horizontal and vertical bars for \\"H\\", etc.). Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Some words can be activated through these stimulations. However, the fact that there is no meaning to the combination of letters can inhibit these words which were previously activated. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word \\"WORK\\" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader). According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus. However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE. Activation- verification model The AVM deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification. Adverse word superiority effect One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland reportwas that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular position, they would experience the adverse word superiority effect. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word.
