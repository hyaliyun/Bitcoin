Best known in North America as the Earl of Hillsborough, he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1768 to 1772, a critical period leading toward the American War of Independence. Background Born at Fairford, Gloucestershire, Wills Hill was the son of Trevor Hill, 1st Viscount Hillsborough and Mary, daughter of Anthony Rowe. He was named after General Sir Charles Wills, his godfather. Political career Hill, known retrospectively as Downshire, was returned to Parliament for Warwick in 1741, a seat he held until 1756. He succeeded his father as second Viscount Hillsborough in 1742 (as this was an Irish peerage he was able to continue to sit in the British House of Commons). He was the same year appointed Lord Lieutenant of County Down and Custos Rotulorum of County Down. In 1751 he was created Earl of Hillsborough in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1754 he was made Comptroller of the Household, a post he held until 1756, and appointed a Privy Counsellor. In 1756 he was created Baron Harwich, of Harwich in the County of Essex, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. For nearly two years, between 1763 and 1765, he was President of the Board of Trade and Plantations under George Grenville, and after a brief period of retirement he filled the same position in 1766, and then that of joint Postmaster-General, under the Earl of Chatham. From 1768 to 1772 Hillsborough was Secretary of State for the Colonies and also President of the Board of Trade. Both in and out of office, Hillsborough opposed all concessions to the American colonists, but he favoured the project for a union between England and the Kingdom of Ireland. On his retirement in 1772 he was created Earl of Hillsborough in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1779 he served as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, remaining until 1782. He was the last person to serve in this position, because the Secretaries of State were reorganized. In 1789, he was made Marquess of Downshire in the Irish peerage. Family and legacy Lord Downshire married firstly Lady Margaretta, daughter of Robert FitzGerald, 19th Earl of Kildare, in 1747. His second daughter and last child by his first marriage was Lady Charlotte Hill, wife of John Chetwynd-Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot. Lady Talbot was the subject of a notable portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. After her death in 1766 he married secondly Mary Bilson-Legge, 1st Baroness Stawell, daughter of Edward Stawell, 4th Baron Stawell and widow of Henry Bilson-Legge, in 1768. She died in 1780. Lord Downshire died on 7 October 1793, aged 75, and was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, Arthur. In the United States, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, the town of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, within the county, the town of Hillsborough, North Carolina, and Hillsborough County, Florida, were named after the Marquess. In Canada, Hillsborough Bay, on Prince Edward Island, and the village of Hillsborough, New Brunswick, were named in Downshire's honour. Wax profile portrait of Lord Hillsborough by 'Lewis'.

History Montego Bay, 1820 When Christopher Columbus visited the island in 1494, he named the bay Golfo de Buen Tiempo (\\"Fair Weather Gulf\\"). The name \\"Montego Bay\\" is believed to have originated as a corruption of the Spanish word manteca (\\"lard\\"), allegedly because during the Spanish period it was the port where lard, leather and beef were exported. Jamaica was a colony of Spain from 1511 until 1655, when Oliver Cromwell's Caribbean expedition, the Western Design, drove the Spanish from the island. country's colonial period. It is also home to the National Gallery West. During the epoch of slavery, from the mid-17th century until 1834, and well into the 20th century, the town functioned primarily as a sugarcane port. The island's last major slave revolt, the Christmas Rebellion or Baptist War (1831‚Äì1832) took place in the area around Montego Bay; the leader of the revolt, Samuel Sharpe, was hanged there in 1832. Sharpe was proclaimed a national hero of Jamaica in 1975, and the main square of the town was renamed in his honor. Montego Bay's city status prior to British rule was debated; however, it had its city status revoked during Jamaica's British colonial period. It was re-proclaimed a city by act of parliament in 1980, but this has not meant that it has acquired any form of autonomy, for it continues to be an integral part of the parish of St. James. Cruise ship at Montego Bay Today, Montego Bay is known for Cornwall Regional Hospital, port facilities, second homes for numerous upper-class Jamaicans from Kingston as well as North Americans and Europeans, fine restaurants, and shopping. The coastland near Montego Bay is occupied by numerous tourist resorts, most newly built, some occupying the grounds of old sugarcane plantations with some of the original buildings and mill-works still standing. The most famous is the White Witch's Rose Hall which features a world-class golf course. The infrastructure of the city is going through a series of modernizations which once completed, aims to keep Montego Bay as a top destination in the region. The Montego Bay Convention Centre, built on a large site near to the Rose Hall estate, was opened by Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding on 7 January 2011. Jamaican Tourist Board news report. Demographics The majority of the city's population is of African descent. The city is also home to sizeable minority ethnic groups such as the East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the mid-to-late 19th century. The Chinese especially occupy important roles in the city's economy especially in retail where Downtown Montego Bay is home to many shops and supermarkets owned by Chinese immigrants. The city's East Indian population also play a key role as they operate many gift and jewelry shops in the city which are mostly geared to tourists. There is a minority of Europeans, some descending from immigrants from Germany (the city is a 90-minute drive from German settlements such as German Town in Westmoreland) and Great Britain (who own most of the land in the city from as far back as the days of the slave trade). The city is home to many immigrants from Hispanic countries such as Mexico, Cuba and Spain as well as many French, Russians and Italians (who mostly own homes or beachfront properties in the area). The city is home to many Americans and Canadians, who work the tourism or business process outsourcing (BPO) industries. Religion There are a wide variety of Christian churches in the city. Most are Protestant, a legacy of British colonisation of the island. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal. Afro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following. The city also has a unit of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The city also has communities of Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. Economy Doctor's Cave Beach Montego Bay is pivotal to Jamaica's economy. The city holds most of the weight of the country's tourism sector. Most of the country's visitors arrive and depart from Montego Bay's airport or port. Many international companies have resorts in the city including Hyatt, Hilton Hotels, Holiday Inn, RIU Hotels, Royalton and Iberostar. The city is the home to the headquarters of international resort chain Sandals. The Government of Jamaica, through the Ministry of Tourism, has begun to focus on bolstering the city's entertainment and gastronomic offerings. Though the city's airport hosts a number international chains, the city itself does not have access to these restaurants. By virtue of this new focus, the city has become home to a newly established Hard Rock Caf√© and became home to Starbucks' first Jamaican location, at Doctor's Cave Beach, in November 2017.Hard Rock Cafe Coming to MoBayStarbucks to Open in Jamaica, Further Expanding its Presence in the Caribbean Starbucks First Store in Jamaica Honors Country‚Äôs Rich Heritage The city also serves as the Head Office for Starbucks' operations in Jamaica.

The airport was the hub of Jamaica's former national airline Air Jamaica. The airline also had its Reservations, Western Jamaica Sales & Ticketing office, as well as its Vacations division in the city until its purchase by Caribbean Airlines in 2011, when they moved their offices to Kingston. The site is now the headquarters for Island Routes, a company owned by the Sandals-ATL Group, which in the past was affiliated with the airline. The airport is served by several North American and European airlines, connecting the island with the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and South America.

Other locations like Philadelphia, New York City, Toronto, Washington D.C. and Montreal can be reached in under four hours. The airport is also one of two airports in the Caribbean (other being Havana), that has a non-stop flight to Los Angeles, allowing passengers the ability to connect to flights to Asia, Australia and Oceania. The airport has undergone major expansion since 2003, and has won awards including the coveted World Travel Award for being the Caribbean's Leading Airport, beating airports like Punta Cana International Airport and Grantley Adams International Airport. =Port= There is a free port and cruise line terminal on a man-made peninsula jutting into the bay. Communications =Fixed voice and broadband= Fixed voice and broadband services in Montego Bay is provided by FLOW. FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and cable broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. This copper network is currently being upgraded to VDSL2, which may allow speeds of over 50 Mbit/s over existing copper lines as well as provide a migration path for the provider to Fibre to the Home. FLOW also has a fibre-optic network in the neighbourhood of Rhyne Park which provides up to 100 Mbit/s as well. There are several other small cable companies such as Cornwall Communications, that provides cable broadband and voice over its cable network; however, they are vastly incomparable in subscriber numbers to FLOW. =Mobile voice and broadband= Mobile voice and broadband services in Montego Bay is dominated by both incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, 3G HSPA & HSPA+ connectivity in and around the city. Currently, FLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz with speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s. FLOW also offers LTE data in Montego Bay. The company is the currently the only carrier to provide comprehensive LTE coverage within the city itself. Coverage also extends out towards to the adjoining rural areas surrounding Montego Bay such as Liliput to east and Hopewell (in the parish of Hanover) to the west. FLOW's LTE network uses LTE Band 4, commonly known as AWS. Users can avail themselves of speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up. In some areas in the city, FLOW subscribers are able to access LTE Advanced with speeds up to 225 Mbit/s; making Montego Bay the only city in Jamaica to have access to such. Digicel, Jamaica's larger mobile network, also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+; however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on paired 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel's LTE network is also available in Montego Bay, owing to its commitment to provide an islandwide LTE network, offering LTE in the city for its subscribers. The network is theoretically capable of speeds up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum. In popular culture The city was the subject of a namesake song by Bobby Bloom in 1970, which became a Top Ten hit in the United States for Bloom. It was covered by Jon Stevens in 1980 and by Amazulu in 1986, becoming minor hits for both.

He was Secretary of State for the Northern Department 1674‚Äì79. Early life Williamson was born at Bridekirk, near Cockermouth in Cumberland, where his father, also called Joseph, was vicar. His father died when he was very young, and his mother remarried the Reverend John Ardery.Secombe p.2 His relatively humble origins were often referred to unkindly in later life by his enemies, especially after he married into the aristocracy. He was educated at St. Bees School, Westminster School and Queen's College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow.Secombe p.2 Early career In 1660 he entered the service of the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Sir Edward Nicholas, retaining his position under the succeeding secretary, Sir Henry Bennet, afterwards Earl of Arlington. He made himself indispensable to Arlington, due to his enormous capacity for hard work, which resulted in his employer delegating most the routine work of the department to him. He was involved with the foundation of the London Gazette in 1665. Williamson was elected Member of Parliament for Thetford in 1669 and held the seat until 1685. No less than three previous attempts to enter Parliament had been unsuccessful, due to an increasing \\"backlash\\" against Government candidates. Samuel Pepys in his celebrated Diary records that when Williamson appeared at the hustings in 1666, he was shouted down by cries of \\"No courtiers!\\"Diary of Samuel Pepys 21 October 1666 In 1672 he was made one of the clerks of the council and was knighted. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he drew up plans for the Zealand Expedition which was intended to land a newly formed English Army in the Netherlands. The strategy was abandoned after the naval defeat at the Battle of Texel and the Treaty of Westminster which ended the war. In 1673 and 1674 he represented his country at the Congress of Cologne, and in the latter year he became Secretary of State for the Northern Department, having practically purchased this position from Arlington for ¬£6,000, a sum that he required from his successor when he left office in 1679. He served as Master of The Clothworkers' Company in 1676‚Äì77. In 1677, he became the second President of the Royal Society, but his main interests, after politics, were in antiquarian rather than in scientific matters. As Secretary of State he largely continued Arlington's policy of friendship towards France, and hostility towards the Netherlands.Sir Joseph represented England at the Congress of Nijmegen (1678-79). William III of Orange developed a deep aversion to Williamson: quite apart from their opposing policies, he is said to have found the tone of Williamson's dispatches unbearably patronising (\\"as though I was a child to be fed on whipped cream\\" William grumbled). Popish Plot Just before his removal from the post of Secretary of State, he was arrested on a charge of being implicated in the Popish Plot,Kenyon pp.117‚Äì8 but he was at once released by order of Charles II. Williamson was a particular target of the informers because he was one of the few Ministers who openly disbelieved in the Plot:Kenyon p.77 when Israel Tonge first approached him with \\"information\\", Williamson, who believed, with some reason, that Tonge was insane, gave him a \\"rude repulse\\".Kenyon p.70 As for the other informers, several of whom were members of London's criminal underworld, his efficient intelligence service no doubt told him everything necessary about their characters. For this reason, the King, who was equally sceptical about the Plot's reality, wished to retain his services, at least in the short term. The actual charge made against Williamson, of commissioning Roman Catholic army officers, was entirely spurious since these officers were intended for foreign service. Williamson's nerve began to give way under the strain of the Plot, and he became a political liability. Charles finally dismissed him after he gave orders to search Somerset House, the Queen's official residence, without the King's permission; the King, \\"in great anger\\" told him that \\"I marvel at your effrontery in searching my house... your head is turning.....I do not wish to be served by a man who fears anyone more than me\\".Kenyon p.155 Danby was suspected by many of having a part in Williamson's downfall, as he was said to have taken offence at Williamson's recent marriage to Lady Clifton, a wealthy widow and cousin of the King.Secombe p.6 Marriage His marriage, at the beginning of the Popish Plot, should on the face of it have strengthened him politically: his wife was Katherine Stewart, Baroness Clifton, daughter of George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny, and sister of Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, and thus a member of a junior branch of the Stuart dynasty.Secombe p.6 Her first husband, by whom she had several children, was Henry O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan(c. 1642 ‚Äì 1 September 1678), an old friend of Williamson; she and Williamson had no children. Despite the obvious advantages of the match to Williamson himself, John Evelyn reported that it was very unpopular, and it probably weakened Williamson politically. Since Katherine as well as her first husband was an old friend of Williamson she was not a surprising choice as a bride; but the fact that O'Brien had been dead for only three months when she remarried gave rise to ill-natured gossip that Williamson and Katherine had been lovers during her first marriage: \\"'Tis said they live together less happily than before they married\\" ran one gibe. More seriously in an age of marked class distinctions, it was considered improper that the sister of a Royal Duke should marry a country clergyman's son, and even her children are said to have objected to the marriage.Secombe p.6 Danby, who reportedly thought that Katherine would be a good match for his own son, was suspected of having had a hand in Williamson's downfall. Later career After a period of comparative inactivity, in 1698 he signed the Treaty of The Hague (1698), the first treaty for the partition of the Spanish Monarchy. It was characteristic of William III that despite his personal dislike of Williamson, so evident in the 1670s, he did not hesitate to make use of his diplomatic skills. The negotiations had been kept a strict secret, and news of the Treaty caused uproar in England, but Williamson himself escaped any serious censure. In 1690, Williamson was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester and held the seat until 1701. He was also elected MP for Thetford in three separate elections, but each time chose to sit for Rochester instead. Between 1692 and 1695, Williamson was also MP in the Irish House of Commons for Clare. In 1695 he represented Portarlington for few months and subsequently Limerick City until 1699. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1696, as a tribute to his interest in civic improvements in Dublin. In return he presented the city fathers with a silver cup. Death and reputation Williamson died at Cobham, Kent, on 3 October 1701, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his widow joined him a year later. He had become very rich by taking advantage of the many opportunities of making money which his official position gave him; and despite the heavy debts left by her brother, his wife is also said to have brought him a fortune. He left ¬£6,000 and his library to Queen's College, Oxford; ¬£5,000 to found a school at Rochester, Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School; and ¬£2,000 to Thetford. A great number of Williamson's letters, dispatches, memoranda, etc., are among the English state papers. He has been described as one of the greatest English civil servants of his time, and is credited with building up an intelligence service as efficient as that which John Thurloe had operated under Oliver Cromwell. His detailed notes of Privy Council meetings are an invaluable source of information about its operation, especially in the political crisis of 1678‚Äì79. On the other hand he was a poor public speaker: even Charles II, himself a very hesitant speaker, complained of his \\"droning\\". Despite his gifts he was not popular, being described as dry, formal and arrogant, an uncertain friend and a harsh employer. Many of his colleagues, like Sir Leoline Jenkins, felt the lash of his sharp tongue. On the other hand, his will, in which he remembered all those who had a claim on him, suggests that he did not lack a certain generosity of character; and he was capable of forming lifelong friendships, notably with Samuel Pepys. In fiction He is a recurring character in the Thomas Chaloner series of mystery novels by Susanna Gregory, in which he plays a somewhat villainous role: his wife and her first husband appear in the seventh book in the series, The Piccadilly Plot.

The two were primary members in Squeeze and Difford & Tilbrook. According to Difford, he stole 50p from his mother's purse to put a card in a local sweetshop window advertising for a guitarist to join his band, although he did not have one at the time. Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advert and they met for the first time shortly afterwards. Some of their best-known songs are \\"Tempted\\", \\"Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)\\", \\"Black Coffee in Bed\\", \\"Cool for Cats\\", \\"Up the Junction\\" and \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\". Chris Difford performing at London's Royal Albert Hall, October 2009, in aid of the PRS (Performing Right Society) for Music Members' Benevolent Fund. After the break-up of Squeeze in 1983 Difford continued writing songs for artists such as Jools Holland, Helen Shapiro, Billy Bremner and Elvis Costello. He has also written lyrics for music by Jools Holland, Elton John, Wet Wet Wet, Marti Pellow and others. He was involved with Tilbrook and John Turner in the creation of a musical, Labelled with Love, which was created using the songs of Squeeze. The 1983 musical performed in Deptford was short-lived. In 1984 the pair released the album Difford and Tilbrook and had a minor hit in the UK with Love's Crashing Waves which reached 57 in the UK charts. In 1985 Squeeze reunited, having hits in the US with Babylon and On, \\"Hourglass\\" and \\"853-5937\\". Difford left the group in 1999 launching a solo career in 2003 with his album I Didn't Get Where I Am. Difford was also manager of Bryan Ferry and The Strypes. Squeeze reunited again in 2007, and Difford maintains a concurrent solo career alongside his work with the band. In March 2010, Difford curated Songs in the Key of London, an evening of music dedicated to the capital at the Barbican Centre, London. In 2017, Chris published his autobiography Some Fantastic Place: My Life In and Out of Squeeze. Personal life Difford was raised in Greenwich. He lived in New York with his first wife and their two children. He then lived in Rye, Sussex, with the mother of his two youngest children. Currently, he lives just outside Brighton, Sussex with his wife, Louise, whom he married in April 2013.

The Church of God (Huntsville, Alabama) shares a common history with the Church of God of Prophecy (COGOP) up until their division in 1943. The original Church of God was led by Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson (1865-1943) until his death. The leaders of the church determined to install Milton A. Tomlinson as the General Overseer of the church. Milton's brother, Homer Aubrey Tomlinson, withdrew and established church headquarters in Queens Village, Queens. After the death of Homer Tomlinson, Voy M.

Biography =Early career= Anami was born in Taketa city in ≈åita Prefecture, where his father was a senior bureaucrat in the Home Ministry and grew up in Tokyo and in Tokushima Prefecture. He attended the 18th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Infantry in December 1906. In November 1918, Anami graduated from the 30th class of the Army Staff College with the rank of captain. He was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from April 1919 and was promoted to major in February 1922. From August 1923 to May 1925 he was assigned to the staff of the Sakhalin Expeditionary Army which was responsible for the occupation of northern Sakhalin island during the Japanese intervention in Siberia. Anami was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1925. From August to December 1925, Anami was sent as a military attach√© to France. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the 45th Infantry Regiment, and became unit commander in August 1928. From August 1929 to August 1930, Anami served as Aide-de-camp to Emperor Hirohito. He was then promoted to colonel. From August 1933 to August 1934, Anami served as regimental commander of the 2nd Guard Regiment of the Imperial Guards. He was subsequently Commandant of the Tokyo Military Preparatory School, and promoted to major general in March 1935. =War-time career= From August 1936, Anami served as Chief of the Military Administration Bureau of the War Ministry. He became Chief of the Personnel Bureau in March 1937 and was promoted to lieutenant general in March the following year. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Anami was given a combat command, as Commander of the IJA 109th Division in China from November 1938. He was recalled to Japan in October 1939 to assume the role of Vice-Minister of War in the cabinet of Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Anami belonged to the clique which supported the rise of Hideki Tojo to power in October 1941. However, in April 1941, Anami returned to China as Commander in Chief of the IJA 11th Army, covering ongoing operations in central China. He was transferred to the Japanese Second Area Army in Manchukuo in July 1942.Ammentorp, The Generals of World War II In May 1943, Anami was promoted to full general. As the war conditions in the Pacific deteriorated for the Japanese, the Second Area Army was reassigned to the Southern Theater from November 1943, where Anami directed operations in western New Guinea and Halmahera. Anami was recalled to Japan December 1944, becoming Inspector General of Army Aviation and Chief of the Army Aeronautical Department, while concurrently serving on the Supreme War Council. In April 1945, he was appointed War Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Kantar≈ç Suzuki. =Political career= As War Minister, Anami was outspoken against the idea of surrender, despite his awareness that Japan's losses on the battlefield and the destruction of Japan's cities and industrial capability by American bombing meant that by this point Japan had lost the war militarily.Axelrood, Encyclopedia of World War II, p. 55. Even after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Anami opposed acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, and proposed instead that a large-scale battle be fought on the Japanese mainland causing such massive Allied casualties that Japan would somehow be able to evade surrender and perhaps even keep some of what it had conquered.Brooks, Behind Japan's Surrender Eventually, his arguments against what he perceived to be the dishonor of surrender were overcome when Emperor Hirohito ordered an end to the war; Anami's supporters suggested that he either vote against surrender or resign from the Cabinet. Instead, he ordered his officers to concede, later saying to his brother-in-law, \\"As a Japanese soldier, I must obey my Emperor.\\" He informed the officers of the War Ministry of the decision, and that as it was an Imperial command, they must obey.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936‚Äì1945 p 814‚Äì815 Random House New York 1970 His refusal to support any action against the Imperial decision was a key point in the failure of the Ky≈´j≈ç incident, an attempted military coup d'√©tat by junior officers to prevent the surrender announcement from being broadcast. On 14 August 1945, Anami signed the surrender document with the rest of the cabinet, then committed seppuku early the next morning.Frank, Downfall pp 319‚Äì320 His suicide note read: \\"I‚Äîwith my death‚Äîhumbly apologize to the Emperor for the great crime.\\"Pacific War Research Society, Japan's Longest Day, p 88‚Äì89 This cryptic note is open to multiple interpretations.Frank, Downfall pp 319‚Äì320 Anami's grave is at Tama Cemetery, in Fuch≈´, Tokyo.

It was formed on June 10, 1764 from the eastern part of Granville County by the Province of North Carolina General Assembly. It was named for John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1762 to 1763. In 1779 Bute County was divided into Franklin County and Warren County, and ceased to exist. Description A portion of John Collet's 1770 map of North Carolina depicting the environs of Bute County The county was formed in order to bring the residents of the eastern half of Granville County with improved access to local government, particularly those residing in St. John's Parish. Bute County was expanded in 1766 to include the northwest part of Northampton County. The residents of Bute County were very much opposed to British rule. When governor William Tryon called for troops to counter the Regulator Movement in 1768, his orders were ignored by the Bute County militia. In the 1770s, it was claimed that \\"There were no Tories in Bute\\". After the Provincial Congress of 1775 and 1776, an act was proposed to divide Bute County. After more than two years of discussion, Bute County was divided on January 20, 1779, generally along the Shocco Creek, with Warren County in the north and Franklin County to the south. The Bute County courthouse was located along Buffalo Rice Path, on land owned by Jethro Sumner. This location is about six miles southeast of Warrenton, North Carolina. There was one other town in Bute County, a town without a post office called Littleton. Most of the records of Bute county are located in Warren County.

He created, produced, and hosted the political commentary series The McLaughlin Group. He also hosted and produced John McLaughlin's One on One which ran from 1984 to 2013. Education and early career John Joseph McLaughlin was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Eva Philomena (n√©e Turcotte) and Augustus Hugh McLaughlin.\\"Biography: John McLaughlin\\", Turner Classic Movies He grew up in a Catholic family who were second-generation Irish Americans and attended La Salle Academy, Providence. At age 18, he entered Weston College in Weston, Massachusetts, which later became the theological seminary of Boston College, to prepare for the priesthood.Murray, Michael D. (editor). \\"Biography: John McLaughlin\\", Encyclopedia of Television News He entered the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church in 1947, was ordained as a priest in 1959, and went on to earn two master's degrees (philosophy and English literature) from Boston College. After his ordination, McLaughlin spent some years as a high school teacher at Fairfield College Preparatory School, a Jesuit prep school in Connecticut. He took time off from teaching to earn a Ph.D. (philosophy) from Columbia University. He wrote his thesis on the Roman Catholic poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. He then became a writer and later assistant editor for the Jesuit current affairs publication, America, in New York City. Disagreements with the editor of the magazine led to his departure in 1970 after which he moved back to Providence. McLaughlin was originally a supporter of the Democratic Party and opposed the Vietnam War, but then became a war supporter and changed his party affiliation to Republican. In 1970 he sought permission from the Jesuit order to run for a seat in the United States Senate, representing Rhode Island. They had given permission to fellow Jesuit Father Robert Drinan who ran successfully for the United States House of Representatives in Massachusetts. When they refused, McLaughlin ran anyway but lost to the incumbent four-term Senator John O. Pastore. Through a friendship with Pat Buchanan, McLaughlin then became a speechwriter for U.S. President Richard Nixon. In 1974, after the resignation of President Nixon, he spent two months under President Gerald Ford's administration. In 1975, he left the priesthood. Media career After leaving the White House, McLaughlin worked with his wife Ann in public relations and in 1980 became a weekend radio host on WRC-AM in Washington, D.C. Eventually he was fired from that job. He then went on to write for National Review and to host The McLaughlin Group, which premiered in 1982. The television show features four political commentators, usually two conservatives and two liberals, with McLaughlin seated in the middle. His loud and forceful style of presentation was parodied by comedians and other commentators, most notably Dana Carvey of Saturday Night Live. McLaughlin enjoyed SNL's recurring McLaughlin Group sketches, even making a 1991 cameo appearance as the Grim Reaper in one of them. He was known for two catchphrases: \\"Wrong!\\" used to cut off a panelist with whom he disagreed, and \\"Bye-bye!\\" used at the end of each episode of McLaughlin Group. McLaughlin also hosted the interview show John McLaughlin's One on One, first telecast in 1984, and ended in 2013. Also from 1989 through 1994, he produced and hosted McLaughlin, a one-hour nightly talk show on CNBC. For a short while in 1999, he hosted an MSNBC show, McLaughlin Special Report. The show was announced on January 22, and its cancellation was announced on February 25. A revival of The McLaughlin Group debuted in 2018, and retains McLaughlin's name in the show's title despite his death. Personal life and death On August 23, 1975, McLaughlin married Ann Dore (n√©e Lauenstein), his former campaign manager. She served as Secretary of Labor under President Ronald Reagan from 1987 until 1989. During this period, McLaughlin was sued for sexual harassment and discrimination by a former employee. He settled the suit for $4 million in December 1989. McLaughlin and Dore divorced in 1992. McLaughlin married his second wife Cristina Clara Vidal on June 22, 1997. The marriage ended in divorce in 2010. During the December 26, 2014, year-end awards episode, McLaughlin ended the show saying: \\"Person of the year: Pope Francis, especially now that he's told that animals can go to heaven. And Oliver is up there waiting for me.\\"http://www.mclaughlin.com/transcript.htm?id=1042 Oliver Productions, Inc., is named after McLaughlin's pet dog http://www.mclaughlin.com/transcript.htm?id=689 ‚Äî a Basset Hound ‚Äî and is seen in an animation as part of the brand logo shown at the close of each show.

McLaughlin's last message to fans was August 13, when he explained he had missed recent tapings due to his poor health. In popular culture The McLaughlin Group was parodied a number of times on Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s, where McLaughlin was played by Dana Carvey. McLaughlin also appeared in several films, including Dave, Mission: Impossible, Independence Day, and War, Inc., generally portraying himself discussing a political character in the movie. In the 2009 movie Watchmen, he is portrayed by Gary Houston in an early scene interviewing Pat Buchanan (played by James M. Connor) and Eleanor Clift (played by Mary Ann Burger) about the possibility of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. McLaughlin also hosted a special celebration for the 200th episode of the NBC sitcom Cheers.

Generally, there is a burden of production of exculpatory evidence in the legal defense of justification. In most countries, a homicide is justified when there is sufficient evidence to disprove (under the \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" standard for criminal charges, and \\"preponderance of evidence\\" standard for claims of wrongdoing, i.e. civil liability) the alleged criminal act or wrongdoing. The key to this legal defense is that it was reasonable for the subject to believe that there was an imminent and otherwise unavoidable danger of death or grave bodily harm to the innocent by the deceased when he or she committed the homicide. A homicide in this instance is blameless.Black's Law Dictionary : justifiable homicide is the blameless killing of a person, such as in self-defense. Although it does not constitute homicide, charges and claims of assaults, batteries, and other similar criminal charges and claims of wrongdoing are similarly defensible under the legal defense of self defense. Common excusing conditions Potentially excusing conditions common to multiple jurisdictions include the following. #Capital punishment (illegal in most countries). #Where a state is engaged in a war with a legitimate casus belli, a combatant may lawfully kill an enemy combatant so long as that combatant is not hors de combat. This principle is embedded in public international law and has been respected by most states around the world. Thus, if there is no formal declaration of war or the casus belli is not legitimate, all those who engage in the fighting and kill enemy combatants could theoretically be prosecuted. Protecting the national interest against external aggressors is considered an excuse on utilitarian grounds, i.e. the greatest public good will be derived from the defeat of the enemy. #In most countries, it is lawful for a citizen to repel violence with violence to protect his or her own or another's life and limb, to prevent arson of an occupied building, or to prevent violent sexual assault or to quell a riot (see below). #*The scope of self-defense varies; some jurisdictions have a duty to retreat rule that disallows this defense if it was safe to flee from potential violence. In some jurisdictions, the castle doctrine allows the use of deadly force in self-defense against an intruder in one's home. Other jurisdictions have stand-your-ground laws that allow use of deadly force in self-defense in a vehicle or in public, without a duty to retreat. #Where the person's death is inflicted by the effecting of lawful arrest or prevention of lawfully detained person's escape, quelling riot or insurrection when the use of force is \\"no more than absolutely necessary\\". #The doctrine of necessity allows, for example, a surgeon to separate conjoined twins, killing the weaker twin to allow the stronger twin to survive. (This is not recognized, for example, in England and Wales). #In the United States, the 2005 Unborn Victims of Violence Act changed the legal definition of human fetuses to \\"unborn children\\", formally defining feticide as murder (under USC ¬ß1111). However, the law retains explicit exceptions which prohibit the prosecution \\"of any person for conduct relating to an abortion,\\" \\"of any person for any medical treatment,\\" or \\"of any woman with respect to her unborn child,\\" thereby preserving the right to an abortion stemming from Roe v. Wade. #Several countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of Quebec allow both active and passive euthanasia by law, if justified. #The \\"heat of the moment\\" defense for crimes of passion: death results from a situation where the defendant is deemed to have lost control. This is often considered a part of the defense of provocation against charges of murder. Based on the idea that all individuals may suddenly and unexpectedly lose control when words are spoken or events occur, jurisdictions differ on whether this should be allowed to excuse liability or merely mitigate to a lesser offense such as manslaughter, and under which circumstances this defense can be used. #A few jurisdictions do not prosecute (Iran, Iraq) or have a lesser penalty (Kuwait, Egypt) for honor killings.Preliminary Examination of so-called \\"Honour Killings\\" in Canada  European Convention on Human Rights  Article 2 Paragraph 2 of the European Convention On Human Rights provides that that death resulted from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is \\"no more than absolutely necessary\\": ::: 2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary: ::: (a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence; ::: (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; ::: (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.  Example of Criminal Procedure Act in South Africa  In South Africa, ¬ß49 Criminal Procedure Act used to provide: :::(2) Where the person concerned is to be arrested for an offense referred to in Schedule 1 or is to be arrested on the ground of having committed such an offense, and the person authorized under this Act to arrest or to assist in arresting him cannot arrest him or prevent him from fleeing by other means than killing him, the killing shall be deemed to be justifiable homicide. ::This has now been amended by ¬ß7 Judicial Matters Second Amendment Act 122 of 1998: :::(2) If any arrestor attempts to arrest a suspect and the suspect resists the attempt, or flees, or resists the attempt and flees, when it is clear that an attempt to arrest him or her is being made, and the suspect cannot be arrested without the use of force, the arrestor may, in order to effect the arrest, use such force as may be reasonably necessary and proportional in the circumstances to overcome resistance or to prevent the suspect from fleeing: Provided that the arrestor is justified in terms of this section in using deadly force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to a suspect, only if he or she believes on reasonable grounds- :::(a) that the force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting the arrestor, any person lawfully assisting the arrestor or any other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm; :::(b) that there is a substantial risk that the suspect will cause imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm if the arrest is delayed; or :::(c) that the offence for which the arrest is sought is in progress and is of a forcible and serious nature and involves the use of life threatening violence or a strong likelihood that it will cause grievous bodily harm.  Examples of justifiable homicide in the United States of America  A non-criminal homicide ruling, usually committed in self-defense or in defense of another, exists under United States law. A homicide may be considered justified if it is done to prevent a very serious crime, such as rape, armed robbery, manslaughter or murder. The victim must reasonably believe, under the totality of the circumstances, that the assailant intended to commit a criminal act that would likely result in the death or life-threatening injury of an innocent person. A homicide performed out of vengeance, or retribution for action in the past, or in pursuit of a \\"fleeing felon\\" (except under specific circumstances) would not be considered justifiable. In many states, given a case of self-defense, the defendant is expected to obey a duty to retreat if it is possible to do so. In the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,Montana Code Annotated 45-3-103 Retrieved 12-Mar-2009 New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wyoming and other Castle Doctrine states, there is no duty to retreat in certain situations (depending on the state, this may apply to one's home, business, or vehicle, or to any public place where a person is lawfully present). Preemptive self- defense, in which one kills another on suspicion that the victim might eventually become dangerous, is not justifiable. In the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of District of Columbia v. Heller, the majority held that the Constitution protected the right to the possession of firearms for the purpose of self-defense \\"and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home\\". U.S. Supreme Court ruling of District of Columbia v. Heller Two other forms of justifiable homicide are unique to the prison system: the death penalty and preventing prisoners from escaping. To quote the California State Penal Code (state law) that covers justifiable homicide: :196. Homicide is justifiable when committed by public officers and those acting by their command in their aid and assistance, either-- :1. In obedience to any judgment of a competent Court; or, :2. When necessarily committed in overcoming actual resistance to the execution of some legal process, or in the discharge of any other legal duty; or, :3. When necessarily committed in retaking felons who have been rescued or have escaped, or when necessarily committed in arresting persons charged with felony, and who are fleeing from justice or resisting such arrest. Although the above text is from California law, many other jurisdictions, like Florida, have similar laws to prevent escapes from custody.

In 1865, Terry led Union troops to victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in North Carolina. Early life and career Although born in Hartford, Connecticut, Alfred Terry's family quickly moved to New Haven, where he spent most of his childhood. Terry graduated from the Hopkins School in New Haven in 1838. After attending Yale Law School in 1848, Terry became a lawyer and was appointed clerk of the Superior Court of New Haven County. Civil War =South Carolina= When the Civil War started, Terry raised the 2nd Connecticut Infantry Regiment, and was appointed colonel. The regiment fought at First Bull Run, after which Terry and his regiment were transferred to South Carolina. On September 13, 1861, at New Haven, Connecticut, Col. Terry organized an elite and special regiment, 7th Regiment Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, a three-year regiment, naming Joseph Roswell Hawley, who assisted in raising the regiment, as lieutenant colonel. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in April 1862 and placed in command of the Morris Island Division of the X Corps. Terry was heavily involved in the siege operations against Charleston during 1863 and Morris Island, South Carolina. Troops under Terry's direct command were engaged at a skirmish at Grimball's Landing and later succeeded in capturing Fort Wagner in September 1863, but the following year the entire X Corps was sent north to Benjamin Butler's Army of the James in Virginia. =Virginia= Terry's Morris Island Division was redesignated the 1st Division, X Corps, and fought at the Battle of Proctor's Creek and in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign around Richmond. Once the Siege of Petersburg began, Terry continued to fight in the battles north of the James River, notably at the Battle of New Market Heights. Upon the death of X Corps commander David B. Birney in October, Terry briefly assumed command of the corps before it was dissolved. His leadership was never in question, but he had not achieved the same battlefield glory that many of his counterparts had won by this time in the war. =Fort Fisher and North Carolina= Maj. Gen. Alfred Terry (painting/excerpt 1890): leading the Union Army to capture Fort Fisher in January 1865. Terry's greatest achievement of the war came when he was placed in command of the Fort Fisher Expeditionary Corps. Benjamin Butler had previously failed in an expedition against Fort Fisher at the end of 1864. Terry had gained the confidence of General Ulysses S. Grant and was now in command of the ground forces in a second expedition against the fort. Unlike Butler, Terry worked well with the Navy under the command of David D. Porter. On January 13, 1865, Terry sent a division of United States Colored Troops to hold off Confederate forces under Braxton Bragg to the north of Fort Fisher. He sent his other division under Adelbert Ames against the northern part of the fort. After hand-to-hand fighting, the Union troops took control of the fort. For his part in the Battle of Fort Fisher, Terry was promoted to major general of volunteers and brigadier general in the regular army. Reinforcements arrived in February and John M. Schofield arrived to take overall command of the campaign against Wilmington, North Carolina. After the fall of Wilmington, the Fort Fisher Expeditionary Corps was renamed the X Corps, with Terry remaining in command, and participated in the final stages of the Carolinas Campaign. He is generally considered one of the most capable generals with no previous military training to emerge from the war. Postbellum activities Alfred Terry after the war Terry as he appears at the Cape Fear Museum in Wilmington, North Carolina, near which he captured Fort Fisher in 1865. After the war, Terry remained in the military. He helped to negotiate the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), which ended Red Cloud's campaign against American troops in the region. Terry became a strong opponent of the Ku Klux Klan after being assigned as the last military governor of the Third Military District, based in Atlanta, where he served beginning on December 22, 1869. Terry was the commander of the U.S. Army column marching westward into the Montana Territory during what is now popularly known as the Centennial Campaign of 1876‚Äì77. Two other columns marched toward the same objective area (George Crook's from the south and John Gibbon's from the west). A column of troops under his command arrived shortly after the Battle of Little Bighorn and discovered the bodies of Custer's men. In October 1877, he went to Canada to negotiate with Sitting Bull. He was still in command in Montana during the Nez Perce War and sent reinforcements to intercept Chief Joseph. In 1878, Terry joined Maj. Gen. John Schofield on a presidential board asked to reexamine the conviction by court- martial of Fitz John Porter. The board found that Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience. In 1881, as the Northern Pacific Railway's transcontinental rail line was building across Montana, the new town of Terry, Montana was named in his honor. In 1886, Terry was promoted to major general and was given command of the Military Division of the Missouri, headquartered in Chicago. He died four years later in New Haven, Connecticut, where he is buried in Grove Street Cemetery. Media portrayals In 1967, Terry was portrayed by Robert F. Simon (1908‚Äì1992) on the ABC television series Custer. Terry is interpreted by Philippe Noiret in the 1974 franco- italian satyrical Marco Ferreri movie Don't Touch the White Woman!, a farcial, counter-cultural, highly politicized and surreal re-enactment of the run up to the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn In 1991, Terry was portrayed by Terry O'Quinn in the television film Son of the Morning Star.

Mallory by Mathew Brady, between 1855 and 1865 Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 ‚Äì November 9, 1873) was a Democratic senator from Florida from 1851 to the secession of his home state and the outbreak of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. It was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the US Navy should be as capable as those of Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill and guided it through Congress to provide for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession. Although he was not a leader in the secession movement, Mallory followed his state out of the Union. When the Confederate States of America was formed, he was named Secretary of the Navy in the administration of President Jefferson Davis. He held the position throughout the existence of the Confederacy. Because of indifference to naval matters by most others in the Confederacy, Mallory was able to shape the Confederate Navy according to the principles he had learned while serving in the US Senate. Some of his ideas, such as the incorporation of armor into warship construction, were quite successful and became standard in navies around the world. On the other hand, the navy was often handicapped by administrative ineptitude in the Navy Department. During the war, he was weakened politically by a Congressional investigation into the Navy Department for its failure in defense of New Orleans. After months of taking testimony, the investigating committee concluded that it had no evidence of wrongdoing on his part. Mallory resigned after the Confederate government had fled from Richmond at the end of the war, and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He was the father of Stephen Russell Mallory, a U.S. Representative and Senator from Florida. Early life Mallory was born in Trinidad, British West Indies, in 1812.Scharf, Confederate States Navy, p. 29n, states that he was born in 1813. Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, p. 11n, asserts that Mallory in his childhood diary wrote that his age was nine when he began school in 1820. Most historians favor the later date, but they acknowledge that records are lacking. Mallory's tombstone in St. Michael's Cemetery, Pensacola, Florida, gives the year of 1812, but no exact birthdate:http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid;=21357&PIpi;=6333388. His parents were CharlesSome historians (Durkin, Luraghi, Wise) write that the father's given name was John, others (Scharf, Underwood) that it was Charles. Underwood, Mallory, p. 6, has the support of a family tradition. and Ellen Mallory. His father was a construction engineer originally from Redding, Connecticut. He met and married the Irish-born Ellen Russell in Trinidad, and there the couple had two sons. The family moved to the United States and settled in Key West, Florida, in 1820. Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile, Alabama, but his education was interrupted by his father's death. His elder brother John also died about this time. To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was for all of his life a practicing Episcopalian], he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother could no longer afford to pay his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.Luraghi, Confederate States Navy, p. 10.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 14‚Äì15. Adulthood in Florida Young Mallory prepared for a profession by reading law in the office of Judge William Marvin.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, pp. 10‚Äì11. In the absence of law schools, \\"reading law\\" under the tutelage of a practicing member was the customary method of preparing for entry into the profession. Because of its geographical position, Key West was often sought as a port of refuge for ships caught in storms and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks. Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him. He was reputed to be one of the best young trial lawyers in the state.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 31‚Äì32. His career prospering, in 1838 Mallory courted and wed Angela Moreno, a member of a wealthy Spanish-speaking family living in Pensacola. Their marriage produced nine children, five of whom died young; surviving into adulthood were daughters Margaret (\\"Maggie\\") and Ruby, and sons Stephen R. Jr. (\\"Buddy\\"), and Attila (\\"Attie\\"). Buddy followed his father into politics, and he would eventually also serve as U.S. Senator from Florida.Underwood, Mallory, p. 187. Angela Moreno was the cousin of Felix senac, future Confederate Paymaster and agent in Europe, born like her in 1815 in Pensacola. Mallory held a few minor public offices, beginning in 1832 with his selection as town marshal. One of his first paid positions was as Inspector of Customs, for which he earned three dollars per day. Later, President Polk appointed him Collector of Customs. Before his marriage, he joined the Army and took part in the Seminole War, 1835‚Äì1837. He also was elected judge for Monroe County for the years 1837‚Äì1845.Clubbs, Florida Historical Quarterly, vol. 25, no. 3, pp. 232, 235, 236‚Äì237, 240. While serving as judge, the name of the court was changed to Probate Court. In 1850, the sectional differences that eventually culminated in the Civil War led to a convention to be held in Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave- holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 38‚Äì39.Underwood, Mallory, p. 21. In the Senate, 1851‚Äì1861 The term in office of Senator from Florida David Levy Yulee expired in 1850. He sought reappointment, but he had aligned himself too strongly with the Fire-eaters, and also had antagonized some commercial interests in the state. The moderates who favored working within the Union still dominated Florida politics, and they successfully sought to put Mallory in place of the radical Yulee. The selection process in the Florida state legislature was somewhat irregular, and Yulee protested, carrying his protest all the way to the Senate itself. That body determined that the Florida legislature had acted within its authority in certifying Mallory, and so he was seated.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, p. 38‚Äì43, 48‚Äì49.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 22‚Äì25. =Senator from Florida= Much of what he did in the Senate can be described as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 56‚Äì60. =Committee on Naval Affairs= Mallory was placed on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs.His other initial committee assignment was to the minor Committee on Engrossed Bills. Congressional Globe, 32nd Congress, 1st session, p. 32. His assignment became significant when President Millard Fillmore, in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem of what to do with ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.Congressional Globe, 32nd Congress, 1st session, p. 19. Mallory's first major speech in Congress was in favor of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His position was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 52‚Äì55.Mallory's remarks can be read in full: Congressional Globe, 32nd Congress, 1st session, Appendix, pp. 108‚Äì119. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs,After 1853. Underwood, Mallory, p. 29. and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement in the history of the U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War when both men sided with the South.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 70‚Äì83. Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs came during a time of great innovation in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, were in the process of converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the Navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.Tucker, Naval Warfare, pp. 51‚Äì57, 62. One of the first class of frigates, , would later become more closely identified with Mallory's vision of the maritime future. Another innovation that was being considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned while he was in the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 63‚Äì64. =Secession crisis= Representing as he did a state in the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance on the issues that were tearing the nation apart. The occasion arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as \\"probably his most effective speech in the Senate.\\"Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, p. 101. Similarly Underwood, Mallory, p. 38. His speech cannot be termed an oration. Although the language was sometimes floral in the manner of the time, his voice was so low that at one point he had to be interrupted by a request that he speak louder. One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by \\"the people,\\" he said: \\"States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people.\\" He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: \\"It is not for me to indicate the path she [the South] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections.\\"Congressional Globe, 35th Congress, 1st session, p. 1136‚Äì1140 (March 16, 1858). Mallory's revised remarks also can be found in Congressional Globe, 35th Congress, 1st session, Appendix, pp. 214‚Äì218. Despite his willing adherence to the Southern position on the issues that were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordnance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 70‚Äì71. See Congressional Globe, 36th Congress, 2nd session, pp. 485‚Äì486. In the days before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states disagreed over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained in the possession of the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola.Underwood, Mallory, p. 67. Two other forts near Pensacola, Forts Barrancas and McRee, were occupied by Florida militia without incident. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida's other Senator, David L. Yulee, and the two Senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern Senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree. In the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used his perceived pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 68‚Äì70‚Äì73.

Reagan and Robert Toombs The governmental structure of the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much like that of the parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 132‚Äì133. Mallory's nomination as Secretary of the Navy was submitted to the Provisional Congress as soon as the act establishing a navy was passed. Despite his evident qualifications, it drew significant opposition; his detractors cited the Fort Pickens incident as evidence that he was not strongly pro-secession. Ultimately, however, he was confirmed.\\"Cabinet, Confederate States,\\" in Faust, Encyclopedia. The only other cabinet nomination to draw as much opposition was that of Judah P. Benjamin.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 77‚Äì79. =Naval organization and operations= As few other persons in the Confederate government were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department, as well as the navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was very much the product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and Hydrography.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 86‚Äì87. Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title until the end of the war.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, pp. 35‚Äì36. A few other functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.Underwood, Mallory, p. 87. The Torpedo Bureau was headed initially by Mallory's antagonist Matthew F. Maury. At the start, the Confederate Navy faced one of the problems that Mallory had encountered when he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs: an overabundance of high-ranking officers who were too old to go to sea. This came about because the Confederacy had created its navy by promising that men resigning from the U.S. Navy would enter the CS Navy at their old rank. Hoping to avoid the stagnation that was the result of the former promotion process, Mallory proposed that promotion should depend solely on \\"gallant or meritorious conduct during the war.\\"Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, p. 148. His proposal was quickly made into law by the Confederate Congress. Still not completely satisfied, in 1863 Mallory initiated the creation of a Provisional Navy, which in effect established two officer corps. The officers whom Mallory or his advisers deemed incapable of combat were retained in the Regular Navy, while young and presumably more aggressive officers would transfer to the Provisional Navy. Officers for fighting ships would be drawn from the Provisional Navy, and they could be promoted without regard for seniority if they served with distinction.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, p. 284. Mallory also was able to shape naval policy and doctrine. After viewing the disparity between the shipbuilding and other manufacturing facilities of the Confederacy and those of the Union, he set forth a fourfold plan for the navy:Underwood, Mallory, p. 169. :1. Send out commerce raiders to destroy the enemy's mercantile marine. :2. Build ironclad vessels in Southern shipyards for defensive purposes. :3. Obtain by purchase or construction abroad armored ships capable of fighting on the open seas. :4. Employ new weapons and techniques of warfare. =Attacks on Union commerce= From the start, one of the main efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the blockade of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In the early days of the war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, pp. 158‚Äì160.Anderson, By Sea and by River, p. 44. He was more directly involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after the war was over, the smallThe raiders can be counted on one's fingers: , , , , , . group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day.Tucker, Naval Warfare,, p. 110. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.Underwood, Mallory, p. 114.Anderson, By Sea and by River, pp. 212‚Äì214. =Naval reform: ironclads= No other aspect of Mallory's tenure as Secretary of the Navy is better known than his advocacy of armored vessels. He argued that the Confederacy could never produce enough ships to compete with the industrial Union on a ship-by-ship basis. As he saw it, the South should build a few ships that were individually so far superior to their opponents as to dominate. In his words, \\"The perfection of a warship would doubtless be a combination of the greatest known ocean speed with the greatest known floating battery and power of resistance.\\"ORN, ser. II, vol. 2, p. 51. Mallory, Report of the Secretary of the Navy to the President, April 26, 1861. Note that his ideal warship, combining speed, firepower, and armor, was not achieved until the 1930s, at the end of the battleship era. Tucker, Naval Warfare, p. 226. He hoped that armored warships would prove to be the \\"ultimate weapon.\\" He did not anticipate that his opponents would also produce armored vessels, which rapidly became important parts of both navies. Furthermore, other navies, notably Great Britain and France, stepped up the conversions of their own fleets from wood to iron. Certainly, the change was under way even before the Civil War broke out; his legacy consists in forcing the change to be made sooner than would otherwise have been done.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, pp. 68, 89‚Äì90. The first ironclad to be created at Mallory's urgingThe first Confederate ironclad, , was converted by private parties who intended to use her as a privateer. was . The burned and scuttled had been raised at Gosport (Norfolk) Navy Yard, and an armored casemate built on her hull. For armament, she carried 12 guns. She was also fitted with an iron ram. On March 8, 1862, she attacked the Union fleet enforcing the blockade at Hampton Roads, on the James River near Norfolk. She sank two major Union warships ( and ), and menaced a third (), which had grounded in the attempt to get into action. The damages she suffered were negligible. In that first day of the battle, she had demonstrated the basic validity of Mallory's belief that armored warships could destroy the best wooden ships and were almost impervious to damage in return.Underwood, Mallory, p. 99. As is well known, when Virginia returned to battle the next day intending to finish off Minnesota, she encountered the Union's . The two armored vessels fought inconclusively, demonstrating the flaw in Mallory's argument: an ultimate weapon is truly decisive only if one side does not have it.Simson, Naval Strategies, p. 60. After Virginia, most other Confederate ironclads had at best-limited success, and many were complete failures. Particularly embarrassing were four that were contracted to be built for service on the Mississippi River. Of the four, only one, , entered into combat in the way that was intended, with full crew and under steam. Of the others, was destroyed on the stocks; was hastily launched and then burned to avoid capture; and was used merely as an ineffectual floating battery at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, when the fate of New Orleans was decided, and she was then blown up rather than be surrendered. No parties in the Confederacy acquitted themselves well in the three losses, but Mallory must bear a large part of the blame. Poor administration is among the foremost reasons for the delays that hindered completion of the vessels. By failing to prioritize their construction, he allowed Louisiana and Mississippi to compete for scarce resources. Because he did not delegate responsibility, he was swamped with details of the construction of Virginia while letting problems concerning the other ships go unresolved. And because he accepted the role implicitly assigned to his service as secondary to the Army, the Navy had to work with only the materials and funds that were left over after the Army had satisfied its needs.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, pp. 143‚Äì147. =Mission to Europe= The backward condition of shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory that he would have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he thought would be able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.Underwood, Mallory, p. 83.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, pp. 91‚Äì92. Four of the Confederate Navy raiders were purchased in Britain: , , , and above all, . Probably Mallory would have liked to have more, but the record shows that the few that were commissioned were more than adequate.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, pp.217‚Äì233. Efforts to purchase or have built ironclad warships were unsuccessful despite Bulloch's best efforts. Buying them was never seriously considered, as the Royal Navy would not care to give any of its best ships to a foreign power, no matter how favorably disposed. Contracts were made with private shipyards in both Britain and France to build ramsWith little evidence in support, naval theorists in the mid-nineteenth century thought that the primary weapon of armored ships should be a reinforced bow that would enable them to destroy enemy ships by ramming. Ram bows became a standard feature of warships built almost to the start of World War I, although improved gunnery had made them anachronistic almost from the start. Even was often referred to as a ram, as if that were her most significant feature. Tucker, Naval Warfare. pp. 97, 132‚Äì133. to Confederate naval specifications, but their ultimate purpose could not be disguised. They therefore directly violated the neutrality laws, and American (that is, Union) officials immediately informed the governments of their existence. For a while, Her Majesty's Government chose to turn a blind eye on developments, but the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg caused them to reconsider. On September 5, 1863, Ambassador Charles Francis Adams sent a message to Foreign Minister Lord John Russell informing him that the first of the ironclads was about to leave, and that \\"it would be superfluous in me to point out to your Lordship that this means war.\\" The ship was not permitted to leave and was later seized for the Royal Navy. As the French government had implicitly agreed to follow Britain's lead concerning North America, all the contracts were voided.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, pp. 265‚Äì271. =New weapons= The Civil War provided a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was in position to provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name,The cover of Underwood's biography of the man shows his portrait against the backdrop of the battle between the ironclads Monitor and Virginia - or, as it was known even in the Confederacy, as the Battle between the Monitor and Merrimack. but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, as opposed to the smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted to the end of the war.Underwood, Mallory, p. 139. The torpedo office, officially named the Submarine Battery Service,Underwood, Mallory, p. 149. The Torpedo Bureau, with which the Service cooperated, was run by the War Department. developed underwater explosive devices, known as \\"torpedoes\\" at that time but as \\"mines\\" today. The office was initially led by Mallory's enemy Matthew Fontaine Maury, and later by Lieutenant Hunter Davidson. The first ship to be lost to mines was , on December 12, 1862.Luraghi, Confederate Navy, p. 247. Subsequently, more vessels of all types were lost in combat to mines and torpedoes than from all other causes combined.Tucker, Naval Warfare, pp. 167‚Äì168.Durkin, Confederate Navy Chief, p. 264.G. J. Rains, \\"Torpedoes,\\" Southern Historical Society Papers, v. III, p. 256 (1877). In Charleston Harbor, Army Captain Francis D. Lee, supported by General P. G. T. Beauregard, developed a small boat that would carry a spar torpedo. His craft, known as , successfully exploded a torpedo against the side of , severely damaging her.Underwood, Mallory, p. 153. Later, the more famous used one of Lee's spar torpedoes to sink , the first ship to be sunk by a submarine.Most accounts of the Hunley-Housatonic encounter fail to mention that the former was actually traveling on the surface at the time of the attack. See Tucker, Naval Warfare, pp. 177‚Äì178. The Navy Department had not provided active support for Lee's experiments, but their successful result led to the use of spar torpedoes on ships throughout the fleet. (Less favorably for the Rebel cause, spar torpedoes were also immediately adopted by the Union Navy, and one was used in October 1864 to sink the ironclad .)Underwood, Mallory, p. 164. Investigation of the Navy Department The loss of New Orleans came as a tremendous shock to the Confederacy, and a spate of recriminations followed. Members of Congress, noting the failure of the ironclads, blamed the navy in particular, and suggested that there was no need for a separate Navy Department. Hoping to forestall such a proposal, Mallory was able to persuade the Congress instead to investigate the conduct of the department. Each house put five of its members on the investigating committee. The chairman, Senator Clement C. Clay, was known as one of Mallory's friends, as was Representative Ethelbert Barksdale. They were at least partially balanced by Representative Henry S. Foote, a persistent critic of secession and everything that the entire Davis administration had done. Also weighing in against Mallory was Senator Charles M. Conrad, chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, who was not a member of the investigating committee but who did appear as a prosecution witness. The committee continued to meet for more than six months, and ended with no finding of neglect or malfeasance.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 111‚Äì112. The investigation may have weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties, but it was not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because there was no one to replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 174‚Äì178. After the war =Capture and imprisonment= A large part of the population of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 178‚Äì179. For several months, the demand of the public for vengeance increased, so that Mallory feared that he would face the death penalty if convicted. However, no bill of particulars to specify precisely which of his acts constituted treason was ever presented, and it became increasingly clear that no one in the Confederate government was guilty of assassinating the former president. The period for extracting vengeance passed with no one put on trial, and hope was revived. From his prison cell, Mallory began to write letters in a personal campaign to gain release. He petitioned President Andrew Johnson directly, and enlisted the support of some of his former colleagues in the Senate. His wife Angela visited Washington and importuned President Johnson and other persons who had influence. Johnson was already quite lenient in granting pardons, and the popular clamor for harsh punishment began to recede by the end of the year. On March 10, 1866, Johnson granted Mallory a \\"partial parole.\\" Although he was no longer in jail, he was required to stay with his daughter in Bridgeport, Connecticut until he could take the oath of allegiance.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 179‚Äì184. =Release and return to Florida= In June 1866, Mallory visited Washington, where he called on many of his old friends and political adversaries, including President Johnson and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who received him cordially. He got permission to return to Florida; his return was somewhat delayed by problems with his health, but on July 19 he arrived at his home in Pensacola.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 203‚Äì204. By the terms of his parole, Mallory was not permitted to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.Underwood, Mallory, pp. 207‚Äì208. He had long suffered occasional attacks of gout, and these continued to plague him in the postwar years. In the winter of 1871‚Äì1872 he began to complain of his heart, and his health began to deteriorate. Still, he remained active, and the end came rather quickly. He is said to have been \\"listless\\" on November 8, 1873, and that night he began to fail. On the morning of November 9 he died.Underwood, Mallory, p. 210. He was buried in St. Michael's Cemetery, Pensacola, Florida.

Life He was the son of Thomas Harley of Brampton Bryan Castle in Herefordshire and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Andrew Corbet. He entered Oriel College, Oxford in 1595, earning a BA in 1599. He entered Middle Temple in 1599. He was invested as a Knight of the Bath on 25 July 1603. After his first marriage in 1603, he served in various local offices in Herefordshire and Radnorshire, including representing Radnor in Parliament in 1604, Herefordshire in 1624 and 1626 and Evesham in 1628. In 1623 he had married Brilliana, daughter of Sir Edward Conway, one of the Secretaries of State, and acted as his aide in Parliament. He was rewarded for this by being appointed Master of the Mint. He was deprived of this office in 1635 but reinstated in 1643. During this period, his attitude was more that of a country gentleman than of a courtier. In religion (like Brilliana), Harley was a puritan, taking an anti-Catholic and later also anti-Arminian line. He was successively elected to both Parliaments in 1640 (Short Parliament and Long parliament), where he opposed ship money, Laudian ecclesiastical innovations and the Scottish War. This led him to join the Parliamentary party. Harley was in charge of the Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, and presided over the destruction of a great deal of religious art and architecture.Julie Spraggon, Puritan Iconoclasm in England 1640-1660, University of London, 2000 He was an active member of that party both in Parliament and in Herefordshire, Brampton Bryan Castle undergoing siege in 1643 and 1644. On 30 September 1642, Parliamentarians led by Harley and Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford occupied Hereford without opposition.Ron Shoesmith,The Civil War in Hereford (Logaston Press, Almeley, Herefordshire), pp.40 47. In December, they withdrew to Gloucester because of the presence in the area of a Royalist army under Lord Herbert. His support for reconciliation with the king led to his being excluded from the House of Commons in Pride's Purge. He and his son Edward, a colonel in the Parliamentarian army, were imprisoned until after the king's execution. He resigned as Master of the Mint in May 1649 and took no further part in politics. He left several sons, his heir Edward being the father of Queen Anne's Lord Treasurer, Robert Harley, who was raised to the peerage as the Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer.

Early years Crocker was born in Troy, New York on September 16, 1822. He was the son of Eliza (n√©e Wright) and Isaac Crocker, a modest family. They joined the nineteenth-century migration west and moved to Indiana when he was 14, where they had a farm. Crocker soon became independent, working on several farms, a sawmill, and at an iron forge. At the age of 23, in 1845, he founded a small, independent iron forge of his own. He used money saved from his earnings to invest later in the new railroad business after moving to California, which had become a boom state since the Gold Rush. His older brother Edwin B. Crocker had become an attorney by the time Crocker was investing in railroads. Founding a railroad Pacific Railroad Bond, City and County of San Francisco, 1865 The Truckee River at Verdi, Nevada. When the Central Pacific Railroad reached the site in 1868, Charles Crocker pulled a slip of paper from a hat and read the name of Giuseppe Verdi ; so, the town was named after the Italian opera composer. Crocker's mansion on Nob Hill, San Francisco (c. 1880) In 1861, after hearing an intriguing presentation by Theodore Judah, he was one of the four principal investors, along with Mark Hopkins, Collis Huntington and Leland Stanford (also known as The Big Four), who formed the Central Pacific Railroad, which constructed the western portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in North America. His position with the company was that of construction supervisor and president of Charles Crocker & Co., a Central Pacific subsidiary founded expressly for the purpose of building the railroad. Crocker bought train plows to plow the tracks of snow through the mountains, but they derailed due to ice on the tracks. He had more than of snow sheds built to cover the tracks in the Sierra Nevada mountains, to prevent the tracks from getting covered with snow in the winter. This project cost over $2 million.\\"Charles Crocker\\", The West', PBS-WETA In 1864, Charles asked his older brother Edwin to serve as legal counsel for the Central Pacific Railroad. While the Central Pacific was still under construction in 1868, Crocker and his three associates acquired control of the Southern Pacific Railroad. It built the westernmost portion of the second transcontinental railroad. Deming, New Mexico, is named after his wife, Mary Ann Deming Crocker. A silver spike was driven here in 1881 to commemorate the meeting of the Southern Pacific with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads, completing the construction of the second transcontinental railroad in the United States. On September 5, 1876 at the Lang Southern Pacific Station, a California Historic Landmark, Crocker hammered a golden spike into a railroad tie, the ceremonial spike was d to celebrate the completion of San Joaquin Valley rail line. The completion of the line connected the City of Los Angeles with San Francisco and First Transcontinental Railroad line. =Banking= Crocker was briefly the controlling shareholder of Wells Fargo in 1869 and served as president. After he sold down, he was replaced by John J. Valentine, Sr.. Crocker also acquired controlling interest for his son William in Woolworth National Bank, which was renamed Crocker-Anglo Bank. In 1963, Crocker-Anglo Bank merged with Los Angeles' Citizens National Bank, to become Crocker-Citizens Bank and later, Crocker Bank. The San Francisco-based bank no longer exists, as it was acquired by Wells Fargo in 1986. Nob Hill and the 40 foot tall spite fence Crocker built a mansion on Nob Hill. When his attempts to buy out Mr. Nicholas Yung from his property were rebuffed, he built a 40-foot spite fence around three sides of the neighbor's property. Legal challenges to the fence were unavailing. The feud lasted many years, and the fence was only removed after the death of Mrs. Yung, and the sale of the property by Yung's heirs to Crocker's family. Spite fences were thereafter made illegal in San Francisco. The mansion was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Though the disaster rendered the infamous dispute and its resolution moot, Crocker's family donated the entire block of land to charity, in support of the Episcopal Diocese of California. In 1910, in the same plot where the fence stood, the cornerstone was laid for Grace Cathedral. Personal life Painting of Crocker's daughter, Harriet, by Giovanni Boldini, 1887 In 1852, Crocker was married to Mary Ann Deming (1827‚Äì1889). Mary was the daughter of John Jay Deming and Emily (n√©e Reed) Deming. Together, they had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood: * Charles Frederick Crocker (1854‚Äì1897), who married Jennie Ella Easton (1858‚Äì1887). * George Crocker (1856‚Äì1909), who married Emma Hanchett (1855‚Äì1904). * Harriet Valentine Crocker (1859‚Äì1935), who married Charles Beatty Alexander (1849‚Äì1927). * William Henry Crocker (1861‚Äì1937), who married Ethel Sperry (1861‚Äì1934). Crocker was seriously injured in a New York City carriage accident in 1886, never fully recovered, and died two years later on August 14, 1888. He was buried in a mausoleum located on \\"Millionaire's Row\\" at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California. The massive granite structure was designed by the New York architect A. Page Brown, who later designed the San Francisco Ferry Building. Use \\"Crocker\\" as the search text. Crocker's estate has been valued at between $300 million and $400 million at the time of his death in 1888. Crocker's tomb in Mountain View Cemetery =Descendants= Through his son Charles, he was the grandfather of Mary Crocker (1881‚Äì1905), who married U.S. Congressman Francis Burton Harrison; Charles Templeton Crocker (1884‚Äì1948); and Jennie Adeline Crocker (1887‚Äì1974).

He began his career as a Whig, before defecting to a new Tory Ministry. He was raised to the peerage of Great Britain as an earl in 1711. Between 1711 and 1714 he served as Lord High Treasurer, effectively Queen Anne's chief minister. He has been called a Prime Minister,E. S. Roscoe, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, Prime Minister, 1710‚Äì14 (London: Methuen, 1902). although it is generally accepted that the de facto first minister to be a prime minister was Robert Walpole in 1721. The central achievement of Harley's government was the negotiation of the Treaty of Utrecht with France in 1713, which brought an end to twelve years of English and Scottish involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1714 Harley fell from favour following the accession of the first monarch of the House of Hanover, George I, and was for a time imprisoned in the Tower of London by his political enemies. He was also a noted literary figure and served as a patron of both the October Club and the Scriblerus Club. Harley Street is sometimes said to be named after him, although it was his son Edward Harley who actually developed the area. Early life: 1661‚Äì1688 Harley was born in Bow Street, London, in 1661, the eldest son of Sir Edward Harley, a prominent landowner in Herefordshire and his wife Abigail Stephens and the grandson of Sir Robert Harley and his third wife, the celebrated letter-writer Brilliana, Lady Harley. He was educated at Shilton, near Burford, in Oxfordshire, in a small school which produced at the same time a Lord High Treasurer (Harley himself), a Lord High Chancellor (Lord Harcourt) and a Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (Lord Trevor). Harley then spent some time at Foubert's Academy, but disliked it. He entered the Inner Temple on 18 March 1682, but was never called to the bar. The principles of Whiggism and Nonconformism were taught him at an early age, and he never formally abandoned his family's religious opinions, although he departed from them in politics. His father was wrongly imprisoned for suspected support for the 1685 Monmouth rebellion. Harley wrote afterwards that \\"we are not a little rejoiced\\" at Monmouth's defeat.Hill, p. 10. Glorious Revolution: 1688‚Äì1689 During 1688 Harley acted as his father's agent in promoting support for William, Prince of Orange and the Protestant cause against the policies of James II. When William landed in England on 5 November, Sir Edward Harley and his son immediately raised a troop of horse in support of the cause of William III, and took possession of the city of Worcester on his behalf. Harley was sent to report to William, meeting him at Henley. Harley obtained a commission as a major of militia foot in Herefordshire, which he held for several years. Backbench member of parliament: 1689‚Äì1701 This recommended Robert Harley to the notice of the Boscawen family, and led to his election, in April 1689, as the parliamentary representative of Tregony, a borough under their control, whilst at the same time acting as High Sheriff of Herefordshire. He sat for Tregony for one parliament, after which, in 1690, he was elected by the constituency of New Radnor, which he represented until his elevation to the peerage in 1711.House of Commons 1690‚Äì1715 Volume 1 p.244 From an early age, Harley paid particular attention to the conduct of public business, taking special care over the study of the forms and ceremonies of the House of Commons. Harley supported the Toleration Bill during its passage through the Commons and he hoped for \\"an equal settlement of religion\\" to be achieved by the inclusion of Presbyterians in the Church of England. However, this was not adopted.Hill, pp. 17‚Äì18. He also helped to defeat a Tory amendment to the Bill of Rights that would have enabled James II's son James Francis Edward Stuart to inherit the crown if he converted to Protestantism. On 14 May, Harley delivered his maiden speech in which he reminded the House of recent Tory persecutions (such as the harsh punishment of Monmouth's followers) and said that this injustice must be remedied.Hill, p. 18. After a series of French victories in Flanders during the early years of the Nine Years' War, Harley believed that the subordination of English soldiers to Dutch officers was the cause of the heavy English casualties. He therefore proposed a motion that future appointments of English foot regiments should be manned by Englishmen, which the House passed on 23 November 1692.Hill, p. 30. He also opposed Lord Somers' proposed Abjuration Bill. If passed, this would have compelled office-holders to take an oath against recognising James II as the lawful king upon penalty of dismissal and imprisonment on the first refusal, with the penalties of high treason upon the second refusal.Hill, p. 31. During the early 1690s Harley became a leader, second only to Paul Foley, of the 'Old Whigs' who were willing to co-operate with Tories in pursuing 'Country Party' measures against the ministerial or court Whigs in office, the so-called Whig Junto.Hill, p. 26, pp. 33‚Äì34. In December 1690 he was elected to the Commission of Public Accounts to \\"examine, take and state\\" the accounts of the realm since William's accession, as expenditure had ballooned.Hill, p. 24. Harley supported a Bill to exclude from the Commons holders of government office and placemen in an effort to weaken court patronage. In taking part in the debates, Harley wrote: \\"I hope we have shown the parts of honest men and lovers of our country\\". He also supported the Triennial Bill to limit the maximum life of a Parliament to three years. In the Commons in early 1693 he claimed that long parliaments were not as representative as short-lived ones and he drew from his pocket a copy of King William's Declaration of 1688 in which he had promised frequent parliaments.Hill, p. 32. In 1696 Harley advocated the founding of a Land Bank that would serve the agriculture interest as the Bank of England served the monied interest.Hill, pp. 44‚Äì45. After the general election of 1698, Harley emerged as the leader of the combined Country Whig-Tory opposition alliance against the Junto, or what Harley called the 'New Country Party'. Also in this year he began his association with Sidney Godolphin, and through him ultimate entry into the circle around Princess Anne.Hill, p. 55. In November 1698 and in January 1700 Harley was approached by the ministry to accept office in the government, on the latter occasion being offered the Secretaryship of State. He refused on both occasions as he did not want to serve with the Whigs.Hill, p. 58, pp. 59‚Äì60. Upon the death of Anne's only surviving child, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, in July 1700, King William III became concerned with the succession. William believed it was imperative that the crown should go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, or her descendants, should Anne die without child. He wrote to Harley and summoned him to an audience, where he asked Harley what demands the Commons would make in order to be persuaded to pass a Bill incorporating the new line of succession. It was agreed that the Bill would include further limitations of the monarch's power.Hill, p. 63. Afterwards, William approved his election as Speaker of the House of Commons. Speaker of the House of Commons: 1701‚Äì1705 After the general election of February 1701 he held the office of Speaker during three consecutive Parliaments until March 1705. From 18 May 1704 he combined this office with that of the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, displacing The Earl of Nottingham. As Speaker of the first Parliament, Harley oversaw the passage of the Act of Settlement 1701, as previously agreed with King William. Harley was pleased that both the Whigs and the Tories had agreed on placing further limits on the power of the crown and he was reported to have said that \\"he hoped in a little time our infamous distinctions and parties, but particularly Jacobitism, should be wholly abolished and extirpated\\".Hill, p. 66. Northern Secretary: 1704‚Äì1708 Harley was an early practitioner of 'spin'; he recognised the political importance of careful management of the media. In 1703 Harley first made use of Daniel Defoe's talents as a political writer. This proved so successful that he was later to employ both Delarivier Manley and Jonathan Swift to pen pamphlets for him for use against his many opponents in politics. During the time of his office, the union with Scotland was brought about. At the time of his appointment as Secretary of State, Harley had given no outward sign of dissatisfaction with the Whigs, and it was mainly through Marlborough's influence that he was admitted to the ministry. For some time, so long indeed as the victories of the great English general cast a glamour over the policy of his friends, Harley continued to act loyally with his colleagues. But in the summer of 1707 it became evident to Sidney Godolphin that some secret influence behind the throne was shaking the confidence of the Queen in her ministers. The sovereign had resented the intrusion into the administration of the impetuous Lord Sunderland, and had persuaded herself that the safety of the Church of England depended on the fortunes of the Tories. These convictions were strengthened in her mind by the new favourite Abigail Masham (a cousin of the Duchess of Marlborough through her mother, and of Harley on her father's side), whose coaxing contrasted favourably in the eyes of the Queen with the haughty manners of her old friend, the Duchess of Marlborough. Robert Harley by Jonathan Richardson, . Both the Duchess and Godolphin were convinced that this change in the disposition of the queen was due to the influence of Harley and his relatives; but he was permitted to remain in office. Later, an ill-paid and poverty- stricken clerk, William Gregg, in Harley's office, was found to have given the French enemy copies of many documents which should have been kept from the knowledge of all but the most trusted advisers of the court, and it was found that through the carelessness of the head of the department the contents of such papers became the common property of all in his service. The celebrated author Daniel Defoe, then an employee of Harley's, had warned that his lax security was an invitation to treason.DNBO1 reference to William Gregg The Queen was informed by Godolphin and Marlborough that they would no longer serve with Harley. They did not attend her next council, on 8 February 1708, and when Harley proposed to proceed with the business of the day the Duke of Somerset drew attention to their absence. The Queen found herself forced (11 February) to accept the resignations of both Harley and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. Opposition: 1708‚Äì1710 Harley was forced from office, but his cousin Abigail, who had recently married, continued in the Queen's service. Harley employed her influence without scruple, and not in vain. The cost of the protracted war with France, and the danger to the national church, the chief proof of which lay in the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell, were the weapons which he used to influence the masses of the people. Marlborough himself could not be displaced, but his relations were dismissed from their posts in turn. When the greatest of these, Lord Godolphin, was ejected from office on 10 August 1710, five commissioners to the treasury were appointed; among them was Harley as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1710‚Äì1711 It was the aim of the new chancellor to frame an administration from the moderate members of both parties, and to adopt with but slight changes the policy of his predecessors; but his efforts were doomed to disappointment.Hill, p. 131. The Whigs refused to join an alliance with him, and the Tories, who were successful beyond their wildest hopes at the polling booths, could not understand why their leaders did not adopt a policy more favourable to the interests of their party.

The clamours of the wilder spirits, the country members who met at the October Club, began to be re-echoed even by those who were attached to the person of Harley, when, through an unexpected event, his popularity was restored at a bound. A French refugee, the former abb√© La Bourlie (better known by the name of the Marquis de Guiscard), was being examined before the Privy Council of Great Britain on a charge of treason, when he stabbed Harley in the breast with a penknife (8 March 1711). Fortunately for Harley, he had a taste for fine clothes, and on that occasion was wearing an ornate gold brocade waistcoat: it seems that the knife stuck in one of the ornaments. Why Guiscard was allowed to enter the room carrying a weapon is still something of a mystery, but, as the Gregg affair demonstrated, Harley was notoriously lax in matters of security, and it is likely that Guiscard had not been properly searched. To a man in good health the wounds would not have been serious, but the minister had been suffering from ill health and Swift had penned the prayer, \\"Pray God preserve his health, everything depends upon it\\". The joy of the nation on his recovery knew no bounds. Both Houses presented an address to the crown, a suitable response came from the Queen, and on Harley's reappearance in the Lower House the Speaker made an oration which was spread by broadsheet through the country. One of the most pressing problems at this time was the major crisis in public finance caused by the need to pay for the war against France.Hill, p. 134. The architect of Great Britain's finance was Lord Halifax, and he wrote to Harley on the day that the new Treasury board met: \\"Your great abilities and your knowledge of the Revenue, will soon make you master of all the business, but how you will restore credit, and find money for the demands that will be upon you exceeds my capacity\\".Hill, p. 136. Harley in 1711 created the South Sea Company to handle the national debt‚Äîit proved highly successful (at first‚Äîthe notorious \\"bubble\\" began in 1720).Roscoe, 1902, pp 146‚Äì51. He succeeded in restoring confidence under his tenure; whereas the Jacobite invasion scare of 1708 and the alarm caused by the Queen's illness in early 1714 both caused runs on the bank, Godolphin's fall did not precipitate one. Lord High Treasurer: 1711‚Äì1714 On 23 May 1711 the minister became Baron Harley, of Wigmore in the County of Hereford, and Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (the latter, despite its form, being a single peerage). Harley claimed the title of Oxford because of his relationship through marriage to the previous holders, the De Veres. The title of Earl Mortimer was added in case a claim was laid to the Oxford earldom.Hill, p. 152. On 29 May he was appointed Lord Treasurer, and on 25 October 1712 became a Knight of the Garter. A further attempt was made on his life in November with the Bandbox Plot, in which a hat-box, armed with loaded pistols to be triggered by a thread within the package was sent to him; the assassination attempt was forestalled by the prompt intervention of Jonathan Swift. With the sympathy which these attempted assassinations had evoked, and with the skill which the Lord Treasurer possessed for conciliating the calmer members of either political party, he passed several months in office without any loss of reputation. He rearranged the nation's finances, and continued to support her generals in the field with ample resources for carrying on the campaign, though his emissaries were in communication with the French King, and were settling the terms of a peace independently of England's allies. After many weeks of vacillation and intrigue, when the negotiations were frequently on the point of being interrupted, the preliminary peace was signed, and in spite of the opposition of the Whig majority in the House of Lords, which was met by the creation of twelve new peers nicknamed Harley's Dozen, the much-vexed Treaty of Utrecht was brought to a conclusion on 31 March 1713. The Whig cry of \\"No Peace Without Spain\\", was not sufficient to block Parliamentary approval of the Treaty. Robert Harley pictured carrying the white staff of the Lord High Treasurer. Portrait by Jonathan Richardson. While these negotiations were under discussion, the friendship between Harley (Oxford) and St John, the latter who had become Secretary of State in September 1710, was fast changing into hatred. The latter had resented the rise in fortune which the stabs of Guiscard had secured for his colleague Harley, and when he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron St John and Viscount Bolingbroke, instead of with an Earldom, his resentment knew no bounds. The royal favourite, Abigail, whose husband had been called to the Upper House as Baron Masham, deserted her old friend and relation for his more vivacious rival. The Jacobites found that, although the Lord Treasurer was profuse in his expressions of good will for their cause, no steps were taken to ensure its triumph, and they no longer placed reliance in promises which were repeatedly made and repeatedly broken. Even Harley's (Oxford's) friends began to complain of his dilatoriness, and to find some excuse for his apathy in ill-health, aggravated by excess in the pleasures of the table and by the loss of his favourite child. The confidence of Queen Anne was gradually transferred from Oxford to Bolingbroke; on 27 July 1714 the former surrendered his staff as lord treasurer, and on 1 August the queen died. Imprisonment: 1715‚Äì1717 On the accession of George I of Great Britain, the defeated minister retired to Herefordshire, but a few months later his impeachmentEarl of Oxford and E. Mortimer impeached. at the journal of the House of Lords. was decided upon and he was committed to the Tower of London on 16 July 1715. He was accused of high treason and high crimes and misdemeanors, with the death penalty a distinct possibly. Many of the charges related to his negotiation of the Treaty of Utrecht. Further charges were added regarding his alleged secret plotting with the Jacobite claimant James.Hill p.227-228 His political allies St John and Ormonde both fled to France before they could be arrested on similar grounds and entered the service of James. Initially he was in ill health, suffering from pneumonia and was cared for by his wife Sarah who remained with him during the first weeks of his imprisonment.Hill p.228 Not long after he was detained a major Jacobite Rising occurred and was defeated. Interrogators of Jacobite prisoners tried to discover if there was a connection with Harley in the plan, but none could be established.Hill p.229 This significantly delayed Harley's trial, as priority was given to the leading rebels, several of whom were executed. This may have benefited him as the angry mood amongst Whigs against him had calmed by 1717.Hill p.229 Harley also benefited from the Whig Split between rival factions led by James Stanhope and Robert Walpole. Walpole and his supporters went into opposition and joined with the Tories to attack Stanhope's government on many issues. After an imprisonment of nearly two years, was formally acquitted from the charges of high treason and high crimes and misdemeanours for which he had been impeached two years earlier, and allowed to resume his place among the peers. Later life: 1717‚Äì1724 Immediately following his release Oxford was informed by George I that he was no longer welcome at court.Hill p.230 He joined with the Tory lords to oppose the new Whig Oligarchy in Parliament, in alliance with the Opposition Whigs. In 1719 they joined together in opposition to Stanhope's Peerage Bill which was defeated. After this Lord Oxford increasingly took little part in public affairs, and died almost unnoticed in London on 21 May 1724. Literary importance Harley's importance to literature cannot be overstated. As a patron of the arts, he was notable. As a preservationist, he was invaluable. He used his wealth and power to collect an unparalleled library. He commissioned the creation of ballad collections, such as The Bagford Ballads, and he purchased loose poems from all corners. He preserved Renaissance literature (particularly poetry), Anglo-Saxon literature that was then incomprehensible, and a great deal of Middle English literature. His collection, with that of his son Edward, 2nd Lord Oxford and Mortimer, was sold to Parliament in 1753 for the British Museum by the Countess of Oxford and Countess Mortimer and her daughter, the Duchess of Portland; it is known as the Harley Collection.Illuminated manuscripts: a guide to the British Library‚Äôs collections British Library Illuminated Manuscripts; The Foundation Collections When he was in office, Harley promoted the careers of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and John Gay. He also wrote with them as a member of the Scriblerus Club. He, along with The 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, contributed to the literary productions of the Club. His particular talent lay in poetry, and some of his work (always unsigned) has been preserved and may be found among editions of Swift's poetry. Additionally, he likely had some hand in the writing of The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, though it is impossible to tell how much. In the opinion of the historian David C. Douglas, in Harley's time \\"the whole company of scholars looked up to Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, as the great Maecenas of English medieval learning, and they were right to do so, for he was the correspondent and benefactor of very many of them, and he deserved their gratitude as surely as he earned through his book-collecting the thanks of posterity\\".David C. Douglas, English Scholars. 1660‚Äì1730. Second, revised edition (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1951), p. 263. Family Brampton Bryan Hall In May 1685 Harley married as his first wife Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Foley, and they had four children before she died in November 1691: They were the sixth great-grandparents of Queen Elizabeth II via her mother, the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and their eldest son, Edward. * Abigail (1685?-15 July 1750), who married George Hay, later 8th Earl of Kinnoull in 1709. * Edward (2 June 1689-16 June 1741), who married Henrietta Cavendish Holles and succeeded as 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer; Fifth great-grandfather to Queen Elizabeth II via her mother, the Queen Mother Elizabeth. * Elizabeth (2 June 1689-20 November 1713), who married Peregrine Osborne, later 3rd Duke of Leeds in 1712; and * Robert, who died in infancy in 1690.

It was operating from Bangkok (Bangkok International Airport, now renamed Don Mueang International Airport) to Taipei with a stopover in Hong Kong. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (registration , was operated by subsidiary Mandarin Airlines on behalf of China Airlines. While landing during a typhoon, it touched down hard, flipped over and caught fire. Of the 315 people on board, 312 survived and three were killed. It was the first fatal accident to occur at the new Hong Kong International airport since it opened in 1998. Flight 642 was one of only two hull losses of MD-11s with passenger configuration, the other being Swissair Flight 111, which crashed in 1998 with 229 fatalities. All other hull losses of MD-11s have been when the aircraft has been serving as a cargo aircraft.  Aircraft and crew  Seating plan The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 registered as B-150, which had been delivered to China Airlines in 1992 and was leased to Mandarin Airlines in 1993. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney PW4460 turbofan engines. The captain was 57-year-old Gerardo Lettich, an Italian national who had joined China Airlines in 1997, and had previously flown for a major European airline. He had 17,900 flight hours, including 3,260 hours on the MD-11. The first officer was 36-year-old Liu Cheng-hsi, a Taiwanese national who had been with the Airline since 1989 and had logged 4,630 flight hours, with 2,780 of them on the MD-11.  Summary  track of Tropical Storm Sam At about 6:43 P.M. local time (1043 UTC) on 22 August 1999, the MD-11 was making its final approach to runway 25L when Tropical Storm Sam was NE of the airport. At an altitude of prior to touchdown a further wind check was reported to the crew: 320 deg/ gusting to . This resulted in a crosswind vector of gusting to , while the tested limit for the aircraft was . During the final flare to land, the plane rolled to the right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing separated from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to roll over and skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and the rear of the plane was on fire, coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 3500 ft from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway from the nose of the plane. As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport. Rescue vehicles quickly arrived on the scene and suppressed the fire on and in the vicinity of the aeroplane, allowing rescue of the passengers and crew to progress in very difficult conditions. Two passengers rescued from the wreckage were certified dead on arrival at hospital and one passenger died five days later in hospital. A total of 219 persons, including crewmembers, were admitted to hospital, of whom 50 were seriously injured and 153 sustained minor injuries. All 15 crew members survived.  Investigation  The final report of the accident blamed it mainly on pilot error, specifically the inability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at altitude on the radar altimeter. The descent rate at touch down was . The flight data stored in the volatile memory of the aircraft's Quick Access Recorder (QAR) during the last of the approach could not be recovered due to the interruption of the power supply at impact. Probable wind variations and the loss of headwind component, together with the early retardation of thrust levers, led to a loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. Due to the severe weather conditions forecast for Hong Kong, the flight crew had prepared to divert the flight to Taipei if the situation at Hong Kong was deemed unsuitable for landing. Extra fuel was carried for this possibility, resulting in a landing weight of , 99.897% of its maximum landing weight of . Based on the initial weather and wind check which was passed along to the crew from Hong Kong during the flight, they believed they could land there and decided against a diversion to Taipei. However four earlier flights had carried out missed approaches at Hong Kong and five had diverted. During the final approach, the plane descended along the Instrument Landing System (ILS) glideslope until at about , the crew visually acquired the runway. They disengaged the autopilot but left the autothrottle on. During the flare, the rate of descent was not arrested, the plane landed with the right wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the fuselage. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the grass strip next to the runway. The spilled fuel caught fire. Several suggestions were given to China Airlines concerning its training. However China Airlines disputed the report's findings on the flight crews' actions, citing the weather conditions at the time of the accident and claimed that the aircraft flew into a microburst just before landing, causing it to crash.  Aftermath  The route continues to operate today with the flight no longer originating in Bangkok and is strictly a Hong Kong-Taipei route. Bangkok-Hong Kong service ended on 31 October 2010. The route is now flown by a Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A330-300.  Media  The landing and crash of Flight 642 was recorded by nearby occupants in a car. The video which also captured reactions from the witnesses has been uploaded to websites such as YouTube and Airdisaster.com. A photo showing another Mandarin Airlines MD-11 taxiing past the remains of Flight 642 was circulated. This disaster was also aired on RTHK's Elite Brigade II Episode 2 in 2012.

That eloquent youth had been sent of late from the lands of the Gauls to learn the laws of the Roman courts. My son in affection and kinsman by blood, he holds the fondest ties of my regard. Even now his father Exuperantius trains the Armoric sea-board to love the recovery of peace; he re-establishes the laws, brings freedom back and suffers not the inhabitants to be their servants' slaves.\\" Exuperantius was apparently praefectus praetorio Galliarum (\\"Praetorian prefect of the Gallic provinces\\") when he was killed in an army mutiny at Arles in 424. Palladius was married and had a young daughter. He is described as a friend and younger kinsman by Namatianus. In Rome, he kissed his family goodbye in the manner of the Apostles, and lived as an ascetic in Sicily around 408/409, giving his daughter to a convent on that island. He seems to have been ordained as a priest around 415. He lived in Rome between 418-429, and appears to be the \\"Deacon Palladius\\", responsible for urging Pope Celestine I to send the bishop Germanus to Britain, where he guided \\"the Britons back to the Catholic faith.\\"Stokes, G.T., \\"Palladias, bishop of Ireland\\", Dictionary of Early Christian Biography, (Henry Wace, ed.), John Murray and Co., London, 1911 Prosper of Aquitaine describes Palladius as a deacon. Butler and P.F. Moran say that Palladius was a Deacon of Rome, as it is unlikely that a deacon of Auxerre would exercise the influence in Rome that many have assigned to Palladius; and that it is in accordance with St Prosper's usage to indicate the Roman deacon by the simple title \\"diaconus.\\" Historian Kathleen Hughes regards it as more probable that he was a deacon of St Germanus, and that Germanus sent him to Rome,Hughes, Kathleen. \\"The church in Irish society, 400-800\\", A New History of Ireland: Prehistoric and early Ireland, (Daibhi O Croinin, ed.) Oxford University Press, 1976, , p. 302 where he received a commission from the Holy See for Germanus to travel to Britain in response to a request from the bishops there for assistance in combatting Pelagianism. Ireland In 431, \\"Palladius, having been ordained by Pope Celestine, is sent as first bishop to the Scotti believing in Christ\\", according to the Chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine.Entry for AD 431 Chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine Palladius landed at Arklow. Auxilius, Secundinus, and Iserninus are missioners identified with St. Patrick, but more recent research associates them not with Patrick but with Palladius.Stalmans, Nathalie and T.M. Charles- Edwards. \\"Meath, saints of\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Irish writers who chronicled the life of St Patrick state that St Palladius preached in Ireland before St Patrick, although he was soon banished by the King of Leinster, and returned to North Britain.Butler, Rev. Alban, \\"St Palladius, Bishop and Confessor, Apostle of the Scots\\", The Lives of the Saints, Vol.VII, 1866 According to Muirchu (who lived two centuries later) in the Book of Armagh, God hindered him...and neither did those fierce and cruel men receive his doctrine readily, nor did he himself wish to spend time in a strange land, but returned to him who sent him. Palladius was accompanied by four companions: Sylvester and Solinus, who remained after him in Ireland, and Augustinus and Benedictus, who followed him to Britain but returned to their own country after his death.Cusack, Margaret Anne, \\"Mission of St. Palladius\\", An Illustrated History of Ireland, Chapter VIII, 1868 Palladius is most strongly associated with Leinster, particularly with Clonard, County Meath. St Palladius Church, Fordoun Scotland According to St Prosper, Palladius arrived among the Scots in North Britain (in the consulate of Bassus and Antiochus) after he left Ireland in 431. Scottish church tradition holds that he presided over a Christian community there for about 20 years. A cluster of dedications in the Mearns in Scotland, in the village of Auchenblae, are believed to mark his last resting place. As late as the reign of James V, royal funds were disbursed for the fabrication of a new reliquary for the church there, and an annual \\"Paldy Fair\\" was held at least until the time of the Reformation. Death His date of death is unknown; however, the Annals of Ulster contain the following references: * 457 \\"Repose of the elder Patrick, as some books state\\" * 461 \\"Here some record the repose of Patrick\\" * 492 \\"The Irish state here that Patrick the Archbishop died.\\" * 493 \\"Patrick... apostle of the Irish, rested on the 16th day before the Kalends of April...\\" Thus, it is possible that later writers confused Palladius and Patrick. If the earlier dates of 457/461 indeed refer to him, then it seems that the actual St Patrick died much later about 492/493. Patrick's mission was largely confined to Ulster and Connacht, while Palladius seems to have been active in Leinster, particularly in the area around Clonard. The Vita tripartita states that he died at Cell Fine (thought to be modern-day Killeen Cormac, County Kildare), where he left his books, writing tablet and relics of Peter and Paul. Alban Butler, citing Hector Boethius and Camden, says that he died at Fordun, fifteen miles south of Aberdeen, around the year 450.

They released their acclaimed debut LP Frequencies in 1991 on Sheffield label Warp. After Varley left the group in 1996, Bell continued solo to release Advance (1996) and Sheath (2003). Bell died in October 2014, effectively ending the project. LFO are considered to be pioneers of the bass- heavy \\"bleep techno\\" style. AllMusic called them \\"one of British techno's most important, agenda-setting groups.\\" History Varley and Bell met while studying at Leeds and named their group after the initialism for the common synthesizer function low-frequency oscillation. They gave their first track, the eponymous \\"LFO\\", to Nightmares on Wax. The popularity of the demo in clubs led to the track being released by the Sheffield-based Warp label in 1990, and it was a Top 20 hit in the U.K., reaching number 12 in the singles charts in July. In 1991, LFO released the debut album, Frequencies. DJ Martin (Martin Williams) is credited as a cowriter and coproducer of the track \\"LFO\\" but was not a member of the group.

News Corp's Chairman and Founder is Rupert Murdoch. The Australian integrates content from overseas newspapers owned by News Corp Australia's international parent News Corp, including The Wall Street Journal and The Times of London.  History  The first edition of The Australian was published by Rupert Murdoch on 15 July 1964, becoming the third national newspaper in Australia following shipping newspaper Daily Commercial News (1891) and Australian Financial Review (1951). Unlike other original Murdoch newspapers, it is not a tabloid publication. At the time, a national paper was considered commercially unfeasible, as newspapers mostly relied on local advertising for their revenue. The Australian was printed in Canberra, then plates flown to other cities for copying. From its inception the paper struggled for financial viability and ran at a loss for several decades. A Sunday edition, The Sunday Australian, was established in 1971.Events and issues that made the news in 1971 , National Archives of Australia However, it was discontinued in 1972 because there was insufficient press capacity to print it as well as The Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Mirror.Time for a change , The Australian, 2014 The Australian's first editor was Maxwell Newton, before leaving the newspaper within a year, and was succeeded by Walter Kommer, and then by Adrian Deamer. Under his editorship The Australian encouraged female journalists, and was the first mainstream daily newspaper to hire an Aboriginal reporter, John Newfong. During the 1975 election, campaigning against the Whitlam government by its owner led to the newspaper's journalists striking over editorial direction. Editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell was appointed in 2002 and retired on 11 December 2015; he was replaced by Paul Whittaker formerly the editor-in-chief of Sydney's Daily Telegraph. In May 2010, the newspaper launched the first Australian newspaper iPad app. In October 2011, The Australian announced that it was planning to become the first general newspaper in Australia to introduce a paywall, with the introduction of a $2.95 per week charge for readers to view premium content on its website, mobile phone and tablet applications. The paywall was officially launched on 24 October, with a free 3-month trial. In September 2017, The Australian launched a Chinese website. In October 2018, it was announced that Chris Dore, former editor of The Daily Telegraph, ‚Äò'The Courier-Mail'‚Äô and ‚Äò'The Sunday Times'‚Äô would be taking over as editor-in-chief.  Coverage  Daily sections include National News (The Nation) followed by Worldwide News (Worldwide), Sport and Business News (Business). Contained within each issue is a prominent op/ed section, including regular columnists and non-regular contributors. Other regular sections include Technology (AustralianIT), Media (edited by Darren Davidson since 2015), Features, Legal Affairs, Aviation, Defence, Horse-Racing (Thoroughbreds), The Arts, Health, Wealth and Higher Education. A Travel & Indulgence section is included on Saturdays, along with The Inquirer, an in- depth analysis of major stories of the week, alongside much political commentary. Saturday lift-outs include Review, focusing on books, arts, film and television, and The Weekend Australian Magazine, the only national weekly glossy insert magazine. A glossy magazine, Wish, is published on the first Friday of the month. \\"The Australian has long maintained a focus on issues relating to Aboriginal disadvantage.\\" It also devotes attention to the information technology, Defence and mining industries, as well as the science, economics, and politics of climate change. It has also published numerous \\"special reports\\" into Australia's energy policy, legal affairs and research sector. The Australian Literary Review was a monthly supplement from September 2006 to October 2011. The tone and nature of the Australian's coverage has changed over time, but since the late 20th century under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch and with Chris Mitchell as editor-in-chief, it has taken a markedly conservative direction. It was outspoken in supporting the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard.  Editorial and opinion pages  Former editor Paul Kelly stated in 1991 that \\"The Australian has established itself in the marketplace as a newspaper that supports economic libertarianism\\". Laurie Clancy asserted in 2004 that the newspaper \\"is generally conservative in tone and heavily oriented toward business; it has a range of columnists of varying political persuasions but mostly to the right.\\" Former editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell has said that the editorial and op-ed pages of the newspaper are centre-right but \\"claims it is down the middle in its news coverage\\". Mitchell, Chris (9 March 2006). The Media Report . Australian Broadcasting Company. https://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/26/crikey-bias-o-meter-the-newspapers/ In 2007, Crikey described the newspaper as generally in support of the Liberal Party and the then-Coalition government, but has pragmatically supported Labor governments in the past as well. In 2007, The Australian announced their support for the Rudd Australian Labor Party in the Federal election. The Australian presents varying views on climate change, including articles by those who disagree with the scientific consensus such as Ian Plimer, and authors who agree with the scientific consensus such as Tim Flannery and Bj√∏rn Lomborg. A 2011 study of the previous seven years of articles claimed that four out of every five articles were opposed to taking action on climate change. In 2010 the ABC's Media Watch presenter Paul Barry accused The Australian of waging a campaign against the Australian Greens, and the Greens' federal leader Bob Brown wrote that The Australian has \\"stepped out of the fourth estate by seeing itself as a determinant of democracy in Australia\\". In response, The Australian opined that \\"Greens leader Bob Brown has accused The Australian of trying to wreck the alliance between the Greens and Labor. We wear Senator Brown's criticism with pride. We believe he and his Green colleagues are hypocrites; that they are bad for the nation; and that they should be destroyed at the ballot box\\". The Australian has been described by some media commentators and scholars as working to promote a right-wing agenda and, as a result, encouraging political polarisation in Australia. In 2019, former The Australian journalist Rick Morton reported the paper \\"fuels far- right recruitment\\" through dog whistle coded language. Notable stories =AWB kickback scandal= Caroline Overington, a senior journalist writing for The Australian reported in 2005 about the Australian Wheat Board funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to Iraq and the government of Saddam Hussein before the start of the Iraq War. This story became known as the AWB oil-for- wheat scandal, and resulted in a commission of inquiry into the matter. Overington received a Walkley award for her coverage. =Stimulus Watch= In 2009, The Australian ran many articles about the Rudd Government's Building the Education Revolution policy, which uncovered evidence of over-pricing, financial waste and mismanagement of the building of improvements to schools such as halls, gymnasiums and libraries. On the newspaper's website, there was a section named \\"Stimulus Watch\\", subtitled \\"How your Billions Are Being Spent\\", which contained a large collection of such articles. The following year, other media outlets also reported these issues and the policy turned into a political embarrassment for the government, which until then had been able to ignore The Australians reports. Along with the government's insulation stimulus policy, it contributed to criticisms, perceptions of incompetence and general dissatisfaction with the government's performance. On 16 July 2010, it was reported that Julia Gillard had admitted that the school-building program was flawed and that errors had been made because the program was designed in haste to protect jobs during the global financial crisis. =AWU Affair= In 2011, Glenn Milne reported on the allegations against Prime Minister Julia Gillard concerning the AWU affair including a claim regarding Gillard's living arrangements with Australian Workers' Union official Bruce Wilson. Gillard contacted the chief executive of The Australian, resulting in the story being removed and an apology and retraction posted in its place. On 18 August 2012, Hedley Thomas reported that Gillard had left her job as a partner with law firm Slater and Gordon as a direct result of a secret internal investigation in 1995 into corrupt conduct on behalf of her then-boyfriend Ralph Blewett. The story was ignored for a long time by other media outlets until after Gillard held a press conference to respond to the allegations against her. In 2013 the Fair Work Commission commenced initial inquiries into allegations of improper union financial conduct, and the government initiated a judicial inquiry into the AWU affair in December of that year as part of a royal commission into trade unions. =The Teacher‚Äôs Pet= The Teachers Pet, an investigation into the disappearance of Lynette Dawson, is a podcast written by Hedley Thomas and Slade Gibson that ran in 2018. It was credited with generating new leads that led to the subsequent arrest of Chris Dawson for the murder of his wife, and the setting up of police enquiry Strike Force Southwood to explore claims of sexual assaults and student-teacher relationships at several Sydney high schools brought up on the podcast. The series has had 28 million downloads, was the number one Australian podcast and reached number one in the UK, Canada and New Zealand. Both Hedley and Gibson received Gold Walkley awards for their work on the series.  Columnists and contributors  Former columnists include Mike Steketee, David Burchell, Michael Stutchbury, Simon Adamek, George Megalogenis, Glenn Milne, Cordelia Fine, Alan Wood, Michael Costa, P. P. McGuinness, Michael Costello, Frank Devine, Matt Price and Christopher Pearson. Former cartoonists include Bill Leak.

Colebatch, Luke Slattery, Noel Pearson, Bettina Arndt, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott and Lucian Boz.  Australian of the Year Award  In 1971, The Australian instituted their own \\"Australian of the Year award\\" separate and often different from the Australian of the Year chosen by the government's National Australia Day Council. Starting in 1968, the official award had long had links to the Victorian Australia Day Council, and at the time there was a public perception it was state based. As a national newspaper, The Australian felt they were better situated to create an award that more truly represented all of Australia. Nominees are suggested by readers, decided upon by an editorial board, and awarded in January of every year. Circulation In the June quarter of 2013, the average print circulation for The Australian on weekdays was 116,655 and 254,891 for The Weekend Australian. Both were down (9.8 and 10.8%) compared to the June quarter the previous year. As of March 2015, the weekday edition circulation was 104,165 and the weekend edition was 230,182, falling 6.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively compared to the same period in 2014. The Australian had 67,561 paid digital subscribers in the same period. As of August 2015, according to third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, The Australians website was the 72nd and 223rd most visited website in Australia respectively. SimilarWeb rates the site as the 23rd most visited news website in Australia, attracting almost 3 million visitors per month. In September 2018, according to Roy Morgan Research, The Australian had a readership of 303,000. In September 2019, Roy Morgan reported figures of 843,000 (Sep 2018 ‚Äì 810,000) for the print version (total, Weekend and weekday editions); digital versions 1,903, 000 (Sep 2018 ‚Äì 1,812,000); total cross-platform 2,394,000 (Sep 2018 ‚Äì 2,503,000); down 4.4%. (By way of comparison, The Sydney Morning Herald total figure was 4,209,000; The Age (Melbourne) 2,852,000, Herald Sun (Melbourne) 2,801,000. The only other nationally distributed daily newspaper, the business-focused Australian Financial Review, had 1,599,000 cross-platform readers (up 17.7%).)

Their range includes golf and ski clothing, polo shirts, training clothes, jackets, suits, and shirts. History =Founding= Johan Lindeberg founded the J.Lindeberg brand in 1996. Lindeberg, who had been the marketing director of Diesel, resigned from his duties at the Italian denim brand, where he had been fatigued from constantly restraining his own visions, and decided that he wanted to create something of his own. Whilst traveling through Europe on his motorcycle, he visualized a fashion brand that reflected his personal and creative values. Lindeberg launched his brand during the summer of 1996 in Stockholm and New York simultaneously. The brand was named J.Lindeberg after Lindeberg‚Äôs own signature. With a number of investors, and Lindeberg committing all his financial resources, two parallel offices where assembled, one in Stockholm‚Äôs port district and one on 57th street Manhattan in New York. As Creative Director, Lindeberg assembled a small team of designers headed by Roland Hjort, who was recruited from the Swedish apparel brand H&M.; =21st Century Lifestyle= The first design concept was called 21st Century Lifestyle, and the collection was showcased in New York during the Fashion Week Fall Winter 1997 Season, featuring men‚Äôs fashion and golf clothing. Lindeberg has always expressed a profound interest in active sports and the idea of transforming elements and ideas from the high fashion industry into sportswear. Since he had a past in one of the world's largest denim manufactures, it would have been obvious for him to build his brand around denim products, but Johan didn‚Äôt want J.Lindeberg to be labeled a denim brand. Therefore, he initially did no denim and instead he presented a 1960s rock 'n' roll-inspired look. To further develop the golf concept, Lindeberg turned to his PGA-tour golfer Jesper Parnevik. Parnevik's character suited J.Lindeberg‚Äôs creative concept, and added a professional value to the collections. =Critical acclaim= J.Lindeberg steadily gained momentum and became critically acclaimed by key figures in the fashion industry and early adopters on the streets. The first official award came in 1999, when Swedish Elle presented J.Lindeberg with the \\"Designer of the Year\\" award. The following year (2000) J.Lindeberg received the \\"Guldknappen\\" (golden button) award as \\"Most Innovative Designer\\". Later in 2000, J.Lindeberg opened its first flagship store in central Stockholm. Several more concept stores followed shortly in New York City, Tokyo, Yokohama and Los Angeles. By 2002, J.Lindeberg's annual turnover had reached 219 million Swedish kronor, selling at 500 stores worldwide. Lindeberg decided to feature his collections for the first time as a part of official New York Fashion Week Schedule in Bryant Park. At this point, J.Lindeberg took a serious step onto the international high-end fashion scene, and became the first Scandinavian brand to be featured in several international fashion editorials. J.Lindeberg has been worn on several official occasions by Bono from U2, Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher, The Killers, and Jane's Addiction, among others. In mid-2002, Lindeberg and his wife Marcella, whom he met at Diesel, permanently relocated to London to set up a base for J.Lindeberg's international marketing operations and a UK showroom with the purpose of expanding the brand in one of largest fashion markets in Europe. Short thereafter, the first women's collection was revealed under the supervision of Marcella. Lindeberg also announced that J.Lindeberg would for the first time present a full denim concept for both men and women. After appearing at the Milano Moda Uomo Fashion week, work began on reconstructing J.Lindeberg's worldwide stores to also carry the women's collection. As work began on the women's collection Lindeberg revealed his new complement to the J.Lindeberg, the J.Lindeberg Future Sports. This concept fused futuristic attitudes and elements with retrospective design visions of the future, such as the Lamborghini race cars of the early 1990s. Apart from a full men's and women's collection J.Lindeberg Future Sports also carried a completely new store concept and the first store opened in central Stockholm. The season after its initiation the Future Sports Concept produced the first J.Lindeberg Ski Collection that was showcased together with the Fall/Winter 2005 season in Milan. The face of J.Lindeberg Ski became the renowned Swedish free skier Jon Olsson. The J.Lindeberg Ski collection was exhibited at ISPO-fair in Germany where it won the \\"Newcomer of the Year\\" award. More concept collections would appear the following years, including, swimwear, sunglasses and shoes. =Restructuring= In 2007, the decreasing profitability of the company had begun to put heavy pressure on the relationship between Lindeberg and J.Lindeberg's major shareholders. The issues were resolved when the capital investment firm Proventus became the new principal owner of J.Lindeberg with Stefan Engstr√∂m, who also became the company‚Äôs new CEO. Before committing to J.Lindeberg, Engstr√∂m had been one of the co-founders of Swedish sports apparel brand Peak Performance, which had grown to become one of Sweden‚Äôs largest fashion exports. In the wake of the restructure Lindeberg expressed a wish to become more creatively sovereign, weary his increasing administrative assignments Lindeberg wanted to focus on the creative concept of the brand and the inspiration of the collections. He returned to the role of Creative Director and relocated with Marcella back to New York. The J.Lindeberg Ski Collection had been reintroduced, headed by Fredrik Dahl who used to be the design director at \\"The North Face\\". J.Lindeberg's retail stores were remade by the French/Swedish architect Albert Francois Lenoard. The first of the new store concepts to open was the Flagship Store on in central Stockholm. Pierangelo D'Agostin was reappointed as Design Director with the responsibility of all concepts. He had been design director at Jil Sander and his own Japanese luxury brand hLam. =Today= Since 2012 J.Lindeberg has been owned by Anders Holch Povlsen (founder and owner of Bestseller), Dan Friis, Allan Warburg (also co-owners of Bestseller China) and Stefan Engstr√∂m. The company has expanded globally and now also has a Chinese business. There are over 215 branded stores and shop in shops worldwide and yearly brand sales of approximately 1.6 BN SEK per year. In 2017, Stefan Engstr√∂m decided to leave the role as CEO and was replaced by the company‚Äôs CFO, Johan Mark. Stefan Engstr√∂m however still continues to play an active role within the company. J.Lindeberg continues to offer Fashion, Golf, Ski and Active Wear collections. The design head office of all collections is situated in Stockholm where the international design team sits. In January 2016, Johan Lindeberg came back to the company on a 2 year assignment in the role of Creative Consultant. For 2017 the brand has its sights set on digital expansion into North and South America and recently launched in Canada www.jlindebergusa.com David Feiner, acting Director of eCommerce says, \\"we believe there is a huge opportunity to capture the Canadian market, and we see the online channel as a catalyst.

In United States history, the term scalawag (sometimes spelled scallawag or scallywag) referred to white Southerners who supported Reconstruction policies and efforts after the conclusion of the American Civil War. As with the term carpetbagger, the word has a long history of use as a slur in Southern partisan debates. The opponents of the scalawags claimed they were disloyal to traditional values.Ted Tunnell. 2006. Creating \\"The Propaganda of History\\": Southern Editors and the Origins of \\"Carpetbagger and Scalawag\\". The Journal of Southern History , Vol. 72, No. 4 (Nov., 2006), pp. 789‚Äì822 The term is commonly used in historical studies as a descriptor of Southern white Republicans, although some historians have discarded the term due to its history of pejorative connotations.Jack P. Maddex. 1980. More Facts of Reconstruction The Day of the Carpetbagger: Republican Reconstruction in Mississippi. by William C. Harris Jr. Reviews in American History, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Mar., 1980), pp. 69‚Äì73 Origins of the term The term is a derogatory epithet, yet it is used by many historians anyway, as in Wiggins (1991), Baggett (2003), Rubin (2006) and Wetta (2012). The word scalawag, originally referring to low-grade farm animals, was adopted by their opponents to refer to Southern whites who formed a Republican coalition with black freedmen and Northern newcomers (called carpetbaggers) to take control of their state and local governments. Among the earliest uses in this new meaning were references in Alabama and Georgia newspapers in the summer of 1867, first referring to all Southern Republicans, then later restricting it to only white ones. Historian Ted Tunnel writes that > Reference works such as Joseph E. Worcester's 1860 Dictionary of the > Caribbean Spanish Language defined scalawag as \\"A low worthless fellow; a > scapegrace.\\" Scalawag was also a word for low-grade farm animals. In early > 1868 a Mississippi editor observed that scalawag \\"has been used from time > immemorial to designate inferior milch cows in the cattle markets of > Virginia and Kentucky.\\" That June the Richmond Enquirer concurred; scalawag > had heretofore \\"applied to all of the mean, lean, mangy, hidebound skiny > [sic], worthless cattle in every particular drove.\\" Only in recent months, > the Richmond paper remarked, had the term taken on political meaning. During the 1868‚Äì69 session of Judge \\"Greasy\\" Sam Watts' court in Haywood County, North Carolina, Dr. William Closs, D.D. testified that a scalawag was \\"a Native born Southern white man who says he is no better than a negro and tells the truth when he says it\\". Some accounts record his testimony as \\"a native Southern white man, who says that a negro is as good as he is, and tells the truth when he says so\\". By October 1868 a Mississippi newspaper was defining the expression scathingly in terms of Redemption politics.\\"A Mississippi newspaper gives this pointed description ... 'The carpet-bagger is a Northern thief who comes South to plunder every white man who is a gentleman of any property or respectability, and get all the offices he can. The scalawag is a Southern-born scoundrel, who will do all the carpet-bagger will, and, besides, murder the carpet-bagger for the gutta-percha ring his sister gave him when he left home. The Times, 8 October 1868, p.9 The term continued to be used as a pejorative by conservative pro-segregationist southerners well into the 20th century.Tucker, William H. (2002), The Funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund, University of Illinois Press, p. 59 But historians commonly use the term to refer to the group of historical actors with no pejorative meaning intended.Richard D. Starnes. \\"Forever Faithful: The Southern Historical Society and Confederate Historical Memory\\". Southern Cultures, Volume 2, Number 2, Winter 1996, pp. 177‚Äì194, note 2 History After the American Civil War during the Reconstruction Era 1863 to 1869, Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson undertook policies designed to bring the South back to normal as soon as possible, while the Radical Republicans used Congress to block the president, impose harsh terms, and upgrade the rights of the Freedmen (the ex-slaves). In the South, Black Freedmen and White Southerners with Republican sympathies joined forces with Northerners who had moved south (called \\"Carpetbaggers\\" by their southern opponents) to implement the policies of the Republican party. Despite being a minority, scalawags gained power by taking advantage of the Reconstruction laws of 1867, which disenfranchised the majority of Southern white voters as they could not take the Ironclad oath, which required they had never served in Confederate armed forces or held any political office under the state or Confederate governments. Historian Harold Hyman says that in 1866 Congressmen \\"described the oath as the last bulwark against the return of ex-rebels to power, the barrier behind which Southern Unionists and Negroes protected themselves.\\"Harold Hyman, To try men's souls: loyalty tests in American history (1959) p 93 The coalition controlled every former Confederate state except Virginia, as well as Kentucky and Missouri (which were claimed by the North and the South) for varying lengths of time between 1866 and 1877. Two of the most prominent scalawags were General James Longstreet, one of Robert E. Lee's top generals, and Joseph E. Brown, who had been the wartime governor of Georgia. During the 1870s, many scalawags left the Republican Party and joined the conservative-Democrat coalition. Conservative Democrats had replaced all Republican minority governments in the South by 1877, after the disputed presidential election of 1876, in which the remaining Reconstruction governments had certified the Republican electors despite the Democratic candidate having carried the states. Historian John Hope Franklin gives an assessment of the motives of Southern Unionists. He noted that as more Southerners were allowed to vote and participate:Franklin p. 100 > A curious assortment of native Southerners thus became eligible to > participate in Radical Reconstruction. And the number increased as the > President granted individual pardons or issued new proclamations of amnesty > ... Their primary interest was in supporting a party that would build the > South on a broader base than the plantation aristocracy of Antebellum days. > They found it expedient to do business with Negroes and so-called > carpetbaggers, but often they returned to the Democratic party as it gained > sufficient strength to be a factor in Southern politics. Eventually most scalawags joined the Democratic Redeemer coalition. A minority persisted as Republicans and formed the \\"tan\\" half of the \\"Black and Tan\\" Republican party. It was a minority element in the GOP in every Southern state after 1877.DeSantis 1998 Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the South were edited by scalawags‚Äîonly 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers. White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage.Stephen L. Vaughn, ed., Encyclopedia of American journalism (2007) p 441.Richard H. Abbott, For Free Press and Equal Rights: Republican Newspapers in the Reconstruction South (2004). =Alabama= In Alabama, Wiggins says scalawags dominated the Republican Party. Some 117 Republicans were nominated, elected, or appointed to the most lucrative and important state executive positions, judgeships, and federal legislative and judicial offices between 1868 and 1881. They included 76 white southerners, 35 northerners, and 6 former slaves. In state offices during Reconstruction, white southerners were even more predominant: 51 won nominations, compared to 11 carpetbaggers and one black. 27 scalawags won state executive nominations (75%), 24 won state judicial nominations (89%), and 101 were elected to the Alabama General Assembly (39%). However, fewer scalawags won nominations to federal offices: 15 were nominated or elected to Congress (48%) compared to 11 carpetbaggers and 5 blacks. 48 scalawags were members of the 1867 constitutional convention (49.5% of the Republican membership); and seven scalawags were members of the 1875 constitutional convention (58% of the minuscule Republican membership.)Wiggins 131‚Äì38 In terms of racial issues, Wiggins says: > White Republicans as well as Democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly > rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary, even then > reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were > predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white > Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican party in Alabama, as > elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political > party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members > from Democratic terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, > verbally and physically.\\" =South Carolina= In South Carolina there were about 100,000 scalawags, or about 15% of the white population. During its heyday, the Republican coalition attracted some wealthier white southerners, especially moderates favoring cooperation between open-minded Democrats and responsible Republicans. Rubin shows that the collapse of the Republican coalition came from disturbing trends to corruption and factionalism that increasingly characterized the party's governance. These failings disappointed Northern allies who abandoned the state Republicans in 1876 as the Democrats under Wade Hampton reasserted control. They used the threat of violence to cause many Republicans to stay quiet or switch to the Democrats.Rubin 2006 =Louisiana= Wetta shows that New Orleans was a major Scalawag center. Their leaders were well-to-do well- educated lawyers, physicians, teachers, ministers, businessmen, and civil servants. Many had Northern ties or were born in the North, moving to the boom city of New Orleans before the 1850s. Few were cotton or sugar planters. Most had been Whigs before the War, but many had been Democrats. Nearly all were Unionists during the War. They had joined a Republican coalition with blacks but gave at best weak support to black suffrage, black office holding, or social equality. Wetta says that their \\"cosmopolitanism broke the mold of southern provincialism\\" typical of their southern-democratic opponents. That is, scalawags had \\"a broader worldview.\\"Frank J. Wetta, The Louisiana Scalawags: Politics, Race, and Terrorism during the Civil War and Reconstruction (Louisiana State University Press, 2012) p 184 =Mississippi= The most prominent scalawag of all was James L. Alcorn of Mississippi. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865, but like all southerners was not allowed to take a seat while the Republican Congress was pondering Reconstruction. He supported suffrage for freedmen and endorsed the Fourteenth Amendment, as demanded by the Republicans in Congress. Alcorn became the leader of the scalawags, who composed about a third of the Republicans in the state, in coalition with carpetbaggers and freedmen. Elected governor by the Republicans in 1869, he served from 1870 to 1871. As a modernizer he appointed many like-minded former Whigs, even if they were Democrats. He strongly supported education, including public schools for blacks only, and a new college for them, now known as Alcorn State University. He maneuvered to make his ally Hiram Revels its president. Radical Republicans opposed Alcorn and were angry at his patronage policy. One complained that Alcorn's policy was to see \\"the old civilization of the South modernized\\" rather than lead a total political, social and economic revolution.Quoted in Eric Foner, Reconstruction (1988) p 298. Alcorn resigned the governorship to become a U.S. Senator (1871‚Äì1877), replacing his ally Hiram Revels, the first African American senator. Senator Alcorn urged the removal of the political disabilities of white southerners, rejected Radical Republican proposals to enforce social equality by federal legislation, he denounced the federal cotton tax as robbery and defended separate schools for both races in Mississippi. Although a former slaveholder, he characterized slavery as a cancer upon the body of the Nation and expressed the gratification which he and many other Southerners felt over its destruction.Congressional Globe, 42 Cong., 2 Sess., pp. 246‚Äì47, 2730‚Äì33, 3424 Alcorn led a furious political battle with Senator Adelbert Ames, the carpetbagger who led the other faction of the Republican Party in Mississippi. The fight ripped apart the party, with most blacks supporting Ames, but many‚Äîincluding Revels, supporting Alcorn. In 1873, they both sought a decision by running for governor. Ames was supported by the Radicals and most African Americans, while Alcorn won the votes of conservative whites and most of the scalawags. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490, and Alcorn retired from state politics.Pereyra 1966 Newton Knight has gained increased attention since the 2016 release of the feature film Free State of Jones. =Mountains= The mountain districts of Appalachia were often Republican enclaves.McKinney 1998 People there held few slaves, and they had poor transportation, deep poverty, and a standing resentment against the Low Country politicians who dominated the Confederacy and conservative Democrats in Reconstruction and after. Their strongholds in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, western Virginia and North Carolina, and the Ozark region of northern Arkansas, became Republican bastions. These rural folk had a long-standing hostility toward the planter class. They harbored pro-Union sentiments during the war. Andrew Johnson was their representative leader. They welcomed Reconstruction and much of what the Radical Republicans in Congress advocated. =Outside the US= The term 'scally' is also used in the United Kingdom to refer to elements of the working class and petty criminality, in a similar vein to the more contemporary chav. In Philippines, scalawags were used to denote rogue police or military officers. Accusations of corruption Scalawags were denounced as corrupt by Redeemers. The Dunning School of historians sympathized with the claims of the Democrats. Agreeing with the Dunning School, Franklin said that the scalawags \\"must take at least part of the blame\\" for graft and corruption.Franklin, p. 101 The Democrats alleged the scalawags to be financially and politically corrupt, and willing to support bad government because they profited personally. One Alabama historian claimed: \\"On economic matters scalawags and Democrats eagerly sought aid for economic development of projects in which they had an economic stake, and they exhibited few scruples in the methods used to push beneficial financial legislation through the Alabama legislature. The quality of the book keeping habits of both Republicans and Democrats was equally notorious.\\"Wiggins p 134 However, historian Eric Foner argues there is not sufficient evidence that scalawags were any more or less corrupt than politicians of any era, including Redeemers.Foner, Reconstruction Who were the scalawags? White Southern Republicans included formerly closeted Southern abolitionists as well as former slaveowners who supported equal rights for freedmen. (The most famous of this latter group was Samuel F. Phillips, who later argued against segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson.) Included, too, were people who wanted to be part of the ruling Republican Party simply because it provided more opportunities for successful political careers. Many historians have described scalawags in terms of social class, showing that on average they were less wealthy or prestigious than the elite planter class. As Thomas Alexander (1961) showed, there was persistent Whiggery (support for the principles of the defunct Whig Party) in the South after 1865. Many ex-Whigs became Republicans who advocated modernization through education and infrastructure‚Äîespecially better roads and railroads. Many also joined the Redeemers in their successful attempt to replace the brief period of civil rights promised to African Americans during the Reconstruction era with the Jim Crow era of segregation and second-class citizenship that persisted into the 20th century.

The Purkinje fibers are specialised conducting fibers composed of electrically excitable cells that are larger than cardiomyocytes with fewer myofibrils and many mitochondria and which (cells) conduct cardiac action potentials more quickly and efficiently than any other cells in the heart.\\"Purkinje fiber.\\" The American Heritage¬Æ Medical Dictionary. 2007. Houghton Mifflin Company 23 Oct. 2016 http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Purkinje+fiber Purkinje fibers allow the heart's conduction system to create synchronized contractions of its ventricles, and are, therefore, essential for maintaining a consistent heart rhythm. Histology Purkinje fiber just beneath the endocardium. Purkinje fibers are a unique cardiac end-organ. Further histologic examination reveals that these fibers are split in ventricles walls. The electrical origin of atrial Purkinje fibers arrives from the sinoatrial node. Given no aberrant channels, the Purkinje fibers are distinctly shielded from each other by collagen or the cardiac skeleton. The Purkinje fibers are further specialized to rapidly conduct impulses (having numerous fast voltage-gated sodium channels and mitochondria, and fewer myofibrils, than the surrounding muscle tissue). Purkinje fibers take up stain differently from the surrounding muscle cells because of having relatively fewer myofibrils than other cardiac cells. The presence of glycogen around the nucleus causes Purkinje fibers to appear, on a slide, lighter and larger than their neighbors, being arranged along the longitudinal direction (parallel to the cardiac vector). They are often binucleated cells. Function Heart rate is governed by many influences from the autonomic nervous system. The Purkinje fibers do not have any known role in setting heart rate unless the SA node is compromised. They are influenced by electrical discharge from the sinoatrial node. During the ventricular contraction portion of the cardiac cycle, the Purkinje fibers carry the contraction impulse from both the left and right bundle branch to the myocardium of the ventricles. This causes the muscle tissue of the ventricles to contract and generate force to eject blood out of the heart, either to the pulmonary circulation from the right ventricle or to the systemic circulation from the left ventricle. Purkinje fibers also have the ability of firing at a rate of 15-40 beats per minute if upstream conduction or pacemaking ability is compromised. In contrast, the SA node in normal state can fire at 60-100 beats per minute. In short, they generate action potentials, but at a slower rate than the sinoatrial node. This capability is normally suppressed. Thus, they serve as the last resort when other pacemakers fail. When a Purkinje fiber does fire, it is called a premature ventricular contraction or PVC, or in other situations can be a ventricular escape. It plays a vital role in the circulatory system.

In motion capture sessions, movements of one or more actors are sampled many times per second. Whereas early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate 3D positions,Cheung, German KM, et al. \\"A real time system for robust 3D voxel reconstruction of human motions.\\" Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2000. Proceedings. IEEE Conference on. Vol. 2. IEEE, 2000. often the purpose of motion capture is to record only the movements of the actor, not their visual appearance. This animation data is mapped to a 3D model so that the model performs the same actions as the actor. This process may be contrasted with the older technique of rotoscoping, as seen in Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings (1978) and American Pop (1981). This method works by tracing over a live-action actor, capturing the actor's motions and movements. To explain, an actor is filmed performing an action, and then the recorded film is projected onto an animation table frame- by-frame. Animators trace the live-action footage onto animation cels, capturing the actor's outline and motions frame-by-frame, and then they fill in the traced outlines with the animated character. The completed animation cels are then photographed frame-by-frame, exactly matching the movements and actions of the live-action footage. The end result of which is that the animated character replicates exactly the live-action movements of the actor. However, this process takes a considerable amount of time and effort. Camera movements can also be motion captured so that a virtual camera in the scene will pan, tilt or dolly around the stage driven by a camera operator while the actor is performing. At the same time, the motion capture system can capture the camera and props as well as the actor's performance. This allows the computer-generated characters, images and sets to have the same perspective as the video images from the camera. A computer processes the data and displays the movements of the actor, providing the desired camera positions in terms of objects in the set. Retroactively obtaining camera movement data from the captured footage is known as match moving or camera tracking. Advantages Motion capture offers several advantages over traditional computer animation of a 3D model: * Low latency, close to real time, results can be obtained. In entertainment applications this can reduce the costs of keyframe-based animation. The Hand Over technique is an example of this. * The amount of work does not vary with the complexity or length of the performance to the same degree as when using traditional techniques. This allows many tests to be done with different styles or deliveries, giving a different personality only limited by the talent of the actor. * Complex movement and realistic physical interactions such as secondary motions, weight and exchange of forces can be easily recreated in a physically accurate manner. * The amount of animation data that can be produced within a given time is extremely large when compared to traditional animation techniques. This contributes to both cost effectiveness and meeting production deadlines. *Potential for free software and third party solutions reducing its costs. Disadvantages * Specific hardware and special software programs are required to obtain and process the data. * The cost of the software, equipment and personnel required can be prohibitive for small productions. * The capture system may have specific requirements for the space it is operated in, depending on camera field of view or magnetic distortion. * When problems occur, it is easier to shoot the scene again rather than trying to manipulate the data. Only a few systems allow real time viewing of the data to decide if the take needs to be redone. * The initial results are limited to what can be performed within the capture volume without extra editing of the data. * Movement that does not follow the laws of physics cannot be captured. * Traditional animation techniques, such as added emphasis on anticipation and follow through, secondary motion or manipulating the shape of the character, as with squash and stretch animation techniques, must be added later. * If the computer model has different proportions from the capture subject, artifacts may occur. For example, if a cartoon character has large, oversized hands, these may intersect the character's body if the human performer is not careful with their physical motion. Applications Motion capture performers from Buckinghamshire New University Video games often use motion capture to animate athletes, martial artists, and other in-game characters.Jon Radoff, Anatomy of an MMORPG, This has been done since the Sega Model 2 arcade game Virtua Fighter 2 in 1994. By mid-1995 the use of motion capture in video game development had become commonplace, and developer/publisher Acclaim Entertainment had gone so far as to have its own in-house motion capture studio built into its headquarters. Namco's 1995 arcade game Soul Edge used passive optical system markers for motion capture. Movies use motion capture for CG effects, in some cases replacing traditional cel animation, and for completely computer-generated creatures, such as Gollum, The Mummy, King Kong, Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean, the Na'vi from the film Avatar, and Clu from Tron: Legacy. The Great Goblin, the three Stone-trolls, many of the orcs and goblins in the 2012 film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and Smaug were created using motion capture. Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (1999) was the first feature-length film to include a main character created using motion capture (that character being Jar Jar Binks, played by Ahmed Best), and Indian- American film Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of Mists (2000) was the first feature- length film made primarily with motion capture, although many character animators also worked on the film, which had a very limited release. 2001's Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was the first widely released movie to be made primarily with motion capture technology. Despite its poor box-office intake, supporters of motion capture technology took notice. Total Recall (1990 film) had already used the technique, in the scene of the x-ray scanner and the skeletons. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was the first feature film to utilize a real-time motion capture system. This method streamed the actions of actor Andy Serkis into the computer generated skin of Gollum / Smeagol as it was being performed. Out of the three nominees for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, two of the nominees (Monster House and the winner Happy Feet) used motion capture, and only Disney¬∑Pixar's Cars was animated without motion capture. In the ending credits of Pixar's film Ratatouille, a stamp appears labelling the film as \\"100% Pure Animation ‚Äì No Motion Capture!\\" Since 2001, motion capture is being used extensively to simulate or approximate the look of live-action cinema, with nearly photorealistic digital character models. The Polar Express used motion capture to allow Tom Hanks to perform as several distinct digital characters (in which he also provided the voices). The 2007 adaptation of the saga Beowulf animated digital characters whose appearances were based in part on the actors who provided their motions and voices. James Cameron's highly popular Avatar used this technique to create the Na'vi that inhabit Pandora. The Walt Disney Company has produced Robert Zemeckis's A Christmas Carol using this technique. In 2007, Disney acquired Zemeckis' ImageMovers Digital (that produces motion capture films), but then closed it in 2011, after a box office failure of Mars Needs Moms. Television series produced entirely with motion capture animation include Laflaque in Canada, Sprookjesboom and ' in The Netherlands, and Headcases in the UK. Virtual reality and Augmented reality providers, such as uSens and Gestigon, allow users to interact with digital content in real time by capturing hand motions. This can be useful for training simulations, visual perception tests, or performing a virtual walk-throughs in a 3D environment. Motion capture technology is frequently used in digital puppetry systems to drive computer generated characters in real-time. Gait analysis is one application of motion capture in clinical medicine. Techniques allow clinicians to evaluate human motion across several biomechanical factors, often while streaming this information live into analytical software. Some physical therapy clinics utilize motion capture as an objective way to quantify patient progress. During the filming of James Cameron's Avatar all of the scenes involving this process were directed in realtime using Autodesk MotionBuilder software to render a screen image which allowed the director and the actor to see what they would look like in the movie, making it easier to direct the movie as it would be seen by the viewer. This method allowed views and angles not possible from a pre-rendered animation. Cameron was so proud of his results that he invited Steven Spielberg and George Lucas on set to view the system in action. In Marvel's The Avengers, Mark Ruffalo used motion capture so he could play his character the Hulk, rather than have him be only CGI as in previous films, making Ruffalo the first actor to play both the human and the Hulk versions of Bruce Banner. FaceRig software uses facial recognition technology from ULSee.Inc to map a player's facial expressions and the body tracking technology from Perception Neuron to map the body movement onto a 3D or 2D character's motion onscreen. During Game Developers Conference 2016 in San Francisco Epic Games demonstrated full-body motion capture live in Unreal Engine. The whole scene, from the upcoming game Hellblade about a woman warrior named Senua, was rendered in real-time. The keynote was a collaboration between Unreal Engine, Ninja Theory, 3Lateral, Cubic Motion, IKinema and Xsens. Methods and systems Reflective markers attached to skin to identify body landmarks and the 3D motion of body segments Silhouette tracking Motion tracking or motion capture started as a photogrammetric analysis tool in biomechanics research in the 1970s and 1980s, and expanded into education, training, sports and recently computer animation for television, cinema, and video games as the technology matured. Since the 20th century the performer has to wear markers near each joint to identify the motion by the positions or angles between the markers. Acoustic, inertial, LED, magnetic or reflective markers, or combinations of any of these, are tracked, optimally at least two times the frequency rate of the desired motion. The resolution of the system is important in both the spatial resolution and temporal resolution as motion blur causes almost the same problems as low resolution. Since the beginning of the 21st century and because of the rapid growth of technology new methods were developed. Most modern systems can extract the silhouette of the performer from the background. Afterwards all joint angles are calculated by fitting in a mathematic model into the silhouette. For movements you can't see a change of the silhouette, there are hybrid Systems available who can do both (marker and silhouette), but with less marker. In robotics, some motion capture systems are based on simultaneous localization and mapping.Sturm, J√ºrgen, et al. \\"A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems.\\" Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on. IEEE, 2012. Optical systems Optical systems utilize data captured from image sensors to triangulate the 3D position of a subject between two or more cameras calibrated to provide overlapping projections. Data acquisition is traditionally implemented using special markers attached to an actor; however, more recent systems are able to generate accurate data by tracking surface features identified dynamically for each particular subject. Tracking a large number of performers or expanding the capture area is accomplished by the addition of more cameras. These systems produce data with three degrees of freedom for each marker, and rotational information must be inferred from the relative orientation of three or more markers; for instance shoulder, elbow and wrist markers providing the angle of the elbow. Newer hybrid systems are combining inertial sensors with optical sensors to reduce occlusion, increase the number of users and improve the ability to track without having to manually clean up data. =Passive markers= A dancer wearing a suit used in an optical motion capture system Markers are placed at specific points on an actor's face during facial optical motion capture. Passive optical systems use markers coated with a retroreflective material to reflect light that is generated near the cameras lens. The camera's threshold can be adjusted so only the bright reflective markers will be sampled, ignoring skin and fabric. The centroid of the marker is estimated as a position within the two- dimensional image that is captured. The grayscale value of each pixel can be used to provide sub-pixel accuracy by finding the centroid of the Gaussian. An object with markers attached at known positions is used to calibrate the cameras and obtain their positions and the lens distortion of each camera is measured. If two calibrated cameras see a marker, a three-dimensional fix can be obtained. Typically a system will consist of around 2 to 48 cameras. Systems of over three hundred cameras exist to try to reduce marker swap. Extra cameras are required for full coverage around the capture subject and multiple subjects. Vendors have constraint software to reduce the problem of marker swapping since all passive markers appear identical. Unlike active marker systems and magnetic systems, passive systems do not require the user to wear wires or electronic equipment. Instead, hundreds of rubber balls are attached with reflective tape, which needs to be replaced periodically. The markers are usually attached directly to the skin (as in biomechanics), or they are velcroed to a performer wearing a full body spandex/lycra suit designed specifically for motion capture. This type of system can capture large numbers of markers at frame rates usually around 120 to 160 fps although by lowering the resolution and tracking a smaller region of interest they can track as high as 10000 fps. =Active marker= Active optical systems triangulate positions by illuminating one LED at a time very quickly or multiple LEDs with software to identify them by their relative positions, somewhat akin to celestial navigation. Rather than reflecting light back that is generated externally, the markers themselves are powered to emit their own light. Since inverse square law provides one quarter the power at two times the distance, this can increase the distances and volume for capture. This also enables high signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in very low marker jitter and a resulting high measurement resolution (often down to 0.1 mm within the calibrated volume). The TV series Stargate SG1 produced episodes using an active optical system for the VFX allowing the actor to walk around props that would make motion capture difficult for other non-active optical systems. ILM used active markers in Van Helsing to allow capture of Dracula's flying brides on very large sets similar to Weta's use of active markers in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The power to each marker can be provided sequentially in phase with the capture system providing a unique identification of each marker for a given capture frame at a cost to the resultant frame rate. The ability to identify each marker in this manner is useful in realtime applications. The alternative method of identifying markers is to do it algorithmically requiring extra processing of the data. There are also possibilities to find the position by using coloured LED markers. In these systems, each colour is assigned to a specific point of the body. One of the earliest active marker systems in the 1980s was a hybrid passive-active mocap system with rotating mirrors and colored glass reflective markers and which used masked linear array detectors. =Time modulated active marker= A high-resolution uniquely identified active marker system with 3,600 √ó 3,600 resolution at 960 hertz providing real time submillimeter positions Active marker systems can further be refined by strobing one marker on at a time, or tracking multiple markers over time and modulating the amplitude or pulse width to provide marker ID. 12 megapixel spatial resolution modulated systems show more subtle movements than 4 megapixel optical systems by having both higher spatial and temporal resolution. Directors can see the actors performance in real time, and watch the results on the motion capture driven CG character. The unique marker IDs reduce the turnaround, by eliminating marker swapping and providing much cleaner data than other technologies. LEDs with onboard processing and a radio synchronization allow motion capture outdoors in direct sunlight, while capturing at 120 to 960 frames per second due to a high speed electronic shutter. Computer processing of modulated IDs allows less hand cleanup or filtered results for lower operational costs. This higher accuracy and resolution requires more processing than passive technologies, but the additional processing is done at the camera to improve resolution via a subpixel or centroid processing, providing both high resolution and high speed. These motion capture systems are typically $20,000 for an eight camera, 12 megapixel spatial resolution 120 hertz system with one actor. IR sensors can compute their location when lit by mobile multi-LED emitters, e.g. in a moving car. With Id per marker, these sensor tags can be worn under clothing and tracked at 500 Hz in broad daylight. =Semi-passive imperceptible marker= One can reverse the traditional approach based on high speed cameras. Systems such as Prakash use inexpensive multi-LED high speed projectors. The specially built multi-LED IR projectors optically encode the space. Instead of retro-reflective or active light emitting diode (LED) markers, the system uses photosensitive marker tags to decode the optical signals. By attaching tags with photo sensors to scene points, the tags can compute not only their own locations of each point, but also their own orientation, incident illumination, and reflectance. These tracking tags work in natural lighting conditions and can be imperceptibly embedded in attire or other objects. The system supports an unlimited number of tags in a scene, with each tag uniquely identified to eliminate marker reacquisition issues. Since the system eliminates a high speed camera and the corresponding high- speed image stream, it requires significantly lower data bandwidth. The tags also provide incident illumination data which can be used to match scene lighting when inserting synthetic elements. The technique appears ideal for on-set motion capture or real-time broadcasting of virtual sets but has yet to be proven. =Underwater motion capture system= Motion capture technology has been available for researchers and scientists for a few decades, which has given new insight into many fields. Underwater cameras The vital part of the system, the underwater camera, has a waterproof housing. The housing has a finish that withstands corrosion and chlorine which makes it perfect for use in basins and swimming pools. There are two types of cameras. Industrial high-speed-cameras can also be used as infrared cameras. The infrared underwater cameras comes with a cyan light strobe instead of the typical IR light‚Äîfor minimum falloff under water and the high-speed-cameras cone with an LED light or with the option of using image processing. Underwater motion capture camera Motion tracking in swimming by using image processing =Measurement volume= An underwater camera is typically able to measure 15‚Äì20 meters depending on the water quality, the camera and the type of marker used. Unsurprisingly, the best range is achieved when the water is clear, and like always, the measurement volume is also dependent on the number of cameras. A range of underwater markers are available for different circumstances. =Tailored= Different pools require different mountings and fixtures. Therefore, all underwater motion capture systems are uniquely tailored to suit each specific pool installment. For cameras placed in the center of the pool, specially designed tripods, using suction cups, are provided. =Markerless= Emerging techniques and research in computer vision are leading to the rapid development of the markerless approach to motion capture. Markerless systems such as those developed at Stanford University, the University of Maryland, MIT, and the Max Planck Institute, do not require subjects to wear special equipment for tracking. Special computer algorithms are designed to allow the system to analyze multiple streams of optical input and identify human forms, breaking them down into constituent parts for tracking. ESC entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers Pictures created specially to enable virtual cinematography, including photorealistic digital look-alikes for filming The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions movies, used a technique called Universal Capture that utilized 7 camera setup and the tracking the optical flow of all pixels over all the 2-D planes of the cameras for motion, gesture and facial expression capture leading to photorealistic results. Traditional systems Traditionally markerless optical motion tracking is used to keep track on various objects, including airplanes, launch vehicles, missiles and satellites. Many of such optical motion tracking applications occur outdoors, requiring differing lens and camera configurations. High resolution images of the target being tracked can thereby provide more information than just motion data. The image obtained from NASA's long-range tracking system on space shuttle Challenger's fatal launch provided crucial evidence about the cause of the accident. Optical tracking systems are also used to identify known spacecraft and space debris despite the fact that it has a disadvantage compared to radar in that the objects must be reflecting or emitting sufficient light. An optical tracking system typically consists of three subsystems: the optical imaging system, the mechanical tracking platform and the tracking computer. The optical imaging system is responsible for converting the light from the target area into digital image that the tracking computer can process. Depending on the design of the optical tracking system, the optical imaging system can vary from as simple as a standard digital camera to as specialized as an astronomical telescope on the top of a mountain. The specification of the optical imaging system determines the upper-limit of the effective range of the tracking system. The mechanical tracking platform holds the optical imaging system and is responsible for manipulating the optical imaging system in such a way that it always points to the target being tracked. The dynamics of the mechanical tracking platform combined with the optical imaging system determines the tracking system's ability to keep the lock on a target that changes speed rapidly. The tracking computer is responsible for capturing the images from the optical imaging system, analyzing the image to extract target position and controlling the mechanical tracking platform to follow the target. There are several challenges. First the tracking computer has to be able to capture the image at a relatively high frame rate. This posts a requirement on the bandwidth of the image capturing hardware. The second challenge is that the image processing software has to be able to extract the target image from its background and calculate its position. Several textbook image processing algorithms are designed for this task. This problem can be simplified if the tracking system can expect certain characteristics that is common in all the targets it will track. The next problem down the line is to control the tracking platform to follow the target. This is a typical control system design problem rather than a challenge, which involves modeling the system dynamics and designing controllers to control it. This will however become a challenge if the tracking platform the system has to work with is not designed for real-time. The software that runs such systems are also customized for the corresponding hardware components. One example of such software is OpticTracker, which controls computerized telescopes to track moving objects at great distances, such as planes and satellites. Another option is the software SimiShape, which can also be used hybrid in combination with markers. Non-optical systems =Inertial systems= Inertial motion capture technology is based on miniature inertial sensors, biomechanical models and sensor fusion algorithms. The motion data of the inertial sensors (inertial guidance system) is often transmitted wirelessly to a computer, where the motion is recorded or viewed. Most inertial systems use inertial measurement units (IMUs) containing a combination of gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer, to measure rotational rates. These rotations are translated to a skeleton in the software. Much like optical markers, the more IMU sensors the more natural the data. No external cameras, emitters or markers are needed for relative motions, although they are required to give the absolute position of the user if desired. Inertial motion capture systems capture the full six degrees of freedom body motion of a human in real-time and can give limited direction information if they include a magnetic bearing sensor, although these are much lower resolution and susceptible to electromagnetic noise. Benefits of using Inertial systems include: capturing in a variety of environments including tight spaces, no solving, portability, and large capture areas. Disadvantages include lower positional accuracy and positional drift which can compound over time. These systems are similar to the Wii controllers but are more sensitive and have greater resolution and update rates. They can accurately measure the direction to the ground to within a degree. The popularity of inertial systems is rising amongst game developers, mainly because of the quick and easy set up resulting in a fast pipeline. A range of suits are now available from various manufacturers and base prices range from $1,000 to US$80,000. =Mechanical motion= Mechanical motion capture systems directly track body joint angles and are often referred to as exoskeleton motion capture systems, due to the way the sensors are attached to the body. A performer attaches the skeletal- like structure to their body and as they move so do the articulated mechanical parts, measuring the performer's relative motion. Mechanical motion capture systems are real-time, relatively low-cost, free-of-occlusion, and wireless (untethered) systems that have unlimited capture volume. Typically, they are rigid structures of jointed, straight metal or plastic rods linked together with potentiometers that articulate at the joints of the body. These suits tend to be in the $25,000 to $75,000 range plus an external absolute positioning system. Some suits provide limited force feedback or haptic input. =Magnetic systems= Magnetic systems calculate position and orientation by the relative magnetic flux of three orthogonal coils on both the transmitter and each receiver. The relative intensity of the voltage or current of the three coils allows these systems to calculate both range and orientation by meticulously mapping the tracking volume. The sensor output is 6DOF, which provides useful results obtained with two-thirds the number of markers required in optical systems; one on upper arm and one on lower arm for elbow position and angle. The markers are not occluded by nonmetallic objects but are susceptible to magnetic and electrical interference from metal objects in the environment, like rebar (steel reinforcing bars in concrete) or wiring, which affect the magnetic field, and electrical sources such as monitors, lights, cables and computers. The sensor response is nonlinear, especially toward edges of the capture area. The wiring from the sensors tends to preclude extreme performance movements. With magnetic systems, it is possible to monitor the results of a motion capture session in real time. The capture volumes for magnetic systems are dramatically smaller than they are for optical systems. With the magnetic systems, there is a distinction between alternating-current(AC) and direct-current(DC) systems: DC system uses square pulses, AC systems uses sine wave pulse. Related techniques thumb =Facial motion capture= Most traditional motion capture hardware vendors provide for some type of low resolution facial capture utilizing anywhere from 32 to 300 markers with either an active or passive marker system. All of these solutions are limited by the time it takes to apply the markers, calibrate the positions and process the data. Ultimately the technology also limits their resolution and raw output quality levels. High fidelity facial motion capture, also known as performance capture, is the next generation of fidelity and is utilized to record the more complex movements in a human face in order to capture higher degrees of emotion. Facial capture is currently arranging itself in several distinct camps, including traditional motion capture data, blend shaped based solutions, capturing the actual topology of an actor's face, and proprietary systems. The two main techniques are stationary systems with an array of cameras capturing the facial expressions from multiple angles and using software such as the stereo mesh solver from OpenCV to create a 3D surface mesh, or to use light arrays as well to calculate the surface normals from the variance in brightness as the light source, camera position or both are changed. These techniques tend to be only limited in feature resolution by the camera resolution, apparent object size and number of cameras. If the users face is 50 percent of the working area of the camera and a camera has megapixel resolution, then sub millimeter facial motions can be detected by comparing frames. Recent work is focusing on increasing the frame rates and doing optical flow to allow the motions to be retargeted to other computer generated faces, rather than just making a 3D Mesh of the actor and their expressions. =RF positioning= RF (radio frequency) positioning systems are becoming more viable as higher frequency RF devices allow greater precision than older RF technologies such as traditional radar. The speed of light is 30 centimeters per nanosecond (billionth of a second), so a 10 gigahertz (billion cycles per second) RF signal enables an accuracy of about 3 centimeters. By measuring amplitude to a quarter wavelength, it is possible to improve the resolution down to about 8 mm. To achieve the resolution of optical systems, frequencies of 50 gigahertz or higher are needed, which are almost as dependant on line of sight and as easy to block as optical systems. Multipath and reradiation of the signal are likely to cause additional problems, but these technologies will be ideal for tracking larger volumes with reasonable accuracy, since the required resolution at 100 meter distances is not likely to be as high. Many RF scientists believe that radio frequency will never produce the accuracy required for motion capture. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Tehcnology researchers said in 2015 that they had made a system that tracks motion by RF signals, called RF Tracking. =Non-traditional systems= An alternative approach was developed where the actor is given an unlimited walking area through the use of a rotating sphere, similar to a hamster ball, which contains internal sensors recording the angular movements, removing the need for external cameras and other equipment. Even though this technology could potentially lead to much lower costs for motion capture, the basic sphere is only capable of recording a single continuous direction. Additional sensors worn on the person would be needed to record anything more. Another alternative is using a 6DOF (Degrees of freedom) motion platform with an integrated omni-directional treadmill with high resolution optical motion capture to achieve the same effect. The captured person can walk in an unlimited area, negotiating different uneven terrains. Applications include medical rehabilitation for balance training, bio-mechanical research and virtual reality. =3D pose estimation= In 3D pose estimation, an actor's pose can be reconstructed from an image or depth map.Ye, Mao, et al. \\"Accurate 3d pose estimation from a single depth image.\\" 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision.

He had earlier served as Mexico's foreign secretary for two terms and was the director of a small law school in Mexico City for sixteen years. Early life Perdo Lascur√°in was born in 1858 in the Rancho la Romita (now Colonia Roma) in Mexico City. He was the son of Francisco Lascur√°in Icaza and Ana Paredes Cort√©s. His family was wealthy and very religious. His family was of Basque origin by maternal line, established in Mexico in the early nineteenth century. Early career Lascur√°in received a law degree in 1880 from the Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia (National School of Jurisprudence) in Mexico City. He was mayor of Mexico City in 1910 when Francisco I. Madero began a campaign against the re-election of Porfirio D√≠az. Lascur√°in was a supporter of Madero, and after Madero was elected president to replace D√≠az, Lascur√°in served twice as foreign secretary in Madero's cabinet (10 April 1912 to 4 December 1912 and 15 January 1913 to 19 February 1913). In between the two terms, he again became mayor of the Mexico City. As foreign secretary, he had to deal with the demands of U.S. Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson. Presidency On 19 February 1913, General Victoriano Huerta overthrew Madero. Lascur√°in was one of the people who convinced Madero to resign the presidency while he was being held prisoner in the National Palace and claimed that his life was in danger if he refused. Under the 1857 Constitution of Mexico, the vice-president, the attorney general, the foreign secretary, and the interior secretary stood in line to the presidency. As well as Madero, Huerta had ousted Vice-President Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez and Attorney General Adolfo Valles Baca. To give the coup d'√©tat some appearance of legality, he had Lascur√°in, as foreign secretary, assume the presidency, who would then appoint him as his interior secretary, making Huerta next in line to the presidency, and then resign. The presidency thus passed to Huerta. As a consequence, Lascur√°in was president for less than an hour; sources quote figures ranging from 15 to 56 minutes. To date, Lascur√°in's presidency is the shortest in history, even briefer than that of Venezuelan politician Diosdado Cabello in 2002. Huerta called a late-night special session of Congress, and under the guns of his troops, the legislators endorsed his assumption of power. A few days later, Huerta had Madero and Pino Su√°rez killed. The coup and the events surrounding it became known as La decena tr√°gica (\\"the tragic ten [days]\\"). Later life Huerta offered Lascur√°in a post in his cabinet, but Lascur√°in declined. He retired from politics and began practicing again as a lawyer. He was the director of the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a conservative law school, for 16 years and published extensively on commercial and civil law. Lascur√°in died on July 21, 1952 at the age of 96, the second oldest former Mexican president.

His early book, The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism (1947), was influential in calling evangelicals to differentiate themselves from separatist fundamentalism and claim a role in influencing the wider American culture. He was involved in the creation of numerous major evangelical organizations, including the National Association of Evangelicals, Fuller Theological Seminary, Evangelical Theological Society, Christianity Today magazine (of which he was the founding editor), and the Institute for Advanced Christian Studies. The Carl F. H. Henry Institute for Evangelical Engagement at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and the Carl F. H. Henry Center for Theological Understanding at Trinity International University seek to carry on his legacy. Early life Henry grew up in Long Island, New York as the son of German immigrants, Karl F. Heinrich and Johanna Vaethroeder (V√§thr√∂der). After his high school graduation in 1929 he began working in newspaper journalism. While not unacquainted with Christianity, his first experience indicating a personal God came as he worked at a weekly newspaper office, proofreading galleys with a middle-aged woman, Mildred Christy. When Henry used Christ's name as a swear word, Christy commented, \\"Carl, I'd rather you slap my face than take the name of my best Friend in vain.\\" In 1932, at the age of 19, he became editor of The Smithtown Times and later a stringer for The New York Times. The next year, after becoming a Christian, he decided to go to college to begin a life of Christian service. Frank E. Gaebelein, then headmaster of The Stony Brook School, gave him a catalogue to the evangelical liberal arts Wheaton College.. He enrolled in 1935, where he was greatly influenced by the philosophical teaching of Gordon Clark. While at Wheaton, Henry also taught typing and journalism. There he met Helga, a missionary kid, whom he married in August 1940. He received both bachelor's and master's degrees from Wheaton. He then earned a Doctor of Theology degree from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary. He also earned a PhD from Boston University in 1949. His wife Helga Bender Henry wrote a book in 1955 about the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles. In 1999 she published Cameroon on a Clear Day about her parents' work in that country.. Their son Paul B. Henry was a U.S. Congressman from Michigan from 1985 until his death in 1993. Career Henry was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1942 and taught at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1942 to 1947. Also in 1942, Henry took part in launching the National Association of Evangelicals, serving on its board for several years and being book editor of their magazine United Evangelical Action. His first book was . His second book, , is a critique that rejects modern liberalism and preserves a doctrinal focus on the Bible, but also rejects the rigidness and disengagement of Fundamentalists. The book firmly established Henry as one of the leading Evangelical scholars. The same year that Uneasy Conscience was published, Henry joined with Harold Ockenga, Harold Lindsell, Edward John Carnell, and radio evangelist Charles E. Fuller to help establish Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He served as acting dean in the seminary's first year and remained there as a professor until he left to establish Christianity Today magazine. In 1949, Henry was part of the meeting of evangelical scholars who discussed the need for an organization \\"to promote serious academic discussion,\\" and suggested the name adopted by the resulting organization: the Evangelical Theological Society. In 1956, Henry became the first editor-in-chief of the magazine Christianity Today, which was founded by evangelist Billy Graham to serve as a scholarly voice for evangelical Christianity and a challenge to the liberal Christian Century. He was the magazine's editor until 1968. Henry taught as a visiting professor or guest lecturer at colleges, universities, seminaries, and conferences across the United States and around the world, including in Japan, Singapore, India, Liberia, South Korea, Yugoslavia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and Romania. These institutions include the Asian Center for Theological Studies and Mission, Bethel University (Minnesota), Christian Theological Seminary, Columbia Bible College, Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary, Gordon Divinity School (which is now known as Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary), Hillsdale College, Hong Kong Baptist College (which is now called Hong Kong Baptist University), Latin American Theological Seminary, Soongsil University, Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary (now renamed as Palmer Theological Seminary), The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and Winona Lake Summer School of Theology. He also served as the chairman for international conferences and consultations, including the World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin in 1966. In 1978 he signed the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, which affirmed Biblical inerrancy. In the early 1980s Henry was a founding board member of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, with which he remained active until the mid-1990s. Henry's magnum opus was a six-volume work entitled God, Revelation, and Authority, completed in 1983. He concluded \\"that if we humans say anything authentic about God, we can do so only on the basis of divine self-revelation; all other God-talk is conjectural.\\" In his magnum opus he presented a version of Christian apologetics called presuppositional apologetics.

Pythian Knighthood: Its History and Literature, 2nd Ed, Revised and Enlarged. The Pettibone Manufacturing Company, Fraternity Publishers, Cincinnati, 1892. founded in Washington, D.C., on 19 February 1864. The Knights of Pythias is the first fraternal organization to receive a charter under an act of the United States Congress.Approved May 5, 1870 [16 Stat. at L. 98, chap. 80] It was founded by Justus H. Rathbone, who had been inspired by a play by the Irish poet John Banim about the legend of Damon and Pythias. This legend illustrates the ideals of loyalty, honor, and friendship that are the center of the order. The order has over 2,000 lodges in the United States and around the world, with a total membership of over 50,000 in 2003. The order is headquartered in Stoughton, Massachusetts. Some lodges meet in structures referred to as Pythian Castles.  Organization  The structure of the Knights of Pythias is three-tiered. The local units used to be called \\"Castles,\\" but over time came to be called \\"Subordinate Lodges.\\" State and provincial organizations are called \\"Grand Lodges\\" and the national structure is called the \\"Supreme Lodge\\" and meets in convention biennially. The officers of the Supreme Lodge include the sitting Past Supreme Chancellor, Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Prelate, Secretary, Treasurer, Master at Arms, Inner Guard and Outer Guard. The order's auxiliaries are the Pythian Sisters, and two youth organizations: the Pythian Sunshine Girls and the Junior Order of Princes of Syracuse for boys. = Membership = Membership has historically been open to males in good health who believe in a Supreme Being. Maimed individuals were not admitted until 1875. Members are accepted by blackball ballot. A member must be at least 18 years of age, and must take the following oath: By the end of the so-called \\"Golden Age of Fraternalism\\" in the early 1920s, the order had nearly a million members. By 1979, however, this number had declined to fewer than 200,000. = Rank structure = The ranks of Pythian Knighthood in a subordinate lodge (or \\"Castle\\") are: #Page #Esquire #Knight In 1877, the order adopted an optional rank, called the Endowment Rank, which provided fraternal insurance benefits. In 1930, this department split from the Knights of Pythias and became a mutual life insurance company, later known as the American United Insurance Company. The Knights of Pythias also has a side degree, the Dramatic Order of the Knights of Khorassan, which itself has a female auxiliary, the Nomads of Avrudaka. Finally, members who obtained the rank of Knight were eligible to join the now-defunct Uniform Rank, which participated in parades and other processions. = Sword = Early in the group's history, when a man was inducted into the Knights of Pythias, he received a ceremonial sword.Glickman, Lawrence B. Consumer Society in American History: A Reader. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1999, p. 223. Such a sword might be given to a Pythian by family members, business associates, or others as a token of esteem. In recent decades, rather than require each member to own a sword, the local chapter maintains a collection of swords for use by its members. Long, narrow swords are generally used in public during parades and drills, while short swords are used in displays. Markings on swords varied widely. Most swords were inscribed with the acronym \\"FCB\\", which stands for the Pythian motto (\\"Friendship, Charity, Benevolence\\"). Images on swords were also somewhat common, and included: A man, woman, and child (symbolic of Pythias saying good-bye to his family); a man looking out of a building, with a group of people below (symbolic of Damon's pending execution); a man between some pillars, pulling them down (similar to Samson destroying his enemy's temple); or various types of weapons (swords, axes, hammers, etc.). A full Knight of the Pythian order often inscribed his sword with the image of a knight's helmet with a lion on the crest. Many also carried the image of a sprig of myrtle (the Pythian symbol of love) or a falcon (the Pythian symbol of vigilance). Swords owned by a member of the Uniformed Rank might be inscribed with the acronym \\"UR,\\" a dove, or a lily. = Philanthropy = The order provides for \\"worthy Pythians in distress\\" and has given aid to victims of national or sectional disasters. It runs camps for underprivileged youth and homes for aged members. It has sponsored scholarship funds, blood drives, highway safety programs, and the Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation.  Other Pythian organizations  = Knights of Pythias of North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa = After a black lodge was denied a charter by the Knights of Pythias' Supreme Lodge meeting in Richmond, Virginia on March 8, 1869, a number of black Americans who had been initiated into the order formed their own Pythian group, the Knights of Pythias of North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. By 1897, the KPNSAEAA had 40,000 members, with Grand Lodges in 20 states and other lodges in the West Indies and Central America. It distributed $60,000 worth of benefits annually and had a woman's auxiliary and uniformed rank.  Canada  The Grand Lodge of Ontario was instituted on April 8, 1872. Rowena L. Rooks composed \\"K of P grand march [for piano],\\" which was dedicated to Collin H. Rose, Grand Chancellor, and the officers and representatives of the Grand Lodge K of P of Ontario, Canada. The march sheet music, which was published in London, Ontario, by C. F. Colwell, circa 1876, was illustrated with the Knights of Pythias emblem and Latin motto, Amico Fidus ad Aras, or in English, \\"True friends are a refuge.\\".AMICUS No. 5379212 Library and Archives Canada, Sheet music from our past. = Improved Order, Knights of Pythias = In 1892, the Supreme Lodge ruled that the work of the order would only be conducted in English. This upset some members who were accustomed to using German. After this ruling was reiterated at the Supreme Lodges of 1894 and 1895, a number of German-speaking Pythians split off and formed the Improved Order, Knights of Pythias at a convention in Indianapolis in June 1895. The new order was reportedly not very popular, and a movement toward reconciliation occurred a few years later.

She is a foe of the X-Men, especially Wolverine. Her father Lord Dark Wind created the adamantium-bonding process that was forced on Wolverine by Weapon X. A self-styled warrior, Lady Deathstrike hired the villain Spiral‚Äôs \\"body shoppe\\" to bond adamantium to her own skeleton in addition to other cyber-genetic enhancements. She has since worked as a mercenary and assassin and feels a need to prove herself by killing Wolverine. Lady Deathstrike is also the sister of Lord Deathstrike. She, along with former X-Men members Mystique, Sabretooth, Domino, Warpath, and Old Man Logan formed a team called Weapon X-Men named after the facility they escaped but later changed to Weapon X-Force after Logan and Warpath left with Omega Red. A mutant version of Lady Deathstrike, played by Kelly Hu and without any of Deathstrike's backstory, appeared as a brainwashed henchman of William Stryker in the 2003 film X2. She also re-appeared in X-Men: The Official Game, where she was revealed to be Silver Samurai's apprentice. In 2009, Lady Deathstrike was ranked as IGN's 78th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.Lady Deathstrike is number 78 IGN. Retrieved 10-05-09. Publication history She first appeared as Yuriko Oyama in Daredevil #197 and later as Lady Deathstrike in Alpha Flight #33. Yuriko Oyama was created by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Larry Hama. Writers Bill Mantlo and Chris Claremont added defining characteristics such as her cyborg abilities, while artist Barry Windsor-Smith designed her cyborg appearance. Fictional character biography Yuriko's second costume Yuriko Oyama (Â§ßÂ±± „ÇÜ„Çä„Åì Oyama Yuriko) was born in Osaka, Japan. Her father was Lord Dark Wind (Kenji Oyama), a Japanese crime lord and criminal scientist who created the process by which adamantium can be bonded to bone. Kenji was a former Japanese kamikaze pilot during World War II. His face was horribly scarred in a failed suicide attack on an American battleship. Feeling ashamed by his failure decades earlier, he scarred the faces of Yuriko and her two brothers in a ritual design. Her two brothers would later die while in their father's service. Yuriko teamed up with Daredevil to free her lover, Kiro, from her father's servitude, and to take vengeance on her father for her scarring and the death of her two brothers. She guided Daredevil to Lord Dark Wind's private island in search of Bullseye.Daredevil #197-199 When Yuriko slew Lord Dark Wind, the devoted Kiro chose suicide to honor his master. Distraught, Yuriko belatedly embraced her father's ideals and sought to track down whoever dishonored him and restore Japan's honor. She adopted a costumed identity, as a samurai warrior. She attempted to find Bullseye with an adamantium tracking device, intending to get revenge on him for betraying her father and retrieve the adamantium in his bones for study. Instead, the device led to Wolverine, whose skeleton had also been bonded with adamantium. Deathstrike sought to kill him to right the wrong of the theft of her father's theories and to restore her family's honor; however, she and her followers were defeated by Wolverine and Vindicator of Alpha Flight.Alpha Flight #33-34 She then went to the Mojoverse and sought Spiral's \\"body shoppe\\" where she received extensive cybernetic enhancements including adamantium bones and talons. As a cyborg, she became a professional criminal, and joined forces with former Hellfire Club mercenaries-turned-cyborgs Cole, Macon, and Reese. The four cyborgs stalked Wolverine and Katie Power in New York.Uncanny X-Men #205 Lady Deathstrike -- along with Cole, Macon, and Reese -- joined the team of criminal cyborgs called the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce. Together, the Reavers captured and crucified Wolverine.Uncanny X-Men #251 Lady Deathstrike was accidentally teleported along with Wolverine and Puck to 1937 Spain. There, she joined forces with a Luftwaffe unit, and battled Wolverine. Her right arm was destroyed by a tank, and when she returned to the present she was given a new right arm.Wolverine Vol.2 #35-38 The Reavers gang was broken up by Trevor Fitzroy's Sentinels and most of them were destroyed, though Deathstrike herself survived.Uncanny X-Men #281 She later battled Wolverine and Sabretooth in Times Square.Wolverine Vol. 2 #45-46 At times she has resigned her quest to kill Logan and has even worked with the X-Men cooperatively toward a common goal,X-Men Annual 2000 such as the defeat of Stryfe. In an encounter with Logan shortly after Magneto removed the adamantium from his skeleton, Lady Deathstrike again encounters Puck and Vindicator. The fight with Wolverine destroys much of Vindicator's house and ends when Wolverine reveals his bone claws. As Logan no longer possessed the adamantium stolen from her father, she concluded there was no honor to be gained by killing him. She leaves the premises peacefully.Wolverine Vol. 2 #77-78 However, she still remains a mercenary and an assassin. Despite all this, Yuriko is set apart from many of the X-Men's foes in that she adheres to an honor code, despite being emotionally disturbed. When Captain America unexpectedly appears in Japan after a year spent in another dimension, he manages to find Lady Deathstrike working with terrorists. Their goals were to drive American influence out of Japan, by any means possible, including mass murder. Captain America defeats her before any innocent lives are lost. Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as an ally of William Stryker.God Loves, Man Kills II She displays a new ability to access the Internet via her cybernetics but this led to her being co-opted and controlled by Mount Haven's computer systems. Lady Deathstrike was responsible for mutilating and nearly killing Sunfire, whose legs she severed in battle. Following her confrontation with Rogue and Sunfire, Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as a member of one of the United States government's Army of Thunderbolts in the super hero Civil War, temporarily released from prison in order to go after the Secret Avengers, who resisted the Superhuman Registration Act. She fights alongside other criminals such as Venom, Jester, Bullseye, Jack O'Lantern, Taskmaster, and Songbird.Civil War #5 She participates in the final battle of the Civil War in Times Square, New York City, before being sent to the Negative Zone Prison.Civil War #7 Lady Deathstrike returns during the Messiah Complex story to play an important role in the series, facing off against X-23.IGN: Marvel in December 2007 This was confirmed by IGN Comics, who, in their editorial analysis \\"13 Days of Messiah Complex,\\" revealed that Deathstrike would be leading a new team of Reavers throughout the event.IGN: X-Men: Messiah Complex - Day Thirteen As reported, Lady Deathstrike appears alongside the Reavers, now made up of nameless Purifiers with armor and weapons instead of any former members.New X-Men vol. 2 #44 Having allied with the Purifiers to destroy mutant-kind, Lady Deathstrike leads the new Reaver team against the New X-Men, gravely wounding Hellion in the process. Her armor was destroyed by X-23 and Rockslide. She appears again in pursuit of Cable and the mutant newbornX-Factor vol. 3 #26New X-Men vol. 2 #45 where she battled X-Force and X-23 again and X-23 nearly kills her. Lady Deathstrike is apparently saved from death due to the actions of Spiral, as she is later seen under repair in Spiral's Body Shoppe when Madelyne Pryor approaches Spiral with an invitation of membership in her Sisterhood of Mutants. Despite not originally being approached to join the Sisterhood, Lady Deathstrike accepts Pryor's offer nonetheless.Uncanny X-Men #504 It appears that while Spiral repaired Lady Deathstrike's body, she also gave her a more submissive personality, as during missions with the Sisterhood, she continually does whatever she is told, while referring to Spiral as \\"Mistress\\".Uncanny X-Men #508 After the Sisterhood resurrects Psylocke, they finally make their move on the X-Men, with Lady Deathstrike being tasked to take down Wolverine, by piercing his lungs.Uncanny X-Men #509 Lady Deathstrike kept Wolverine busy while the Sisterhood raided his room for one of his most treasured possessions: a lock of Jean Grey's hair.Uncanny X-Men #510 Lady Deathstrike later reappeared with the Reavers. Still driven for revenge against Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike worked with the Reavers to suicide-bomb Utopia. However, when X-Force intervened, Lady Deathstrike escaped her body via Internet.Uncanny X-Force #5.1 During the Ends of the Earth storyline, Lady Deathstrike was seen in one of Doctor Octopus's facilities in Australia. When Kangaroo II enters this facility, Lady Deathstrike ambushes and kills him in one swift swipe from her claw.The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1 Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers are later seen in the Core, an underground city populated by robots. She does battle with Captain Britain after the Secret Avengers arrive in the city in search of Ant-Man.Secret Avengers #24 Lady Deathstrike's consciousness was later uploaded in the body of Ana Cortes, establishing a symbiotic relationship with Ana's consciousness. Cortes was a teenage Latin female that has returned to Bogota, Colombia from boarding school after the death of her father to inherit her deceased father's kingdom. She then traveled to the Jean Grey Academy alongside her friend Reiko to find Karima Shapandar and retrieve the Omega Sentinel technology. Deathstrike and her team see her jogging with Monet, and attempt to ambush them. During the confrontation, Karmina is shot, and Monet manages to protect her temporarily, until Monet gets caught off guard. Before Deathstrike could finish her attack, Karmina shoots, and injures Lady Deathstrike causing her to retreat to regroup and get more intel. She then learns of Arkea, and has hired Typhoid Mary to help her achieve this goal.X-Men #7 Deathstrike and Typhoid Mary argue with John Sublime about Arkea and they manage to get information out of him that there was more than one piece of Arkea that was alive, as the one they had was dead and not viable. Mary knocks Sublime unconscious and she and Deathstrike manages to escape before Psylocke comes to check on Sublime. Deathstrike and Mary makes their way to Troms, Norway, where they find Amora, who has been exiled by Thor and stripped of her powers.X-Men Vol. 4 #8 (December 18, 2013) Deathstrike promises Amora that she will make her powerful once again. Amora brings Deathstrike and Mary to where the Arkea meteorite is located when Mary wants to renegotiate the terms of her hire and want to become partners. Deathstrike says it was not just a partnership, but the formation of a new Sisterhood of Mutants. With the live Arkea taking possession of Reiko, she empowers Deathstrike, Mary and Amora. Deathstrike and her Sisterhood manage to escape the X-Men and Monet with Arkea activating several sentinels under the ocean.X-Men Vol. 4 #9 (January 22, 2014) The mental conflict between Ana and Yuriko made Lady Deathstrike increasingly unstable. Ana Cortes grew to regret her life as a supervillain and did not like the direction Arkea was leading the Sisterhood. She notified the X-Men of the Sisterhood's location, after she became increasingly concerned about Arkea's bold moves such as having Amora resurrect Selene Gallio, the Black Queen.X-Men Vol. 4 #11 (February 2014) Ana flipped out and tried to get Typhoid Mary to kill her, but Mary refused. Upon Arkea asking Ana to come be a part of the procedure to resurrect Madelyne Pryor, Ana killed herself to prevent Arkea from using her further. Ana's death didn't stop Arkea's plans. Arkea simply removed Yuriko's consciousness from Ana's body and placed it in Reiko's body along with Arkea's own. Ana's body was spliced with Jean Grey's DNA in order to enable it to host Madelyne Pryor's consciousness. Amora then completed the resurrection of Madelyne Pryor. After the X-Men's confrontation with the Sisterhood, Karima leaves the X-Men to team up with Sabra and investigate the Cortes crime family. Though Arkea was destroyed by the X-Men, Lady Deathstrike's consciousness remained intact inside Reiko's body.X-Men Vol. 4 #12 (March 2014) The Reavers later arrived in Killhorn Falls with Lady Deathstrike and attempt to hunt down Logan for good.Old Man Logan Vol. 2 #5 As the Reavers attacked Killhorn Falls, Old Man Logan single-handedly killed all the Reavers soldiers and confronted Lady Deathstrike before saving Maureen. After being wounded multiple times, Logan manages to defeat Lady Deathstrike, as she started limping away when Logan blacked out. Thinking that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan decided to set-off to find Lady Deathstrike.Old Man Logan Vol. 2 #6 While in hiding during the \\"Weapons of Mutant Destruction\\" storyline, Lady Deathstrike is discovered and captured by the new Weapon X. While held in their captivity, she is experimented on.Weapon X Vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics. This experiment led to her nanotechnology being used in their creation of Weapon H.Totally Awesome Hulk #21. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Hunt for Wolverine\\" storyline, Lady Deathstrike is seen at Chester's Bar where she tells Daken and Sabretooth about what the Reavers discovered when they went after Wolverine and that he has recently been sighted alive. The three of them go on the trail of Wolverine where they arrive in Maybelle, Arizona.Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer #1. Marvel Comics. Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike continue searching Maybelle for Wolverine when they are attacked by zombies made from those at a birthday party. One of them bites Sabretooth as Lady Deathstrike gets him away from the zombies. Both of them wonder where the zombies came from. As they get to their car, it suddenly explodes. Sabretooth starts running and finds that his zombie bite is not healing. Sabretooth comes across more zombies as he starts killing them with Lady Deathstrike not far behind him. Both of them take refuge in a garage.Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer #2. Marvel Comics. When Daken catches up to them, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth are informed of a glowing green device in the power station that has to do with the zombies and they must fight their way past the zombies to destroy it before Maybelle is burned to the ground. While fighting zombies and Soteira Killteam Nine, Lady Deathstrike discovers that one of the soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine is a zombified version of her father who stabs Lady Deathstrike.Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer #3. Marvel Comics. Lady Deathstrike recovers and continues her fight with her father until Lord Dark Wind cuts off her left hand. Using her right hand, Lady Deathstrike stabs her father in the neck. Then she does the same thing to a zombified Graydon Creed. After telling Sabretooth that the adamantium they tracked was her father's adamantium and learning that Daken is dead, Lady Deathstrike accompanies Sabretooth to where the glowing device is and destroy the device before Maybelle can be burned to the ground. The next day, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike carjack someone outside a diner as Sabretooth suggests to Lady Deathstrike to have her Reaver friends get her a new hand. Lady Deathstrike tells Sabretooth to shut up and drive.Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer #4. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Lady Deathstrike was transformed into a cyborg by Spiral and the \\"Body Shop\\" using alien technology of Mojo's dimension,The Uncanny X-Men vol. 1 #205 with later modifications by Donald Pierce. She has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Deathstrike's skeleton has been artificially laced with molecules of adamantium, rendering her skeletal structure physically unbreakable. Later, in the pages of Uncanny X-Men, it was shown that Spiral used magic to infuse the metal into Deathstrike's body. Deathstrike's fingers have been replaced by five long adamantium claws replacing each finger of each hand. Aside from being as indestructible as her skeleton, these talons are capable of slicing through virtually any substance, other than adamantium itself and Captain America's shield. She is capable of telescoping these claws to twice their usual length. She also had the ability to interface with computers, allowing direct data access to her brain's memory centers. Although her normal form is visibly that of a cyborg, she uses disguises when necessary. She is a trained assassin and is skilled in a variety of Asian martial arts. Lady Deathstrike is especially skilled with swords, and while she prefers stealth and subtlety in her killings, she is emotionally disturbed and this interferes with her effectiveness. Deathstrike suffers from mental instability; she is an unbalanced fanatic, a condition worsened by her transformation into a cyborg. Before she received her cybernetic enhancements, Deathstrike used a special five-foot steel katana that was electromagnetically tempered and sheathed in energy.Alpha Flight vol. 1 #34 The energy sheath enabled the sword to cut through most substances and made it as resilient as adamantium. She has also used shuriken, nunchakus, a high-powered long-range blaster which fires armor- piercing explosive bullets, and wrist-bands containing adamantium detectors. She also wore a modified traditional Japanese battle-armor which could withstand even superhuman blows. Her items were constructed by weapon-smiths of Lord Dark Wind's organization. Deathstrike later received an upgrade that provides her with a kind of \\"cybernetic healing factor\\" that functions similarly, although not as efficiently, to Wolverine's.Wolverine vol. 2 #114 Lady Deathstrike is fluent in both English and Japanese, and an accomplished pilot of various air and sea-craft. The left side of Yuriko Oyama's face was scarred in a ritual design by her father; this was apparently surgically repaired when she became a cyborg. Lady Deathstrike's original body was destroyed. She became a digital consciousness. She was downloaded into Ana Cortes, who became her host and the new Lady Deathstrike until Ana killed herself.X-Men Vol. 4 #7 (November 2013) Yuriko's mind was placed into the body of her friend Reiko, who currently hosts her. Other versions Cover to Ultimate X-Men #60. Art by Stuart Immonen. =Amalgam= In the Amalgam Comics universe, Lady Deathstrike was merged with Talia al Ghul of DC Comics and became Lady Talia. She was the lover of Logan Wayne aka Dark Claw, but swore revenge when Dark Claw murdered her father, Ra's Al-Pocalypse, to prevent him from unleashing a deadly chemical on the world. She became cybernetically enhanced and ambushed Dark Claw in his cave after tying up his sidekick, the Sparrow. In a choice between love and revenge, she nearly murders Logan, but his healing factor allows him to recover from the injury.Dark Claw Adventures =Ultimate Marvel= Lady Deathstrike has also appeared in Ultimate Marvel's Ultimate X-Men line. There, her connection lies mainly with Storm, instead of Wolverine as in the original storyline. As Yuriko (or 'Yuri'), she taught Storm how to hotwire vehicles and be a car thief. The two later had a falling out, and Yuri ended up being run over by a truck. Yuri survived, but needed to use a wheelchair. There, Dr. Cornelius of Weapon X offered to have her shattered body rebuilt with adamantium, extendable claws, and an accelerated healing factor based on Wolverine's DNA, which would allow her to have her revenge against Storm, though if she wanted to kill Storm she would have to kill Storm's friend Wolverine as well. Yuri agreed, and underwent the modifications. She later went after Storm and Wolverine, but was defeated, and later imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D..Ultimate X-Men #61 While imprisoned at the Triskelion, she encountered the X-Men Dazzler and Angel (who were out searching for their friends, elsewhere in the base). After Dazzler taunted Yuri, saying how Storm had mentioned her to them, the power went out, allowing Yuri to escape her cell and stab Dazzler through the stomach. Before she could do anything else, the mutant Longshot (another prisoner at the Triskelion) snapped Yuri's neck.Ultimate X-Men #65 Whether or not this attack killed her is unknown. She has previously survived being struck by lightning and smashed by a falling tree. Dazzler survived Yuri's attack, remaining in a coma for a few weeks before awakening. In other media =Television= X-Men animated series. * Lady Deathstrike appeared in the two-part X-Men episode \\"Out of the Past\\" voiced by Jane Luk. She had a romantic relationship and past with Wolverine. Yuriko Oyama joined the Reavers and became a cyborg in order to avenge the death of her father Professor Oyama who she believed was killed during Logan's rampage at the Weapon X headquarters. =Film= Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike in X2 (2003). * Lady Deathstrike was portrayed by the actress Kelly Hu in the film X2 released in 2003. This version of Lady Deathstrike (never referred to by name) is not portrayed as a cyborg (although the DVD booklet refers to her as being cybernetically enhanced), but as a brainwashed mutant with regenerative abilities similar to those of Wolverine. This version of Lady Deathstrike also demonstrates superhuman strength in the film, throwing Wolverine across a room with enough force to shatter a concrete wall. She wears a grey suit in the film for a period before wearing a leather suit during the remainder of the film. In the film, she is William Stryker's brainwashed mutant assistant. She was also involved in the same government program as Wolverine called Weapon X giving her adamantium claws that extend from the tip of her fingernails, instead of from her knuckles, giving her five claws on each hand rather than Wolverine's three. On Stryker's orders, Deathstrike ambushed and successfully captured both Cyclops and Professor Xavier. Although she is portrayed as a supervillainness in the film, her actual orientation and origin are unclear because she is under the effects of mind control. After a fight with Wolverine that takes place in the laboratory where Wolverine underwent his own transformation, Wolverine disabled Deathstrike with a fluid adamantium injection, presumably killing her. * Lady Deathstrike makes an appearance as an antagonist in the \\"Hulk vs. Wolverine\\" portion of the animated film Hulk Vs, voiced by Janyse Jaud. She is still a cyborg, but is portrayed as an agent of Weapon X, alongside Sabretooth, Omega Red, and Deadpool, collectively known as Team X. They are sent by Prof. Thornton to capture former brain-washed member Wolverine and the Hulk, but once he learns of their true agenda, Logan is able to use Deathstrike's desire to kill him to provoke her into attacking him so that she accidentally stabs Sabretooth behind him, allowing him to escape and rescue the Hulk. In the final battle in the Weapon X facility, the Hulk tears off Lady Deathstrike's cybernetic arms, and she is left in the facility when it implodes. =Video games= * Lady Deathstrike appears as a playable character in X-Men: Next Dimension, voiced by Gwendoline Yeo. * Gwendoline Yeo reprises her role of Lady Deathstrike was also the final boss in the game X2: Wolverine's Revenge. She also mentions her bionic implants and her father (who is possibly the Professor in the game). Lady Deathstrike fights Wolverine on top of the Xenon Building where it was revealed that she was behind the androids of the pilot (voiced by Mayim Bialik), the Army G.I. (voiced by Don Morrow), and May Deuce (also voiced by Mayim Bialik) who she used in a plot to kill Wolverine. She also revealed that she paid Sabretooth to cause him pain. Wolverine defeats Lady Deathstrike and reaches a helicopter land platform where she follows him. Wolverine throws Lady Deathstrike off the roof. Sabretooth finds Lady Deathstrike. He takes a vial from her and drinks it (most likely the cure for the Shiva Strain Virus) and carries her body away. * Lady Deathstrike appears as a \\"boss\\" in the video game X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, voiced by Kim Mai Guest. She is working with Apocalypse for free when she heard that Wolverine would be partaking in the fight against him. The X-Men and the Brotherhood encounter her on the Genoshan Seawall where the living quarters there have been made into prisons for the Genoshan mutants. If Wolverine is on your team or your active character is an X-Man, you must fight her. If your active character is a Brotherhood member, you have the option of paying her off to leave you alone. Outside of that, she has special dialogue with Wolverine. * Lady Deathstrike appears as an enemy in X-Men: The Official Game (which fills the gap between X2: X-Men United and X-Men: The Last Stand), voiced by Vyvan Pham. In this video game, it is revealed that Lady Deathstrike had survived the overdose (though the console version offers no explanation for her survival, or how she managed to get the hardened adamantium out of her body, the DS version explains that she was recovered by the Silver Samurai and most of her organs were replaced with artificial ones making her a cyborg like her comic counterpart), and proceeds to battle Wolverine two times in the game. It is also revealed that Lady Deathstrike was an agent of HYDRA and a student of Silver Samurai. She was sent to spy on Stryker, but instead was brainwashed into becoming his bodyguard. Lady Deathstrike's final battle with Wolverine ends when she is crushed under a pile of rubble. * Lady Deathstrike appears as a boss in Wolverine: Adamantium Rage. * Lady Deathstrike appears in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2, voiced by Jocelyn Blue. She is among the multiple villains who are being controlled by the Government's Control Nanites to fight the Anti-Registration Heroes. She is also a mini-boss twice in New York when the player chooses to be on the Anti-Registration side: the first is when she is knocked out by Thing, the second is when the heroes on the Anti- Registration side defeat her. She later assists the Thunderbolts and the Pro- Registration side in fighting the Anti-Registration side at Geffen-Meyer Chemicals. During the fight, Lady Deathstrike (alongside Bullseye, Green Goblin, and Venom III) end up attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and setting up bombs when their Control Nanites lose control. In the Prison 42 cutscene, Lady Deathstrike is shown with the other nanite-controlled supervillains attacking both sides. When she is about to deliver the finishing blow on Iron Man, Captain America saves him. In the PSP, PS2 and Wii versions, she fights the heroes in Prison 42 alongside Bullseye. * Lady Deathstrike appears in Strider Hiryu's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. * Lady Deathstrike appears in Marvel Heroes, voiced by Minae Noji.

The Dajti belongs to the Skanderbeg range. In winter, the mountain is often covered with snow, and it is a popular retreat to the local population of Tirana that rarely sees snow falls. Its slopes have forests of pines, oak and beech, while its interior contains canyons, waterfalls, caves, a lake, and an ancient castle. Protected area Dajti National Park was declared a national park in 1966, and has an expanded area of about 29,384 hectares since 2006. The area is under shared jurisdiction between Albanian Agency of Protected Areas (AKZM) and Tirana Municipality Parks and Recreation Agency (APR). In 2019, the new Dajti Mt National Park tourist information centre was opened located near the TV and Radio towers along SH47 road in Fushe Dajt.http://ata.gov.al/2019/03/25/inaugurohet-qendra- e-re-e-vizitoreve-ne-parkun-kombetar-te-dajtit/ Dajti Ekspres Cable Car upper station The mountain can be reached through a narrow asphalted mountain road onto an area known as Fusha e Dajtit. This was the location of a summer camp but now is the site of many restaurants and radio and TV transmitters. From this small area there is an excellent view of Tirana and its plain. This is the reason this place has been named as the Balcony of Tirana. From June 2005, hikers and visitors of the mountain can use an Austrian built gondola lift from the eastern outskirts of Tirana to Fusha e Dajtit (Plain of Dajti) at 1050 meters altitude. On the summit of Mount Dajti there exist several radio and TV transmitters. Lately, traces of prehistoric settlements and fortifications from later periods have been discovered in the area. Environmental issues Priska Mt forest fires in 2019 A serious environmental problem on the mountain is, how to deal with garbage. This is partially caused by restaurants and hotels that leave rubbish everywhere since there are few garbage bins in the region. Another major problem on the mountain is deforestation. In the summer of 2012, 10 ha of forests were burned at the Priska summit.http://gazeta-shqip.com/lajme/2012/08/16/zjarret-ne-dajt/ Forest fires are happening yearly while those responsible are not being convicted. Responsibilities lie with the Ministry of the Environment, Municipality of Tirana, foresters (rangers) and the people who live in the area. Water pollution of the lake and air pollution caused by cars crossing the mountain roads are also problematic.

It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but can also form an ulcer. Onset is often over months. Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread to distant areas than basal cell cancer. When confined to the outermost layer of the skin, a precancerous or in situ form of cSCC is known as Bowen's disease. The greatest risk factor is high total exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Other risks include prior scars, chronic wounds, actinic keratosis, lighter skin, Bowen's disease, arsenic exposure, radiation therapy, poor immune system function, previous basal cell carcinoma, and HPV infection. Risk from UV radiation is related to total exposure, rather than early exposure. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. Risk is also elevated in certain genetic skin disorders, such as xeroderma pigmentosum and certain forms of epidermolysis bullosa. It begins from squamous cells found within the skin. Diagnosis is often based on skin examination and confirmed by tissue biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing squamous-cell skin cancer. Treatment is typically by surgical removal. This can be by simple excision if the cancer is small otherwise Mohs surgery is generally recommended. Other options may include application of cold and radiation therapy. In the cases in which distant spread has occurred chemotherapy or biologic therapy may be used. As of 2015, about 2.2 million people have cSCC at any given time. It makes up about 20% of all skin cancer cases. About 12% of males and 7% of females in the United States developed cSCC at some point in time. While prognosis is usually good, if distant spread occurs five-year survival is ~34%. In 2015 it resulted in about 51,900 deaths globally. The usual age at diagnosis is around 66. Following the successful treatment of one case of cSCC people are at high risk of developing further cases. Signs and symptoms Squamous cell carcinoma SCC of the skin begins as a small nodule and as it enlarges the center becomes necrotic and sloughs and the nodule turns into an ulcer. *The lesion caused by SCC is often asymptomatic *Ulcer or reddish skin plaque that is slow growing *Intermittent bleeding from the tumor, especially on the lip *The clinical appearance is highly variable *Usually the tumor presents as an ulcerated lesion with hard, raised edges *The tumor may be in the form of a hard plaque or a papule, often with an opalescent quality, with tiny blood vessels *The tumor can lie below the level of the surrounding skin, and eventually ulcerates and invades the underlying tissue *The tumor commonly presents on sun-exposed areas (e.g. back of the hand, scalp, lip, and superior surface of pinna) *On the lip, the tumor forms a small ulcer, which fails to heal and bleeds intermittently *Evidence of chronic skin photodamage, such as multiple actinic keratoses (solar keratoses) *The tumor grows relatively slowly =Spread= *Unlike basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has a higher risk of metastasis. *Risk of metastasis is higher in SCC arising in scars, on the lower lips or mucosa, and occurring in immunosuppressed patients.

File:Squamous_Cell_Carcinoma,_Right_Upper_Cheek.pngthumbSquamous Cell Carcinoma, Right Upper Cheek; Lesion outlined in blue marker with a dashed line prior to biopsy Causes Squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most common cancer of the skin (after basal-cell carcinoma but more common than melanoma). It usually occurs in areas exposed to the sun. Sunlight exposure and immunosuppression are risk factors for SCC of the skin, with chronic sun exposure being the strongest environmental risk factor. There is a risk of metastasis starting more than 10 years after diagnosable appearance of squamous cell carcinoma, but the risk is low, though much higher than with basal-cell carcinoma. Squamous cell cancers of the lip and ears have high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis. In a recent study, it has also been shown that the deletion or severe down-regulation of a gene titled Tpl2 (tumor progression locus 2) may be involved in the progression of normal keratinocytes into becoming squamous cell carcinoma. SCCs represent about 20% of the non-melanoma skin cancers, but due to their more obvious nature and growth rates, they represent 90% of all head and neck cancers that are initially presented. The vast majority of SCCs are those of the skin, and are often the result of ultraviolet exposure. SCCs usually occur on portions of the body commonly exposed to the Sun; the face, ears, neck, hands, or arm. The main symptom is a growing bump that may have a rough, scaly surface and flat reddish patches. Unlike basal-cell carcinomas, SCCs carry a higher risk of metastasis, and may spread to the regional lymph nodes, Erythroplasia of Queyrat (SCC in situ of the glans or prepuce in males, M or the vulvae in females.) may be induced by human papilloma virus.J Invest Dermatol 2000 Sep;115(3):396‚Äì401 It is reported to occur in the corneoscleral limbus.Syed Imtiaz Ali Shah, Saeed Ahmed Sangi, Seraj Ahmed Abbasi: Bowen‚Äôs Disease: Pak J Ophthalmol 1998 Vol. 14, No. 1, pp. 37‚Äì38. Erythroplasia of Queyrat may also occur on the anal mucosa or the oral mucosa. Some sources state that this condition is synonymous with Bowen's disease, however generally speaking Bowen's disease refers to carcinoma in situ of any location on the skin such as the lower leg. =Immunosuppression= People who have received solid organ transplants are at a significantly increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma due to the use of chronic immunosuppressive medication. While the risk of developing all skin cancers increases with these medications, this effect is particularly severe for SCC, with hazard ratios as high as 250 being reported, versus 40 for basal cell carcinoma. The incidence of SCC development increases with time posttransplant. Heart and lung transplant recipients are at the highest risk of developing SCC due to more intensive immunosuppressive medications used. Squamous cell cancers of the skin in individuals on immunotherapy or suffering from lymphoproliferative disorders (i.e. leukemia) tend to be much more aggressive, regardless of their location. The risk of SCC, and non-melanoma skin cancers generally, varies with the immunosuppressive drug regimen chosen. The risk is greatest with calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and least with mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus. The antimetabolites azathioprine and mycophenolic acid have an intermediate risk profile. Diagnosis Diagnosis is confirmed via biopsy of the tissue(s) suspected to be affected by SCC. For the skin, look under skin biopsy. The pathological appearance of a squamous cell cancer varies with the depth of the biopsy. For that reason, a biopsy including the subcutaneous tissue and basilar epithelium, to the surface is necessary for correct diagnosis. The performance of a shave biopsy (see skin biopsy) might not acquire enough information for a diagnosis. An inadequate biopsy might be read as actinic keratosis with follicular involvement. A deeper biopsy down to the dermis or subcutaneous tissue might reveal the true cancer. An excision biopsy is ideal, but not practical in most cases. An incisional or punch biopsy is preferred. A shave biopsy is least ideal, especially if only the superficial portion is acquired. =Characteristics= Histopathologically, the epidermis in SCC in situ (Bowen‚Äôs disease) will show hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. There will also be marked acanthosis with elongation and thickening of the rete ridges. These changes will overly keratinocytic cells which are often highly atypical and may in fact have a more unusual appearance than invasive SCC. The atypia spans the full thickness of the epidermis, with the keratinocytes demonstrating intense mitotic activity, pleomorphism, and greatly enlarged nuclei. They will also show a loss of maturity and polarity, giving the epidermis a disordered or ‚Äúwindblown‚Äù appearance. Two types of multinucleated cells may be seen: the first will present as a multinucleated giant cell, and the second will appear as a dyskeratotic cell engulfed in the cytoplasm of a keratinocyte. Occasionally, cells of the upper epidermis will undergo vacuolization, demonstrating an abundant and strongly eosinophilic cytoplasm. There may be a mild to moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate detected in the upper dermis.

File:Micrograph of squamous cell carcinoma in situ - 100x.jpgSquamous cell carcinoma in situ, showing prominent dyskeratosis and aberrant mitoses at all levels of the epidermis, along with marked parakeratosis. =In situ disease= Bowen's disease is essentially equivalent to and used interchangeably with SCC in situ, when not having invaded through the basement membrane. Depending on source, it is classified as precancerous or SCC in situ (technically cancerous but non-invasive). Updated: Jun 11, 2019 Page last reviewed: 21 May 2019 In SCC in situ (Bowen's disease), atypical squamous cells proliferate through the whole thickness of the epidermis. The entire tumor is confined to the epidermis and does not invade into the dermis. The cells are often highly atypical under the microscope, and may in fact look more unusual than the cells of some invasive squamous cell carcinomas.

Queyrat. √ârythroplasie du gland. Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de dermatologie et de syphiligraphie, Paris, 1911, 22: 378‚Äì382. who was head of the dermatology service of l'H√¥pital Ricord, a venereal hospital in Paris, now H√¥pital Cochin.Fonds d'archives, Lieu de conservation : Institut Pasteur, Service des Archives. =Invasive disease= In invasive SCC, tumor cells infiltrate through the basement membrane. The infiltrate can be somewhat difficult to detect in the early stages of invasion: however, additional indicators such as full thickness epidermal atypia and the involvement of hair follicles can be used to facilitate the diagnosis. Later stages of invasion are characterized by the formation of nests of atypical tumor cells in the dermis, often with a corresponding inflammatory infiltrate. File:Micrograph of invasive squamous cell carcinoma - 150x.jpgSuperficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCCSI). These lesions often do not show the marked pleomorphism and atypical nuclei of SCC in situ, but demonstrate early keratinocyte invasion of the dermis. File:Micrograph of invasive squamous cell carcinoma - 200x.jpgHigh magnification demonstrates the pleomorphism of the invading keratinocytes. File:Ulcer border of a squamous cell skin cancer.jpgInvasive nests with characteristic large celled centers. Ulceration (at left) is common in invasive SCC. =Degree of differentiation= File:Micrograph of well- differentiated and invasive squamous-cell carcinoma.jpgWell-differentiated (and yet invasive) SCC, showing prominent keratinization and may form ‚Äúpearllike‚Äù structures where dermal nests of keratinocytes attempt to mature in a layered fashion. Well-differentiated SCC has slightly enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with abundant amounts of cytoplasm. Intercellular bridges will frequently be visible. File:Micrograph of moderately differentiated and invasive squamous-cell carcinoma.jpgModerately differentiated lesions of invasive SCC show much less organization and maturation with significantly less keratin formation. File:Micrograph of clear-cell squamous-cell carcinoma.jpgPoorly differentiated, where attempts at keratinization are often no longer evident. This is a clear-cell squamous cell carcinoma. The dysplastic cells here infiltrate in cords through the dermis. Poorly differentiated SCC has greatly enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei demonstrating a high degree of atypia and frequent mitoses. File:Micrograph of clear-cell squamous-cell carcinoma with focus of obvious squamous-cell features, annotated.jpgPoorly differentiated clear-cell squamous cell carcinoma. For this type of SCC, immunostains will likely be required to classify it unless other areas of the tumor show obvious squamous cell features such as seen here (arrow). Prevention Appropriate sun-protective clothing, use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with at least SPF 50, and avoidance of intense sun exposure may prevent skin cancer. A 2016 review of sunscreen for preventing squamous cell skin cancer found insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether it was effective. Management Most squamous cell carcinomas are removed with surgery. A few selected cases are treated with topical medication. Surgical excision with a free margin of healthy tissue is a frequent treatment modality. Radiotherapy, given as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy), can also be used to treat squamous cell carcinomas. There is little evidence comparing the effectiveness of different treatments for non-metastatic SCC of the skin. Mohs surgery is frequently utilized; considered the treatment of choice for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, physicians have also utilized the method for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth, throat, and neck. An equivalent method of the CCPDMA standards can be utilized by a pathologist in the absence of a Mohs-trained physician. Radiation therapy is often used afterward in high risk cancer or patient types. Electrodessication and curettage or EDC can be done on selected squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In areas where SCC's are known to be non-aggressive, and where the patient is not immunosuppressed, EDC can be performed with good to adequate cure rate. Treatment options for SCC in situ (Bowen's disease) include photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid, cryotherapy, topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod, and excision. A meta-analysis showed evidence that PDT is more effective than cryotherapy and has better cosmetic outcomes. There is generally a lack of evidence comparing the effectiveness of all treatment options. High-risk squamous cell carcinoma, as defined by those occurring around the eye, ear, or nose, is of large size, is poorly differentiated, and grows rapidly, requires more aggressive, multidisciplinary management. Nodal spread: # Surgical block dissection if palpable nodes or in cases of Marjolin's ulcers but the benefit of prophylactic block lymph node dissection with Marjolin's ulcers is not proven. # Radiotherapy # Adjuvant therapy may be considered in those with high-risk SCC even in the absence of evidence for local mestastasis. Imiquimod (Aldara) has been used with success for squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the skin and the penis, but the morbidity and discomfort of the treatment is severe. An advantage is the cosmetic result: after treatment, the skin resembles normal skin without the usual scarring and morbidity associated with standard excision. Imiquimod is not FDA-approved for any squamous cell carcinoma. In general, squamous cell carcinomas have a high risk of local recurrence, and up to 50% do recur. Frequent skin exams with a dermatologist is recommended after treatment. Prognosis The long-term outcome of squamous cell carcinomas is dependent upon several factors: the sub-type of the carcinoma, available treatments, location(s) and severity, and various patient health-related variables (accompanying diseases, age, etc.). Generally, the long-term outcome is positive, as less than 4% of Squamous cell carcinoma cases are at risk of metastasis. When it does metastasize, the most common involved organs are the lungs, brain, bone and other skin locations. One study found squamous cell carcinoma of the penis had a much greater rate of mortality than some other forms of squamous cell carcinoma, that is, about 23%, although this relatively high mortality rate may be associated with possibly latent diagnosis of the disease due to patients avoiding genital exams until the symptoms are debilitating, or refusal to submit to a possibly scarring operation upon the genitalia. Squamous cell carcinoma occurring in the organ transplant population is also associated with a higher risk of mortality. Epidemiology Age-standardized death from melanoma and other skin cancers per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma continues to rise around the world. A recent study estimated that there are between 180,000 and 400,000 cases of SCC in the United States in 2013. Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma varies with age, gender, race, geography, and genetics. The incidence of SCC increases with age and the peak incidence is usually around 60 years old. Males are affected with SCC at a ratio of 2:1 in comparison to females. Caucasians are more likely to be affected, especially those with fair skin or those chronically exposed to UV radiation. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can be found on all areas of the body but is most common on frequently sun-exposed areas, such as the face, legs and arms. Solid organ transplant recipients (heart, lung, liver, pancreas, among others) are also at a heightened risk of developing aggressive, high-risk SCC. There are also a few rare congenital diseases predisposed to cutaneous malignancy. In certain geographic locations, exposure to arsenic in well water or from industrial sources may significantly increase the risk of SCC.

One of the most successful debut albums of all time, it was the first to produce three No. 1 singles on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart: \\"All That She Wants\\", \\"The Sign\\" and \\"Don't Turn Around\\". They continued to score hit singles throughout the 1990s, with songs such as \\"Beautiful Life\\", \\"Lucky Love\\", \\"Cruel Summer\\" and \\"Life Is a Flower\\". By 2002, they had sold a total of 30 million copies of their first four studio albums, making them the third most successful Swedish group of all time, after ABBA and Roxette.http://aceofbase.com/about/ Despite being largely inactive since 2012, the group has never officially disbanded. In recent years, they have released a number of demo tracks; first via their Facebook page, then in 2015 on the compilation album Hidden Gems. An expanded 2-disc edition was included in the 2020 boxset All That She Wants: The Classic Collection. Jenny Berggren continues to perform the group's hits in solo concerts worldwide. History =Formation= In 1987, following a number of years as part of a new romantic and punk cover band called G Konrad, Jonas Berggren formed a band with two friends, Johnny Lind√©n and Niklas Tr√§nk, for a school project; his sisters Linn and Jenny later joined as singers. The new band went through several names: Kalinin Prospect after an avenue in Moscow; CAD (Computer-Aided Disco); and Tech-Noir, French for black technology, after a nightclub in the film The Terminator. They toured the clubs of Sweden with self-written material, techno inspired by the likes of The KLF. Johnny left the group in 1989, and Niklas made his departure known by failing to turn up to a gig at B√§ltesp√§nnarparken in Gothenburg on August 4, 1990, instead attending a Rolling Stones concert on the other side of town. Jonas asked his friend Ulf Ekberg to stand in for Niklas. The new quartet sought a new name to make a fresh start. Linn was reported to have said: \\"No one could pronounce the name of the group and nobody could remember it.\\" They settled on Ace of Base in early 1991, after Ulf was inspired by the Mot√∂rhead song \\"Ace of Spades\\". In an interview in 2018, Ulf explained: \\"The name came out of a hangover I had on New Year‚Äôs Day. So, I was hungover, watching MTV and I saw Mot√∂rhead‚Äôs video for their song 'Ace of Spades'. I liked the name and I thought I‚Äôd play around with those words. We‚Äôre four members in this band, so I thought, 'Good. Four aces. I‚Äôll keep the ace.' Then I thought of our studio and how it‚Äôs our base.\\"https://marcandrew.ca/chitchat/aceofbase/ However, the band continued to struggle to gain recognition, partly due to the preference of heavy metal over techno in their hometown, according to singer Jenny.Happy Nation Home Video, VHS, 1997 In July 1991, they responded to a newspaper ad by producer John Ballard, who was looking for new talent. He was somewhat unsure about their potential, but did pass them on to Klas Lunding at Telegram Records, who allowed them to record demos of tracks including \\"Wheel of Fortune\\", \\"My Mind\\" and \\"Voulez-Vous Danser\\" in their newly renovated Decibel Studios. A Jamaican reggae band resided in a studio next door to theirs, leading to a collaboration of ideas. This resulted in a fusion of reggae with pop (dubbed \\"china reggae\\" by their Jamaican friends), which became the band's trademark sound. The demos failed to convince Telegram to sign the band, and other labels in Sweden still showed no sign of interest. The tracks were eventually sold for a small price to the independent Danish label Mega Records in March 1992. \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" was released as a single in Denmark in May, but it failed to chart. A small-budget music video was shot and directed in a small studio by Viking Nielsson and on re-issue in July, the single finally entered the Danish singles chart at No. 6, before rising to No. 2. =International success and Happy Nation/The Sign (1992‚Äì94)= Although \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" was a success in Denmark, a different song led Ace of Base to take off internationally. After hearing Kayo's \\"Another Mother\\", a top 20 hit in Sweden in 1990, the band decided that it was exactly the sound they wanted to create.Beatlab, SVT documentary, 2001 In early 1992, they sent producer Denniz PoP a demo tape including a song called \\"Mr. Ace\\". At first he wasn't particularly impressed, but the tape got stuck in the cassette player in his car. This resulted in him having to listen to it over and over again, and gradually he realized the song's potential. He'd lost the band's contact details, but when they called him a few months later he invited them to his SweMix studio to re-record the song in July 1992. The song became \\"All That She Wants\\", and upon its release at the end of August, it quickly climbed to No. 1 on the Danish chart while the previous single was still sitting at No. 2. Keen to rush out an LP for the Christmas market, Mega Records pressed the band for an album and it was quickly recorded and mixed within a few weeks. The album, Happy Nation, was released on November 16, 1992 in Denmark, and its success prompted interest elsewhere in Europe. A pan-European licence was signed with Metronome/PolyGram (now Universal Music), but they were turned down by the American division. Within a few months, \\"All That She Wants\\" had reached No. 3 in Sweden and had spent eight weeks at No. 1 in Germany. In various European countries, \\"Happy Nation\\" and \\"Waiting for Magic\\" were released as further singles following the release of the album. In May 1993, \\"All That She Wants\\" consolidated on its European success by topping the chart for three weeks in the United Kingdom. However, despite Mega Records's efforts to secure a distribution deal in the United States, the response was always the same: \\"This band will never work in the States.\\" Eventually, Clive Davis, founder of Arista Records, heard the song playing on the radio whilst on vacation on his yacht, and rushed to sign a licence with Mega for the Americas.https://www.avclub.com/good-timing-turned-ace-of-base-s-the-sign- into-the-luck-1823004434 By the end of October, \\"All That She Wants\\" had made its way to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as in Australia. The group had already started work on a second album, with the working title of The Sign, named after one of the new tracks they had written. Worried about sales of import copies of Happy Nation, however, Davis opted to tweak the track list of the original LP by adding three new tracks, and re-titling it The Sign. Released in the USA on November 23, 1993, it remained in the top three of the Billboard Top 200 for 26 consecutive weeks, and was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 1995 Grammy Awards. The refreshed album was released in Europe as Happy Nation (US Version). Collectively, the different versions of the album reached the No. 1 position in at least 14 countries, and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling debut albums of all time. The second U.S. single was the album's title track, \\"The Sign\\", released on December 21. It was even more successful than the first, spending six weeks at No. 1 and becoming the best-selling single of 1994. It was also a major hit internationally, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and Sweden and at No. 1 in Germany; whilst in Australia it topped the charts for four weeks. In April 1994, an obsessed German fan broke into the Berggren family home, brandishing a knife. After managing to restrain her, the band decided they needed bodyguards. Recorded at the request of Clive Davis, \\"Don't Turn Around\\" was the group's next single, which had previously been released by Tina Turner as the B-side of her single \\"Typical Male\\", and had been a UK No. 1 hit for Aswad in 1988. The cover version hit the top 5 in the US, UK, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Promotion for the album was wrapped up with the final single release \\"Living in Danger\\". It was yet another top 40 hit around the world, and was performed in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the first ever MTV Europe Music Awards in Berlin in November 1994. =The Bridge (1995‚Äì97)= Following the huge success of the first album, the group were offered the chance to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York, and were asked to front brands such as Pepsi and Reebok in promotional campaigns, but after two years of travelling around the world to promote the first album, the band were too exhausted and declined all offers.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop- shop/6502291/ace-of-base-hidden-gems-jonas-berggren At the same time, the various record companies they were signed to around the world were demanding a second album as soon as possible. To speed up the process, instead of Jonas and Ulf writing the bulk of the album, each member was encouraged to submit their own tracks for consideration. In the end, 17 tracks made the cut of the second album, titled The Bridge. It marked a considerable change of direction in sound; alongside the reggae and dance sounds that had made the group so popular were more experimental tracks and several ballads. The lead single, \\"Lucky Love\\", however, was a mainstream pop record, and was premiered in August 1995 at the World Championships in Athletics in Gothenburg. It debuted at No. 1 in Sweden upon release in October, becoming their first chart-topper in their homeland. It was also a top 20 hit across Europe, peaking at No. 1 in Finland, No. 2 in Denmark, No. 13 in Germany and No. 20 in the United Kingdom. Arista Records instead opted for the more up-tempo track \\"Beautiful Life\\" as the first single in the US, where it peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first American hit for its co-producer Max Martin, who would go on to become one of the world's most in-demand songwriters and producers. It was released as the second single from the album in most countries, also reaching No. 15 in the UK and charting in at least 17 countries. An alternative acoustic mix of \\"Lucky Love\\" was chosen as the second U.S. single, peaking at No. 30. The Bridge was certified platinum in 14 countries, but failed to come close to matching the sales of the group's first album. \\"Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry\\" was released as the third single from the album and achieved moderate success in Europe, but it failed to chart on the Hot 100 in the USA. In February 1996, the band performed at the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival in Chile, topping the bill alongside 2 Unlimited. After a tour of Asia and Australasia in April 1996, plans for a single release of \\"Edge Of Heaven\\" were scrapped, and the group retreated from the limelight for a while, emerging only in 1997 for a performance at the World Music Awards in April, and at a concert to celebrate the 20th birthday of Princess Victoria of Sweden in July. =Flowers / Cruel Summer (1998‚Äì99)= Having felt rushed to record a second album, the group were given as much time as they need to produce their third, with much of it being recorded in Jonas's own studio, \\"The Barn\\". Declaring it their best album yet, the group titled it Flowers because they believed that the songs, wildly different in style including Motown and gospel influences, resembled a varied bouquet of flowers. Fans were surprised to see that singer Linn had relinquished lead vocal duties to sister Jenny, and on many promotional photos, Linn's face was blurred. They were reassured that Linn was happy with her new backing role in the group, and many reasons were given for her decision, including her having damaged her voice, fear of flying putting her off from traveling around the world and her dislike of fame. The album's lead single \\"Life Is a Flower\\" was released in mainland Europe in April 1998, and became the most-played track on European radio of the year. It reached the top 5 in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Hungary and in the UK, where it was certified silver. The album followed in June, hitting the top 20 in at least a dozen countries. The group's British label London Records had requested the band record the 1983 hit \\"Cruel Summer\\", by Bananarama and it was selected as the second European single. Deciding that \\"Life Is a Flower\\" was \\"too European in nature\\", Clive Davis pushed \\"Cruel Summer\\" as the lead single for the United States, and it brought Ace of Base back into the U.S. Top 10 for the first time in four years, being certified gold. The album was also renamed Cruel Summer and featured a different track list compared to the European release. For this version of the album, Davis persuaded a reluctant Linn to record the Billy Steinberg-penned ballad \\"Everytime It Rains\\". \\"Life Is a Flower\\" was re-recorded as \\"Whenever You're Near Me\\" and chosen as the second single from Cruel Summer, peaking at No. 76. \\"Travel to Romantis\\" and \\"Always Have, Always Will\\" were further singles in Europe whilst \\"Everytime It Rains\\" was issued as a single in the UK along with a repackaged edition of Flowers. =Singles of the 90s and Greatest Hits (1999‚Äì2000)= The group went back into the studio in 1999, writing several tracks together as a quartet for the first time, and recording enough demo tracks for consideration for a fourth studio album. Ulf from the group later revealed that they had hoped to release a track called \\"Pole Position\\" as the lead single, with a music video that would have featured the Formula One champion driver Jacques Villeneuve.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4tpkCgONUA Several of the tracks recorded for the scrapped studio album were eventually released in demo form by Jonas via Facebook in 2011. Mega Records decided to capitalize on the group's recent resurgence in popularity by releasing a best-of album. Singles of the 90s, a compilation of 16 hit singles, was released in November 1999. A new single taken from it, \\"C'est La Vie (Always 21)\\", was a modest chart hit in Sweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, and topped the charts in Spain. \\"Hallo Hallo\\" followed as the second single in parts of Europe, but only found minor success. Arista Records fulfilled the group's four-album contract in the Americas by releasing Greatest Hits in March 2000. A new dance mix of \\"Everytime It Rains\\", previously included on Cruel Summer, was released as a radio single to promote the album. Both the single and album failed to chart in the USA. =Da Capo (2002‚Äì03)= Linn after a performance in 2002 Following a long time away from the pop scene, a new single called \\"Beautiful Morning\\" was serviced to radio in Europe in July 2002. Polydor Records reported that it was their fastest-added track to radio playlists of the year, and it went on peak at No. 38 in Germany and No. 14 in Sweden upon its commercial release in September. After several delays, Ace of Base finally released their fourth studio album, Da Capo, on September 30, 2002, in Europe, and in Japan through Toshiba EMI with a different cover and three bonus tracks. The album received only a soft release in the United Kingdom and was not released in the Americas. The title comes from the musical term da capo, which translates as \\"back to the beginning\\", chosen as the sound of the album was seen as a return to the group's early blend of reggae and europop. Although the album charted across much of Europe, it was not as successful as previous releases. Only Jenny and Ulf went on a promotional tour of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Austria. Jonas chose to forego promotional activities because \\"it was better to be two then\\" and led to \\"less questions\\" about Linn's lack of participation. Linn attended only one performance in Germany, which was her last public appearance. \\"The Juvenile\\" was selected as the album's second single in Germany, and was used for a Christmas campaign by TV channel RTL. The song was a re-written version of a track originally submitted for the James Bond movie GoldenEye in 1995. However, Clive Davis persuaded the band that it was not the best move for the band at the time so they withdrew it from consideration. In Scandinavia, Edel-Mega released \\"Unspeakable\\" as the second single, but its poor chart performance ended the promotion of the album prematurely. =Hiatus (2003‚Äì06)= The group remained out of the spotlight throughout 2003 and 2004, although Jenny kept busy by performing solo live performances in several Christian shows with her husband Jakob Petr√©n and released an album as a vocalist with the Swedish group Arose. In 2005, a handful of songs featuring vocals by both Jenny and Linn were recorded with producer Tommy Ekman, including \\"Would You Believe\\" and \\"Make My Day\\". Jonas and Ulf later explained that the group did not have the energy to finish off the project, though the tracks that were recorded eventually surfaced. At the end of 2005, the group reunited, without Linn, for several live performances at the Night of the Proms in Belgium, alongside other artists such as Donna Summer. =Reunion (2007‚Äì09)= alt=Jonas, Jenny, and Ulf performing in Jonas, Jenny and Ulf during a concert in Saint Petersburg, 2007. Ace of Base reunited as a trio to perform their first full-length concert since 1996 in Yekaterinburg, Russia, on November 15, 2007. They embarked on a world tour called Ace Of Base - Redefined!, which continued throughout 2008 and 2009. The set list included several new versions of their greatest hits. Jenny confirmed Linn's permanent departure from the group, saying \\"She hasn't been part of Ace of Base for several years\\" in Se & H√∏r Magazine. Ulf later explained in an interview \\"She left the band and we promised her to never even ask to come back. She's done with entertainment industry. It's understandable. It‚Äôs brutal from the inside, it was not for her. She has no craving to be famous, she loved her fans, but the fame factor was not for her.\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/now-ace-base/story?id=34316125 While touring, the group performed a brand new song called \\"Sparks From A Fire\\". The group teamed up with Jenny's husband Jakob to record material for a new studio album, which would consist of seven new songs and seven remakes of old hits. However, this album did not see a release and a new compilation, Greatest Hits, was released on November 12, 2008, instead. Five re-recorded songs were released from the album in various forms: \\"Lucky Love 2009\\", \\"Don't Turn Around 2009\\", \\"The Sign (Freedom Bunch Mix)\\" and \\"Wheel of Fortune 2009\\", which was released worldwide on October 24, 2008, as a digital single. A fifth reworking, \\"Happy Nation 2009\\", was released separately as a remix kit. A remake of \\"All That She Wants\\" was also recorded and featured guest vocals by Britney Spears that stemmed from her own 2007 cover of the song. This remake was never officially released, but leaked online in June 2016. Three of the new tracks recorded in this period (\\"Sparks From A Fire\\", \\"The Mask\\" and \\"Wish You Were Mine\\") were eventually leaked on YouTube in 2017. =New members, The Golden Ratio, and Ace Thursdays (2009‚Äì12)= Ace of Base performing during a fan meeting in Toronto, Canada (2010). In August 2009, in an interview with Digital Spy, Ulf mentioned adding another singer to the group alongside Jenny, explaining: \\"We're just deciding now whether to add a fourth member to the group again or to bring it out under a new name. At the moment we think it would be stronger with two female singers, so it's a little technical problem to solve.\\"https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a169975/whatever-happened-to-ace- of-base/ During this time, Ulf and Jonas began recording songs with singer Julia Williamson, whom they met through Martin Dodd, who had originally signed the group to Mega Records. Meanwhile, a new remix of \\"Cruel Summer\\" by Rico Bernasconi charted at No. 69 in Germany. Jenny published her autobiography Vinna hela V√§rlden in Sweden in September and announced that she was recording a solo album, which materialized in October 2010 as My Story. In November 2009, Jenny confirmed via Twitter that she would not be involved with the upcoming album,https://twitter.com/jennyberggren/status/6206340746 but later clarified that she had not left, saying that \\"other constellations will have other names\\".https://twitter.com/jennyberggren/status/7238010706https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=116101985084450&id;=349147288370 Two new singers were officially revealed in February 2010https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/aobfr/names-of-the-new-girls-t8379.html as Clara Hagman, a contestant from Idol 2009, who Ulf met whilst appearing as a guest judge on the show, and Julia Williamson. Jonas explained that \\"We will reform how we write the band name so that all old Acers can see the difference and don't have to be in panic.\\",https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/aobfr/official-message-by- jonas-t8385.html with Jenny commenting in April, \\"You are wrong about me leaving Ace of Base. I just want to make everybody sure I have not left the group. Ace of Base is still the original members. We are bounded by law and by heart.\\" In a later interview with Aftonbladet, Jenny claimed \\"They didn't want to be with me\\", and that she was not allowed to participate in songwriting.https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/a/G10EdB/de-ville- inte-ha-med-mig Jonas and Ulf then said in an interview with Scandipop that Jenny wasn't happy with plans to introduce a new member, and while she never formally quit the group, they felt that they had no choice but to proceed without her.https://www.scandipop.co.uk/the-ace-of-base-interview/ The new quartet maintained the original band name, but it was stylized as \\"Ace.of.Base\\" on the artwork of single and album releases. In July 2010, a track called \\"Mr. Replay\\" appeared on a Polish promo compilation for DJs, becoming the first release from the new line-up. The first official single from the line-up, \\"All for You\\", was premiered on radio station Antenne AC on July 22, and was released on CD and download on September 10, debuting at No. 38 in Germany. The album The Golden Ratio followed on September 24, entering the German album charts at No. 20. In Sweden, the album failed to chart, backed only by a radio release of the album's title track \\"The Golden Ratio\\" in October,https://www.facebook.com/aceofbase/posts/155169684522524 followed by a performance of \\"Southern California\\" on Bingolotto in April 2011. An acoustic version of the album was being considered but never materialized. No further singles were released in support of the album. In March 2011, Jonas began releasing previously unreleased material to fans via the band's official Facebook page and the website ReverbNation on a semi-regular basis, in events they referred to as \\"Ace Thursdays\\". Writing sessions for new material took place throughout the same year, though following the group's tour of Canada and Brazil in 2011, new music was put on hold. =Departures, Hidden Gems and 30th anniversary (2012‚Äìpresent)= Ace Thursdays continued throughout 2012, but were discontinued in May 2013. In November 2012, Jenny was quoted as saying, \\"The rest of the band are doing other things. ... We‚Äôre just wishing each other luck at this stage. I have a dream that we‚Äôll get back together, so I don‚Äôt want to bang anyone on the head\\". Jenny began touring as \\"Jenny from Ace of Base\\" alongside popular Eurodance acts from the decade. In January 2014, Julia announced on her official Facebook page that she had left the group in 2012. She later confirmed that Clara had also left, saying on her Facebook page, \\"I never really left the group, one day I just didn't hear anything from them and it's the same with Clara. Like it went up in smoke; really strange\\". Clara has since gone to release a number of solo singles, and has collaborated with various EDM producers such as KREAM and R3hab. A remix EP was released in July 2014, featuring new remixes of \\"All That She Wants\\". On September 27, Jonas announced that members were filming a documentary chronicling the production of \\"All That She Wants\\" at Google headquarters. The documentary was aired on the Swedish channel SVT as part of the Hitl√•tens Historia series on March 18, 2015. In December 2014 and January 2015, remastered versions of their first four studio albums, in both European and American editions, were released digitally. Each release featured a bonus demo or B-side track. This was followed in March by Hidden Gems, a compilation album consisting entirely of demos and b-sides, which was released on CD, vinyl and download. \\"Would You Believe\\", one of the last tracks recorded by the original quartet in 2005, was released as a promotional single. In a 2015 interview with ABC News, Ulf said of a future reunion, \\"With the right elements in the next few years, I don‚Äôt think it's impossible\\"; however, in July 2016, Jenny remarked: \\"We won‚Äôt re-form. [...] We‚Äôre finished working together but we‚Äôre not finished being family together. We have a lot of fun plans in the future but no musical plans\\". Asked by Kyle Meredith on his podcast in 2018 about the possibility of the group working together again, Jonas said \\"I've talked to Jenny a little bit about it, to do something, but most people want to have all four of us... it's difficult to do something that is interesting to people. We did some good stuff [as a trio] I think, but we always got the same question \\"where is Malin?\\". I am still writing music, maybe one song each fortnight or something. It's a lot of fun, like therapy. And maybe if we do a reunion... I have songs for it!\\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/06/ace-of-base-kyle-meredith/ In 2019, Demon Music Group began releasing new compilations of the band's material in the United Kingdom. The first of these releases was Ace Of Base ‚Äì Gold, which charted at No. 59 in the UK, marking the group's first return to the UK charts in 20 years. To mark the group's 30th anniversary, a 12-disc box set called All That She Wants: The Classic Collection was released in July 2020. The set includes deluxe versions of the group's original four studio albums, an expanded 46-track edition of Hidden Gems, a new EP containing previously unreleased remixes of \\"Edge Of Heaven\\", and a DVD containing every music video. Included among the 195 tracks are previously unreleased demos from the original line-up's final recording sessions in 2008 and live recordings of the group's first gig at B√§ltesp√§nnarparken in 1990. A coloured vinyl box set was also released which only includes the four studio albums. Legacy A number of musicians and singers have been influenced by Ace of Base. Lady Gaga has said her album The Fame Monster was influenced by the \\"super pop melodies of the 90s\\" by acts such as Ace of Base. The song \\"Alejandro\\" in particular has been heavily compared to Ace of Base's version of \\"Don't Turn Around\\"; Paul Lester from BBC commented that \\"[Alejandro] moves at an Ace of Base pace\\", and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as a homage to them; The song \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" from The Fame has also been linked to the band; Alexis Petridis from The Guardian noted that the song \\"is the first song in a long time that warrants comparison to the ≈ìuvre of Ace of Base\\". Katy Perry said she wanted her third studio album, Teenage Dream, to sound like \\"The Sign\\"; \\"It's what I said I wanted earlier\\", she told MTV; \\"We nailed it: It's roller-skating! It's '90s! It's Ace of Base! It's Cyndi Lauper! It's like all these colors and more\\". Swedish artist Robyn said she was inspired by Ace of Base for her song \\"Dancehall Queen\\", which was produced by Diplo and Klas √Öhlund for her fifth studio album Body Talk Pt. 1. \\"We were just having fun with that kind of genre music. And the idea of making this song came out of that discussion. It was fun. We really connected on something where music that you might put in one box becomes something else, depending on how you look at it\\". Some of the British group Clean Bandit's tracks have been compared to the band, notably their 2016 UK No. 1 single \\"Rockabye\\".

In 2009, Omega Red was ranked as IGN's 95th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.Omega Red is number 95 IGN. Retrieved 10-05-09. Publication history Omega Red first appeared in X-Men #4 (vol. 2, January 1992), and was created by Jim Lee and John Byrne. Fictional character biography Little is known about the past of Arkady Gregorivich Rossovich except that he was a serial killer born in Soviet Russia. He was captured by the Interpol agent Sean Cassidy and turned over to the KGB, which wanted to experiment and attempt to create a supersoldier similar to Captain America. Omega Red is the end result.Generation X #11 In another version of Omega Red's past, Arkady was a Soviet soldier stationed in a small Siberian town. He was a murderer; his crimes easily discoverable due to the town's small size and limited number of potential victims. He was caught by his fellow soldiers and summarily executed via a gunshot to the back of the head. His superiors are astonished when Arkady survives the execution, and recommend him for the aforementioned Soviet super soldier project, a brutal process; it is suggested that Arkady survives solely due to his evil and cruel nature. He becomes an operative for Soviet intelligence and the KGB.Maverick: In the Shadow of Death #1, 1997 The Soviet government implanted a retractable carbonadium tentacle within each of Omega Red's arms. Carbonadium was the Soviets' attempt to recreate the artificial alloy known as adamantium, as Carbonadium is a more malleable form of adamantium. He uses them as weapons and as grappling appendages. He is able to a wrap a victim in his coils to drain them of their \\"life\\" energy. This vampiric tendency is essential to Omega Red's survival; the carbonadium implants, while great offensive weapons, slowly poisoned him and he was required to regularly drain the life energy of a person, or perhaps take small amounts from larger numbers of individuals, in order to temporarily sustain his immune system. In order to stabilize his condition, Omega Red requires the \\"Carbonadium Synthesizer,\\" a device that was stolen by Wolverine, Maverick, and Sabretooth during their final mission together as \\"Team X\\" and attempted rescue of double agent Janice Hollenbeck in the 1960s.as revealed in X-Men Vol. 2 #6 It is because of his need for the Carbonadium Synthesizer that Omega Red has continuously sought out these three individuals over the years, believing they may know of its whereabouts. While Sabretooth and Maverick might have been aware of its location, it was eventually revealed that Wolverine actually does know where it is.Wolverine: Origins #31 Omega Red also battled John Wraith in Berlin at that time.Wolverine #61 At some time in the past the Soviet government decided that Omega Red was too unpredictable and treacherous to be relied upon, and so needed to be put in cryogenic suspended animation until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of Communism in Russia he was revived from suspended animation by Matsu'o Tsurayaba, who led his own renegade faction of the clan of ninja known as The Hand. Omega Red became a warrior serving Matsu'o Tsurayaba and was led to believe that Wolverine knew the whereabouts of the Carbonadium Synthesizer which could save his life, and sought him out in an effort to find this device. In doing so, he came into conflict with the X-Men many times. In their first encounter in modern times, Omega Red captured Wolverine.X-Men Vol. 2 #4 He fought and defeated Wolverine, and brought him to Tsurayaba, Fenris, and Cornelius in Berlin.X-Men Vol. 2 #5 He battled the X-Men,X-Men Vol. 2 #6 and was wounded by Psylocke and defeated by the X-Men and Maverick but escaped.X-Men Vol. 2 #7 Later, Omega Red battled and fell under the mental control of the Soul Skinner in Siberia. The Soul Skinner then used him to battle Wolverine and the X-Men. Omega Red was able to subdue the team and capture Wolverine and Jubilee and was then sent to capture Colossus, who had retreated. Omega Red eluded capture by Wolverine after the Soul Skinner's death.X-Men Vol. 2 #18-19 He later fought against Chamber of Generation X, but suffered a humiliating defeat.Generation X #11 Ultimately, Omega Red failed to eliminate Wolverine and proved to be no more loyal to the Hand than he was to the Soviet government. He has worked for Neocommunist organizations and tried to kill a member of the Americomp organization, but was stopped by Daredevil and Black Widow. Omega Red was later employed by Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin to incite a war between the terrorist organization HYDRA and the technology suppliers A. I. M. While working for the drug lord known as the General, Omega Red was recruited by Sabretooth to attack Wolverine's friends and family alongside Lady Deathstrike. Sabretooth had promised both Omega Red and Deathstrike information on almost every mutant on Earth, but betrayed his new henchmen by teleporting away with Wolverine, his ward Amiko, and the information. Omega Red is currently a crime lord (head of the Red Mafia) who poses as a legitimate business man, much like Wilson Fisk does in the U.S. At present, Omega Red has resumed his search for the Carbonadium Synthesizer. In Wolverine: Origins #6 and #7, Omega Red locates former Team X member, and now one of the numerous depowered mutants, Agent Zero a.k.a. Maverick, who is the only person that knows the location of the Carbonadium Synthesizer. This brings him into direct confrontation with Wolverine, who has also sought out Maverick in hopes of locating the Carbonadium Synthesizer. The result of this encounter is that Wolverine outsmarts Omega Red, landing him in the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D. Months later it becomes known that the Red Room bought Omega Red's freedom with the hopes of using him to their own ends. Wolverine, Colossus, and Nightcrawler encounter him after he has freed himself from his master, however, and they engage in combat. Omega Red is largely impervious to Wolverine's claws; the Red Room had been experimenting on his body in an effort to enhance his healing factor. After Nightcrawler intervenes and knocks Omega Red unconscious, he is returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.Uncanny X-Men 497‚Äì499 Thanks to the enigmatic Romulus, Omega Red is transferred to a regular Russian prison to set a trap for Wolverine. Aided by Wild Child, their plan consisted of dropping Logan into molten steel. However, as Wild Child was preparing to finish the job, Omega Red interrupted him. While Wild Child and Omega Red battle each other, Logan managed to flee. A distracted Wild Child is consequently thrown into the molten steel by Omega Red after having his chest punctured.Wolverine: Origins #39 Omega Red was killed after being stabbed in the heart with the Muramasa blade by Wolverine.Wolverine Origins #39 Omega Red later appears in Hell attempting to attack Wolverine by binding him with his tentacles, but is quickly taken down when Wolverine grabs him by the tentacles and flips him over.Wolverine vol. 4 #3 The body of Arkady Rossovich was later obtained by some Russian members of the Church of St. Mitrophan who, after a mystical ceremony, made by their magiks were able to raise Omega Red back to life. However, the procedure is only temporary, as the grave will continue to call Arkady, nevertheless they reassure him that they will continue searching for a way to overcome this limitation.X-Men Gold #9 The limitation was eventually solved when the Russian Mafia used the abilities of X-Man Magik to restore Omega Red's to his fullest strength, but ultimately he was nevertheless defeated and delivered to the custody of S.I.C.K.L.E. (the Russian version of S.H.I.E.L.D.).X-Men Gold #10 Arriving bloodied and beaten at Krakoa and seeking asylum, Omega Red is met by Wolverine, who tries to persuade Magneto that Arkady is too dangerous to be allowed on the island, as he poses to serious a threat to the women and children living there. Investigating his claims of a secret vampire enclave hidden in Paris, Wolverine is captured by Vlad Dracula, who has rejuvenated himself by drinking his blood. As per their agreement, Dracula presents Omega Red with the Carbonadium Synthesizer, warning him that it now contains a detonator, whereupon Arkady will serve as a spy in the service of Vlad to aid against any interference from the mutants towards the Vampire Nation's hidden agenda.Wolverine Vol. 7 #1 Powers and abilities Omega Red is a mutant with superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and the ability to secrete pheromones from his body typically referred to as Death Spores. The death spores result in the weakness or death of humans in his immediate vicinity. The severity of the effect is based on the endurance, health, and relative proximity of the victims. The spores are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds, though some superhumanly powered beings can withstand exposure to them for extended periods of time. Implanted within Omega Red's arms are long retractable tendril-like coils made of carbonadium, an artificial alloy that is the former Soviet Union's attempt at creating true adamantium. Carbonadium is more malleable than adamantium and, while being vastly stronger than steel, is considerably less durable than adamantium. Carbonadium, however, is for all practical purposes virtually indestructible. Omega Red can cause the coils to shoot forward from openings in the undersides of his wrists in order to ensnare his victims. Omega Red is able to use the tentacles as highly effective offensive weapons, often brandishing them like whips during combat. The natural durability of the tentacles, combined with his physical strength, are sufficient to cause damage to most conventional materials. Omega Red also has superhuman levels of stamina sufficient to engage Wolverine in combat continuously for over eighteen hours with no signs of fatigue. His bodily tissues are harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than those of an ordinary human. While he is not invulnerable, his body can withstand great impact and blunt trauma forces that would result in severe injury or death in an ordinary human. However, his resistance to injury is considerably enhanced due to the red carbonadium armor that he wears, which has been sufficient to allow him to withstand powerful energy blasts from the likes of Chamber, and Wolverine's claws, without sustaining injury. Omega Red has the ability, and need, to drain the life force of victims with his pheromones in order to sustain his own. Omega Red can likewise ensnare his victims within his tentacles, and use the coils as a conduit for his lethal pheromones. Due to the mutant \\"death factor\\" and the presence of the carbonadium within his body, Omega Red must drain the life force of others on a regular basis in order to sustain his own physical health and remain active. Omega Red can use these absorbed energies to, temporarily, increase his body's healing capabilities to the point where he can fully heal from a punctured lung within a few minutes. Only a device known as the Carbonadium Synthesizer can stabilize his condition, as carbonadium is the only metal that can neutralize the \\"death factor,\\" thereby stabilizing it within his body. Omega Red is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and military tactician. He was trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat by both the Soviet government and various organizations throughout the Japanese and Russian criminal underworlds. Highly intelligent, he has quickly become highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations. Omega Clan Following the demise of Omega Red, a secret organization known as \\"The White Sky\\" which is specialized in growing and programming unique assassins to meet all their clients' expectations, were hired to create three \\"clones\\" from the remains of the original Omega Red. Each of these clones have different abilities from each other and they passionately hate X-Force just for the fact they were implanted with false memories to believe that X-Force members had killed their father.Uncanny X-Force #25 The Omega Clan is composed by: * Omega Black ‚Äì A female clone of Omega Red, she goes by the programmed name of Sylvia Engel Rossovich.Uncanny X-Force #26Uncanny X-Force #34 Omega Black's chest is implanted with five retractable Carbonadium tendrils which she can use to affect people with diseases, such as cancer. * Omega White ‚Äì A male clone of Omega Red, he has the power to create energy constructs similar to Omega Red's coils which he uses to drain the psychic energy and life force from his enemies. He's also able to render himself intangible, thus becoming immune to physical attacks. * Omega Red ‚Äì A male clone of Omega Red, in fact he is the closest member in terms of appearance and powers to the original Omega Red. =Confrontation with X-Force= When Wade Wilson tried to infiltrate the White Sky facility, he was discovered and battle the Omega Clan.Uncanny X-Force #25 He was quickly backed up by fellow X-Force members: Wolverine and Nightcrawler. Both of them were tortured by the three clones, until Deadpool managed to stop them by sending his own White Sky creation: Alpha Achromic.Uncanny X-Force #26 Soon after that battle, the Omega Clan revealed itself as part of Daken's Brotherhood.Uncanny X-Force #27 The whole Brotherhood hid for a time in an underwater secret base,Uncanny X-Force #30 in order to push Evan Sabahnur, Apocalypse's clone, into the Brotherhood's own Apocalypse.Uncanny X-Force #31 When X-Force infiltrated the base, Omega Black was the one along Daken and Blob to stop Deadpool while he was trying to extract Evan. After being captured, Wade was inspected by Sylvia in order to remove his telepathic dampening device, and once Farouk had probed his mind, Omega Black was asked to kill Wade by filling his head with cancer.Uncanny X-Force #32 Intent on doing what was asked of her, she tried to finish the job by beating him up with a wrench, only stopping when she was asked to bring Evan to see Wolverine drowning, in order to push him to wear the Celestial Armor and ascend as Apocalypse. As Daken was beating him to death to make him reveal his nature as Wolverine, Omega Black stopped him and brought the boy back to the torture room with Deadpool, and then left, while Evan wore the Celestial Armor to end this.Uncanny X-Force #33 With the Celestial Armor on, Evan fought back and freed his friends, seemingly killing Omega Red in the process. Omega White tried to avenge his \\"brother\\" but Psylocke mind- controlled him in order to absorb the Shadow King's, and then erased Omega White's mind, leaving the Shadow King trapped in a brain-dead corpse. With the Brotherhood tore apart Black Omega was somehow able to escape the base. Omega White's body was later entrusted to Brian Braddock's care.X-Force #34 =Subsequent whereabouts= It was revealed that Omega Red was able to survive Evan's attack and started a mercenary career, working for Roxxon.Deadpool vol. 3 #41 When he clashed with Deadpool, he tried to have revenge on him for the false memories implanted on him.Deadpool vol. 3 #42 After clashing with Deadpool numerous times, the mercenary convinced him that the memories of his past were false, and that just like him, Omega Red needed to realize he wouldn't be controlled by those who transformed them into monsters. Both called a truce, and Omega Red left Deadpool alone, unless he discovered he had actually murdered his family.Deadpool vol.3 #44 Omega Black has since reappeared too, with the revelation that she had become a vessel for Shadow King which the Crimson Pirates were supposed to give to Tullamore Voge.Nightcrawler #08 In the \\"Return of Wolverine\\" mini-series, Omega Red appeared as a masked sniper at a work camp owned by Soteira. A revived Wolverine sees him shooting a fleeing scientist. Upon Wolverine returning fire, Omega Red shoots out the front tire of Wolverine's motorcycle.Return of Wolverine #1. Marvel Comics. While on the ocean, Omega Red and a revived Daken attack the speedboat that Wolverine and Ana are on. Omega Red is shot off the boat by Ana using the speedboat's harpoon gun.Return of Wolverine #2. Marvel Comics. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" timeline, there is a different version of Omega Red known only as Rossovich. Instead of a homicidal maniac, Rossovich appeared more sane and business-like. He had ties to the mutant underground and the black market. He ended up face- to-face with Domino and Grizzly, who appeared to take his life when he couldn't provide them with the information they needed.X-Man #2 (1995) After the death of Apocalypse and the ascension of Weapon X into Weapon Omega, the heir of Apocalypse, it was mentioned that Rossovich had, in fact, survived and had returned to his country where under the alias of Omega Red had built an army strong enough to overrun most of Asia and Eastern Europe with relative ease. When Weapon Omega was eventually deposed, the threat from Omega Red to the East was expected, yet the first wave never came and it never would, as Omega Red had been given the knowledge that the canister containing the Apocalypse power was now in Prophet's possession.Age of Apocalypse #13 =Days of Future Now= In the \\"Days of Future Now\\" story, Omega Red is a member of X-Force. =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Omega Red is an enemy of Spider-Man. He is depicted as a mutant with a hatred of humans. At some point, he had been hired to attack a cargo ship belonging to Roxxon Industries as a conspiracy against its leader Donald Roxxon. After his fight with Spider-Man, he was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. However, he managed to escape when the Green Goblin escaped. His defeat by Spider-Man became public knowledge because of articles written by J. Jonah Jameson detailing his humiliation. Subsequently, his former clients blacklisted him. He blamed Jameson for the loss of his livelihood. When Jameson began writing articles critical of Roxxon, Omega Red went to the Daily Bugle office disguised as a janitor and ambushed Jameson in his office with the intent to do Roxxon a high-profile favor and restore his mercenary career. Unfortunately, Peter Parker happened to be in the Bugle office that day. Changing into his Spider- Man costume and bursting through Jameson's office window, he quickly subdued Omega Red, ultimately knocking him unconscious with a vending machine.Ultimate Spider-Man #86 His tentacles extend from the tops of his wrists instead of the bottom and appear to be organic, not artificial. He has demonstrated superhuman strength.Ultimate Spider-Man #87 He is later imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Triskelion, and freed in a breakout by Electro hired by Norman Osborn along with Kraven, and Gwen Stacy, a.k.a. Carnage.Ultimate Spider-Man #113 Several months later after the death of Spider-Man, Omega Red is seen resuming his work but is stopped by the second Spider-Man.Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #7 In other media =Television= *Omega Red appears in the episodes \\"Red Dawn\\" and \\"A Deal with the Devil\\" of X-Men, voiced by Len Doncheff.Len Doncheff Biography In the original X-Men TV series produced by Saban, Omega Red claimed that the armor, like his tentacles, was made of carbonadium. In the episode \\"Red Dawn\\", Omega Red is depicted as a Soviet patriot fighting to restore the collapsed Soviet Union while in the episode \\"A Deal with the Devil\\", he is seen intending to use nuclear warheads found within a sunken Soviet submarine to destroy major world capitals as part of a plot to take over the world by first plunging it into chaos. Omega Red is last seen trapped in the submarine at the bottom of the sea. *Omega Red appears in the episode \\"Target X\\" of X-Men: Evolution, voiced by Richard Newman. He is depicted as working alongside HYDRA as part of a deal to get revenge on Wolverine for something the Weapon X program did. Wolverine has no memory of who Omega Red is or what they did to him, but he swears vengeance upon them all, including Sabretooth, Wraith and Maverick. He was paired up with a HYDRA operative named Gauntlet to capture Wolverine and also ran afoul of X-23. With help from some HYDRA agents, Gauntlet and Omega Red managed to capture Wolverine and X-23 and brought them to the HYDRA Base where Madame Hydra is. While in the HYDRA base, Omega Red planned to torture Wolverine, but it backfires and Logan is set free and he eventually defeats him by electrocuting one of his tentacles. After the aircraft that Madame Hydra and Gauntlet were in crashes, Omega Red is then arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. *Omega Red appears in Marvel Anime: Wolverine, voiced by Ryuzaburo Otomo in the Japanese version and by JB Blanc in the English dub. =Film= * Omega Red has appeared in the Hulk Vs segment \\"Hulk Vs Wolverine\\", voiced by Colin Murdock.

Whereas the prices of newly manufactured products depends mostly on the cost of production (the cost of inputs used to produce them, which in turn reflects the scarcity of the inputs), the prices of many goods‚Äîsuch as antiques, rare stamps, and those raw materials in high demand‚Äîreflects the scarcity of the products themselves. Mathur P.N. (1991) The Role of Scarcity Value and Market Price. In: Why Developing Countries Fail to Develop. Palgrave Macmillan, London. In terms of partial-equilibrium supply and demand, the markets where prices are \\"cost- determined\\" have a supply curve that is very elastic or even horizontal, so that an increase in demand raises the quantity of production much more than the price. The price mostly reflects the scarcity of the inputs but not that of the product. On the other hand, those items with scarcity value have inelastic or even vertical supply curves, so that an increase in the demand for the product mostly increases the price and not the quantity supplied. The seller of the product receives a price higher than the cost of producing the item and so receives a significant scarcity rent or producer's surplus when demand is high. Note that the cost of production may be close to zero, as with a rare stamp, so that the entire price consists of scarcity rent.Fromkin, H. L., Olson, J. C, Dipboye, R. L., & Barnaby, D. (1971). A commodity theory analysis of consumer preferences for scarce products. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association, 6, 653-654 In a contribution by biologists Courchamp et al. (2006) it is argued that rarity value (as they call scarcity value) may sometimes contribute to the over- exploitation of wildlife or rare biological systems. Rarity leads to a high unit price of a species, hence to higher incentives to catch, which in turn increases rarity, inducing a higher price, higher incentives, and so on. An ongoing example of this kind of economic‚Äìbiological feedback might be the case of the bluefin tuna. In literature \\"Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all.

The device is designed to flatten the material (e.g. concrete or asphalt) below it, which is also known as screed.  Description  The free floating screed has a number of forces acting on it that, when in equilibrium, allow the depth behind the screed to be constant. * Tow arm pull: the force exerted on the screed by the paver dragging it * Mass: the weight of the screed * Resistance of the head of material: the opposing force exerted on the screed by the pile of material in front of the screed. This force depends in turn on the material's viscosity and mass. The angle at which the tow arm pull is exerted on the screed also contributes to the motion; its resultant force is either added or subtracted from the mass of the screed. If each of these forces is constant, altering the angle of the screed to the horizontal (angle of attack) will control the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Increasing the angle of attack will cause the screed to climb higher through the pile of material, and therefore raise its trailing edge, increasing the amount of material extruded behind the screed. Similarly, reducing the angle of attack will reduce the amount of material extruded. The free floating screed has become standard because of the smoothing or averaging effect it can have on the existing base course. Since the only connection between the asphalt paver and the screed is the tow arm, the screed can \\"float\\" vertically relative to the paver. This allows the paver to traverse uneven ground while the screed floats over the material placed in front of it.  Patent  The company Barber Greene dominated the market for free floating screed equipment until the patent expired in 1955, and now all major asphalt paver manufacturers use this design principle in their equipment.

Anastasio Somoza started a dynasty that maintained absolute control over Nicaragua for 42 years. The son of a wealthy coffee planter, Somoza was educated in the United States. After his return to Nicaragua, he helped oust President Adolfo D√≠az. He became the foreign secretary and took the title of \\"General\\". With the help of the US Marine Corps, which occupied Nicaragua at the time, Somoza became the head of the National Guard. This gave him the power base to remove his wife's uncle, Juan Bautista Sacasa, from the presidency, and make himself president in 1937. In 1947, an ally nominally succeeded him, but he retained power. A month after his successor had been inaugurated, Somoza used the military to carry out a coup. The president was declared 'incapacitated' by Congress and Somoza served in his stead. Returning to power in his own name in 1951, he maintained an iron grip on his own Liberal Party while making a deal with the Conservatives; thus, he faced no opposition. This left him free to amass a huge personal fortune. On 21 September 1956, he was shot by poet Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez. Mortally wounded, he was flown to the Panama Canal Zone where he died a week later. His eldest son Luis Somoza Debayle, who was Speaker of the House at the time of Somoza Garcia's death, took over and was elected in his own right in 1957 to serve until 1963, to be succeeded by Dr. Rene Schick who served until his death in 1966. His term was completed by Lorenzo Guerrero. In 1967 his younger brother Anastasio Somoza Debayle was elected to serve until 1972. He was reelected in 1974 after a Constituent Assembly that lasted from 1972 to 1974. During that time the country was ruled by a coalition junta of conservatives and Liberals. Somoza Debayle was forced to resign in 1979 and was assassinated in exile in Paraguay the following year. Biography Somoza was born in San Marcos, Carazo Department in Nicaragua, the son of Anastasio Somoza Reyes, a wealthy coffee planter, and Julia Garc√≠a, and a grandson of Anastasio Somoza Mart√≠nez and Isabel Reyes. As a teenager, he was sent to live with relatives in Philadelphia, where he attended the Peirce School of Business Administration (now Peirce College).Fassl, Carl. Perice Means Business, Philadelphia Peirce, 1989 While living in Philadelphia, he met his future wife, Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, a member of one of Nicaragua's wealthiest families, daughter of Dr. Luis Henri Debayle Pallais and wife Casimira Sacasa Sacasa, daughter of Roberto Sacasa Sarria, 44th and 46th President of Nicaragua, and wife and cousin √Ångela Sacasa Cuadra. After returning to Nicaragua, he was unsuccessful as a businessman. =Marriage and family= He married Salvadora in 1919. They had two sons, Luis Somoza Debayle and Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and a daughter, Lillian Somoza Debayle de Sevilla Sacasa. =Early political career= Augusto C√©sar Sandino. In 1926, Somoza joined the Liberal rebellion in support of the presidential claims of Juan Bautista Sacasa, his wife's uncle. Somoza failed to distinguish himself in battle, leading an unsuccessful attack on the garrison at San Marcos. However, as a result of being educated in the United States, he spoke excellent English and acted as an interpreter during the U.S.-brokered negotiations between the warring parties. In the government of President Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada, to whom he was distantly related, he served as governor of the department of Le√≥n, Nicaraguan Consul to Costa Rica, and Foreign Minister. Despite his limited military experience, Somoza was able to rise through the ranks of the Nicaraguan National Guard (), the constabulary force organized by the United States Marines. =Somoza and Sandino= After waging a bitter, six-year struggle with the forces of General Augusto Sandino, in January 1933, the Marines evacuated the country following the election of Juan Bautista Sacasa as president. At the urging of the U.S. Ambassador Matthew E. Hanna, Somoza Garc√≠a was appointed as director of the National Guard. During peace talks, Somoza ordered the assassination of General Sandino on 21 February 1934 in violation of a safe-conduct agreement. Sandino's assassination was followed by the murder of former Sandino supporters by the National Guard. In June 1936, Somoza forced Sacasa to resign. =Ruler of Nicaragua= Somoza (left), with Argentine President Juan Per√≥n, in 1953. Somoza's control of the Government A series of puppets ruled for the remainder of the year, and, in December, Somoza was elected president by a margin of 107,201 votes to 100‚Äîan implausibly high margin that could have been obtained only through massive fraud. He took office on New Year's Day 1937.'The End and the Beginning; The Nicaraguan Revolution' John A. Booth, Pg. 66‚Äì68 Somoza, popularly known as \\"Tacho\\", amended the Constitution to centralize all power in his hands. Family members and key supporters monopolized key positions in the government and military. Nicaragua World War II During World War II, the government confiscated the properties of Nicaragua's small, but economically influential German community and sold them to Somoza and his family at vastly lowered prices. By 1944, Somoza was the largest landowner in Nicaragua, owning fifty-one cattle ranches and forty-six coffee plantations, as well as several sugar mills and rum distilleries. Somoza named himself director of the Pacific Railroad, linking Managua to the nation's principal port, Corinto, which moved his merchandise and crops for free and maintained his vehicles and agricultural equipment. He also made substantial profits by granting concessions to foreign (primarily U.S.) companies to exploit gold, rubber, and timber, for which he received 'executive levies' and 'presidential commissions.' He passed laws restricting imports and organized contraband operations, which sold merchandise through his own stores. He also extracted bribes from illegal gambling, prostitution, and alcohol distilling. By the end of the decade, he had acquired a fortune estimated to be US$400 million.Nicaragua Country Study: The Somoza Era, 1936‚Äì74 Though Nicaragua was on the Lend Lease in World War II, the unwillingness of Nicaragua to actually fight meant it was given obsolete equipment (most of it being either purchased from Russia, Spain and Portugal or captured German equipment) and no Western training. Democratic Window In 1944, under pressure from the U.S., Somoza agreed to liberalize his rule. Unions were legalized, and he agreed not to run for re-election in 1947. The Nationalist Liberal Party nominated an elderly doctor named Leonardo Arg√ºello, with Somoza using the National Guard to secure his election. Somoza intended for Arg√ºello to be a mere puppet and to keep real power in his own hands until he could run again in 1952. However, upon being sworn in as president in May 1947, Arg√ºello displayed considerable independence, attempting to reduce the power of the National Guard and the control of Somoza and his associates over the economy. Less than a month later, Somoza orchestrated another coup, naming one of his wife's uncles, Benjam√≠n Lacayo, as president. This definitively ended any hopes for further democratization in Nicaragua under the Somoza regime. Second Presidency When the administration of U.S. President Harry Truman refused to recognize the new government, a Constituent Assembly was convened, which appointed Somoza's uncle, V√≠ctor Manuel Rom√°n y Reyes, as president. In another heavily rigged election, Somoza Garc√≠a again became president in 1950. In the 1950s, he reorganized and streamlined his business empire, founding a merchant marine company, several textile mills, a national airline (LANICA, short for L√≠neas A√©reas de Nicaragua) and a new container port on the Pacific near Managua, which he named Puerto Somoza. (After the Sandinistas came to power they renamed it Puerto Sandino). He also acquired properties in the United States and Canada. =Assassination and legacy= In 1955, the constitution was amended to allow him to run for another term. Shortly after being nominated, he was shot on 21 September 1956 by the poet Rigoberto L√≥pez P√©rez in the city of Le√≥n, and died several days later in a Panama Canal Zone hospital. His older son, Luis Somoza, succeeded him. Somoza's sons, Luis and Anastasio Somoza Debayle, ruled the country directly or through figurehead politicians for the next 23 years. Despite widespread corruption and repression of dissent, they were able to receive support from the United States, which viewed them as anti-communist stalwarts and a source of stability.Gilbert, Dennis, 1988. Sandinistas: The Party and the Revolution. Mass.: Basil Blackwell His daughter Lillian Somoza Debayle, born in Le√≥n, Nicaragua, on 3 May 1921, married Guillermo Sevilla Sacasa, Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United States during his brother-in-law's rule. He also had a son named Jos√© R. Somoza, born to an unknown mother. Somoza is entombed with his oldest son at Cementerio Occidental in the National Guard Mausoleum in Managua, Nicaragua. (He should not be confused with his son, Somoza DeBayle, also a former Nicaraguan dictator, who is entombed in Miami.) \\"Our Son of a Bitch\\" Although Somoza was recognized as a ruthless dictator, the United States continued to support his regime as a non-communist stronghold in Nicaragua. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) supposedly remarked in 1939 that \\"Somoza may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.\\" According to historian David Schmitz, however, researchers and archivists who have searched the archives of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library have found no evidence that Roosevelt ever made this statement. The statement first appeared in the 15 November 1948 issue of Time magazine and was later mentioned in a 17 March 1960 broadcast of CBS Reports called \\"Trujillo: Portrait of a Dictator\\". In this broadcast, however, it was asserted that FDR made the statement in reference to Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. It should be further noted that this statement has been attributed to a variety of United States presidential administrations in regard to foreign dictators. Thus the statement remains apocryphal at this point, though Roosevelt and later presidents certainly supported the Somoza family and their rule over Nicaragua.Schmitz, David. Thank God They're on Our Side: The United States & Right-Wing Dictatorships, University of North Carolina Press, 1999, pages 3, 313. Andrew Crawley claims that the Roosevelt statement is a myth created by Somoza himself.Somoza and Roosevelt: good neighbour diplomacy in Nicaragua, 1933‚Äì1945 by Andrew Crawley.

In this text Aristotle offers an account of œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ, which refers to poetry or more literally \\"the poetic art,\\" deriving from the term for \\"poet; author; maker,\\" œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒÆœÇ. Aristotle divides the art of poetry into verse drama (to include comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play), lyric poetry, and epic. The genres all share the function of mimesis, or imitation of life, but differ in three ways that Aristotle describes: # Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter and melody. # Difference of goodness in the characters. # Difference in how the narrative is presented: telling a story or acting it out. The analysis of tragedy in the Poetics constitutes the core of the discussion.Aristotle Poetics 1447a13 (1987, 1). Although the text is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition, \\"almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions\\".Carlson (1993, 16). The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by Averroes. Background Aristotle's work on aesthetics consists of the Poetics, Politics (Bk VIII) and Rhetoric. The Poetics is specifically concerned with drama. At some point, Aristotle's original work was divided in two, each \\"book\\" written on a separate roll of papyrus.Janko (1987, xx). Only the first part - that which focuses on tragedy and epic (as a quasi-dramatic art, given its definition in Ch 23) - survives. The lost second part addressed comedy. Some scholars speculate that the Tractatus coislinianus summarises the contents of the lost second book.Janko (1987, xxi). Overview The table of contents page of the Poetics found in Modern Library's Basic Works of Aristotle (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.The Basic Works of Aristotle. Ed. Richard McKeon Modern Library (2001) ‚Äì Poetics. Trans. Ingrid Bywater, pp. 1453‚Äì87 * A. Preliminary discourse on tragedy, epic poetry, and comedy, as the chief forms of imitative poetry. * B. Definition of a tragedy, and the rules for its construction. Definition and analysis into qualitative parts. * C. Rules for the construction of a tragedy: Tragic pleasure, or catharsis experienced by fear and pity should be produced in the spectator. The characters must be four things: good, appropriate, realistic, and consistent. Discovery must occur within the plot. Narratives, stories, structures and poetics overlap. It is important for the poet to visualize all of the scenes when creating the plot. The poet should incorporate complication and d√©nouement within the story, as well as combine all of the elements of tragedy. The poet must express thought through the characters' words and actions, while paying close attention to diction and how a character's spoken words express a specific idea. Aristotle believed that all of these different elements had to be present in order for the poetry to be well-done. *D. Possible criticisms of an epic or tragedy, and the answers to them. * E. Tragedy as artistically superior to epic poetry: Tragedy has everything that the epic has, even the epic meter being admissible. The reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the play as acted. The tragic imitation requires less time for the attainment of its end. If it has more concentrated effect, it is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it. There is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets (plurality of actions) and this is proved by the fact that an epic poem can supply enough material for several tragedies. Synopsis Aristotle distinguishes between the genres of \\"poetry\\" in three ways: * Matter ::language, rhythm, and melody, for Aristotle, make up the matter of poetic creation. Where the epic poem makes use of language alone, the playing of the lyre involves rhythm and melody. Some poetic forms include a blending of all materials; for example, Greek tragic drama included a singing chorus, and so music and language were all part of the performance. These points also convey the standard view. Recent work, though, argues that translating rhuthmos here as \\"rhythm\\" is absurd: melody already has its own inherent musical rhythm, and the Greek can mean what Plato says it means in Laws II, 665a: \\"(the name of) ordered body movement,\\" or dance. This correctly conveys what dramatic musical creation, the topic of the Poetics, in ancient Greece had: music, dance, and language. Also, the musical instrument cited in Ch 1 is not the lyre but the kithara, which was played in the drama while the kithara-player was dancing (in the chorus), even if that meant just walking in an appropriate way. Moreover, epic might have had only literary exponents, but as Plato's Ion and Aristotle's Ch 26 of the Poetics help prove, for Plato and Aristotle at least some epic rhapsodes used all three means of mimesis: language, dance (as pantomimic gesture), and music (if only by chanting the words).Scott (2018b) * Subjects ::Also \\"agents\\" in some translations. Aristotle differentiates between tragedy and comedy throughout the work by distinguishing between the nature of the human characters that populate either form. Aristotle finds that tragedy deals with serious, important, and virtuous people. Comedy, on the other hand, treats of less virtuous people and focuses on human \\"weaknesses and foibles\\". Aristotle introduces here the influential tripartite division of characters in superior (Œ≤ŒµŒªœÑŒØŒøŒΩŒ±œÇ) to the audience, inferior (œáŒµŒØœÅŒøŒΩŒ±œÇ), or at the same level (œÑŒøŒπŒøœçœÑŒøœÖœÇ).Gregory Michael Sifakis (2001) Aristotle on the function of tragic poetry p. 50Aristotle, Poetics 1448a, English, original GreekNorthrop Frye (1957). Anatomy of Criticism. * Method ::One may imitate the agents through use of a narrator throughout, or only occasionally (using direct speech in parts and a narrator in parts, as Homer does), or only through direct speech (without a narrator), using actors to speak the lines directly. This latter is the method of tragedy (and comedy): without use of any narrator. Having examined briefly the field of \\"poetry\\" in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy: > Tragedy is a representation of a serious, complete action which has > magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] > separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people > acting and not by narration, accomplishing by means of pity and terror the > catharsis of such emotions. By \\"embellished speech\\", I mean that which has > rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By \\"with its elements separately\\", I mean that > some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and > others again by means of song (1449b25-30).Janko (1987, 7). In Butcher's > translation, this passage reads: \\"Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an > action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language > embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being > found in separate parts of the play, in the form of action, not of > narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper catharsis of these > emotions.\\" He then identifies the \\"parts\\" of tragedy: * plot (mythos) ::Refers to the \\"organization of incidents\\". It should imitate an action evoking pity and fear. The plot involves a change from bad towards good, or good towards bad. Complex plots have reversals and recognitions. These and suffering (or violence) are used to evoke the tragic emotions. The most tragic plot pushes a good character towards undeserved misfortune because of a mistake (hamartia). Plots revolving around such a mistake are more tragic than plots with two sides and an opposite outcome for the good and the bad. Violent situations are most tragic if they are between friends and family. Threats can be resolved (best last) by being done in knowledge, done in ignorance and then discovered, almost be done in ignorance but be discovered in the last moment. ::Actions should follow logically from the situation created by what has happened before, and from the character of the agent. This goes for recognitions and reversals as well, as even surprises are more satisfying to the audience if they afterwards are seen as a plausible or necessary consequence. * character (ethos) ::Character is the moral or ethical character of the agents. It is revealed when the agent makes moral choices. In a perfect tragedy, the character will support the plot, which means personal motivations and traits will somehow connect parts of the cause-and-effect chain of actions producing pity and fear. ::Main character should be: ::* good‚ÄîAristotle explains that audiences do not like, for example, villains \\"making fortune from misery\\" in the end. It might happen though, and might make the play interesting. Nevertheless, the moral is at stake here and morals are important to make people happy (people can, for example, see tragedy because they want to release their anger). ::* appropriate‚Äîif a character is supposed to be wise, it is unlikely he is young (supposing wisdom is gained with age). ::* consistent‚Äîif a person is a soldier, he is unlikely to be scared of blood (if this soldier is scared of blood it must be explained and play some role in the story to avoid confusing the audience); it is also \\"good\\" if a character doesn't change opinion \\"that much\\" if the play is not \\"driven\\" by who characters are, but by what they do (audience is confused in case of unexpected shifts in behaviour [and its reasons and morals] of characters). ::* \\"consistently inconsistent\\"‚Äîif a character always behaves foolishly it is strange if he suddenly becomes smart. In this case it would be good to explain such change, otherwise the audience may be confused. If character changes opinion a lot it should be clear he is a character who has this trait, not a real life person ‚Äì this is also to avoid confusion. * thought (dianoia)‚Äîspoken (usually) reasoning of human characters can explain the characters or story background. * diction (lexis) Lexis is better translated according to some as \\"speech\\" or \\"language.\\" Otherwise, the relevant necessary condition stemming from logos in the definition (language) has no followup: mythos (plot) could be done by dancers or pantomime artists, given Chs 1, 2 and 4, if the actions are structured (on stage, as drama was usually done), just like plot for us can be given in film or in a story-ballet with no words. ::Refers to the quality of speech in tragedy. Speeches should reflect character, the moral qualities of those on the stage. The expression of the meaning of the words. * melody (melos) \\"Melos\\" can also mean \\"music-dance\\" as some musicologists recognize, especially given that its primary meaning in ancient Greek is \\"limb\\" (an arm or a leg). This is arguably more sensible because then Aristotle is conveying what the chorus actually did.Scott 2019 ::The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors. It should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action. Should be contributed to the unity of the plot. It is a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama. * spectacle (opsis) ::Refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes and props (anything you can see). Aristotle calls spectacle the \\"least artistic\\" element of tragedy, and the \\"least connected with the work of the poet (playwright). For example: if the play has \\"beautiful\\" costumes and \\"bad\\" acting and \\"bad\\" story, there is \\"something wrong\\" with it. Even though that \\"beauty\\" may save the play it is \\"not a nice thing\\". He offers the earliest- surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy: > Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and > comedy‚Äîtragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the > leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in > many of our cities) [...] (1449a10-13)Janko (1987, 6). This text is > available online in an older translation, in which the same passage reads: > \\"At any rate it originated in improvisation‚Äîboth tragedy itself and comedy. > The one tragedy came from the prelude to the dithyramb and the other comedy > from the prelude to the phallic songs which still survive as institutions in > many cities.\\" Influence Ab≈´ Bishr MattƒÅ. The Arabic version of Aristotle's Poetics that influenced the Middle Ages was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated Paris 1741. The Syriac-language source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original Poetics and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages.Hardison, 81.

The Poetics begins at 184r, page 380 of the pdf. Arabic scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle's Poetics included Avicenna, Al-Farabi and Averroes. Many of these interpretations sought to use Aristotelian theory to impose morality on the Arabic poetic tradition. In particular, Averroes added a moral dimension to the Poetics by interpreting tragedy as the art of praise and comedy as the art of blame. Averroes' interpretation of the Poetics was accepted by the West, where it reflected the \\"prevailing notions of poetry\\" into the 16th century. Recent scholarship has challenged whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.\\"Aristotle on the Power of Music in Tragedy,\\" Pierre Destr√©e, Greek & Roman Musical Studies, Vol. 4, Issue 2, 2016; Gregory L.

While Britain did not ban the institution of slavery in present-day Canada (and British colonies) until 1833, the practice of slavery in Canada ended through case law; and it died out in the early 19th century through judicial actions litigated on behalf of slaves seeking manumission. The courts, to varying degrees, rendered slavery unenforceable in both Lower Canada and Nova Scotia. In Lower Canada, for example, after court decisions in the late 1790s, the \\"slave could not be compelled to serve longer than he would, and ... might leave his master at will.\\" Upper Canada passed the Act Against Slavery in 1793, one of the earliest anti-slavery acts in the world. These early measures resulted in a significant number of Black people (free and slaves) immigrating to Canada from the United States after the American Revolution and again after the War of 1812, many by way of the Underground Railroad. Historian Marcel Trudel estimates that there were fewer than 4,200 slaves in the area of Canada (New France) and later The Canadas between 1671 and 1831. The majority two- thirds of these were of indigenous ancestry (2,700 typically called panis, from the French term for Pawnee) and one-third were of African descent (1,443). They were house servants and farm workers. The number of black slaves increased during British rule, especially with the arrival of United Empire Loyalists after 1783. The Maritimes saw 1,200 to 2,000 slaves arrive prior to abolition, with 300 accounted for in Lower Canada, and between 500 and 700 in Upper Canada. A small portion of Black Canadians today are descended from these slaves. People of African descent were forcibly brought as chattel slaves to southern areas of the Americas. Those in what is now called Canada typically came from the American colonies, as no shiploads of human chattel went to Canada directly from Africa. There were no large plantations in Canada, and therefore no need for a large slave work forces of the sort that existed in most European colonies in the Americas. Nevertheless, slaves in Canada were subjected to the same physical, psychological, and sexual violence and punishments as their American counterparts. Because Canada's role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade was so minor, the history of black slavery in Canada is often overshadowed by the more tumultuous slavery practised elsewhere in the Americas, with modern human trafficking (especially with regard to indigenous women) becoming the significant legal and political issue of Canadian society. Publication No. 2011-59-E Under Indigenous rule Slavey girls, Mackenzie River, Northwest Territories (NWT). Slave-owning people of what became Canada were, for example, the fishing societies, such as the Yurok, that lived along the Pacific coast from Alaska to California, on what is sometimes described as the Pacific or Northern Northwest Coast. Some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, such as the Haida and Tlingit, were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California. Slavery was hereditary, the slaves being prisoners of war and their descendants were slaves.Kenneth M. Ames, \\"Slaves, Chiefs and Labour on the Northern Northwest Coast,\\" World Archaeology, Vol. 33, No. 1, The Archaeology of Slavery (June, 2001), pp. 1‚Äì17 in JSTOR Some nations in British Columbia continued to segregate and ostracize the descendants of slaves as late as the 1970s. Among a few Pacific Northwest nations about a quarter of the population were slaves.Haida Warfare One slave narrative was composed by an Englishman, John R. Jewitt, who had been taken alive when his ship was captured in 1802; his memoir provides a detailed look at life as a slave, and asserts that a large number were held. Under French rule According to Afua Cooper, author of \\"The Hanging of Ang√©lique: The Untold Story of Canadian Slavery and the Burning of Old Montr√©al\\", enslaved First Nations people outnumbered enslaved individuals of African descent under French rule. She attributed this to the relative ease with which New France could acquire First Nations slaves. She noted that the mortality of slaves was high, with the average age of First Nations slaves only 17, and the average age of slaves of African descent, 25. One of the first recorded black slave in Canada was brought by a British convoy to New France in 1628. Olivier le Jeune was the name given to the boy, originally from Madagascar. By 1688, New France's population was 11,562 people, made up primarily of fur traders, missionaries, and farmers settled along the St. Lawrence Valley. To help overcome its severe shortage of servants and labourers, King Louis XIV granted New France's petition to import black slaves from West Africa. Though no shipments ever arrived from Africa, colonists did acquire some black slaves from other French and British colonies. From the late 1600s, they also acquired Indigenous slaves, mostly from what is now the US Midwestern states, through their western fur-trade networks. Slaves of Indigenous origin were called \\"Panis,\\" but few came from the Pawnee tribe. More commonly, they were of Fox, Dakota, Iowa and Apache origin, captives taken in war by French Indigenous allies and trading partners. Code Noir of 1742, Nantes history museum While slavery was prohibited in France, it was permitted in its colonies as a means of providing the massive labour force needed to clear land, construct buildings and (in the Caribbean colonies) work on sugar, indigo and tobacco plantations. The 1685 Code Noir set the pattern for policing slavery in the West Indies. It required that all slaves be instructed as Catholics and not as Protestants. It concentrated on defining the condition of slavery, and established harsh controls. Slaves had virtually no rights, though the Code did enjoin masters to take care of the sick and old. The code noir does not seem to have applied to Canada and so, in 1709, the intendant Jacques Raudot issued an ordinance officially recognizing slavery in New France; slavery existed before that date, but only as of 1709 was it instituted in law. Marie-Joseph Ang√©lique was the black slave of a rich widow in Montreal. According to a published account of her life,Cooper (2006) by Afua Cooper in 1734, after learning that she was going to be sold and separated from her lover, she set fire to her owner's house and escaped. The fire raged out of control, destroying forty-six buildings. Captured two months later, Marie-Joseph was paraded through the city, then tortured until she confessed her crime. In the afternoon of the day of execution, Ang√©lique was taken through the streets of Montreal and, after the stop at the church for her amende honorable, made to climb a scaffold facing the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the fire. There she was hanged until dead, with her body flung into the fire and the ashes scattered in the wind. Historian Marcel Trudel recorded approximately 4000 slaves by the end of New France in 1759, of which 2,472 were Aboriginal people, and 1,132 Blacks. After the Conquest of New France by the British, slave ownership remained dominated by the French. Marcel Trudel identified 1,509 slave owners, of which only 181 were English. Trudel also noted 31 marriages took place between French colonists and Aboriginal slaves. Under British rule First Nations owned or traded in slaves, an institution that had existed for centuries or longer among certain groups. Shawnee, Potawatomi, and other western tribes imported slaves from Ohio and Kentucky and sold or gifted them to allies and Canadian settlers. Chief Thayendenaga (a.k.a.Joseph Brant) used blacks he had captured during the American Revolution to build Brant House at Burlington Beach and a second home near Brantford. In all, Brant owned about forty black slaves.Derreck (2003) Black slaves lived in the British regions of Canada in the 17th and 18th centuries‚Äî104 were listed in a 1767 census of Nova Scotia, but their numbers were small until the United Empire Loyalist influx after 1783. As white Loyalists fled the new American Republic, they took with them about 2,000 black slaves: 1,200 to the Maritimes (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island), 300 to Lower Canada (Quebec), and 500 to Upper Canada (Ontario). In Ontario, the Imperial Act of 1790 assured prospective immigrants that their slaves would remain their property. As under French rule, Loyalist slaves were held in small numbers and were employed as domestic servants, farm hands, and skilled artisans. The subject of slavery in Canada is unmentioned‚Äîneither banned nor permitted‚Äîin both the 1763 Treaty of Paris and the Quebec Act of 1774 or the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The system of gang labour, and its consequent institutions of control and brutality, did not develop in Canada as it did in the USA. Because they did not appear to pose a threat to their masters, slaves were permitted to learn to read and write, Christian conversion was encouraged, and their marriages were recognized by law. Death rates among slaves were nevertheless high, confirming the brutal nature of the slave regime.Trudel (2004) The Quebec Gazette of 12 July 1787 had an advertisement: :For sale, a robust Negress, active and with good hearing, about 18 years old, who has had small-pox, has been accustomed to household duties, understands the kitchen, knows how to wash, iron, sew, and very used to caring for children. She can adapt itself equally to an English, French or German family, she speaks all three languages.W.H. Kesterton, A history of journalism in Canada. (McClelland and Stewart, 1967) p 7 Abolition movement =Lower Canada (Quebec)= In Lower Canada, Sir James Monk, the Chief Justice, rendered a series of decisions in the late 1790s that undermined the ability to compel slaves to serve their masters; while \\"not technically abolishing slavery, [they] rendered it innocuous.\\" As a result, slaves began to flee their masters within the province, but also from other provinces and from the United States. This occurred several years before the legislature acted in Upper Canada to limit slavery. While the decision was founded upon a technicality (the extant law allowing committal of slaves not to jails, but only to houses of correction, of which there were none in the province), Monk went on to say that \\"slavery did not exist in the province and to warn owners that he would apply this interpretation of the law to all subsequent cases.\\" In subsequent decisions, and in the absence of specific legislation, Monk's interpretation held (even once there had been houses of correction established). In a later test of this interpretation, the administrator of Lower Canada, Sir James Kempt, refused in 1829 a request from the U.S. government to return an escaped slave, informing that fugitives might be given up only when the crime in question was also a crime in Lower Canada: \\"The state of slavery is not recognized by the Law of Canada. ... Every Slave therefore who comes into the Province is immediately free whether he has been brought in by violence or has entered it of his own accord.\\" =Nova Scotia= Monument to abolitionist James Drummond MacGregor ‚Äì helped free Black Nova Scotian slaves While many black people who arrived in Nova Scotia during the American Revolution were free, others were not. Some blacks arrived in Nova Scotia as the property of white American Loyalists. In 1772, prior to the American Revolution, Britain outlawed the slave trade in the British Isles followed by the Knight v. Wedderburn decision in Scotland in 1778. This decision, in turn, influenced the colony of Nova Scotia. In 1788, abolitionist James Drummond MacGregor from Pictou published the first anti-slavery literature in Canada and began purchasing slaves' freedom and chastising his colleagues in the Presbyterian church who owned slaves. Historian Alan Wilson describes the document as \\"a landmark on the road to personal freedom in province and country\\".Alan Wilson. Highland Shepherd: James MacGregor, Father of the Scottish Enlightenment in Nova Scotia. University of Toronto Press, 2015, p. 75 Historian Robin Winks writes it is \\"the sharpest attack to come from a Canadian pen even into the 1840s; he had also brought about a public debate which soon reached the courts\\".Robin Winks as cited by Alan Wilson. Highland Shepherd: James MacGregor, Father of the Scottish Enlightenment in Nova Scotia. University of Toronto Press, 2015, p. 79 (Abolitionist lawyer Benjamin Kent was buried in Halifax in 1788.) In 1790 John Burbidge freed his slaves. Led by Richard John Uniacke, in 1787, 1789 and again on 11 January 1808 the Nova Scotian legislature refused to legalize slavery.Bridglal Pachai & Henry Bishop.

Black Refugees. p. 31 Two chief justices, Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange (1790‚Äì1796) and Sampson Salter Blowers (1797‚Äì1832), were instrumental in freeing slaves from their owners in Nova Scotia.Barry Cahill. Slavery and the Judges of Loyalist Nova Scotia. UNB Law Journal, 43 (1994) pp. 73‚Äì135 They were held in high regard in the colony. Justice Alexander Croke (1801‚Äì1815) also impounded American slave ships during this time period (the most famous being the Liverpool Packet). During the war, Nova Scotian Sir William Winniett served as a crew on board HMS Tonnant in the effort to free slaves from America. (As the Governor of the Gold Coast, Winniett would later also work to end the slave trade in Western Africa.) By the end of the War of 1812 and the arrival of the Black Refugees, there were few slaves left in Nova ScotiaOpinions of several gentlemen of the law, on the subject of negro servitude, in the province of Nova-Scotia. 1802. (The Slave Trade Act outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807 and the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 outlawed slavery altogether.) The Sierra Leone Company was established to relocate groups of formerly enslaved Africans, nearly 1,200 black Nova Scotians, most of whom had escaped enslavement in the United States. Given the coastal environment of Nova Scotia, many had died from the harsh winters. They created a settlement in the existing colony in Sierra Leone (already established to make a home for the \\"poor blacks\\" of London) at Freetown in 1792. Many of the \\"black poor\\" included other African and Asian inhabitants of London. The Freetown settlement was joined, particularly after 1834, by other groups of freed Africans and became the first African-American haven in Africa for formerly enslaved Africans. =Upper Canada (Ontario)= By 1790 the abolition movement was gaining credence in Canada and the ill intent of slavery was evidenced by an incident involving a slave woman being violently abused by her slave owner on her way to being sold in the United States. In 1793 Chloe Cooley, in an act of defiance yelled out screams of resistance. The abuse committed by her slave owner and her violent resistance was witnessed by Peter Martin and William Grisely.Archives of Ontario,\\"Enslaved Africans in Upper Canada\\" Peter Martin, a former slave, brought the incident to the attention of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. Under the auspices of Simcoe, the Act Against Slavery of 1793 was legislated. The elected members of the executive council, many of whom were merchants or farmers who depended on slave labour, saw no need for emancipation. Attorney-General John White later wrote that there was \\"much opposition but little argument\\" to his measure. Finally the Assembly passed the Act Against Slavery that legislated the gradual abolition of slavery: no slaves could be imported; slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at age 25. To discourage manumission, the Act required the master to provide security that the former slave would not become a public charge. The compromise Act Against Slavery stands as the only attempt by any Ontario legislature to act against slavery.Patrick Bode, \\"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves\\". Beaver 1993 73(3): 17‚Äì19 This legal rule ensured the eventual end of slavery in Upper Canada, although as it diminished the sale value of slaves within the province it also resulted in slaves being sold to the United States. In 1798 there was an attempt by lobby groups to rectify the legislation and import more slaves.Patrick Bode, \\"Simcoe and the Slaves\\", The Beaver 73. 3 (June‚ÄìJuly 1993) Slaves discovered they could gain freedom by escaping to Ohio and Michigan in the United States.Afua Cooper, \\"Acts of Resistance: Black Men and Women Engage Slavery in Upper Canada, 1793-1803\\" Ontario History (Spring 2007) 99#1 pp 5-17. By 1800 the other provinces of British North America had effectively limited slavery through court decisions requiring the strictest proof of ownership, which was rarely available. In 1819, John Robinson, Attorney General of Upper Canada, declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would protect their freedom. Slavery remained legal, however, until the British Parliament's Slavery Abolition Act finally abolished slavery in most parts of the British Empire effective 1 August 1834. Today there are four surviving slave cemeteries in Canada: in St-Armand, Quebec, Shelburne, Nova Scotia and Priceville and Dresden in Ontario. =Underground Railroad= International Underground Railroad Memorial in Windsor, Ontario Around the time of the Emancipation, the Underground Railroad network was established in the United States, particularly Ohio, where slaves would cross into the Northern States over the Ohio River and into Canada across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, en route to various settlements and towns in Upper Canada (known as Canada West from 1841 to 1867, now Ontario). This is Canada's only relationship to slavery generally known to the public or acknowledged by the Canadian government. In Nova Scotia, former slave Richard Preston established the African Abolition Society in the fight to end slavery in America. Preston was trained as a minister in England and met many of the leading voices in the abolitionist movement that helped to get the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British Parliament in 1833. When Preston returned to Nova Scotia, he became the president of the Abolitionist movement in Halifax. Preston stated: :The time will come when slavery will be just one of our many travails. Our children and their children‚Äôs children will mature to become indifferent toward climate and indifferent toward race. Then we will desire ... Nay!, we will demand and we will be able to obtain our fair share of wealth, status and prestige, including political power. Our time will have come, and we will be ready ... we must be. Modern slavery Slavery ended with the ratifying of the Slavery Convention in 1953. Human trafficking in Canada has become a significant legal and political issue, and Canadian legislators have been criticized for having failed to deal with the problem in a more systematic way. British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons formed in 2007, making British Columbia the first province of Canada to address human trafficking in a formal manner. The biggest human trafficking case in Canadian history surrounded the dismantling of the Domotor-Kolompar criminal organization. On June 6, 2012, the Government of Canada established the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking in order to oppose human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Taskforce was established in June 2012 to replace the Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons as the body responsible for the development of public policy related to human trafficking in Canada. One current and highly publicized instance is the vast \\"disappearances\\" of Aboriginal women which has been linked to human trafficking by some sources. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper had been reluctant to tackle the issue on the grounds that it is not a \\"sociological issue\\" and declined to create a national inquiry into the issue counter to United Nations and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights' opinions that the issue is significant and in need of higher inquiry.

He was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the most prestigious award for gallantry in combat that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.  Early life  He was born in Barrackpore, India, the son of Dr. John Browne, a surgeon of the Bengal Medical Service and his wife Charlotte (n√©e Swinton). Browne joined the 46th Bengal Native Infantry as a subaltern, participating in action at Ramnuggar, Sadoolapore, Chillianwalla and Gujrat. In 1849 he was made a lieutenant and tasked with raising a cavalry force, to be designated the 2nd Punjab Irregular Cavalry and later incorporated into the regular force. He would command this unit for the next five years. Later (1904) the unit would be re-designated as the 22nd Sam Browne's Cavalry (Frontier Force) in his honour.  Indian Mutiny  Browne commanded the 2nd Punjab in several engagements, and was decorated for action during the Bozdar Expedition of 1857, being promoted to captain. Browne was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 31 August 1858 at Seerporah, Rohilkhand, Uttar Pradesh, India. His citation reads: His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum.  Sam Browne belt  \\"Ape\\", published in Vanity Fair, 5 February 1887 Sometime after this incident he began to wear the accoutrement which bears his name, as compensation for the difficulty his disability caused with wearing his officer's sword. A Sam Browne belt is a wide belt, usually leather, supported by a narrower strap passing diagonally over the right shoulder; the diagonal strap stabilizes the scabbard of a sword if worn. Later such a belt would be adopted by other officers who knew Browne in India, but it was not to become used commonly by the British Army until after his retirement. Browne's original \\"Sam Browne\\" belt is possessed presently by the National Army Museum in Chelsea.  Later life  Browne retired from the army in 1898, relocated to Ryde on the Isle of Wight, England, and died there at the age of 76. His remains were cremated but there is a memorial marker dedicated to Browne in the Ryde New Cemetery, as well as plaques at St Paul's Cathedral in London and Lahore Cathedral in Pakistan. His grave was restored in 2010.

Pershing wearing a Sam Browne belt The Sam Browne belt is a wide belt, usually leather, supported by a narrower strap passing diagonally over the right shoulder (although Royal Canadian Mounted Police non-commissioned members wear theirs over the left shoulder). It is most often a part of a military or police uniform. Origins Sam Browne missing his left arm and beltless in a full dress uniform with sash Irish Army Ceremonial party in service dress with Sam Browne Belt Polish chief of staff Gen. Mieczys≈Çaw Cieniuch wearing a Sam Browne belt as part of the winter officer's uniform General Sir Sam Browne was a 19th-century British Indian Army officer who had lost his left arm to a sword cut during the Sepoy Rebellion; this made it difficult for him to draw his sword, because the left hand was typically used to steady the scabbard while the right drew out the sword. Browne came up with the idea of wearing a second belt which went over his right shoulder to hold the scabbard steady. This would hook into a waist belt with D-rings for attaching accessories. It also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on his right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other officers began wearing a similar rig and eventually it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, it was copied by other troops and eventually became standard issue. Infantry officers wore a variant that used two suspender-like straps instead of the cross-belt. It was supposedly invented in 1878 by Lieutenant Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery, of the 60th Rifles, while serving in India. Use Due to its former use as equipment for carrying a sword, it was traditionally only worn by those to whom a sword would historically have been issued, namely commissioned officers and warrant officers. Lieutenant-General Hugo √ñsterman, a Finnish general wearing the Sam Browne belt during World War II =Finland= In the Finnish Army (as well as in Finnish Air Force) the Sam Browne belt, officially known as a \\"command belt\\" or \\"officer belt\\", has been used by officers and senior NCOs as well as officer cadets when wearing service, dress or parade uniforms. Currently it is mainly used by high-ranking officers during parades and other ceremonies, as it is only worn with dress uniform M58 and service uniform M83; while most Army and Air Force personnel, excluding cadets studying in the National Defence College as well as soldiers on ceremonial duties, use the camouflage uniform M05 as their service uniform, and the use of the \\"command belt\\" with any camouflage uniform except M62 (already phased out of service) is strictly forbidden. =Germany= Mussolini and Hitler wearing the belt The Sam Browne belt featured prominently in many uniforms used by the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, again in imitation of earlier European uniforms. It was popular with Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazi officials. =Ireland= The Irish Citizen Army, Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army (IRA) made extensive use of Sam Browne belts during the Irish revolutionary period (1916‚Äì23). This included women serving with the Irish Citizen Army, among them Constance Markievicz. The folk song \\"The Broad Black Brimmer\\" also mentions the Sam Browne belt. They were later used by the Garda S√≠och√°na and the National Army. =United Kingdom and the Commonwealth= In the 20th century it was a mainstay in the British Army officers' corps, being adopted service-wide in 1900 during the Second Boer War after limited use in India, and later becoming popular with military forces throughout the Commonwealth. After World War II the Sam Browne belt saw a decline in use in the Commonwealth. It was dropped from the standard officer's uniform in 1943 and replaced by the cloth P37 and P44 web gear. However, officers and warrant officers class 1 of the British Army and Royal Marines still wear it in service (No.2) dress and in non- ceremonial versions of No.1 dress.Paragraph 20, Dress Regulations for the Mercian Regiment, January 2009 It was phased out by the Canadian military beginning with the unification of the armed services in 1968.Lieutenant C.M. Stevens, Seaforth Highlanders of Canada In Australia, all officers and warrant officers class 1 are entitled to wear the belt in ceremonial dress. Within the corps of the Australian Army there is some variation, with members of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps and Australian Army Aviation Corps wearing black Sam Browne belts. Rifle belt Bullet belt A different arrangement, supposedly invented in 1878 by Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery of the 60th Rifles while serving in India, consists of a similar wide belt with two vertical supporting straps, one over each shoulder. This design puts the burden of the gear, with its heavy ammo pouches on the belt and straps, on both shoulders. It was worn by the officers of British and Commonwealth rifle regiments, who had to carry a rifle as their service arm rather than a pistol. It was also worn by big game hunters in Africa and India in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. It is often seen worn in movies or TV shows as part of the costume of explorers or big game hunters. = United States = During World War I, the Sam Browne Belt was approved by General Pershing, commander of the AEF, for wear by American officers as a rank distinction. However, the Army as a whole did not immediately approve its use. MPs were positioned at stateside docks and confiscated them from returning officers. The United States Army mandated the Sam Browne belt for overseas soldiers in 1918 under the name \\"Liberty belt\\" and for all service members in 1921, this time under the internationally accepted name \\"Sam Browne belt\\". It was a standard part of the uniform between World War I and World War II. It was limited in use in 1940 when the Army abandoned sabers and replaced with a cloth waistbelt that was sewn to the officer's jacket. During World War I the Marine Corps adopted a brown leather Sam Browne Belt. It was later changed to black, the official color of Navy and Marine Corps leather gear. It is worn as part of the dress Blue A & B, Blue- white dress, and service A uniform by sword-bearing commissioned and warrant officers. After the First World War, Sam Browne belts \\"become almost universal among American police\\". The utility belts worn today by American police usually lack the cross-strap and the attachments for them. The belt fastens in the same way, with the bar of the buckle engaging a pair of hooks and the end of the belt retained by a post and keeper loop. They are also frequently fully lined, as opposed to the old style half-linings, to support equipment the length of the belt. =Use in police forces worldwide= The Sam Browne belt is largely obsolete in police and security use due to risk of strangulation by potential opponents. It has sometimes been referred to as a Suicide Belt by personnel. It had enjoyed some popularity with civilian police agencies worldwide and was probably most widely worn in this context during the 1940s and 1950s. This use has gradually faded out due to field safety concerns. It is part of the ceremonial dress uniform of many agencies, most notably the Red Serge worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP enlisted ranks wear the cross belt over the left shoulder to support the pistol worn on the right side. Enlisted members who are left handed wear the cross strap over the right shoulder to support the pistol worn on the left side. RCMP commissioned officers wear the cross strap over the right shoulder due to the need to support a sword when wearing the red serge ceremonial uniform. This difference of wearing the cross strap over different shoulders for commissioned and non- commissioned members is even maintained when wearing the stripped Sam Browne belt (no pistol or sword). Safety The Sam Browne belt has been proposed as a solution to occupational safety and health concerns about injury due to the weight of equipment on police officers' belts. However, others have expressed concern that the vertical design of the belt could enable criminals to gain physical control of law enforcement officers in an altercation. Civilian use Big Boss Man (Wrestler) wearing a Sam Browne belt During the interwar period, the belt became fashionable among some American and European women. Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady of the United States at the time, openly spoke out against the practice. The belts also became a symbol of civilian authority by \\"everybody from bus drivers to volunteer schoolboy traffic cops\\". The belt's use by junior safety patrol members is archetypal.Bill Lohmann Times-Dispatch, Staff Writer. \\"Aaa Safety Patrols * 1920-1995 75 Years of Safety Now as then, Kids in the Sam Browne Belts Stand between their Schoolmates and Danger.\\" Richmond Times - Dispatch, Sep 20, 1995.\\"Helping to Keep Schools Safe.\\" Times - News, Aug 14, 2009. Since the 1970s, the use of Sam Browne Belts has increased in popularity within the Queer BDSM Leather subculture. Reflective Sam Browne belts are a popular safety device among cyclists for increasing their visibility, and a bright orange version is often worn by school crossing guards in junior safety patrols.

It is colloquially known as the \\"second city\\" of O ªahu, in relation to Honolulu. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Kapolei as a census-designated place (CDP) within the consolidated city-county of Honolulu. The community takes its name from a volcanic cone, Pu ªu o Kapolei. In the Hawaiian language, pu ªu means \\"hill\\" and Kapo lei means \\"beloved Kapo\\". According to legend, Kapo, Goddess of Fertility was sister to Pele, Goddess of Fire and NƒÅmaka, Goddess of the Sea. Much of the land is part of the estate of industrialist James Campbell. Kapolei's major developer is Kapolei Property Development, a subsidiary of James Campbell Company. Kapolei sits primarily upon former sugarcane and pineapple fields. History Kapolei Urban Design Plan In 1955 the Kapolei master plan was drafted and revised 3 different times beginning in 1974. In 1977 the new General Provision Plan adopted the O ªahu General Plan which dubbed Kapolei \\"second urban center\\" (SUC) on the island of O ªahu. In 1986 the  ªEwa Master Plan was revised to include the SUC and the initial residential construction in the Kapolei area began in the late 1980s with commercial developments springing up shortly thereafter. Nearly two decades later, in 2006 the Kapolei area had more than 800 companies, agencies, and organizations making up approximately 25,000 jobs. As of the 2010 census, the Kapolei CDP had a population of 15,186 people. The original development objectives for the City of Kapolei were to include: an employment center, a new center for offices and businesses, a center for government offices, a city of people walking, biking, or bussing, the latest energy-efficient technologies such as water conservation and recycling, and the most efficient connectivity for commuting on O ªahu. In essence a \\"smart city\\". The design plan for development ensures that the 7 themes of Kapolei remain the same throughout its construction. These include 1. Hawaiian Garden City 2. Healthy Living 3. Complete Community Services 4. Pedestrian-friendly 5. Past/Present/Future design architecture 6. Sustainability 7. Technology. Kapolei is quickly becoming the second urban center of O ªahu, Hawai ªi's most densely populated island. Much of O ªahu's future population growth is projected for the Kapolei area,  ªEwa Plain, and southern slopes of the island's central valley, between Waipahu near Pearl Harbor and WahiawƒÅ near the island's center. The U.S. postal code for Kapolei is 96707. In 2002, Pacific Business News reported that 96707 had the second highest median income on the island of O ªahu, at $62,303. Sperlings's Best Places reports Kapolei's median income of $70,129, compared to the national average of $42,350. Nearly one household in five has income exceeding $100,000, with a home ownership rate of 70%.  Communities  Other communities in the Kapolei area are the census-designated places of Makakilo and Naval Air Station Barbers Point (now known as Kalaeloa), the industrial area known as Campbell Industrial Park with the state's second largest deepwater port, Barbers Point Harbor, and the resort and marina community of Ko Olina, which includes the Disney Aulani Resort and Ko Olina Golf Club. Transportation Ongoing road construction has not resolved continuing traffic problems. A Manawai Street-Kama‚Äòaha Avenue extension was completed in August 2006 and helped to reduce congestion along Kamokila Boulevard and Farrington Highway. Kapolei Property Development began construction in January 2007 on a $2 million road to extend Kamokila Boulevard from Kapolei Parkway to Roosevelt Avenue. Kapolei Property Development recently contributed $6 million for a joint project with the State Department of Transportation for an additional freeway on-ramp. Although state and county governments and some of Hawai ªi's largest companies have significant workplaces in Kapolei, population growth has far out-paced local job creation. A majority of Kapolei adults work in Honolulu, congesting the main traffic artery, Interstate H-1. In December 2006, the Honolulu City Council approved a fixed-guideway elevated rail system connecting Kapolei to Downtown Honolulu. In January 2007, O ªahu residents saw an increase of 0.5 percent to the general excise tax to help cover the costs of construction of the system. The project broke ground in East Kapolei on February 22, 2011. Work on the foundations for the concrete pillars began shortly after in Waipahu; work to install the pillars started in East Kapolei in April 2012, and the first phase of the project is expected to start service to Aloha Stadium in late 2020.

Main roads Kapolei is located at the southern end of the slopes of the Wai ªanae mountain near the neighborhood of Makakilo with Fort Barrette Road, located along and named for historically important Fort Barrette, connecting Makakilo to Kapolei. It is located on the  ªEwa Plain approximately from Honolulu. The Interstate H-1 freeway divides more recently developed Kapolei from Makakilo, and traveling eastward on H-1 connects to Waipahu. In the other direction, the freeway ends about west of Kapolei, merging into Farrington Highway (State Route 93) to Kahe and then to NƒÅnƒÅkuli on the Wai‚Äòanae Coast. Traveling eastward on Farrington Highway connects to Honouliuli. Exit 1 on H-1 is Kalaeloa Boulevard, the entrance to Barbers Point and Campbell Industrial Park. Less than 1 mile beyond (west of) the merge of H-1 and Farrington Highway is an off-ramp and overcrossing to the West O ªahu resort area of Ko Olina. To the south, Renton Road connects Kapolei to Kalaeloa and, further east, to  ªEwa Villages. Government and infrastructure Kapolei is officially governed by the government of Honolulu County. The county government covers the entire island of O ªahu, with the county seat being at Honolulu Hale in Honolulu. The governmental body includes the Mayor of Honolulu County, the Honolulu City and County Council, and state representatives. Kapolei Hale, built in 2001, serves as the civic center and main municipal building of the City of Kapolei. The building contains an office for the Mayor, as well as offices of various city and county government agencies and is the headquarters for the City and County of Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation. However, the Permits Office for the Department of Parks and Recreation is located downtown Honolulu at the Frank F. Fasi Civic Center in the Frank F. Fasi Municipal Building at 650 South King Street. Additionally, federal, several state, and county department offices have been relocated to the Kapolei area.

Marshall and Robin Warren showed that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) plays a major role in causing many peptic ulcers, challenging decades of medical doctrine holding that ulcers were caused primarily by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. This discovery has allowed for a breakthrough in understanding a causative link between Helicobacter pylori infection and stomach cancer. Education and early life Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of eight. His father held various jobs, and his mother was a nurse. He is the eldest of four siblings. He attended Newman College for his secondary education and the University of Western Australia School of Medicine, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1974. He married his wife Adrienne in 1972 and has four children. In 1972 he was also a state yo-yo champion. Career and research In 1979, Marshall was appointed as a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. He met Robin Warren, a pathologist interested in gastritis, during internal medicine fellowship training at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together, the pair studied the presence of spiral bacteria in association with gastritis. In 1982, they performed the initial culture of H. pylori and developed their hypothesis related to the bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. It has been claimed that the H. pylori theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach. Marshall was quoted as saying in 1998 that \\"everyone was against me, but I knew I was right.\\" On the other hand, it has also been argued that medical researchers showed a proper degree of scientific scepticism until the H. pylori hypothesis could be supported by evidence. In 1982 Marshall and Warren obtained funding for one year of research. The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday. In this sample, they discovered the presence of H. pylori. It turns out that H. pylori grow more slowly than 2 days, and also that the stomach cultures are not contaminated by other organisms.Seeing What Others Don't, chapter 4, by Gary Klein In 1983 they submitted their findings so far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia, but the reviewers turned their paper down, rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received in 1983. After failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, Marshall, after having a baseline endoscopy done, drank a broth containing cultured H. pylori, expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer. He was surprised when, only three days later, he developed vague nausea and halitosis (due to the achlorhydria, there was no acid to kill bacteria in the stomach, and their waste products manifested as bad breath), noticed only by his mother. On days 5‚Äì8, he developed achlorhydric (no acid) vomiting. On day eight, he had a repeat endoscopy, which showed massive inflammation (gastritis), and a biopsy from which H. pylori was cultured, showing it had colonised his stomach. On the fourteenth day after ingestion, a third endoscopy was done, and Marshall began to take antibiotics.This story is related by Marshall in his Nobel acceptance lecture 8 December 2005, available for viewing on the Nobel website. Marshall did not develop antibodies to H. pylori, suggesting that innate immunity can sometimes eradicate acute H. pylori infection. Marshall's illness and recovery, based on a culture of organisms extracted from a patient, fulfilled Koch's postulates for H. pylori and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal. After his work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985‚Äì86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986‚Äìpresent), before returning to Australia while remaining on the faculty of the University of Virginia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia (UWA) from 1998‚Äì2003. Marshall continues research related to H. pylori and runs the H. pylori Research Laboratory at UWA.

In August 2020 Barry Marshall, along with Simon J. Thorpe, accepted a position at the scientific advisory board of Brainchip INC, a computer chip company.https://brainchipinc.com/wp- content/uploads/2020/08/June-Quarter-Update-2-August-2020-2.pdf Awards and honours In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Marshall and Robin Warren, his long-time collaborator, \\"for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease\\". Marshall also received the Warren Alpert Prize in 1994; the Australian Medical Association Award and the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1995; the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1996; the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1997; the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, the Dr A.H. Heineken Prize for Medicine, the Florey Medal, and the Buchanan Medal of the Royal Society in 1998. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1999. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: > Barry Marshall, together with Robin Warren, discovered spiral bacteria in > the stomachs of almost all patients with active chronic gastritis, or > duodenal or gastric ulcers, and proposed that the bacteria were an important > factor in the aetiology of these diseases. In 1985, Marshall showed by self- > administration that this bacterium, now called Helicobacter pylori, causes > acute gastritis and suggested that chronic colonisation directly leads to > peptic ulceration. These results were a major challenge to the prevailing > view that gastric disorders had a physiological basis, rather than being > infectious diseases. Marshall showed that antibiotic and bismuth salt > regimens that killed H. pylori resulted in the cure of duodenal ulcers. The > view that gastric disorders are infectious diseases is now firmly > established and there is increasing evidence for a role of H. pylori > infection in gastric cancers. The work of Marshall has produced one of the > most radical and important changes in medical perception in the last 50 > years. Barry Marshall was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical > Science in 1995 and the Buchanan Medal in 1998. Marshall was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Life Sciences in 1999; the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2002; and the Australian Centenary Medal and Macfarlane Burnet Medal and Lecture in 2003. Marshall was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Oxford in 2009. Marshall was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences (FAHMS) in 2015.

The specific conspicillata is from Latin conspicillum, a place to look from, equivalent to \\"spectacled\\". It breeds in north west Africa, southwest Europe from Iberia to Italy, and then further east on the eastern Mediterranean islands and coastal regions. It is mainly resident in Africa, but other populations migrate to winter in more widely in north and west Africa and Egypt. This bird is a rare vagrant to northern and western Europe. It also occurs in some Atlantic islands. The subspecies orbitalis has been proposed for those of the Cape Verde Islands. The presumed subspecies for the Madeira birds, bella is today usually included in this taxon, as are the birds of the Canary Islands, where the species is quite common except on El Hierro and known as zarzalero y ratonero.√Ålamo Tav√≠o, Manuel (1975): \\"Aves de Fuerteventura en peligro de extinci√≥n\\".

These are very small \\"warblers\\" and are intermediate between whitethroats and Tristram's warbler in coloration. Spectacled warblers are brown above and buff below, with chestnut wing patches and a white throat. Adult males have a grey head and the white eye ring which gives the species its name. Immature birds can be confused with both the whitethroat and the subalpine warbler, and identification is difficult in the field. The song is a fast high warble. About the precise relationships of this bird, not much can be said with certainty. It seems though as if its intermediate appearance, apart from the autapomorphic white eye ring, indicates its relationships reasonably well. It is not the closest living relative of at least Tristram's warbler though.Helbig, A. J. (2001): Phylogeny and biogeography of the genus Sylvia. In: Shirihai, Hadoram: Sylvia warblers: 24-29.

He played his entire NPB career with the Yokohama Taiyo Whales / Yokohama BayStars (1990‚Äì1999; 2004‚Äì2005). Sasaki played his entire MLB career with the Seattle Mariners (2000‚Äì2003). Professional career After playing college baseball for Tohoku Fukushi University, Sasaki was drafted with the seventh pick in the first round of the 1989 draft by the Yokohama Taiy≈ç Whales (now named Yokohama DeNA BayStars) in Japan's Central League. He played for them from 1990‚Äì1999, before joining the Seattle Mariners in 2000. He joined a bullpen that had been one of the worst in the Major Leagues, and during his rookie year won the closer job from a floundering Jos√© Mesa. Sasaki's out pitch, a devastating split-fingered fastball that drops when arriving at home plate, was nicknamed \\"The Fang\\" by Mariners radio announcers. He complemented it with a four-seam fastball that topped out at mid-90s. Sasaki maintained a rigorous throwing program, sometimes at odds with club management, that saw him throw up to 100 pitches following games in which he did not appear. Sasaki's transition to American baseball began with his being named American League Rookie of the Year. For three years, along with Jeff Nelson and Arthur Rhodes, Sasaki was an integral member of the back of Seattle's bullpen. He decided to leave the Mariners before the last year of his contract in 2004, giving up $8.5 million, citing his desire to be with his family in Japan. According to the Seattle Post- Intelligencer, however, Sasaki's real reason for returning to Japan was pressure from ownership, due to his \\"indiscreet philandering\\". Sasaki resumed his career with the BayStars upon returning to Japan, where he pitched for another year. But in his second year back, nagging knee and elbow injuries resulted in his release from Yokohama and subsequent retirement. His last official appearance came as a cameo against the Tokyo Giants on August 9, 2005, as he struck out his longtime friend and rival Kazuhiro Kiyohara in a game played at Fullcast Stadium Miyagi in his hometown. In addition to his Rookie of the Year award, Sasaki set several Japanese professional baseball records, including saves (45) and save opportunities (46) for a single season in 1998; he was twice selected to play in the All-Star game, and was selected to eight All-Star teams in Japan. Sasaki's 37 saves in his rookie season with the Seattle Mariners remained a Major League Baseball record for saves by a rookie until Neftal√≠ Feliz broke it in 2010 with 40. Personal life In 1991, Sasaki married former idol singer Kaori Shimizu. Together they had two children. After returning to Japan in 2005, Sasaki continued his affair with actress Kanako Enomoto, who was 13 years his junior. When Enomoto became pregnant, Shimizu divorced Sasaki on March 18, 2005. Enomoto gave birth prematurely on April 29, 2005.http://mdn.mainichi- msn.co.jp/waiwai/face/archive/news/2005/20050603p2g00m0dm002000c.html Sasaki's interest in sports extend outside baseball. In 2002 and 2003, he lent his name to Formula Nippon, an auto racing series in Japan. His Team 22 won two races in that time. Also is a horse racing owner, his horse Vivlos won the 2017G1 Dubai Turf race on Dubai World Cup Night and Cheval Grand winner of the prestigious G1 Japan Cup. He is currently the general representative of D'Station Racing in Super GT series. Sasaki has appeared as a judge on the Iron Chef television program. He had a side recording career, with an album of his vocals over techno beats. Sasaki chose 22 for his uniform number because he was born at 2:22 on February 22 (2/22). The BayStars have permanently honored his number.

It was recovered by English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in 1849 (in fragmentary form) in the ruined Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh (Mosul, Iraq). A form of the myth was first published by English Assyriologist George Smith in 1876; active research and further excavations led to near completion of the texts and improved translation. The En√ªma Eli≈° has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets, each holding between 115 and 170 lines of Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform script. Most of Tablet V has never been recovered, but, aside from this lacuna, the text is almost complete. This epic is one of the most important sources revealing the Babylonian worldview. Over the seven tablets, it describes the creation of the world, a battle between gods focused on the supremacy of Marduk, the creation of man destined for the service of the Mesopotamian deities, and it ends with a long passage praising Marduk. Its primary original purpose is unknown, although a version is known to have been used for certain festivals. There may also have been a political element to the myth, centered on the legitimization or primacy of Mesopotamia over Assyria. Some later versions replace Marduk with the Assyrian primary god Ashur. The En√ªma Eli≈° exists in various copies from Babylon and Assyria. The version from the archaeological Library of Ashurbanipal dates to the 7th century BCE. The composition of the text probably dates to the late 2nd millennium BCE, or even earlier, to the time of Hammurabi during the Old Babylonian Period (1900‚Äì1600 BCE). Some elements of the myth are attested by illustrations that date to, at least, as early as the Kassite era (roughly 16th‚Äì12th centuries BCE).  Background and discovery  Before the tablets were discovered, substantial elements of the myth had survived via the writings of Berossus, a 3rd-century BCE Babylonian writer and priest of Bel (Marduk). These were preserved in Alexander Polyhistor's book on Chaldean History, which was reproduced by Eusebius in Book 1 of his Chronicon. In it are described the primeval state of an abyssal darkness and water, the two primeval beings existing therein, said to be of a twofold principle. The description then relates the creation of further beings, partly human but with variants of wings, animal heads and bodies, and some with both sex organs. (Berossus states images of these are to be found at the temple of Bel in Babylon.) The text also describes a female being leading over them, named as Omoroca (Chaldean: Thalatth), and her slaying by Bel, who cut her in half, forming Heaven of one part and Earth of the other ‚Äì this, Berossus claims to have been an allegory. The text also describes the beheading of a god, and the mixing of the god's blood with the Earth's soil, leading to the creation of men (people). Finally, there is also reference to Bel's creation of the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets. Berossus also gave an account of the Oannes, a sort of fish-man hybrid, who appeared from the sea and taught people all manner of knowledge, including writing, lawmaking, construction, mathematics, and agriculture; Berossus presented the account of creation in the form of a speech given by the Oannes. The neo-platonist Damascius also gave a short version of the Babylonian cosmological view, which closely matches the En√ªma Eli≈°. Clay tablets containing inscriptions relating to analogues of biblical stories were discovered by A.H. Layard, Hormuzd Rassam, and George Smith in the ruins of the Palace and Library of Ashur-bani-pal (668626 BCE) during excavations at the mound of Kuyunjik, Nineveh (near Mosul) between 1848 and 1876. Smith worked through Rassam's find of ~20,000 fragments from 1852, and identified references to the kings Shalmaneser II, Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and other rulers mentioned in the Bible ‚Äì furthermore he discovered versions of a Babylonian deluge myth (see Gilgamesh flood myth), as well as creation myths. On examination it became clear that the Assyrian myths were drawn from or similar to the Babylonian ones. Additionally Sir Henry Rawlinson had noted similarities between Biblical accounts of creation and the geography of Babylonia; he suggested that biblical creation stories might have their origin in that area. A link was found on a tablet labelled K 63 at the British Museum's collection by Smith, as well as similar text on other tablets. Smith then began searching the collection for textual similarities between the two mythoses, and found several references to a deluge myth with an 'Izdubar' (literal translation of cuneiform for Gilgamesh). Smith's publication of his work led to an expedition to Assyria funded by the Daily Telegraph ‚Äì there he found further tablets describing the deluge as well as fragmentary accounts of creation, a text on a war between good and evil 'gods', and a Fall of man myth. A second expedition by Smith brought back further creation legend fragments. By 1875 he had returned and began publishing accounts of these discoveries in the Daily Telegraph from 4 March 1875. Smith envisioned that the creation myth, including a part describing the fall of man must have originally spanned at least nine or ten tablets. He also identified tablets that in part were closer with Borussus' account. Some of Smith's early correspondences, such as references to the stories of the temptation of Eve, to the Tower of Babel, and to instructions given from God to Adam and Eve, were later held to be erroneous. The connection with the Bible stories brought a great deal of additional attention to the tablets ‚Äì in addition to Smith's early scholarship on the tablets, early translation work included that done by E. Schrader, A.H. Sayce, and Jules Oppert. In 1890 P. Jensen published a translation and commentary Die Kosmologie der Babylonier , followed by an updated translation in his 1900 \\"Mythen und Epen\\" ; in 1895 Prof. Zimmern of Leipzig gave a translation of all known fragments, , shortly followed by a translation by Friedrich Delitzsch, as well as contributions by several other authors. In 1898, the trustees of the British Museum ordered publication of a collation of all the Assyrian and Babylonian creation texts held by them, a work which was undertaken by L.W.King. King concluded that the creation myth as known in Nineveh was originally contained on seven tablets. This collection was published 1901 as \\"Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum\\" (Part XIII) . King published his own translations and notes in two volumes with additional material 1902 as The Seven Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends concerning the creation of the world and of mankind. By then additional fragments of tablet six had been found, concerning the creation of man ‚Äì here Marduk was found to have made man from his blood combined with bone, which brought comparison with Genesis 2:23 (\\"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man\\") where the creation of woman required the use of a man's bone. New material contributing to the fourth and sixth tablets also further corroborated other elements of Berossus' account. The seventh tablet added by King was a praise of Marduk, using around fifty titles over more than one hundred lines of cuneiform. Thus King's composition of the En√ªma Eli≈° consisted of five parts ‚Äì the birth of gods, legend of Ea and Apsu, Dragon (Tiamat) myth, account of creation, and finally a hymn to Marduk using his many titles. Importantly, tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian, when possessing colophons had the number of the tablet inscribed. Further expeditions by German researchers uncovered further tablet fragments (specifically tablet 1, 6, and 7) during the period 1902‚Äì1914 ‚Äì these works replaced Marduk with the Assyrian god Ashur; additional important sources for tablets 1 and 6, and tablet 7 were discovered by expeditions in 1924‚Äì25, and 1928‚Äì29 respectively. The Ashur texts uncovered by the Germans necessitated some corrections ‚Äì it was Kingu not Marduk who was killed and whose blood made men. These discoveries were further supplemented by purchases from antiquity dealers ‚Äì as a result by the mid 20th century most of the text of the work was known, with the exception of tablet 5.(Although a version of tablet 5 was recently discovered in 2011 in the Iraq museum archives) These further discoveries were complemented by a stream of publications and translations in the early 20th century. In the 21st century, the text continues to be a subject of active research, analysis, or discussion ‚Äì significant publications include The Standard Babylonian Creation Myth En≈´ma Eli≈° ; Das Babylonische Weltsch√∂pfungsepos Enuma Elis , and Babylonian Creation Myths ; as well as other works. = Dating of the myth = A bas-relief thought to be of Marduk and Tiamat from a temple at Nimrud dates the legend to at least the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883‚Äì859 BCE) King's set of tablets dated to no earlier than the 7th century BCE, being from the library of Ashur-bani-pal at Nineveh ‚Äì however King proposed that the tablets were copies of earlier Babylonian works as they glorified Marduk (of Babylon), and not the Assyrians' favored god Ashur. He also thought sculptures found at the temple of Ninib at Nimrud depicted Marduk fighting Tiamat and so date the dragon legend to at least Ashurnasirpal II (883‚Äì859 BCE), two centuries earlier than the date of Ashur- bani-pal's library. Legends of Tiamat and her monsters existed much earlier, as far as the Kassite ruler Agum I, ~17th C. BCE. It has been suggested that the myth, or at least the promotion of Marduk in it, dates to the ascendancy of the First Babylonian dynasty (1894‚Äì1595 BCE), during the same period that Marduk became a national god. A similar promotion of Marduk is seen in the first lines of the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1754 BCE). = Variants = Numerous copies of the tablets exist ‚Äì even by 1902 fragments of four copies of the first tablet were known, as well as extracts, possibly examples of 'handwriting practice'. Tablets from the library of Ashur-bani-pal tended to be well written on fine clay, whereas the Neo-Babylonian tablets were often less well written and made, though fine examples existed. All tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian had the text in lines, not columns, and the form of the text was generally identical between both. A tablet at the British Museum (No 93014.), known as the \\"bilingual\\" version of the creation legend describes the creation of man, and animals (by Marduk with the aid of Aruru), as well as the creation of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, of land and plants, as well as the first houses and cities. Other variants of the creation myth can be found described in and  Text  Neo-Assyrian cylinder seal impression from the eighth century BCE identified by several sources as a possible depiction of the slaying of Tiamat from the En√ªma Eli≈°. The epic itself does not rhyme, and has no meter ‚Äì it is composed of couplets, usually written on the same line, occasionally forming quatrains. The title En√ªma Eli≈°, meaning \\"when on high\\", is the incipit. :The following per tablet summary is based on the translation in Akkadian Myths and Epics (E.A. Speiser), in Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament = Tablet 1 = The tale begins before creation, when only the primordial entities Apsu and Tiamat existed, co-mingled together. There were no other things or gods, nor had any destinies been foretold. Then from the mixture of Apsu and Tiamat two gods issued ‚Äì Lahmu and Lahamu; next Anshar and Kishar were created. From Anshar came firstly the god Anu, and from Anu, came Nudimmud (also known as Ea). The commotion of these new gods disturbed and disgusted Tiamat, and Apsu could not calm them. Apsu called Mummu to speak with Tiamat, and he proposed to destroy the new gods, but Tiamat was reluctant to destroy what they had made. Mummu advised Apsu to destroy them, and he embraced Mummu. The new gods heard of this and were worried ‚Äì Ea however crafted a spell to lull Apsu to sleep. Mummu sought to wake Apsu but could not ‚Äì Ea took Apsu's halo and wore it himself, slew Apsu, and chained Mummu. Apsu became the dwelling place of Ea, together with his wife Damkina. Within the heart of Apsu Ea and Damkina created Marduk. The splendor of Marduk exceeded Ea and the other gods, and Ea called him \\"My son, the Sun!\\". Anu created the four winds. Other gods taunted Tiamat: 'When your consort (Apsu) was slain you did nothing', and complained of the wearisome wind. Tiamat then made monsters to battle the other gods, eleven chimeric creatures with weapons, with the god Kingu chief of the war party and her new consort. She gave Kingu the 'Tablet of Destinies', making his command unchallengeable. = Tablet 2 = Ea heard of Tiamat's plan to fight and avenge Apsu. He spoke to his grandfather Anshar, telling that many gods had gone to Tiamat's cause, and that she had created eleven monstrous creatures fit for war, and made Kingu their leader, wielding the 'Tablet of Destinies'. Anshar was troubled and told Anu to go to appease Tiamat, but he was too weak to face her and turned back. Anshar became more worried, thinking no god could resist Tiamat. Finally, Anshar proposed Marduk as their champion. Marduk was brought forth, and asked what god he must fightto which Anshar replied that it was not a god but the goddess Tiamat. Marduk confidently predicted his victory, but exacted their promise to proclaim him supreme god, with authority over even Anshar. = Tablet 3 = Anshar spoke to Gaga, who advised him to fetch Lahmu and Lahamu and tell them of Tiamat's war plans, and of Marduk's demand for overlordship if he defeats her. Lahmu and Lahamu and other Igigi (heavenly gods) were distressed, but drank together, becoming drowsy, and finally approving the compact with Marduk. = Tablet 4 = Marduk was given a throne, and sat over the other gods, who honored him. Marduk was also given a sceptre and vestments, as well as weapons to fight Tiamat ‚Äì bow, quiver, mace, and bolts of lightning, together with the four winds ‚Äì his body was aflame. Using the four winds Marduk trapped Tiamat. Adding a whirlwind, a cyclone, and Imhullu (\\"the Evil Wind\\"), together the seven winds stirred up Tiamat. In his war chariot drawn by four creatures he advanced. He challenged Tiamat, stating she had unrightfully made Kingu her consort, accusing her of being the source of the trouble. Enraged, Tiamat joined Marduk in single combat. Marduk used a net, a gift from Anu, to entangle Tiamat; Tiamat attempted to swallow Marduk, but 'the Evil Wind' filled her mouth. With the winds swirling within her she became distended ‚Äì Marduk then fired his arrow, hitting her heart ‚Äì she was slain. The other gods attempted to flee but, Marduk captured them, broke their weapons, and netted them. Her eleven monsters were also captured and chained; whilst Kingu was taken to Uggae (the Angel of Death), the 'Tablet of Destinies' taken from him. Marduk then smashed Tiamat's head with the mace, whilst her blood is carried off by the North Wind. Marduk then split Tiamat's remains in two ‚Äì from one half he made the sky ‚Äì in it he made places for Anu, Enlil, and Ea. = Tablet 5 = Marduk made likenesses of the gods in the constellations, and defined the days of the year from them. He created night and day, and the moon also. He created clouds and rain, and their water made the Tigris and Euphrates. He gave the 'Tablet of Destinies' to Anu. Statues of the eleven monsters of Tiamat were made and installed at the gate of Apsu. = Tablet 6 = Marduk then spoke to Ea ‚Äì saying he would use his blood to create man ‚Äì and that man would serve the gods. Ea advised one of the gods be chosen as a sacrifice ‚Äì the Igigi advised that Kingu be chosen ‚Äì his blood was then used to create man. Marduk then divided the gods into \\"above\\" and \\"below\\" ‚Äì three hundred in the heavens, six hundred on earth. The gods then proposed to build a throne or shrine for him ‚Äì Marduk told them to construct Babylon. The gods then spent a year making bricks ‚Äì they built the Esagila (Temple to Marduk) to a great height, making it a place for Marduk, Ea, and Enlil. A banquet was then held, with fifty of the great gods taking seats. Anu praising Enlil's bow and then Marduk. The first nine names or titles of Marduk were given. = Tablet 7 = The remainder of Marduk's fifty names or titles were read. = Colophon = Tablets Smith examined also contained attributions on the rear of the tablet ‚Äì the first tablet contained eight lines of a colophon ‚Äì Smith's reconstruction and translation of this states :  Significance, interpretation, and ritual use  The En√ªma Eli≈° is the primary source for Mesopotamian cosmology. According to Heidel its main purpose was as a praise of Marduk, and was important in making that Babylonian god head of the entire pantheon, through his deeds in defeating Tiamat, and in creation of the universe. Heidel also considers the text to have a political as well as religious message; that is, the promotion to primacy of a Babylonian god to better justify any Babylonian influence over the whole Mesopotamian region. The text as a whole contains many words which are Sumerian in origin, including the names of Tiamat's monsters, Marduk's wind, and the name for man used is the Sumerian lullu; however the chief god in the epic is the Babylonian Marduk, and not the Sumerian Enlil. A ritual text from the Seleucid period states that the En√ªma Eli≈° was recited during the Akitu festival. There is scholarly debate as to whether this reading occurred, its purpose, and even the identity of the text referred to. Most analysists consider that the festival concerned and included some form of re-enactment of Tiamat's defeat by Marduk, representing a renewal cycle and triumph over chaos. However a more detailed analysis by Jonathan Z. Smith led him to argue that the ritual should be understood in terms of its post-Assyrian and post-Babylonian imperial context, and may include elements of psychological and political theater legitimizing the non-native Seleucid rulers; he also questions whether the En√ªma Eli≈° read during that period was the same as that known to the ancient Assyrians. Whether the En√ªma Eli≈° creation myth was created for the Akitu ritual, or vice versa, or neither, is unclear; nevertheless there are definite connections in subject matter between the myth and festival, and there is also evidence of the festival as celebrated during the neo-Babylonian period that correlates well with the En√ªma Eli≈° myth. A version of the En√ªma Eli≈° is also thought to have been read during the month of Kislimu. It has been suggested that ritual reading of the poem coincided with spring flooding of the Tigris or Euphrates following the melting of snow in mountainous regions upstream ‚Äì this interpretation is supported by the defeat of the (watery being) Tiamat by Marduk. Influence on biblical research The En√ªma Eli≈° contains numerous parallels with passages of the Old Testament, which has led some researchers to conclude that these were based on the Mesopotamian work. Overarching similarities include: reference to a watery chaos before creation; a separation of the chaos into heaven and earth; different types of waters and their separation; as well as the numerical similarity between the seven tablets of the epic and the seven days of creation. However, another analysis notes many differences, including polytheism vs. monotheism, and personification of forces and qualities in the Babylonian myth vs. imperative creation by God in the biblical stories; permanence of matter vs. creation out of nothing; and the lack of any real parallel for Marduk's long battles with monsters. He also notes some broad commonalities of both texts with other religions, such as a watery chaos found in Egyptian, Phoenician, and Vedic works; and that both texts were written in languages with a common Semitic root. Regarding the creation of man, there are similarities in the use of dust or clay, but man's purpose is inverted in the two texts: in the En√ªma Eli≈° man is created as a servant of gods, whereas in Genesis man is given more agency. Nevertheless in both, the dust is infused with \\"godhood\\", either through a god's blood in the En√ªma Eli≈°, or by being made in God's image in Genesis. As to the seven tablets and seven days of each system, the numbered itineraries in general do not closely match, but there are some commonalities in order of the creation events: first darkness, then light, the firmament, dry land, and finally man, followed by a period of rest. Different theories have been proposed to explain the parallels. Based on an analysis of proper names in the texts, A.T. Clay proposed that the En√ªma Eli≈° was a combination of a Semitic myth from Amurru and a Sumerian myth from Eridu; this theory is thought to lack historical or archaeological evidence. An alternative theory posits a westward spread of the Mesopotamian myth to other cultures such as the Hebrews; additionally, the Hebrews would have been influenced by Mesopotamian culture during their Babylonian captivity. A third explanation supposes a common ancestor for both religious systems. Conrad Hyers of the Princeton Theological Seminary suggests that Genesis, rather than adopting earlier Babylonian and other creation myths, polemically addressed them to \\"repudiate the divinization of nature and the attendant myths of divine origins, divine conflict, and divine ascent\\". According to this theory, the En√ªma Eli≈° elaborated the interconnections between the divine and inert matter, while the aim of Genesis was to state the supremacy of the Hebrew God Yahweh Elohim over all creation (and all other deities). The broken En√ªma Eli≈° tablet seems to refer to a concept of sabbath. A contextual restoration contains the rarely attested Sapattum or Sabattum as the full moon, cognate or merged with Hebrew Shabbat (cf. ), but monthly rather than weekly; it is regarded as a form of Sumerian sa-bat (\\"mid-rest\\"), attested in Akkadian as um nuh libbi (\\"day of mid-repose\\").

History  The society was founded by young supporters of the Parti patriote who became impatient with the pace of progress of the movement for constitutional and parliamentary reforms. One of the principal founder was young Am√©d√©e Papineau, the son of the famous politician Louis-Joseph Papineau. The organization took its name from the American Sons of Liberty founded by Samuel Adams during the American Revolution. The Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√© held its first public assembly on September 5 and began to recruit men to form militias. A public assembly was held every Monday after its foundation. It published a manifesto on October 4 and adopted a national anthem for Canada. The organization had two sections: a civil one, led by Andr√© Ouimet, Louis-Joseph Papineau and Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan and a military one, led by Thomas Storrow Brown. Am√©d√©e Papineau came up with the motto of the soci√©t√© En avant (French for \\"go forward\\"). Various organizations had already been formed who pressured the Governor Lord Gosford to act and quell the upcoming rebellion before lives were lost and property destroyed. At the Assembl√©e des Six-Comt√©s, on October 23, those in attendance sanctioned the Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√©. However, the organization disappeared shortly after the confrontation with the Doric Club on November 6. Following the November 16 order to arrest 26 Patriote leaders on charges of sedition, including Papineau, O'Callaghan, Brown and Ouimet, many members of the Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√© took part in the armed conflict of 1837 and the two invasion attempts of 1838.

It abolished the legislatures of Lower Canada and Upper Canada and established a new political entity, the Province of Canada to replace them. The Act was similar in nature and in goals to the other Acts of Union enacted by the British Parliament.  Background  = Rebellion of Lower Canada = After the War of 1812, the elected assembly of Lower Canada was dominated by French Canadians. A strong sense of nationalism sprung up among the francophones living in Lower Canada. The nationalists were led by Louis- Joseph Papineau, who was a part of what would later be known as the Patriot Party. One of its biggest demands was to determine how the colony's revenue would be spent. It challenged the authority of the upper house or legislative government. As well, the party sought to take control of civil services such as executive council, which advised the sitting governor-general. All of the demands were refuted by the current Governor-General, Earl of Dalhousie, who served as the governor-general of British North America from 1820 to 1828. However, in 1828, the Earl of Dalhousie was replaced because of a negative report given by Members of Parliament comprising British reformers who sought to make peace with the Lower Canadian Assembly. The next Governor-General was Sir James Kempt, who lasted from 1828 to 1830. Kempt's time in office briefly eased tensions between the Patriot Party and the existing government. The next two Governor Generals, Lord Aylmer (1830‚Äì1835) and Lord Gosford (1835-1838), also sought to reconcile the government with the ever-growing demands of the people. The situation in Lower Canada continued to worsen, nevertheless. The French and the English living in Lower Canada became increasingly polarized from one another, as tensions continue to grow. The Patriot Party tried to reason with British rule, including by sending the Ninety-Two Resolutions. The British Parliament ignored the resolutions for about three years and then all but dismissed them. Eventually, the Patriot Party organized and executed two rebellions, the first in November 1837 and the second in November 1838. French and English Patriots battled with British soldiers, French Canadian officers and English Montrealers. Both times, a lack of organization and numbers made the Patriots fall within a week of the rebellions' start. = Rebellion in Upper Canada = The rebellion that took place in Upper Canada in 1837 was less violent than its counterpoint in Lower Canada had been. However, Upper Canadian rebels were equally serious in their demands. The main leader of the rebellion was William Lyon Mackenzie. Its demands included democratic reform and the end of the rule of privileged oligarchy. The rebellion in Upper Canada ran from December 5 to 8. The transfer of some of Britain's militia force to Lower Canada inspired rebels to try to seize the government and institute the constitution they had drafted, similar to that of the US Constitution. The rebels were dispersed by British arms and a group of government volunteers. = Effects of the rebellions = Because of the rebellions, the Crown and the British Parliament sent John George Lambton, Earl of Durham, back to Canada to report on what had caused the rebellions and outline suggestions on how to best fix the situation. The investigation is now commonly known as the Durham Report. Because of suggestions by Lord Durham in his report, the British Parliament united Upper and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada.  History  Political organization under the Union Act (1840)Political organization under the Union Act (1848) Lord Durham wanted to re-instate peace throughout the colonies and recommended a political union. It was under his belief that peace could best be achieved by ensuring a loyal English majority in British North America, as well as by anglicizing French Canadians, and by granting responsible government.ARCHIVED - Upper Canada - Towards Confederation - Canadian Confederation - Library and Archives Canada.

Due to Upper Canada's considerable debt and chronic budget shortfalls, it was hoped that its finances could be salvaged by merging it with the then-solvent Lower Canada. Upper Canada, with its British and Protestant majority, was growing more rapidly than Lower Canada, with the French-Canadian and Catholic majority. It was hoped that by merging the two colonies, the French-Canadian cultural presence in North America would gradually disappear through assimilation. As such, the Act also contained measures banning the French language from official use in the Legislative Assembly. However, despite the amalgamation, the distinct legal systems of the two colonies were retained with Upper Canada becoming referred to as Canada West (with English common law) and Lower Canada as Canada East (with French civil law). In Upper Canada, there was opposition to unionization from the Family Compact, while in Lower Canada political and religious leaders reacted against Upper Canada's anti- French measures.  Main provisions  The Act established a single parliament with an equal number of seats for each region, now called Canada East and Canada West. Both regions‚Äô debts were consolidated. A permanent Civil List was created. The French language was banished from official government use. Specific French Canadian institutions related to education and civil law were suspended. The legislation to fuse the two separate colonies into one functioning unit that would operate under one government instead of two separate legislations was brought before the British House of Commons in May 1839. Later the legislation was sent for approval by both Upper and Lower Canada by way of Charles Poulett Thomson. He received acceptance of the legislation by both colonies in November and December of the same year. The legislation then became in Act in July 1840 when passed by the British Parliament. On the 10 of February 1841, it was declared in Montreal, officially marking the beginning of the newly-formed Province of Canada. The capitol was moved to Kingston. One of the main provisions of the act was establishing a single parliament with an equal number of seats per region. Canada West, with its 450,000 inhabitants, was represented by 42 seats in the Legislative Assembly, the same number as the more-populated Canada East, with 650,000 inhabitants. The French-Canadian majority, as well as numerous anglophones, considered this an injustice. In Lower Canada, Louis-Joseph Papineau demanded representation by population and the recall of the union the minute he entered the new parliament of the united Canadas. Debts from Upper and Lower Canada were also combined and transferred to the Province of Canada. The granting of responsible government to the colony is typically attributed to reforms in 1848 (principally the effective transfer of control over patronage from the governor to the elected ministry). The reforms resulted in the appointment of the second Baldwin-Lafontaine government that quickly removed many of the disabilities on French-Canadian political participation in the colony.  Effects  By the late 1850s, massive immigration from the British Isles to Canada West changed the previous demographic imbalance between the English and French sections of the colony. Many politicians in Canada West began to lobby for representation by population, as they no longer considered the equal representation mandated by the Act of Union to be just. In the end, the Act of Union failed at shutting down French-Canadian political influence, especially after responsible government was granted to the colony. By voting en bloc the francophones of Canada East guaranteed a strong, unified presence in the Legislative Assemblybsince the anglophones of Canada West were highly factionalized As a result, bills proposed by one of the anglophone Canada West factions required the support of the francophone Canada East votes to be passed. That was known as the double majority principle and reflected the duality of the two administrations. The principle was never officially recognized and became obviously impracticable. However, the francophone presence remained inferior to their demographic weight in the executive and legislative councils. The government of Lafontaine-Baldwin succeeded in repealing the measure against the French language in the assembly, the courts, and the civil administration. With the double majority principle, both Canadas were \\"reseparated,\\" and for a short while, both sides were managed independently. Joint premierships shared by an anglophone from Canada West and a francophone from Canada East became the convention, but continual legislative deadlock resulting from the conflicting aspirations of the two Canadas remained. Dissatisfaction resulting from the deadlock was one of the main factors for Canadian Confederation in 1867.

The Institute provided a public library and debating room for its members. At the time, there were no French- language universities nor public libraries in Montreal. Between 1845 and 1871, some 136 lectures were held inside the Institute's walls. The Institute eventually came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church over the contents of its library. Partly as a result of the dispute with the Church, the Institute eventually folded in the 1870s. Origins The Institute was founded in 1844 as a literary and scientific institution, for the purposes of providing a library, reading-room, and other educational purposes. Joseph Papin was the first president. In 1853, it was incorporated by an Act of the Province of Canada.Statutes of the Province of Canada, 16 Vict., c. 261. At the time of incorporation, the Institute had over 500 members, a library of over 2000 volumes, and a reading-room with newspapers and periodical publications.Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al (1874), L.R. 6 P.C. 157, [1874 UKPC 70] (P.C.), at p. 193 (L.R.), p. 3 (UKPC). The Institute was the source of the ideas defended by the Parti rouge. One of its mottos was: Justice pour nous, justice pour tous; Raison et libert√© pour nous, raison et libert√© pour tous (Justice for us, justice for all; reason and liberty for us, reason and liberty for all). The library contained literary works by French romantic authors, such as Victor Hugo and Alphonse de Lamartine, and Enlightenment authors, such as Voltaire and Diderot, whose writings were judged immoral by the Catholic Church. Between 1845 and 1871, some 136 lectures were held inside the institute's walls.Lemire. p. 151 Dispute with the Church In 1858, an issue arose about the contents of the library. At a meeting of the Institute, some members proposed establishing a committee to review the library and to make a list of books which should not be allowed to remain in the library. This proposal was defeated by a considerable majority, which instead passed a resolution that the Institute's library did not contain any improper books, that the Institute was the sole judge of the morality of the books in the library, and that the existing committee of management was sufficient.Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al (1874), at p. 193 (L.R.), p. 3 (UKPC). Following this motion, a group of 158 members left the institute to found the Institut canadien-fran√ßais de Montr√©al, which opted to obey the doctrine of the Catholic clergy and did not lend books which the Church judged immoral.Champagne. , p. 122Turcotte, p. 433 On 13 April 1858, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Montreal, Mgr Ignace Bourget, published a pastoral which was read in all the churches of his diocese. In the pastoral, he referred to the proceedings at the Institute and praised the conduct of the minority. He stated that the majority had fallen into two great errors: by declaring that the members of the Institute were the proper judges of the morality of the books in their library, contrary to the declaration at the Council of Trent which held that judging the morality of books is a function of the bishop; and by declaring that the library contained no immoral books, when in fact it contained books on the Church's Index of Prohibited Books. He pointed out that the Council of Trent had held that anyone who read or kept heretical works would incur sentence of excommunication, and that anyone who read or kept books forbidden on other grounds would be subject to severe punishment. He concluded by making an appeal to the members of the Institute to alter their resolution, stating that otherwise, no Catholic would continue to belong to it.Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al, at pp. 193-194 (L.R.), pp. 3-4 (UKPC). The Institute did not rescind the resolution. In 1865, several members of the Institute, including Joseph Guibord, appealed to Rome against this pastoral, but received no answer.Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al, at p. 194 (L.R.), p. 4 (UKPC). On July 7, 1869, Rome added the institute's Annuaire for the year 1868 to the Catholic Church's Index of prohibited books. Bishop Bourget published another pastoral letter, drawing attention to this decision and pointing out the Church had decreed that no Catholic was to belong to the Institute while it taught pernicious doctrines, nor to keep, publish or read the 1868 Annuaire. He stated that any person who persisted in keeping or reading the Annuaire, or in belonging to the Institute, would be deprived of the sacrament, \\"m√™me √† l'article de la mort.\\"Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al, at p. 196 (L.R.), pp. 5-6 (UKPC). In response, the members of the Institute on 23 September 1869 passed a resolution declaring that it did not teach any pernicious doctrine, and that the members of the Institute, having learnt of the condemnation of the 1868 Annuaire, declared that they would submit purely and simply to this decree. Bishop Bourget responded in a letter condemning these resolutions as hypocritical, stating that the Institute had simultaneously passed a secret resolution in favour of religious tolerance, and stating that there would be no absolution for those who remained members of the Institute.Brown v. Les Cur√© et Marguilliers de l'≈íuvre et de la Fabrique de la Paroisse de Montr√©al, at pp. 196-197 (L.R.), p. 6 (UKPC). The Guibord Case One of the founding members of the Institute was a printer and typographer named Joseph Guibord. In 1869, Guibord died. Bourget refused to let Henrietta Brown, Guibord's widow, bury her husband's remains in the Catholic section of the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery because he was a member of the Institute. The widow did not accept the decision and decided to bring the case to court. Henrietta Brown's lawyer, Joseph Doutre, also a member of the Institute, ultimately won his case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire, including Canada, on November 21, 1874. The Guibord case became a point of great political and religious controversy. Closure of the Institute The Institut canadien of Montreal closed the doors of its debating room in 1871, and the library closed in 1880. Only the Institut canadien de Qu√©bec, founded four years after that of Montreal, survived the Church's censorship by getting rid of certain works prohibited by the Roman Catholic Church. In 2006, the Biblioth√®que et Archives nationales du Qu√©bec (BAnQ) concluded a deal with the Fraser-Hickson Institute on the donation and transfer of property of the collection of the Institut canadien de Montr√©al. The latter had preserved it since 1885.Marie Aguettant. \\"Collection de l'Institut canadien de Montr√©al\\", in Univarts, November 4, 2006 Among the precious books of the collection were two editions of the ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire (1785‚Äì1789), 36 volumes of L'Encyclop√©die by Diderot and d'Alembert (1778‚Äì1781), 12 volumes of L'Esprit des journaux fran√ßais et √©trangers (1787‚Äì1792) and four volumes of R√©union des Tuileries au Louvre (1852‚Äì1857), a particular gift of Prince Napol√©on to the Institut canadien.

A broker who also acts as a seller or as a buyer becomes a principal party to the deal. Neither role should be confused with that of an agent‚Äîone who acts on behalf of a principal party in a deal. Definition A broker is an independent party, whose services are used extensively in some industries. A broker's prime responsibility is to bring sellers and buyers together and thus a broker is the third-person facilitator between a buyer and a seller. An example would be a real estate or stock broker who facilitates the sale of a property. Brokers can furnish market research and market data. Brokers may represent either the seller or the buyer but generally not both at the same time. Brokers are almost always necessary for the purchase and sale of financial instruments. Brokers are expected to have the tools and resources to reach the largest possible base of buyers and sellers. They then screen these potential buyers or sellers for the perfect match. An individual producer, on the other hand, especially one new in the market, probably will not have the same access to customers as a broker. Another benefit of using a broker is cost‚Äîthey might be cheaper in smaller markets, with smaller accounts, or with a limited line of products. Some types of brokers, such as real estate brokers, often have strict state requirements for using the term, while others, such as aircraft brokers, typically have no formal licensing or training requirements. Some brokers, known as discount brokers, charge smaller commission, sometimes in exchange for offering less advice or services than full service brokerage firms. A broker-dealer is a broker that transacts for its own account, in addition to facilitating transactions for clients. Brokerage firms are generally subject to regulations based on the type of brokerage and jurisdictions in which they operate. Examples of brokerage firm regulatory agencies include the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which regulate stockbrokers in the United States. Etymology The word \\"broker\\" derives from Old French broceur \\"small trader\\", of uncertain origin, but possibly from Old French brocheor meaning \\"wine retailer\\", which comes from the verb brochier, or \\"to broach (a keg)\\".

It was formerly considered to be conspecific with Sykes's warbler, but the two are now usually both afforded species status. Booted warbler itself breeds from central Russia to western China, and migrates to winter in the Indian subcontinent as far south as Sri Lanka. Booted warbler has expanded its breeding range westward in recent decades and nests now as far west and north as Finland. It is a small passerine bird, found in open country with bushes and other tall vegetation. 3-4 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or vegetation. Like most warblers they are insectivorous. These are small warblers, especially compared to others in their genus. They are pale brown (weak tea colour) above and whitish below with buff flanks. The outer tail feathers have pale edges.

Note that the I and Q chroma coordinates are scaled up to 1.0. See the formulae below in the article to get the right bounds. An image along with its Y, I, and Q components. YIQ is the color space used by the NTSC color TV system, employed mainly in North and Central America, and Japan. I stands for in-phase, while Q stands for quadrature, referring to the components used in quadrature amplitude modulation. Some forms of NTSC now use the YUV color space, which is also used by other systems such as PAL. The Y component represents the luma information, and is the only component used by black-and-white television receivers. I and Q represent the chrominance information. In YUV, the U and V components can be thought of as X and Y coordinates within the color space. I and Q can be thought of as a second pair of axes on the same graph, rotated 33¬∞; therefore IQ and UV represent different coordinate systems on the same plane. The YIQ system is intended to take advantage of human color-response characteristics. The eye is more sensitive to changes in the orange-blue (I) range than in the purple- green range (Q)--therefore less bandwidth is required for Q than for I. Broadcast NTSC limits I to 1.3 MHz and Q to 0.4 MHz. I and Q are frequency interleaved into the 4 MHz Y signal, which keeps the bandwidth of the overall signal down to 4.2 MHz. In YUV systems, since U and V both contain information in the orange-blue range, both components must be given the same amount of bandwidth as I to achieve similar color fidelity. Very few television sets perform true I and Q decoding, due to the high costs of such an implementation. Compared to the cheaper R-Y and B-Y decoding which requires only one filter, I and Q each requires a different filter to satisfy the bandwidth differences between I and Q. These bandwidth differences also require that the 'I' filter include a time delay to match the longer delay of the 'Q' filter. The Rockwell Modular Digital Radio (MDR) was one I and Q decoding set, which in 1997 could operate in frame-at-a-time mode with a PC or in realtime with the Fast IQ Processor (FIQP). Some RCA \\"Colortrak\\" home TV receivers made circa 1985 not only used I/Q decoding, but also advertised its benefits along with its comb filtering benefits as full \\"100 percent processing\\" to deliver more of the original color picture content. Earlier, more than one brand of color TV (RCA, Arvin) used I/Q decoding in the 1954 or 1955 model year on models utilizing screens about 13 inches (measured diagonally). The original Advent projection television used I/Q decoding. Around 1990, at least one manufacturer (Ikegami) of professional studio picture monitors advertised I/Q decoding.  Image processing  The YIQ representation is sometimes employed in color image processing transformations. For example, applying a histogram equalization directly to the channels in an RGB image would alter the color balance of the image. Instead, the histogram equalization is applied to the Y channel of the YIQ or YUV representation of the image, which only normalizes the brightness levels of the image.

The term, in diplomacy, originates from around 1912 when France and Germany tried unsuccessfully to reduce tensions. Most often, the term is used for a phase of the Cold War. It was the policy of relaxing tensions between the Soviet Union and the West, as promoted by Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Leonid Brezhnev, between 1969 and 1974. With the United States showing weakness at the top that forced Nixon out of office, Brezhnev used the opportunity to expand Soviet influence. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 decisively ended any talk of d√©tente.. The term is also used to refer to the Cuban thaw, which resulted in Cuba and the United States restoring diplomatic relations with each other in 2015. The term is most often used to refer to a period of general easing of the geopolitical tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States that was a distinct lessening of the Cold War. It began in 1969, as a core element of the foreign policy of US President Richard Nixon, in an effort to avoid nuclear escalation. The Nixon administration promoted greater dialogue with the Soviet government, including regular summit meetings and negotiations over arms control and other bilateral agreements. D√©tente was known in Russian as —Ä–∞–∑—Ä—è–¥–∫–∞ (razryadka), loosely meaning \\"relaxation of tension\\". Summary of Cold War d√©tente The period was characterized by the signing of treaties such as SALT I and the Helsinki Accords. Another treaty, SALT II, was discussed but never ratified by the US. There is still ongoing debate among historians as to how successful the d√©tente period was in achieving peace. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, both superpowers agreed to install a direct hotline between Washington, DC, and Moscow. The so-called red telephone enabled leaders of both countries to communicate with each other quickly in times of urgency and to reduce the chances of future crises escalating into an all-out war. The American-Soviet d√©tente was presented as an applied extension of that thinking. SALT II, in the late 1970s, continued the work of the SALT I talks by ensuring further reduction in arms by the Soviet Union and by the US. The Helsinki Accords, in which the Soviets promised to grant free elections in Europe, were called a major concession to ensure peace by the Soviets. D√©tente ended after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, which led to the United States boycott of the 1980 Olympics, held in Moscow. Ronald Reagan's election as president in 1980, based in large part on an anti-d√©tente campaign, marked the close of d√©tente and a return to Cold War tensions. In his first press conference, Reagan said, \\"D√©tente's been a one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims.\\" Relations continued to turn increasingly sour with the unrest in Poland, the end of the SALT II negotiations, and the NATO exercise in 1983, the last of which brought the superpowers almost on the brink of nuclear war. Summits and treaties Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin (front) next to US President Lyndon Johnson (behind) during the Glassboro Summit Conference The most obvious manifestation of d√©tente was the series of summits between the leaders of both superpowers and the treaties that resulted from those meetings. In the early 1960s, before d√©tente, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty had been signed on 5 August 1963. Later that decade, the January 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the July 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons were two of the first building blocks of d√©tente. The early treaties were signed all over the globe. When Nixon came into office in 1969, several important d√©tente treaties were developed. The Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact sent an offer to the US and the rest of the West that urged a summit on \\"security and cooperation in Europe\\" to be held. The West agreed, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began towards actual limits in the nuclear capabilities of both superpowers, which ultimately led to the signing of the SALT I treaty in 1972. It limited each power's nuclear arsenals but was quickly rendered outdated as a result of the development of MIRVs. Also in 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty were concluded, and talks on SALT II began the same year. The Washington Summit of 1973 further advanced mutual and international relations through discussion of diplomatic cooperation and continued discussion regarding limitations on nuclear weaponry Brezhnev, however, was intent on using the period of relaxed tensions to prepare for Soviet expansionism in his speeches during the start of the period at the Politburo in the 1980s.Gus W. Weiss. \\"videofact\\" In 1975, the Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE) in Europe met and produced the Helsinki Accords, a wide-ranging series of agreements on economic, political, and human rights issues. The CSCE was initiated by the Soviet Union and involved 35 states throughout Europe. One of the most prevalent and discussed issues after the conference was that of human rights violations in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Constitution directly violated the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, and that issue became a prominent point of separation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Carter administration had been supporting human rights groups inside the Soviet Union, and Leonid Brezhnev accused the US of interference in other countries' internal affairs. That prompted intense discussion of whether or not other nations may interfere if basic human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, are violated. The basic disagreement between the superpowers, a democracy and a one-party state, did not allow that issue to be reconciled. Furthermore, the Soviets proceeded to defend their internal policies on human rights by attacking American support of South Africa, Chile, and other countries that were known to violate many of the same human rights. In July 1975, the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project became the first international space mission; three American astronauts and two Soviet cosmonauts docked their spacecraft and conducted joint experiments. The mission had been preceded by five years of political negotiation and technical co-operation, including exchanges of American and Soviet engineers between both countries' space centers. Trade relations between both blocs increased substantially during the era of d√©tente. Most significant were the vast shipments of grain that were sent from the West to the Soviet Union each year and helped to make up for the failure of the kolkhoz, the Soviet collective farms. At the same time, the Jackson‚ÄìVanik Amendment, signed into US federal law by US President Gerald Ford on 3 January 1975 after a unanimous vote by both houses of the US Congress, was designed to leverage trade relations between the Americans and the Soviets. It linked US trade on improvements in human rights in the Soviet Union, particularly by allowing refuseniks to emigrate. It also added to the most favored nation status a clause that no country that resisted emigration could be awarded that status, which provided a method to link geopolitics to human rights. End of Vietnam War Nixon and his National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, moved toward d√©tente with the Soviet Union in the early the 1970s. They hoped, in return, for Soviet help the US extricate or remove itself from Vietnam. People then started to notice the consciousness with which US politicians started to act. Strategic Arms Limitations Talks US President Gerald Ford meets with Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev to sign a joint communiqu√© on the SALT treaty during the Vladivostok Summit in November 1974. Nixon and Brezhnev signed an ABM treaty in Moscow on 26 May 1972 as well as the Interim Agreement (SALT I), which temporarily capped the number of strategic arms (MIRVs, SLBMs, and ICBMs). That was a show of d√©tente militarily since an expansion of nuclear ballistic arms had started to occur. The goal of Nixon and Kissinger was to use arms control to promote a much broader policy of d√©tente, which could then allow the resolution of other urgent problems through what Nixon called \\"linkage.\\" David Tal argued: :The linkage between strategic arms limitations and outstanding issues such as the Middle East, Berlin and, foremost, Vietnam thus became central to Nixon's and Kissinger's policy of d√©tente. Through employment of linkage, they hoped to change the nature and course of U.S. foreign policy, including U.S. nuclear disarmament and arms control policy, and to separate them from those practiced by Nixon's predecessors. They also intended, through linkage, to make U.S. arms control policy part of d√©tente.... His policy of linkage had in fact failed. It failed mainly because it was based on flawed assumptions and false premises, the foremost of which was that the Soviet Union wanted strategic arms limitation agreement much more than the United States did.David Tal, \\"'Absolutes' and 'Stages' in the Making and Application of Nixon‚Äôs SALT Policy.\\" Diplomatic History 37.5 (2013): 1090-1116, quoting pp. 1091, 1092. Nixon himself later wrote that \\"we decided to link progress in such areas of Soviet concern as strategic arms limitation and increased trade with progress in areas that were important to us‚ÄìVietnam, the Mideast, and Berlin. This concept became known as linkage.\\" Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz handshake in space Apollo- Soyuz crew in 1975 A significant example of an event contributing to d√©tente was the handshake that took place in space. In July 1975, the first Soviet- American joint space flight was conducted, the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project. Its primary goal was the creation of an international docking system, which would allow two different spacecrafts to join in orbit. That would allow both crews on board to collaborate on space exploration. The project marked the end of the Space Race, which had started in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1 and allowed tensions between the Americans and the Soviets to decrease significantly.Samuels, Richard J., ed. (21 December 2005). Encyclopedia of United States National Security (1st ed.). SAGE Publications. p. 669. . Retrieved 25 May 2016. Most observers felt that the U.S. moon landing ended the space race with a decisive American victory.... The formal end of the space race occurred with the 1975 joint Apollo-Soyuz mission, in which U.S. and Soviet spacecraft docked, or joined, in orbit while their crews visited one another's craft and performed joint scientific experiments. Continued conflicts As direct relations thawed, increased tensions continued between both superpowers through their proxies, especially in the Third World. Conflicts in South Asia and the Middle East in 1973 saw the Soviet Union and the US backing their respective surrogates, such as in Afghanistan, with war material and diplomatic posturing. In Latin America, the US continued to block any left-wing electoral shifts in the region by supporting unpopular right- wing military coups and brutal military dictatorships. Meanwhile, there were also many communist or left-wing guerrillas around the region; the US alleged them to be backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. During much of the early d√©tente period, the Vietnam War continued to rage. Both sides still mistrusted each other, and the potential for nuclear war remained constant. Both sides continued aiming thousands of nuclear warheads atop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at each other's cities, maintaining submarines with long- range nuclear weapon capability (submarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBMs) in the world's oceans, keeping hundreds of nuclear-armed aircraft on constant alert, and guarding contentious borders in Korea and Europe with large ground forces. Espionage efforts remained a high priority, and defectors, reconnaissance satellites, and signal intercepts measured each other's intentions to try to gain a strategic advantage. Cold War flares up in 1979 The 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to shore up a struggling pro-Soviet regime led to harsh criticisms and a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics, held in Moscow. US President Jimmy Carter boosted the budget of the US Defense Department and began the financial aid office Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who, in turn, subsidized anti-Soviet mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan.Raymond L. Garthoff, Detente and confrontation: American-Soviet Relations From Nixon to Reagan (1985). Another contributing factor in the decline in the popularity of d√©tente, as a desirable US policy, was the interservice rivalry between the US State and Defense Departments of State. From 1973 to 1977, there were three secretaries worth mentioning: Elliot Richardson, James Schlesinger, and Donald Rumsfeld. Schlesinger's time as Secretary of Defense was plagued by notably-poor relations with Kissinger, one of the most prominent advocates of d√©tente in the US. Their poor working relationship bled into their professional relationship and so policy clashes would increasingly occur. They ultimately resulted in Schlesinger's dismissal in 1975. However, his replacement, Rumsfeld, shared Shlesinger's distaste for Kissinger. As a result, clashes on policy continued between the State and the Defense Departments. Rumsfeld thought that Kissinger was too complacent about the growing Soviet strength. Although Rumsfeld largely agreed with Kissinger's assessment that the United States possessed a superior military strength to that of the Soviet Union, he argued that Kissinger's public optimism would prevent Congress from allowing Defense Department the funds that Rumsfeld believed were required to maintain the favorable gap between the US and the Soviets. Rumsfeld responded by regularly presenting a more alarmist view of the superior strength of the Soviets, which he credited with convincing Congress to increase military spending. US President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev in 1985 In response to the stranglehold of influence by Kissinger in the Nixon and Ford administrations and the later decline in influence over foreign policy by the Department of Defense, Richardson, Schlesinger, and Rumsfeld all used the growing antipathy in the US for the Soviet Union to undermine Kissinger's attempts to achieve a comprehensive arms reduction treaty. That helped to portray the entire notion of d√©tente as an untenable policy.http://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/special_studies/SpecStudy7.pdf The 1980 American presidential election saw Ronald Reagan elected on a platform opposed to the concessions of d√©tente. Negotiations on SALT II were abandoned as a result. However, during the later years of Reagan's presidency, he and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev pursued a policy that was considered to be d√©tente. However, the Reagan administration talked about a \\"winnable\\" nuclear war and led the creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the Third World policy of funding irregular and paramilitary death squads in Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Cambodia, and Afghanistan. Cuban thaw On 17 December, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro announced the beginning of restoring diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. The restoration agreement was negotiated in secret, in preceding months, facilitated by Pope Francis and largely hosted by the Canadian government, who had warmer relations with Cuba at that time. Meetings were held in both Canada and the Vatican City. The agreement would see the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks' access to the Cuban financial system, and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban embassy in Washington, which both closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic relations as a result of Cuba's alliance with the Soviet Union. On 14 April 2015, the Obama administration announced it would be removing Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Cuba was officially removed from the list on 29 May, 2015. On 20 July, 2015, the Cuban and U.S. interest sections in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies. On 24 March 2016, Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Cuba, since 1928. However in 2017, Donald Trump who had succeeded Obama, as U.S. president stated that he was \\"canceling\\" the Obama administration's deals with Cuba, while also expressing that a new deal could be negotiated between the Cuban and United States governments.

The character is depicted as the occasional enemy of Wolverine. His first appearance was in Wolverine vol. 2, #4. The character was created by Chris Claremont and John Buscema. Fictional character biography Roughouse is one of the most mysterious opponents that Wolverine has come across. Little is known of his past beyond the fact that Roughouse is descended from one of the races that inhabit the dimension of Asgard, the mythical home of the Asgardian \\"gods.\\" In Wolverine vol. 2, #6, Roughouse provides the first clue to his origin by uttering the phrase, \\"Ymir's icy breath.\\" This is a reference to the giant Ymir, said to be the father of the race of beings known as the Frost Giants, the primary enemies of the Asgardian \\"gods.\\" He is also known to have been systematically abused by his father as a boy.Wolverine vol. 2 #22 Some writers have suggested that the reason Roughouse wears long hair and a full beard is to hide scars received at the hands of his father. In recent years, Roughouse has come to the island nation of Madripoor along with his partner, the \\"pseudo-vampire\\" Bloodscream. They have found employment under General Coy, one of the island's most powerful crime lords, as special enforcers used to eliminate any threats to his operations. They are sent after the woman called Tyger Tiger, Coy's primary rival as the supreme crime boss of Madripoor. This brings the two mercenaries into a number of conflicts with Wolverine. The duo are never able to defeat him. General Coy grows tired of Roughouse's failures and literally sells him to Geist (\\"Ghost\\"),Wolverine vol. 2 #17 a former high ranking agent of Nazi Germany in the United Kingdom and a cyborg. By the time Roughouse meets him, Geist is financing himself through illegal drug trade and needs a guinea pig on which to experiment a new drug. Geist's men give Roughouse a dose of this experimental version of cocaine which temporarily drives him mad.Wolverine vol. 2 #18 Wolverine holds back in the fight with Roughouse, since Roughouse is not truly even aware of what he is doing. After helping Roughouse escape, they come upon a mysterious nun of the Roman Catholic Church known only as Sister Salvation, who possesses the ability to cure those suffering from physical or mental injuries and cure sickness just by touching them with her hands. After several \\"sessions\\" she is able to fully purge Roughouse's body of the cocaine induced suffering. Roughhouse decides to stay with Sister Salvation in Tierra Verde to help her rebuild her destroyed mission. It would be quite a while before Wolverine and Roughouse would cross paths again. In Wolverine #123, Roughhouse and Bloodscream had now renewed their partnership and ambushed Wolverine after the adamantium has been stripped from his skeleton. They manage to get the upper hand and beat Wolverine unconscious. They bring him to their hideout where they beat him repeatedly over the next few days. Wolverine is able to free himself from the shackles by breaking his own wrist, and engage the duo in combat, as Roughouse was on his way to shoot him in the head. It was believed that this would have killed Wolverine, and this is the last time he crosses paths with Roughouse. It is unknown why Roughouse renews his partnership with Bloodscream, but as Bloodscream becomes increasingly cannibalistic it is unlikely Roughouse would have stayed with him. Roughouse, while a villain, still had some sense of honor and valued human life. Sure enough, the next time Wolverine encounters Bloodscream, Roughouse is no longer with him. He is instead replaced by the cannibalistic imbecile, Vermin. Roughouse is hired by a violent criminal named Kimura to guard a group of children. A colleague tries to bribe Roughouse so as to gain perverted access to the kids, Roughouse instantly murders the man, verbally proclaiming that allow kids to come to harm is something he will not tolerate. Kimura later leads her forces on a direct attack against the de facto leader of Madripoor, Tiger Tyger. This includes intentionally murdering dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.All-New Wolverine #16-18 (2017) Powers and abilities Roughouse possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of his unique heritage. Roughouse cannot be slain by any metal forged by mortal man. Roughouse is many times stronger than the average human. In Wolverine #123, Wolverine narrates that \\"He's not Hulk-level strength.\\" but is seen picking up a steamroller or forklift easily with one arm. This would put Roughhouse comparable to Colossus or Rogue. At that point Wolverine introduces into the story that Roughouse was descended from Rock Trolls. Like full blooded Rock Trolls, the various tissues of Roughouse's body have much greater density than those of ordinary humans (contributing somewhat to Roughouse's great strength and size). As a result, Roughouse's body is highly resistant to conventional injury. Roughouse's body can withstand temperature extremes, puncture wounds, impact trauma, and high caliber machine gun shells without being injured. Even though Roughouse can be injured, the force or weaponry required to do so would have to be considerably more powerful than most conventional materials. Roughouse's superhuman musculature produces far less lactic acid than the musculature of ordinary humans, granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities. =Special skills= Aside from his superhuman powers, Roughouse is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He utilizes mostly street fighting techniques that let him make full use of his great size and physical strength. He also has many connections throughout the criminal underworld, where he often hires himself out as a special enforcer.

In AD 61, a party of Roman soldiers sent by the Emperor Nero proceeded up the White Nile but were not able to get beyond the Sudd, which marked the limit of Roman penetration into equatorial Africa. For the same reasons in later times the search for the source of the Nile was particularly difficult; it eventually involved overland expeditions from the central African coast, so as to avoid having to travel through the Sudd. In 2019 a study suggested that increased water flows into the Sudd may be partly causing up to a third of the whole West African rise in atmospheric methane levels over the previous decade. Location The Sudd stretches from Mongalla to just outside the Sobat confluence with the White Nile just upstream of Malakal as well as westwards along the Bahr el Ghazal. The shallow and flat inland delta lies between 5.5 and 9.5 degrees latitude North and covers an area of south to north and east to west between Mongalla in the south and Malakal in the north. Its size is highly variable, averaging over . During the wet season it may extend to over comprising 13% of the country, depending on the inflowing waters, with the discharge from Lake Victoria being the main control factor of flood levels and area inundation. Since the Sudd area consists of various meandering channels, lagoons, reed and papyrus fields and loses half of its inflowing water through evapotranspiration in the permanent and seasonal floodplains, the complex hydrology has many primary and secondary effects. A major feature of the area, even if not completed and not functional, is the Jonglei Canal, planned to bypass waters from the Sudd to avoid evaporation losses and increase the amount of water discharged at the outlet of the Sudd. From 1961 to 1963, a great increase in the inundated area occurred when the level of Lake Victoria rose and the outflow increased. The total area of the Sudd is related to the amount of water reaching Bor from Albert Nile and from torrents or seasonal watercourses that can add substantial amounts to the flow in the upstream end of the Sudd. During the 1960s increase in Lake Victoria discharge, where flows at Mongalla roughly doubled, the flows at Malakal at the northern end of the swamps increased by 1.5 times the previous average flow. As a consequence of these high flows, the areas of permanent swamp and seasonal floodplains have, taken together, increased to 2.5 times their former size. The swamps have increased the most, and the seasonal floodplain is 1.5 times its previous size. From the southern inflow of the Bahr al Jabal (\\"Sea of the Mountain\\") at Mongalla, the defined riverbed successively widens into a floodplain, where the waters flow in meandering river stretches and various channels and lagoons throughout the dry season. With rising water levels it expands over the semi- flooded grasslands during the flood season. Slightly downstream of Bor, the Bahr el Zeraf (\\"Sea of the Giraffes\\") river branches off the Bahr al Jabal to the east, diverting part of the flow, and again joins the Bahr al Jabal just before reaching Malakal. During the course of its flow, the Bahr al Jabal passes Lake No, where the Bahr el Ghazal (\\"Sea of the Gazelles\\") connects to the Bahr al Jabal, contributing an inflow with seasonal variation. At Malakal, the Sobat River joins into the system. The combined flows then stream to the north as the White Nile in a defined bed, joining with the Blue Nile waters at Khartoum to form the main Nile. Sudd was designated as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance on 5 June 2006. An area of was designated. Climate Hydrologically the Sudd plays an important role in storing floodwaters and trapping sediments from the Bahr al Jabal. Roughly 55 percent of water entering the area is lost to evaporation. Water levels fluctuate by up to 1.5 metres, depending on the intensity of seasonal flooding. The region receives less rainfall (typically between 55 and 65 centimetres per year) than neighbouring areas at the same latitude. Orographic lifting on the eastern and western sides of the Sudd contribute to that condition.Zahran, A.B. 1986. Sudan Rainfall Variability ‚Äì Towards a Drought Assessment Model. Interna. Confer. on water Resources Needs & Planning in Drought Prone Areas, 85-106 Geomorphology The morphology of the area is defined by the channel and lagoon system of the permanent Sudd swamps, the adjacent flood plains and the surrounding flat terrain. The Bahr al Jabal runs to the north-northwest and therefore in an angle to the gradient of the flood plain, which slopes down to the north, while north of Juba the river flows in an incised trough. The banks of this trough decrease in height from south to north with the Bahr al Jabal approaching Bor and ending in the Sudd flood plain just north of Bor on the eastern bank and towards Shambe on the western bank. In the southern part, the river meanders from side to side in the restraining trough in one or more channels, but further north the swamp is not limited by higher ground and the system of river channels becomes increasingly complex. The characteristics of the river with its network of channels and lagoons are distinguishable in satellite imagery and digital elevation models. The geology of the area is defined by heavy clay soils, highly impermeable with a top layer of \\"black cotton\\" vertisol of approximately 500 mm on average. Sandy soils are found only at depths of approximately and below, as determined by well drilling profiles (Petersen, 2008). This indicates a very limited groundwater influence on the area's hydrology. Population Dinka, Nuer and Shilluk pastoralists use the Sudd and the surrounding areas extensively. Livestock and rain-fed agriculture are the dominant means of support for the largely rural population for which the seasonal flooded grasslands along the Sudd provides valuable grazing lands. Vegetation and ecosystem Vegetation cover of the area can generally be classified in five categories which depend on the elevation of the area above river flood level: the lakes and rivers themselves, the floating plant life of the swamp, river-flooded grasslands (Toic), rain- flooded grasslands, and wooded grasslands on the fringes. Grassland and woodland areas have been cultivated by local populations. The density of the grasslands along the Sudd changes with the season, with tall grass in the rainy season and short dry grass in the dry season, when frequent fires also occur. The fluvial area is mostly overgrown with vegetation, with some main and side channels as well as lagoons of open water. The vegetation distribution is described in further detail in Sutcliffe (1974) and Petersen (2007). The main species are: * Phragmites communis (shallow flooded, buried roots) * Echinochloa pyramidalis (shallow flooded, buried roots) * Oryza barthii (shallow flooded, buried roots) * Echinochloa stagnina (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots) * Vossia cuspidata (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots) * Cyperus papyrus (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots) * Typha domingensis The first three species are anchored so their distribution is limited to the depth of flooding. For the last species their root system needs to be permanently in water or saturated soil, which is a good indicator of flood patterns. P. communis, E. pyramidalis and O. barthii for example dominate only in areas where the depth of flooding does not exceed 130 cm over a period of ten years or 118 cm for one month in the year. Floating vegetation of C. papyrus had caused blockages in the Sudd swamps on a number of occasions between 1879 and 1900, when the plants were torn out by increased flooding. C. papyrus needs saturated conditions and can tolerate flooding that is not more than 150 cm deep. When the matted vegetation breaks free of its moorings, it forms floating islands of vegetation up to 30 km in length. Such islands, in varying stages of decomposition, eventually break up. Historically, the fully floating Nile cabbage (Pistia stratiotes) was an important plant in the Sudd, but it has largely been replaced by the invasive water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). The sluggish waters are host to a large population of mosquitoes and parasites that cause waterborne diseases. The early explorers searching for the source of the Nile experienced considerable difficulties, sometimes taking months to get through the Sudd. In his 1972 book The White Nile, Alan Moorehead says of the Sudd, \\"there is no more formidable swamp in the world\\". =Fauna= Fish Including several diverse aquatic habitats like swamps, lakes, channels and floodplains, the Sudd is rich in fish. Some 70 species have been recorded and this mostly involves fish that are found in much of the Nile system such as marbled lungfish, Senegal bichir, African arowana, Mormyrus caschive, Nile carp, Nile tilapia, mango tilapia, redbelly tilapia, Nile perch, Distichodus rostratus, elongate tigerfish, African tetras, African sharptooth catfish, Synodontis frontosus, S. schall and others. Among the few endemics of the Sudd system are Clarias engelseni, Enteromius yeiensis, Nothobranchius nubaensis, N. virgatus and two apparently undescribed species of Enteromius, and the fish fauna in significant sections still has not been properly studied.  Birds, crocodilians, and mammals  Over 400 species of bird are found in the Sudd, including shoebills (a stronghold for the species with several thousand individuals), great white pelicans, and black crowned cranes. The Sudd provides food and water to large populations of migrating birds. As the surrounding landscape is a large swath of dry Sahel across Africa, the swamp is also a haven for migrating mammals, especially antelopes, such as the bohor reedbuck, sitatunga (the most aquatic antelope of the Sudd, mostly inhabiting permanent swampland), the endangered Nile lechwe (not in permanent swampland, but generally near the water's edge and often walking in shallow water), and the white-eared kob (further away from the permanent swampland). White-eared kob, tiang and Mongalla gazelle take part in one of the largest mammal migrations on Earth, numbering about 1.2 million individuals in total. Jan 2007Furniss, C. (2010) Geographical, April 2010. The shallow water is frequented by Nile crocodiles and hippopotamuses. In more upland areas the Sudd was known as an historic habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog, which however may have been exterminated in the region.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Threats and preservation The long-running civil war in Southern Sudan seriously disrupted conservation efforts in the Sudd, especially as the widespread availability of weapons has encouraged wildlife poaching, including of elephants. There are three game reserves: Zeraf Island between the Zeraf River and the Nile, Shambe Reserve, and Mongalla Game Reserve. The vast swamp area can be converted in to fresh water flooded forest by planting productive tree species with commercial value from the Amazon flooded forests without altering its native flora and fauna. Jonglei diversion canal Because of the Sudd swamp, the water from the southwestern tributaries (the Bahr el Ghazal system) for all practical purposes does not reach the main river and is lost through evaporation and transpiration. Sir William Garstin, Undersecretary of State of Public Works of Egypt, created the first detailed proposal for digging a canal east of the Sudd in 1907. By bypassing the swamps, evaporation of the Nile's water would vastly decrease, allowing an increase in the area of cultivatable land in Egypt by . Hydrogeologists in the 1930s proposed digging a canal east of the Sudd to divert water from the Bahr al Jabal above the Sudd to a point farther down the White Nile, bypassing the swamps and carrying the White Nile's water directly to the main channel of the river.\\"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\\", October 1933, Popular Science, short article on top-right of page with map The Jonglei canal scheme was first studied by the government of Egypt in 1946 and plans were developed in 1954‚Äì59. Construction work on the canal began in 1978 but the outbreak of political instability in Sudan has held up work for many years. By 1984 when the Southern Sudanese rebels (SPLA) brought the works to a halt, 240 km of the canal of a total of 360 km had been excavated. The rusting remains of the giant German-built excavation machine‚Äîvariously nicknamed either \\"Sarah\\" or \\"Lucy\\"‚Äîare visible on a Google Earth image at the south end of the canal.Google Earth image It was destroyed by a missile. When peace was restored in 2000, speculation grew about a restart of the project. However, on 21 February 2008, the Sudanese government said the revival of the project was not a priority. Nevertheless, in 2008, Sudan and Egypt agreed to restart the project and finish the canal in 24 years.Ahmad, A.M. (2008) Post-Jonglei planning in southern Sudan: combining environment with development Environment and Urbanization, October 2008 South Sudan gained independence in 2011. It is estimated that the Jonglei canal project would produce 3.5‚Äì4.8 x 109 m3 of water per year (equal to a mean annual discharge of 110‚Äì152 m3/s (3 883‚Äì5 368 ft3/s), an increase of around five to seven per cent of Egypt's current water supply. The canal's benefits would be shared by Egypt and Sudan, with the expected damage falling on South Sudan. The complex environmental and social issues involved, including the collapse of fisheries, drying of grazing lands, a drop of groundwater levels, and a reduction of rainfall in the region,De Villiers, Marq, 2001. Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource. Mariner Books. may limit the scope of the project in practical terms. The draining of the Sudd is likely to have environmental effects comparable to the drying of Lake Chad or the draining of the Aral Sea.

The character is usually depicted as an enemy of Wolverine. Publication history Bloodscream's first appearance was in Wolverine vol. 2 #4 (February, 1989), and he was created by Chris Claremont and John Buscema. Fictional character biography Bloodscream is a being with traits and abilities that are similar to those of vampires, though he himself is not a vampire. Bloodscream was born in England in the 16th century. In his youth, he served as an apprentice to an unknown doctor before adulthood, in the manner typical of the Tudor period. He later served in Sir Francis Drake's pirate fleet as a naval surgeon between 1577 and 1580. In 1580, the surgeon is mortally wounded during an attack on a Spanish galleon and Drake personally directs him to be treated by a Native American shaman named Dagoo. The shaman, however, is actually a necromancer and is only able to save his life by transforming him into a vampire-like being. Enraged by his new condition, Bloodscream forces Dagoo to reveal the ingredients of the potion that had saved him and how to reverse the effects. Before he kills Dagoo, the necromancer reveals that the effects will only be reversed if the potion contains the blood of a man who doesn't age. Most of his activities over the centuries aren't known, with the exception that he continuously fights in any war he can, as Dagoo told him that was where he might find an immortal. During the 20th century, he serves as a soldier in the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. He sees action during World War II and first encountered the man then known only as Logan, who would later become Wolverine, during the Battle of Normandy (June 6 - August 25, 1944), when Wolverine is a corporal of the Canadian Forces. The two engage in a brief battle with Bloodscream being stabbed and left for dead. He runs into Wolverine decades later in Madripoor and notices that Wolverine hasn't aged since his encounter with him decades earlier. This leaves Bloodscream to believe that Wolverine's blood will work in the formula to transform him back into a human. He properly introduces himself to Wolverine while working in Madripoor as a criminal enforcer with his partner, Roughouse. During this time, he often comes into conflict with Wolverine, who was at the time in his alter-ego as \\"Patch\\", though he's never able to defeat him. He nearly kills one of Wolverine's close friends, Archie Corrigan, managing to scar his chest with a handprint before being interrupted. After he parts company with Roughouse, Bloodscream enters a partnership with Cylla Markham of the Reavers, who at that point is tracking Wolverine for reasons of her own. He joins her in tracking Wolverine all throughout the high Canadian wilderness and they finally locate him, though both he and Cylla are near death from hunger and fatigue. Knowing he has no chance against Wolverine unless he's at his peak, Bloodscream turns on Cylla and drains her of blood. Bloodscream then confronts Wolverine, who is armed with the honor sword of Clan Yashida. The sword is a katana forged by demon blacksmiths from a fallen meteorite. As the sword wasn't forged by mortal man, Bloodscream is vulnerable to it and is struck down by Wolverine, who again leaves him for dead. However, Bloodscream later reappears, and revives the androids Albert and Elsie-Dee, hoping to use them to locate Wolverine. Bloodscream later begins working as a mercenary again with Roughouse, the two being hired by villain the Black Tarantula for a time before being defeated and captured by Spider-Man- although they were unaware of this as Spider-Man fought them using his four new identities- exchanging knowledge of the Tarantula's plans for their freedom. He encounters Wolverine a few more times and has recently been involved in a confrontation with Iron Man in which he was beaten. Iron Man stabbed him with a blade in his armour normally used to interface with outside systems. Maintaining Bloodscream's inability to be hurt with mortally forged weapons, this blade was created by a Stark Enterprises engineering robot rather than a man. Recently, Bloodscream and Roughouse have come into employment by HYDRA. They came into conflict with the Shadow Initiative. Already beheaded by Typhoid Mary, Bloodscream is defeated by the appearance of Ant-Man, who destroys Bloodscream's body by growing inside of it. However, Ant-Man states Bloodscream would have pulled himself back together, thus urging the Shadow Initiative to evacuate the HYDRA headquarters. Powers and abilities Bloodscream possesses a variety of superhuman abilities that are reminiscent of those possessed by supernatural vampires, even though he himself is not a true vampire. He possesses none of the supernatural or mystical vulnerabilities common to true vampires. He suffers no harm from sunlight, silver, or any other traditional weakness from folklore. Like true vampires, however, Bloodscream possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reaction time. The full limits of Bloodscream's physical capabilities are unknown but are well beyond those of most known true vampires. Bloodscream must regularly feed from the blood or the lifeforce of other human beings in order to maintain his physical vitality. There are times in which he merely ingests blood and there are others when he drains an individual of his or her life energy. He is able to accomplish either by touching a victim's bare skin. If a victim survives, the victim is left with a red scar in the shape of Bloodscream's hand at the exact point where he touches a victim. It also can result, if Bloodscream chooses to absorb a victim's entire lifeforce, in the victim's body quickly withering into rapidly aged husk. Bloodscream is able to transform a dead victim into a mindless, zombie-like being that is forced to do his bidding, though he rarely does so. Bloodscream is functionally immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging and to all known diseases. He has also shown the ability to rapidly heal from physical injury and to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissues, similar to Wolverine's mutant healing factor. Bloodscream has, in the past, reattached his own head after being decapitated by Wolverine. According to the necromancer who transformed him into his current form, Bloodscream cannot be slain by any weapon created by a mortal being, though it is unknown this is true or not. It is known that he can at least be injured by weapons created by mortal hands, and Iron Man once managed to seriously injure him with a blade function in his armor that had been created by a Stark Industries robot rather than a living being. Bloodscream also possesses limited shape-shifting powers, able to transform from his 'normal' pale-skinned vampire likeness into a more monstrous form. His jaw expands to several feet deep, and his teeth grow to almost a foot long. Bloodscream's arms, hands, and fingers also elongate, with his fingernails growing out to a similar length as his teeth. In this state, Bloodscream is little more than an animal and his craving for blood reaches frenzied levels. =Special skills= Bloodscream is a good hand-to-hand combatant and has many connections throughout the criminal underworld, adding to his reputation as a mercenary for hire. His extended lifespan has granted him great experience in matters of naval warfare and piracy. In other media =Television= * Bloodscream had a cameo in episode of the X-Men series along with Roughouse just as with the first ongoing Wolverine comic series. =Video games= * Bloodscream appears as a boss in Wolverine: Adamantium Rage. * Though he is not seen in the game, Bloodscream is briefly mentioned as having been murdered by a cult group called \\"The Circle of Eight\\" in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance.

It is a large plateau formation at an elevation of and is the highest peak in the Rh√∂n Mountains. Great advances in sailplane development took place on the mountain during the interwar period, driven by annual contests. Near the summit there is still an airfield used by gliding clubs and pilots of light aircraft.  Etymology  The German name is derived from Wasenkuppe, Asenberg or Weideberg and means Pasture mountain.  Geography  The Wasserkuppe lies in the administrative district Fulda north of Gersfeld. Other villages nearby are Poppenhausen ( west - south west) and W√ºstensachsen ( east, part of Ehrenberg, Hesse). It is part of the Rh√∂n Biosphere Reserve. The Wasserkuppe sources the spring of the river Fulda (the western source of the Weser) and the river L√ºtter which joins the Fulda after . The other peaks near the Wasserkuppe are Abtsrodaer Kuppe (north, NN), (east, NN) and Pferdskopf (south west, NN).  Aeronautical development Students from the Darmstadt University of Technology, then known as Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, began flying gliders from the Wasserkuppe as early as 1911, but interest in gliding in Germany increased greatly after 1918 when the Treaty of Versailles restricted the production or use of powered aircraft in the nation. From 1920 onwards, annual gliding competitions were held, leading to records being set and broken for height, distance and duration of unpowered flight. In 1922 became the first glider pilot to use an updraft rising along a mountain slope to stay aloft for a lengthy period.Deutsches Museum web-site He then founded the world's first glider pilot school at the Wasserkuppe. The first competition was organised by Oskar Ursinus,Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, who also built the first clubhouse on the Wasserkuppe in 1924 to replace the shipping containers that enthusiasts were using as accommodation up to that point. By 1930, the competition had become an international event, drawing pilots from all over Europe and even the United States. Also in 1924 'Rh√∂nvater' (Rh√∂n father) Oskar Ursinus convinced the then secretary of air transport for the ministry of transportation to turn the new gliding club into a state funded research organization. This started the Rh√∂n-Rossitten Gesellschaft and as a result, the Wasserkuppe now had a gliding school, workshops for building gliders and a funded research facility. Alexander Lippisch was appointed as the managing director of the new society. Virtually every German aeronautical engineer and test pilot of note during the 1920s and 1930s spent time building, testing, and flying aircraft at the Wasserkuppe, including the G√ºnter brothers, Wolf Hirth, the Horten brothers, Robert Kronfeld, Hans Jacobs, Heini Dittmar, Alexander Lippisch, Willy Messerschmitt, Hanna Reitsch, Peter Riedel, and Alexander Schleicher. Beverley Shenstone, who was later a key part of the design team for the Spitfire, flew gliders at Wasserkuppe in 1930. This period saw great advances in new technologies such as flying wings and rocket-powered flights. The \\"Ehrenhalle\\" in the Lilienthal Haus on the Wasserkuppe. In the 1930s the \\"Ehrenhalle\\" (Hall of Honor) was constructed in the Lilienthal Haus, with heavy bronze doors opening into a large hall with a stained glass window. The centerpiece is a larger-than-life bronze figure of Otto Lilienthal lying on an (empty) tomb. It is a memorial to all pilots who have died in aviation accidents. The inscription on the memorial is Lilienthal's famous last words: \\"Opfer m√ºssen gebracht werden\\" roughly meaning: \\"Sacrifices must be made.\\" During the Third Reich, gliding activities became largely controlled by the state, and for Hitler Youth pilots and their instructors, proficiency in gliding was viewed as the first step towards the Luftwaffe. Sailplane research was also nationalised under the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Segelflug (DFS ‚Äî German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight). Following World War II, a US Air Force base, radar station, and surveillance station were established there but when restrictions on German aviation were lifted in 1951, gliding soon returned to the Wasserkuppe where it has remained popular since. Beginning in the 1970s, the newer sport of hang gliding has also found a home there. Following the reunification of Germany and demise of the Soviet Union, the surveillance and radar installations were removed in the 1990s. The new exhibit hall in the Deutsches Segelflugmuseum (German Sailplane Museum). Commemorative Stamp In 1970, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first competition, the Deutsches Segelflugmuseum (German Sailplane Museum) was opened on the plateau, with Neil Armstrong a guest of honour at the ceremony. The museum gained a new building in 1987. The Wasserkuppe is also the home of the Oldtimer Segelflugclub (OSC ‚Äì Oldtimer Gliding Club), dedicated (as its name suggests) to flying vintage sailplanes. Next to the long tradition of sailplanes the Wasserkuppe has become a sports and weekend centre offering a wide selection of activities. Paragliding as well as Snowkiting is offered. In winter the area is used by skiers and snowboarders.

( ; , lit. Hongqi Corporation Ltd.) is a Taiwanese multinational hardware and electronics corporation specializing in advanced electronics technology, headquartered in Xizhi, New Taipei City. Its products include desktop PCs, laptop PCs (clamshells, 2-in-1s, convertibles and Chromebooks), tablets, servers, storage devices, virtual reality devices, displays, smartphones and peripherals, as well as gaming PCs and accessories under its Predator brand. In the early 2000s, Acer implemented a new business model, shifting from a manufacturer to a designer, marketer and distributor of products, while performing production processes via contract manufacturers.Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, Bart Sleb, 2005 As of July 2020, Acer is the fifth-largest personal computer vendor in the world. Currently, in addition to its core IT products business, Acer also has a new business entity that focuses on the integration of cloud services and platforms, and the development of smartphones and wearable devices with value-added IoT applications. History Acer was founded in 1976 by Stan Shih (ÊñΩÊåØÊ¶Æ), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and five others as Multitech in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the Micro- Professor MPF-I training kit, then two Apple II clones‚Äìthe Microprofessor II and III‚Äìbefore joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987. In 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales versus contract manufacturing businesses, the company spun off the contract business in 2000, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001, the company sold its manufacturing units BenQ and Wistron in order to focus resources on design and sales. Acer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003 to US$11.31 billion in 2006. Acer's North American market share has slipped over the past few years, while its European market share has risen. In the mid-2000s, consumer notebooks were almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer's exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend. Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007, Acer bought Gateway in the United States and Packard Bell in Europe, and became the third largest provider of computers and the second largest for notebooks, achieving significant improvement in profitability. Acer has strived to become the world's largest PC vendor in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin. However, such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed. 2013 re-organisation In November 2013, chairman and CEO J.T. Wang and president Jim Wong both resigned due to the company's poor financial performance. Wang had been reportedly due to leave Acer at the end of the year, and was supposed to have been succeeded by Wong. Acer co-founder Stan Shih took over as board chairman and interim president after the departure of Wang and Wong, and began to search for new candidates to assume the roles of CEO and president.

All of Acer's tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification.ISO 14001 was released in 1996 with the intent that companies manage all of the activities, products, and services that can significantly impact the environment In November 2012, Acer was ranked 4th place out of 15 in Greenpeace's re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with a score of 5.1 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the products criteria receiving no points on product lifecycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points. It received some praise for launching new products which are free from polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first-tier suppliers and investigating its second tier. In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Acer the seventh highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.

Swan upping is an annual ceremony in England in which mute swans on the River Thames are rounded up, caught, ringed, and then released. History By prerogative right, the British Crown enjoys ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water. Rights over swans may, however, be granted to a subject by the Crown (accordingly they may also be claimed by prescription.) The Case of Swans (1592) 7 Co. Rep. 15b The ownership of swans in a given body of water was commonly granted to landowners up to the 16th century. The only bodies still to exercise such rights are two livery companies of the City of London. Thus the ownership of swans in the Thames is shared equally among the Crown, the Vintners' Company and the Dyers' Company. Description Swan upping is the traditional means by which the swans on the Thames are apportioned among the three proprietors. Its main practical purposes today are to conduct a census of swans and check their health. It occurs annually in the third week of July. Over five days, the Queen's, Vintners' and the Dyers' respective swan uppers row up the river in skiffs in recent centuries from Sunbury-on-Thames to Abingdon on Thames. Swans caught by the Queen's swan uppers under the direction of the Swan Marker are left unmarked, except for a lightweight ring linked to the database of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). Those caught by the Dyers and Vintners receive a similar ring on the other leg. Originally, rather than being ringed, swans' bills would be nicked using a metal implement, a practice reflected in the pub name The Swan with Two Necks in the City connected with the Vintners, a corruption of \\"The Swan with Two Nicks\\". On 20 July 2009, Queen Elizabeth II, as \\"Seigneur of the Swans,\\" attended the Swan Upping ceremony for the first time in her reign. This was the first time that the monarch had personally watched the ceremony in centuries. Cancellations In 2012, exceptional high river flows for summer prompted a partial cancellation: between Sunbury-on- Thames and Windsor, the first definitively known cancellation (albeit partial) in its 900-year history. The first known full cancellation took place in 2020 due to Covid-19 social distancing measures.

He is best known for his book-length narrative poem of the American Civil War, John Brown's Body (1928), for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, and for the short stories \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" (1936) and \\"By the Waters of Babylon\\" (1937). In 2009, The Library of America selected his story \\"The King of the Cats\\" (1929) for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales edited by Peter Straub. Life and career =Early life= Ben√©t was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to James Walker Ben√©t, a colonel in the United States Army. His grandfather and namesake led the Army Ordnance Corps from 1874 to 1891 as a brigadier general and served in the Civil War. His paternal uncle Laurence Vincent Ben√©t was an ensign in the United States Navy during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and later manufactured the French-Hotchkiss machine gun. At around the age of ten, Ben√©t was sent to the Hitchcock Military Academy. He graduated from Summerville Academy in Augusta, Georgia and from Yale University, where he was \\"the power behind the Yale Lit\\", according to Thornton Wilder, a fellow member of the Elizabethan Club. He also edited and contributed light verse to the campus humor magazine The Yale Record.Bronson, Francis W., Thomas Caldecott Chubb, and Cyril Hume, eds. (1922) The Yale Record Book of Verse: 1872-1922. New Haven: Yale University Press. pp. 16‚Äì17, 24, 42‚Äì43, 50‚Äì51, 67‚Äì68, 82‚Äì83. His first book was published when he was aged 17 and he was awarded an M.A. in English upon submission of his third volume of poetry in lieu of a thesis.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Vol. 12, Micropaedia, 15th edition, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc. c. 1989 He was also a part-time contributor to Time magazine in its early years. In 1920-21, Ben√©t went to France on a Yale traveling fellowship, where he met Rosemary Carr; the couple married in Chicago in November 1921. Carr was also a writer and poet, and they collaborated on some works. In 1926, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship award and while living in Paris, wrote John Brown's Body. =Man of letters= Ben√©t helped solidify the place of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition and the Yale University Press during his decade-long judgeship of the competition.Bradley, George. The Yale Younger Poets Anthology, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, pp. 23‚Äì53 He published the first volumes of James Agee, Muriel Rukeyser, Jeremy Ingalls, and Margaret Walker. He was elected a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1929, and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1931. Ben√©t won the O. Henry Award on three occasions, for his short stories An End to Dreams in 1932, The Devil and Daniel Webster in 1937, and Freedom's a Hard-Bought Thing in 1940. He adapted his fantasy short story \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" as a play, The Devil and Daniel Webster: A Play in One Act (New York: Dramatists Play Service, 1938), and also as a folk opera, The Devil and Daniel Webster: An Opera in One Act (New York: Farrar & Rinehart, 1939), with music by Douglas Moore. The story was filmed, for which he co-wrote the screenplay adaptation, but originally released as All That Money Can Buy (1941). Ben√©t also wrote the sequel \\"Daniel Webster and the Sea Serpent\\", in which Daniel Webster encounters Leviathan. =Death and legacy= Evergreen Cemetery, Stephen Vincent Ben√©t Ben√©t died of a heart attack in New York City on March 13, 1943 at age 44. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Stonington, Connecticut, where he had owned the historic Amos Palmer House. On April 17, 1943, NBC broadcast a special tribute to his life and works which included a performance by Helen Hayes. He was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for Western Star, an unfinished narrative poem on the settling of the United States. Ben√©t adapted the Roman myth of the rape of the Sabine Women into the story \\"The Sobbin' Women\\". It was adapted as the movie musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954). His play John Brown's Body was staged on Broadway in 1953 in a three-person dramatic reading featuring Tyrone Power, Judith Anderson, and Raymond Massey, directed by Charles Laughton.

This white crystalline compound is highly soluble in water and polar organic solvents. It has a cage-like structure similar to adamantane. It is useful in the synthesis of other organic compounds, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, and rubber additives. It sublimes in vacuum at 280 ¬∞C. Synthesis, structure, reactivity Hexamethylenetetramine was discovered by Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859. In this paper, Butlerov discovered formaldehyde, which he called \\"Dioxymethylen\\" (methylene dioxide) [page 247] because his empirical formula for it was incorrect (C4H4O4). On pages 249‚Äì250, he describes treating formaldehyde with ammonia gas, creating hexamine. It is prepared industrially by combining formaldehyde and ammonia. The reaction can be conducted in gas phase and in solution. center The molecule has a symmetric tetrahedral cage- like structure, similar to adamantane, whose four \\"corners\\" are nitrogen atoms and \\"edges\\" are methylene bridges. Although the molecular shape defines a cage, no void space is available at the interior for binding other atoms or molecules, unlike crown ethers or larger cryptand structures. The molecule behaves like an amine base, undergoing protonation and N-alkylation (e.g. Quaternium-15). Applications The dominant use of hexamethylenetetramine is in the production of powdery or liquid preparations of phenolic resins and phenolic resin moulding compounds, where it is added as a hardening component. These products are used as binders, e.g. in brake and clutch linings, abrasive products, non-woven textiles, formed parts produced by moulding processes, and fireproof materials. It has been proposed that hexamethylenetetramine could work as a molecular building block for self-assembled molecular crystals. =Medical uses= As the mandelic acid salt (generic methenamine mandelate, USP) it is used for the treatment of urinary tract infection. It decomposes at an acidic pH to form formaldehyde and ammonia, and the formaldehyde is bactericidal; the mandelic acid adds to this effect. Urinary acidity is typically ensured by co-administering vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or ammonium chloride. Its use had temporarily been reduced in the late 1990s, due to adverse effects, particularly chemically-induced hemorrhagic cystitis in overdose, but its use has now been re-approved because of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance to more commonly used drugs. This drug is particularly suitable for long-term prophylactic treatment of urinary tract infection, because bacteria do not develop resistance to formaldehyde. It should not be used in the presence of chronic kidney disease. Methenamine in the form of cream and spray is successfully used for treatment of excessive sweating and concomitant odor. =Histological stains= Methenamine silver stains are used for staining in histology, including the following types: *Grocott's methenamine silver stain, used widely as a screen for fungal organisms. *Jones' stain, a methenamine silver-Periodic acid-Schiff that stains for basement membrane, availing to view the \\"spiked\\" Glomerular basement membrane associated with membranous glomerulonephritis. =Solid fuel= Together with 1,3,5-trioxane, hexamethylenetetramine is a component of hexamine fuel tablets used by campers, hobbyists, the military and relief organizations for heating camping food or military rations. It burns smokelessly, has a high energy density of 30.0 megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg), does not liquify while burning, and leaves no ashes, although its fumes are toxic. Standardized 0.149 g tablets of methenamine (hexamine) are used by fire-protection laboratories as a clean and reproducible fire source to test the flammability of carpets and rugs. =Food additive= Hexamethylene tetramine or hexamine is also used as a food additive as a preservative (INS number 239). It is approved for usage for this purpose in the EU,UK Food Standards Agency: where it is listed under E number E239, however it is not approved in the USA, Russia, Australia, or New Zealand.Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code =Reagent in organic chemistry= Hexamethylenetetramine is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. It is used in the Duff reaction (formylation of arenes), the Sommelet reaction (converting benzyl halides to aldehydes), and in the Delepine reaction (synthesis of amines from alkyl halides). =Explosives= Hexamethylenetetramine is the base component to produce RDX and, consequently, C-4 as well as Octogen, hexamine dinitrate, hexamine diperchlorate and HMTD.  Historical uses  Hexamethylenetetramine was first introduced into the medical setting in 1899 as a urinary antiseptic. However, it was only used in cases of acidic urine, whereas boric acid was used to treat urinary tract infections with alkaline urine. Scientist De Eds found that there was a direct correlation between the acidity of hexamethylenetetramine's environment and the rate of its decomposition. Therefore, its effectiveness as a drug depended greatly on the acidity of the urine rather than the amount of the drug administered. In an alkaline environment, hexamethylenetetramine was found to be almost completely inactive. Hexamethylenetetramine was also used as a method of treatment for soldiers exposed to phosgene in World War I. Subsequent studies have shown that large doses of hexamethylenetetramine provide some protection if taken before phosgene exposure but none if taken afterwards. Producers Since 1990 the number of European producers has been declining. The French SNPE factory closed in 1990; in 1993, the production of hexamethylenetetramine in Leuna, Germany ceased; in 1996, the Italian facility of Agrolinz closed down; in 2001, the UK producer Borden closed; in 2006, production at Chemko, Slovak Republic, was closed. Remaining producers include INEOS in Germany, Caldic in the Netherlands, and Hexion in Italy. In the US, Eli Lilly and Company stopped producing methenamine tablets in 2002.Alan H. Schoen (2004), Re: Equialence of methenamine Tablets Standard for Flammability of Carpets and Rugs . U.S. Consumer product Safety Commission, Washington, DC, July 29, 2004. Many other countries who still produce this include Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Australia. In Australia, Hexamine Tablets for fuel are made by Thales Australia Ltd. In M√©xico, Hexamine is produced by Abiya.

It is connected via passageway to its neighbour, The Excelsior. The complex was developed by Jardines through its property development arm, Hongkong Land. It was later sold to Sun Hung Kai Properties. It is situated on land owned by Jardine since the early days of Hong Kong as a British Crown Colony at East Point, where Jardine had their original godowns and offices. History Located at No. 280 Gloucester Road, World Trade Centre was built in 1975. Although it originally housed the nightclub Palace Theatre (), it was later remodeled to be Hong Kong's most luxurious cinema of the same name. The food and beverage corporation Maxim's also established a restaurant branch in the building, and garnered relative fame at the time. In 1990, World Trade Centre Group Ltd (formerly Bond Corporation International Ltd) purchased the building from Hongkong Land for HK$1.72 billion. The World Trade Centre was later sold to Sun Hung Kai Properties and was remodelled again to its present form, with the lower floors as a mall and the upper floors remaining as office space.

Also, the working hours were extended and World Trade Centre renamed as WTC. The first phase of shopping arcade renovation started in October 2006. The floors built on this phase were shops and also office areas and a big exhibition hall on 13th floor. Food & Beverage outlets opened in January 2008 include Hea Place (9/F), Ruby Tuesday, Kung Tak Lam Shanghai Vegetarian Cuisine(10/F), Shanghai Lu Yang Cun Restaurant (11/F), Dragon King Restaurant (12/F), Myung Ga Korean Restaurant and Kiriyaki (13/F)„ÄÇ In February 2009 another renovation phase was held, which made multi-floor shops possible, thereafter the agn√®s b. store is located on 1st and 2nd floor, Muji and Uniqlo on 4th and 5th floor and Seaview Restaurant and mYoga yoga center on other floors.

The cinema was regarded as one of the most extravagant in Hong Kong; whereas normal prime seats would cost 10 Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), the cheapest seat in Palace Theatre costs 12 HKD. The 1060 larger and wider seats, the luxurious lobby, and the middle to upper class clientele signalled the birth of high-end cinemas for Hong Kong movie-goers. The films shown were primarily from the West; the first film was Aliens. In 1981, Palace Theatre showed Somewhere in Time starring Christopher Reeve, which remained in cinemas for 223 days, a record length for Hong Kong at the time. Between the period of 12 September 1981 and 22 April 1982, the box office at Palace Jade made 9.38 million HKD, also establishing a new record for foreign movies.Apple Daily, 12 October 2004 Among other films, Palace Jade showed American Gigolo and A Clockwork Orange exclusively.

He was the Project Director in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at Koderma. He was murdered in Gaya, Bihar after fighting corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral highway construction project. Early life Satyendra Dubey, the son of Bageshwari Dubey and Phulamati Devi, was born at the village of Sahpur near Pratappur Sugar Factory in the Siwan district of Bihar, India. The family of 7 children, five girls and two boys, subsisted on a small piece of land, and Bageshwari also held a low-paying clerical position in a nearby sugar mill. Until the age of 15 he studied at the Ganga Box Kanodiya High School in Shahpur and then joined junior college at Allahabad, about three hundred kilometres away. Satyendra was the topper of the state in 10th and 12th board exams. He gained admission to the Civil Engineering Department of IIT Kanpur in 1990 and graduated in 1994. He would subsequently complete his M. Tech (Civil Engg.) from the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (now Indian Institute of Technology, BHU) in 1996. Professional life After his masters, Satyendra joined the Indian Engineering Service (IES) and in July 2002, went on deputation to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Dubey became the Project Director at Koderma, Jharkhand, responsible for managing a part of the Aurangabad-Barachatti section of National Highway 2 (The Grand Trunk Road). This highway was part of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) Corridor Project, the Prime Minister's initiative, which aimed to connect many of the country's major cities by four-lane limited- access highways totalling 14,000 km, at an overall cost more than US$10 billion. During this period, Dubey got the contractor of the project to suspend three of his engineers after exposing serious financial irregularities. At one point, he had the contractor rebuild six kilometres of under-quality road, a huge loss for the road contract mafia. Murder and aftermath On 27 November 2003, Dubey was returning from a wedding in Varanasi, and called his driver to meet him at the station. He reached Gaya railway station at three in the morning, and found that the car was not able to come because of a battery malfunction. It appears that at this point Dubey decided to take a rickshaw home. When he didn‚Äôt reach home, his driver went to look for him and found him dead by the side of the road in the suburb of A.P. Colony. He had been shot. The news ignited tremendous public hue and cry. The matter was raised in Parliament, and the Prime Minister shifted the onus of investigation from the Bihar Police (who might themselves be implicated) to the CBI.\\"Veejaypee demands murder enquiry\\" BBC 10 December 2003 The CBI registered a case against unknown persons under 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code and various provision under the Arms Act on 14 December 2003. =The investigation= In early investigations, the CBI interrogated the rickshaw puller Pradeep Kumar who was caught using Dubey's stolen cell phone. The mobile phone had been switched off for about a fortnight after the murder, but then Kumar called his 'second wife' in Kolkata, following which the CBI traced the rickshaw puller to his slum in Gaya. Although Kumar had a criminal history in similar cases of robbery, it appears he was released after interrogation, and could not be traced a month later. Two other suspects, Sheonath Sah and Mukendra Paswan, were questioned by the CBI. They were found dead from poisoning on 1 February 2004, within 25 hours of the CBI questioning. Sah's father lodged an FIR against the CBI with the Bihar Police, but CBI Director Uma Shanker Mishra called their deaths a suicide in a press meeting a few days later.\\"Suicides in Indian Murder Case\\" BBC 2 February 2004 The CBI later arrested four persons, Uday Mallah, Mantu Kumar, Tutu Kumar and Babloo, all belonging to Katari village of Gaya on 6 June 2004. On 13 June, the CBI arrested another accused Sarvan Paswan.press release CBI 14 June 2004 In conclusion of its investigations, CBI arraigned four persons on 3 September 2004. Based on testimony by Pradeep Kumar, who was his rickshaw puller, the event was presented as an attempted robbery. Because Satyendra put up a fight about giving up his briefcase, he was shot. The person accused of actually shooting Dubey with a country-made pistol was Mantu Kumar, son of Lachhu Singh, of Village Katari, Gaya district. Accomplices with him included Uday Kumar, Pinku Ravidas and Shravan Kumar. Mantu Kumar was arrested from near his home in Panchayatee khada in Gaya. He had apparently been living in Gaya town and working as a rickshawpuller. On 19 September 2005, while the case was being heard in Patna, Bihar in the court of Addl. Session Judge, J M Sharma, Mantu Kumar escaped from the court premises, leading to widespread allegations of police complicity. While Mantu was being held at the high security Beur Jail, the invigilation can be lax during such court appearances, and it is a common tactic of the mafia to organise a few policemen to make it possible for the criminal to escape. It was felt that the escape was engineered by higher-ups who may have executed the murder through Mantu Kumar. The CBI announced a cash reward of Rs. 100,000 for apprehending Mantu. =CBI Report and Conviction of accused= It is possible that Dubey may have been the victim of a simple robbery during which Mantu Kumar shot him, as alleged in the case filed by CBI. However, given the death and disappearance of several witnesses and the startling escape of the prime accused, there is widespread speculation that vested interests may have engaged the criminals who actually pulled the trigger. As for the GQ project, the Supreme Court is currently overlooking investigations into the corruption charges initially raised by the Dubey letter. Several officials have been indicted and a technical team is overseeing the actual construction. Also, as of September 2005, news reports indicated that the law ministry was about to introduce legislation to protect whistleblowers. Meanwhile, on 10 February 2006, a 600-meter stretch of the GQ highway connecting Kolkata to Chennai subsided into the ground, opening up ten meter gorge near Bally, West Bengal.GQ: Howrah highway stretch caves in\\". Indian Express, 10 February 2006 This stretch had been executed as a joint venture between two Malaysian firms RBM and Pati, who had been awarded the contract after global tendering. More than six years after the murder, on 22 March 2010, a Patna Court convicted three accused Mantu Kumar, Udai Kumar and Pinku Ravidas for murdering Dubey.\\"Three convicted in Satyendra Dubey murder case\\". Indian Express, 22 March 2010 The court convicted accused Mantu Kumar under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 302 (Murder) and 394 (Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), and section 27 (A) of the Arms Act for possessing an unlicensed weapon.

Etch≈´ annexed Noto Province in 741 AD, but Noto was separated out again in 757 AD. In 746 AD, the noted poet ≈åtomo no Yakamochi became Kokushi, and left many references to the region in the poetic anthology Man'y≈çsh≈´. The Nara period provincial capital and provincial temple were located in what is now the city of Takaoka, Toyama; however, there are four shrines which vie for the title of Ichinomiya two of which are located in Takaoka, one the city of Nanto and one in the town of Tateyama. Under the Engishiki classification system, Etch≈´ was ranked as a \\"superior country\\" (‰∏äÂõΩ) in terms of importance and \\"middle country\\" (‰∏≠ÂõΩ) in terms of distance from the capital. Despite this classification, Etch≈´ never developed a powerful local g≈çzoku clan and was usually controlled by its more powerful neighbours. During the Muromachi period, the Hatakeyama clan emerged as shugo of the region, but preferred to remain in Kyoto, and to rule through appointed deputies, such as the Jinb≈ç clan and the Shiina clan. Into the Sengoku period, the Hatakeyama transferred their power base to Nanao Castle in Noto province, and Etch≈´ became an area contested by the Uesugi clan and the Oda clan with the Ikk≈ç- ikki helping play one side against the other. The area was eventually conquered by Oda Nobunaga's general Shibata Katsuie and his deputy Sassa Narimasa, who were later replaced by Maeda Toshiie under the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Maeda clan retained control of the province under Kaga Domain during the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. During the mid-Edo period, Nei District and much of Niikawa District were separated from Kaga Domain into the 100,000 koku Toyama Domain, which was ruled by a branch of the Maeda clan. Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Etch≈´ Province was divided into Kanazawa Prefecture, Toyama Prefecture, Nanao Prefecture and Niikawa Prefecture, but these areas were reconsolidated into Ishikawa Prefecture in 1876.

The battle was fought after a long siege which started in 262 BC and resulted both in a Roman victory and the beginning of Roman control of Sicily. The city Agrigentum is a city on the island of Sicily, from the southern coast. It is on a plateau, surrounded by steep slopes on all sides except the west. The city was protected by the Hypsas River (Drago) to the west and the Akragas River to the east. The natural barriers meant the only way to attack the city was from the west, making the city easily defensible. The city commanded a main route along the southern coast and also routes leading northwards and eastwards to other cities. The major status of Agrigentum meant that it was a target for invading forces, and in 262 BC the Romans attacked the city to prevent the Carthaginians from holding it and using it as a staging ground for an attack on Rome. Prelude to the Siege of Agrigentum In 288 BC, the Mamertines, Italian mercenaries that were hired to attack the Carthaginians, went to the city of Messana to protect it but instead massacred its men, took the land, and forced the women to become their wives. They then used the city as a base of operations for raiding neighboring cities. Hiero II, then leader of Syracuse, campaigned against the Mamertines. At some time between 268 and 265, Hiero II decisively defeated the Mamertines at the Longanus River, which caused the Mamertines to appeal to Carthage and Rome, the other major powers in the region besides Syracuse, for military aid. A Carthaginian commander in Sicily responded and sent a small force to garrison Messana‚Äôs citadel. Hiero II did not want openly to attack the Carthaginians and invite a war, so he retreated back to Syracuse. Carthage had already been trying to control Sicily for centuries, and their main opposition had been the Greek colonies spread around the island. Syracuse, the wealthiest and most powerful of the Greek colonies in Sicily, had always been Carthage's main opposition. Taking control of Messana allowed Carthage to decrease Syracuse's power, and since Carthage already controlled North Africa, parts of Spain, Sardinia, and some small islands in the Mediterranean, control of Messana could lead to the conquest of Sicily. Additionally, Messana was an excellent staging area if the Carthaginians wanted to invade Italy and attack Rome. While the Romans had been steadily expanding their territory for over a century, their army had never fought a battle outside of the Italian Peninsula. Carthage's control of an invasion route into Italy threatened Rome's newly conquered territory in southern Italy as well as Rome itself. In 264 BC, the Roman Senate voted to send an expedition to Sicily under the command of Appius Claudius Caudex, one of the consuls for that year. Whether the Centuriate Assembly of Rome formally declared war is disputed. Adrian Goldsworthy has maintained that it was highly unlikely, and that, although the Romans knew war with Syracuse was almost a certainty, they believed their military would deter or swiftly defeat any opposition in Sicily. The Romans intended to send two legions to Sicily in 262 BC, and were probably willing to negotiate peace with Carthage. Since 264 BC, when they had declared war on Carthage, there had not been much serious fighting between the two except for a small battle in the straits of Messana. The Carthaginians also made conciliatory gestures at the start of the war, but in 262 BC, they started to increase their forces in Sicily. Once the Carthaginians started increasing their forces on the island, the Romans sent consuls there. The consuls were the generals of the Roman army, and with them came several legions. The Carthaginians hired Ligurian, Celtic, and Spanish mercenaries to encourage their enemies in Sicily to attack the Romans on the half of the island which the Romans controlled. Agrigentum at this point became the main base for the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians began sending forces to Sardinia using sea power, but most of their army was in Sicily. It seemed that they planned to use the island as a base for attacks on Italy. The Roman consuls, Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus focused their forces on Agrigentum. The consuls commanded a combined force of 40,000 men. Hannibal Gisco, the commander of Agrigentum and the son of Gisgo, gathered many of the people who lived in the area surrounding the city behind the city walls, swelling the population of the city to about 50,000; his garrison was relatively small. Hannibal refused to fight outside the city walls, which the Romans might have seen as a sign of weakness. The Romans then set up their camp about a mile from the city and harvested the crops from the area. Siege Hannibal finally attacked the Romans while they were harvesting the crops in the fields. The Romans, outnumbered and unarmed, fled the area. The picket guarding their camp was the Romans' only fortification, and although they lost many men, they were able to defeat another Carthaginian contingent that was attempting to penetrate the camp. This first skirmish made Hannibal realise that he could not afford to lose any more men. He became increasingly reluctant to attack again, and the Romans realised they had underestimated their enemy. The Roman consuls realised that they had to cut off Agrigentum from the outside world and blockade the city to cause starvation in order to force its inhabitants to surrender. The Romans began digging a system of ditches and small forts surrounding the city to prevent the inhabitants from preparing for the siege. The consuls divided their forces, with one force near the Temple of Asklepios to the south of the city and the other force stationed to the west of the city. There was a stalemate for five months until November 262 BC when supplies began to run out in Agrigentum. Hannibal became increasingly concerned over the limited resources, so he sent urgent messages to Carthage appealing for help. Carthage sent a relief force from Africa commanded by Hanno, whom historians believe to have been the son of Hannibal. There are varying accounts as to the details of Hanno‚Äôs army. Polybius, the Greek historian, stated that there were about 50 elephants, Numidian cavalry, and mercenaries. Diodoros, another historian, wrote there were 50,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 60 elephants. Yet another historian, Orosius refers to 30,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and 30 elephants. Hanno first advanced and concentrated his troops at Heraclea Minoa, about west of Agrigentum. Hanno managed to capture the Roman supply base at Herbesos, causing shortages in supplies in the Roman camp, which led to disease and privation. This seizure of the Roman supplies also cut off the Roman lines of communication. Hanno then marched on, telling his Numidian cavalry to attack the Roman cavalry and then feign retreat. The Romans pursued the Numidians as they retreated and were brought to the main Carthaginian column. The Romans suffered many losses. Hanno then took a position on Toros (Torus), a hill about a mile from the Romans camp, where further skirmishes took place for two months, causing the siege to last from six to seven months. With Hanno camped outside their own camp, the Roman supply lines from Syracuse were no longer available. With their own army at risk of starvation, the consuls chose to offer battle. This time it was Hanno's turn to refuse, probably with the intention of defeating the Romans by hunger. Meanwhile, the situation inside Agrigentum after more than six months of siege was close to desperate. Hannibal, communicating with the outside by smoke signals, sent urgent pleas for relief, and Hanno was forced to accept a pitched battle. While there are several accounts giving details of the actual fighting, they are‚Äîas is common with ancient records‚Äîinconsistent and difficult to reconcile. Battle The Greek historian Polybius says that for two months, the two enemies were stationed close together outside the city without any direct conflict. Hannibal, still in the city, was sending a constant flow of messages and fire- signals stressing the city‚Äôs food shortages and desertion of the enemy which caused Hanno to fight. The Romans, who were also close to starvation, accepted the fight. After a long struggle, the Romans killed most of the Carthaginians; the Carthaginians lost 3,000 infantry and 200 cavalry killed, as well as 4,000 prisoners and eight elephants killed and 33 disabled. Throughout the whole siege, the Romans lost 30,000 infantry and 540 cavalry or more plausibly, one- third of their 40,000‚Äì50,000 troops. The high Roman losses and the escape of the Carthaginian army meant that no triumph was awarded for either consul. Byzantine writer Zonaras wrote that Hanno deployed his army to battle but the Romans declined to fight because of the previous defeat of their cavalry. As food shortages became more severe, the consuls finally decided to fight, but Hanno was deterred by their confidence. Hanno originally wanted to co-ordinate his attack with Hannibal‚Äôs, but the Romans became aware of the plan. The Romans then ambushed the Carthaginian rear, so when Hanno attacked them, he was taken from both front and rear. The Romans also defeated an attack by the Carthaginian garrison. A more likely version of the battle is that Hanno deployed the Carthaginian infantry in two lines, with the elephants and reinforcements in the second and the cavalry probably placed in the wings. The Romans battle plan is unknown but they typically organized in their triplex acies formation. All the sources agree that the fighting was long and that it was the Romans who managed to break the Carthaginian front. This provoked panic in the rear and the reserves fled the battlefield. It is also possible that the elephants also panicked and in their flight disorganized the Carthaginian formation. The Romans routed the enemy and were victorious. Their cavalry managed to attack the Carthaginian camp and capture several elephants. But this was not a complete success. Most of the enemy army fled and Hannibal Gisco, together with the garrison of Agrigentum, also managed to break the Roman line and escape for security. No matter which of the three versions is correct, the Romans defeated the Carthaginians and forced Hanno to retreat. The night after the battle, Hannibal managed to escape Agrigentum with his mercenaries by filling the Roman trenches with straw. The next morning, the Romans pursued Hannibal and his garrison, and attacked the rear-guard, but eventually turned back to take control of Agrigentum. While seizing the city without opposition, they plundered the city and sold 25,000 inhabitants into slavery. Aftermath Following this battle (the first among four pitched land battles fought in the First Punic War), the Romans occupied Agrigentum and sold the whole population into slavery. Though acts of brutality like this were commonplace, it proved counterproductive. It hardened the attitude of many other towns which might otherwise have proven friendly to Rome. The taking of Agrigentum was a significant victory for the Romans, although they came close to disaster on multiple occasions. Because Hannibal and his garrison managed to escape relatively unharmed, there was no Roman triumph for the two consuls, and it detracted from the success of the battle. After 261 BC, Rome controlled most of Sicily and secured the grain harvest for its own use. This victory in the first large-scale campaign fought outside Italy gave the Romans extra confidence to pursue overseas interests.

Thompson; A Brief History) Thompson (December 31, 1860 ‚Äì June 21, 1940) was a United States Army officer best remembered as the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun. Early life Born on December 31, 1860, in Newport, Kentucky, Thompson grew up on a succession of Army posts and had decided on the military as a career by the age of sixteen. His father was Lt. Col. James Thompson, his mother was Maria Taliaferro. After a year at Indiana University in 1877, he gained an appointment to the United States Military Academy, graduating in 1882. His first duty station was in his birthplace of Newport, where he was assigned to the 2nd Artillery as a second lieutenant. He then attended engineering and artillery schools and was finally assigned to the Army's Ordnance Department in 1890, where he spent the rest of his military career. During this period he began his specialization in small arms. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War With the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Thompson was promoted to lieutenant colonel and sent to Tampa, Florida as Chief Ordnance Officer for the commander of the Cuban campaign, General William R. Shafter. While the rest of the Army was plagued with logistical problems, Thompson managed ordnance supply operations to Cuba efficiently. More than 18,000 tons of munitions were transferred to the battlefield from his Tampa command without any accidents. Thompson was promoted to colonel, the youngest such in the Army at the time. It was also this war that offered Thompson his first exposure to automatic weapons. At the request of Lt. John H. Parker, Thompson arranged for the informal formation of a Gatling gun unit, with fifteen weapons and a generous supply of ammunition, all shipped to Cuba on Thompson's sole authority. This unit later played a significant role in the Battle of San Juan Hill. Thompsons J.T.T inspector mark on a Colt Philippine Model of 1902 DA Revolver After the war, Thompson was appointed the chief of the Small Arms Division for the Ordnance Department. While in this position he supervised the development of the M1903 Springfield rifle and chaired the ordnance board that approved the M1911 pistol. For the latter, he devised unusual tests involving firing the weapon at donated human cadavers and live cattle to assess ammunition effectiveness. World War I World War I began in Europe in 1914, and Thompson was sympathetic to the Allied cause. Since the U.S. did not immediately enter the war, and because he recognized a significant need for small arms in Europe (as well as an opportunity to make a substantial profit), Thompson retired from the Army in November of that year and took a job as Chief Engineer of the Remington Arms Company. While with the company he supervised the construction of the Eddystone Arsenal in Chester, Pennsylvania, at that time the largest small arms plant in the world. It manufactured Pattern 1914 Enfield rifles for British forces, and Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles for Russia. General John T. Thompson holding an M1921 The introduction of trench warfare in the First World War changed tactics substantially, and by 1916 Thompson was experimenting again with automatic small arms, this time attempting to design a weapon that troops could use to clear an enemy trench‚Äîwhat he called a \\"trench broom.\\" Thompson studied several designs and was impressed with a delayed-blowback breech system designed by John Blish, a commander in the United States Navy. With Blish as a partner, Thompson obtained the necessary venture capital to form the Auto-Ordnance Company, and began working on the design of what eventually became the Thompson submachine gun.http://www.sightm1911.com/lib/history/background.htm#test The Thompson- LaGarde Cadaver Tests When the United States finally entered the war in 1917, Thompson returned to the Army and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He served as Director of Arsenals throughout the remainder of the war, in which capacity he supervised all small-arms production for the Army. For this service he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. He retired again after the war, in December 1918, and resumed work perfecting the \\"Tommy Gun.\\" Thompson originally pursued the Autorifle concept: a rifle utilizing the Blish principle delayed-blowback action to avoid the complexity of recoil- operated and gas-operated actions. Testing found that the military issue .30-06 cartridge was too powerful to work satisfactorily using the Blish system. Thompson eventually decided to use the same .45 caliber ammunition in the Thompson submachine gun that he had vetted for use in the M1911 while in the Army. The weapon was patented in 1920, but the major source for contracts had ended with the armistice. Thompson, therefore, marketed the weapon to civilian law enforcement agencies, who bought it in respectable quantities. However, by 1928 low sales had led the company to the financial crisis, and Thompson was replaced as head of the Auto-Ordnance Company.  Death  Thompson died at the age of 79 on June 21, 1940, https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/3655 John Taliaferro Thompson and is buried on the grounds of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Shortly after his death, the looming entry of the U.S. into World War II prompted the Army to order the Thompson submachine gun in large quantities, and it was used extensively during that conflict.

It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic eight-round M1 Garand starting in 1936. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle. History =Background= During the 1898 war with Spain, the M1893 Mauser used by the Spanish Army gained a deadly reputation, particularly from the Battle of San Juan Hill where 750 Spanish regulars significantly delayed the advance of 15,000 U.S. troops armed with outclassed Springfield Model 1892‚Äì99 Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen bolt-action rifles and older single-shot Springfield rifles. The Spanish soldiers inflicted 1,400 U.S. casualties in a matter of minutes. Likewise, earlier in the day, a Spanish force of 540 regulars armed with the same Mauser rifle under Spanish General Vara Del Rey held off General Henry Ware Lawton's Second Division of 6,653 American soldiers and an Independent Brigade of 1,800 men for ten hours in the nearby town of El Caney, keeping that division from assisting in the attack on the San Juan Heights. A U.S. Army board of investigation was commissioned as a direct result of both battles. They recommended replacement of the Krag. The 1903 adoption of the M1903 was preceded by nearly 30 years of struggle and politics, using lessons learned from the recently adopted Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen and contemporary German Mauser G98 bolt-action rifles. The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army's Krag, but also the Lee Model 1895 and M1885 Remington‚ÄìLee used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single-shot trap-door Springfield Model 1873s. While the Krag had been issued in both a long rifle and carbine, the Springfield was issued only as a short 24-inch barrel rifle in keeping with current trends in Switzerland and Great Britain to eliminate the need for both long rifles and carbines. The two main problems usually cited with the Krag were its slow-to-load magazine and its inability to handle higher chamber pressures for high-velocity rounds. The United States Army attempted to introduce a higher-velocity cartridge in 1899 for the existing Krags, but its single locking lug on the bolt could not withstand the extra chamber pressure. Though a stripper-clip or charger loading modification to the Krag was designed, it was clear to Army authorities that a new rifle was required. After the U.S. military's experience with the Mauser rifle in the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, authorities decided to adopt a stronger Mauser-derived design equipped with a charger- or stripper clip-loaded box magazine. =Advances in small arms technology= In 1882, the bolt action .45 Remington Lee rifle design of 1879, with its newly invented detachable box magazine, was purchased in limited numbers by the U.S. Navy. Several hundred 1882 Lee Navy Models (M1882 Remington-Lee) were also subjected to trials by the U.S. Army during the 1880s, though the rifle was not formally adopted. The Navy adopted the Model 1885, and later different style Lee Model 1895 (a 6mm straight pull bolt), which saw service in the Boxer Rebellion. In Army service, both the 1885 and 1895 6mm Lee were used in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, along with the .30 Krag and the .45-70 Model 1873 Springfield. The Lee rifle's detachable box magazine was invented by James Paris Lee, and would be very influential on later rifle designs. Other advancements had made it clear that the Army needed a replacement. In 1892, the U.S. military held a series of rifle trials, resulting in the adoption of the .30 Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifle. The Krag officially entered U.S. service in 1894, only to be replaced nine years later by the Springfield M1903. =Development= Thousands of Spanish Mauser Model 93 rifles, surrendered by Spanish troops in Cuba, were returned to the U.S. and extensively studied at Springfield Armory, where it was decided that the Mauser was the superior design. U.S. Rifle Model 1900 .30 prototype A prototype rifle was produced in 1900; it was very similar to Rifle No. 5, the final Mauser M92 prototype in the U.S. Army rifle trials of 1892. This design was rejected, and a new design combining features of the 1898 Krag rifle and the 1893 Spanish Mauser was developed. U.S. Rifle Model 1901 .30 prototype Springfield began work on creating a rifle that could handle higher loads around the turn of the 20th century. The Springfield Model 1901 prototype combined the cock-on-opening bolt, 30\\" barrel, magazine cutoff, stock and sights of the Krag-J√∏rgensen with the dual locking lugs, external claw extractor, and staggered-column magazine of the 1893 Mauser. Taking a cue from the 1898 Mauser Gewehr 98, a large safety lug was added to the side of the bolt behind the extractor, which would engage the receiver bridge and prevent the bolt moving rearwards. The bolt handle was also bent downwards, to make operation of the bolt faster. The Springfield Model 1901 almost entered production. Springfield was sure enough that the Springfield Model 1901 prototype would be accepted that they began making some parts, but it was not accepted and further changes were asked for. =Adoption= Following then- current trends in service rifles, the barrel was shortened to 24\\" after it was discovered that a longer barrel offered no appreciable ballistic advantage, and the shorter barrel was lighter and easier to handle. This \\"short rifle\\" also eliminated the need of a shorter carbine for mounted troops or cavalry. A spike-type bayonet with storage in the fore end of the stock was added to the design. This new design was accepted, type classified and officially adopted as the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, Model 1903 and entered production in 1903. The M1903 became commonly known among its users as the \\"ought-three\\" in reference to the year '03 of first production. The War Department had exhaustively studied and dissected several examples of the Spanish Mauser Model 1893 rifle captured during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and applied some features of the U.S. Krag rifle to a bolt and magazine system derived from the Mauser Model 93, to produce the new U.S. Springfield Rifle, the Model 1903. Despite Springfield Armory's use of a two-piece firing pin and other slight design alterations, the 1903 was, in fact, a Mauser design, and after that company brought suit, the U.S. government was judged to pay $250,000 in royalties to Mauser Werke. By January 1905 over 80,000 of these rifles had been produced at the federally owned Springfield Armory. However, President Theodore Roosevelt objected to the design of the sliding rod-type bayonet used as being too flimsy for combat. In a letter to the Secretary of War, he said: > I must say that I think that ramrod bayonet is about as poor an invention as > I ever saw. As you observed, it broke short off as soon as hit with even > moderate violence. It would have no moral effect and mighty little physical > effect. All the rifles to that point consequently had to be re-tooled for a blade-type bayonet, called the M1905. The sights were also an area of concern, so the new improved Model 1904 sight was also added. The retooling was almost complete when it was decided another change would be made. It was to incorporate improvements discovered during experimentation in the interim, most notably the use of pointed ammunition, first adopted by the French in the 1890s and later other countries. The round itself was based on the .30-03, but rather than a 220-grain (14 g) round-tip bullet fired at , it had a 150-grain (9.7 g) pointed bullet fired at ; the case neck was a fraction of an inch shorter as well. The new American cartridge was designated \\"Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906\\". The M1906 cartridge is better known as the .30-06 Springfield round used in many rifles and machine guns, and is still a popular civilian cartridge to the present day. The rifle's sights were again re-tooled to compensate for the speed and trajectory of the new cartridge. By the time of the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition the 1903 Springfield Rifle was the standard issue service rifle of US forces. Some rifles were fitted with both the Warner & Swasey Model 1913 and 1908 \\"Musket Sights\\" during the campaign. \\"Musket Sights\\" being the vernacular at the time for telescopic sights. Annecdotal evidence at the time indicates that some of the rifles were fitted with Maxim silencers, which would make them the first U.S. Military Suppressed Rifles. The Warner & Swasey Model 1913 Musket Sight would continue to see service after the Pancho Villa Expedition and during World War I but would be deemed inadequate and was removed from the US Army's inventory by the 1920s. =World War I and interwar use= US Marines with M1903 rifles and bayonets in France (1918) periscope stock fitted to an M1903 (1918). Designed for trench warfare, this enabled the shooter to fire over the parapet of a trench while remaining under cover and protected; the rifle is also fitted with a 25-round magazine. The Pederson device outfitted to the M1903 allows it to fire .30 calibre pistol-grade cartridges in semi-automatic fire mode. By the time of U.S. entry into World War I, 843,239 of these rifles had been produced at Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal. Pre-war production utilized questionable metallurgy. Some receivers constructed of single-heat-treated case-hardened steel were improperly subjected to excessive temperatures during the forging process. The carbon could be \\"burnt\\" out of the steel producing a brittle receiver.Canfield, February 2008, p. 13 Despite documented evidence indicating some early rifles were improperly forged, actual cases of failure were very rare. Although several cases of serious injury from receiver failure were documented, the U.S. Army never reported any fatalities. Many failures were attributed to use of incorrect cartridges, such as the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser. Evidence also seems to suggest that improperly forged brass cartridge cases could have exacerbated receiver failure.Lyon, Joseph: Some Observations On The Failure Of U.S. Model 1903 Rifle Receivers Pyrometers were installed in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change was made at approximately serial number 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at serial number 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower serial numbers are known as \\"low-number\\" M1903 rifles. Higher serial numbers are said to be \\"double-heat-treated.\\" Toward the end of the war, Springfield turned out the Model 1903 Mark I. The Mark I has a cut on the left hand side of the receiver meant to act as an ejection port for the Pedersen Device, a modified sear and cutoff to operate the Pedersen Device; a specialized insert that replaced the bolt and allowed the user to fire .30 caliber pistol cartridges semi-automatically from a 40-round detachable magazine. The stock was also slightly cut down on the left side to clear the ejection port. In all other respects, the Mark I is identical to the 1903. Temperature control during forging was improved prior to Mark I production. The receiver alloy was toughened by addition of nickel after Mark I production. In 1926, after experiencing the effect of long-range German 7.92√ó57mm Mauser and machine gun fire during the war, the U.S. Army adopted the heavy 174-grain boat-tail bullet for its .30-06 cartridge, standardized as 'Cartridge, Ball, caliber 30, M1'.Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, 6th ed., DBI Books Inc. (1989), p. 59 M1 ammunition, intended primarily for long-range machine gun use, soon became known by Army rifle competition teams and expert riflemen for its considerably greater accuracy over that of the M1906-round; the new M1 ammunition was issued to infantrymen with the Springfield rifle as well as to machine gun teams. However, during the late 1930s, it became apparent that, with the development of mortars, high-angle artillery, and the .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun, the need for extreme long-range, rifle-caliber machine- gun fire was decreasing. In 1938, the U.S. army reverted to a .30-06 cartridge with a 152-grain flat-base bullet, now termed M2 Ball, for all rifles and machine guns. In the 1920s and the 1930s, M1903s were delivered to US allies in Central America, such as Cuba, Costa Rica or Nicaragua. Costa Rica troops were equipped with Springfields during the Coto War and some rifles were captured by the opposing Panamanians. The Cuban Springfields will be used by Batista forces after WW2 and later by the Revolutionary Armed Forces, for instance during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The Federal Bureau of Investigation acquired some M1903 rifles configured like National Rifle Association Sporter Models in response to the 1933 Kansas City Massacre.Vanderpool, Bill \\"Bring Enough Gun\\" American Rifleman October 2013 pp. 80‚Äì85&115‚Äì116 In service, the Springfield was generally prized for its reliability and accuracy, though some problems remained. The precision rear aperture sight was located too far from the eye for efficient use, and the narrow, unprotected front sight was both difficult to see in poor light and easily damaged. The U.S. Marine Corps issued the Springfield with a sight hood to protect the front sight, along with a thicker front blade. The two-piece firing pin/striker also proved to be no improvement over the original one-piece Mauser design, and was a cause of numerous Ordnance repairs, along with occasional reports of jammed magazine followers. Camouflaged M1903 Springfield sniper's rifle with Warner & Swasey telescopic sight, in France, May 1918. =World War II= World War II saw new production of the Springfield at private manufacturers such as the Remington Arms and Smith-Corona Typewriter companies. Remington began production of the M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the Rock Island Arsenal which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an \\"R\\". M1903 production was discontinued in favor of the M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 302 Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part. All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal. In late 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company also began production of the M1903A3 at its plant in Syracuse, NY.Brophy, William, The Springfield 1903 Rifles, Stackpole Books (1985), p. 187 Smith/Corona parts are mostly identified by the absence of markings, except for occasions when time permitting during manufacture, on early to mid production rifles, and also only on certain parts. To speed up production output, two-groove rifled barrels were adopted, and steel alloy specifications were relaxed under 'War Emergency Steel' criteria for both rifle actions and barrels.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 362 M1903A3 rifles with two- groove 'war emergency' barrels were shipped with a printed notation stating that the reduction in rifling grooves did not affect accuracy.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 301 As the war progressed, various machining and finishing operations were eliminated on the M1903A3 in order to increase production levels. Original production rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray/black finish similar to the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray/green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons. It is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Much, if not all, World War II .30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper barrel cleaning these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. In the jungle fighting on various Pacific islands cleaning was sometimes lax and the excessive moisture compounded the corrosive action of the residue. The M1903 and the M1903A3 rifle were used in combat alongside the M1 Garand by the U.S. military during World War II and saw extensive use and action in the hands of U.S. troops in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific. The U.S. Marines were initially armed with M1903 rifles in early battles in the Pacific, such as the Battle of Guadalcanal, but the jungle battle environment generally favored self-loading rifles;George, John (Lt Col), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 391: \\"Nearly every one [Marine] I talked to [on Guadalcanal] who used the Springfield in combat-without a scope-would have much rather been using a Garand.\\" later Army units arriving to the island were armed with the M1 Garand.George, John (Lt Col), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 391 The U.S. Army Rangers were also a major user of the M1903 and the M1903A3 during World War II with the Springfield being preferred over the M1 Garand for certain commando missions. According to Bruce Canfield's encyclopedic U.S. Infantry Weapons of WW II, final variants of the M1903 (the A3 and A4) were delivered in February 1944. By then, most American combat troops had been re-equipped with the M1 Garand. However, some front-line infantry units in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps retained M1903s as infantry rifles beyond that date and continued to use them alongside the M1 Garand until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The Springfield remained in service for snipers (using the M1903A4), grenadiers (using a spigot type rifle 22 mm with the M1 grenade launcher] grenade launcher until the M7 grenade launcher was available for the M1 rifle in late 1943), and Marine Scout Sniper units.  Sniper rifle The M1903A4 was the U.S. Army's sniper rifle of choice during the Second World War. The M1903A4 was a variation of the M1903A3. The only difference between receivers was that the model and serial number on the receiver were split on 1903A4 to make room for the Redfield scope mount. The Redfield scope mount removed the rear peep sight that was standard on the M1903A3. The scope used on the M1903A4 was a Weaver Model 330 or 330C, which was a 2.75x telescopic sight. The receivers were tested by Remington Arms and those that were deemed best, meaning those closest to design specifications were selected to become M1903A4's. The barrels were also selected specifically to be added to the M1903A4 rifle only if they were within almost exact specifications for the design. The front sight on the barrel was never installed on the A4 barrels, however, the notch for it was still in place. . Barrel specifications were, in general, unchanged between the M1903A3 and M1903A4, however, the War Department did start installing barrels with 2 groove rifling instead of 4 groove, despite the lack of clear changes from the 4 groove rifling that was the standard up until 1942.George, John (Lt. Col.), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 392 By some accounts, the M1903A4 was inadequate as a sniper rifle. The M1903A4 was a relatively accurate rifle with an effective range of about 600 yards (550m). These limitations on long-range targeting were due to the limited field of view present in both the Weaver scopes. From its adoption in 1943 until the end of the war it was used extensively in every theater of operation by both the US Army and the USMC.George, John (Lt. Col.), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 392‚Äì393 The Weaver scopes (later standardized as the M73 and M73B1) were not only low-powered in magnification, they were not waterproofed, and frequently fogged over or became waterlogged during humidity changes. In addition, the M81/82 optional scopes also had significant flaws. They most notably had less power (2.2x vs. 2.75x) and, like the other scopes on the M1903A4, had serious issues with the field of view.George, John (Lt. Col.), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 296‚Äì299 The USMC would eventually switch to a large 8x scope that spanned the length of the rifle designed by John Unertl.  Foreign users The U.S. Army Military Police (MP) and the U.S. Navy Shore Patrol also used M1903s and M1903A3s throughout the war. Various U.S. allies and friendly irregular forces were also equipped with the weapon. The Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB), operating in the 5th Army in Italy was equipped with Springfield M1903 rifles. In August 1943, the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle were re-equipped by the United States primarily with M1903A3 Springfield and M1917 Enfield Rifles. The M1903A3 became one of the primary rifles used by French forces until the end of the war, and was afterwards used in Indochina and by local militia and security forces in French Algeria. Large numbers of M1903 Springfields were sent to China. During the Korean War, South Korean Marines used M1903A3 South Korean marine armed with M1903 rifle, September 20, 1950. Springfield M1903 rifles captured by the Germans were designated Gewehr 249(a). =Post Korean War service= After the Korean War, active service (as opposed to drill) use of the M1903 was rare. Still, some M1903A4s remained in sniper use as late as the Vietnam War; and technical manuals for them were printed as late as 1970. The U.S. Navy also continued to carry some stocks of M1903A3s on board ships, for use as anti-mine rifles. =Today= M1903 Springfield with 8x Unertl scope used during a vintage sniper rifle match in 2012 Due to its balance, it is still popular with various military drill teams and color guards, most notably the U.S. Army Drill Team. M1903 rifles (along with the M1 Garand, M1917 Enfield and M14 rifles) are also common at high school Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) units to teach weapons handling and military drill procedures to the cadets. JROTC units use M1903s for regular and inter- school competition drills, including elaborate exhibition spinning routines. Exhibition teams often use fiberglass stocks in place of wooden stocks, which are heavier and more prone to breakage when dropped. JROTC Color Guards still favor wooden stocks over fiberglass because of their weight characteristics and appearance. The M1903 is also the standard parade rifle of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, which has over six hundred M1903s, a very small percentage of which are still fireable. The Summerall Guards of The Citadel South Carolina Corps of Cadets in Charleston, S.C. also use the Springfield 1903 model for their silent drill performances, which include annual trips to Mardi Gras, as well as many other notable performances. Contemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals. U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps color guard rifles bear many similarities to the Springfield. In 1977, the Army located a rather large cache of unissued M1903A3 rifles which were demilitarized and then issued to JROTC units as a replacement for their previously issued M1 Garand and M14 rifles, which were then returned to Army custody due to concerns about potential break-ins at high school JROTC armories. For safety reasons, the JROTC M1903s are made permanently unable to fire by plugging the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the ON position. To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod was inserted; after it warmed up it was too tight to remove. Specifications Diagram of the .30 Springfield Rifle The U.S. rifle, Model of 1903 was 44‚Öû inches (1.098 m) long and weighed 8 lb 11 oz (3.95 kg). A bayonet could be attached; the M1905 bayonet blade was 16 in (406 mm) long and weighed 1 lb (0.45 kg). From 1906, the rifle was chambered to fire the .30-caliber M1906 cartridge (.30-06 cartridge), later the M1 (1926) and M2 Ball (1938) rounds. There were four standard types of cartridge: * Ball: consisted of a brass case or shell, primer, a charge of smokeless powder, and the bullet. The bullet had a sharp point called a spitzer bullet, and was composed of a lead core and a jacket of cupro-nickel (later gilding metal), and in the M1906 design, weighed 150 grains (9.7 g). The bullet of the M1906 cartridge, when fired from the rifle, had an initial velocity of . * Blank: contained a paper cup instead of a bullet. It is dangerous up to . * Guard: had a smaller charge of powder than the ball cartridge, and five cannelures encircle the body of the shell at about the middle to distinguish it from ball cartridges. It was intended for use on guard or in riot duty, and it gave good results up to . The range of required a sight elevation of , and the range of required an elevation of . * Dummy: this was tin-plated and the shell was provided with six longitudinal corrugations and three circular holes. The primer contains no percussion composition. It was intended for drill purposes to accustom the soldier to the operation of loading the rifle. The rifle was sighted for and had a point- blank range of . The maximum range of the ball cartridge, when elevated at an angle of 45¬∞, was . The rifle was a magazine-fed clip-loader and could fire at a rate of 20 shots per minute. Each stripper clip contained five cartridges, and standard issue consisted of 12 clips carried in a cloth bandoleer. When full the bandoleer weighed about . Bandoleers were packed 20 in a box, for a total of 1,200 rounds. The full box weighed . The bore of the rifle is 0.30 inches (7.62 mm) in diameter. It was then rifled 0.004 in (0.1 mm) deep, making the diameter from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove 0.30787 in (7.82 mm) of the barrel. The 1903 rifle included a rear sight leaf that could be used to adjust for elevation. When the leaf was flat, the battle sight appeared on top. This sight was set for , and was not adjustable. When the leaf was raised it could be adjusted to a maximum extreme range of . The rear sight could also be adjusted for windage. The 1903A3 rear sight was an aperture sight adjustable both for elevation and windage. A feature inherent to the M1903 and not found on the Mauser 98 is the cocking piece, a conspicuous knob at the rear of the bolt, allowing the rifle's striker to be released without dry firing, or to cock the rifle if necessary, for example to attempt a second strike on a round that failed to fire. Variants There were four main variants given official nomenclature, though there are a number of important sub-variants: M1903 M1903A3 stock M1903A4 with Type C stock and M84 sight *M1903 (1903): developed for the .30-03 (also known as the .30-45) cartridge. Used original Type S stock. **M1903 Bullpup (1903): experimental bullpup conversion for the USMC. **M1903 (1905): changed from a rod type bayonet to the knife type Model 1905 bayonet and to the improved Model 1905 sight. **M1903 (1906): modified again to specifically fire the new M1906 .30-06 cartridge (\\"Ball Cartridge, caliber 30, Model of 1906\\"). **M1903 NRA (1915‚Äì1917): sold to National Rifle Association members and stamped NRA on the forward tang of the trigger guard.Canfield, Bruce N. American Rifleman (September 2008) pp. 72‚Äì75 **M1903 Air Service (1918): issued to aircrew with permanent 25-round magazine and modified Type S stock forend designed as backup for if a plane's machine gun jammed in combat. **M1903 Mark I (1918‚Äì1920): modified for specific use with the Pedersen device. **M1903 NM (1921‚Äì1940): selected rifles produced at Springfield Armory for National Match shooting competition. Production barrels were measured with star-gauges, and those meeting specified tolerances were stamped with an asterisk shaped star on the muzzle crown. These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed to prevent it from striking the nose of a right-handed shooter, and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National Match stock with a high comb and pistol grip. Total production was 28,907. Most were issued to service teams and 25,377 were reconditioned at Springfield armory after one year of match use. Reconditioned rifles have a large gas-escape port drilled into the left side of the receiver. **M1903 Bushmaster carbine (1940s): the barrel and stock were cut down to for easier use in Panama; 4,725 such rifles were made. It was a training rifle and saw no action. After World War II most were dumped into the ocean and surviving pieces are rare. **M1903 with 'scant' stock (1942): in late 1941, before the 1903A3 was standardized, Army Ordnance wanted to standardize on a pistol-grip stock for all M1903 rifles. There were thousands of stock blanks that had been sized for the old straight stock. They weren't deep enough for the full pistol grip of the Type C stock, so they were modified to allow a \\"scant\\" grip that was the largest grip they could form. These \\"scant\\" stocks would only fit on a 1903, and would not fit an 03A3. Springfield only rebuilt existing M1903 rifles using this stock in 1942 and marked the cut-off seat with a small \\"s\\". Springfield 1903A1 rifle *M1903A1 (1929‚Äì1939): changed from a straight stock to a pistol grip type stock (Type C stock). The pistol grip stock was conducive to improved marksmanship and was fitted to National Match rifles until World War II. Pistol grip stocks became standard for later M1903 production and were subsequently fitted to older rifles. The Army considered any rifle with a pistol grip stock an M1903A1, but M1903 receiver markings were unchanged. *M1903A2 (1930s‚Äì1940s): basically a stripped A1 or A3 used as a subcaliber rifle with artillery pieces. *M1903A3 (1942‚Äì1944): sights were changed to an aperture (peep) system mounted on the receiver, and the rifle was modified for easier production with stamped metal parts and somewhat different grip and stock (late model Type S stock; no finger grooves). **M1903 (Modified) (1941‚Äì1942): Transition production of M1903 rifles by Remington Arms until the M1903A3 design was implemented involved modification of various parts creating a hybrid between the M1903 and M1903A3. *M1903A4 (1942): an M1903A3 modified to be a sniper rifle using an M73 or M73B1 2.5√ó Weaver telescopic sight and different stock, and omitting the iron sights. USMC versions instead used the 8x Unertl scope. There are two main other types, various training types, and competition versions such as the National Match types. Aside from these there are some other civilian versions, experimental versions, and other miscellaneous types. Due to the duration of its service, there is also a range of smaller differences among ones from different periods and manufacturers. In military use it was outnumbered by the M1917 Enfield for much of the war. Also, during World War II many remained in use early on, especially in the Pacific (generally replaced as M1s became available), in addition to service (along with other weapons) as a sniper rifle and to launch rifle grenades. *Bannerman Springfields: At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Scottish-born military surplus magnate, Francis Bannerman VI (1851‚Äì1918), assembled 1,000 M1903 rifles from surplus parts which were rebored to accept British .303 ammunition. These he presented to the British Army together with the associated bayonets, pouches and webbing, as a patriotic gesture. Unfortunately, the conversion was not a success and it was found that the rimmed .303 cartridge would not feed properly from the magazine.Ian D. Skennerton, The Lee Enfield: A Century of Lee-Metford & Lee- Enfield Rifles & Carbines, Arms & Militaria Press 2007, (p. 162) The rifles were stamped \\"DP\\", i.e. fit for \\"drill purposes\\" only, and presented to the City of London Volunteer Training Corps who were otherwise without any weapons. In popular culture Ernest Hemingway used this rifle, with iron sights, to shoot big game, including lions, on his first African safari in 1933. That safari is the subject of Green Hills of Africa, published in 1935. This rifle was used by Private Daniel Jackson in the film Saving Private Ryan.

They roll three dice, construct an equation from the numbers to produce a new number, then cover that number on the board, trying to get four in a row. Number bingo improves math skills LPB Laos Numeracy is the ability to reason and to apply simple numerical concepts. Basic numeracy skills consist of comprehending fundamental arithmetical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, if one can understand simple mathematical equations such as 2 + 2 = 4, then one would be considered to possess at least basic numeric knowledge. Substantial aspects of numeracy also include number sense, operation sense, computation, measurement, geometry, probability and statistics. A numerically literate person can manage and respond to the mathematical demands of life. By contrast, innumeracy (the lack of numeracy) can have a negative impact. Numeracy has an influence on career decisions, and risk perception towards health decisions. For example, innumeracy distorts risk perception towards health decisions and may negatively affect economic choices. \\"Greater numeracy has been associated with reduced susceptibility to framing effects, less influence of nonnumerical information such as mood states, and greater sensitivity to different levels of numerical risk\\". Representation of numbers Humans have evolved to mentally represent numbers in two major ways from observation (not formal math). These representations are often thought to be innate (see Numerical cognition), to be shared across human cultures, to be common to multiple species, and not to be the result of individual learning or cultural transmission. They are: # Approximate representation of numerical magnitude, and # Precise representation of the quantity of individual items. Approximate representations of numerical magnitude imply that one can relatively estimate and comprehend an amount if the number is large (see Approximate number system). For example, one experiment showed children and adults arrays of many dots. After briefly observing them, both groups could accurately estimate the approximate number of dots. However, distinguishing differences between large numbers of dots proved to be more challenging. Precise representations of distinct individuals demonstrate that people are more accurate in estimating amounts and distinguishing differences when the numbers are relatively small (see Subitizing). For example, in one experiment, an experimenter presented an infant with two piles of crackers, one with two crackers the other with three. The experimenter then covered each pile with a cup. When allowed to choose a cup, the infant always chose the cup with more crackers because the infant could distinguish the difference. Both systems‚Äîapproximate representation of magnitude and precise representation quantity of individual items‚Äîhave limited power. For example, neither allows representations of fractions or negative numbers. More complex representations require education. However, achievement in school mathematics correlates with an individual's unlearned approximate number sense. Definitions and assessment Fundamental (or rudimentary) numeracy skills include understanding of the real number line, time, measurement, and estimation. Fundamental skills include basic skills (the ability to identify and understand numbers) and computational skills (the ability to perform simple arithmetical operations and compare numerical magnitudes). More sophisticated numeracy skills include understanding of ratio concepts (notably fractions, proportions, percentages, and probabilities), and knowing when and how to perform multistep operations. Two categories of skills are included at the higher levels: the analytical skills (the ability to understand numerical information, such as required to interpret graphs and charts) and the statistical skills (the ability to apply higher probabilistic and statistical computation, such as conditional probabilities). A variety of tests have been developed for assessing numeracy and health numeracy. Childhood influences The first couple of years of childhood are considered to be a vital part of life for the development of numeracy and literacy. There are many components that play key roles in the development of numeracy at a young age, such as Socioeconomic Status (SES), parenting, Home Learning Environment (HLE), and age. Socioeconomic status Children who are brought up in families with high SES tend to be more engaged in developmentally enhancing activities. These children are more likely to develop the necessary abilities to learn and to become more motivated to learn. More specifically, a mother's education level is considered to have an effect on the child's ability to achieve in numeracy. That is, mothers with a high level of education will tend to have children who succeed more in numeracy. A number of studies have, moreover, proved that the education level of the mother is strongly correlated with the average age of getting married. More precisely, females who entered the marriage later, tend to have greater autonomy, chances for skills premium and level of education (i.e. numeracy). Hence, they were more likely to share this experience with children. Parenting Parents are recommended to collaborate with their child in simple learning exercises, such as reading a book, painting, drawing, and playing with numbers. On a more expressive note, the act of using complex language, being more responsive towards the child, and establishing warm interactions are recommended to parents with the confirmation of positive numeracy outcomes. When discussing beneficial parenting behaviors, a feedback loop is formed because pleased parents are more willing to interact with their child, which in essence promotes better development in the child. Home-learning environment Along with parenting and SES, a strong home-learning environment increases the likelihood of the child being prepared for comprehending complex mathematical schooling. For example, if a child is influenced by many learning activities in the household, such as puzzles, coloring books, mazes, or books with picture riddles, then they will be more prepared to face school activities. Age Age is accounted for when discussing the development of numeracy in children. Children under the age of 5 have the best opportunity to absorb basic numeracy skills. After the age of seven, achievement of basic numeracy skills become less influential. For example, a study was conducted to compare the reading and mathematical abilities between children of ages five and seven, each in three different mental capacity groups (underachieving, average, and overachieving). The differences in the amount of knowledge retained were greater between the three different groups aged five than between the groups aged seven. This reveals that those of younger ages have an opportunity to retain more information, like numeracy. Literacy There seems to be a relationship between literacy and numeracy, which can be seen in young children. Depending on the level of literacy or numeracy at a young age, one can predict the growth of literacy and/ or numeracy skills in future development. There is some evidence that humans may have an inborn sense of number. In one study for example, five-month-old infants were shown two dolls, which were then hidden with a screen. The babies saw the experimenter pull one doll from behind the screen. Without the child's knowledge, a second experimenter could remove, or add dolls, unseen behind the screen. When the screen was removed, the infants showed more surprise at an unexpected number (for example, if there were still two dolls). Some researchers have concluded that the babies were able to count, although others doubt this and claim the infants noticed surface area rather than number.Numbers in Mind Employment Numeracy has a huge impact on employment. In a work environment, numeracy can be a controlling factor affecting career achievements and failures. Many professions require individuals to have well-developed numerical skills: for example, mathematician, physicist, accountant, actuary, Risk Analyst, financial analyst, engineer, and architect. This is why a major target of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 is to substantially increase the number of youths who have relevant skills for decent work and employment because, even outside these specialized areas, the lack of numeracy skills can reduce employment opportunities and promotions, resulting in unskilled manual careers, low-paying jobs, and even unemployment. For example, carpenters and interior designers need to be able to measure, use fractions, and handle budgets. Another example of numeracy influencing employment was demonstrated at the Poynter Institute. The Poynter Institute has recently included numeracy as one of the skills required by competent journalists. Max Frankel, former executive editor of The New York Times, argues that \\"deploying numbers skillfully is as important to communication as deploying verbs\\". Unfortunately, it is evident that journalists often show poor numeracy skills. In a study by the Society of Professional Journalists, 58% of job applicants interviewed by broadcast news directors lacked an adequate understanding of statistical materials.Scanlan, Chip (2004). \\"Why Math Matters \\" Poynter Online, September 8, 2004. To assess job applicants, psychometric numerical reasoning tests have been created by occupational psychologists, who are involved in the study of numeracy. These tests are used to assess ability to comprehend and apply numbers. They are sometimes administered with a time limit, so that the test-taker must think quickly and concisely. Research has shown that these tests are very useful in evaluating potential applicants because they do not allow the applicants to prepare for the test, unlike interview questions. This suggests that an applicant's results are reliable and accurate These tests first became prevalent during the 1980s, following the pioneering work of psychologists, such as P. Kline, who published a book in 1986 entitled A handbook of test construction: Introduction to psychometric design, which explained that psychometric testing could provide reliable and objective results, which could be used to assess a candidate's numerical abilities. Innumeracy and dyscalculia The term innumeracy is a neologism, coined by analogy with illiteracy. Innumeracy refers to a lack of ability to reason with numbers. The term was coined by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter; however, it was popularized in 1989 by mathematician John Allen Paulos in his book Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences. Developmental dyscalculia refers to a persistent and specific impairment of basic numerical-arithmetical skills learning in the context of normal intelligence. Patterns and differences The root causes of innumeracy vary. Innumeracy has been seen in those suffering from poor education and childhood deprivation of numeracy. Innumeracy is apparent in children during the transition between numerical skills obtained before schooling and the new skills taught in the education departments because of their memory capacity to comprehend the material. Patterns of innumeracy have also been observed depending on age, gender, and race. Older adults have been associated with lower numeracy skills than younger adults. Men have been identified to have higher numeracy skills than women. Some studies seem to indicate young people of African heritage tend to have lower numeracy skills. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) in which children at fourth-grade (average 10 to 11 years) and eighth-grade (average 14 to 15 years) from 49 countries were tested on mathematical comprehension. The assessment included tests for number, algebra (also called patterns and relationships at fourth grade), measurement, geometry, and data. The latest study, in 2003, found that children from Singapore at both grade levels had the highest performance. Countries like Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Taiwan also shared high levels of numeracy. The lowest scores were found in countries like South Africa, Ghana, and Saudi Arabia. Another finding showed a noticeable difference between boys and girls, with some exceptions. For example, girls performed significantly better in Singapore, and boys performed significantly better in the United States. Theory There is a theory that innumeracy is more common than illiteracy when dividing cognitive abilities into two separate categories. David C. Geary, a notable cognitive developmental and evolutionary psychologist from the University of Missouri, created the terms \\"biological primary abilities\\" and \\"biological secondary abilities\\". Biological primary abilities evolve over time and are necessary for survival. Such abilities include speaking a common language or knowledge of simple mathematics. Biological secondary abilities are attained through personal experiences and cultural customs, such as reading or high level mathematics learned through schooling. Literacy and numeracy are similar in the sense that they are both important skills used in life. However, they differ in the sorts of mental demands each makes. Literacy consists of acquiring vocabulary and grammatical sophistication, which seem to be more closely related to memorization, whereas numeracy involves manipulating concepts, such as in calculus or geometry, and builds from basic numeracy skills. This could be a potential explanation of the challenge of being numerate. Innumeracy and risk perception in health decision-making Health numeracy has been defined as \\"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to access, process, interpret, communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical, biostatistical, and probabilistic health information needed to make effective health decisions\\". The concept of health numeracy is a component of the concept of health literacy. Health numeracy and health literacy can be thought of as the combination of skills needed for understanding risk and making good choices in health-related behavior. Health numeracy requires basic numeracy but also more advanced analytical and statistical skills. For instance, health numeracy also requires the ability to understand probabilities or relative frequencies in various numerical and graphical formats, and to engage in Bayesian inference, while avoiding errors sometimes associated with Bayesian reasoning (see Base rate fallacy, Conservatism (Bayesian)). Health numeracy also requires understanding terms with definitions that are specific to the medical context. For instance, although 'survival' and 'mortality' are complementary in common usage, these terms are not complementary in medicine (see five-year survival rate). Innumeracy is also a very common problem when dealing with risk perception in health-related behavior; it is associated with patients, physicians, journalists and policymakers. Those who lack or have limited health numeracy skills run the risk of making poor health-related decisions because of an inaccurate perception of information. For example, if a patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer, being innumerate may hinder her ability to comprehend her physician's recommendations, or even the severity of the health concern. One study found that people tended to overestimate their chances of survival or even to choose lower-quality hospitals. Innumeracy also makes it difficult or impossible for some patients to read medical graphs correctly. Some authors have distinguished graph literacy from numeracy. Indeed, many doctors exhibit innumeracy when attempting to explain a graph or statistics to a patient. A misunderstanding between a doctor and patient, due to either the doctor, patient, or both being unable to comprehend numbers effectively, could result in serious harm to health. Different presentation formats of numerical information, for instance natural frequency icon arrays, have been evaluated to assist both low-numeracy and high-numeracy individuals. Evolution of numeracy In the field of economic history, numeracy is often used to assess human capital at times when there was no data on schooling or other educational measures. Using a method called age-heaping, researchers like Professor J√∂rg Baten study the development and inequalities of numeracy over time and throughout regions. For example, Baten and Hippe find a numeracy gap between regions in western and central Europe and the rest of Europe for the period 1790‚Äì1880. At the same time, their data analysis reveals that these differences as well as within country inequality decreased over time. Taking a similar approach, Baten and Fourie find overall high levels of numeracy for people in the Cape Colony (late 17th to early 19th century). In contrast to these studies comparing numeracy over countries or regions, it is also possible to analyze numeracy within countries. For example, Baten, Crayen and Voth look at the effects of war on numeracy in England, and Baten and Priwitzer find a \\"military bias\\" in what is today western Hungary: people opting for a military career had - on average - better numeracy indicators (1 BCE to 3CE).

Real computation theory investigates properties of such devices under the idealizing assumption of infinite precision. In computability theory, the theory of real computation deals with hypothetical computing machines using infinite-precision real numbers. They are given this name because they operate on the set of real numbers. Within this theory, it is possible to prove interesting statements such as \\"The complement of the Mandelbrot set is only partially decidable.\\" These hypothetical computing machines can be viewed as idealised analog computers which operate on real numbers, whereas digital computers are limited to computable numbers. They may be further subdivided into differential and algebraic models (digital computers, in this context, should be thought of as topological, at least insofar as their operation on computable reals is concerned). Depending on the model chosen, this may enable real computers to solve problems that are inextricable on digital computers (For example, Hava Siegelmann's neural nets can have noncomputable real weights, making them able to compute nonrecursive languages.) or vice versa. (Claude Shannon's idealized analog computer can only solve algebraic differential equations, while a digital computer can solve some transcendental equations as well. However this comparison is not entirely fair since in Claude Shannon's idealized analog computer computations are immediately done; i.e. computation is done in real time. Shannon's model can be adapted to cope with this problem.) A canonical model of computation over the reals is Blum‚ÄìShub‚ÄìSmale machine (BSS). If real computation were physically realizable, one could use it to solve NP-complete problems, and even #P-complete problems, in polynomial time.

Geology The Forest of Fontainebleau in the western end of which Milly-la-For√™t lies, is composed of the Oligocene Fontainebleau sands, which are a marine deposit, laid down in an intertidal zone. History Milly-la-For√™t is the probable birthplace of Wulfram of Sens, Saint Wulfram; in about 640. Origin of the place name The first name of this domaine was called Maurillac in Gaul, Mauriliaco on a Merovingien coin, became Maureliacum, Melliacum in 667, Milliacum in Latin. The place name Milly is relatively current; it refers to an antic presence of a villa rustica owned during the Gallo-Romaine era by a certain Milius or Emilius. Hereby, the name was imported in 1080 by the knight Adam de Milly, originally from Milly-en- Beauvaisis and first lord of the place. But a charter dated from 651 mentioned already the name Melliacus. In the 13th century more accuracy was added to the place, Miliacum in Gastineto in 1267, which gave the name Milly-en-G√¢tinais without being official. Upon a request from the municipal council and by a statutory order from 6 February 1948, the name was replaced by Milly-la-For√™t, considered at that time as the most touristic place and to differentiate it from its homonym Milly in Normandy. The village The market hall Milly contains several facilities: such as the Coll√®ge Jean Rostand, the Conservatoire des Deux Vall√©es, a gymnasium and sports ground complex, a multimedia library, a swimming pool, a bus station, dealers in craft products and so on. There is a market every Thursday in the very impressive late medieval market hall, built in 1479. The yearly calendar includes attic- clearing sales; at the opening of the summer holiday period, the town celebrates la Saint-Pierre, a fair is organised and there are several fairground rides and other attractions, as well as cultural stands for the sale of specialist food and craft products. Economy * Milly produces many culinary and medicinal herbs. The firm of Daregal is a world leader and began in 1887 under the leadership of the Darbonne family who still run the enterprise. * The Conservatoire National des Plantes √† Parfum, M√©dicinales, Aromatiques et Industrielles is a botanical garden situated in a former farm. Culture Chapelle Saint-Blaise-des-Simples * Christian Dior and Jean Cocteau have made their homes here. Cocteau died in 1963. Towards the end of the 1950s Jean Cocteau decorated the chapelle Saint-Blaise, which dates from the twelfth century. His theme was those medicinal and culinary herbs on which the renown of Milly rests. He is now buried in the chapel. Twin towns Milly-la-For√™t is twinned with the German town of Morsbach, situated in the valley of the Sieg to the east of Cologne and with Forest Row in East Sussex, England. Famous people Many popular characters are born, died or lived in Milly-la-For√™t: *Dagobert I (v.602‚Äì638 or 639), King of the Francs was sacred at Milly. *Wulfram of Sens (647‚Äì703), archbishop of Sens and Saint was born there. *Louis IX (1214‚Äì1270), King of France lived there *Hugues II de Bouville (1240‚Äì1304), chamberlain of Philip the Fair and lord of Bouville. *Hugues III de Bouville (1275‚Äì1331), his son, chamberlain of Philip the Fair who owned the castle. *Olivier V de Clisson (1336‚Äì1407), owner of the castle of Milly. *Charles VI (1368‚Äì1422), King of France lived there. *Louis XI (1423‚Äì1483), King of France lived there. *Henri IV (1553‚Äì1610), King of France lived there. *Jacques Nicolas Bellav√®ne (1770‚Äì1826), General of division he did there. *Napol√©on Bonaparte (1769‚Äì1821), Emperor of French lived there. *Jean Cocteau (1889‚Äì1963), poet and graphist he lived and died there. *Christian Dior (1905‚Äì1957), dressmaker, he lived there. *Jean Marais (1913‚Äì1998), actor, he lived there. *Jean Tinguely (1925‚Äì1991), artist, worked there. *Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl√©zio (1940‚Äì ), writer and awarded from the Nobel Prize in Literature, lived there.

A left-handed middle-order batsman and slip fielder, he appeared in exactly 100 Test matches. Early life Thorpe was born the third and final son out of three boys in Farnham, Surrey, in August 1969. Naturally right-handed, when he was six years old Thorpe changed his stance to make it harder for his two elder brothers to get him out and because the boundary in his garden was shorter on the leg-side for a left-hander. International career Thorpe made his debut for Surrey in 1988, and his international debut in 1993. He scored a century (114 not out) in the second innings of his debut Test match, against Australia at Trent Bridge. Developing into a very highly regarded player, he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1998. Thorpe hit only one four in his hundred against Pakistan at Lahore in November 2000. It also contained seven threes, 12 twos and 51 singles. He hit another boundary before being dismissed for 118 from 301 balls. This is among the fewest ever boundaries in a Test century. However, Thorpe was also a highly capable stroke-maker: during his highest Test score, 200 not out off 231 balls against New Zealand at Christchurch in 2002, he and Andrew Flintoff compiled a partnership of 281 in 51 overs. During the 2002 season, Thorpe had marital difficulties which were well publicised in several tabloid newspapers, and this seriously affected his play and his focus on the game. Seemingly disillusioned with constant touring away from his family, he announced his retirement from the one-day game and changed his mind several times on whether to tour Australia, eventually pulling out of the tour entirely. However, in 2003 Thorpe, with family problems put to one side, returned to the England team in the fifth Test against South Africa at his home ground of The Oval, where he was warmly welcomed as a local hero with a standing ovation. Thorpe scored an excellent 124 as England won the match to force an unlikely series draw, and remained in the side for series victories against Bangladesh away and at home, against the West Indies away and at home, against New Zealand at home, and in South Africa. He played his hundredth and final Test against Bangladesh in June 2005; in the two years between his comeback and his retirement he scored 1635 Test runs at an average of 56.37. He witnessed both of Brian Lara's marathon innings of 375 in 1994 and 400* in 2004. Thorpe announced his retirement from Test cricket after the England selectors chose Kevin Pietersen instead of him for the first Test of The Ashes in July 2005. Thorpe averaged over 49.00 against Australia, but given the impending back complaint and 2005/2006 winter tour unavailability the selectors felt the decision to replace Thorpe with Pietersen the correct one. After announcing the squad England chairman of selectors David Graveney described it as \\"the most difficult decision that I have been party to in my time as a selector\\". Domestic career Thorpe played another two months with Surrey before following up his test retirement with his retirement from domestic cricket in August 2005. He served New South Wales as a batting coach in two seasons starting in 2005/6 and played for UTS- Balmain in the Sydney First Grade competition. Thorpe was named as assistant coach of New South Wales in 2007 replacing Matthew Mott who was promoted to the position of coach. Beyond cricket Thorpe was created a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) on 17 June 2006. He made his debut as a summariser for BBC Radio's Test Match Special programme during the first Test of India's 2007 tour of England. He also appeared as a match summariser on Sky Sports' highlights coverage for the same series. He wrote a monthly column for the UK-based cricket magazine, SPIN World Cricket Monthly.

Trusses did not come into common use until the Roman era. Typical detail of a steel truss, which is considered as a revolute joint Historical detail of a steel truss with an actual revolute joint A truss is an assembly of beams or other elements that creates a rigid structure. In engineering, a truss is a structure that \\"consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object\\". A \\"two-force member\\" is a structural component where force is applied to only two points. Although this rigorous definition allows the members to have any shape connected in any stable configuration, trusses typically comprise five or more triangular units constructed with straight members whose ends are connected at joints referred to as nodes. In this typical context, external forces and reactions to those forces are considered to act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members that are either tensile or compressive. For straight members, moments (torques) are explicitly excluded because, and only because, all the joints in a truss are treated as revolutes, as is necessary for the links to be two-force members. A planar truss is one where all members and nodes lie within a two-dimensional plane, while a space truss has members and nodes that extend into three dimensions. The top beams in a truss are called top chords and are typically in compression, the bottom beams are called bottom chords, and are typically in tension. The interior beams are called webs, and the areas inside the webs are called panels,Ching, Frank. A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. 2nd ed. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley, 2012. 277.

Characteristics  A truss consists of typically (but not necessarily) straight members connected at joints, traditionally termed panel points. Trusses are typically (but not necessarily) composed of triangles because of the structural stability of that shape and design. A triangle is the simplest geometric figure that will not change shape when the lengths of the sides are fixed. In comparison, both the angles and the lengths of a four-sided figure must be fixed for it to retain its shape. The joint at which a truss is designed to be supported is commonly referred to as the Munter Point. =Simple truss= Planar roof trusses The roof trusses of the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence The simplest form of a truss is one single triangle. This type of truss is seen in a framed roof consisting of rafters and a ceiling joist, and in other mechanical structures such as bicycles and aircraft. Because of the stability of this shape and the methods of analysis used to calculate the forces within it, a truss composed entirely of triangles is known as a simple truss. However, a simple truss is often defined more restrictively by demanding that it can be constructed through successive addition of pairs of members, each connected to two existing joints and to each other to form a new joint, and this definition does not require a simple truss to comprise only triangles. The traditional diamond-shape bicycle frame, which utilizes two conjoined triangles, is an example of a simple truss.Wingerter, R., and Lebossiere, P., ME 354, Mechanics of Materials Laboratory: Structures, University of Washington (February 2004), p.1 =Planar truss= A planar truss lies in a single plane. Planar trusses are typically used in parallel to form roofs and bridges. The depth of a truss, or the height between the upper and lower chords, is what makes it an efficient structural form. A solid girder or beam of equal strength would have substantial weight and material cost as compared to a truss. For a given span, a deeper truss will require less material in the chords and greater material in the verticals and diagonals. An optimum depth of the truss will maximize the efficiency. =Space frame truss= A space frame truss is a three- dimensional framework of members pinned at their ends. A tetrahedron shape is the simplest space truss, consisting of six members that meet at four joints. Large planar structures may be composed from tetrahedrons with common edges, and they are also employed in the base structures of large free-standing power line pylons.

A large timber Howe truss in a commercial building There are two basic types of truss: * The pitched truss, or common truss, is characterized by its triangular shape. It is most often used for roof construction. Some common trusses are named according to their \\"web configuration\\". The chord size and web configuration are determined by span, load and spacing. * The parallel chord truss, or flat truss, gets its name from its parallel top and bottom chords. It is often used for floor construction. A combination of the two is a truncated truss, used in hip roof construction. A metal plate-connected wood truss is a roof or floor truss whose wood members are connected with metal connector plates. =Warren truss= Warren truss Truss members form a series of equilateral triangles, alternating up and down. Main article: Warren truss =Octet truss= Truss members are made up of all equivalent equilateral triangles. The minimum composition is two regular tetrahedrons along with an octahedron. They fill up three dimensional space in a variety of configurations. =Pratt truss= Tempe Salt River Southern Pacific Railroad bridge Pratt truss The Pratt truss was patented in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers,Bethanga Bridge at the NSW Heritage Office; retrieved 2008-Feb-06 Caleb Pratt and his son Thomas Willis Pratt.A Brief History of Covered Bridges in Tennessee at the Tennessee Department of Transportation; retrieved 2008-Feb-06 The design uses vertical members for compression and diagonal members to respond to tension. The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel.The Pratt Truss courtesy of the Maryland Department of Transportation; retrieved 2008-Feb-6 This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is probably due to the fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to buckling under compression loads (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient under static, vertical loading. The Southern Pacific Railroad bridge in Tempe, Arizona is a 393 meter (1,291 foot) long truss bridge built in 1912.Tempe Historic Property Survey at the Tempe Historical Museum; retrieved 2008-Feb-06 The structure is composed of nine Pratt truss spans of varying lengths. The bridge is still in use today. The Wright Flyer used a Pratt truss in its wing construction, as the minimization of compression member lengths allowed for lower aerodynamic drag.Dario Gasparini, Case Western Reserve University. The Wright Brothers and the Pratt Truss, presentation slides =Bowstring truss= A bowstring truss is used on the oldest metal bridge in Virginia Named for their shape, bowstring trusses were first used for arched truss bridges, often confused with tied-arch bridges. Thousands of bowstring trusses were used during World War II for holding up the curved roofs of aircraft hangars and other military buildings. Many variations exist in the arrangements of the members connecting the nodes of the upper arc with those of the lower, straight sequence of members, from nearly isosceles triangles to a variant of the Pratt truss. =King post truss= King Post Truss One of the simplest truss styles to implement, the king post consists of two angled supports leaning into a common vertical support. Queen Post Truss The queen post truss, sometimes queenpost or queenspost, is similar to a king post truss in that the outer supports are angled towards the centre of the structure. The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the centre which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.Covered Bridge's Truss Types =Lenticular truss= The Waterville Bridge in Swatara State Park in Pennsylvania is a lenticular truss Lenticular trusses, patented in 1878 by William Douglas (although the Gaunless Bridge of 1823 was the first of the type), have the top and bottom chords of the truss arched, forming a lens shape. A lenticular pony truss bridge is a bridge design that involves a lenticular truss extending above and below the roadbed. =Town's lattice truss= Lattice Truss American architect Ithiel Town designed Town's Lattice Truss as an alternative to heavy-timber bridges. His design, patented in 1820 and 1835, uses easy-to-handle planks arranged diagonally with short spaces in between them, to form a lattice. =Vierendeel truss= A Vierendeel bridge, which lacks diagonal elements in the primary structure The Vierendeel truss is a structure where the members are not triangulated but form rectangular openings, and is a frame with fixed joints that are capable of transferring and resisting bending moments. As such, it does not fit the strict definition of a truss (since it contains non-two-force members): regular trusses comprise members that are commonly assumed to have pinned joints, with the implication that no moments exist at the jointed ends. This style of structure was named after the Belgian engineer Arthur Vierendeel,Vierendeel bruggen who developed the design in 1896. Its use for bridges is rare due to higher costs compared to a triangulated truss. The utility of this type of structure in buildings is that a large amount of the exterior envelope remains unobstructed and can be used for windows and door openings. In some applications this is preferable to a braced-frame system, which would leave some areas obstructed by the diagonal braces. Statics Cosmonaut Alexander Serebrov sets up an integrated truss structure \\"Rapana\\" at Mir space station, September 16, 1993 A truss that is assumed to comprise members that are connected by means of pin joints, and which is supported at both ends by means of hinged joints or rollers, is described as being statically determinate. Newton's Laws apply to the structure as a whole, as well as to each node or joint. In order for any node that may be subject to an external load or force to remain static in space, the following conditions must hold: the sums of all (horizontal and vertical) forces, as well as all moments acting about the node equal zero. Analysis of these conditions at each node yields the magnitude of the compression or tension forces. Trusses that are supported at more than two positions are said to be statically indeterminate, and the application of Newton's Laws alone is not sufficient to determine the member forces. In order for a truss with pin-connected members to be stable, it does not need to be entirely composed of triangles. In mathematical terms, we have the following necessary condition for stability of a simple truss: : m \\\\ge 2j - r \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(a)} where m is the total number of truss members, j is the total number of joints and r is the number of reactions (equal to 3 generally) in a 2-dimensional structure. When m=2j - 3, the truss is said to be statically determinate, because the (m+3) internal member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2j equilibrium equations, once we know the external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member is taken out (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the load carrying capacity of the members. Some structures are built with more than this minimum number of truss members. Those structures may survive even when some of the members fail. Their member forces depend on the relative stiffness of the members, in addition to the equilibrium condition described. Analysis Cremona diagram for a plane truss Because the forces in each of its two main girders are essentially planar, a truss is usually modeled as a two-dimensional plane frame. However if there are significant out-of-plane forces, the structure must be modeled as a three- dimensional space. The analysis of trusses often assumes that loads are applied to joints only and not at intermediate points along the members. The weight of the members is often insignificant compared to the applied loads and so is often omitted; alternatively, half of the weight of each member may be applied to its two end joints. Provided that the members are long and slender, the moments transmitted through the joints are negligible, and the junctions can be treated as \\"hinges\\" or \\"pin-joints\\". Under these simplifying assumptions, every member of the truss is then subjected to pure compression or pure tension forces ‚Äì shear, bending moment, and other more-complex stresses are all practically zero. Trusses are physically stronger than other ways of arranging structural elements, because nearly every material can resist a much larger load in tension or compression than in shear, bending, torsion, or other kinds of force. These simplifications make trusses easier to analyze. Structural analysis of trusses of any type can readily be carried out using a matrix method such as the direct stiffness method, the flexibility method, or the finite element method. =Forces in members= Illustrated is a simple, statically determinate flat truss with 9 joints and (2 x 9) ‚àí 3 = 15 members. External loads are concentrated in the outer joints. Since this is a symmetrical truss with symmetrical vertical loads, the reactive forces at A and B are vertical, equal, and half the total load. The internal forces in the members of the truss can be calculated in a variety of ways, including graphical methods: * Cremona diagram * Culmann diagram * Ritter analytical method (method of sections) =Design of members= A truss can be thought of as a beam where the web consists of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the bottom chord) and the upper horizontal member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the bottom chord is in tension, and the top chord in compression. The diagonal and vertical members form the truss web, and carry the shear stress. Individually, they are also in tension and compression, the exact arrangement of forces is depending on the type of truss and again on the direction of bending. In the truss shown above right, the vertical members are in tension, and the diagonals are in compression. Truss sections stabilize this building under construction in Shanghai and will house mechanical floors In addition to carrying the static forces, the members serve additional functions of stabilizing each other, preventing buckling. In the adjacent picture, the top chord is prevented from buckling by the presence of bracing and by the stiffness of the web members. The inclusion of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being a balance between the costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery and the cost of labor. In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as prestressed concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges. Once the force on each member is known, the next step is to determine the cross section of the individual truss members. For members under tension the cross-sectional area A can be found using A = F √ó Œ≥ / œÉy, where F is the force in the member, Œ≥ is a safety factor (typically 1.05 but depending on building codes) and œÉy is the yield tensile strength of the steel used. The members under compression also have to be designed to be safe against buckling. The weight of a truss member depends directly on its cross section‚Äîthat weight partially determines how strong the other members of the truss need to be. Giving one member a larger cross section than on a previous iteration requires giving other members a larger cross section as well, to hold the greater weight of the first member‚Äîone needs to go through another iteration to find exactly how much greater the other members need to be. Sometimes the designer goes through several iterations of the design process to converge on the \\"right\\" cross section for each member. On the other hand, reducing the size of one member from the previous iteration merely makes the other members have a larger (and more expensive) safety factor than is technically necessary, but doesn't require another iteration to find a buildable truss. The effect of the weight of the individual truss members in a large truss, such as a bridge, is usually insignificant compared to the force of the external loads. =Design of joints= After determining the minimum cross section of the members, the last step in the design of a truss would be detailing of the bolted joints, e.g., involving shear stress of the bolt connections used in the joints. Based on the needs of the project, truss internal connections (joints) can be designed as rigid, semi rigid, or hinged. Rigid connections can allow transfer of bending moments leading to development of secondary bending moments in the members. Applications A type of truss used in roofing =Post frame structures= Component connections are critical to the structural integrity of a framing system. In buildings with large, clearspan wood trusses, the most critical connections are those between the truss and its supports. In addition to gravity-induced forces (a.k.a. bearing loads), these connections must resist shear forces acting perpendicular to the plane of the truss and uplift forces due to wind. Depending upon overall building design, the connections may also be required to transfer bending moment. Wood posts enable the fabrication of strong, direct, yet inexpensive connections between large trusses and walls. Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, and may be influenced by post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.

The theorem states that an (Artinian) Semisimple rings are necessarily Artinian rings. Some authors use \\"semisimple\\" to mean the ring has a trivial Jacobson radical. For Artinian rings, the two notions are equivalent, so \\"Artinian\\" is included here to eliminate that ambiguity. semisimple ring R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many ni-by-ni matrix rings over division rings Di, for some integers ni, both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i. In particular, any simple left or right Artinian ring is isomorphic to an n-by-n matrix ring over a division ring D, where both n and D are uniquely determined. Also, the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem says that a semisimple algebra that is finite-dimensional over a field k is isomorphic to a finite product \\\\prod M_{n_i}(D_i) where the n_i are natural numbers, the D_i are finite dimensional division algebras over k (possibly finite extension fields of ), and M_{n_i}(D_i) is the algebra of n_i \\\\times n_i matrices over D_i. Again, this product is unique up to permutation of the factors. As a direct corollary, the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem implies that every simple ring that is finite-dimensional over a division ring (a simple algebra) is a matrix ring. This is Joseph Wedderburn's original result. Emil Artin later generalized it to the case of Artinian rings. Note that if R is a finite-dimensional simple algebra over a division ring E, D need not be contained in E. For example, matrix rings over the complex numbers are finite-dimensional simple algebras over the real numbers.  Consequence  The Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem reduces classifying simple rings over a division ring to classifying division rings that contain a given division ring. This in turn can be simplified: The center of D must be a field K. Therefore, R is a K-algebra, and itself has K as its center. A finite-dimensional simple algebra R is thus a central simple algebra over K. Thus the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem reduces the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central simple algebras to the problem of classifying division rings with given center.

The original Foresters groups allegedly banded together for mutual aid and protection in 14th-century England, in or near the ancient royal forests which belonged to the monarchy.Fraternally Yours: A History of the Independent Order of Foresters, Warren Potter and Robert Oliver (Queen Anne Press Ltd., London, 1967). Cited at the Marin County website below. Although the older history cannot be proven, there was a society called the Royal Foresters in the 18th century. Membership was originally gained by combat, first with quarterstaffs, then with swords and finally with cudgels, until initiation by combat was abandoned in 1843.Foresters in Marin County, California (freemasonry.biz) In 1834 the Royal Foresters formed a Friendly Society, the Ancient Order of Foresters (AOF).Foresters Friendly Society: Our History The IOF in the United States became independent of the AOF in 1874,135th Anniversary (1874-2009) , Independent Order of Foresters and operates a separate UK division, Forester Life, based in South London. The expansion of the Independent Order of Foresters (IOF) into Canada in 1875 is attributed to a prominent doctor and community leader, Oronhyatekha. Of Mohawk descent, born in 1841 at Six Nations near present-day Brantford, Ontario, Oronhyatekha (\\"Burning Sky\\") was baptized Peter Martin and later attended Oxford, where he became a medical doctor. Dr. Oronhyatekha held the office of Supreme Chief Ranger (now called \\"International Fraternal President\\") from 1879 until 1906; he died in 1907. By the early 1890s he had successfully transformed the Foresters into one of North America's leading fraternal benefit societies.Our Story at Foresters135.com Foresters membership reached 257,000 in 1906. Through the 20th century it amalgamated with various other fraternal organizations, including the Ontario part of one of the oldest, the Ancient Order of United Workmen. Like other friendly societies and fraternal organizations of the time, Foresters helped transform the insurance industry by extending insurance benefits to the average working family. In addition to admitting women as full members, Foresters provided orphan benefits to the children of deceased Foresters members. Historically, Foresters has also actively helped communities in need. Foresters supports various community causes in Canada, the US and UK, through direct investment in national and local community partnerships, branch funding and educational scholarships.

It is a type of panel study where the individuals in the panel share a common characteristic. Cohort studies represent one of the fundamental designs of epidemiology which are used in research in the fields of medicine, nursing, psychology, social science, and in any field reliant on 'difficult to reach' answers that are based on evidence (statistics). In medicine for instance, while clinical trials are used primarily for assessing the safety of newly developed pharmaceuticals before they are approved for sale, epidemiological analysis on how risk factors affect the incidence of diseases is often used to identify the causes of diseases in the first place, and to help provide pre- clinical justification for the plausibility of protective factors (treatments). Comparison with controlled trials Cohort studies differ from clinical trials in that no intervention, treatment, or exposure is administered to participants in a cohort design; and no control group is defined. Rather, cohort studies are largely about the life histories of segments of populations, and the individual people who constitute these segments. Exposures or protective factors are identified as preexisting characteristics of participants. The study is controlled by including other common characteristics of the cohort in the statistical analysis. Both exposure/treatment and control variables are measured at baseline. Participants are then followed over time to observe the incidence rate of the disease or outcome in question. Regression analysis can then be used to evaluate the extent to which the exposure or treatment variable contributes to the incidence of the disease, while accounting for other variables that may be at play. Double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally considered superior methodology in the hierarchy of evidence in treatment, because they allow for the most control over other variables that could affect the outcome, and the randomization and blinding processes reduce bias in the study design. This minimizes the chance that results will be influenced by confounding variables, particularly ones that are unknown. However, educated hypotheses based on prior research and background knowledge are used to select variables to be included in the regression model for cohort studies, and statistical methods can be used to identify and account potential confounders from these variables. Bias can also be mitigated in a cohort study when selecting participants for the cohort. It is also important to note that RCTs may not be suitable in all cases; such as when the outcome is a negative health effect and the exposure is hypothesized to be a risk factor for the outcome. Ethical standards, and morality, would prevent the use of risk factors in RCTs. The natural or incidental exposure to these risk factors (e.g. time spent in the sun), or self-administered exposure (e.g. smoking), can be measured without subjecting participants to risk factors outside of their individual lifestyles, habits, and choices.  Types  Cohort studies can be retrospective (looking back in time, thus using existing data such as medical records or claims database) or prospective (requiring the collection of new data). Retrospective cohort studies restrict the investigators ability to reduce confounding and bias because collected information is restricted to data that already exists. There are advantages to this design however, as retrospective studies are much cheaper and faster because the data has already been collected and stored. A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period (e.g., are currently living, are exposed to a drug or vaccine or pollutant, or undergo a certain medical procedure). Thus a group of people who were born on a day or in a particular period, say 1948, form a birth cohort. The comparison group may be the general population from which the cohort is drawn, or it may be another cohort of persons thought to have had little or no exposure to the substance under investigation, but otherwise similar. Alternatively, subgroups within the cohort may be compared with each other. Application In medicine, a cohort study is often undertaken to obtain evidence to try to refute the existence of a suspected association between cause and effect; failure to refute a hypothesis often strengthens confidence in it. Crucially, the cohort is identified before the appearance of the disease under investigation. The study groups follow a group of people who do not have the disease for a period of time and see who develops the disease (new incidence). The cohort cannot therefore be defined as a group of people who already have the disease. Prospective (longitudinal) cohort studies between exposure and disease strongly aid in studying causal associations, though distinguishing true causality usually requires further corroboration from further experimental trials. The advantage of prospective cohort study data is that it can help determine risk factors for contracting a new disease because it is a longitudinal observation of the individual through time, and the collection of data at regular intervals, so recall error is reduced. However, cohort studies are expensive to conduct, are sensitive to attrition and take a long follow-up time to generate useful data. Nevertheless, the results that are obtained from long-term cohort studies are of substantially superior quality to those obtained from retrospective/cross-sectional studies. Prospective cohort studies are considered to yield the most reliable results in observational epidemiology. They enable a wide range of exposure-disease associations to be studied. Some cohort studies track groups of children from their birth, and record a wide range of information (exposures) about them. The value of a cohort study depends on the researchers' capacity to stay in touch with all members of the cohort. Some studies have continued for decades. In a cohort study, the population under investigation consists of individuals who are at risk of developing a specific disease or health outcome. Examples An example of an epidemiological question that can be answered using a cohort study is whether exposure to X (say, smoking) associates with outcome Y (say, lung cancer). In 1951, commenced the British Doctors Study, a cohort that included both smokers (the exposed group) and non-smokers (the unexposed group). The study continued through 2001. By 1956, the study provided convincing proof of the association of smoking with the incidence of lung cancer. In a cohort study, the groups are matched in terms of many other variables such as economic status and other health status so that the variable being assessed, the independent variable (in this case, smoking) can be isolated as the cause of the dependent variable (in this case, lung cancer). In this example, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer in the smoking group as compared to the non-smoking group is evidence in favor of the hypothesis. However, rare outcomes, such as lung cancer, are generally not studied with the use of a cohort study, but are rather studied with the use of a case-control study. Shorter term studies are commonly used in medical research as a form of clinical trial, or means to test a particular hypothesis of clinical importance. Such studies typically follow two groups of patients for a period of time and compare an endpoint or outcome measure between the two groups. Randomized controlled trials, or RCTs, are a superior methodology in the hierarchy of evidence, because they limit the potential for bias by randomly assigning one patient pool to an intervention and another patient pool to non-intervention (or placebo). This minimizes the chance that the incidence of confounding variables will differ between the two groups. Nevertheless, it is sometimes not practical or ethical to perform RCTs to answer a clinical question. To take our example, if we already had reasonable evidence that smoking causes lung cancer then persuading a pool of non-smokers to take up smoking in order to test this hypothesis would generally be considered quite unethical. Two examples of cohort studies that have been going on for more than 50 years are the Framingham Heart Study and the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the most widely researched of the British birth cohort studies. Key findings of NCDS and a detailed profile of the study appear in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The Dunedin Longitudinal Study, started in 1975, has been studying the thousand people born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972‚Äì1973. The subjects are interviewed regularly, with Phase 45 starting in 2017. The largest cohort study in women is the Nurses' Health Study. Started in 1976, it is tracking over 120,000 nurses and has been analyzed for many different conditions and outcomes. The largest cohort study in Africa is the Birth to Twenty Study, which began in 1990 and tracks a cohort of over 3,000 children born in the weeks following Nelson Mandela's release from prison. Other famous examples are the Grant Study tracking a number of Harvard graduates from ca. 1950.77, the Whitehall Study tracking 10,308 British civil servants, and the Caerphilly Heart Disease Study, which since 1979 has studied a representative sample of 2,512 men, drawn from the Welsh town of Caerphilly.. The ASPREE-XT study is designed to determine whether there are long-lasting effects of an average of 4‚Äì5 years of treatment with daily low-dose aspirin, with outcome measures including cancer mortality. As of September 2018, there were 16,703 ASPREE-XT participants in Australia. Variations thumb The diagram indicates the starting point and direction of cohort and case-control studies. In Case-control studies the analysis proceeds from documented disease and investigations are made to arrive at the possible causes of the disease. In cohort studies the assessments starts with the putative cause of disease, and observations are made of the occurrence of disease relative to the hypothesized causal agent. =Current and historical cohorts= A current cohort study represents a true prospective study where the data concerning exposure are assembled prior to the occurrence of the fact to be studied, for instance a disease. An example of a current cohort study is the Oxford Family Planning Association Study in the United Kingdom, which aimed to provide a balanced view of the beneficial and harmful effects of different methods of contraception. This study has provided a large amount of information on the efficacy and safety of contraceptive methods, and in particular oral contraceptives (OCs), diaphragms and intrauterine device (IUDs). In a historical cohort study the data concerning exposure and occurrence of a disease, births, a political attitude or any other categorical variable are collected after the events have taken place, and the subjects (those exposed and unexposed to the agent under study) are assembled from existing records or health care registers. A \\"prospective cohort\\" defines the groups before the study is done, while historical studies, which are sometimes referred to as \\"retrospective cohort\\", defines the grouping after the data is collected. Examples of a retrospective cohort are Long-Term Mortality after Gastric Bypass Surgery and The Lothian Birth Cohort Studies. Although historical studies are sometimes referred to as retrospective study, it a misnomer as the methodological principles of historical cohort studies and prospective studies are the same. =Nested case-control study= A nested case-control study is a case control nested inside of a cohort study. The procedure begins like a normal cohort study, however, as participants develop the outcome of interest they are selected as cases. Once the cases are identified, controls are selected and matched to each case. The process for selecting and matching cases is identical to a normal case control study. An example of a nested case-control study is Inflammatory markers and the risk of coronary heart disease in men and women, which was a case control analyses extracted from the Framingham Heart Study cohort. Nested case-controls have the advantage of reducing the number of participants that require details follow up or diagnostic testing to assess outcome or exposure status. However, this will also reduce the power of the study, when compared to larger cohort the study population is drawn from. =Household panel survey= Household panel surveys are an important sub-type of cohort study. These draw representative samples of households and survey them, following all individuals through time on a usually annual basis. Examples include the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (since 1968), the German Socio-Economic Panel (since 1984), the British Household Panel Survey (since 1991), the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (since 2001) and the European Community Household Panel (1994‚Äì2001). =Cohort analysis in business= For an example in business analysis, see cohort analysis. =Synthetic pseudo panel analysis= Recently it has been demonstrated how very detailed cohorts can be analysed by generating synthetic pseudo panels. This can be used to investigate very detailed cohorts from cross-section data and to identify, e.g. people at risk across a large range of variables. This would otherwise not be possible in a conventional cohort analysis.

In the words of historian Benjamin Lossing, he \\"regarded the advent of the white men with a jealous fear\\", and he challenged the Plymouth colony in 1622 in front of a force of about 5,000 men. He sent a bundle of arrows in a leather wrap tied with a snake skin to Plymouth governor William Bradford, so Bradford filled the wrap with gunpowder and lead round shot and returned it to Canonicus. This first exposure to explosive powder and metal was met with \\"superstitious awe,\\" in the words of Lossing: > They were sent from village to village, and excited so much alarm, that the > sachem sued for peace, and made a treaty of friendship; which he never > violated, notwithstanding, he often received provocations that would have > justified him in scattering all compacts to the winds. The peace that resulted between the Narragansetts and the colonists extended beyond Canonicus's death in 1647. Roger Williams was driven from Massachusetts Bay Colony and sought refuge with the Narragansett tribe, and Canonicus made him welcome. In 1636, he gave Williams a large tract of land on which to establish Providence Plantations, the nucleus which became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In 1637, Canonicus was largely responsible for the Narragansetts' decision to side with the colonists during the Pequot War. Canonicus was initially succeeded by his nephew Miantonomoh, but Miantonomoh was killed in 1643 and Canonicus resumed leadership.An American Biographical and Historical Dictionary: Containing an Account of the Lives, Characters, and Writings of the Most Eminent Persons in North America from Its First Settlement, and a Summary of the History of the Several Colonies and of the United States By William Allen Edition: 2 Published by W.

Adcock studied Classics at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with an MA.  Career  Adcock worked as an assistant lecturer and later an assistant librarian at the University of Otago in Dunedin between 1958 and 1962 and at the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington in 1962‚Äì1963. In 1963, she returned to England and took up a post as an assistant librarian at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London until 1979 when she resigned to become a full-time writer, taking up the Northern Arts Literary Fellowship in Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham in 1979‚Äì81. Since then she has been a freelance writer, living in East Finchley, north London, a translator and poetry commentator for the BBC. Her first volume of poetry published in Britain was Tigers in 1967. Adcock's poetry is typically concerned with themes of place, human relationships and everyday activities, but frequently with a dark twist given to the mundane events she writes about. Formerly, her early work was influenced by her training as a classicist but her more recent work is looser in structure and more concerned with the world of the unconscious mind.  Personal life  Adcock was married to two notable New Zealand literary personalities. In August 1952, she married Alistair Campbell (divorced 1958), and in February 1962 she married Barry Crump, divorcing in 1963. She has two sons, Gregory and Andrew.

Miantonomoh (1600? ‚Äì August 1643), also spelled Miantonomo, Miantonomah or Miantonomi, was a chief of the Narragansett people of New England Indians. Biography He was a nephew of the Narragansett grand sachem, Canonicus (died 1647), with whom he associated in the government of the tribe, and whom he succeeded in 1636. Miantonomoh seems to have been friendly to the English colonists of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, though he was accused of being treacherous. In 1636, when under suspicion, Miantonomoh went to Boston to prove his loyalty to the colonists. In the following year, during the Pequot War, he permitted John Mason to lead his Connecticut expedition against the Pequot Indians through Narraganset country. The Pequot were defeated in this war. In 1638, he signed for the Narraganset the tripartite treaty between that tribe, the Connecticut colonists and the Mohegan Indians, which provided for a perpetual peace between the parties, and Miantonomoh was given control over eighty of the two hundred Pequot. However, conflict continued with the Mohegans over control of the Pequot people and land. Miantonomoh tried to organize other tribes throughout the English colonies in a union against the English. Miantonomo's Monument located in Sachem's Park, Norwich, Connecticut. The conflict with the Mohegans turned into a war in 1643. Miantonomoh invaded Mohegan territory with nearly 1,000 warriors, but was defeated. Miantonomoh was slowed by his coat of heavy armor and was taken prisoner. Miantonomoh suggested an alliance against the English to the sachem of the Mohegans, Uncas, but instead, Uncas brought him to Hartford to seek advice concerning further action from the Colonial Commissioners at their first meeting. Plaque marking Miantonomo's Monument. The commissioners of the United Colonies of New England, not knowing what to do, asked a committee of five clergymen from Boston, to whom his case was referred. Although Miantonomoh had made war with their consent, albeit from Gov. John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay colony who knew not much of the issues concerning the two Sachems, they suggested that he should be killed while admitting they had no authority to do so. Miantonomoh was taken back to Norwich, where he had been defeated, and killed with a tomahawk by Wawequa, the brother of Uncas. Family His son Canonchet was a Narragansett sachem. A daughter or granddaughter, Minnetinka, was raised and educated by a Dutch family after her mother died and her father Miantonomoh was killed by the Mohicans. She married John Corey with her Christian name being Elizabeth Gasesett.http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/s/l/o/Marty-Sloop- CA/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0209.html Legacy *Inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1997http://www.riheritagehalloffame.com/inductees_detail.cfm?iid=363 *Four ships in the United States Navy have been named for him, two as Miantonomoh and two as Miantonomah. *There is a monument to Miantonomo in Sachem's Park, Norwich, Connecticut. *Miantonomi Memorial Park in Newport, Rhode Island *A street named after him and his uncle, Canonicus, in bordering Middletown, Rhode Island.

Document signed by Uncas and his wife Early life and family Uncas was born near the Thames River in present-day Connecticut, the son of the Mohegan sachem Owaneco.Oberg, p. 38 Uncas is a variant of the Mohegan term Wonkus, meaning \\"Fox\\". He was a descendant of the principal sachems of the Mohegans, Pequots, and Narragansetts. Owaneco presided over the village known as Montonesuck. Uncas was bilingual, learning Mohegan and some English, and possibly some Dutch. In 1626, Owaneco arranged for Uncas to marry the daughter of the principal Pequot sachem Tatobem to secure an alliance with them. Owaneco died shortly after this marriage, and Uncas had to submit to Tatobem's authority. Tatobem was captured and killed by the Dutch in 1633; Sassacus became his successor, but Uncas felt that he deserved to be sachem. Owaneco's alliance with Tatobem was based upon a balance of power between the Mohegans and Pequots. After the death of Owaneco, the balance changed in favour of the Pequots. Uncas was unwilling to challenge the power of Tatobem; however, Uncas did begin contesting Pequot authority over the Mohegans. In 1634 with Narragansett support, Uncas rebelled against Sassacus and Pequot authority. Uncas was defeated and became an exile among the Narragansetts. He soon returned from exile after ritually humiliating himself before Sassacus. His failed challenges resulted in Uncas having little land and few followers, but Uncas saw that the English Puritan new arrivals, though few in number, had better weapons and much courage, so he started to develop a new strategy and alliance to work towards his ultimate goal of Grand Sachem. Pequot War About 1635, Uncas developed relationships with important Englishmen in Connecticut. He was a trusted ally of Captain John Mason, a partnership which lasted three and a half decades and several family generations beyond. Uncas sent word to Jonathan Brewster that Sassacus was planning to attack the English on the Connecticut River. Brewster described Uncas as being \\"faithful to the English\\".Oberg, p. 52 In 1637, during the Pequot War, Uncas was allied with the English and against the Pequots. He led his Mohegans in a joint attack with the English against the Pequots near Saybrook and against the Pequot Fort at Mystic River. The Pequots were defeated and the Mohegans incorporated much of the remaining Pequot people and their land. In the 1638 Treaty of Hartford, Uncas made the Mohegans a tributary of the Connecticut River Colony. The treaty dictated that Uncas could pursue his interests in the Pequot country only with the explicit approval of the Connecticut English. The Mohegans had become a regional power. In 1640, Uncas added Sebequanash of the Hammonassets to his several wives. This marriage gave Uncas some type of control over their land which he promptly sold to the English. The Hammonassets moved and became Mohegans. War with the Narragansett The Mohegans were in continuous conflict with the Narragansetts over control of the former Pequot land. In the summer of 1643, this conflict turned into war. The Mohegans defeated a Narragansett invasion force of around 1,000 men and captured their sachem Miantonomo. Uncas executed several of Miantonomo's fellow warriors in front of him, trying to solicit a response from Miantonomo. Consistent with the 1638 treaty, he turned Miantonomo over to the English. The English put him on trial where he was found guilty. Uncas requested and was given authority to put Miantonomo to death, provided that the killing was done by Indian hands in Indian territory to prevent difficulties between the Narragansetts and the English. Miantonomo subsequently escaped from the Mohegan village where he was being held and jumped Yantic Falls in escape of the pursuing Mohegans. This site is also known as Indian Leap. Uncas' brother Wawequa, leading the pursuit, caught up to Miantonomo and struck him a fatal blow to the back of his head with a tomahawk. A monument stands near the site of Miantonomo's death. The exact location is unknown, since stones marking the original location of Miantonomo's grave were allegedly used by early settlers to construct a barn. Author James Fenimore Cooper portrayed a fictional Uncas as having made the leap over the falls in his 1826 book \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\". Narragansett sachem Pessachus proposed to go to war to avenge the death of Miantonomo, but the English pledged to support the Mohegans. The English colonies in the New England Confederation formed an alliance with the Mohegans for their defense. The Narragansett attacks started in June 1644. With each success, the number of Narragansett allies grew. In 1645, Uncas and the Mohegans were under siege in Fort Shantok at Shattuck's Point and on the verge of a complete defeat when the English relieved them with supplies, led by Thomas Tracy and Thomas Leffingwell,Mahan, Russell, Thomas Leffingwell: The Connecticut Pioneer Who Rescued Chief Uncas and the Mohegans; Historical Enterprises, Santa Clara, Utah, 2018. and lifted the siege. The New England Confederation pledged any offensive action required to preserve Uncas in \\"his liberty and estate\\". The English sent troops to defend the Mohegan fort at Shantok. When the English threatened to invade Narragansett territory, the Narragansett signed a peace treaty. In 1646, the tributary tribe at Nameag, consisting of former Pequots, allied with the English and tried to become more independent. In response, Uncas attacked and plundered their village. The Bay Colony governor responded by threatening to allow the Narragansetts to attack the Mohegans. For the next several years, the English both asserted the Nameag's tributary status while supporting the Nameags in their independence. In 1655, the English removed the tribe from Uncas' authority. King Philip's War King Philip's War started in June 1675. In the summer, the Mohegans entered the war on the side of the English. Uncas led his forces in joint attacks with the English against the Wampanoags. In December, the Mohegans with the English attacked the Narragansetts. The Mohegans ended their active support of the English in this war in July 1676. Uncas died sometime between June 1683 and June 1684 in Norwich, New London County, Connecticut.

Thus left-wing politics oppose right-wing politics -- after the seating habits on the left and right sides of French assemblies in the late 18th century. Also from France comes the political grouping known as The Mountain - originally the occupants of higher seats in a chamber. The British Westminster tradition of parliamentary debate involves rows of benches facing each other in a confrontational manner. Some see this as discouraging consensus and compromise. While the opposing Members of Parliament may well espouse mutually opposed left-wing and right-wing views, the official division lies not between left and right but between Government and Opposition, with everyone aiming to sit on the Government side, and individuals often hoping to move in their careers from the back benches to the front benches - occupied by the leadership of each faction. Members falling out with their fellows on some issue cross the floor to vote with their erstwhile political enemies. Note that some modern parliaments, such as the German Bundestag, attempt to de-polarise extremes by seating arrangements. Church politics sometimes employ a different spatial paradigm: Low Church contrasts with High Church. Continuing the vertical theme, a church party may get dubbed Ultramontane.

Biography  Bust of Baudin in Albany, Western Australia = Early career = Born a commoner in Saint-Martin-de-R√© on the √éle de R√© on 17 February 1754, Baudin joined the merchant navy as an apprentice (pilotin) at the age of 15; he was then \\"of average height with brown hair\\". He then joined the French East India Company at the age of 20 on the Flamand. He returned from India on L'√âtoile and arrived at Lorient. At the beginning of 1778, he was to set sail from Nantes on the Lion as Second Lieutenant. It was a ship equipped by his uncle Jean Peltier Dudoyer, at the request of the Americans, which would become a privateer and be renamed the Deane. At first the Minister for the Navy was against it, but he finally changed his mind and authorised the departure, as France had signed a treaty with America on 6 February. Since the atmosphere between the French and American crews on the Lion became unbearable, Nicolas Baudin was assigned by Lamotte-Picquet to the Duc de Choiseul, a ship equipped by Jean Peltier Dudoyer. Officially it was heading for Saint-Domingue, but in fact the destination was Nova Scotia. However the vessel was shipwrecked at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Nicolas was wounded, taken prisoner by the English on 24 April 1778 and interned in Halifax, Canada. After one month he escaped with 10 other prisoners and hid among the friendly communities of Acadia. Appointed Captain of the transport vessel Amphitrite, he was sunk by the English 60 leagues out to sea, rescued in a rowing boat and made his way to Cape Cod and then Boston. As captain of the Revanche, 400 tons, equipped by Jeange and sons of Bordeaux, with 30 men and 12 cannon, he was retaken by the English outside Cap-Fran√ßais, heading for Boston. He was taken to Jamaica as a prisoner, then exchanged at the request of the Comte d'Argout, the Governor of Saint- Domingue. He returned to France on board the frigate Minerve, under the command of Captain de Grimouard, who was later guillotined at Rochefort under the Convention. Back in France, he was appointed Captain at the admiralty of La Rochelle on 2 March 1780 and was to sail in merchant ships. At the age of 27 he was named Captain of the Apollon, a civilian frigate of 1,100 tons and 42 cannon, fitted out by Jean Peltier Dudoyer. He was to form part of the convoy which took the Legion of Luxembourg to strengthen the defence of the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope. However, during a stopover in Brest, the Comte d'Hector decided he would appoint a man with more experience, Felix de Saint-Hilaire. Having returned to Nantes and to the annoyance of Beaumarchais, the owner of the vessel, Baudin's uncle entrusted him with the command of the Aimable Eugenie, a ship of 600 tons, to go to Saint-Domingue and then to the United States. He went back to Bordeaux and left the Gironde on 12 December 1782. He was part of a convoy of five merchant vessels attacked by an English ship, the Mediator. After a hard battle Nicolas Baudin escaped, but the two other ships owned by Beaumarchais were captured. Reaching Saint- Domingue, the boat sank on 23 March 1783 at Puerto Plata, but the freight was saved. He negotiated for it and set off once again for Nantes on 23 April on the Prince Royal, which he had bought on the spot. On 30 August he resold the boat, which in the meantime had become the Union des 6 Fr√®res, to Robert Pitot, a shipbuilder from the Isle de France who had just been freed from an English prison, and established himself as a trader in Bordeaux. The insurance company reimbursed Beaumarchais through his shipbuilder Peltier Dudoyer. On 16 April 1784 Baudin left once more for Saint-Domingue on the Comte d'Angevillier of 1,000 tons with 8 cannon, and built by Jean Peltier. He was still accompanied by his brother Alexandre as first mate. They were now 29 and 27 years old. Nicolas had a 25% stake in the voyage. They returned to Nantes on 8 December 1784. On 21 April 1785, he wrote to Benjamin Franklin requesting a recommendation to be accepted as a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He signed his letter 'Commander of the private frigate Comte d'Angevilliers, Maison Peltier du Doyer quai de l'h√¥pital'. On 22 July 1785 the Baudin brothers bought the Caroline, a ship of 200 tons, built by the Th√©baudi√®re brothers. He was to take the last Acadians to Louisiana. He was a few months behind his brother Alexandre who was captain of the Saint Remy, built by Jean Peltier Dudoyer. In La Nouvelle Orl√©ansCarl A. Brasseaux, The Founding of New Acadia: The Beginnings of Acadian Life in Louisiana, 1765‚Äì1803, Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University Press, 1987, p109; William Dawson Gerrior, Acadian Awakenings: Louisiana, Port Royal Pub., 2003, pp.73, 104; Madeleine Ly-Tio- Fane, Le G√©ographe et le Naturaliste √† l'√Æle-de-France: ultime escale du capitaine Baudin, Port-Louis, Ile Maurice, 2003, p.33. local merchants contracted him to take a cargo of wood, salted meat, cod and flour to Isle de France (now Mauritius), which he did in Josephine (also called Pepita), departing New Orleans on 14 July 1786 and arriving at Isle de France on 27 March 1787. In the course of the voyage, Josephine had called at Cap‚ÄëFran√ßais in Haiti to make a contract to transport slaves there from Madagascar; while in Haiti he also encountered the Austrian botanist Franz Josef Maerter, who apparently informed him that another Austrian botanist, Franz Boos, was at the Cape of Good Hope awaiting a ship to take him to Mauritius. Josephine called at the Cape and took Boos on board.David K. Wetherbee, Further Contributions to the History of Zoology in Hispaniola, Shelburne, Massachusetts, 1987. At Mauritius, Boos chartered Baudin to transport him and the collection of plant specimens he had gathered there and at the Cape back to Europe, which Baudin did, Josephine arriving at Trieste on 18 June 1788.S√©bastien Brunner (ed.), Correspondances intimes de l'Empereur Joseph II avec son ami le comte de Cobenzl et son premier ministre le prince de Kaunitz, Mainz, Kirchheim, 1871, p.75.Wiener Zeitung, 18 Juni 1788, p.1494 The Imperial government in Vienna was contemplating organizing another natural-history expedition, to which Boos would be appointed, in which two ships would be sent to the Malabar and Coromandel coasts of India, the Persian Gulf, Bengal, Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Cochin China, Tongking, Japan and China. Baudin had been given reason to hope that he would be given command of the ships of this expedition.Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, Le G√©ographe et le Naturaliste √† l'√Æle-de- France 1801, 1803 : ultime escale du capitaine Baudin, Port-Louis, Ile Maurice, 2003, pp.50‚Äì51; S√©bastien Brunner (ed.), Correspondances intimes de l'Empereur Joseph II avec son Ami le Comte de Cobenzl et son Premier Ministre le Prince de Kaunitz, Mainz, Kirchheim, 1871, p.75. = Austrian expeditions = Later in 1788 Baudin sailed on a commercial voyage from Trieste to Canton in Jardini√®re. He apparently arrived at Canton from Mauritius under the flag of the United States of America, probably to avoid the possibility of having his ship seized by the Chinese for payment of the debts owed them by the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste.Hosea Ballou Morse, The Chronicles of the East India Company Trading to China, 1635‚Äì1834, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1926, Vol.II, p.174. From there, he sent Jardini√®re under her second captain on a fur-trading venture to the north-west coast of America, but the ship foundered off Asuncion Island in the Northern Marianas Islands in late 1789.Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, \\"Contacts between Sch√∂nbrunn and the Jardin du Roi at Isle de France (Mauritius) in the 18th Century\\", Mitteilungen des Oesterreichischen Staatsarchiv, No.35, 1982, pp.85‚Äì109, p.102; Frank Horner, The French reconnaissance: Baudin in Australia, 1801‚Äì1803, Melbourne University Press, 1987, p.26. Baudin made his way to Mauritius, where he purchased a replacement ship, Jardini√®re II, but this vessel was wrecked in a cyclone that struck Port Louis on 15 December 1789. Baudin embarked on the Spanish Royal Philippines Company ship, Placeres, which sailed from Port Louis for Cadiz in August 1790. Placeres called at the Cape of Good Hope where it took on board the large number of plant and animal specimens collected in South Africa for the Imperial palace at Sch√∂nbrunn by Georg Scholl, the assistant of Franz Boos. Because of the poor condition of the ship, Placeres had to put in at the island of Trinidad in the West Indies, where Scholl's collection of specimens was deposited.Gazeta de Madrid, 19 de Julio de 1791, p.501. Baudin proceeded to Martinique, from where he addressed an offer to the Imperial government in Vienna to conduct to Canton commissioners who would be empowered to negotiate with the Chinese merchants there a settlement of the debts incurred by the Imperial Asiatic Company, which would enable the company to renew its trade with China. On its return voyage from Canton, the proposed expedition would call at the Cape of Good Hope to pick up Scholl and the remainder of his natural-history collection for conveyance to Sch√∂nbrunn. After returning to Vienna in September 1791, Baudin continued to press his case for an expedition under the Imperial flag to the Indian Ocean and China, and in January 1792 he was granted a commission of captain in the Imperial navy for this purpose. A ship, called Jardini√®re, was acquired and the botanists Franz Bredemeyer and Joseph van der Schot appointed to the expedition. After delays caused by the outbreak of war between France and Austria (April 1792), Jardini√®re departed from the Spanish port of M√°laga on 1 October 1792.Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, \\"Contacts between Sch√∂nbrunn and the Jardin du Roi at Isle de France (Mauritius) in the 18th Century\\", Mitteilungen des Oesterreichischen Staatsarchiv, No.35, 1982, pp.85‚Äì109. From the Cape of Good Hope Jardini√®re sailed across the Indian Ocean to the coast of New Holland (Australia), but two consecutive cyclones prevented the expedition from doing any work there and forced Baudin to take the ship to Bombay for repairs. From Bombay the expedition proceeded to the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa, where it gathered botanical and zoological collections. The expedition came to an abrupt end in June 1794 when Jardini√®re went aground in a storm while attempting to enter Table Bay at the Cape of Good Hope. Baudin survived the wreck and made his way to the United States, from where he went to France.Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, \\"Contacts between Sch√∂nbrunn and the Jardin du Roi at Isle de France (Mauritius) in the 18th Century\\", Mitteilungen des Oesterreichischen Staatsarchiv, No.35, 1982, pp.85‚Äì109, p.102; Frank Horner, The French reconnaissance: Baudin in Australia, 1801‚Äì1803, Melbourne University Press, 1987, p.28. As the Cape had been occupied by the English in June 1795, Nicolas Baudin went back to New England. On 23 November 1795, Nicolas set sail from New York as a passenger on board the American ship, Ocean, under the command of Captain Vredemburgh and also accompanied by General de Rochambeau, the Governor of Saint Lucia, the French Consul in Boston and a colonial trader from Saint-Domingue, Jean Baptiste Rivi√®re de la Souch√®re (known as Souch√®re-Rivi√®re). They arrived in Le Havre on 21 December 1795. Nicolas Baudin believed that he was expected and offered his services and his talents. He wrote to the Minister to give notice of his imminent arrival in Paris. He would have been somewhat disappointed had he seen the little note at the top of the letter 'Could Bonneville please tell me if he knows Captain Baudin and for which mission he was responsible?' He managed to send Jardini√®res cargo of natural history specimens to the island of Trinidad. = Belle Ang√©lique Expedition = In Paris, Baudin visited Antoine de Jussieu at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris in March 1796 to suggest a botanical voyage to the Caribbean, during which he would recover the collection of specimens he had left in Trinidad. The Museum and the French government accepted the proposal, and Baudin was appointed commander of an expedition in the ship Belle Ang√©lique, with four assigned botanists: Ren√© Maug√©, Andr√© Pierre Ledru, Anselme Riedl√© and Stanislas Levillain. Belle Ang√©lique cleared Le Havre on 30 September 1796 for the Canary Islands, where the ship was condemned as unseaworthy. The expedition sailed from the Canaries in a replacement vessel, Fanny, and reached Trinidad in April 1797. The British, who had just captured the island from the Spanish in February 1797, refused to allow Baudin to recover the collection of natural-history specimens. Baudin took Fanny to St. Thomas and St. Croix, and then to Puerto Rico, specimens being collected in all three islands. At St Croix, Fanny was replaced by a newly purchased ship, renamed Belle Angelique.Madeleine Ly-Tio- Fane, \\"A reconnaissance of tropical resources during Revolutionary years: the role of the Paris Museum d'Histoire Naturelle\\", Archives of Natural History, vol.18, 1991, pp. 352‚Äì355. The expedition returned to France in June 1798 with a large collection of plants, birds and insects, which was incorporated into Napoleon Bonaparte's triumphal procession, on 27 July, celebrating his recent Italian victories.Andr√© Pierre Ledru, Voyage aux iles de Teneriffe, la Trinite, Saint-Thomas Sainte-Croix et Porto Ricco, Paris, Bertrand, 1810; Nicolas Baudin, Voyage aux Antilles de La Belle Ang√©lique, √©dition √©tablie et comment√©e par Michel Jangoux, pr√©face du contre-amiral Georges Prud'homme, Paris, PUPS, coll. ¬´ Imago mundi-Textes ¬ª, 2009. On the recommendation of the Naval Minister to the Directory, Nicolas Baudin was reinstated into the navy with the rank of Chief of Staff to Admiral Bruix, who at his request, granted to Marie-Etienne Peltier the command of a corsair, the Virginie. Baudin joined Bruix on the vessel the Oc√©an, on which Bruix was in charge of the squadron which resupplied Genoa. Model of , now exhibited at the Ernest Cognacq Museum in Saint-Martin-de-R√© in Charente-Maritime, France. On 24 July 1798, at the suggestion of the Ministry of Marine, Baudin presented to the Assembly of Professors and Administrators of the National Museum of Natural History a plan for a hydrographic-survey expedition to the South Seas, which would include a search for fauna and flora that could be brought back for cultivation in France. The expedition would also have the aim of promoting the economic and commercial interests of France in the regions to be visited. The expedition would require two well-equipped ships, which would carry a team of astronomers, naturalists and scientific draughtsmen over whom Baudin as commander would have absolute authority. The first part of the voyage would be devoted to a thorough exploration of the coast of Chile and the collection of animal, bird and plant specimens suitable for acclimatization in France, followed by a survey of the coasts from Peru to Mexico. The expedition would then continue into the Pacific Ocean, including a visit to Tahiti and the Society Islands, and would be completed with a survey of the yet unexplored south-west coast of New Holland (Australia).Baudin aux Citoyens Professeurs et Adminitstrateurs du Museum nationale d‚Äôhistoire naturelle √† Paris, 6 Thermidor An VI [24 Juillet 1798], Archives nationales, Paris, AJXV 569, ff.178‚Äì179; cited in Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, \\"A reconnaissance of tropical resources during Revolutionary years: the role of the Paris Museum d'Histoire Naturelle\\", Archives of Natural History, vol.18, 1991, pp.333‚Äì362, p.358. After considering this extensive proposal, the French government decided to proceed with an expedition confined to a survey of western and southern New Holland (as Australia was called at the time). = New Holland Expedition = Discussion of Baudin and Matthew Flinders' race to map Australia. In October 1800 Baudin was selected by Bonaparte to lead what has become known as the Baudin expedition to map the coast of Australia (New Holland). He had two ships, and captained by Hamelin, and a suite of nine zoologists and botanists, including Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour. Nicolas Baudin left Le Havre on 19 October 1800, stopped off in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, then sailed straight to the Ile de France arriving on 15 March 1801, 145 days later. The voyage, overlong with early rationing left sailors and scientists feeling discouraged, but the colony was happy to build up the crews in case of conflict and to make use of the new skills they brought with them. He reached Australia in May 1801, and would explore and map the western coast and a part of the little-known southern coast of the continent. The scientific expedition proved a great success, with more than 2500 new species discovered. The French also met Aboriginal peoples and treated them with great respect. In April 1802 Baudin met Matthew Flinders, also engaged in charting the coastline, in Encounter Bay in present-day South Australia. Baudin then stopped at the British colony at Sydney for supplies, and from there he sent home the Naturaliste, carrying all of the specimens that had been collected by both ships up to that time. Realising that the G√©ographe could not venture into some of the shallow waters along the Australian coast that he was intending to survey, he bought a new ship ‚Äî ‚Äî named after the wood it was made from, and placed it under the command of Louis de Freycinet, who would 15 years later make his own circumnavigation in the corvette l'Uranie. He then headed back to Tasmania, before continuing along the southern and western coasts of Australia to Timor, mapping as he went. In very poor health, he then turned for home, stopping at Mauritius, where he died. According to recent researches by academics from the University of Adelaide, during Baudin's expedition, Fran√ßois P√©ron, who had become the chief zoologist and intellectual leader of the mission, wrote a report for Napoleon on ways to invade and capture the British colony at Sydney Cove. Death Baudin died of tuberculosis at Mauritius on 16 September 1803, at the age of 49, apparently in the home of Madame Alexandrine Kerivel. Baudin's exact resting place is not known, but the historian Auguste Toussaint believed that he was interred in the Kerivel family vault. These were his last wishes: \\"He gives and bequeaths to citizen Augustin Baudin, his brother, currently in India, his silver marine watch, his night telescope and an 'Oriental Neptune'. He gives and bequeaths to Citizen Ronsin, wife of Citizen Louis Peltier, his porcelain from Saxony and Chantilly, consisting of three services, one of twelve cups, one of six and one of two pieces plus his gold watch. He names as the Executor of his will Citizen Louis Peltier (brother of Jean Peltier Dudoyer), Judge of the Court of Appeal of this colony, to whom he entrusts the execution of the present document wishing and expecting that his goods be distrained in accordance with usual custom.\\" However, the historian Edward Duyker likes to think that Baudin was buried in Le Cimeti√®re de l‚ÄôOuest in the district of Port Louis, \\"just a few hundred metres from the explorer‚Äôs certain love: the sea\\".Duyker, E.

This style of clothing became popular in African- American, Latino, Italian American, and Filipino American communities during the 1940s.Walker, John. (1992) \\"Zoot suits\\". Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945, 3rd. ed. Retrieved 19 January 2012. The zoot suit originated in an African American comedy show in the 1930s and was popularized by jazz singers. Cab Calloway called them \\"totally and truly American\\", and a young Malcolm X wore them. During the shortages and rationing of World War II, they were criticized as a wasteful use of cloth, wool being rationed then. After zoot suit wearers were victims of repeated mob violence, the suits were prohibited for the duration of the war.  History  One of Cab Calloway's zoot suits on display in Baltimore's City Hall, October 2007 thumb The zoot suit was created by Ernest \\"Skillet\\" Mayhand during his shows as a part of the comedy act \\"Pots, Pans & Skillet\\" an act that ran on the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\". The suits were first associated in African-American communities such as Harlem, Chicago, and Detroit in the 1930s, but were made popular nationwide by jazz musicians in the 1940s. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \\"zoot\\" probably comes from a reduplication of suit. The creation and naming of the zoot suit have been variously attributed to Harold C. Fox, a Chicago clothier and big-band trumpeter; Charles Klein and Vito Bagnato of New York City;Clipping from The Daily Telegram (Adrian, Michigan), June 28, 1943, p. 8. Louis Lettes, a Memphis tailor; and Nathan (Toddy) Elkus, a Detroit retailer. Jazz bandleader Cab Calloway frequently wore zoot suits on stage, including some with exaggerated details, such as extremely wide shoulders or overly draped jackets. He wore one in the 1943 film Stormy Weather. In his dictionary, Cab Calloway's Cat-ologue: A \\"Hepster's\\" Dictionary (1938), he called the zoot suit \\"the ultimate in clothes. The only totally and truly American civilian suit.\\" thumb \\"A Zoot Suit (For My Sunday Gal)\\" was a 1942 song written by L. Wolfe Gilbert and Bob O'Brien.Azizi Powell, \\"Two Examples of the 1942 Song 'Zoot Suit (For My Sunday Gal). Pancojams, February 12, 2014. In 1943, there were a series of racist anti-Mexican youth riots in Los Angeles known as the Zoot Suit Riots. Norris J. Nelson, Los Angeles City Council member, proposed outlawing zoot suits after the Riots. The suits worn were seen by some as unpatriotic because of the amount of fabric they used, and zoot suits later became prohibited for the duration of the Second World War,\\"People & Events: The Zoot Suit Riots of 1943\\", The American Experience; retrieved June 5, 2013. ostensibly because of their wastefulness of cloth.Use of cloth had already been limited; zoot suits were also seen as unpatriotic. War, Politics & Suits: The Zoot Suit, Duchess Clothier; retrieved June 5, 2013. The Tom & Jerry cartoon short The Zoot Cat (1944) spoofs the trend with Tom trying to impress a girl (Toots) by wearing a zoot suit.https://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/cartoon.cgi?film=4971 Pachuco was a style of Mexican-American dress and culture which was associated with the zoot suit. Tin-Tan, a famous Mexican actor from the 1940s, wore zoot suits in his films. Labor leader Cesar Chavez sported zoot suit attire in his younger years. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt expressed that the motive behind targeting Mexican American youth wearing Zoot Suits was racially charged. The 38th Street gang was a Los Angeles street gang known for wearing the zoot suit in the 1940s. Zoot suits not only played a historical role in the subculture in the United States in the 1940s, but also shaped a new generation of men in Trinidad. These Trinidadian men who adopted this American fashion became referred to as the \\"saga boys\\"; they wore these suits and embraced the glamorous lifestyle that they represented. \\"Their fondness for the zoot suit, in particular signified a rejection of Anglo-centric precepts not only about fashion but, more profoundly, about manhood\\". Therefore, although the \\"saga boys\\" had the appearance of adapting to the urban American way of life, they were in fact using this clothing and lifestyle as a way to improve their lives in Trinidad, rise above the restrictions that imperialism brought and create through this oppositional dress, a culture of their own. thumb In the 1951 Three Stooges short \\"Three Arabian Nuts\\", Shemp finds a magic lamp complete with a genie (whom Shemp refers to as the 'Genuis'). His first wish is for a sharp, new suit. The wish is promptly granted, leaving an overjoyed Shemp dressed in a spanking new zoot suit, complete with a long watch chain. Some observers claim that the \\"Edwardian-look\\" suits with velvet lapels worn by Teddy Boys in Britain are a derivative of the zoot suit. Characteristics Five men in modernized zoot suits, Harry, Barry, Gary, Larry and Cary Teds wearing locally tailored imitations of the zoot suit Traditionally, zoot suits have been worn with a fedora or pork pie hat color-coordinated with the suit, occasionally with a long feather as decoration, and pointy, French-style shoes. A young Malcolm X, who wore zoot suits in his youth, described the zoot suit as: \\"a killer-diller coat with a drape shape, reet pleats, and shoulders padded like a lunatic's cell\\". Zoot suits usually featured a watch chain dangling from the belt to the knee or below, then back to a side pocket. A woman accompanying a man wearing a zoot suit would commonly wear a flared skirt and a long coat. The amount of material and tailoring required made them luxury items, so much so that the U.S. War Production Board said that they wasted materials that should be devoted to the World War II war effort. When Life published photographs of zoot suiters in 1942, the magazine joked that they were \\"solid arguments for lowering the Army draft age to include 18-year- olds\\". This extravagance, which many considered unpatriotic in wartime, was a factor in the Zoot Suit Riots. To some, wearing the oversized suit was a declaration of freedom and self-determination, even rebelliousness. Kelley, Robin, Seven Songs for Malcolm X, 1993, film by John Akomfrah.

Political history  McAllion was originally a member of the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) that was formed in 1976 by Jim Sillars, when the SLP collapsed he chose to join the Labour Party (unlike Sillars who joined the Scottish National Party). A teacher by profession, McAllion became a Labour member of Tayside regional council of which he became the convenor in 1986. In the 1987 general election McAllion was elected Labour MP for the Dundee East constituency, defeating SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who had been the sitting MP since 1974. McAllion was a member of Scottish Labour Action, putting him on the Scottish nationalist wing of the Labour Party, and of the Campaign for Socialism, placing him firmly on the left of the party. As befitted a member of the Scottish Labour Action group he strongly favoured home rule for Scotland, and was often outspoken in his defence of civic-minded Scottish nationalism. In 1999 he was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent Dundee East. As an MSP, he furthered his reputation as a left-winger, rebelling several times against the Labour-led Scottish Executive. He was also convenor of the Scottish Parliament's Petitions Committee. In 2000 he helped establish the Scottish Left Review publication. At the 2003 parliament election he lost his seat to Shona Robison, the SNP candidate. The Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) pulled out of contesting the seat in favour of McAllion, but ironically this may have assisted his defeat. Since the election defeat, McAllion resigned his membership of the Labour Party, subsequently joining the Scottish Socialist Party. On 9 February 2006, McAllion stood for the SSP in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, coming fifth place with 1.6% of the vote. He was elected to the SSP executive at its conference in March 2006. He was elected co-chair (along with Morag Balfour) at its conference in October 2007, but he stood down during his term of office for personal reasons. However, he remains active in campaigning with the party, particularly in the run-up to the independence referendum.

The estate was built either side of World War II to house families from the overcrowded inner city. Housing 30,000 at its peak, its population has since declined due to the replacement of substandard housing with lower-density accommodation. The main features of the area are the nearby Pollok Country Park, where the Burrell Collection is now housed, the ruins of Crookston Castle (within the north part of residential Pollok) which Mary, Queen of Scots once visited, and the Silverburn Centre, one of Glasgow's major indoor retail complexes. Location The country park and the White Cart Water which flows through it form the northern and eastern boundary of the district, with Corkerhill and Cardonald the closest northern suburbs. Recent developments in the late 20th and early 21st century have created an adjoining neighbourhood to the west of Pollok at Crookston, Glasgow, stretching from Rosshall to Roughmussel and including conversions of the original buildings of Leverndale Hospital, alongside its newer facilities. Haugh Hill Woodlandhill The Dragon of Haughhill, Owen Pilgrim, February 2015 partially provides a natural barrier between Pollok and Crookston. the Levern Water, a tributary of the White Cart, flows through Pollok from the south-west where the Househillwood and Priesthill residential areas are situated, with the Brock Burn bordering them and meeting the Levern Water in the centre of Pollok. In some contexts these neighbourhoods are referred to as separate localities, and otherwise are considered parts of 'Greater Pollok' (a ward of Glasgow City Council), along with Nitshill, South Nitshill, Parkhouse and Darnley further south which share the same G53 postcode;Pollok.Priesthill.Nitshill.The Bundy.Gowanbank.Silverburn.Schools, Memories, and Pubs, Alex and Bob's Blue Sky Scotland, 21 January 2014 Househillwood is next to the district's central amenities and bus terminus.

The slum clearance programme disrupted the networks of the old communities and the extended family. There were few shops (a central shopping centre was not added for three decades), no pubs, cinemas or leisure facilities. Even schools, something which eventually were well provisioned, were not built until some years after the main wave of housing, with pupils being transported to facilitates elsewhere at considerable cost and disruption.Housing Estates, Glasgow (Schools), Hansard, 18 April 1950 People lived far away from their places of work and there were very few employment opportunities locally. Renovated tenements (and one block awaiting work) in central Pollok, 2013 The post-war tenement buildings were of poor quality and suffered from damp, condensation and lack of soundproofing. Glasgow Corporation (later Glasgow District Council) could not maintain the buildings in the face of budgetary cuts imposed by central Government. Local manufacturing jobs were outsourced to overseas countries and unemployment rates grew to unprecedented levels. Those who were able to left the area, the remaining population enduring poverty, lack of opportunities, ill-health and lower life expectancy. In recent years there has been a sustained effort to improve the area. Most of the post-war tenement housing has been demolished or refurbished, and new private housing has also been built among the individual houses, which lasted more successfully than the multi-floor blocks.Pollok, 1950, Virtual Mitchell To the east of the residential area, Pollok House is a Georgian building constructed in 1752 with many fine paintings, and Pollok Country Park was chosen to house the \\"Burrell Collection\\" in a modern contemporary and clean air green space. It is the largest park in Glasgow. Education St Paul's High School (2017) Pollok has one secondary school: St Paul's High School, recognised as one of the 'schools of ambition' in Scotland. It was built on the site of another former school, Craigbank Secondary, which had lain empty for some years,Glasgow, 36 Damshot Road, St Paul's Rc High School, Canmore and replaced the area's previous Catholic school, St Robert Bellarmine Secondary which was sited where the southern sector of Silverburn now stands.Glasgow leads first wave of closures, TES (magazine), 5 April 1996Bellarmine celebration, 7 October 2000 However, St Paul's associated primary schools are in neighbourhoods to the south of Pollok proper,Learning Community, St Paul's High School, Glasgow whereas the Pollok-based primaries are part of the 'learning community' of Lourdes Secondary School in Cardonald.Primary Schools, Lourdes Secondary School The nondenominational Rosshall Academy (completed in 2002) serves a large catchment area including much of Pollok, but replaced Penilee Secondary and Crookston Castle Secondary so was built on a site between its predecessors which falls outwith Pollok across the White Cart. In 2009 the area lost a local primary school, Bonnyholm Primary, which was merged with other schools to create Crookston Castle Primary School. It was officially opened in August 2007 on the grounds of the former Crookston Castle Secondary, close to the castle. The former Cardonald College, now a campus of the merged Glasgow Clyde College, is near to Pollok between Cardonald and Mosspark. Shopping Entrance to Silverburn Centre Pollok is home to the Silverburn Centre which opened in October 2007, replacing the old Pollok Shopping Centre dating from the late 1970sModern Times: 1950s to The Present Day: Neighbourhoods: Pollok, 1979), The Glasgow Story which itself was previously tenement housing built in the late 1940s which survived barely 30 years before being torn down. The largest of its kind in Scotland, Silverburn has brought hundreds of jobs to the area. Key stores include a 24-hour Tesco Extra adjoining the centre. This was the largest store in Scotland when it opened in July 2006. Other anchor stores are M&S;, Debenhams and Next. Altogether, the centre houses 95 shopping units and 14 restaurants and caf√©s.

In 1992, he formed the progressive rock band Spock's Beard with his brother Alan and released an album which was moderately successful. In 1999, he joined former Dream Theater co-founder Mike Portnoy, Flower Kings' Roine Stolt and Marillion's Pete Trewavas to form the super- group Transatlantic. In 2002, Neal Morse became a born again Christian, left Spock's Beard and began a Christian rock solo career, releasing many progressive rock concept albums about his new religious faith. In the meantime, he continued to play with Transatlantic and formed three new bands with Portnoy, Yellow Matter Custard, Flying Colors and The Neal Morse Band. Biography =Band career= Morse grew up in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles as one of four children. His father was a choral director. Morse started to play the piano at the age of five and started to learn to play the guitar at the age of nine. During his twenties he wrote two musicals (Hit Man and Homeland), did some session jobs, tried to get a deal as a singer- songwriter in Los Angeles, and recorded a few country and western demos with his brother Richard. After about ten years, having played in small Californian clubs with various groups including Burlesque, Morse founded Spock's Beard together with his brother Alan, to give voice to his great passion for Progressive Rock. Their first album, The Light (1995), was moderately successful. Despite having released the first two Spock's Beard albums to good critical acclaim, Morse found himself struggling economically. His brother Richard advised him to go to Germany to play hit songs as a one-man band in pubs, accompanying himself with piano or guitar, to generate income. Morse then began periodic travel between California and Germany, where from time to time he remained for several weeks to work as a pub musician. During his periods in California, Morse continued to alternate work on new compositions for Spock's Beard, and live performance with them. At that time Morse was also part of the Eric Burdon band, touring with them, too. The popularity of Spock's Beard's continued to grow and they would soon become one of a number of successful progressive rock bands during the late nineties (along with Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, and The Flower Kings). While with Spock's Beard, Morse released two solo albums of more conventional straightforward rock music. In 1999, he joined former Dream Theater co-founder Mike Portnoy, Flower Kings' Roine Stolt and Marillion's Pete Trewavas to form the supergroup Transatlantic. The band has released four studio albums (SMPT:e, Bridge Across Forever, The Whirlwind and Kaleidoscope) plus live albums from the tours behind each studio disc: Live in America, Live in Europe, Whirld Tour 2010: Live in London, More Never Is Enough, and KaLIVEoscope. In concert, the group has included Daniel Gildenl√∂w of Pain of Salvation, and occasionally Ted Leonard, Morse's eventual replacement in Spock's Beard. Morse recording on a classical guitar In 2003, Morse, Mike Portnoy, Paul Gilbert and Matt Bissonette formed Yellow Matter Custard as a Beatles tribute supergroup. They took the name from a lyric in The Beatles song \\"I Am the Walrus\\": 'Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye...' On March 26, 2012, Morse released the first album of the newly formed band Flying Colors (Mike Portnoy on drums and vocals, Dave LaRue on bass, Neal Morse on keyboards and vocals, Casey McPherson on lead vocals, and guitar, and Steve Morse on lead guitar). In 2014, he gave life to another group, The Neal Morse Band (with Mike Portnoy, Randy George, Eric Gillette and Bill Hubauer), that released its first studio album The Grand Experiment in 2015. The group's second outing, The Similitude of a Dream, was released on November 11, 2016, and the sequel to that album, The Great Adventure, was released on January 25, 2019. = Solo career = Morse became a born again Christian in 2002. He left both Spock's Beard and Transatlantic immediately following the release of the Spock's Beard album Snow, in response to a calling to make his personal faith more prominent in his recorded output. He felt this would not be possible or appropriate in a band context. The period leading to this decision is described on the solo album Testimony (2003), an epic, introspective composition which features Kerry Livgren of Kansas and Mike Portnoy. One part of his conversion to Christianity, omitted from Testimony but described in full on Testimony Live and later in the song Jayda on Testimony 2, was that his daughter Jayda had been diagnosed as having a hole in her heart that required open-heart surgery. However, before Jayda received surgery, the hole disappeared following a church service in which Morse's wife and others prayed for God's healing.Neal Morse's \\"Testimony Live\\" DVD In 2004, Morse wrote and recorded a new concept album featuring Portnoy and Randy George (on bass guitar). Guitar virtuoso Phil Keaggy made a guest appearance on guitar and vocals. The album, titled One, is about man's relationship with God from his Christian perspective and was released on November 2, 2004. In 2005, Morse released two non-prog Christian albums. In January, Morse recorded Lead Me Lord with the Christian Gospel Temple Choir, his children, and his friends. Morse wrote about half of the tracks. This was released in February and is available for a donation. In July, Morse released God Won't Give Up, which was written around the Snow period. This is a pop album similar to It's Not Too Late, but with Christian lyrics. Morse in 2007 In the summer of 2005, a member of his church approached Morse to tell him that he should make an album based on the tabernacle and that he should keep it a secret. Morse nonetheless mentioned that he was working on a secret project before he had written a note or even committed himself to do the project. Mentioning it during a radio interview created enough buzz to convince him to make the album. There was a contest on his message board to guess the participants, theme, and meaning of the album based on a series of clues. The secret project was finally revealed to be ? (also known as The Question Mark album, rumored to be influenced in title by The White Album) and is about the tabernacle in the wilderness and the tabernacle of the heart. The studio band is Neal, Mike Portnoy, and Randy George with guests Mark Leniger, Alan Morse, Roine Stolt, Steve Hackett, and Jordan Rudess. In 2006, Morse issued Cover to Cover, a collection of cover versions by Mike Portnoy, Randy George and him, recorded during the production of ?, One and Testimony, proving that despite the new focus of his solo career Morse wasn't averse to tackling songs with non-religious themes. In early 2007, Morse released Sola Scriptura, a concept album detailing the life and struggles of the German theologian Martin Luther, and corruption within the medieval Church. Portnoy and George once again teamed with Morse and were joined by Paul Gilbert (of Racer X and Mr. Big) who contributed a few solo parts. Immediately following Sola Scriptura, Morse released the acoustic folk album \\"Songs from the Highway\\". The studio album Lifeline was released on September 30, 2008. Morse was once again joined by Portnoy and George, just four months after the release of the Sola Scriptura live DVD. A live album, So Many Roads, recorded with his European band, was released on June 30, 2009. Testimony 2, a sequel and expansion of the autobiographical story from the first Testimony album, was released May 23, 2011. As had become Morse's pattern, he followed that album with a tour and live DVD. Momentum was released on September 11, 2012, an album that, in structure, featured several shorter songs and one epic. In recent years, Morse has recorded two more cover albums with George and Portnoy (Cover 2 Cover in 2012 and Cov3r to Cov3r in 2020), a guest-heavy prog rock musical retelling the life and Passion of Christ (Jesus Christ the Exorcist, released in 2019), and a biographical album in the vein of Sola Scriptura based on the conversion and writings of Paul the Apostle (Sola Gratia, released in 2020). During his early solo years, Morse focused most of his touring in Europe and had a band made largely of European musicians. The incarnation that toured in Europe for Sola Scriptura, for example, included Collin Leijenaar (drums, music director), Paul Bielatowicz (guitars), Elisa Krijgsman (guitars), Wilco van Esschoten (bass guitar), Jessica Koomen (vocals, keyboards, percussion) and Henk Doest (keyboards). For Testimony 2, Morse reunited members from the band that toured the initial Testimony album, including Portnoy, George, Rick Altizer and others. He then held a contest to assemble a full-time band, which eventually toured behind Momentum. This new band consisted of Mike Portnoy (drums), Randy George (bass), Eric Gillette (guitars, keyboards) and Bill Hubauer (keyboards). Guitarist Adson Sodr√© was in the band until visa issues forced his departure. =Guest appearances= Morse (left) performing in the Netherlands, 2007 In 1997 he became a member of Eric Burdon's I band. They also released the concert film Live at the Coachhouse. In 2000, Morse provided vocals for the song \\"The First Man on Earth\\" on The Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, one of Arjen Anthony Lucassen's Ayreon albums. Neal Morse tracks have also appeared on the CPR Volume 1 (2004), CPR Volume 2, and The Tsunami Projekt anthologies. Morse also participated in recording the ProgAID single \\"All Around the World\\". The profits for both The Tsunami Projekt and the ProgAID single were donated for victims' relief from the 2004 Asian tsunami. Morse has been a guest musician on several 2005 albums, including Ajalon's Threshold of Eternity, Roine Stolt's Wallstreet Voodoo, Salem Hill's Mimi's Magic Moment, and Mark Leniger's Walk on Water. Morse was one of several musical guests to appear on Dream Theater's 2007 album Systematic Chaos, on the song \\"Repentance\\".

He is regarded as one of the great Polish-language prose stylists of the 20th century. In 1938, he was awarded the Polish Academy of Literature's prestigious Golden Laurel award. Several of Schulz's works were lost in the Holocaust, including short stories from the early 1940s and his final, unfinished novel The Messiah. Schulz was shot and killed by a German Nazi, a Gestapo officer, in 1942 while walking back home toward Drohobycz Ghetto with a loaf of bread. Biography Schulz was born in Drohobych, Austrian Galicia, historically part of the Kingdom of Poland before the three partitions, and today part of Ukraine. After World War One, Drohobycz became part of the Lw√≥w Voivodeship. Bruno Schulz was the son of cloth merchant Jakub Schulz and Henrietta n√©e Kuhmerker. At a very early age, he developed an interest in the arts. He attended W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço Middle School in Drohobych from 1902 to 1910, graduating with honours. Then he studied architecture at Lviv Polytechnic. His studies were interrupted by illness in 1911 but he resumed them in 1913 after two years of convalescence. In 1917 he briefly studied architecture in Vienna. At the end of World War I, when he was 26, Drohobycz became part of the newly reborn Polish Second Republic. Schulz returned to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço Middle School, teaching crafts and drawing from 1924 to 1941. His employment kept him in his hometown, although he disliked the teaching, apparently maintaining his job only because it was his sole source of income.Schulz, Bruno. The Street of Crocodiles. 1992, page 15. He also amused himself by telling his students stories during classes. Schulz developed his extraordinary imagination in a swarm of identities and nationalities: he was a Jew who thought and wrote in Polish, was fluent in German, immersed in Jewish culture, yet unfamiliar with the Yiddish language.\\"Who Owns Bruno Schulz?\\" , by Benjamin Paloff Boston Review (December 2004/January 2005). He drew inspiration from specific local and ethnic sources, looking inward and close to home rather than to the world at large. Avoiding travel, he preferred to remain in his provincial hometown, which over the course of his life belonged to or was fought over by successive states: the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1792‚Äì1919); the short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic (1919); the Second Polish Republic (1919‚Äì1939); the Soviet Ukraine from the invasion of Poland in 1939; and, during Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany after the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. His writings avoided explicit mention of world events of the time period. Schulz was discouraged by influential colleagues from publishing his first short stories. However, his aspirations were refreshed when several letters that he wrote to a friend, in which he gave highly original accounts of his solitary life and the details of the lives of his family and fellow citizens, were brought to the attention of the novelist Zofia Na≈Çkowska. She encouraged Schulz to have them published as short fiction. They were published as The Cinnamon Shops (Sklepy Cynamonowe) in 1934. In English-speaking countries, it is most often referred to as The Street of Crocodiles, a title derived from one of its chapters. The Cinnamon Shops was followed three years later by Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, (Sanatorium Pod KlepsydrƒÖ). The original publications were illustrated by Schulz; in later editions of his works, however, these illustrations were often left out or poorly reproduced. In 1936 he helped his fianc√©e, J√≥zefina Szeli≈Ñska, translate Franz Kafka's The Trial into Polish. In 1938, he was awarded the Polish Academy of Literature's prestigious Golden Laurel award. Commemorative plaque at the Drohobycz Ghetto house of Bruno Schulz with text in Ukrainian, Polish and Hebrew In 1939, after the Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in World War II, Drohobych was occupied by the Soviet Union. At the time, Schulz was known to have been working on a novel called The Messiah, but no trace of the manuscript survived his death. When the Germans launched their Operation Barbarossa against the Soviets in 1941, they forced Schulz into the newly formed Drohobycz Ghetto along with thousands of other dispossessed Jews, most of whom perished at the Belzec extermination camp before the end of 1942. A Nazi Gestapo officer, Felix Landau, however, admired Schulz's artwork and extended him protection in exchange for painting a mural in his Drohobych residence. Shortly after completing the work in 1942, Schulz was walking home through the \\"Aryan quarter\\" with a loaf of bread, when another Gestapo officer, Karl G√ºnther, shot him with a small pistol, killing him. This murder was in revenge for Landau's having murdered G√ºnther's own \\"personal Jew,\\" a dentist named L√∂w. Subsequently, Schulz's mural was painted over and forgotten ‚Äì only to be rediscovered in 2001. Writings Schulz's body of written work is small; The Street of Crocodiles, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass and a few other compositions that the author did not add to the first edition of his short story collection. A collection of Schulz's letters was published in Polish in 1975, entitled The Book of Letters, as well as a number of critical essays that Schulz wrote for various newspapers. Several of Schulz's works have been lost, including short stories from the early 1940s that the author had sent to be published in magazines, and his final, unfinished novel, The Messiah. Both books were featured in Penguin's series \\"Writers from the Other Europe\\" from the 1970s. Philip Roth was the general editor, and the series included authors such as Danilo Ki≈°, Tadeusz Borowski, Ji≈ô√≠ Weil, and Milan Kundera among others. An edition of Schulz's stories was published in 1957, leading to French, German, and later English translations which included The Street of Crocodiles, New York: Walker and Company, 1963 (translation by Celina Wieniewska of Sklepy Cynamonowe (Cinnamon Shops) as well as the Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass New York: Penguin, 1988, (translation by Celina Wieniewska of Sanatorium Pod KlepsydrƒÖ, with an introduction by John Updike) , and The Complete Fiction of Bruno Schulz. New York: Walker and Company, 1989. (Combination of the prior two collections.) Madeline G. Levine published a new translation of Schulz's Collected Stories in 2018, which won the Found in Translation Award in 2019. Adaptations Schulz's work has provided the basis for two films. Wojciech Has' The Hour- Glass Sanatorium (1973) draws from a dozen of his stories and recreates the dreamlike quality of his writings. A 21-minute, stop-motion, animated 1986 film, Street of Crocodiles, by the Quay Brothers, was inspired by Schulz's writing. In 1992, an experimental theatre piece based on The Street of Crocodiles was conceived and directed by Simon McBurney and produced by Theatre de Complicite in collaboration with the National Theatre in London. A highly complex interweaving of image, movement, text, puppetry, object manipulation, naturalistic and stylised performance underscored by music from Alfred Schnittke, Vladimir Martynov drew on Schulz's stories, his letters and biography. It received six Olivier Award nominations (1992) after its initial run, and was revived four times in London in the years that followed influencing a whole generation of British theatre makers. It subsequently played to audiences and festivals all over the world such as Quebec (Prix du Festival 1994), Moscow, Munich (teatre der Welt 1994), Villnius and many other countries. It was last revived in 1998 when it played in New York (Lincoln Center Festival) and other cities in the United States, Tokyo and Australia before returning the London to play an 8-week sell out season at the Queens Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. It has been published by Methuen, a UK publishing house, in a collection of plays by Complicite. In 2006, as part of a site-specific series in an historic Minneapolis office building, Skewed Visions created the multimedia performance/installation The Hidden Room. Combining aspects of Schulz's life with his writings and drawings, the piece depicted the complex stories of his life through movement, imagery and highly stylized manipulation of objects and puppets. In 2007, physical theatre company Double Edge Theatre premiered a piece called Republic of Dreams, based on the life and works of Bruno Schulz. In 2008, a play based on Cinnamon Shops, directed by Frank Soehnle and performed by the Puppet Theater from Bia≈Çystok, was performed at the Jewish Culture Festival in Krak√≥w. A performance based on the writings and art of Bruno Schulz, called \\"From A Dream to A Dream\\", was created collaboratively by Hand2Mouth Theatre (Portland, Oregon) and Teatr Stacja Szamocin (Szamocin, Poland) under the direction of Luba Zarembinska between 2006‚Äì2008. The production premiered in Portland in 2008. Literary references and biography Cynthia Ozick's 1987 novel, The Messiah of Stockholm, makes reference to Schulz's work. The story is of a Swedish man who's convinced that he's the son of Schulz, and comes into possession of what he believes to be a manuscript of Schulz's final project, The Messiah. Schulz's character appears again in Israeli novelist David Grossman's 1989 novel See Under: Love. In a chapter entitled \\"Bruno,\\" the narrator imagines Schulz embarking on a phantasmagoric sea voyage rather than remaining in Drohobych to be killed.David Grossman, See Under: Love. Trans. Betsy Rosenberg. New York: Washington Square Press, 1989. That entire novel has been described by Grossman as a tribute to Schulz.See Under: Love. David Grossman on Bruno Schulz http://www.pen.org/event/2009/05/04/see-under- love-david-grossman-bruno-schulz In the last chapter of Roberto Bola√±o's 1996 novel, Distant Star, the narrator, Arturo B, reads from a book titled The Complete Works of Bruno Schulz in a bar while waiting to confirm the identity of a Nazi-like character, Carlos Wieder, for a detective. When Wieder appears in the bar, the words of Schulz's stories '...had taken on a monstrous character that was almost intolerable' for Arturo B. Polish writer and critic Jerzy Ficowski spent sixty years researching and uncovering the writings and drawings of Schulz. His study, Regions of the Great Heresy, was published in an English translation in 2003, containing two additional chapters to the Polish edition; one on Schulz's lost work, Messiah, the other on the rediscovery of Schulz's murals.Jerzy Ficowski, Regions of the Great Heresy, translated and edited by Theodosia Robertson, W.W.Norton & Company, 2003 China Mi√©ville's 2009 novel The City & the City begins with an epigraph from John Curran Davis's translation of Schulz's The Cinnamon Shops: \\"Deep inside the town there open up, so to speak, double streets, doppelg√§nger streets, mendacious and delusive streets\\". In addition to directly alluding to the dual nature of the cities in Mi√©ville's novel, the epigraph also hints at the political implications of the book, since Schulz himself was murdered for appearing in the \\"wrong\\" quarter of the city. In 2010 Jonathan Safran Foer \\"wrote\\" his \\"Tree of Codes\\" by cutting into the pages of an English language edition of Schulz' \\"The Street of Crocodiles\\" thus creating a new text. In 2011, the Austrian Rock and Roll Band \\"Nebenjob\\" published the Song \\"Wer erschoss Bruno Schulz \\"who shot Bruno Schulz?\\"), a homage on the poet and accusation of the murderer, written by T.G. Huemer (see 'references' below). Schulz and The Street of Crocodiles are mentioned several times in 2005 novel The History of Love by Nicole Krauss, with a version of Schulz (having survived the Holocaust) playing a supporting role. Mural controversy In February 2001, Benjamin Geissler, a German documentary filmmaker, discovered the mural that Schulz had created for Landau. Polish conservation workers, who had begun the meticulous task of restoration, informed Yad Vashem, the Israeli holocaust memorial, of the findings. In May of that year representatives of Yad Vashem went to Drohobych to examine the mural. They removed five fragments of it and transported them to Jerusalem.Amiram Barkat, \\"Yad Vashem not displaying Bruno Schulz Holocaust art\\", Haaretz, 06/04/05. Last accessed January 2, 2011. International controversy ensued.\\"Bruno Schulz's Frescoes\\", by Mark Baker, M.B.B. Biskupski, John Connelly, Ronald E. Coons et al. The New York Review of Books (Volume 48, Number 19 ‚Ä¢ November 29, 2001)\\"All Things Considered\\", NPR (Monday, July 9, 2001) Yad Vashem said that parts of the mural were legally purchased, but the owner of the property said that no such agreement was made, and Yad Vashem did not obtain permission from the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture despite legal requirements.The New York Times. Artwork by Holocaust Victim Is Focus of Dispute. June 20, 2001 The fragments left in place by Yad Vashem have since been restored and, after touring Polish museums, are now part of the collection at the Bruno Schulz Museum in Drohobych. This gesture by Yad Vashem instigated public outrage in Poland and Ukraine, where Schulz is a beloved figure. The issue reached a settlement in 2008 when Israel recognized the works as \\"the property and cultural wealth\\" of Ukraine, and Ukraine's Drohobychyna Museum agreed to let Yad Vashem keep them as a long-term loan.Heller, Aron \\"Paintings of \\"Polish Kafka\\" revealed in Israel\\"; The Orange County Register, February 20, 2009 In February 2009, Yad Vashem opened its display of the murals to the public.

It is probably the best known traditional Korean musical instrument.Jan. 11, 2007,Korean Instruments Seoul Metropolitan Government It is related to other Asian instruments, including the Chinese guzheng, Japanese koto, Mongolian yatga, Vietnamese ƒë√†n tranh, Sundanese kacapi and Kazakh jetigen. When played, the sound varies between traditional Eurasian stringed instruments and the Appalachian banjo.  History  A musician playing a 12-string sanjo gayageum The gayageum is descended from an ancient Chinese zither known as the guzheng. = Pungryu gayageum (beopgeum, jeongak gayageum) = According to the Samguksagi (1145), a history of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, the gayageum was developed around the sixth century in the Gaya confederacy by King Gasil (also known as Haji of Daegaya) after he observed an old Chinese instrument. He ordered a musician named Wu Ruk to compose music that could be played on the instrument. The original name was gayago(or gayatgo) and later gayageum. The gayageum was then further improved by Wu Ruk during the reign of Jinheung in the Shilla dynasty. The ancient gayageum of King Gasil was called by several names, including beopgeum (law-zither, Î≤ïÍ∏à), pungnyu (elegance, ÌíçÎ•ò), or jeong-ak (right music, Ï†ïÏïÖ) gayageum. It is normally associated with accompaniment for court music, chamber music, and lyric songs. This type of gayageum has a wider spacing between the strings and plays slower-tempo music such as Yeongsan hoesang and Mit-doduri. = Sanjo gayageum = The sanjo gayageum is believed to have evolved in the 19th century with the emergence of sanjo music, which literally means \\"scattered melodies\\", a musical form that involves fast tempos and some improvisation. The sanjo gayageum version of the instrument has closer string spacing and a shorter length to let musicians play the faster passages required for sanjo.Ïú†ÏûêÏ∞® Choi (2005). Kayagum. Retrieved July 29, 2005. *Korean Court-Music Promotion Corporation (2001). Welcome to The Koong Sung Koogak Sa, the Korean Court- Music Promotion Corporation. Retrieved July 30, 2005. The sanjo gayageum is now the most widespread form of gayageum.(KCMPC 2001). All traditional gayageum use silk strings, though since the late 20th century, some musicians use nylon. = Modern gayageum = Modern versions of the gayageum with more strings often use nylon-wrapped steel strings, similar to those used for the Chinese guzheng. Brass strings have also been introduced to produce a louder sound, which is preferred for accompanying dance.Park, Yong-Jae (2004). KOSEF NEWSLETTER. Golden Retriever 1000. To play modern music, gayageum with a greater number of strings have been developed, increasing the instrument's range. Gayageum are available with 13, 17, 18, 21, 22, or 25 strings, though instruments with more strings are available custom-made.photo of gayageum with 25 strings The 21-string gayageum is normally found in North Korea. Playing method Concert Kwak SooEun and ensemble playing the gayageum The gayageum is traditionally played when sitting on the floor with crossed legs, the head of the instrument resting on the right knee and the tail resting on the floor. When played whilst seated on a chair or stool, the tail end is usually placed on a special fold-out stand, similar to a camp-stool, or another chair/stool. For modern gayageum, they may be placed on a special stand with the player seated on a chair behind the instrument. The North Koreans usually play whilst seated on a chair, but they do not use a stand of the tail end. Instead, the gayageum has detachable legs that are fixed into the end to raise the tail high enough. The gayageum is played with both right and left hands. The right hand plucks and flicks the strings close to the bridge of the gayageum, whilst the left hand pushes the strings on the left side of the bridges to raise the pitch and adds vibrato and other ornamentation. Tunings and modes The gayageum can be tuned to a variety of pitches depending on use, though no standard exists as to what exact pitches they should be tuned. They include: * ‚ô≠E, F, ‚ô≠A, ‚ô≠B, ‚ô≠E, F, ‚ô≠A, ‚ô≠B, c, ‚ô≠e, f, ‚ô≠a * ‚ô≠E, F, ‚ô≠A, ‚ô≠B, ‚ô≠E, ‚ô≠E, ‚ô≠A, ‚ô≠B, ‚ô≠d, ‚ô≠e, f, ‚ô≠a * ‚ô≠E, ‚ô≠A, ‚ô≠B, ‚ô≠E, F, ‚ô≠A, ‚ô≠B, c, ‚ô≠e, f, ‚ô≠a, ‚ô≠b * G, C, D, G, A, C, D, E, G, A, c, d When noted in staff notation, however, the pitch series is usually transposed as the following, regardless of the actual pitches tuned on the strings: * D, G, A, D, E, G, A, B, d, e, g, a This is to avoid switching between the bass and treble clefs to make reading the music easier. Traditionally, three modes are used: *ÁæΩË™ø (Ïö∞Ï°∞): G key *Âπ≥Ë™ø (ÌèâÏ°∞): C key *ÁïåÈù¢Ë™ø (Í≥ÑÎ©¥Ï°∞): ‚ô≠B key Construction The beobgeum gayageum is 160 cm long by 30 cm wide by 10 cm deep. Its body is made of a single piece of paulownia wood. The resonator chamber is hollowed out of the piece of paulownia. The sanjo gayageum is about 142 cm long by 23 cm wide by 10 cm deep. The soundboard is made of paulownia, but the sides and back are of a harder wood such as chestnut or walnut. On the soundboard, anjok (movable bridges) support the strings. These bridges move to adjust the tuning and intonation. The strings enter the top of the body from tolgwae (string pegs) beneath. At the other end, the strings wind around loops at the end of thick cords, which pass over the nut then looped through holes at the bottom of the instrument and secured, and then the cords are all tied in a decorative coil. The left hand presses the strings to raise the pitch, and finger movements perform various movements such as shaking, bending, and vibrating the strings. The right hand plucks or strums the strings. The gayageum's tone is soft, delicate, and subtle. Legend says the instrument was first made by King Gasil in the Kaya Kingdom around the sixth century, and was further developed by Ureuk in the time of King of Jinhung in the Silla dynasty. According to some evidence, however, it dates to a much earlier time than the Silla dynasty. Recent archaeological excavations in the Kwangsan areas in Jeolla-namdo Province revealed fragments of a gayageum from around the first century BCE. The gayageum is employed in different types of music, leading to variations of the instrument, including the following: *Pungryu gayageum is the original form, with more widely spaced strings for slower-tempo works. *Sanjo gayageum is a smaller, modern version with more closely spaced strings to accommodate rapid playing. *Modern gayageum instruments broaden the body and add more strings to increase the pitch range to accommodate contemporary music.  Music  = Sanjo and folk = The six or more schools of the gayageum sanjo include Seong Geum Yeon, Kim Juk Pa, Kim Yoon Deok, Kang Tae Hong, Kim Byeong Ho, and Choi Ok Sam schools. = Contemporary = Contemporary music composers have been creating modern music for the gayageum. Hwang Byung Ki composed \\"Forest\\" as a first modern gayageum piece, Sungcheon Lee created 21-string gayageum and new pieces. Beomhoon Park composed the gayageum concerto \\"New Sanjo\\" (ÏÉàÏÇ∞Ï°∞) for 25-string gayageum, and following generation's composers and western musicians have been composing modern music for it.

The skirmish, which was fought near the Lost River along the California‚ÄìOregon border, was the result of an attempt by the U.S. 1st Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army to force a band of the Modoc tribe to relocate back to the Klamath Reservation, which they had left in objection of its conditions. In the subsequent war, Captain Jack of the Modoc and 53 warriors held off more than 1000 U.S. soldiers for 7 months in the area of the present-day Lava Beds National Monument. Part of this was named Captain Jack's Stronghold in his honor. Description In the 1860s, the Modoc had been removed from their traditional home near the Lost River in California to the newly established Klamath Reservation in Oregon. The more numerous Klamath were traditional enemies, and the peoples had conflicts on the reservation. In 1872, Kintpuash (Captain Jack) led his band of about 100 Modoc back to their traditional home on Lost River. White settlers had moved into the area during their absence and complained to the government about the returning Modoc, asking that the Indians be forced back to the reservation. On November 27, Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent T. B. Odeneal requested Major John Green, commanding officer at Fort Klamath, to furnish sufficient troops to compel Captain Jack to return to the reservation. On November 28, Captain James Jackson, commanding 40 troops, left Fort Klamath for Captain Jack's camp. Reinforced by citizens from Linkville (now Klamath Falls, Oregon), the troops reached Jack's camp on the Lost River about a mile above Emigrant Crossing (now Stone Bridge, Oregon) on November 29. Wishing to avoid conflict, Captain Jack agreed to go to the reservation. The situation became tense when Captain Jackson demanded he and his warriors disarm. Captain Jack had never fought the army, and was alarmed at this command, but finally agreed to put down his weapons. The rest of the Modoc were following his lead, when warrior Scarfaced Charley and an unidentified army sergeant reportedly got into a verbal argument, pulled their revolvers, and shot at each other, both missing. The Modoc scrambled to regain their weapons, and fought a short battle before fleeing toward the border with California. After driving the Modoc from camp, Captain Jackson ordered his troops to retreat to await reinforcements. The casualties in this short battle included one U.S. soldier killed and seven wounded, and two Modoc killed and three wounded. On their way to the Lava Beds south of Tule Lake, a small band of Modoc under the leadership of Hooker Jim killed 18 settlers on the afternoon of November 29 and morning of November 30. This attack added to calls for the US Army troops to be reinforced and the Modoc suppressed.

It is situated in the historical region of Western Moldavia. FƒÉlticeni is the second largest urban settlement in the county, with a population of 24,619 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census. It was declared a municipality in 1995, along with two other cities in Suceava County: RƒÉdƒÉu»õi and C√¢mpulung Moldovenesc. FƒÉlticeni covers an area of 28,76 km¬≤, of which 25% are orchards and lakes, and it administers two villages: »òoldƒÉne»ôti and »öarna Mare. It was the capital of former Baia County (1929‚Äì1950). The city is known for the high number of Romanian writers, artists, and scientists who were born, lived, studied, or have created here. Geography FƒÉlticeni is located in the southern part of Suceava County, 25 km away from Suceava, the capital of the county. The European route E85 crosses the city. FƒÉlticeni is connected to the Romanian national railway system, through Dolhasca train station (24 km away). The city of Roman is 80 km south, on E85 road. History The earliest written mention of the village Folticeni is from March 1490, and the second from March 1554, when Moldavian Prince Alexandru LƒÉpu≈üneanu awarded the estate and the village bearing the aforesaid name to Moldovi»õa Monastery. FƒÉlticeni was first mentioned as an urban settlement in August 1780 as T√¢rgul »òoldƒÉne»ôti (»òoldƒÉne»ôti Market), after the name of a local boyar's estate, in a document issued by the chancellery of Prince Constantin Moruzi. In March 1826, an edict issued by Prince Ioan Sturdza changed the name of the town to FƒÉlticeni. FƒÉlticeni was bombed by the Bolsheviks during World War I. Between 1929-1950 FƒÉlticeni was the capital of former Baia County. From 1950 to present the city is part of Suceava County. In the year 1921 the Faltishan (Yiddish for FƒÉlticeni) Hasidic dynasty was founded in FƒÉlticeni, by Rabbi Eluzar Twersky, a scion of the Skver Hasidic sect, and part of the prestigious royal Hasidic Twersky family. Today they are Jewish communities in Brooklyn, New York carrying on the name Faltishan, led by Rabbi Twersky's descendants. Demographics FƒÉlticeni reached its peak population in 1992, when almost 33,000 people were living within the city limits. As of 2016, the town of FƒÉlticeni was the third largest urban settlement in Suceava County, after the county capital, Suceava, and the town of RƒÉdƒÉu»õi. According to the 2011 census data, 24,619 inhabitants lived in FƒÉlticeni, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, when the city had a population of 29,787 inhabitants. In 2011, of the city total population, 98.15% were ethnic Romanians, 0.76% Roma, 0.75% Russians (including Lipovans), 0.07% Hungarians, 0.04% Germans (Regat Germans), 0.02% Ukrainians, and 0.01% Poles.

It was also known as The Dalton Brothers because four of its members were brothers. The gang specialized in bank and train robberies. During an attempted double bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1892, two of the brothers and two other gang members were killed; Emmett survived and was captured, tried, and convicted. He was paroled after serving 14 years in prison. Bob, Gratton \\"Grat,\\" and Emmett had first worked as lawmen for the federal court at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and then for the Osage Nation. They started stealing horses to make more money and then fled the area. They decided to form a gang, and started robbing banks, stagecoaches, and trains. While their middle brother \\"Bill\\" Dalton never joined any heists, he served as their spy and informant. Due to the sensationalism that surrounded the Dalton Gang's exploits, they were accused of several different robberies all over the country, but operated chiefly in Kansas and Oklahoma Territory. Numerous myths were published about the gang. After Bob and Grat were killed at Coffeyville, Bill Dalton formed another gang with Bill Doolin. It was known as the Wild Bunch, or the Dalton-Doolin Gang.  Beginnings  Their father was Lewis Dalton from Jackson County, Missouri and Kentucky. He was a saloon keeper in Kansas City, Missouri, when he married Adeline Lee Younger. Through her brother, she was an aunt of Cole and Jim Younger, who also became outlaws. The Dalton children were: * Charles Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Dalton (1852‚Äì1936) * Henry Coleman \\"Cole\\" Dalton (1853‚Äì1920) * Littleton \\"Lit\\" Lee Dalton (1857‚Äì1942) * Franklin \\"Frank\\" Dalton (1859‚Äì1887) * Gratton Hanley \\"Grat\\" Dalton (1861‚Äì1892) * William Marion \\"Bill\\" Dalton (1863‚Äì1894) * Eva May Dalton (1867‚Äì1939) * Robert Rennick \\"Bob\\" Dalton (1869‚Äì1892) * Emmett Dalton (1871‚Äì1937) * Leona Randolph Dalton (1875‚Äì1964) * Nancy May Dalton (1876‚Äì1901) * Simon Noel \\"Si\\" Dalton (1878‚Äì1928) The brothers who were members of the Dalton Gang were: Bob, Grat, Emmett, and Bill. Their father Lewis Dalton spent much of his time unsuccessfully gambling on his own race horses. As early as 1870, he would travel to California to enter in the circuits, sometimes being gone for months at a time. Starting with his oldest, he would eventually bring all his sons along with him. In 1877, while their father was running horses in Visalia, California, the oldest sons were offered steady work but refused. After returning home from the races, Ben, Lit, and Frank, decided to take up the offer and traveled back to California to work as muleskinners. Cole and Grat followed in 1880. Grat quickly made a reputation as a bar fighter in saloons up and down the San Joaquin Valley. That same year Frank was offered a job in the Indian Territory, now the state of Oklahoma, as a Deputy U.S. Marshal based at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and decided to take it. The job would result in his being closer to home. Going in the opposite direction, Bill joined his brothers in California in 1884. He married and started a family, and leased a ranch in San Luis Obispo County. The father Lewis Dalton eventually gambled away the family home in Belton, Missouri. In 1890 their mother Adeline acquired a piece of land near Kingfisher, when the Oklahoma Territory was opened for white settlement. Their father Lewis died shortly after, before any of his sons became outlaws. Lawmen Frank Dalton On Nov 27, 1887, Frank Dalton and another deputy marshal, Jim Cole, went across the river from Fort Smith to arrest three whiskey bootleggers. As they approached the camp the bootleggers began to fire on them. Frank shot and killed two, but his gun jammed and he was killed by the remaining bootlegger. His deputy abandoned him after being wounded. Frank is buried in Coffeyville, Kansas. After Frank's death, brothers Grat and Bob took over his job as Deputy U.S. Marshal at Fort Smith, Arkansas. Bob soon hired Emmett under him to guard prisoners. The trouble started when Bob killed a man in the line of duty, which he claimed was in self defense. He became restless and began to drink heavily. Afterwards Bob was given the job of organizing a police force in the Osage Nation, and took Emmett along as a deputy. Grat, meanwhile, stayed at Fort Smith. Emmett and Bob kept good reputations in the Osage Nation until July 1890, when they began stealing horses. Eventually, stockmen organized a posse to capture them, and forced Bob and Emmett to flee. They hid out on the bluffs of the Canadian River about seventy miles southwest of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, there they sent to Grat for help. Grat tried to send them food, horses, and ammunition but was caught and thrown in jail at Fort Smith, where he had formerly placed prisoners. After two weeks, Grat was released in the hopes he would lead the law to his brothers. Bob and Emmett, however, were able to take a train to California where they would begin to work at their brother Bill's ranch near San Miguel, San Luis Obispo County, California. Discredited as lawmen, the Daltons would soon form their gang. Outlaws Grat Dalton returned to California to meet Emmett and Bob at Bill's ranch in January 1891. They worked there for about a month while they played poker and got in bar fights at saloons throughout San Luis Obispo County. Here they spent most of the money they had made from horse stealing. Around this time Bob Dalton began making plans to rob a train with the help of Emmett and Grat. Their brothers Cole, Lit, and Bill unsuccessfully tried to dissuade them. Emmett was initially against the idea, but agreed to follow Bob. On the night of February 6, 1891, a Southern Pacific Railroad passenger train was held up by two masked men who carried only 44-calibre revolvers, near the town of Alila (present day Earlimart, California). No money was successfully taken, but during the crossfire with the outlaws the fireman had accidentally been killed by the expressman. The outlaws had worn masks during the Alila robbery, concealing their identities. It was asserted many years later by Lit Dalton, however, that Bob and Emmett had told him many times that they robbed the train. Grat was unable to join the heist after spending all his money on drinking and gambling in Tulare, California, therefore unable to secure a horse. Sheriff Eugene Kay of Tulare County, California and his posse tracked the outlaws to a ranch in San Luis Obispo County, near Cholame. They decided to see if they could spend the night at the ranch and continue their search in the morning. The ranch was owned by Bill Dalton. Early the next morning, as Sheriff Kay prepared to leave, he found the remnants of a saddle in a haystack near Bill‚Äôs barn. The saddle was missing a leather strap, the same strap that Kay had found at the scene of the hold up. Unknown to Kay, Bill had hid Bob and Emmett in his barn and they had barely escaped discovery. Sheriff Kay then spent the day in Paso Robles and learned what he could about Bill. He discovered that Bill's brothers had a reputation as horse thieves in Oklahoma, and had spent the past few months working at Bill‚Äôs ranch. He then received a telegram from Tulare and learned that Bob, Emmett and Grat had spent the past few days heavily drinking, gambling and following the Southern Pacific pay car as it made its monthly journey down the San Joaquin Valley. Sheriff Kay was met in Paso Robles by Southern Pacific Railway detective Will Smith and San Luis Obispo County Sheriff O‚ÄôNeal, where he told them what he had learned. Unbenounced to Kay, Smith and O'Neal then made their own trip to Bill Dalton‚Äôs ranch later that same day, expecting to surprise and arrest Bill, Bob, and Emmett. Sheriff Kay had been preparing his own posse to arrest the Daltons at Bill‚Äôs ranch, but after learning that Smith and O‚ÄôNeal had already left, decided it was useless and waited for Smith to return with the Daltons. When Smith and O‚ÄôNeal arrived at Bill‚Äôs, Bob and Emmett hid in a closet through a trapdoor that Bill had built in the attic. Bill invited the lawmen in but argued with Smith over his brother's guilt. He became angry with Smith but was calmed down by O‚ÄôNeal and reluctantly allowed the lawmen to stay the night. They left the next morning empty handed and Kay was furious with Smith. Photo of Robert \\"Bob\\" Dalton c. 1889 On March 17, 1891, the Tulare County Grand Jury indicted brothers Bob, Emmett, Grat, and Bill Dalton for the Alila robbery. A few days later Grat and Bill were arrested and placed in the Tulare County jail. A $3000 bounty was placed for the capture of Bob and Emmett. Bill however had already helped them escape California before he was arrested, and Bob and Emmett were on their way back to Oklahoma territory. Bill was soon able to secure bondsmen and was released. He quickly hired attorneys to defend Grat. While Grat sat in jail in Visalia, California, Bob and Emmett began making their way to Oklahoma. They borrowed money and supplies from their brothers, Cole and Lit, and made their way east across the Mojave Desert. After their horses were discovered at Ludlow, California, Sheriff Kay decided to pursue them with his deputy, Jim Ford. He discovered that the brothers had actually made their way to Utah to throw him off, and tracked them to the town of Ogden, Utah. After some close encounters, Bob and Emmett escaped capture by train. Sheriff Kay continued to track them throughout the Southwest for several months, even at one point entering Mexico, but with no success. Eventually they ended up at the Dalton home near Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The Daltons had many friends in Oklahoma willing to hide them and Sheriff Kay was forced to give up the chase in order to return to California for Grat's trial. After they realized they were no longer being pursued, Bob and Emmett robbed a train at Whorton, now Perry, Oklahoma, in May 1891. They then began to form what would be known as the Dalton Gang. Even though much of the evidence showed that Grat was in Fresno, California the night of the Alila robbery, including the testimony of several witnesses, the influence of the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad led him to receive an unfair trial. The lawyer the Daltons had hired for Grat was corrupt and it was not mentioned by the defense, nor the prosecution, that the fireman had been accidentally killed by the expressman. This was unknown to Grat, since the Dalton brothers had all assumed that Emmett had killed the fireman. While Grat awaited his sentence, a train robbery occurred near Ceres, California on September 3, 1891, but was unsuccessful with no money being taken. Sheriff Kay suspected Bill Dalton, and arrested him, as well a man joining Bill named Riley Dean. Kay found Bill and Dean at an abandoned overland stage station where they looked as if they were either planning a robbery, or to break Grat from jail. Both Bill and Dean established a clear alibi, but Bill was held in Tulare County Jail to await trial for his part in the Alila robbery. Dalton Mountain, Fresno County, California, Christmas Eve 2019, as viewed from the Wonder Valley Ranch Resort On September 21, Grat was brought into court to face sentencing, but this was instead postponed to October 6. On the night of September 27, Grat and two other men escaped from the County Jail in Visalia while Sheriff Kay was in San Francisco, California. Grat and the other two men had been slipped a saw from someone on the outside and were able to saw a hole in the bars. Bill had remained in his cell, and was found in the morning playing a popular song on the guitar that he set his own words to and titled, \\"You'll Never Miss My Brother Till He's Gone\\", and joked about how the boys had left him. Bill was acquitted and released on October 15. He then sold the lease to his ranch in San Luis Obispo County, moved his family to his wife's parents in Livingston, California, and left for Kingfisher, Oklahoma. After arresting the two other men who had escaped with Grat, Sheriff Kay learned that Grat was assisted by Riley Dean, and that they were both hiding on the summit of a steep mountain close to the Kings River, near Sanger, California. This would later be known as Dalton Mountain. On Christmas Eve, 1891, the posses of both Sheriff Kay of Tulare County, and Sheriff Hensley of Fresno County, ascended the mountain to Daltons camp. They ambushed the outlaws on their way back from a boar hunt. Riley Dean was captured, but Grat managed to escape, firing at the lawmen with his Winchester rifle, and stealing a horse from the nearby Elwood ranch. Grat then rode to a friends near Livingston, California, and stayed for several weeks before he escaped back to Oklahoma with the help of his brother Cole. Bob and Emmett had meanwhile been busy in Oklahoma forming their gang. After their unsuccessful career in California they decided they could do much better in their home country and, unlike their first attempts, they began carefully planning their robberies. With Bob as the leader they recruited mostly men who had grown up with them in Oklahoma. First recruited were George \\"Bitter Creek\\" Newcomb and \\"Blackfaced\\" Charlie Bryant, Bryant received his nickname because of a gunpowder burn on one cheek. This resulted in the first robbery at Whorton, May 1891, where the gang stole $1200. Joining afterwards were Bill Doolin, Dick Broadwell, Bill Powers, and Charley Pierce. The gang was also assisted by Bob's lover Eugenia Moore, known by her aliases \\"Tom King\\" and \\"Miss Mundays\\", who acted as their informant but was also a notorious horse thief and outlaw. Bill Dalton In August 1891, Bryant was spotted in Hennessey, Oklahoma, after leaving the gang's hideout to visit his mother. The locals who identified him notified a Deputy Marshal named Ed Short. He arrested Bryant and took him on a train to be committed to the jail at Wichita, Kansas, without a guard or notifying Marshal Grimes at Fort Smith. After the train left Hennessey and was approaching the stop at Waukomis, Oklahoma, Short noticed a group of mounted men that looked as if they were trying to beat the train, and feared it was the Dalton Gang coming to free Bryant. Short put the baggage man in charge of Bryant, giving him his revolver, while he went to the rear platform with his rifle. The baggageman carelessly stuck the revolver into a Pigeon-hole messagebox and went to work at the other end of the car. Bryant secured the revolver and ordered the baggageman to go back to work. He opened the door to the rear platform and, while Short had his attention to the mounted men, shot him in the back. Short then turned and they both shot each other to death. The second train robbery by the Dalton Gang in Oklahoma was at a small station called Lelietta on September 15, 1891, about four miles north of Wagoner, Oklahoma. Here they secured $19,000, which Bob spent mostly on women and gambling. Many members of the gang, including Emmett, complained that the $3500 each was not enough to meet their needs. Bill Doolin complained that Bob was not dividing the money fairly, and quit the gang, along with Newcomb and Pierce. Grat returned to Oklahoma in the spring of 1892. Some time later, the three dissatisfied members also returned and new plans began to formulate. Bill had returned to Oklahoma several months earlier, living at his mothers near Kingsfisher. Even though he did not participate in any of the hold ups with his brothers, he acted as their spy and advisor. On June 1, 1892, the gang robbed the Sante Fe train at Red Rock, Oklahoma, securing about $50,000. Here the Santa Fe had found out about the Daltons plans and attempted to set up a trap for the gang, filling the train with heavily armed officers. However, they made the mistake of leaving the train dark which made Bob suspicious, and the gang allowed the train to go by. They then robbed the next train a few minutes later. The $50,000 however came out to only $1800 after draft and securities had been thrown out. After splitting the money amongst themselves it was soon necessary to rob another train. The next robbery was on July 14, at Adair, Oklahoma, near the Arkansas border. At the station the gang took what they could find in the express and baggage rooms. They sat to wait for the next train on a bench on the platform, talking and smoking, with their Winchester rifles across their knees. When the train came in at 9:45 p.m., they backed a wagon up to the express car and unloaded all the contents. The eight armed guards on the train all happened to be at the back of the train when it pulled in. They fired at the bandits through the car windows and from behind the train. In the gun fight, 200 shots were fired. None of the Dalton gang was hit. Doctors W. L. Goff and Youngblood were sitting on the porch of the drug store near the depot. Both men were hit several times by stray shots; Dr Goff was fatally wounded. Also wounded were captains Kinney and LaFlore, but they recovered. The gang secured about $18,000. They were also accused of robbing a bank in El Reno, Oklahoma on July 28, however this was based on little evidence as no one identified any members of the gang. After the robbery at Adair, officials of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad offered a reward of $40,000 for anyone who could capture and convict the Dalton Gang, and a reward of $5,000 for the arrest of any of them. Coffeyville bank robbery Bob Dalton had ambitions. He would, he claimed, \\"beat anything Jesse James ever did--rob two banks at once, in broad daylight.\\" On October 5, 1892, the Dalton gang attempted this feat when they set out to rob the C.M. Condon & Company's Bank and the First National Bank on opposite sides of the street in Coffeyville, Kansas. Bob had planned the entire robbery. Emmett however was against the idea. He had gone to school at Robbins Corners near Coffeyville and knew several hundred people in town. He was afraid some of his friends would be hurt, but Bob assured him there wouldn't be any shooting and that it would all be over before anyone knew what happened. The plan was that Bob and Emmett were to rob the First National Bank while Grat, Broadwell, and Powers robbed the Condon Bank across the street. Emmett thought Grat would mess things up if he went alone with Powers and Broadwell, and thought they should trade places. This led to a heavy argument between Bob and Emmett and created bitterness between them on the way to the robbery. Bob had planned for the gang to tie their horses to a post behind the Condon Bank, where it was protected from the center of town by brick walls. They had not been to the town for several years however and the hitching post had since been removed during street work. Bob would not allow Emmett to check out town beforehand in fear that he would be recognized, so this was not factored into their plan. When they arrived Bob had to think quickly and decided instead to tie their horses in an alley across from the bank to the west, near the city jail, which offered them little protection. This is now known as Dalton Alley. On the morning of October 5, the gang emerged from the alley onto the plaza of Coffeyville. A storekeeper who was sweeping the sidewalk a few feet away noticed Bob, Emmett, and even Grat who was wearing a fake mustache, and ran inside his store. In close order the five crossed Walnut Street from the alley to the Condon Bank, holding Winchester rifles close along their legs. Grat, Broadwell, and Powers entered the Condon Bank and Emmett and Bob hurried across Union Street to the First National Bank. There was street work being done at the time and one of the workers noticed the men dog trotting across the alley with rifles, and began to yell, \\"The Daltons are robbing the bank!\\" Very soon half the businessmen around the plaza knew what was going on and the message quickly passed throughout the town. Grat entered the Condon Bank and pointed his Winchester at the cashier, ordering his hands up, while Powers and Broadwell took positions at the door. Grat went to the back office and ordered the manager into the front, he then handed the cashier a sack bag and ordered him to fill it with cash from the money drawer. Then, noticing the vault door was open, Grat ordered both of them into the vault where the safe with the gold was. When told to open the safe the manager lied, telling Grat it was a time lock and that it would not open for another ten minutes. Grat believed him and decided he would wait until it opened. He then ordered the bags of silver on the vault floor into his bag, containing $1000 and weighing about two hundred pounds. Meanwhile, Emmett and Bob had entered the First National Bank, covered the officers and two customers, and ordered the cashier, Thomas Aryes, to open the safe where there was gold and cash. They put the gold into the sack, forced Aryes in front of them as cover, and went out the front door. They had planned to meet up with Grat and cross the plaza to the alley where they could make their escape, but word of the robbery had spread through town. As they exited the door an American Express agent opened fire with his revolver. Bob and Emmett returned fire and left Aryes on the sidewalk. They turned around, and went through the back door, carrying both rifles and sack bags while taking two other bank employees as cover. Grat heard the revolver shots from the Express agent. He then decided the sack bag was too heavy to carry and ordered the silver taken out, then stashed what cash he could fit into his coat pockets. Two hardware stores in the town had meanwhile began passing out guns to the local citizens, who began firing through the windows at the Condon Bank. The three returned fire and held out, waiting for the time lock to open. Several citizens were wounded in the fighting. When Emmett and Bob went out the back door of the First National Bank, they were met by Lucius Baldwin who had been watching the door with his pistol. Bob ordered him to drop the gun and, when he failed to answer, shot him with his Winchester killing him. Bob and Emmett then made their way to the end of the back alley onto Eighth Street where they could hear the townspeople shooting at the Condon Bank. Outside of a drug store across from the First National, George Cubine was standing with his Winchester aimed at the front door of the bank, awaiting the exit of Bob and Emmett. Bob shot him in the head. Cubine's partner, Charles Brown, was standing unarmed next to him and went to pick up his winchester. As he lifted the rifle up, Bob shot and killed him. After being left on the sidewalk by Bob and Emmett, Thomas Aryes had run into one of the hardware stores and grabbed a rifle. He spotted Bob just as he had killed Brown and aimed his rifle at him from behind the store window. Bob saw Aryes from about two hundred feet away and quickly shot him in the head. Aryes was not killed, but he would remain paralyzed for life. As bullets were showering into the Condon Bank, Powers told Grat he had been hit in the arm. Grat ordered the employees to lay on the floor in the back office and, after receiving the signal from Bob, told Powers and Broadwell that it was time to leave. The three went out the side door crouching and dashing across Walnut Street to the alley where they had hitched their horses. Bob and Emmett met Grat and the others in the alley, the sacks of money still over their arms. Law enforcement officers hold up the bodies of Bob(23) and Grat(31) Dalton after the attempted Bank Robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas As the Daltons made their way west down the alley towards the horses, town Marshal Charles T. Connelly came through the livery stable into the alley and ran east towards the plaza without noticing the bandits behind him. Grat then shot him in the head and killed him. Following behind Marshal Connelly was John Kloehr, still in the stable. Grat noticed him but before he could aim Kloehr shot him in the throat. Taking fire from the hardware store Bob was hit in the head and the heart, killing him instantly. Powers tried to mount his horse but shots from the store also killed him. Emmett was able to mount his horse unwounded and began riding away but, after noticing Bob was hit, turned around and attempted to lift Bob onto his horse. Emmett was then hit in the back with a load of buckshot. Broadwell was hit several times but managed to ride away. He was found two miles away dead. Emmett(21) at the office of Dr. Walter Wells after the attempted bank robbery in Coffeyville Bill Dalton and Bill Doolin had been waiting several miles away with extra horses to aid the gangs escape. After getting tired of waiting they left, only to learn later the fate of the gang. Grat and Bob Dalton, Dick Broadwell and Bill Powers were all killed. Emmett Dalton received 23 gunshot wounds and survived (he was shot through the right arm, below the shoulder, through the left ‚Äì right, in some accounts ‚Äì hip and groin, and received 18-23 buckshot in his back). He was given a life sentence in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas, of which he served 14 years before being pardoned. He moved to Hollywood, California and became a real estate agent, author and actor, and died in 1937 at age 66. Bill Doolin, \\"Bitter Creek\\" Newcomb, and Charlie Pierce, none of whom were at Coffeyville, were the only members left of the original Dalton Gang. Years after the robberies and his release from prison, Emmett Dalton said that the relentless pressure put on them by Deputy US Marshal Heck Thomas as he hunted for them was a key factor in his gang's decision to commit the robberies. They hoped that a big haul from the banks would allow them to leave the territory and escape Thomas' heat. For a time, Bill Doolin and his partners operated under outlaw Henry Starr (Cherokee), hiding out about 75 miles northeast of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, from where they made several raids. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce visited the Daltons' mother in Kingfisher to console her after her sons' deaths. Brothers Lit and Bill Dalton were also visiting their mother, and Doolin proposed that they join him and his group to avenge their brothers. Bill Dalton agreed to join them and soon took part in several robberies, but Lit refused in disgust. Henry Starr was arrested in 1893 and held for trial at Fort Smith. As Doolin and Dalton were accepted as leaders of the gang, it became known as the Doolin-Dalton Gang, and also as the Wild Bunch. Dalton took part in several robberies with the Wild Bunch, including a gun battle on September 1, 1893 at Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory, where three deputy U. S. marshals were killed. Eventually Dalton left Doolin to form his own Dalton Gang. On May 23, 1894, Dalton and his new gang robbed the First National Bank at Longview, Texas. During the robbery one member of the gang and four citizens were killed in a shootout. This was the gang's only job. After the gang separated with their share of the loot, Bill hid out with his family in a cabin near near Elk, Indian Territory. A posse assembled by U.S. Marshal S.T. Lindsey in Ardmore, Oklahoma, tracked Bill to the cabin and surrounded it on June 8, 1894. Dalton escaped through a window at the back of the house, but as he ran through a patch of corn was shot and killed by the Deputy Marshals. Lit, the last surviving Dalton brother, responded to a book written by his brother Emmett after the latter's death. Lit said that Emmett's book, When the Daltons Rode (1931), was largely fabrication. Emmett had denied accompanying Bob to California. On his death bed, Emmett told Frank Forrest Latta that he had robbed a train in California, and had used the alias William McElhanie. He asked Latta not to publish the information until after his death. In her unpublished novella, Grat Dalton's Ride, Eva Evans, the daughter of the infamous California outlaw Chris Evans, tells the story of Grat Dalton's escape from California after the Alila robbery. In it she implied that her father was the one who helped Grat Dalton escape from the Visalia Jail, lending credibility to an earlier claim made by Sheriff Gene Kay of this being true.

He founded the Knights of Columbus at a local parish to serve as a mutual aid and fraternal insurance organization, particularly for immigrants and their families. It developed through the 20th century as the world's largest Catholic fraternal organization. The cause for his canonization started in the Archdiocese of Hartford in 1996; in March 2008, Pope Benedict XVI declared McGivney \\"Venerable\\" in recognition of his \\"heroic virtue\\". On May 27, 2020, it was announced by Pope Francis that McGivney had been approved for beatification, which will officially happen on October 31, 2020. \\"The Vatican today (May 27) announced that Pope Francis approved the promulgation of a decree recognizing a miracle attributed to the intercession of the founder of the Knights of Columbus, Venerable Father Michael J. McGivney, a Connecticut priest who served his flock during the pandemic of 1890, before himself becoming ill and dying of pneumonia. The pope‚Äôs action means that Father McGivney can be declared ‚ÄúBlessed,‚Äù the step just prior to sainthood. An additional miracle attributed to Father McGivney's intercession will be required for his canonization as a saint.\\" Early life He was born to Irish immigrant parents, Patrick and Mary (Lynch) McGivney. He was the eldest of 13 children, six of whom died in infancy or childhood. His father worked as a molder in a Waterbury, Connecticut, brass mill. Michael attended the local Waterbury district school but left at 13 to work in the spoon-making department of one of the brass mills. Studies In 1868, at the age of 16, he entered the S√©minaire de Saint-Hyacinthe in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada. He continued his studies at Our Lady of Angels Seminary, near Niagara Falls, New York, (1871‚Äì1872) and at the Jesuits' St. Mary's College, in Montreal, Quebec. He had to leave the seminary, returning home to help finish raising his siblings after the death of his father, in June 1873. McGivney later resumed his studies at St. Mary's Seminary, in Baltimore, Maryland; he was ordained a priest on December 22, 1877, by Archbishop James Gibbons at the Baltimore Cathedral of the Assumption. Michael J. McGivney Founding of the Knights of Columbus From his own experience, McGivney recognized the devastating effect on immigrant families of the untimely death of the father and wage earner. Many Catholics were still struggling to assimilate into the American economy. On March 29, 1882, while an assistant pastor at Saint Mary's Church in New Haven, Connecticut, McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus, with a small group of parishioners,\\"Father Michael McGivney\\", Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network as a mutual aid society, to provide financial assistance, in the event of the men's deaths, to their widows and orphans. The organization developed as a fraternal society. McGivney was also known for his tireless work among his parishioners. McGivney spent seven years at St. Mary's, then became pastor of St. Thomas Church in Thomaston in 1884. He died from pneumonia at the age of 38 in Thomaston on the eve of the Assumption in 1890. The Knights of Columbus was among the first groups to recruit blood donors, with formal efforts dating to 1937 during the Great Depression. As of 2013, the order has more than 1.8 million member families and 15,000 councils. During the 2012 fraternal year, the order donated $167 million and 70 million man-hours to charity.\\"Knights set record for giving $167 million, 70 million volunteer hours, in 2012\\", Catholic Philly, June 2013 By 2020, the order reached 2 million member mark. During the 2019 fraternal year, the order donated $187 million and 77 million man-hours to charity. Cause for canonization Saratoga, California, USA In 1996, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford opened the cause for canonization, an investigation into McGivney's life with a view towards formal recognition by the Catholic Church of his sainthood. Gabriel O'Donnell is the postulator of McGivney's cause. He is also the director of the Fr. McGivney Guild, which now has 150,000 members supporting his cause. The diocesan investigation was closed in 2000, and the case was passed to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Vatican City. On March 15, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI approved a decree recognizing McGivney's heroic virtue, thus declaring him as \\"Venerable.\\" , a miracle attributed to McGivney's intercession was under investigation at the Vatican. On May 27, 2020, the miracle attributed to the intercession of McGivney was approved by Congregation for the Causes of Saints and authorized by Pope Francis. The beatification Mass for McGivney is scheduled for October 31, 2020, in Hartford, Connecticut, according to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.

The Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot conditions, also referred to as Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot jump conditions or Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot relations, describe the relationship between the states on both sides of a shock wave or a combustion wave (deflagration or detonation) in a one-dimensional flow in fluids or a one-dimensional deformation in solids. They are named in recognition of the work carried out by Scottish engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine and French engineer Pierre Henri Hugoniot. See also: Hugoniot, H.

In a coordinate system that is moving with the discontinuity, the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot conditions can be expressed as:Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\rho_1\\\\,u_1 &= \\\\rho_2\\\\,u_2 \\\\equiv m && \\\\text{Conservation of mass} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho_1\\\\,u_1^2 + p_1 &= \\\\rho_2\\\\,u_2^2 + p_2 && \\\\text{Conservation of momentum} \\\\\\\\\\\\ h_1 + \\\\frac{1}{2}u_1^2 &= h_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}u_2^2 && \\\\text{Conservation of energy} \\\\end{align} where m is the mass flow rate per unit area, œÅ1 and œÅ2 are the mass density of the fluid upstream and downstream of the wave, u1 and u2 are the fluid velocity upstream and downstream of the wave, p1 and p2 are the pressures in the two regions, and h1 and h2 are the specific (with the sense of per unit mass) enthalpies in the two regions. If in addition, the flow is reactive, then the species conservation equations demands that :\\\\omega_{i,1}=\\\\omega_{i,2}=0,\\\\quad i = 1,2,3,...N, \\\\qquad \\\\text{Conservation of species} to vanish both upstream and downstream of the discontinuity. Here, \\\\omega is the mass production rate of the ith species of total N species involved in the reaction. Combining conservation of mass and momentum gives us :\\\\frac{p_2-p_1}{1/\\\\rho_2-1/\\\\rho_1}=-m^2 which defines a straight line known as the Rayleigh line, named after Lord Rayleigh, that has a negative slope (since m^2 is always positive) in the p-\\\\rho^{-1} plane. Using the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum to eliminate u1 and u2, the equation for the conservation of energy can be expressed as the Hugoniot equation: : h_2 - h_1 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_2}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_1}\\\\right)\\\\,(p_2 - p_1). The inverse of the density can also be expressed as the specific volume, v=1/\\\\rho. Along with these, one has to specify the relation between the upstream and downstream equation of state : f(p_1,\\\\rho_1,T_1,Y_{i,1})=f(p_2,\\\\rho_2,T_2,Y_{i,2}) where Y_i is the mass fraction of the species. Finally, the calorific equation of state h=h(p,\\\\rho,Y_i) is assumed to be known, i.e., : h(p_1,\\\\rho_1,Y_{i,1})=h(p_2,\\\\rho_2,Y_{i,2}). Simplified Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot relationsWilliams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press. The following assumptions are made in order to simplify the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations. The mixture is assumed to obey the ideal gas law, so that relation between the downstream and upstream equation of state can be written as :\\\\frac{p_2}{\\\\rho_2T_2}=\\\\frac{p_1}{\\\\rho_1T_1}=\\\\frac{R}{\\\\overline W} where R is the universal gas constant and the mean molecular weight \\\\overline W is assumed to be constant (otherwise, \\\\overline W would depend on the mass fraction of the all species). If one assumes that the specific heat at constant pressure c_p is also constant across the wave, the change in enthalpies (calorific equation of state) can be simply written as :h_2-h_1 = -q + c_p(T_2-T_1) where the first term in the above expression represents the amount of heat released per unit mass of the upstream mixture by the wave and the second term represents the sensible heating. Eliminating temperature using the equation of state and substituting the above expression for the change in enthalpies into the Hugoniot equation, one obtains a Hugoniot equation expressed only in terms of pressure and densities, :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma-1}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{p_2}{\\\\rho_2}-\\\\frac{p_1}{\\\\rho_1}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_2}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_1}\\\\right)(p_2-p_1) = q, where \\\\gamma is the specific heat ratio. Hugoniot curve without heat release (q=0) is often called as Shock Hugoniot. Along with the Rayleigh line equation, the above equation completely determines the state of the system. These two equations can be written compactly by introducing the following non- dimensional scales, :\\\\tilde p = \\\\frac{p_2}{p_1},\\\\quad \\\\tilde v = \\\\frac{\\\\rho_1}{\\\\rho_2}, \\\\quad \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{q\\\\rho_1}{p_1}, \\\\quad \\\\mu = \\\\frac{m^2}{p_1\\\\rho_1}. The Rayleigh line equation and the Hugoniot equation then simplifies to :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\tilde p-1}{\\\\tilde v-1} &= -\\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tilde p &= \\\\frac{[2\\\\alpha + (\\\\gamma+1)/(\\\\gamma-1)]-\\\\tilde v}{[(\\\\gamma+1)/(\\\\gamma-1)]\\\\tilde v-1}. \\\\end{align} Given the upstream conditions, the intersection of above two equations in the \\\\tilde p-\\\\tilde v plane determine the downstream conditions. If no heat release occurs, for example, shock waves without chemical reaction, then \\\\alpha=0. The Hugoniot curves asymptote to the lines \\\\tilde v = (\\\\gamma-1)/(\\\\gamma+1) and \\\\tilde p=-(\\\\gamma-1)/(\\\\gamma+1), i.e., the pressure jump across the wave can take any values between 0\\\\leq \\\\tilde p<\\\\infty, but the specific volume ratio is restricted to the interval (\\\\gamma-1)/(\\\\gamma+1)\\\\leq \\\\tilde v \\\\leq 2\\\\alpha + (\\\\gamma+1)/(\\\\gamma-1) (the upper bound is derived for the case \\\\tilde p\\\\rightarrow 0 because pressure cannot take negative values). The Chapman‚ÄìJouguet condition is where Rayleigh line is tangent to the Hugoniot curve. If \\\\gamma=1.4 (diatomic gas without the vibrational mode excitation), the interval is 1/6\\\\leq \\\\tilde v\\\\leq 2\\\\alpha + 6, in other words, the shock wave can increase the density at most by a factor of 6. For monoatomic gas, \\\\gamma=5/3, therefore the density ratio is limited by the interval 1/4\\\\leq \\\\tilde v\\\\leq 2\\\\alpha + 4. For diatomic gases with vibrational mode excited, we have \\\\gamma=9/7 leading to the interval 1/8\\\\leq \\\\tilde v\\\\leq 2\\\\alpha + 8. In reality, the specific heat ratio is not constant in the shock wave due to molecular dissociation and ionization, but even in these cases, density ratio in general do not exceed the factor 11-13.Zel‚ÄôDovich, Y. B., & Raizer, Y. P. (2012). Physics of shock waves and high-temperature hydrodynamic phenomena. Courier Corporation. Derivation from Euler equations Consider gas in a one-dimensional container (e.g., a long thin tube). Assume that the fluid is inviscid (i.e., it shows no viscosity effects as for example friction with the tube walls). Furthermore, assume that there is no heat transfer by conduction or radiation and that gravitational acceleration can be neglected. Such a system can be described by the following system of conservation laws, known as the 1D Euler equations, that in conservation form is: ::(\\\\;1)\\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} \\\\;\\\\; = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left(\\\\rho u\\\\right) ::(\\\\;2)\\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}(\\\\rho u) \\\\, = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left(\\\\rho u^2 + p\\\\right) ::(\\\\;3)\\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\left(E^t\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left[u\\\\left(E^t + p\\\\right)\\\\right], where :\\\\rho,\\\\, fluid mass density, :u,\\\\, fluid velocity, :e,\\\\, specific internal energy of the fluid, :p,\\\\, fluid pressure, and :E^t = \\\\rho e + \\\\rho\\\\frac{1}{2}u^2,\\\\, is the total energy density of the fluid, [J/m3], while e is its specific internal energy Assume further that the gas is calorically ideal and that therefore a polytropic equation-of-state of the simple form ::(\\\\;4)\\\\quad\\\\quad p = \\\\left(\\\\gamma - 1\\\\right)\\\\rho e, is valid, where \\\\gamma is the constant ratio of specific heats c_p/c_v. This quantity also appears as the polytropic exponent of the polytropic process described by ::(\\\\;5)\\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho^\\\\gamma} = \\\\text{constant}. For an extensive list of compressible flow equations, etc., refer to NACA Report 1135 (1953). Note: For a calorically ideal gas \\\\gamma \\\\, is a constant and for a thermally ideal gas \\\\gamma \\\\, is a function of temperature. In the latter case, the dependence of pressure on mass density and internal energy might differ from that given by equation (4). =The jump condition= Before proceeding further it is necessary to introduce the concept of a jump condition ‚Äì a condition that holds at a discontinuity or abrupt change. Consider a 1D situation where there is a jump in the scalar conserved physical quantity w, which is governed by integral conservation law :: (\\\\;6) \\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\int_{x_1}^{x_2}w \\\\, dx = -\\\\left.f\\\\left(w\\\\right)\\\\right_{x_1}^{x_2} for any x_1, x_2, x_1, and, therefore, by partial differential equation :: (\\\\;6') \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}f\\\\left(w\\\\right)=0 for smooth solutions.Note that the integral conservation law \\\\scriptstyle(6) could not, in general, be obtained from differential equation \\\\scriptstyle(6') by integraition over \\\\scriptstyle[x_1;x_2] because \\\\scriptstyle(6') holds for smooth solutions only. Let the solution exhibit a jump (or shock) at x=x_{s}(t), where x_{1} < x_{s}(t) and x_{s}(t) < x_{2}, then ::(\\\\;7) \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\int_{x_1}^{x_s(t)}w \\\\, dx + \\\\int_{x_s(t)}^{x_2} w\\\\,dx \\\\right) \\\\right] = -\\\\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}f\\\\left(w\\\\right)\\\\,dx ::(\\\\;8) \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\therefore w_1\\\\frac{dx_s}{dt} - w_2\\\\frac{dx_s}{dt} + \\\\int_{x_1}^{x_s(t)} w_t \\\\, dx + \\\\int_{x_s(t)}^{x_2}w_t \\\\, dx = -\\\\left.f\\\\left(w\\\\right)\\\\right_{x_1}^{x_2} The subscripts 1 and 2 indicate conditions just upstream and just downstream of the jump respectively, i.e. w_1 = \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\rightarrow 0^{+}} w\\\\left(x_s - \\\\epsilon\\\\right) and w_2 = \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\rightarrow 0^{+}} w\\\\left(x_s + \\\\epsilon\\\\right). Note, to arrive at equation (8) we have used the fact that dx_1/dt = 0 and dx_2/dt = 0. Now, let x_1 \\\\rightarrow x_s(t) - \\\\epsilon and x_2 \\\\rightarrow x_s(t) + \\\\epsilon, when we have \\\\int_{x_1}^{x_s(t)-\\\\epsilon}w_t \\\\, dx \\\\rightarrow 0 and \\\\int_{x_s(t)+\\\\epsilon}^{x_2}w_t \\\\, dx \\\\rightarrow 0, and in the limit :: (\\\\;9) \\\\quad\\\\quad u_s\\\\left(w_1 - w_2\\\\right) = f \\\\left(w_1\\\\right) - f \\\\left(w_2\\\\right), where we have defined u_s = dx_s(t)/dt \\\\, (the system characteristic or shock speed), which by simple division is given by :: (10) \\\\quad\\\\quad u_s = \\\\frac{f\\\\left(w_1\\\\right) - f\\\\left(w_2\\\\right)}{w_1 - w_2}. Equation (9) represents the jump condition for conservation law (6). A shock situation arises in a system where its characteristics intersect, and under these conditions a requirement for a unique single-valued solution is that the solution should satisfy the admissibility condition or entropy condition. For physically real applications this means that the solution should satisfy the Lax entropy condition :: (11) \\\\quad\\\\quad f^{\\\\prime} \\\\left(w_1\\\\right) > u_s > f^{\\\\prime} \\\\left( w_2 \\\\right), where f^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(w_1\\\\right) and f^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(w_2\\\\right) represent characteristic speeds at upstream and downstream conditions respectively. =Shock condition= In the case of the hyperbolic conservation law (6), we have seen that the shock speed can be obtained by simple division. However, for the 1D Euler equations ( 1), ( 2) and ( 3), we have the vector state variable \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\rho & \\\\rho u & E\\\\end{bmatrix}^\\\\mathsf{T} and the jump conditions become ::(12)\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\; u_s\\\\left(\\\\rho_2 - \\\\rho_1\\\\right) = \\\\rho_2 u_2 - \\\\rho_1 u_1 ::(13)\\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\; u_s\\\\left(\\\\rho_2 u_2 - \\\\rho_1 u_1\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\rho_2 u_2^2 + p_2\\\\right) - \\\\left(\\\\rho_1 u_1^2 + p_1\\\\right) ::(14)\\\\quad\\\\quad u_s\\\\left(E_2 - E_1 \\\\right) = \\\\left[\\\\rho_2 u_2 \\\\left(e_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} u_2^2 + \\\\frac{p_2}{\\\\rho_2}\\\\right)\\\\right] - \\\\left[\\\\rho_1 u_1 \\\\left(e_1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 + \\\\frac{p_1}{\\\\rho_1}\\\\right)\\\\right]. Equations (12), (13) and (14) are known as the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot conditions for the Euler equations and are derived by enforcing the conservation laws in integral form over a control volume that includes the shock. For this situation u_s cannot be obtained by simple division. However, it can be shown by transforming the problem to a moving co-ordinate system (setting u_s' := u_s - u_1, u'_1 := 0, u'_2 := u_2 - u_1 to remove u_1) and some algebraic manipulation (involving the elimination of u'_2 from the transformed equation (13) using the transformed equation (12)), that the shock speed is given by ::(15)\\\\quad\\\\quad u_s = u_1 + c_1 \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{\\\\gamma+1}{2\\\\gamma} \\\\left( \\\\frac{p_2}{p_1} - 1\\\\right)}, where c_{1}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma p_{1}/\\\\rho_{1}} is the speed of sound in the fluid at upstream conditions.Liepmann, H.

If , the curve will intersect the specific volume axis at the point v1. Hugoniot elastic limit in the p-v plane for a shock in an elastic-plastic material. For shocks in solids, a closed form expression such as equation (15) cannot be derived from first principles. Instead, experimental observations indicate that a linear relation Though a linear relation is widely assumed to hold, experimental data suggest that almost 80% of tested materials do not satisfy this widely accepted linear behavior. See Kerley, G. I, 2006, \\"The Linear US-uP Relation in Shock-Wave Physics\\", ; for details. can be used instead (called the shock Hugoniot in the us-up plane) that has the form : u_s = c_0 + s\\\\,u_p = c_0 + s \\\\,u_2 where c0 is the bulk speed of sound in the material (in uniaxial compression), s is a parameter (the slope of the shock Hugoniot) obtained from fits to experimental data, and is the particle velocity inside the compressed region behind the shock front. The above relation, when combined with the Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, can be used to determine the shock Hugoniot in the p-v plane, where v is the specific volume (per unit mass):Poirier, J-P. (2008) \\"Introduction to the Physics of the Earth's Interior\\", Cambridge University Press. : p_2 - p_1 = \\\\frac{c_0^2\\\\, \\\\rho_1\\\\, \\\\rho_2\\\\, \\\\left(\\\\rho_2 - \\\\rho_1\\\\right)}{\\\\left[\\\\rho_2 - s\\\\left(\\\\rho_2 - \\\\rho_1\\\\right)\\\\right]^2} = \\\\frac{c_0^2\\\\,\\\\left(v_1 - v_2\\\\right)}{\\\\left[v_1 - s\\\\left(v_1 - v_2\\\\right)\\\\right]^2} \\\\,. Alternative equations of state, such as the Mie‚ÄìGr√ºneisen equation of state may also be used instead of the above equation. The shock Hugoniot describes the locus of all possible thermodynamic states a material can exist in behind a shock, projected onto a two dimensional state-state plane. It is therefore a set of equilibrium states and does not specifically represent the path through which a material undergoes transformation. Weak shocks are isentropic and that the isentrope represents the path through which the material is loaded from the initial to final states by a compression wave with converging characteristics. In the case of weak shocks, the Hugoniot will therefore fall directly on the isentrope and can be used directly as the equivalent path. In the case of a strong shock we can no longer make that simplification directly. However, for engineering calculations, it is deemed that the isentrope is close enough to the Hugoniot that the same assumption can be made. If the Hugoniot is approximately the loading path between states for an \\"equivalent\\" compression wave, then the jump conditions for the shock loading path can be determined by drawing a straight line between the initial and final states. This line is called the Rayleigh line and has the following equation: : p_2 - p_1 = u_s^2\\\\left(\\\\rho_1 - \\\\frac{\\\\rho_1^2}{\\\\rho_2}\\\\right)\\\\, = Hugoniot elastic limit = Most solid materials undergo plastic deformations when subjected to strong shocks. The point on the shock Hugoniot at which a material transitions from a purely elastic state to an elastic-plastic state is called the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and the pressure at which this transition takes place is denoted pHEL. Values of pHEL can range from 0.2 GPa to 20 GPa. Above the HEL, the material loses much of its shear strength and starts behaving like a fluid.

History In 1940, during the height of the Blitz, there was a strong desire to reward the many acts of civilian courage. The existing awards open to civilians were not judged suitable to meet the new situation; therefore it was decided that the George Cross and the GM would be instituted to recognise both civilian gallantry in the face of enemy bombing, and brave deeds more generally. Announcing the new awards, the King said: The warrant for the GM (along with that of the GC), dated 24 January 1941, was published in The London Gazette on 31 January 1941. Criteria The medal is granted in recognition of \\"acts of great bravery\\".The London Gazette, 31 January 1941 ‚Äì Warrant, Fifth clause The original warrant for the George Medal did not explicitly permit it to be awarded posthumously. This was changed in December 1977 to allow posthumous awards, several of which have been subsequently made. The medal is primarily a civilian award, but it may be awarded to military personnel for gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy.Which could not therefore be recognised by a military decoration; such awards typically require gallantry in the face of the enemy.

Recipients Posthumous armorial achievement of Ignacio Echeverr√≠a embellished with his Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit (Spain), Silver Medal of the Order of Police Merit (Spain) and George Medal The first recipients, listed in The London Gazette of 30 September 1940, were Chief Officer Ernest Herbert Harmer and Second Officer Cyril William Arthur Brown of the Dover Fire Brigade, and Section Officer Alexander Edmund Campbell of the Dover Auxiliary Fire Service, who on 29 July had volunteered to return to a ship loaded with explosives in Dover Harbour to fight fires aboard while an air raid was in progress. Seven other people were also awarded the medal, including the first women; Ambulance Driver Dorothy Clarke and Ambulance Attendant Bessie Jane Hepburn of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, for rescuing a man badly injured in an explosion. The first recipient chronologically was Coxswain Robert Cross, commander of the RNLI lifeboat City of Bradford, based at Spurn Point, whose award was gazetted on 7 February 1941. It was awarded for an incident on 2 February 1940 when Cross took the lifeboat out in gale force winds, snowsqualls, and very rough seas to rescue the crew of a steam trawler. The youngest recipient was Charity Anne Bick, who lied about her age to join the ARP service at 14 years old, and who delivered several messages by bicycle during a heavy air raid in West Bromwich in late 1940. The first person to receive a second award was George Samuel Sewell, an engineer working for Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd., based at the oil terminal at Salt End, near Hull, for his actions during an air raid. Having been one of the first recipients in September 1940, his bar to the George Medal was gazetted on 4 July 1941. The year 2015 saw the 75th anniversary of the creation of the award, and was marked by a ceremony in London.

In the process, he must also reason out why several shadowy groups, a professional assassin, and the CIA want him dead. The story takes readers on a twisted and dangerous journey into a world of deceptions and conspiracies, offering a psychological portrait of Bourne, and giving them the chance to experience from his point of view the life-or-death decisions he makes as he seeks to piece together the dangerous puzzle of his missing past. It is the first novel of the original Bourne Trilogy, which also includes The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Peter Cannon of Publishers Weekly named The Bourne Identity among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carr√©'s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\\"Crime Fiction Dossier: Top 15 Spy Novels\\". \\"The Rap Sheet: Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy\\" The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper. Plot The preface of the novel consists of two real-life newspaper articles from 1975 about terrorist Ilich Ram√≠rez S√°nchez, known as \\"Carlos the Jackal.\\" The story opens with gunfire on a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. One man is cast into the waves before the boat explodes, and is later picked up by fishermen, who find him clinging to debris. They also find he has amnesia, apparently as a result of a traumatic head injury, with occasional erratic intrusions or flashbacks to the past, but is unable to make sense of them. The only definite evidence of his former life is a small film negative found embedded in his hip containing the information required to access a bank account in Zurich. When he goes to Zurich to gain access to the bank, a clerk recognizes him. From this the man concludes that his name is \\"Jason Charles Bourne\\", that he has relations with a firm called Treadstone Seventy-One Corporation, and that his account holds 7,500,000 Swiss francs (equivalent to $5,000,000 in the novel). Circumstantial evidence leads Bourne to suspect that he should go to Paris, so he wires most of the money there. At the bank and his hotel, men suddenly try to kill Bourne, so he quickly takes another hotel guest, Canadian government economist Marie St. Jacques, as a hostage in order to escape. After escaping from Bourne, St. Jacques reports his whereabouts to men she thinks are police, but they turn out to be Bourne's pursuers and professional killers who try to rape and kill her. When Bourne rescues her at the risk of his own life, St. Jacques decides to help him. They head to Paris to find clues about Bourne's past. Once in Paris, Bourne learns that his attackers' leader may be \\"Carlos,\\" who is described as the most dangerous terrorist of his time, responsible for numerous killings in many countries and well connected in the highest government circles. For reasons only partly comprehensible to himself, Bourne develops a compulsion to hunt Carlos. As the story develops, Bourne follows clues that bring him closer to Carlos, leading him to places such as a designer clothing store used as relay for Carlos. Though Bourne twice briefly sees Carlos, he does not manage to catch or kill him. To his distress, Bourne also finds mounting evidence that he himself is a rival assassin called ‚Ä≥Cain.‚Ä≥ Meanwhile, he and St. Jacques fall in love. Marie tries to convince Bourne that he is not the killer he thinks he was. It turns out that Cain is an alias that had been assumed by Bourne‚Äîwhose real name is not even \\"Bourne\\"‚Äîto hunt down Carlos; Cain took credit for kills as a way of challenging Carlos as part of a top-secret American plot. The plot is called Treadstone Seventy-One, and the truth is known only to eight men selected by covert agencies of the U.S. government; everyone else assumes Cain to be a real person. Due to Bourne's six-month silence (while he was recuperating) and the unauthorized diversion of millions of dollars from the Zurich account, the Treadstone men start to believe that Bourne has become a traitor. They are entirely convinced of his guilt when Carlos has two of his operatives storm the building in which Treadstone is based and kill those inside, and then frames Bourne for the murders. The man now responsible for Treadstone, Alexander Conklin, attempts to lure Bourne into a meeting outside of Paris to kill him. Bourne escapes the trap, but does not succeed in proving his innocence. In Paris, Bourne has managed to convince a French General named Villiers to help him. Bourne realizes that Villiers' wife is a mole for Carlos. When the General hears about it, he finally kills his wife and Bourne takes the blame in order to bait Carlos into following him to the United States. Only after Bourne has left do St. Jacques and Villiers manage to convince Treadstone members that Bourne is innocent, and is continuing to hunt Carlos. In New York, Bourne is confronted by Carlos. They wound each other, but when Carlos is on the verge of killing Bourne, some of the remaining Treadstone members arrive at the scene and force Carlos to retreat. The epilogue sees St. Jacques being told about Bourne's past, most of which had been revealed in fragments already: He had been an American Foreign Service officer stationed in Asia during the Vietnam War as part of an operation codenamed Medusa. When his wife and two children were killed, he joined a paramilitary Special forces unit in Vietnam. During a mission, he discovered and executed the double agent Jason Bourne. He took the name years later when he was recruited for Treadstone. At the novel's end, it is revealed that \\"Bourne\\" has recovered from the encounter with Carlos and probably lives together with St. Jacques. He remains the only one to ever have seen the face of Carlos and may be able to recognize him as a public figure, but is unable to do so due to his erratic memory. As a consequence, he is protected day and night by armed watchmen, in the hope he will one day recover enough to identify Carlos. The plot closes with him remembering his first name, David. Concept Robert Ludlum gave two interviews to Don Swaim of CBS: in 1984 and then two years later in 1986. Ludlum discusses how he came up with the first two novels in the Jason Bourne trilogy - The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. The idea behind the Bourne trilogy came after he had a bout of temporary amnesia. After his first book, The Scarlatti Inheritance, was published, he could not remember 12 hours of his life. This event, combined with thrilling real-life spy stories, inspired him to write the Jason Bourne trilogy.  The name \\"Bourne\\"  In the novel, the name is portrayed as the random last name of a double agent. Only once, in passing and without further explanation or emphasis, the homophone \\"Bourne\\"/\\"born\\" is mentioned, during the showdown between Bourne and Carlos in the last chapter: :to stay alive he had to get (...) away from the place where Cain [i.e. Bourne] was born. Jason Bourne ... there was no humor in the word association. ABC News speculated that the name was actually \\"most likely\\" inspired by Ansel Bourne, a famous 19th-century psychology case due to his experience of a probable dissociative fugue.Lee Ferran (3 August 2007). Bourne's Real Life Identity. ABC News (retrieved November 3, 2013) Ansel Bourne one day left his previous life and built himself a new life with a new profession elsewhere under a new name (\\"A. J. Brown\\"); after two months, he woke up with no memories of this new life, but with memories recovered up to this time and returned to his old life. The rare and controversial dissociative fugue has been described \\"a state in which an individual has lost their identity\\" by Harvard psychologist Daniel Schacter. \\"They don't know who they are, and they've lost all information about their past. They go on functioning automatically.\\" Publication history * 1980, US, Richard Marek , Pub date February 1980, Hardback. * 1982, US, Bantam Books , Pub date April 1, 1982, Paperback. * 1984, US, Bantam Books , Pub date February 1, 1984, Paperback. * 1986, UK, Grafton Pub date June 19, 1986, Hardback. * 1997, UK, HarperCollins , Pub date December 1, 1997, Paperback * 2004, UK, Orion Publishing Group , Pub date May 6, 2004, Paperback. * 2010, UK, Orion Publishing Group , Pub date February 4, 2010, Paperback. Sequels Ludlum wrote two sequels to The Bourne Identity: The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, forming the Bourne Trilogy. After Ludlum's death, author Eric Van Lustbader continued the story of Jason Bourne in The Bourne Legacy (2004), The Bourne Betrayal (2007), The Bourne Sanction (2008), The Bourne Deception (2009), The Bourne Objective (2010), The Bourne Dominion (2011), The Bourne Imperative (2012), The Bourne Retribution (2013), The Bourne Ascendancy (2014), The Bourne Enigma (2016) and The Bourne Initiative (2017). Adaptations The novel has been adapted as The Bourne Identity, a 1988 television movie starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. The story was also partially adapted in the 1989 Tamil language film Vetri Vizha starring Kamal Haasan. The 2002 film The Bourne Identity starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper has largely modernized the material and is only very loosely based on the central premise of the novel.

The author of over 30 books of poetry and prose, Kyger was associated with the poets of the San Francisco Renaissance, the Beat Generation, Black Mountain, and the New York School. Although Kyger is often characterized as a prominent female Beat poet in the predominately male inner circle of Beat Generation writers, she never considered herself as belonging to the Beat movement. Nor did she formally identify with any other movement; her work invokes various schools of poetry without belonging to any of them. In Reconstructing the Beats, Amy L. Friedman calls Kyger ‚Äúan important link between several major axes of American poetry and writing in the twentieth century.‚ÄùAmy L. Friedman, ‚ÄúJoanne Kyger, Beat Generation Poet: ‚Äòa porcupine traveling at the speed of light,‚Äô‚Äù in Reconstructing the Beats, Jennie Skerl (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 73‚Äì88. Linda Russo, in the webzine Jacket‚Äôs edition devoted to Kyger, notes that ‚Äúthere is no one way to talk about her work except as that of a singular individual.‚ÄùLinda Russo, ‚ÄúIntroduction: a context for reading Joanne Kyger,‚Äù Jacket 11 (April 2000), http://jacketmagazine.com/11/kyger-russo.html Kyger‚Äôs early poetry was influenced by Charles Olson‚Äôs ‚Äúprojective verse‚Äù concept of letting breath and open construction, rather than rhyme and syntax, guide poetic composition. This influence continued to shape her mature work. In a 2010 interview Kyger says, ‚ÄúYou want to make it so that someone could say it. I try to ‚Äòscore‚Äô the lines for the page with that in mind, the breathing, the timing.‚ÄùSteve Heilig, ‚ÄúHiding Out With Joanne Kyger, Poet Of West Marin,‚Äù Anderson Valley Advertiser, October 7, 2010, http://theava.com/archives/8474 Unlike Olson, notes Dale Smith in his essay \\"Joanne Kyger and the Narrative of Every Day,\\" Kyger ‚Äúfocuses on events and happenings, moving herself out of the way as a kind of recording instrument . . . faithful to specific moments in time and attendant to the many spirits or moods of landscape.‚ÄùDale Smith, ‚ÄúJoanne Kyger and the Narrative of Every Day,‚Äù Jacket 34 (October 2007), http://jacketmagazine.com/34/kyger-by-smith.shtml In a 2007 review of Kyger‚Äôs book About Now: Collected Poems, Lewis MacAdams describes Kyger as from the ‚ÄúSchool of Backyard Poets, who look out their kitchen windows and see the universe.‚ÄùLewis MacAdams, ‚ÄúThey saw it all,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2007, http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/16/books/bk-macadams16 Kyger's poems emerged from a daily literary practice of recording thoughts, events, and dreams. Most of the poems are dated, either in the title or at the end. Much like journals, they include everything from philosophical musings to the weather. Themes‚Äîarising from her practice of Zen Buddhism, study of consciousness, explorations of ancient Greek and Native American mythologies, frequent travels to Mexico, observations of the natural landscape, and daily life in a small coastal town‚Äîcontinue from book to book, like installments in an autobiography. In a 2011 interview, Kyger says, ‚ÄúI think of notebook writing like a practice‚ÄîI try and do it whether I have anything good or bad or interesting to say.

Kyger moved often, living in China, California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, until the age of 14, when the family (including Kyger‚Äôs two sisters) settled in Santa Barbara.Sam Roberts, ‚ÄúJoanne Kyger, Zen-Infused Beat Generation Poet, Dies at 82,‚Äù Nytimes.com, April 6, 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/books/joanne- kyger-dead-beat-generation-poet.html Her parents separated permanently in 1949. Kyger‚Äôs first published poem appeared in her school‚Äôs literary magazine when she was five. At Santa Barbara High School, Kyger co-edited the features column of the school newspaper with Leland Hickman. In 1952, she enrolled at Santa Barbara College (later University of California, Santa Barbara), where she studied philosophy and literature and started the school‚Äôs first literary magazine. Renowned critic Hugh Kenner introduced her to the works of Modernist poets, such as W. B. Yeats and William Carlos Williams, while Paul Wienpahl introduced her to the works of Wittgenstein and Heidegger. In her 2015 notes from an earlier interview, Kyger recalls that the philosophers inspired her interest in Zen Buddhism: ‚ÄúHeidegger had come to the study of 'nothing.' Then I found D. T. Suzuki's book on Japanese Zen and I thought, Oh! this is where you go with this mind. This 'nothing' is really 'something.‚Äô‚ÄùDavid Chadwick, ‚ÄúJoanne Kyger updated cuke interview with corrections,‚Äù Cuke.com, March 2015, http://www.cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/interviews/kyger-2.htm. Kyger left the university in 1956, one freshman biology course short of a degree in philosophy and literature. =San Francisco Renaissance and the Beats= Kyger moved to San Francisco 1957 at the age of 22, where she met Richard Brautigan, who introduced her to City Lights Bookstore and the bohemian neighborhood of North Beach. Working in Brentano's bookstore in the City of Paris department store by day and sharing her poetry at The Place bar by night, Kyger became a part of the literary scene that included Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Michael McClure, Kenneth Rexroth, John Wieners, and former Black Mountain students William McNeill, Ebbe Borregaard, and Michael Rumaker. San Francisco Renaissance poets Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer became Kyger's mentors, and she was invited to join the Sunday Meetings, presided over by Spicer, where she read her poems aloud. In 1958, Kyger met Gary Snyder, whom she would marry in 1960. Snyder introduced Kyger to Philip Whalen, and they became lifelong friends, sharing the sensibilities that defined their similar poetic styles. Kyger‚Äôs print debut, \\"Tapestry #3,\\" appeared in Spicer's mimeographed magazine J No. 4 in 1959, and she gave her first public poetry reading on March 7, 1959, at the Beer and Wine Mission. During this period she moved to the East- West House, a communal center for those interested in Asian studies, and studied with Shunryu Suzuki Roshi at the Sokoji Temple in Japantown. =Japan and India= On January 30, 1960, Kyger left California by ship to join Snyder in Kyoto, Japan. Since Japanese customs frowned upon unmarried couples living together, they were married at the American Consulate in Kobe on February 23, three days after Kyger arrived in Japan, followed by a Zen marriage ceremony performed at Daitoku-ji in Kyoto five days later. While living in Japan, Kyger wrote poetry, studied Buddhism with Ruth Fuller Sasaki at Ryosen-an‚Äîthe zendo of the First Zen Institute's Kyoto branch, learned flower arranging, taught English, and acted in small roles in Japanese B movies. In December 1961, Kyger and Snyder traveled to India with Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky. They met with the Dalai Lama in March 1962. The following month, Kyger and Snyder continued their travels in Singapore, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. During this period, in addition to writing poems that would be included in her first book, Kyger recorded her travels in diaries, which were published in 1981 as The Japan and India Journals 1960‚Äì1964. The autobiographical text‚Äîwhich chronicles, in part, her growing frustration with Snyder‚Äôs expectations and Ginsberg‚Äôs antics‚Äîis considered an important document of the Beat era, offering a rare female perspective on the male-centric movement. In the foreword of the 2000 reissue of the book, Anne Waldman calls it ‚Äúone of the finest books ever in the genre of ‚Äòjournal writing‚Äô‚Äù and ‚Äúa surprisingly (surreptitiously) feminist tract as well: woman artist struggles for identity and independence in the 1960s.‚ÄùAnne Waldman, introduction to Strange Big Moon: The Japan and India Journals, 1960‚Äì1964, by Joanne Kyger (Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, 2000). =Early successes= In January 1964, Kyger left Snyder to his studies in Japan and returned alone, her marriage disintegrated, to San Francisco. She met painter and student of Buddhism Jack Boyce and married him in 1965 after divorcing Snyder. The same year, she participated in the Berkeley Poetry Conference, meeting poets Charles Olson and Ted Berrigan. She edited an edition of Wild Dog magazine, and The Tapestry and the Web, her first book of poems‚Äîwith drawings by Boyce‚Äîwas published. The following year, Kyger and Boyce visited Europe. They settled in New York City for a year, befriending poets Anne Waldman and Lewis Warsh. There, Kyger associated with New York School poets including Michael Brownstein, Larry Fagin, Tom Clark, and Berrigan. She was briefly associated with the Yippie movement. In 1967, Kyger received a residency at the National Center for Experiments in Television in San Francisco. Drawing on Descartes's Discourse on the Method, she translated the philosopher's work into a poem-video titled \\"Descartes and the Splendor of. A Real Drama of Everyday Life. In Six Parts.\\" The video, Kyger‚Äôs only one, aired in November 1968. During this period, she met Carlos Castaneda and Michael Harner and discussed the illusions of a peyote vision she had in 1959. =The Bolinas years= At the end of the '60s, Kyger joined other poets following the back-to-the-land movement. In 1969 she settled in the small coastal town of Bolinas, California, with Jack Boyce. The community and the landscape of Bolinas would feature prominently in her work from that point on. Among her friends, neighbors, and collaborators attracted to the liberal, arts-based community were poets Robert Creeley, Bill Berkson, Jim Carroll, Bobbie Louise Hawkins, Alice Notley, Lewis MacAdams, Duncan McNaughton, and Aram Saroyan, as well as artists Ken Botto, Joe Brainard, Tom Field, and Arthur Okamura. In 1970, she separated from Jack Boyce, and the following year, she bought a house on the Bolinas Mesa, which she shared with Peter Warshall. In 1971, she accompanied Warshall and a group of Harvard students to Puerto Rico to study a colony of rhesus monkeys, and embarked on a Carl Jung‚Äìinspired study of dreams that became Desecheo Notebook, published the same year. Kyger and Warshall also traveled to Chiapas, Mexico. Kyger's All This Every Day, was written at that time and published in 1975, the year her relationship with Warshall ended. In the mid-70s, she began teaching occasionally at the New College of California, an activity she continued until 2001. In 1977, she also became a regular teacher in the summer writing program at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. There she met Canadian-American writer, artist, and naturalist Donald Guravich, who would become her lifelong partner and collaborator. He joined her permanently in Bolinas in 1978 and they were married in 2013. They lived in Bolinas until her death in 2017. =Mexico= Beginning in the mid-80s and continuing for almost three decades, Kyger and Guravich frequently traveled to Mexico, often to Oaxaca, but also to Quintana Roo, Yucat√°n, Chiapis, Patzcuaro, Michoacan and Veracruz. These trips provided inspiration for several volumes of Kyger's poetry, including Phenomenological, an edition in the series A Curriculum of the Soul that explores the nature of consciousness. =Later life and death= Kyger became the Wednesday editor of the Bolinas Hearsay News in 1984, a post she held for over 20 years. During this period, she continued teaching occasionally at Naropa University and the New College, as well as teaching at Mills College and offering writing classes in Bolinas. In 2000, her 1981 collection of autobiographical writings was reissued as Strange Big Moon: Japan and India Journals, 1960‚Äì1964. More recent poetry collections include Again: Poems 1989‚Äì2000, As Ever: Selected Poems, The Distressed Look, and God Never Dies. In 2006 she was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. About Now: Collected Poems was published in 2007 by the National Poetry Foundation and received the 2008 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles National Literary Award for Poetry. On Time: Poems 2005‚Äì2014, one of her last book of poems, was published by City Lights in 2015. Kyger describes her work in her 2005 artist statement: Buddhism Without A Book Well, you had to find it some where another person passed simplicity on to you, the practice of some syllables the position of a seated body and you believe a lineage of recognition of 'mind' not perfect, but intimate with suffering and the futility of maintaining those troublesome states of fear and hate \\"Try this Lift the corners of your mouth slightly and take three breaths this is known as mouth yoga\\" ( * Yvonne Rand) It has nothing to do with smiling It has nothing to do with happiness MARCH 7, 2003 Joanne Kyger was not just a student of Zen Buddhism, but an advocate for the simpler, calmer way of life it practiced. Though she often took hallucinogenic medication to achieve such a state, she only encouraged others to search for serenity of mind, body, and soul. Per definition, ‚ÄúZen meditation, is a way of vigilance and self-discovery which is practiced while sitting on a meditation cushion. It is the experience of living from moment to moment, in the here and now.‚Äù She embraced this lifestyle completely as shown throughout her poetry, even in her later works. In ‚ÄúBuddhism Without A Book,‚Äù the speaker highlights how Buddhism is not just a religion but a state of being, which one can partake in even if they do not possess an instruction manual. As the speaker states, ‚Äúanother person passed simplicity on to you,‚Äù which suggests it is a lifestyle to be shared in hopes of helping those with ‚Äúfear and hate‚Äù (2-3, 11). For those who are fearful of the proper way to meditate, she calms them with the reassurance that it is ‚Äúnot perfect, but intimate;‚Äù therefore, one does not need to have all the right yoga positions because all one needs is his/her ‚Äúmind‚Äù (6,5). She does not want to pressure people into a philosophy, but rather a release from ‚Äúthe futility of maintaining/ those troublesome states‚Äù (8-9). This way of life is an antidote to a world of violence, hate, and hostility. All it takes is a moment to ‚Äúlift the corners of your mouth slightly/ and take three breaths‚Äù to achieve a state of calm in a world in constant turmoil (12-3). Kyger died at age 82 on March 22, 2017, at her home in Bolinas, California, from lung cancer, in the company of her husband, Donald Guravich. Kyger had been working on a new book, There You Are: Interviews, Journals, and Ephemera. It was published in September 2017 by Wave Books.

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred on April 18, sending shock waves through the insurance industry, threatening to destroy its entire existence. With this gloom hanging over the industry, the group was founded as a one-time joke to initiate three new unsuspecting insurance fieldmen into a fake lodge, the Ancient and Honorable Order of the Blue Goose, during the Wisconsin Fieldmen's Meeting on the evening of June 19, 1906, at the Oakwood Hotel in Green Lake, Wisconsin, United States. The \\"fake lodge\\" soon grew to have thousands of members throughout the United States and Canada. International Headquarters are maintained near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States at the Wisconsin Home Nest.  Organization  Local chapters are called \\"Ponds\\". Each Pond has six officers: Most Loyal Gander, the president; Supervisor of the Flock, vice-president; Custodian of the Goslings, warden; Guardian of the Pond, door guard; Wielder of the Goose Quill, secretary; Keeper of the Golden Goose Egg, treasurer.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B.

A fledgling group was even started in Australia. Blue Goose is governed by the Grand Nest, with each Pond sending two delegates, and which then elects a group of officers, one each from each of the five regions. Blue Goose has an annual Grand Nest Meeting of delegates, which is a Summer convention held at various locations throughout the United States and Canada, where its members (Ganders) and their families meet for fun and fellowship. There is usually a large class of new members (Goslings) initiated at that meeting.  Membership  In 1922 there were reportedly 5,000 members of the Order.Preuss p.35 There were 10,000 members in 1989.Axelrod p.34 As of June 22, 2013, membership stood at 3800 Ganders.Blue Goose Membership Database, Membership Summary Report (June 22, 2013)  Ritual  The Cardinal Principles of the order are Character, Charity and Fellowship. There is a secret key honk (password) and a secret salutation that have existed since the flight of the first Blue Goose on June 19, 1906.  Philanthropy  The Order promotes fellowship among insurance professionals and charitable giving. Although the official international charity is Special Olympics, each Pond is free to support whatever local charitable endeavor they choose such as food donations, clothing drives, and donations of time and service to charitable causes. The International Charity Report for FY July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013, reports that the organization gave a reported $171,164.98 in cash donations to various charities. Some Ponds did not submit reports. Ponds also gave hundreds of man-hours to charitable endeavors, plus unknown quantities of donations-in-kind of books, clothing, food, games, toys, etc. Additionally, Ponds gave scholarships totaling $7,750.Charity Report 2012-2013 (June 30, 2013) submitted by GKGGE Linda Meik, Chairman of International Charity Committee  Grand Nest of the Blue Goose  There was also a splinter or imitation of the society, known as the Grand Nest of the Blue Goose, founded in 1906 and based in Kansas and Missouri.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. The dysfunctional family consists of Papa Bear (sometimes called Henry), Mama Bear, and Junior Bear (sometimes spelled Junyer or Joonyer). The characters were featured in five theatrical cartoons released between 1944 and 1951. Characters *Henry Bear (better known as Papa Bear) is the father of Junior Bear and the husband of Mama Bear. Papa is a mean, violent, nasty, loud-mouthed, short-tempered, nervous and often abusive little dwarf bear. He would usually punch or kick Junior (an over-sized muscular buffoon) if he does something wrong or says something stupid. He's never abusive with Mama Bear (except for near the end of What's Brewin', Bruin?) but would sometimes act rude to her, such as telling her to \\"shut up\\" (especially when she's trying to tell him something important). *Mama Bear is the mother of Junior Bear and the wife of Papa Bear. Mama Bear is the long-suffering, polite, and considerate (and deadpan) middle- bear, although she often resorts to thwacking one of them with a rolled-up newspaper to keep the peace. She would usually try to tell Henry something important, but Henry usually just tells her to \\"shut up\\" and won't listen. While she doesn't seem to show it, she has a great deal of affection for her husband; however, when Bugs Bunny flirted her in order to distract her and gave her a kiss on the lips, she took it a bit too seriously and gained a crush on him. Mama Bear attempted to seduce him and inevitably left his face covered with lipstick marks, much to his dismay. *Junior Bear (sometimes spelled Junyer or Joonyer) is the child of Henry Bear and Mama Bear. He is seven years old, yet he is twice as tall as his parents, and has a heavy voice. He is very dim-witted, naive, and childish, but has a good heart. He idolizes his \\"good old Pa\\", who is often abusive toward him. He appears to be an adult because of his size, but still is a child. Junior still wears diapers even though he is seven years old. First appearance Animator Chuck Jones introduced the trio in the 1944 cartoon Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears, in which Bugs Bunny invades the home of the three bears, and Mama Bear takes a fancy to him. In the short, Papa Bear tries to feed his starving family by having them act out their roles in the traditional fairy tale from which they derive their name. Unfortunately for them, when they were out of porridge, Mama substitutes carrot soup for it, and the \\"Goldilocks\\" they lure turns out to be Bugs. Purcell and Liepien, in Parallel Curriculum Units for Social Studies, Grades 6-12, recommended this film as part of the study of the sociological implications of humor; Steven Case, in Toons That Teach, also mines this work for pedagogic value. Further theatrical appearances Jones brought back the Bears for his 1948 cartoon What's Brewin', Bruin?, this time without Bugs. Here, Papa Bear decides that it's time for the Bears to hibernate; however, various disturbances interfere. Junior's voice is here supplied by Stan Freberg. Other Three Bears cartoons included Bear Feat, released in 1948 and Bee-Deviled Bruin, released in 1949. The final Three Bears cartoon of the classic era, A Bear for Punishment (1951), parodies cultural values surrounding the celebration of Father's Day.

He is best known as the former host of BBC sports and current affairs shows including Grandstand, Nationwide and Breakfast Time, which he launched alongside Selina Scott and Nick Ross. Over a long broadcasting career, Bough became renowned for his smooth, relaxed and professional approach to live broadcasts, once being described as \\"the most unassailable performer on British television\\". In 1987, Michael Parkinson said: \\"If my life depended on the smooth handling of a TV show, Bough would be my first choice to be in charge.\\" In 1988, Bough was sacked by the BBC, following revelations that he had taken cocaine and visited brothels. He later presented programmes on LWT, ITV, Sky TV and on London's LBC radio before his retirement in 1998. Early life Bough was born in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He was educated at Oswestry Boys' High School (a Shropshire County Council secular grammar school after passing his eleven-plus exam), Oswestry, Shropshire, and at Merton College, Oxford. He played football for the university against Cambridge, and undertook his National service in the Royal Tank Regiment. Career =BBC= Bough joined the BBC as a presenter and reporter, presenting a new Newcastle upon Tyne-based show called Home at Six, soon renamed North at Six and then in 1963 becoming BBC Look North. Between 1964 and 1968, he was the presenter of Sportsview and in 1964 became the presenter of the BBC Sports Review of the Year, which he would host for 18 years. Between 1968 and 1983, he was a regular host for 15 years of the BBC's flagship Saturday afternoon sports programme Grandstand. Bough was one of the BBC's football commentators for the 1966 World Cup in England and covered the match at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough where North Korea defeated Italy 1‚Äì0, in a game regarded as one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. Bough went on to present the early evening magazine programme Nationwide. This made him one of the most familiar faces on British television throughout the 1970s. In 1977, Bough was memorably a guest on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas special, performing a song and dance routine in a sailor's outfit with film critic Barry Norman and rugby league commentator Eddie Waring. The programme's 21.3 million viewers remain a British record. Bough later said that he had to give Waring dancing lessons before the sketch, which was based on a comic version of the song There is Nothing Like a Dame from the musical South Pacific. Bough was the main presenter of the BBC's coverage of the 1978 World Cup finals in Argentina. His prominence increased in January 1983 when he became the first presenter of the BBC's inaugural breakfast television programme, Breakfast Time along with Selina Scott and Nick Ross. Bough was chosen by Ron Neil for his experience of presenting three hours of live television every week on Grandstand. As fellow presenter Nick Ross recounted: > None of us had remotely the experience of long, unscripted slabs of live TV > that Frank had from his sports broadcasting. He brought a sense of serenity > and reassurance. His unruffled composure made us feel this had all been done > before, and on the first morning, as the last minutes ticked down to our > opening transmission, when hearts were thumping and nerves were jangling, he > clapped his hands and‚Äîaddressing the producers and the technicians as much > as Selina and me‚Äîgently and firmly said, \\"Calm down.\\" We did.Jones, Ian > (2003). Morning Glory: A History of British Breakfast Television. Kelly > Publications. Bough left breakfast television at the end of 1987 to concentrate on the Holiday programme where, having been a roving holidaymaker, he took over as the main presenter when Cliff Michelmore left the series in 1986. =Sex and drugs scandal= In 1988, Bough was sacked by the BBC when he became mired in a sex and drugs scandal, which involved taking cocaine and wearing lingerie at sex parties.Platell, Amanda \\"Watching brief - Amanda Platell won't have Angus Deayton home\\", New Statesman, 28 October 2002, accessed 12 June 2008 \\"Frank Bough: I Took Drugs with Vice Girls\\" said the News of the Worlds front-page headline in 1988. The newspaper's former deputy editor Paul Connew later said of the scandal: \\"It caused a sensation at the time, given Bough's public image as the squeaky clean front man of breakfast and sports television.\\" Roy Greenslade, professor of journalism at City University London, said that Bough made a \\"terrible mistake\\" by agreeing to speak to newspapers prior to publication of personal allegations, worsening the story. In 1989, Bough was hired by LWT where he fronted Six O'Clock Live until it was axed in 1992, and in 1991 he presented ITV's coverage of that year's Rugby World Cup tournament. He also presented the Frank Bough Interview for Sky TV for two series. =Late career and retirement= In 1993, after his activities were regularly ridiculed in monologues on Have I Got News for You by Angus Deayton (who himself would be fired from the show following cocaine and prostitute use), Bough agreed to appear as a guest on the programme. In the early 1990s he was a presenter on London's LBC radio, staying on for the launch of London News Talk and moving to the News 97.3 service where he remained until 1996. He then presented Travel Live for the cable channel Travel. From 1994, he was a regular member of a Windsor-based choir, the Royal Free Singers. Bough had a liver transplant in 2001 after cancer was found, and now lives in retirement in Holyport, Berkshire. In 2009, he contributed to a programme looking back on Nationwide, broadcast on BBC Four. Personal life He married Nesta Howells after leaving the army in 1959. They have three sons: David, Stephen and Andrew. Bough met his wife while he was doing his national service. She stood by him during the scandals that marred his later career.

Childhood and early training He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was one of 11 children born to Peter Berend K√∏bke (1771-1843) and Cecilie Margrethe Petersen (1778-1867). In 1815 the family moved to Kastellet, a military fortification area in Copenhagen, where his father was head baker. At the age of 11 he suffered from a bout of rheumatic fever. He made many drawings during his convalescence and decided that he would become an artist. In 1822 at 12 years of age he started his studies at Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi). He studied first in the drawing class of Christian August Lorentzen (1749‚Äì1828) and finally 4 years under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg (1783‚Äì1853) after Lorentzen‚Äôs death in 1828. Eckersberg stressed observance of nature, and K√∏bke‚Äôs talent grew under Eckersberg‚Äôs disciplined training. Eckersberg‚Äôs influence is readily seen in K√∏bke‚Äôs first mature work \\"Parti af √Örhus Domkirke\\" painted in 1829. The painting was purchased by the Art Union (Kunstforening) and is now in the collection of the National Art Museum (Statens Museum for Kunst). He received the Academy‚Äôs small silver medallion in 1831 and a large silver medallion in 1833. Early career He lived in Kastellet until 1833 and made many paintings of the area. His painting \\"G√•rden ved bageriet i Kastellet\\" (ca. 1832) hangs in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen. In 1832 he shared a studio with his friend, landscape painter Frederik Hansen S√∏dring (1809‚Äì1862). He painted a portrait of S√∏dring which now hangs in the Hirschsprung Collection. In 1834 he moved, along with his parents, outside of Copenhagen‚Äôs fortifications near Sortedam Lake (Sortedamss√∏en). He painted many views overlooking the lake towards the city and the embankments surrounding the city. His work became larger, more monumental. Bay of Naples (1843) Like many of his contemporary artists he came under the influence of art historian Niels Lauritz H√∏yen (1798‚Äì1870), who promoted a nationalistic art. H√∏yen called for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other lands, such as Italy (which was at that time considered a requirement for an artist‚Äôs training). On a visit to Hiller√∏d in 1835 he painted a romantic picture of Frederiksborg Palace, Frederiksborg Slot ved Aftenbelysning (1835). At the end of 1837 he married Susanna Cecilie Krohn (1810‚Äì1849), and shortly afterwards painted a portrait of his young bride. Travel to Italy In 1838 he received a travel stipend from the Academy, left his new wife and traveled via Dresden and Munich to Italy accompanied by decorative painter Georg Hilker (1807‚Äì1875). They arrived in Rome by year‚Äôs end where he met his brother-in-law, sculptor and medallionist, Frederik Christopher Krohn (1806‚Äì1883) and many other Danish artists. He traveled, along with Constantin Hansen (1804‚Äì1880) the following summer to Naples, Sorrento, Pompeii and Capri where he painted out in the open air. Return to Denmark Havetrappen ved kunstnerens malestue p√• Blegdammen (c.1845), a depiction of the artist's studio in Copenhagen. He returned home in 1840 with a large collection of sketches for later use and inspiration. Unfortunately, most of his later work with these Italian themes was uninspired, and they found little favor. K√∏bke even considered at the time becoming a decorator, having participated in 1844-1845 in the decoration of the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, which is dedicated to the artistic works of neo-classicistical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770‚Äì1844). Two years after his father died in 1843, the family sold the property outside Copenhagen, and K√∏bke moved back into the city. His application for admission to the Academy, which was accompanied by one of his failed Italian landscapes, was rejected in 1846. He died in 1848 of pneumonia, and is buried in Assistens Kirkeg√•rd. Aftermath K√∏bke, a national romantic, painted portraits, landscapes and architectural paintings. Most of K√∏bke‚Äôs portraits show friends, family members and fellow artists. He found most of his motifs in his immediate surroundings. Now he is recognized internationally for his well composed and harmonic paintings, for their coloristic qualities and for his sense of the everyday life. But in his lifetime he was almost forgotten, especially because of his early death and limited production. Despite his talent and the praise of various contemporaries, K√∏bke had never been inundated with commissions. K√∏bke is recognized today as one of the most talented among Denmark‚Äôs Golden Age painters and the most internationally renowned Danish painter of his generation. The painterly interpretations he made of his surroundings stand as high points of the period. His works are in the collections of not only Danish museums but also such international museums as the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh.

A fluid containing the contents of lysed cells is called a lysate. In molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology laboratories, cell cultures may be subjected to lysis in the process of purifying their components, as in protein purification, DNA extraction, RNA extraction, or in purifying organelles. Many species of bacteria are subject to lysis by the enzyme lysozyme, found in animal saliva, egg white, and other secretions. Phage lytic enzymes (lysins) produced during bacteriophage infection are responsible for the ability of these viruses to lyse bacterial cells. Penicillin and related Œ≤-lactam antibiotics cause the death of bacteria through enzyme-mediated lysis that occurs after the drug causes the bacterium to form a defective cell wall. If the cell wall is completely lost and the penicillin was used on gram-positive bacteria, then the bacterium is referred to as a protoplast, but if penicillin was used on gram-negative bacteria, then it is called a spheroplast. Cytolysis Cytolysis occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to move into the cell. Cytolysis can be prevented by several different mechanisms, including the contractile vacuole that exists in some paramecia, which rapidly pump water out of the cell. Cytolysis does not occur under normal conditions in plant cells because plant cells have a strong cell wall that contains the osmotic pressure, or turgor pressure, that would otherwise cause cytolysis to occur. Oncolysis Oncolysis refers to the destruction of neoplastic cells or of a tumour. It is also used to refer to the reduction of any swelling. Plasmolysis Plasmolysis Plasmolysis is the contraction of cells within plants due to the loss of water through osmosis. In a hypertonic environment, the cell membrane peels off of the cell wall and the vacuole collapses. These cells will eventually wilt and die unless the flow of water caused by osmosis can stop the contraction of the cell membrane. Immune response Erythrocytes' hemoglobin release free radicals in response to pathogens when lysed by them. This can damage the pathogens.Red blood cells do more than just carry oxygen. New findings by NUS team show they aggressively attack bacteria too. , The Straits Times, 1 September 2007 Applications Cell lysis is used in laboratories to break open cells and purify or further study their contents. Lysis in the laboratory may be affected by enzymes or detergents or other chaotropic agents. Mechanical disruption of cell membranes, as by repeated freezing and thawing, sonication, pressure, or filtration may also be referred to as lysis. Many laboratory experiments are sensitive to the choice of lysis mechanism; often it is desirable to avoid mechanical shear forces that would denature or degrade sensitive macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA, and different types of detergents can yield different results. The unprocessed solution immediately after lysis but before any further extraction steps is often referred to as a crude lysate. For example, lysis is used in western and Southern blotting to analyze the composition of specific proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids individually or as complexes. Depending on the detergent used, either all or some membranes are lysed. For example, if only the cell membrane is lysed then gradient centrifugation can be used to collect certain organelles. Lysis is also used for protein purification, DNA extraction, and RNA extraction. Methods =Electrochemical Lysis= This method uses hydroxide ions which are created electrochemically within the device by a palladium electrode, porating the membrane of a cell causing cell lysis. The advantages of this method include selective lysing. =Chemical Lysis= This method uses chemical disruption. It is the most popular and simple approach. Chemical lysis chemically deteriorate/solubilize the proteins and lipids present within the membrane of targeted cells. =Acoustic Lysis= This method uses ultrasonic waves to generate areas of high and low pressure which causes cavitation and in turn, cell lysis. Though this method usually comes out clean, it fails to be cost effective and consistent. =Mechanical Lysis= This method uses physical penetration to pierce or cut a cell membrane.

Both X-Men refuse, however. He also tried to enlist Storm as a member, but she also refused.X-Men Annual No. 3 (1994). Marvel Comics. Shaw was a member of the Upstarts, a group made up of Siena Blaze, Graydon Creed, Fabian Cortez, Trevor Fitzroy and probationary members Andreas and Andrea Strucker (of Fenris). They were manipulated by the Gamemaster and originally Selene, but the group quickly turns against her. The group participates in an elaborate game, wherein they hunt and kill assigned targets for points. During one of these games, the Upstarts target the surviving members of the New Mutants and the Hellions, but are defeated by the combined forces of X-Force and the New Warriors. Later, Sebastian resurfaces alive and well and is able to take control of the Hellfire Club from his son. Shaw then worked with Spiral and Mindmeld as they experiment on Karma's siblings. However, his personal assassin Clear-Cut betrays Shaw and aids X-Force in defeating him. Shaw is confirmed as being one of a handful of mutants who retained their powers following the 2005 \\"Decimation\\" storyline.X-Men: 198 Files. Marvel Comics Sometime after that Shaw is killed by his father, and then resurrected by Selene. He is then sent with Harry Leland to kill his father and Donald Pierce.X-Necrosha No. 1. Marvel Comics. His ultimate fate is uncertain, as it is unknown if he was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as a sacrifice to Selene or if he was among the mutants that managed to escape Utopia. Shaw is revealed to be alive and his team of Upstarts kill the Nasty Boys, but are neutralized by the X-Men. Shaw mysteriously committed suicide by putting his hand into his brain before muttering that Emma Frost will not get him (as she had been manipulating the X-Men).Uncanny X-men Vol. 5 #20 In the 2019 relaunch of the X-Men comics, Shinobi was resurrected on Krakoa by The Five and placed under the care of his father, who appointed him the Black Bishop of the Hellfire Trading Company. Shinobi was unaware of the circumstances of his death, and his father told him that Emma Frost and Kate Pryde conspired to kill him. Marauders, Issue 3  Powers and abilities  Shinobi Shaw is a mutant who can alter his body's density from diamond-hard to intangible. He usually uses it as a means of escape, but he can also use the intangibility to reach into an opponent's heart and induce a heart attack, without any adverse effects on Shaw himself.  Other versions  Shinobi Shaw appeared in the Ultimate X-Men title, as Emma Frost's boyfriend. He is a member of the Academy of Tomorrow, in addition to the Hellfire Club. One of his operatives, Gerald Levine, is currently spying on the Xavier Institute and Marvel Girl, under his orders. When visiting the school, Shinobi and Gerald attacked Jean in an attempt to capture the Phoenix God. This failed, as the Phoenix fought back, and both Shinobi & Gerald were taken into police custody. Later, it is revealed that Emma's also a member of the Hellfire Club in secret.Ultimate X-Men No. 81. Marvel Comics. Later in the Ultimate Comics: Ultimates, Tony Stark and Jarvis are seen leaving a party for Shaw in Tokyo to respond to an emergency by Nick Fury.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates No. 1. Marvel Comics.

This is called homologous recombination and creates an Hfr (high frequency of recombination) cell. 2.The Hfr cell forms sex pilli a pilus and attaches to a recipient F- cell. 3.A nick in one strand of the Hfr cell‚Äôs chromosome is created. 4.DNA begins to be transferred from the Hfr cell to the recipient cell while the second strand of its chromosome is being replicated. 5.The pilus detaches from the recipient cell and retracts. The Hfr cell ideally wants to transfer its entire genome to the recipient cell. However, due to its large size and inability to keep in contact with the recipient cell, it is not able to do so. 6.The F- cell remains F- because the entire F factor sequence was not received. Since no homologous recombination occurred, the DNA that was transferred is degraded by enzymes. In very rare cases, the F factor will be completely transferred and the F- cell will become an Hfr cell. A high- frequency recombination cell (Hfr cell) (also called an Hfr strain) is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid (for example, the F-factor) integrated into its chromosomal DNA. The integration of the plasmid into the cell's chromosome is through homologous recombination. A conjugative plasmid capable of chromosome integration is also called an episome (a segment of DNA that can exist as a plasmid or become integrated into the chromosome). When conjugation occurs, Hfr cells are very efficient in delivering chromosomal genes of the cell into recipient F‚àí cells, which lack the episome. History The Hfr strain was first characterized by Luca Cavalli-Sforza. William Hayes also isolated another Hfr strain independently.  Transfer of bacterial chromosome by Hfr cells  An Hfr cell can transfer a portion of the bacterial genome. Despite being integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the bacteria, the F factor of Hfr cells can still initiate conjugative transfer, without being excised from the bacterial chromosome first. Due to the F factor's inherent tendency to transfer itself during conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it. Therefore, unlike a normal F+ cell, Hfr strains will attempt to transfer their entire DNA through the mating bridge, in a fashion similar to the normal conjugation. In a typical conjugation, the recipient cell also becomes F+ after conjugation as it receives an entire copy of the F factor plasmid; but this is not the case in conjugation mediated by Hfr cells. Due to the large size of bacterial chromosome, it is very rare for the entire chromosome to be transferred into the F ‚àí cell as time required is simply too long for the cells to maintain their physical contact. Therefore, as the conjugative transfer is not complete (the circular nature of plasmid and bacterial chromosome requires complete transfer for the F factor to be transferred as it may be cut in the middle), the recipient F‚àí cells do not receive the complete F factor sequence, and do not become F + due to its inability to form a sex pilus.  Interrupted mating technique  In conjugation mediated by Hfr cells, transfer of DNA starts at the origin of transfer (oriT) located within the F factor and then continues clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the orientation of F factor in the chromosome. Therefore, the length of chromosomal DNA transferred into the F‚àí cell is proportional to the time that conjugation is allowed to happen. This results in sequential transfer of genes on the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial geneticists make use of this principle to map the genes on the bacterial chromosome. This technique is called interrupted mating as geneticists allow conjugation to take place for different periods of time before stopping conjugation with a high-speed blender. By using Hfr and F‚àí strains with one strain carrying mutations in several genes, each affecting a metabolic function or causing antibiotic resistance, and examining the phenotype of the recipient cells on selective agar plates, one can deduce which genes are transferred into the recipient cells first and therefore are closer to the oriT sequence on the chromosome.  The F-prime cell  F-prime cell contains F-plasmid that integrates with the chromosomal DNA and carries part of the chromosomal DNA along with it while being excised from the chromosome. Thus F-prime plasmid is the plasmid, containing part of the chromosomal DNA which can be transferred to recipient cell, along with the plasmid during conjugation.

He later rejected the search for a Jewish homeland in Palestine and became the prime thinker behind the territorial movement. Early life and education Zangwill was born in London on 21 January 1864, in a family of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His father, Moses Zangwill, was from what is now Latvia, and his mother, Ellen Hannah Marks Zangwill, was from what is now Poland. He dedicated his life to championing the cause of people he considered oppressed, becoming involved with topics such as Jewish emancipation, Jewish assimilation, territorialism, Zionism, and women's suffrage. His brother was novelist Louis Zangwill.Louis Zangwill in Jewish Encyclopedia Zangwill received his early schooling in Plymouth and Bristol. When he was nine years old, Zangwill was enrolled in the Jews' Free School in Spitalfields in east London, a school for Jewish immigrant children. The school offered a strict course of both secular and religious studies while supplying clothing, food, and health care for the scholars; presently one of its four houses is named Zangwill in his honour. At this school he excelled and even taught part-time, eventually becoming a full-fledged teacher. While teaching, he studied for his degree from the University of London, earning a BA with triple honours in 1884. Career Time cover, 17 Sep 1923 =Writings= Zangwill published some of his works under the pen-names J. Freeman Bell (for works written in collaboration), Countess von S., and Marshallik. He had already written a tale entitled The Premier and the Painter in collaboration with Louis Cowen, when he resigned his position as a teacher owing to differences with the school managers and ventured into journalism. He initiated and edited Ariel, The London Puck, and did miscellaneous work for the London press. The Melting Pot (1916). Zangwill's work earned him the nickname \\"the Dickens of the Ghetto\\".Israel Zangwill ‚Äì A Sketch, by Emanuel Elzas; in the San Francisco Call; published 25 August 1895; retrieved 14 May 2013; archived at the Library of Congress He wrote a very influential novel Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (1892), which the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing called \\"a powerful book\\".Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.364. The use of the metaphorical phrase \\"melting pot\\" to describe American absorption of immigrants was popularised by Zangwill's play The Melting Pot,Werner Sollers, Beyond Ethnicity: Consent and Descent in American Culture (1986), Chapter 3 \\"Melting Pots\\" a success in the United States in 1909‚Äì10. When The Melting Pot opened in Washington D.C. on 5 October 1909, former President Theodore Roosevelt leaned over the edge of his box and shouted, \\"That's a great play, Mr. Zangwill, that's a great play.\\"Guy Szuberla, \\"Zangwill's The Melting Pot Plays Chicago,\\" MELUS, Vol. 20, No. 3, History and Memory. (Autumn, 1995), pp. 3‚Äì20. In 1912, Zangwill received a letter from Roosevelt in which Roosevelt wrote of the Melting Pot \\"That particular play I shall always count among the very strong and real influences upon my thought and my life.\\"This passage is quoted on page 131 of \\"Theodore Roosevelt and the Idea of Race\\" by Thomas G. Dyer 1980 Louisiana State University Press (Paperback edition 1992). A footnote shows the letter to have been written on 27 November 1912. This letter is held in the Roosevelt Collection, Library of Congress. The protagonist of the play, David, emigrates to America after the Kishinev pogrom in which his entire family is killed. He writes a great symphony named \\"The Crucible\\" expressing his hope for a world in which all ethnicity has melted away, and becomes enamored of a beautiful Russian Christian immigrant named Vera. The dramatic climax of the play is the moment when David meets Vera's father, who turns out to be the Russian officer responsible for the annihilation of David's family. Vera's father admits guilt, the symphony is performed to accolades, David and Vera live happily ever after, or, at least, agree to wed and kiss as the curtain falls. \\"Melting Pot celebrated America's capacity to absorb and grow from the contributions of its immigrants.\\"Kraus, Joe, \\"How The Melting Pot Stirred America: The Reception of Zangwill's Play and Theater's Role in the American Assimilation Experience,\\" MELUS, Vol. 24, No. 3, Varieties of Ethnic Criticism.

His real hope was for a world in which the entire lexicon of racial and religious difference is thrown away.\\"Jonathan Sacks The Home We build Together, Continium Books, 2007, P. 26 Zangwill wrote many other plays, including, on Broadway, Children of the Ghetto (1899), a dramatisation of his own novel, directed by James A. Herne and starring Blanche Bates, Ada Dwyer, and Wilton Lackaye; Merely Mary Ann (1903) and Nurse Marjorie (1906), both of which were directed by Charles Cartwright and starred Eleanor Robson. Liebler & Co. produced all three plays as well as The Melting Pot. Daniel Frohman produced Zangwill's 1904 play, The Serio-Comic Governess, featuring Cecilia Loftus, Kate Pattison-Selten, and Julia Dean.Burns Mantle and Garrison P. Sherwood, eds., The Best Plays of 1899‚Äì1909, pp. 351, 449, 465‚Äì466, 521‚Äì522. In 1931 Jules Furthman adapted Merely Mary Ann for a Janet Gaynor film. Zangwill's simulation of Yiddish sentence structure in English aroused great interest. He also wrote mystery works, such as The Big Bow Mystery (1892), and social satire such as The King of Schnorrers (1894), a picaresque novel (which became a short-lived musical comedy in 1979). His Dreamers of the Ghetto (1898) includes essays on famous Jews such as Baruch Spinoza, Heinrich Heine and Ferdinand Lassalle. The Big Bow Mystery was the first locked room mystery novel. It has been almost continuously in print since 1891 and has been used as the basis for three commercial movies. Another much produced play was The Lens Grinder, based on the life of Spinoza.

June 1905 Zangwill endorsed feminism and pacifism, but his greatest effect may have been as a writer who popularised the idea of the combination of ethnicities into a single, American nation. The hero of his widely produced play, The Melting Pot, proclaims: \\"America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reforming...

After having for a time endorsed Theodor Herzl, including presiding over a meeting at the Maccabean Club, London, addressed by Herzl on 24 November 1895, and endorsing the main Palestine-oriented Zionist movement, Zangwill quit the established philosophy and founded his own organisation, named the Jewish Territorialist Organization in 1905, advocating a Jewish homeland in whatever land might be available Israel Zangwill, Joseph Leftwich, Yoseloff, 1957, p. 219 in the world which could be found for them, with speculations including Canada, Australia, Mesopotamia, Uganda and Cyrenaica. \\"At the centennial of his birth, even some of those who recognized the continuing relevance of his efforts to define the Jew in the modern world separated the compelling nature of his struggle from the Victorianness of his writing and the insufficiency of his solutions: territorialism, universal religion, assimilation into an American 'melting pot.' As John Gross wrote in Commentary Magazine 'one honours the writer, and puts aside his books'.\\" Zangwill is inaccurately known for creating the slogan \\"A land without a people for a people without a land\\" describing Zionist aspirations in the Biblical land of Israel. He did not invent the phrase; he acknowledged borrowing it from Lord Shaftesbury.Garfinkle, Adam M., \\"On the Origin, Meaning, Use and Abuse of a Phrase.\\" Middle Eastern Studies, London, October 1991, vol. 27 In 1853, during the preparation for the Crimean War, Shaftesbury wrote to Foreign Minister Aberdeen that Greater Syria was \\"a country without a nation\\" in need of \\"a nation without a country... Is there such a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!\\" In his diary that year he wrote \\"these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion.

On Herzl's visits to London, they co-operated closely.Vital, 442 In a debate at the Article Club in November 1901 Zangwill was still misreading the situation: \\"Palestine has but a small population of Arabs and fellahin and wandering, lawless, blackmailing Bedouin tribes.\\"Israel Zangwill, The Commercial Future of Palestine, Debate at the Article Club, 20 November 1901.

We can sweep away the blackmailer‚Äîbe he Pasha or Bedouin‚Äîwe can make the wilderness blossom as the rose, and build up in the heart of the world a civilisation that may be a mediator and interpreter between the East and the West.\\" In 1902, Zangwill wrote that Palestine \\"remains at this moment an almost uninhabited, forsaken and ruined Turkish territory\\". However, within a few years, Zangwill had \\"become fully aware of the Arab peril\\", telling an audience in New York, \\"Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is already twice as thickly populated as the United States\\" leaving Zionists the choice of driving the Arabs out or dealing with a \\"large alien population\\".I.

Faris, Israel Zangwill's challenge to Zionism, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1975), pp. 74‚Äì90 In 1908, Zangwill told a London court that he had been naive when he made his 1901 speech and had since \\"realized what is the density of the Arab population\\", namely twice that of the United States. In 1913 he criticised those who insisted on repeating that Palestine was \\"empty and derelict\\" and who called him a traitor for reporting otherwise.Simon (1937), pp. 313‚Äì314. He continued, \\"Well, consistency may be a political virtue, but I see no virtue in consistent lying.\\" According to Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Zangwill told him in 1916 that, \\"If you wish to give a country to a people without a country, it is utter foolishness to allow it to be the country of two peoples. This can only cause trouble. The Jews will suffer and so will their neighbours. One of the two: a different place must be found either for the Jews or for their neighbours\\".Cited in Yosef Gorny, Zionism and the Arabs, 1882‚Äì1948 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), p. 271 In 1917, he wrote \\"'Give the country without a people,' magnanimously pleaded Lord Shaftesbury, 'to the people without a country.' Alas, it was a misleading mistake. The country holds 600,000 Arabs.\\"I. Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, MacMillan, 1921, p. 96 In 1921, Zangwill suggested Lord Shaftesbury \\"was literally inexact in describing Palestine as a country without a people, he was essentially correct, for there is no Arab people living in intimate fusion with the country, utilizing its resources and stamping it with a characteristic impress: there is at best an Arab encampment, the break-up of which would throw upon the Jews the actual manual labor of regeneration and prevent them from exploiting the fellahin, whose numbers and lower wages are moreover a considerable obstacle to the proposed immigration from Poland and other suffering centers\\".Zangwill, Israel, The Voice of Jerusalem, Macmillan, New York, 1921, p. 109 Zangwill died in 1926 in Midhurst, West Sussex. Personal life Far End, East Preston, West Sussex Zangwill married Edith Ayrton, a feminist and author who was the daughter of cousins William Edward Ayrton and Matilda Chaplin Ayrton.

Early life and writings  Weiner was born in Providence, Rhode Island and attended Classical High School, until 1946, and then Radcliffe College. She graduated with a B.A. in 1950, with a dissertation on Graham Greene. Working in publishing and then in Bloomingdale's department store, she was married and then divorced after four years. Weiner started writing poetry in 1963 though her first chapbook, The Magritte Poems after Ren√© Magritte, was published in 1970. It is not indicative of her latter work, being \\"basically a New York School attempt to write verse in response to the paintings of Ren√© Magritte\\". During the 1960s she also organized and participated in a number of happenings with other members of the New York City art scene, where she had been living for some time. These included 'Hannah Weiner at Her Job', \\"a sort of open house hosted by her employer, A.H. Schreiber Co., Inc.\\" and 'Fashion Show Poetry Event' with Eduardo Costa, John Perreault, Andy Warhol and others in a \\"collaborative and innovative enterprise that incorporated conceptual art, design, poetry and performance.\\"  Mature work  In the early 1970s, Weiner began writing a series of journals that were partly the result of her experiments with automatic writing and partly a result of her schizophrenia. Judith Goldman claims that politics and ethics were central to a mode of writing she developed and called \\"clair-style,\\" which used \\"words and phrases clairvoyantly seen\\" and that Weiner arrived at a method of composing that employed \\"these seen elements exclusively.\\" Goldman also provides the insight that \\"Weiner let no representation of herself circulate that did not take her status as a clairvoyant into account.\\" She influenced a number of the language poets and was included in the In the American Tree anthology of Language poetry (edited by Ron Silliman). Beginning with Little Books/Indians (1980) and Spoke (1984) Weiner's work engaged with Native American politics, particularly the American Indian Movement and the case of imprisoned activist Leonard Peltier.

The team, a Class A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians, plays in the Midwest League. The Captains joined the Midwest League following the 2009 season in a shuffle caused by the Columbus Catfish's move to Bowling Green, Kentucky for the 2009 season. The move alleviated travel costs and time, as it was the South Atlantic League's northernmost team. The nearest team (the West Virginia Power in Charleston) is a drive from Eastlake. Prior to the 2003 season, the club was based in Columbus, Georgia and known as the Columbus RedStixx. The Captains play their home games in Classic Park, which has a capacity of 6,157 and opened in 2003 as Eastlake Stadium. The current stadium name is the result of a naming rights arrangement; the sponsor is Classic Automotive Group, a major area chain of auto dealerships. Classic Park hosted the South Atlantic League All-Star Game on June 20, 2006.

They seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights. Hamlets preferentially mate with individuals of their same color pattern.

Israel spent 4.3% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on civil research and development in 2015, the highest ratio in the world. In 2019, Israel was ranked the world's fifth most innovative country by the Bloomberg Innovation Index. It ranks thirteenth in the world for scientific output as measured by the number of scientific publications per million citizens. In 2014, Israel's share of scientific articles published worldwide (0.9%) was much higher than its share of the global population (0.1%). It also has one of the highest per capita rates of filed patents. Israel counts 140 scientists and technicians per 10,000 employees, one of the highest ratios in the world. In comparison, there are 85 per 10,000 in the United States and 83 per 10,000 in Japan. In 2012, Israel counted 8,337 full- time equivalent researchers per million inhabitants. This compares with 3,984 in the US, 6,533 in the Republic of South Korea and 5,195 in Japan. Israel's high technology industry has benefited from both the country's highly educated and technologically skilled workforce coupled with the strong presence of foreign high-tech firms and sophisticated research centres. Israel is home to major players in the high-tech industry and has one of the world's most technologically literate populations. In 1998, Tel Aviv was named by Newsweek as one of the ten most technologically influential cities in the world. Since 2000, Israel has been a member of EUREKA, the pan-European research and development funding and coordination organization, and held the rotating chairmanship of the organization for 2010‚Äì2011. In 2010, American journalist David Kaufman wrote that the high tech area of Yokneam, Israel, has the \\"world's largest concentration of aesthetics-technology companies\\". Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has complimented the country during a visit there, saying that ‚ÄúIsrael has the most important high-tech center in the world after the US.‚Äù  History  Jewish settlement in Mandate Palestine was motivated by both ideology and flight from persecution. Return to the homeland was an important aspect of Jewish immigration and was perceived by many as a return to the soil. To establish the rural villages that formed the core of Zionist ideology and produce self-supporting Jewish farmers, agronomic experiments were conducted.The Land that Became Israel: Studies in Historical Geography, edited by Ruth Kark, Yale University Press & Magnes Press, 1989, \\"Traditional and modern rural settlement types in Eretz-Israel in the modern era,\\" Yossi Ben Artzi, pp. 141‚Äì144. The foundations of agricultural research in Israel were laid by the teachers and graduates of the Mikveh Yisrael School, the country's first agricultural school, established by the Alliance Israelite Universelle in 1870.Rothschild and Early Jewish Colonization in Palestine, Ran Aaronsohn, Rowman & Littlefield, Magnes Press, 2000, pp.134‚Äì145. On a field trip to Mount Hermon in 1906, the agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn discovered Triticum dicoccoides, or emmer wheat, believed to be the \\"mother of all wheat.\\" In 1909, he founded an agricultural research station in Atlit where he built up an extensive library and collected geological and botanical samples. The Agricultural Station, founded in Rehovot in 1921, engaged in soil research and other aspects of farming in the country's difficult climatic conditions. This station, which became the Agricultural Research Organization (ARO), is now Israel's major institution of agricultural research and development. Albert Einstein at the Technion; c. 1925 In 1912, the first cornerstone of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology was laid at a festive ceremony in Haifa, which was then occupied by the Ottoman Empire. The Technion would become a unique university worldwide in its claim to precede and create a nation. As Jews were often barred from technical education in Europe, the Technion claims to have brought the skills needed to build a modern state. Established before World War I, the Hebrew Health Station in Jerusalem, founded by Nathan Straus engaged in medical and public health research, operating departments for public hygiene, eye diseases and bacteriology. The station manufactured vaccines against typhus and cholera, and developed methods of pest control to eliminate field mice. The Pasteur Institute affiliated with the station developed a rabies vaccine. Departments for microbiology, biochemistry, bacteriology, and hygiene were opened at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, founded on Mount Scopus in 1925. In 1936, Jewish workers in the center of the country donated two-days' pay toward the establishment of the \\"Hospital of Judea and Sharon,\\" later renamed Beilinson Hospital. In 1938, Beilinson established the country's first blood bank. The Rothschild-Hadassah University Hospital on Mount Scopus opened in 1939 and was the first teaching hospital and medical center in the country. Since renamed the Hadassah Medical Center, it has become a leader in medical research. WEIZAC, the first modern computer in the Middle East Industrial research began at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, was also initiated at the Daniel Sieff Research Center (later the Weizmann Institute of Science), established in 1934 in Rehovot. The Dead Sea Laboratories opened in the 1930s. The first modern electronic computer in Israel and the Middle East, and one of the first large-scale, stored-program, electronic computers in the world, called WEIZAC, was built at the Weizmann Institute during 1954‚Äì1955, based on the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) architecture developed by John von Neumann. WEIZAC has been recognized by the IEEE as a milestone in the history of electrical engineering and computing.Bogdanowicz, Anna (5 December 2006) Middle East's First Computer Named History Milestone. IEEE. Retrieved 2010-03-25 IBM Israel, registered on June 8, 1950, was the country's first high-tech firm. The company, located on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, assembled and repaired punch card machines, sorting machines and tabulators. In 1956, a local plant was opened to produce punch cards, and a year later, the first service center opened, offering computerized data processing services. Scientific and technological research in Israel was boosted by the appointment of a chief scientist for the Industry and Trade Ministry at the recommendation of a committee headed by Ephraim Katzir, later president of Israel. The Israeli government provided grants that covered 50‚Äì80 percent of the outlay for new start-ups, with no conditions, no shareholding and no participation in management. In the early 1980s, Control Data Corporation, a partner in Elron Electronic Industries, formed the country's first venture capital firm. = Origin of Israeli high-tech industry = Israel's high-tech industries are a spin-off of the rapid development of computer science and technology in the 1980s in such places as Silicon Valley and Massachusetts Route 128 in the US, which ushered in the current high-tech era. Up until that point, Israel's economy had been essentially based on agriculture, mining and secondary sectors such as diamond polishing and manufacturing in textiles, fertilizers and plastics. The key factor which enabled high-tech industries based on information and communication technologies to take root and flourish in Israel was investment by the defense and aerospace industries, which spawned new technologies and know-how. Israel devoted 17.1% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988. Even though this share had dropped to 5.8% of GDP by 2016, Israel military spending remains among the highest in the world. For the purposes of comparison, the United States devoted 5.7% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988 and 3.3% in 2016. This heavy investment in defence and aerospace formed the basis for Israel's high-tech industries in medical devices, electronics, telecommunications, computer software and hardware. The massive Russian immigration of the 1990s reinforced this phenomenon, doubling the number of engineers and scientists in Israel overnight. Between 1989 and 2006, about 979 000 Russian Jews and their relatives migrated to Israel, which had a population of just 4.5 million in 1989. The purchase of Mirabilis in 1998 was the first big exit of high tech in Israel and caused rush of Israeli companies as part of Dot-com bubble. Today, Israel has the world's most research-intensive business sector; in 2013, it alone performed 3.49% of GDP. Competitive grants and tax incentives are the two main policy instruments supporting business research and development. Thanks to government incentives and the availability of highly trained human capital, Israel has become an attractive location for the research centres of leading multinationals. The country's national innovation ecosystem relies on both foreign multinationals and large corporate investors in research and development, as well as on start-ups. According to the Israel Venture Capital Database, 264 foreign research centres are currently active in Israel. Many of these centres are owned by large multinational firms that have acquired Israeli companies, technology and know-how and transformed them through mergers and acquisitions into their own local research facilities. The activity of some research centres even spans more than three decades, such as those of Intel, Applied Materials, Motorola and IBM. In 2011, foreign research centres employed 33,700 workers through local subsidiaries, two-thirds of whom (23,700) worked in research and development. The same year, these research centres spent a total of NIS 14.17 billion on research and development across the full spectrum of industry, up from 17% over the previous year.  Higher education policy  = Sixth Higher Education Plan = Israel's higher education system is regulated by the Council for Higher Education and its Planning and Budgeting Committee. The Israeli higher education system operates under a multi-year plan agreed upon by the Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance. Each plan determines policy objectives and, accordingly, the budgets to be allocated in order to achieve these objectives. The annual government allocation to universities totalled about US$1 750 million in 2015, providing 50‚Äì75% of their operating budgets. Much of the remainder of their operating budget (15‚Äì20%) comes from annual student tuition fees, which are uniform at about US$2 750 per year. The Sixth Higher Education Plan (2011‚Äì2016) makes provision for a 30% rise in the Council for Higher Education's budget. The Sixth Plan changes the budgeting model of the PBC by placing greater emphasis on excellence in research, along with quantitative measures for the number of students. Under this model, 75% of the committee's budget (NIS 7 billion over six years) is being allocated to institutions offering higher education. The Sixth Higher Education Plan launched the Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme in October 2011. This reflects a renewed interest in funding academic research and constitutes a strong indication of a reversal in government policy. = Israeli Centres of Research Excellence = The Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme, which dates from 2011, envisions the establishment of cross- institutional clusters of top researchers in specific fields and returning young Israeli scientists from abroad, with each centre being endowed with state-of-the-art research infrastructure. The Sixth Higher Education Plan invests NIS 300 million over six years in upgrading and renovating academic infrastructure and research facilities. I-CORE is run jointly by the Council for Higher Education's Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation. By 2015, 16 centres had been established in two waves across a wide spectrum of research areas: six specialize in life sciences and medicine, five in the exact sciences and engineering, three in social sciences and law and two in humanities. Each centre of excellence has been selected via a peer review process conducted by the Israel Science Foundation. By May 2014, around 60 young researchers had been absorbed into these centres, many of whom had previously worked abroad. The research topics of each centre are selected through a broad bottom-up process consisting of consultations with the Israeli academic community, in order to ensure that they reflect the genuine priorities and scientific interests of Israeli researchers. I-CORE is funded by the Council for Higher Education, the host institutions and strategic business partners, with a total budget of NIS 1.35 billion (US$365 million). The original goal was to set up 30 centres of research excellence in Israel by 2016. However, the establishment of the remaining 14 centres has provisionally been shelved, for lack of sufficient external capital. In 2013‚Äì2014, the Planning and Budgeting Committee's budget for the entire I-CORE programme amounted to NIS 87.9 million, equivalent to about 1% of the total for higher education that year. This budget appears to be insufficient to create the critical mass of researchers in various academic fields and thus falls short of the programme's objective. The level of government support for the centres of excellence has grown each year since 2011 as new centres have been established and is expected to reach NIS 93.6 million by 2015‚Äì2016 before dropping to 33.7 million in 2017‚Äì2018. According to the funding model, government support should represent one-third ofall funding, another third being funded by the participating universities and the remaining third by donors or investors. = University recruitment targets = In the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year, there were 4,066 faculty members. The targets fixed by the Planning and Budgeting Committee for faculty recruitment are ambitious: universities are to recruit another 1 600 senior faculty within the six-year period ‚Äì about half of whom will occupy new positions and half will replace faculty expected to retire. This will constitute a net increase of more than 15% in university faculty. In colleges, another 400 new positions are to be created, entailing a 25% net increase. The new faculty will be hired via the institutions‚Äô regular recruitment channels, some in specific research areas, through the Israeli Centers of Research Excellence program. The increase in faculty numbers will also reduce the student-to-faculty ratio, the target being to achieve a ratio of 21.5 university students to every faculty member, compared to 24.3 at present, and 35 students for every faculty member in colleges, compared to 38 at present. This increase in the number of faculty positions, alongside the upgrading of research and teaching infrastructure and the increase in competitive research funds, should help Israel to staunch brain drain by enabling the best Israeli researchers at home and abroad to conduct their academic work in Israel, if they so wish, at institutions offering the highest academic standards. The new budgeting scheme described above is mainly concerned with the human and research infrastructure in universities. Most of the physical development (e.g. buildings) and scientific infrastructure (e.g. laboratories and expensive equipment) of universities comes from philanthropic donations, primarily from the American Jewish community (CHE, 2014). This latter source of funding has greatly compensated for the lack of sufficient government funding for universities up until now but it is expected to diminish significantly in the years to come. Unless the government invests more in research infrastructure, Israel's universities will be ill-equipped and insufficiently funded to meet the challenges of the 21st century. = Expanding access to higher education = Israel has offered virtually universal access to its universities and academic colleges since the wave of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s prompted the establishment of numerous tertiary institutions to absorb the additional demand. However, the Arab and ultra-orthodox minorities still attend university in insufficient numbers. The Sixth Higher Education Plan places emphasis on encouraging minority groups to enroll in higher education. Two years after the Mahar program was implemented in late 2012 for the ultra- orthodox population, student enrollment had grown by 1400. Twelve new programs for ultra-orthodox students have since been established, three of them on university campuses. Meanwhile, the Pluralism and Equal Opportunity in Higher Education program addresses the barriers to integration of the Arab minority in the higher education system. Its scope ranges from providing secondary- school guidance through preparation for academic studies to offering students comprehensive support in their first year of study, a stage normally characterized by a high drop-out rate. The program renews the Ma‚Äôof fund supporting outstanding young Arab faculty members. Since the introduction of this program in 1995, the Ma‚Äôof fund has opened tenure track opportunities for nearly 100 Arab lecturers, who act as role models for younger Arab students embarking on their own academic careers.  Science, technology and innovation policy  = Policy framework = Although Israel does not have an ‚Äòumbrella type‚Äô policy for science, technology and innovation optimizing priorities and allocating resources, it does implement, de facto, an undeclared set of best practices combining bottom-up and top-down processes via government offices, such as those of the Chief Scientist or the Minister of Science, Technology and Space, as well as ad hoc organizations like the Telem forum. The procedure for selecting research projects for the Israeli centers for research excellence is one example of this bottom-up process. Israel has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry. Nevertheless, the Israeli government influences policy formulation by universities and technology transfer by providing incentives and subsidies through programmes such as Magnet and Magneton, as well as through regulation. There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy. The Israeli economy is driven by industries based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country's defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines are rooted in the basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a dilemma. In the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, it is not clear how these institutions will manage to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries. = Evaluation of science policy instruments = The country's various policy instruments are evaluated by the Council for Higher Education, the National Council for Research and Development, the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the Magnet administration in the Office of the Chief Scientist has initiated several evaluations of its own policy instruments, most of which have been carried out by independent research institutions. One such evaluation was carried out in 2010 by the Samuel Neaman Institute; it concerned the Nofar programme within the Magnet directorate. Nofar tries to bridge basic and applied research, before the commercial potential of a project has caught the eye of industry. The main recommendation was for Nofar to extend programme funding to emerging technological domains beyond biotechnology and nanotechnology. The Office of the Chief Scientist accepted this recommendation and, consequently, decided to fund projects in the fields of medical devices, water and energy technology and multidisciplinary research. An additional evaluation was carried out in 2008 by Applied Economics, an economic and management research-based consultancy, on the contribution of the high-tech sector to economic productivity in Israel. It found that the output per worker in companies that received support from the Office of the Chief Scientist was 19% higher than in ‚Äòtwin‚Äô companies that had not received this support. The same year, a committee headed by Israel Makov examined the Office of the Chief Scientist's support for research and development in large companies. The committee found economic justification for providing incentives for these companies. = Research funding programmes = The Israeli Science Foundation is the main source of research funding in Israel and receives administrative support from the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The foundation provides competitive grants in three areas: exact sciences and technology; life sciences and medicine; and humanities and social sciences. Complementary funding is provided by binational foundations, such as the USA‚ÄìIsrael Binational Science Foundation (est. 1972) and the German‚ÄìIsraeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (est. 1986). The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space funds thematic research centres and is responsible for international scientific co-operation. The Ministry's National Infrastructure Programme aims to create a critical mass of knowledge in national priority fields and to nurture the younger generation of scientists. Investment in the programme mainly takes the form of research grants, scholarships and knowledge centres. Over 80% of the ministry's budget is channelled towards research in academic institutions and research institutes, as well as towards revamping scientific infrastructure by upgrading existing research facilities and establishing new ones. In 2012, the ministry resolved to invest NIS 120 million over three years in four designated priority areas for research: brain science; supercomputing and cybersecurity; oceanography; and alternative transportation fuels. An expert panel headed by the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space chose these four broad disciplines in the belief that they would be likely to exert the greatest practical impact on Israeli life in the near future. The main ongoing programmes managed by the Office of the Chief Scientist within the Ministry of the Economy are: the Research and Development Fund; Magnet Tracks (est. 1994; Tnufa (est. 2001) and the Incubator Programme (est.1991). Between 2010 and 2014, the Office of the Chief Scientist initiated several new programmes: * Grand Challenges Israel (since 2014): an Israeli contribution to the Grand Challenges in Global Health programme, which is dedicated to tackling global health and food security challenges in developing countries; Grand Challenges Israel is offering grants of up to NIS 500 000 at the proof of concept/feasibility study stage. * Research and development in the field of space technology (2012): encourages research to find technological solutions in various fields. * Technological Entrepreneurship Incubators (2014): encourages entrepreneurial technology and supports start-up technology companies. * Magnet ‚Äì Kamin programme (2014) provides direct support for applied research in academia that has potential for commercial application. * Cyber ‚Äì Kidma programme (2014): promotes Israel's cybersecurity industry. * Cleantech ‚Äì Renewable Energy Technology Centre (2012): supports research through projects involving private‚Äìpublic partnerships in the field of renewable energy. * Life Sciences Fund (2010): finances the projects of Israeli companies, with emphasis on biopharmaceuticals, established together with the Ministry of Finance and the private sector. * Biotechnology ‚Äì Tzatam programme (2011): provides equipment to support research and development in life sciences. The Chief Scientist supports industrial organizations and the PBC provides research institutions with assistance. * Investment in high-tech industries (2011): encourages financial institutions to invest in knowledge- based industries, through a collaboration between the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Ministry of Finance. Another source of public research funding is the Forum for National Research and Development Infrastructure (Telem). This voluntary partnership involves the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Ministry of Finance. Telem projects focus on establishing infrastructure for research and development in areas that are of common interest to most Telem partners. These projects are financed by the Telem members‚Äô own resources. = Trends in research funding = In 2014, Israel topped the world for research intensity, reflecting the importance of research and innovation for the economy. Since 2008, however, Israel's research intensity has weakened somewhat (4.21% of GDP in 2013), even as this ratio has experienced impressive growth in the Republic of Korea (4.15% in 2014), Denmark (3.06% in 2013) and Germany (2.94% in 2013). The OECD average was 2.40% of GDP in 2014. Business expenditure on research and development (BERD) continues to account for ~84% of GERD, or 3.49% of GDP. The share of higher education in gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) has decreased since 2003 from 0.69% of GDP to 0.59% of GDP (2013). Despite this drop, Israel ranks 8th among OECD countries for this indicator. The lion's share of GERD (45.6%) in Israel is financed by foreign companies, reflecting the large scale of activity by foreign multinational companies and research centres in the country. The share of foreign funding in university-performed research is also quite significant (21.8%). By the end of 2014, Israel had received ‚Ç¨875.6 million from the European Union's (EU's) Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2007‚Äì2013), 70% of which had gone to universities. Its successor, Horizon 2020 (2014‚Äì2020), has been endowed with nearly ‚Ç¨80 billion in funding, making it the EU's most ambitious research and innovation programme ever. As of February 2015, Israel had received ‚Ç¨119.8 million from the Horizon 2020 programme. In 2013, more than half (51.5%) of government spending was allocated to university research and an additional 29.9% to the development of industrial technologies. Research expenditure on health and the environment has doubled in absolute terms in the past decade but still accounts for less than 1% of total government GERD. Israel is unique among OECD countries in its distribution of government support by objective. Israel ranks at the bottom in government support of research in health care, environmental quality and infrastructure development. There has been insufficient government funding for universities in recent years. University research in Israel is largely grounded in basic research, even though it also engages in applied research and partnerships with industry. Basic research in Israel only accounted for 13% of research expenditure in 2013, compared to 16% in 2006. There has since been an increase in General University Funds and those destined for non-oriented research. = Trends in human resources = In 2012, there were 77 282 full-time equivalent researchers in Israel, 82% of whom had acquired an academic education, 10% of whom were practical engineers and technicians and 8% of whom held other qualifications. Eight out of ten (83.8%) were employed in the business sector, 1.1% in the government sector, 14.4% in the higher education sector and 0.7% in non-profit institutions. In 2011, 28% of senior academic staff were women, up by 5% over the previous decade (from 25% in 2005). Although the representation of women has increased, it remains very low in engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer sciences (10%) relative to education (52%) and paramedical occupations (63%). There is a visible ageing of scientists and engineers in some fields. For instance, about three-quarters of researchers in the physical sciences are over the age of 50 and the proportion is even higher for practical engineers and technicians. The shortage of professional staff will be a major handicap for the national innovation system in the coming years, as the growing demand for engineers and technical professionals begins to outpace supply. During the 2012/2013 academic year, 34% of bachelor's degrees were obtained in fields related to science and engineering in Israel. This compares well with the proportion in the Republic of Korea (40%) and most Western countries (about 30% on average). The proportion of Israeli graduates in scientific disciplines and engineering was slightly lower at the master's level (27%) but dominated at PhD level (56%). Recent statistics support the assertion that Israel may be living on the ‚Äòfruits of the past‚Äô, that is to say, on the heavy investment made in primary, secondary and tertiary education during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Between 2007 and 2013, the number of graduates in physical sciences, biological sciences and agriculture dropped, even though the total number of university graduates progressed by 19% (to 39 654). Recent data reveal that Israeli educational achievements in the core curricular subjects of mathematics and science are low in comparison to other OECD countries, as revealed by the exam results of Israeli 15-year olds in the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. Public spending on primary education has also fallen below the OECD average. The public education budget accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2002 but only 5.6% in 2011. The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16‚Äì18% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%. There is concern at the deteriorating quality of teachers at all levels of education and the lack of stringent demands on students to strive for excellence. In recent years, Israel encountered the problem of shortage of specialists in the high-tech industry. Now high technology sector is rapidly growing and demand for tech talent increasing as well - the further growth of the industry depends on it. The shortage also generates a significant and disproportionate increase in salaries, which causes companies to look for new employees abroad. To solve the problem Israel's Council for Higher Education has already launched a five-years program to increase the number of graduates from computer science and engineering programs by 40%.  Research universities  Israel has seven research universities: Bar-Ilan University, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the University of Haifa, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, Tel Aviv University and the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot. Other scientific research institutions include the Volcani Institute of Agricultural Research in Beit Dagan, the Israel Institute for Biological Research and the Soreq Nuclear Research Center. The Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center at Sde Boker is an alternative energy research institute established in 1987 by the Ministry of National Infrastructures to study alternative and clean energy technologies. Israeli universities are ranked among the top 50 academic institutions in the world in the following scientific disciplines: in chemistry (Technion); in computer science (Weizmann Institute of Science, Technion, Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University); in mathematics and natural sciences (Hebrew University, Technion) and in engineering (Technion). In 2009, Mor Tzaban, an Israeli high school student from Netivot, won first prize in the First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics competition. In 2012, Yuval Katzenelson of Kiryat Gat won first prize with a paper entitled \\"Kinetic energy of inert gas in a regenerative system of activated carbon.\\" The Israeli delegation won 14 more prizes in the competition: 9 Israelis students won second prize, one won third prize and one won fourth prize.  Research and Development center  Except universities, Israel has seven R&D; center in the periphery. These centers were established by the Ministry of Science and Technology, and include Migal and the Dead Sea and Arava science center. Their orientation is based on applied science and the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general population. To date, seven centers are working with significant academic impact and relevance to the region.  Scientific output  The number of Israeli publications stagnated between 2005 and 2014, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Consequently, the number of Israeli publications per million inhabitants also declined: between 2008 and 2013, it dropped from 1 488 to 1 431; this trend reflects a relative constancy in scholarly output in the face of relatively high population growth (1.1% in 2014) for a developed country and near-zero growth in the number of full-time equivalent researchers in universities. Between 2005 and 2014, Israeli scientific output was particularly high in life sciences. Israeli universities do particularly well in computer science but publications in this field tend to appear mostly in conference proceedings, which are not included in the Web of Science. Israeli publications have a high citation rate and a high share of papers count among the 10 percent most-cited. The share of papers with foreign co-authors is almost twice the OECD average, which is typical of small countries with a developed scientific and technological ecosystem. A team of 50 Israeli scientists work full-time at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which operates the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Israel was granted observer status in 1991 before becoming a fully fledged member in 2014. An Israeli delegation headed by President Shimon Peres visited the particle accelerator in 2011. Israeli scientists collaborate mostly with Western countries such as the European Union and the United States but there has been strong growth in recent years in collaboration with East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea as well as India and Singapore.  Technology transfer  = History = Research conducted at Israeli universities and institutes is shared with the private sector through technology transfer (TT) units. Israel's first university TT unit, Yeda, was established by the Weizmann Institute of Science in the 1950s. Research in such fields as arid and semi-arid zone agricultural engineering was transferred to kibbutzim and private farmers on a gratis basis and agricultural knowledge was shared with developing countries. In 1964, Yissum, the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was founded. Since the 1990s, the traditional dual mission of universities of teaching and research has broadened to include a third mission: engagement with society and industry. This evolution has been a corollary of the rise of the electronics industry and information technology services, along with a surge in the number of research personnel following the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union. Israel has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry. There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy. = University-industry collaboration = All Israeli research universities have technology transfer offices. Recent research conducted by the Samuel Neaman Institute has revealed that, between 2004 and 2013, the universities‚Äô share of patent applications constituted 10‚Äì12% of the total inventive activity of Israeli applicants. This is one of the highest shares in the world and is largely due to the intensive activity of the universities‚Äô technology transfer offices. The Weizmann Institute's technology transfer office, Yeda, has been ranked the third-most profitable in the world. Through exemplary university‚Äìindustry collaboration, the Weizmann Institute of Science and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have discovered and developed the Copaxone drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Copaxone is Teva's biggest-selling drug, with US$1.68 billion in sales in the first half of 2011. Since the drug's approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, it is estimated that the Weizmann Institute of Science has earned nearly US$2 billion in royalties from the commercialization of its intellectual property. = International technology transfer = In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly's Economic and Financial Committee adopted an Israeli-sponsored draft resolution on agricultural technology transfer to developing countries. The resolution called on developed countries to make their knowledge and know-how accessible to the developing world as part of the UN campaign to eradicate hunger and dire poverty by 2015. The initiative is an outgrowth of Israel's many years of contributing its know-how to developing nations, especially Africa, in the spheres of agriculture, fighting desertification, rural development, irrigation, medical development, computers and the empowerment of women.  Venture capital  As new technology companies require money and seed capital to grow and thrive, Israel's science and technology sector is backed by a strong venture capital industry. Between 2004 and 2013, the Israeli venture capital industry played a fundamental role in funding the development of Israel's high-tech sector. In 2013, Israeli companies had raised more venture capital as a share of GDP than companies in any other country as it attracted US$2 346 million alone during that year. Today, Israel is considered one of the biggest venture capital centers in the world outside the United States of America. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include tax exemptions on Israeli venture capital, funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Israeli high-tech companies. These organizations include some of the world's largest multinational technology companies, including Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Siemens and Samsung. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments. Nowadays, Israeli companies are considered to be more popular than their American peers. For comparison, investments volume in Israeli startups grew by 140% during 2014-2018 and investments in technological startups from the U.S. grew by 64%.  Intellectual property rights  Intellectual property rights in Israel protect copyright and performers‚Äô rights, trademarks, geographical indicators, patents, industrial designs, topographies of integrated circuits, plant breeds and undisclosed business secrets. Both contemporary Israeli legislation and case law are influenced by laws and practices in modern countries, particularly Anglo-American law, the emerging body of EU law and proposals by international organizations. Israel has made a concerted effort to improve the economy's ability to benefit from an enhanced system of intellectual property rights. This includes increasing the resources of the Israel Patent Office, upgrading enforcement activities and implementing programmes to bring ideas funded by government research to the market. Between 2002 and 2012, foreigners accounted for nearly 80% of the patent applications filed with the Israel Patent Office. A sizeable share of foreign applicants seeking protection from the Israel Patent Office are pharmaceutical companies such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen, Novartis, Merck, Bayer-Schering, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer, which happen to be the main business competitors of Israel's own Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Israel ranks tenth in the world for the number of patent applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by country of residence of the first-named inventor. Israeli inventors file far more applications with USPTO (5 436 in 2011) than with the European Patent Office (EPO). Moreover, the number of Israeli filings with EPO dropped from 1400 to 1063 between 2006 and 2011. This preference for USPTO is largely because foreign research centres implanted in Israel are primarily owned by US firms such as IBM, Intel, Sandisk, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google or Hewlett‚ÄìPackard. The inventions of these companies are attributed to Israel as the inventor of the patent but not as the owner (applicant or assignee). The loss of intellectual property into the hands of multinationals occurs mainly through the recruitment of the best Israeli talent by the local research centres of multinational firms. Although the Israeli economy benefits from the activity of the multinationals‚Äô subsidiaries through job creation and other means, the advantages are relatively small compared to the potential economic gains that might have been achieved, had this intellectual property been utilized to support and foster the expansion of mature Israeli companies of a considerable size.  Applied science and engineering  = Energy =  Solar power  alt=A horizontal parabolic dish, with a triangular structure on its top. As of 2014, Israel leads the 2014 Global Cleantech Innovation Index. The country's lack of conventional energy sources has spurred extensive research and development of alternative energy sources and Israel has developed innovative technologies in the solar energy field. Israel has become the world's largest per capita user of solar water heaters in the home. A new, high-efficiency receiver to collect concentrated sunlight has been developed, which will enhance the use of solar energy in industry as well. In a 2009 report by the CleanTech Group, Israel ranked number 5 clean tech country in the world. The Arrow Ecology company has developed the ArrowBio process a patented system which takes trash directly from collection trucks and separates organic and inorganic materials through gravitational settling, screening, and hydro-mechanical shredding. The system is capable of sorting huge volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into biogas and rich agricultural compost. The system is used in California, Australia, Greece, Mexico, the United Kingdom and in Israel. For example, an ArrowBio plant that has been operational at the Hiriya landfill site since December 2003 serves the Tel Aviv area, and processes up to 150 tons of garbage a day. In 2010, Technion ‚Äì the Israel Institute of Technology ‚Äì established the Grand Technion Energy Program (GTEP). This multidisciplinary task-force brings together Technion's top researchers in energy science and technology from over nine different faculties. GTEP's 4-point strategy targets research and development of alternative fuels; renewable energy sources; energy storage and conversion; and energy conservation. GTEP is presently the only center in Israel offering graduate studies in energy science and technology to bring the energy skills and know- how to address the energy challenges of the future.  Natural gas  Since 1999, large reserves of natural gas have been discovered off Israel's coast. This fossil fuel has become the primary fuel for electricity generation in Israel and is gradually replacing oil and coal. In 2010, 37% of electricity in Israel was generated from natural gas, leading to savings of US$1.4 billion for the economy. In 2015, this rate is expected to surpass 55%. In addition, the usage of natural gas in industry ‚Äì both as a source of energy and as a raw material ‚Äì is rapidly expanding, alongside the requisite infrastructure. This is giving companies a competitive advantage by reducing their energy costs and lowering national emissions. Since early 2013, almost the entire natural gas consumption of Israel has been supplied by the Tamar field, an Israeli‚ÄìAmerican private partnership. The estimated reserves amount to about 1 000 BCM, securing Israel's energy needs for many decades to come and making Israel a potentially major regional exporter of natural gas. In 2014, initial export agreements were signed with the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Egypt; there are also plans to export natural gas to Turkey and the EU via Greece. In 2011, the government asked the Academy of Sciences and Humanities to convene a panel of experts to consider the full range of implications of the most recent discoveries of natural gas. The panel recommended encouraging research into fossil fuels, training engineers and focusing research efforts on the impact of gas production on the Mediterranean Sea's ecosystem. The Mediterranean Sea Research Centre of Israel was established in 2012 with an initial budget of NIS 70 million; new study programmes have since been launched at the centre to train engineers and other professionals for the oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, the Office of the Chief Scientist, among others, plans to use Israel's fledgling natural gas industry as a stepping stone to building capacity in advanced technology and opening up opportunities for Israeli innovation targeting the global oil and gas markets. = Space science and technology = Ofek-7 satellite launch through Shavit vehicle During the 1970s and 1980s Israel began developing the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and related sciences. In November 1982, the Minister of Science and Technology, Yuval Ne'eman, established the Israel Space Agency (ISA), to coordinate and supervise a national space program as well as to conduct space, planetary, and aviation research. Because of geographical constraints, as well as safety considerations, the Israeli space program focuses on very small satellites loaded with payloads of a high degree of sophistication, and cooperation with other national space agencies.About ISA ‚Äì Israel Space Agency Israel Space Agency, Israel Ministry of Science and Technology, Retrieved 2009-12-15 The Technion Asher Space Research Institute plays a central role in educating the aerospace engineers of the next generation. In 2009 Israel was ranked 2nd among 20 top countries in space sciences by Thomson Reuters agency. Israel became the eighth nation in the world to have an orbital launch capability when it deployed its first satellite, Ofeq-1, using the locally built Shavit launch vehicle on September 19, 1988, and has made important contributions in a number of areas in space research, including laser communication, research into embryo development and osteoporosis in space, pollution monitoring, and mapping geology, soil and vegetation in semi-arid environments.Israeli Space Research by Wendy Elliman, in Jewish Virtual Library, Retrieved 5 December 2009 Key projects include the TAUVEX telescope, the Tel Aviv University Ultra Violet Experiment, a UV telescope for astronomical observations which was developed in the 1990s to be accommodated on an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) geo-synchronous satellite GSAT-4, for joint operation and use by Indian and Israeli scientists; the VENUS microsatellite, developed in collaboration with the French space agency, CNES, which will use an Israeli- developed space camera, electric space engine and algorithms; and MEIDEX (Mediterranean ‚Äì Israel Dust Experiment), in collaboration with NASA.ISA International Relations Israel Space Agency, Israel Ministry of Science and Technology, Retrieved 15 December 2009 Ilan Ramon was Israel's first astronaut. Ramon was the space shuttle payload specialist on board the fatal STS-107 mission of Space Shuttle Columbia, in which he and the six other crew members were killed in a re-entry accident over the southern United States. Ramon had been selected as a payload specialist in 1997 and trained at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from 1998 until 2003.Payload Specialist Astronaut Bio: Ilan Ramon, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Retrieved 5 December 2009 Among other experiments, Ramon was responsible for the MEIDEX project in which he was required to take pictures of atmospheric aerosol (dust) in the Mediterranean area using a multispectral camera designed to provide scientific information about atmospheric aerosols and the influence of global changes on the climate, and data for the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. Researchers from Tel Aviv University (TAU) were responsible for the scientific aspect of the experiment. The TAU team also worked with a US company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, to construct and test special flight instruments for the project.U.S.-Israel Cooperation in Space by Shira Schoenberg and Mitchell Bard, in Jewish Virtual Library, Retrieved 5 December 2009 = Aerospace engineering = Gulfstream G280 transcontinental business jet was designed and is currently produced for Gulfstream Aerospace by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Aerospace engineering related to the country's defense needs has generated technological development with consequent civilian spin-offs. The Arava short take-off and landing (STOL) plane manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries was the first aircraft to be produced in Israel, in the late 1960s, for both military and civilian uses. This was followed by the production of the Westwind business jet from 1965 to 1987, and later variants, the Astra and the Gulfstream G100, which are still in active service. Israel is among the few countries capable of launching satellites into orbit and locally designed and manufactured satellites have been produced and launched by Israel Aerospace Industries(IAI), Israel's largest military engineering company, in cooperation with the Israel Space Agency. The AMOS-1 geostationary satellite began operations in 1996 as Israel's first commercial communications satellite. It was built primarily for direct-to-home television broadcasting, TV distribution and VSAT services. AMOS-2 was launched in December 2003 and a further series of AMOS communications satellites (AMOS 2 ‚Äì 5i) are operated or in development by the Spacecom Satellite Communications company, headquartered in Ramat-Gan, Israel. Spacecom provides satellite telecommunications services to countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Another satellite, the Gurwin-II TechSAT, designed and manufactured by the Technion, was launched in July 1998 to provide communications, remote sensing and research services. EROS, launched in 2000, is a non-geostationary orbit satellite for commercial photography and surveillance services. Israel also develops, manufactures, and exports a large number of related aerospace products, including rockets and satellites, display systems, aeronautical computers, instrumentation systems, drones and flight simulators. Israel's second largest defense company is Elbit Systems, which makes electro-optical systems for air, sea and ground forces; drones; control and monitoring systems; communications systems and more. The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology is home to the Asher Space Research Institute, which is unique in Israel as a university-based center of space research. At ASRI, Israeli students designed, built and launched their own satellite: Gurwin TechSat. = Agricultural engineering = Anaerobic digesters at Hiriya waste facility Israel's agricultural sector is characterized by an intensive system of production stemming from the need to overcome the scarcity in natural resource, particularly water and arable land, in a country where more than half of its area is desert. The growth in agricultural production is based on close cooperation of scientists, farmers and agriculture-related industries and has resulted in the development of advanced agricultural technology, water-conserving irrigation methods, anaerobic digestion, greenhouse technology, desert agriculture and salinity research. Israeli companies also supply irrigation, water conservation and greenhouse technologies and know-how to other countries.Agrotechnology Company Directory in The Israel Export and International Cooperation Institute Retrieved 2009-12-02 The modern technology of drip irrigation was invented in Israel by Simcha Blass and his son Yeshayahu. Instead of releasing water through tiny holes, blocked easily by tiny particles, water was released through larger and longer passageways by using velocity to slow water inside a plastic emitter. The first experimental system of this type was established in 1959 when Blass partnered with Kibbutz Hatzerim to create an irrigation company called Netafim. Together they developed and patented the first practical surface drip irrigation emitter. This method was very successful and had spread to Australia, North America and South America by the late 1960s. Israeli farmers rely heavily on greenhouse technology to ensure a constant, year-round supply of high quality produce, while overcoming the obstacles posed by adverse climatic conditions, and water and land shortages. Technologies include computerized greenhouse climate control, greenhouse shading, irrigation, fertigation, greenhouse water recycling and biological control of plant disease and insects, allow farmers to control most production parameters. As a result, Israeli farmers successfully grow 3 million roses per hectare in season and an average of 300 tons of tomatoes per hectare, four times the amount harvested in open fields. = Computer engineering = Technion - Israel Institute of Technology (faculty of Computer Science) building Israeli companies excel in computer software and hardware development, particularly computer security technologies, semiconductors and communications. Israeli firms include Check Point, a leading firewall firm; Amdocs, which makes business and operations support systems for telecoms; Comverse, a voice-mail company; and Mercury Interactive, which measures software performance. A high concentration of high-tech industries in the coastal plain of Israel has led to the nickname Silicon Wadi (lit: \\"Silicon Valley\\"). Both Israeli and international companies are based there. Intel, Microsoft, and Apple built their first overseas research and development centers in Israel, and other high-tech multi-national corporations, such as IBM, Cisco Systems, and Motorola, have opened facilities in the country. Intel developed its dual-core Core Duo processor at its Israel Development Center in Haifa. More than 3,850 start-ups have been established in Israel, making it second only to the US in this sectorSenor and Singer, Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle and has the largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies outside North America. Optics, electro-optics, and lasers are significant fields and Israel produces fiber-optics, electro-optic inspection systems for printed circuit boards, thermal imaging night-vision systems, and electro-optics-based robotic manufacturing systems. Research into robotics first began in the late 1970s, has resulted in the production of robots designed to perform a wide variety of computer aided manufacturing tasks, including diamond polishing, welding, packing, and building. Research is also conducted in the application of artificial intelligence to robots. Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science and Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology are ranked among the top 20 academic institutions in the world in computer science. An Israeli, CEO and president of M-Systems, Dov Moran, invented the first flash drive in 1998.  Cybersecurity  In November 2010, the Israeli prime minister entrusted a task force with responsibility for formulating national plans to place Israel among the top five countries in the world for cybersecurity. On 7 August 2011, the government approved the establishment of the National Cyber Bureau to promote the Israeli cyberdefence industry. The bureau is based in the Prime Minister's Office. The National Cyber Bureau allocated NIS 180 million (circa US$50 million) over 2012‚Äì2014 to encourage cyber research and dual military‚Äìcivilian R&D; the funding is also being used to develop human capital, including through the creation of cybersecurity centres at Israeli universities that are funded jointly by the National Cyber Bureau and the universities themselves. In January 2014, the prime minister launched CyberSpark, Israel's cyber innovation park, as part of plans to turn Israel into a global cyber hub. Located in the city of Beer- Sheva to foster economic development in southern Israel, CyberSpark is a geographical cluster of leading cyber companies, multinational corporations and universities, involving Ben Gurion University of the Negev, technology defence units, specialized educational platforms and the national Cyber Event Readiness Team. About half of the firms in CyberSpark are Israeli, mostly small to medium-sized. Multinational companies operating in CyberSpark include EMC2, IBM, Lockheed Martin and Deutsche Telekom. PayPal recently acquired the Israeli start-up CyActive and has since announced plans to set up its second Israeli research centre in CyberSpark, with a focus on cybersecurity. This acquisition is just one of the many Israeli cybersecurity start-ups acquired by multinational companies in the past few years. Major acquisitions of Israeli start-ups in 2014 include Intellinx, purchased by Bottomline Technologies, and Cyvera, purchased by Palo Alto Networks. The National Cyber Bureau has estimated that the number of Israeli cyberdefence companies had doubled in the past five years to about 300 by 2014. Israeli companies account for an estimated 10% of global sales, which currently total an estimated US$60 billion. Total research spending on cyberdefence in Israel quadrupled between 2010 and 2014 from US$50 million to US$200 million, bringing Israel's spending to about 15% of global research spending on cyberdefence in 2014. Cybersecurity technologies are exported by Israel in accordance with the Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral agreement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. The Israeli cyberarms firm, NSO Group Technologies had reportedly been selling its Pegasus spyware to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other repressive Gulf states, with official mediation of the Israeli government. The software permits law enforcement authorities to hack into cellphones, copy their contents and sometimes even to control their camera and audio recording capabilities. In 2018, a lawsuit was filed against NSO accusing it of secretly helping Saudi Arabia to spy Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, later murdered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. In 2019, WhatsApp sued NSO accusing it of helping government spies in a hacking spree, where they broke into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across 20 countries, targeting diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials. = Hydraulic engineering = Since rain falls only in the winter, and largely in the northern part of the country, irrigation and water engineering is vital to the country's economic survival and growth. Large-scale projects to direct water from rivers and reservoirs in the north, to make optimal use of groundwater, and to reclaim flood overflow and sewage have been undertaken. The largest such project was a national water distribution system called the National Carrier, completed in 1964, flowing from the country's biggest freshwater lake, the Sea of Galilee, to the northern Negev desert, through huge channels, pipes and tunnels.Sachar, Howard M., ‚ÄúA history of Israel: from the rise of Zionism to our time‚Äù, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 3rd ed., (2007), pp. 518‚Äì520 The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant was the largest in the world at the time it was built. The project was developed as a BOT (build-operate-transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran.  Water-saving technologies  According to water experts, pipe leakage is one of the major problems confronting the global water supply today. For Israel, which is two-thirds desert, water-saving technologies are of critical importance. The International Water Association has cited Israel as one of the leaders in innovative methods to reduce \\"non-revenue water,\\" i.e., water lost in the system before reaching the customer. = Military engineering = IAI Harop, Israel, is the world's largest exporter of drones. Rejection of requests for weapons and technologies, arms sanctions and massive rearmament of the Arab countries prodded Israel into the development of a broad-based indigenous arms industry. The Israel Defense Forces relies heavily on local military technology and high-tech weapons systems designed and manufactured in Israel. Israeli-developed military equipment includes small arms, anti-tank rockets and missiles, boats and submarines, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, unmanned surface vehicles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), air- defense systems, weapon stations and radar. An impetus for the development of the industry was the embargo on arms sales to Israel during the Six-Day War which prompted Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), founded as a maintenance facility in 1953, to begin developing and assembling its own aircraft, including the Kfir, the Arava and the Nesher. Israeli soldier with Spike (missile) Notable technology includes the Uzi submachine gun, introduced in 1954, the country's main battle tank, the Merkava, and the jointly designed Israeli and U.S. Arrow missile, one of the world's only operational, advanced anti-ballistic missile systems. The Iron Dome mobile air defense system developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems is designed to intercept short- range rockets and artillery shells. The system was created as a defensive countermeasure to the rocket threat against Israel's civilian population on its northern and southern borders, and was declared operational and initially deployed in the first quarter of 2011. It is designed to intercept very short- range threats up to 70 kilometers in all-weather situations. On April 7, 2011, the system successfully intercepted a Grad rocket launched from Gaza, marking the first time in history a short-range rocket was ever intercepted. Israel has also developed a network of reconnaissance satellites. The Ofeq (lit. Horizon) series (Ofeq 1 ‚Äì Ofeq 7) were launched between 1988 and 2007. The satellites were carried by Shavit rockets launched from Palmachim Airbase. Both the satellites and the launchers were designed and manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), with Elbit Systems' El-Op division supplying the optical payload. Israel also has the first all-around operational active defense system for tanks named Trophy, successfully intercepting anti tank missiles fired at Merkava tanks. = Life sciences = Given endoscopic capsule Israel has an advanced infrastructure of medical and paramedical research and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, biomedical, and clinical research account for over half of the country's scientific publications, and the industrial sector has used this extensive knowledge to develop pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and treatment therapies. Biotechnology Israel has over 900 biotechnology and life sciences companies in operation throughout the country with nearly 50 to 60 formed each year. Many multinational corporations such as J&J;, Perrigo, GE Healthcare and Phillips Medical have all established branches in Israel.  Genetics and cancer research  Israeli scientists have developed methods for producing a human growth hormone and interferon, a group of proteins effective against viral infections. Copaxone, a medicine effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, was developed in Israel from basic research to industrial production. Genetic engineering has resulted in a wide range of diagnostic kits based on monoclonal antibodies, with other microbiological products. Advanced stem cell research takes place in Israel. The first steps in the development of stem cell studies occurred in Israel, with research in this field dating back to studies of bone marrow stem cells in the early 1960s. By 2006, Israeli scientists were leaders on a per capita basis in the number of articles published in scientific journals related to stem cell research. In 2011, Israeli scientist Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun led a team which produced the first stem cells from endangered species, a breakthrough that could save animals in danger of extinction. In 2012, Israel was one of the world leaders in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita. Solomon Wasser, a professor from Haifa University, has found that Cyathus striatus is effective in treating pancreatic cancer based on early animal trials.  Biomedical engineering  Sophisticated medical equipment for both diagnostic and treatment purposes has been developed and marketed worldwide, such as computer tomography (CT) scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, ultrasound scanners, nuclear medical cameras, and surgical lasers. Other innovations include a controlled-release liquid polymer to prevent accumulation of tooth plaque, a device to reduce both benign and malignant swellings of the prostate gland, the use of botulin to correct eye squint, and a miniature camera encased in a swallowable capsule used to diagnose gastrointestinal disease, developed by Given Imaging. In 2009, scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a robotic prosthetic hand, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one, allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard, play piano and perform other fine movements. The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips.Israelis help develop revolutionary prosthetic hand ynetnews.com Retrieved 25 November 2009 A new MRI system for identifying and diagnosing tumors developed at the Weizmann Institute has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is already being used in diagnosing breast and testicular cancer. The new system will replace invasive procedures and eliminate waiting time for the results.  Pharmaceutical sciences Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, headquartered in Petah Tikva, Israel, is the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world and one of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. It specializes in generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients and has developed proprietary pharmaceuticals such as Copaxone and Laquinimod for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and Rasagiline for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Weizmann Institute of Science particle accelerator  Nobel Prize laureates  Six Israelis have won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. In 2004, biologists Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover of the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology were two of the three winners of the prize, for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In 2009, Ada Yonath was a co-winner of the prize for her studies of the structure and function of the ribosome. She is the first Israeli woman to win a Nobel Prize. Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013 for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems. Additionally, 1958 Medicine laureate Joshua Lederberg was born to Israeli Jewish parents, and 2004 Physics laureate David Gross grew up partly in Israel, where he obtained his undergraduate degree. In the social sciences, the Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Daniel Kahneman in 2002, and to Robert Aumann of the Hebrew University in 2005.

Wensleydale is one of only a few Yorkshire Dales not currently named after its principal river, but the older name, Yoredale, can still be seen on some maps and as the Yoredale Series of geological strata. The dale takes its name from the village of Wensley, once the market town for the dale. The valley is famous for its cheese, with the main commercial production at Hawes. Also famous are its ales from Theakston Brewery and Black Sheep Brewery in Masham. Most of the dale is within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Part of lower Wensleydale, below East Witton, is within the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Addlebrough, a -high fell, dominates the local landscape. History Bolton Castle, 2014 Wensleydale was the home of one of Yorkshire's most famous clans, the Metcalfes, after they emigrated from Dentdale. The Metcalfe Society hold records dating back to Metcalfes living in the area during the 14th century. They were one of the most prominent families in Yorkshire for more than five centuries. Sir James Metcalfe (1389‚Äì1472), who was born and lived in Wensleydale, was a captain in the army which fought with King Henry V in the battle of Agincourt in 1415. A fortified manor, Nappa Hall near Askrigg was built by his son Sir Thomas Metcalfe. Metcalfe is still one of the most common surnames in Yorkshire. Bolton Castle, in the village of Castle Bolton, is a notable local historic site. Building of the structure was begun by Richard le Scrope, Lord Treasurer and Lord Chancellor to Richard II, in 1378. The building was finally completed in c.1399; the total cost was approximately 18,000 marks. Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned there for six months, ending in January 1569, under head keeper Sir Francis Knollys, housed in the apartment of Henry Scrope; she was allowed a retinue of 51, with 30 housed in the castle. The story goes that she once escaped and made her way towards Leyburn but was captured at a spot on \\"The Shawl\\" called \\"Queen's Gap\\". Geography Cauldron Falls in West Burton Wensleydale's principal settlements are Hawes and Leyburn; Aysgarth, Bainbridge, and Middleham are well-known villages. The shortest river in England, the River Bain, links Semerwater to the River Ure, at Bainbridge, the home to an Ancient Roman fort (part of the Roman road is walkable, up Wether Fell). Hardraw Force, the highest above-ground unbroken waterfall in England, is located at Hardraw, near Hawes. Aysgarth Falls Aysgarth Falls (High, Middle, Low) are famous for their beauty (rather than their height), attracting far-off visitors; they were also featured in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Some scenes from the 1992 film Wuthering Heights were also filmed at the falls. Other notable waterfalls are at Wensley (Harmby Falls), West Burton, and Whitfield Gill Force, near Askrigg. Wensleydale stretches some from west to east. It lies between Wharfedale (to the south), and the quieter Swaledale (to the north, via Buttertubs Pass). Several lesser-known dales are branches of Wensleydale: on the north side Cotterdale, Fossdale and Apedale and on the south side, from west to east, Widdale, Sleddale, Raydale, Bishopdale, Waldendale and Coverdale. Below Wensleydale, the River Ure flows east and south, becomes navigable, changes its name to the River Ouse, passes through York, becomes the Humber Estuary, flows under the Humber Bridge past Hull, Immingham, and Grimsby, and meets the North Sea off Spurn Head. On the way it collects the waters of the River Swale, River Nidd, River Wharfe, River Aire, River Derwent and River Trent. Tourism Bolton Castle in June 2018, partially restored Wensleydale is a very popular destination in its own right, enhanced by its central location between two other well-known tourist dales: Wharfedale and the quieter Swaledale. Wensleydale is a common destination for visitors who like walking on mountains, moorland, dale-sides, and valley bottoms. Hawes and Leyburn are popular because of their age, location and facilities (pubs, shops, teashops, and hotels). Hawes is the home of rope maker (Outhwaites), where visitors can see the manufacturing process. Hawes is also home to the Wensleydale Creamery, the Dales Countryside Museum, shops and many of places to eat.http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/visit-the- dales/discover-the-dales/our-dales/wensleydale Part of Bolton Castle is a ruin but the other section has been restored; this attraction had a 4.5 star rating in mid 2018 by the users of TripAdvisor who had visited the castle.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g635919-d1449607-Reviews- Bolton_Castle-Leyburn_North_Yorkshire_England.html The Wensleydale Railway operates in Wensleydale. It currently runs between Leeming Bar, the A1 and Redmire, near Castle Bolton. The railway's long-term plan is eventually to run the whole length of the valley and connect again with the National Rail network at both ends: at Garsdale on the Settle-Carlisle Railway in the west and Northallerton on the East Coast Main Line in the east. It is hoped this may help relieve some of the current traffic congestion that the valley suffers from during the busiest months. Some visitors come to Wensleydale due to its connection with Richard III, who was brought up in Middleham Castle. It has the largest castle keep in the North of England. Middleham itself is a market town with pubs and horse-racing connections (several stables). In the market place stands a stone carving, believed to be a boar's head, signifying where the animal market was during the 15th century as well as representing Richard's personal standard, the white boar. Each August, visitors and local people gather at the edge of Leyburn for the Wensleydale Agricultural Show. The 2018 event was scheduled for 25 August.

Knights of the Maccabees was a fraternal organization formed in 1878 in London, Ontario, Canada. Most active in the U.S. state of Michigan, the group's fraternal aspects took a backseat to providing low-cost insurance to members. In the society's early years it also provided other final-expense related benefits such as society cemeteries. The motto of the Knights of Maccabees was the Latin phrase \\"Astra Castra Numen Lumen\\" which means \\"The stars my camp, the Deity my light\\".http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/maccabees.htm History The Knights of the Maccabees was founded in London, Ontario by members of the Order of the Foresters. They based their name, ceremonies and rituals on the Maccabees, a group of Jewish rebels against the Seleucid Empire whose exploits are described in the Books of the Maccabees, considered part of the Biblical canon by Catholics, but included in the Apocrypha by Protestants. The first convention was held on August 7, 1878.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.166Stevens, Albert C. Cyclopedia of Fraternities: A Compilation of Existing Authentic Information and the Results of Original Investigation as to the Origin, Derivation, Founders, Development, Aims, Emblems, Character, and Personnel of More Than Six Hundred Secret Societies in the United States New York : E.B. Treat and Co., 1907 p.152 The group grew rapidly in Canada and several US States, reaching 10,000 members by 1880. The organization was not on an actuarially sound basis - no medical exams were required of new members, and assessments of death was 10 cents for each member. As death claims began piling up, the organizations expenses began to outweigh its income. A group of business men in Michigan, where the order had a number of members, endeavored to put the Maccabees on a sound financial basis. To this end a \\"grand review\\" was held in Buffalo, New York in 1880 to reorganize the society, drawing up a new constitution and laws. Major N. S. Boynton was elected the new Supreme Lieutenant Commander. This created a brief schism with the Canadian group seceding under a man named McLaughlin. In 1881 a meeting of the two factions representatives met at Port Huron, Michigan, and they agreed to reconcile their differences. A committee was appointed, chaired by Boynton, to draft a new constitution acceptable to both factions, and this was agreed to in February 1881.Stevens pp.152-3 Under the new constitution, Great Camps could be formed in states or provinces with more than 1,000 members and the Supreme Tent (overall organization) operated the beneficiary aspect of the organization. The Great Camp of Michigan was incorporated in that state on June 11, 1881, which was considered the foundation date of the reorganized order. Organizational stability remained elusive. At the Supreme Tent in July 1881 the Michigan delegates obtained an amendment to allow individual Great Camps to establish their own beneficiary programs, anticipating that the national organization would become defunct. By 1882, the order had indeed become dormant outside of Michigan, and Boynton became Great Record Keeper and then Great Commander of the state. The Supreme Tent was then revived, again, in September 1883.Stevens pp.153-4 In 1914 the organization changed its name from the Knights of the Maccabees to simply The Maccabees.Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations Westport, CT; Greenwood Press p.212 In terms of finances and benefits, the Maccabees adopted the National Fraternal Congress Tables in 1911 and the American Mortuary Table of Rates in 1920. A \\"Supreme Review\\" conducted in 1958, the Macabees became a mutual life insurance company effective 1961, though still kept some fraternal features.Schmidt p.212Axelrod p.166 Organizationally, the group suffered a split in 1905, when a group called the Western Bees seceded in 1905. This group eventually merged with the Highland Nobles in 1911.Axelrod p.167 In the 1930s the Maccabees began absorbing some smaller fraternal benefit societies, including the Brotherhood of America in 1935, the Slavic Progressive Beneficial Union in 1937 and the Michigan Union Life Association in 1941.Axelrod pp.166-7 =20th Century= * By 1920 the ladies' auxiliary, Ladies of the Maccabees, claimed more than 200,000 members. * In 1926 they established their headquarters at the Maccabees Building in downtown Detroit, Michigan. In 1960 the Maccabees relocated to a new building in Southfield, Michigan - a suburb of Detroit. In 1986 they built new office building, in Southfield. * In 1941 the group gained control of the Michigan Union Life Association, furthering its transformation from a benefit society into a modern, legal-reserve insurance company. * In 1962 the group changed its name again, this time to the Maccabees Mutual Life Insurance Company. * In the 1990s the organization was demutualized and sold to the Royal Insurance Group and operated under the name Royal Maccabees Life Insurance Company. * In 1999 Royal Maccabees was sold by its parent company, Royal & SunAlliance Financial Services, to Swiss Re. Swiss Re merged it into its subsidiary, Reassure America Life Insurance Company. Organization The group was structured on a three tiered model, with local Subordinate Camps, Great Camps at the district level and the whole considered the Supreme Tent. By the 1970s the local groups were called \\"Subordinate Units\\". Head offices were traditionally in Detroit, but in 1965 they were moved to Southfield, Michigan.Schmidt p.213  Membership  Membership was open to all white persons between 18 and 70, though those over 52 were ineligible for the beneficiary features. Applicants had to be of good moral character, bodily healthy and socially acceptable. Furthermore, those engaged in extra-hazardous occupations, such as coal miners, electric line men, aeronauts, people engaged in blasting, the manufacture of highly flammable or explosive material and submarine officers were excluded from membership. Also, no one who was involved in the liquor trade or an alcoholic was admitted. Certain classes of railway employees, expressmen, miners (excluding coal miners) and firemen had to pay an additional 25 cents assessment per each $1,000.Stevens p.154 On December 1, 1896 the Knights had 182,000 members in 40 states and provinces, though a third of the membership was in Michigan. The death rate among the membership was 5.54 per 1,000, which was considered exceptionally low. They also had a permanent headquarters in Port Huron, which had opened in 1892. By 1915 membership had reached 331,756. However, by 1978 membership was down to about 10,000 There were 3,500 members in the US and Canada in 1994. =Degrees= * Degree of Protection - In the Degree of Protection, the candidate was introduced to the demands of Honor, Courage, and Obedience. The candidate learned the history of Maccabee household and how it protected Judea from King Antiochus during the war of independence. To prove themselves fit to \\"join in the cause of humanity,\\" the tyros had to undergo an ordeal. * Degree of Friendship - In the Degree of Friendship, the Commander takes the part of Mattathias, the Lt. Commander that of Judas, the Past Commander that of John (son of Mattathias), and the Chaplain that of Eleazar (son of Mattathias). The candidate received instruction in the nature of friendship. * Degree of Loyalty - In the Degree of Loyalty, the dramatic work revolved around the following characters: Apelles, Mattathias, Matthathias's four sons, Judas, Soldiers, while the candidate, Sentinel, and a Knight took the parts of Jewish peasants. In keeping with the Maccabee legend of the revolt at Modin the patriarch Mattathias remained steadfast to the Jewish religion when ordered to make sacrifice to Roman gods and at great personal risk stops an apostate Jew from offering sacrifice to false gods. The lesson derived from his example was that of genuine patriotism and inculcated the duty to uphold and defend the rights of liberty and conscience when they are threatened by irresponsible power in any form. Additionally, the candidate was reintroduced to the ghost of Eleazar and finally sees the end of the rebellion.http://mill- valley.freemasonry.biz/marin_knights_maccabees.htm  Ladies of the Maccabees  Lady Maccabees Meeting in the Ironville Neighborhood House, Toledo, Ohio, approximately 1909 The Ladies of the Maccabees were the group's female auxiliary. The Ladies began as a local club, or \\"Hive\\" in Muskegon, Michigan, but made application to form a statewide auxiliary at the Great Camps 1886 convention. They were denied. They tried again at the 1887 convention and were turned down. In 1888, permission was given to create a \\"Great Hive\\" for the state. Laws were drawn up and officials elected and the Great Hive of Michigan was chartered in May 1890. Great Hives were founded in other states such as Ohio and New York, and a \\"Supreme Hive\\" was established on October 1, 1892. By December 1, 1896 there were Great Hives in half of the states in the Union as well as Canada and membership was up to 66,000, with 33,000 in Michigan alone. The Ladies of the Maccabees was the first fraternal benefit society operated exclusively by women.Stevens p.155 In 1915 the Ladies had 179,719 members. The Ladies of the Maccebees merged into the Knights in 1926. In 1892 there was a schism within the auxiliary and a new group was formed called the Ladies of the Modern Maccabees. This group became the Women's Benefit Association in 1915 and the North American Benefit Association in 1966. On March 25, 1886, nine ladies met at the home of Adelphia Grace WardAdelphia Grace Ward https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71192105 (aka Mother of the Order, Past Great Commander) to establishFounder of the Order; Maccabeeism: from its origin to the present pages 64-65 the order of the Ladies of the Modern MaccabeesMaccabeeism: from its origin to the present pages 15-18 (L.O.T.M.M.). This was an insurance benefit society which grew to 80,000 members by 1913 and had paid out over $50 million in endowment benefits. She became known as \\"Mother Ward\\" throughout the length and breadth of Maccabeedom. The Modern Maccabees were later led by schoolteacher Bina West MillerMaccabeeism: from its origin to the present pages 42-43 who wanted to help build a fraternal insurance society for women, and she was quite successful. By the early twentieth century the group had 100,000 members and by the late 1920s over 250,000. It still had 80,000 members in 1994.Axelrod pp.183-4 Notable people *Martha E.

The division fought in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front. The division's insignia was an ankh or ankhus. History The division came into existence on 21 August 1914 under Army Order No. 324, which authorised the formation of the first six new divisions of Kitchener's Army. The division was composed of early wartime volunteers and assembled at Belton Park near Grantham. By late spring 1915, the recruits were judged to be ready for active service, and the division was consequently ordered to reinforce the beleaguered garrison on Gallipoli. The division sailed for the Mediterranean in June and July 1915 and formed part of the Suvla Bay landing force on 7 August. The 6th (Service) Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales Own (Yorkshire Regiment) of the 32nd Brigade was the first Kitchener unit to be involved in a major offensive operation of the war. Their action at Lala Baba Hill, on 7 August 1915, during the Suvla Bay landings, was costly, the commanding officer ‚ÄìLieutenant Colonel E. H. Chapman ‚Äìwas killed as were all but 3 of the officers but they enter the history books with the hill being renamed York hill for the duration of the Gallipoli Campaign. The division continued to serve at Gallipoli, suffering high casualties, until the evacuation of Suvla in December 1915. After a period of time in Egypt guarding the Suez Canal, the division was transferred to the Western Front and served there from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 until the end of the war, which arrived on 11 November 1918. On 28 June 1919, exactly five years since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the 11th (Northern) Division was officially disbanded, having sustained more than 32,100 casualties during the war.

It connects Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan and Ceyhan, a port on the south- eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, via Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. It is the second-longest oil pipeline in the former Soviet Union, after the Druzhba pipeline. The first oil that was pumped from the Baku end of the pipeline reached Ceyhan on 28 May 2006. History =Planning= The Caspian Sea lies above one of the world's largest collections of oil and gas fields. As the sea is landlocked, transporting oil to Western markets is complicated. During Soviet times, all transportation routes from the Caspian region were through Russia. The collapse of the Soviet Union inspired a search for new routes. Russia first insisted that the new pipeline should pass through its territory, then declined to participate. In the spring of 1992, the Turkish Prime Minister S√ºleyman Demirel proposed to Central Asian countries including Azerbaijan that the pipeline run through Turkey. The first document on the construction of the Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline was signed between Azerbaijan and Turkey on 9 March 1993 in Ankara. The Turkish route meant a pipeline from Azerbaijan would run through Georgia or Armenia, but the route through Armenia was politically impossible due to the unresolved war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. This left the circuitous Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey route, longer and more expensive to build than the other option. The project gained momentum following the Ankara Declaration, adopted on 29 October 1998 by President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Turkey S√ºleyman Demirel, and President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov. The declaration was witnessed by the United States Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, who expressed strong support for the pipeline. The intergovernmental agreement in support of the pipeline was signed by Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey on 18 November 1999, during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Istanbul, Turkey. =Construction= The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company (BTC Co.) was established in London on 1 August 2002. The ceremony launching construction of the pipeline was held on 18 September 2002. Construction began in April 2003 and was completed in 2005. The Azerbaijan section was constructed by Consolidated Contractors International of Greece, and Georgia's section was constructed by a joint venture of France's Spie Capag and UK Petrofac International. The Turkish section was constructed by BOTA≈û Petroleum Pipeline Corporation. Bechtel was the main contractor for engineering, procurement and construction. =Inauguration= On 25 May 2005, the pipeline was inaugurated at the Sangachal Terminal by President Ilham Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic, President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia and President Ahmet Sezer of Turkey, joined by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and United States Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman. The inauguration of the Georgian section was hosted by President Mikheil Saakashvili at the pumping station near Gardabani on 12 October 2005. The inauguration ceremony at Ceyhan terminal was held on 13 July 2006. The pipeline was gradually filled with 10 million barrels of oil flowing from Baku and reaching Ceyhan on 28 May 2006. The first oil was loaded at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (Haydar Aliyev Terminal) onto a tanker named British Hawthorn. The tanker sailed on 4 June 2006 with about of crude oil. Description Petroleum pipelines to Europe =Route= The long pipeline starts at the Sangachal Terminal near Baku in Azerbaijan, crosses Georgia and terminates at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (Haydar Aliyev Terminal) on the south-eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. of the pipeline lie in Azerbaijan, in Georgia and in Turkey. It crosses several mountain ranges at altitudes to . It also traverses 3,000 roads, railways, and utility lines‚Äîboth overground and underground‚Äîand 1,500 watercourses up to wide (in the case of the Ceyhan River in Turkey). The pipeline occupies a corridor eight meters wide, and is buried to a depth of at least one meter. The pipeline runs parallel to the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline, which transports natural gas from the Sangachal Terminal to Erzurum in Turkey. From Sarƒ±z to Ceyhan, the Samsun‚ÄìCeyhan oil pipeline will be parallel to the BTC pipeline. =Technical features= The pipeline has a projected lifespan of 40 years, and at normal capacity it transports . It needs of oil to fill the pipeline. Oil flows at per second. There are eight pump stations, two in Azerbaijan, two in Georgia, four in Turkey. The project includes also the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (officially the Haydar Aliyev Terminal, named after the Azerbaijani late president Heydar Aliyev), three intermediate pigging stations, one pressure reduction station, and 101 small block valves. It was constructed from 150,000 individual joints of line pipe, each measuring in length. This corresponds to a total weight of . The pipeline is diameter for most of its length, narrowing to diameter as it nears Ceyhan. =Cost and financing= The pipeline cost US$3.9 billion. The construction created 10,000 short-term jobs and the operation of the pipeline requires 1,000 long-term employees across a 40-year period. 70% of the costs are funded by third parties, including the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, export credit agencies of seven countries and a syndicate of 15 commercial banks. =Source of supply= The pipeline is supplied by oil from Azerbaijan's Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field in the Caspian Sea via the Sangachal Terminal. This pipeline may also transport oil from Kazakhstan's Kashagan oil field and other oil fields in Central Asia. The government of Kazakhstan announced that it would build a trans-Caspian oil pipeline from the Kazakhstani port of Aktau to Baku, but because of the opposition from both Russia and Iran it started to transport oil to the BTC pipeline by tankers across the Caspian Sea. Not only Kazakh, but also Turkmen oil have transported via Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline. Thus, in 2015, 5,2 million Kazakh and Turkmen oil were transported via this pipeline to the world markets.Rovshan, Ibrahimov, The Development of the Transport Sector in Azerbaijan:The Implementation and Challenges, in: Caucasus International, Volume 6, No 1, Summer 2016, SAM,http://www.elibrary.az/docs/JURNAL/jrn2016_539.pdf,p.3. =Possible transhipment via Israel= It has been proposed that oil from the pipeline be transported to eastern Asia via the Israeli oil terminals at Ashkelon and Eilat, the overland trans-Israel sector being bridged by the Trans-Israel pipeline owned by the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company (EAPC). Ownership The pipeline is owned and operated by BTC Co, a consortium of 11 energy companies. The consortium is managed by BP.

Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. Accessed July 22, 2012. Controversial aspects =Politics= Even before its completion, the pipeline was having an effect on the world's petroleum politics. The South Caucasus, previously seen as Russia's backyard, is now a region of great strategic significance. The U.S. and other Western nations have become much more involved in the affairs of the three nations through which oil will flow. The countries have been trying to use the involvement as a counterbalance to Russian and Iranian economic and military dominance in the region. Russian specialists claim that the pipeline will weaken the Russian influence in the Caucasus. The Russian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee chairman stated that the United States and other Western countries are planning to station soldiers in the Caucasus on the pretext of instability in regions through which the pipeline passes. The project has been criticised due to bypassing and regional isolation of Armenia, as well as for human rights and safety concerns. Ilham Aliev, the president of Azerbaijan, which is in conflict with Armenia, was cited as saying, \\"If we succeed with this project, the Armenians will end in complete isolation, which would create an additional problem for their future, their already bleak future\\". The project also constitutes an important leg of the East‚ÄìWest energy corridor, gaining Turkey greater geopolitical importance. The pipeline supports Georgia's independence from Russian influence. Former President Eduard Shevardnadze, one of the architects and initiators of the project, saw construction through Georgia as a guarantee for the country's future economic and political security and stability. President Mikhail Saakashvili shares this view. \\"All strategic contracts in Georgia, especially the contract for the Caspian pipeline are a matter of survival for the Georgian state,\\" he told reporters on 26 November 2003. =Economics= Although some have touted the pipeline as easing the dependence of the US and other Western nations on oil from the Middle East, it supplies only 1% of global demand during its first stage. The pipeline diversifies the global oil supply and so insures, to an extent, against a failure in supply elsewhere. Critics of the pipeline‚Äîparticularly Russia‚Äîare skeptical about its economic prospects. Construction of the pipeline has contributed to the economies of the host countries. In the first half of 2007, a year after the launch of the pipeline as the main export route for Azerbaijani oil, the real GDP growth of Azerbaijan hit a record of 35%. Substantial transit fees accrue to Georgia and Turkey. For Georgia, the transit fees are expected to produce an average of US$62.5 million per year. Turkey is expected to receive approximately US$200 million in transit fees per year in the initial years of operation, with the possibility that the fees increase to US$290 million per year from year 17 to year 40. Turkey also benefits from an increase of commerce in the port of Ceyhan and other parts of eastern Anatolia, the region which had experienced significant decrease in economic activities since the Gulf War in 1991. The reduction of oil tanker traffic on the Bosphorus will contribute to greater security for Istanbul. To counter concerns that oil money would be siphoned off by corrupt officials, Azerbaijan set up a state oil fund (SOFAZ), mandated with using revenue from natural resources to benefit future generations, bolster support from key international lenders, and improve transparency and accountability. Azerbaijan became the first oil-producing country to join EITI, the British-led Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. =Security= Concerns have been addressed about the security of the pipeline. It bypasses Armenia, which has an unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, crosses through Georgia, which has two unresolved separatist conflicts, and goes through the edges of the Kurdish region of Turkey, which has seen a prolonged and bitter conflict with Kurdish separatists. It will require constant guarding to prevent sabotage, though the fact that almost all of the pipeline is buried will make it harder to attack. Georgia formed a special purpose battalion that would guard the pipeline while the US watched over the area with Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs). On 5 August 2008, a major explosion and fire in Refahiye (eastern Turkey Erzincan Province) closed the pipeline. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) claimed responsibility. The pipeline was restarted on 25 August 2008. There is circumstantial evidence that it was instead a sophisticated cyber attack on the line's control and safety systems that led to increased pressure and an explosion. The attack might have been related to the Russo-Georgian War, which started two days later. However, the cyber attack theory has been largely criticized due to a lack of evidence, and was publicly debunked by ICS cyber security expert Robert M. Lee. In September 2015, unrecognized Nagorno- Karabakh's defense minister, Levon Mnatsakanyan, was cited as saying: \\"This is a very serious financial resource for Azerbaijan and we need to deprive them of these means\\". =Environment= Critics of the pipeline have pointed out it should be properly earthquake engineered because it travels through three active faults in Azerbaijan, four in Georgia and seven in Turkey. Environmental activists fiercely opposed the crossing of the watershed of the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park in Georgia, an area known for mineral water springs and natural beauty, although the pipeline itself does not enter the park. The construction of the pipeline left a highly visible scar across the landscape. The Oxford-based \\"Baku Ceyhan Campaign\\" stated that \\"public money should not be used to subsidize social and environmental problems, purely in the interests of the private sector, but must be conditional on a positive contribution to the economic and social development of people in the region.\\" As Borjomi mineral water is a major export commodity of Georgia, any oil spills there would have a catastrophic effect on the economy. The field joint coating of the pipeline has been controversial over the claim that SPC 2888, the sealant used, was not properly tested. BP and its contractors interrupted work until the problem was eliminated. The pipeline eliminates 350 tanker cargoes per year through the sensitive congested Bosphorus and Dardanelles. =Human rights= Human rights activists criticized Western governments for the pipeline, due to reported human and civil rights abuses by the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan. A Czech documentary film Zdroj (Source) underscores these human rights abuses, such as eminent domain violations in appropriating land for the pipeline's route, and criticism of the government leading to arrest. In fiction The pipeline was a central plot point in the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough (1999). One of the central characters, Elektra King, is responsible for the construction of an oil pipeline through the Caucasus, from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Named the \\"King pipeline\\" in the film, it is a thinly disguised version of the BTC. The pipeline also gets a mention in \\"Aggressor\\", a novel by Andy Mcnab.

Intuitively two systems are bisimilar if they match each other's moves. In this sense, each of the systems cannot be distinguished from the other by an observer.  Formal definition  Given a labelled state transition system (S, \\\\Lambda, ->), where S is a set of states, \\\\Lambda is a set of labels and -> is a set of labelled transitions (i.e., a subset of S √ó \\\\Lambda √ó S), a bisimulation relation is a binary relation R over S (i.e., R ‚äÜ S √ó S) such that both R and its converse R^T are simulations. Equivalently R is a bisimulation if for every pair of elements p, q in S with (p,q) in R, for all Œ± in \\\\Lambda: for all p' in S, :: p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} p' :implies that there is a q' in S such that :: q \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q' :and (p',q') \\\\in R; and, symmetrically, for all q' in S :: q \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q' :implies that there is a p' in S such that :: p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} p' :and (p',q') \\\\in R. Given two states p and q in S, p is bisimilar to q, written p \\\\, \\\\sim \\\\, q, if there is a bisimulation R such that (p, q) is in R. The bisimilarity relation \\\\, \\\\sim \\\\, is an equivalence relation. Furthermore, it is the largest bisimulation relation over a given transition system. Note that it is not always the case that if p simulates q and q simulates p then they are bisimilar. For p and q to be bisimilar, the simulation between p and q must be the converse of the simulation between q and p. Counter-example (in CCS, describing a coffee machine) : M=p.\\\\overline{c}.M+p.\\\\overline{t}.M+p.(\\\\overline{c}.M+\\\\overline{t}.M) and M'=p.(\\\\overline{c}.M'+\\\\overline{t}.M') simulate each other but are not bisimilar.  Alternative definitions  = Relational definition = Bisimulation can be defined in terms of composition of relations as follows. Given a labelled state transition system (S, \\\\Lambda, \\\\rightarrow), a bisimulation relation is a binary relation R over S (i.e., R ‚äÜ S √ó S) such that \\\\forall\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Lambda ::R\\\\ ;\\\\ \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow}\\\\quad {\\\\subseteq}\\\\quad \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow}\\\\ ;\\\\ R :and ::R^{-1}\\\\ ;\\\\ \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow}\\\\quad {\\\\subseteq}\\\\quad \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow}\\\\ ;\\\\ R^{-1} From the monotonicity and continuity of relation composition, it follows immediately that the set of the bisimulations is closed under unions (joins in the poset of relations), and a simple algebraic calculation shows that the relation of bisimilarity‚Äîthe join of all bisimulations‚Äîis an equivalence relation. This definition, and the associated treatment of bisimilarity, can be interpreted in any involutive quantale. = Fixpoint definition = Bisimilarity can also be defined in order theoretical fashion, in terms of fixpoint theory, more precisely as the greatest fixed point of a certain function defined below. Given a labelled state transition system (S, Œõ, ->), define F:\\\\mathcal{P}(S \\\\times S) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}(S \\\\times S) to be a function from binary relations over S to binary relations over S, as follows: Let R be any binary relation over S. F(R) is defined to be the set of all pairs (p,q) in S √ó S such that: : \\\\forall \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Lambda. \\\\, \\\\forall p' \\\\in S. \\\\, p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} p' \\\\, \\\\Rightarrow \\\\, \\\\exists q' \\\\in S. \\\\, q \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q' \\\\,\\\\textrm{ and }\\\\, (p',q') \\\\in R and : \\\\forall \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Lambda. \\\\, \\\\forall q' \\\\in S. \\\\, q \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q' \\\\, \\\\Rightarrow \\\\, \\\\exists p' \\\\in S. \\\\, p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} p' \\\\,\\\\textrm{ and }\\\\, (p',q') \\\\in R Bisimilarity is then defined to be the greatest fixed point of F. = Game theoretical definition = Bisimulation can also be thought of in terms of a game between two players: attacker and defender. \\"Attacker\\" goes first and may choose any valid transition, \\\\alpha, from (p,q). I.e.: (p,q) \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} (p',q) or (p,q) \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} (p,q') The \\"Defender\\" must then attempt to match that transition, \\\\alpha from either (p',q) or (p,q') depending on the attacker's move. I.e., they must find an \\\\alpha such that: (p',q) \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} (p',q') or (p,q') \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} (p',q') Attacker and defender continue to take alternating turns until: * The defender is unable to find any valid transitions to match the attacker's move. In this case the attacker wins. * The game reaches states (p,q) that are both 'dead' (i.e., there are no transitions from either state) In this case the defender wins * The game goes on forever, in which case the defender wins. * The game reaches states (p,q), which have already been visited. This is equivalent to an infinite play and counts as a win for the defender. By the above definition the system is a bisimulation if and only if there exists a winning strategy for the defender. = Coalgebraic definition = A bisimulation for state transition systems is a special case of coalgebraic bisimulation for the type of covariant powerset functor. Note that every state transition system (S, \\\\Lambda, \\\\rightarrow) is bijectively a function \\\\xi_{\\\\rightarrow} from S to the powerset of S indexed by \\\\Lambda written as \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Lambda \\\\times S), defined by :: p \\\\mapsto \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\alpha, q) \\\\in \\\\Lambda \\\\times S : p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q \\\\\\\\}. Let \\\\pi_i \\\\colon S \\\\times S \\\\to S be i-th projection mapping (p, q) to p and q respectively for i = 1, 2; and \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Lambda \\\\times \\\\pi_1) the forward image of \\\\pi_1 defined by dropping the third component :: P \\\\mapsto \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\alpha, p) \\\\in \\\\Lambda \\\\times S : \\\\exists q . (\\\\alpha, p, q) \\\\in P \\\\\\\\} where P is a subset of \\\\Lambda \\\\times S \\\\times S. Similarly for \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Lambda \\\\times \\\\pi_2). Using the above notations, a relation R \\\\subseteq S \\\\times S is a bisimulation on a transition system (S, \\\\Lambda, \\\\rightarrow) if and only if there exists a transition system \\\\gamma \\\\colon R \\\\to \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Lambda \\\\times R) on the relation R such that the diagram upright=1.5 commutes, i.e. for i = 1, 2, the equations :: \\\\xi_\\\\rightarrow \\\\circ \\\\pi_i = \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Lambda \\\\times \\\\pi_i) \\\\circ \\\\gamma hold where \\\\xi_{\\\\rightarrow} is the functional representation of (S, \\\\Lambda, \\\\rightarrow).  Variants of bisimulation  In special contexts the notion of bisimulation is sometimes refined by adding additional requirements or constraints. An example is that of stutter bisimulation, in which one transition of one system may be matched with multiple transitions of the other, provided that the intermediate states are equivalent to the starting state (\\"stutters\\"). A different variant applies if the state transition system includes a notion of silent (or internal) action, often denoted with \\\\tau, i.e. actions that are not visible by external observers, then bisimulation can be relaxed to be weak bisimulation, in which if two states p and q are bisimilar and there is some number of internal actions leading from p to some state p' then there must exist state q' such that there is some number (possibly zero) of internal actions leading from q to q'. A relation \\\\mathcal{R} on processes is a weak bisimulation if the following holds (with \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{R}, \\\\mathcal{R}^{-1} \\\\\\\\}, and a,\\\\tau being an observable and mute transition respectively): \\\\forall p, q. \\\\quad (p,q) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\Rightarrow p \\\\stackrel{\\\\tau}{\\\\rightarrow} p' \\\\Rightarrow \\\\exists q' . \\\\quad q \\\\stackrel{\\\\tau^\\\\ast}{\\\\rightarrow} q' \\\\wedge (p',q') \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\forall p, q. \\\\quad (p,q) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\Rightarrow p \\\\stackrel{a}{\\\\rightarrow} p' \\\\Rightarrow \\\\exists q' . \\\\quad q \\\\stackrel{\\\\tau^\\\\ast a \\\\tau^\\\\ast}{\\\\rightarrow} q' \\\\wedge (p',q') \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} This is closely related to bisimulation up to a relation. Typically, if the state transition system gives the operational semantics of a programming language, then the precise definition of bisimulation will be specific to the restrictions of the programming language. Therefore, in general, there may be more than one kind of bisimulation, (bisimilarity resp.) relationship depending on the context.  Bisimulation and modal logic  Since Kripke models are a special case of (labelled) state transition systems, bisimulation is also a topic in modal logic. In fact, modal logic is the fragment of first-order logic invariant under bisimulation (van Benthem's theorem).  Algorithm  Checking that two finite transition systems are bisimilar can be done in polynomial time.

The Quill is a program to write home computer adventure games.Sinclair User 37 Written by Graeme Yeandle, it was published on the ZX Spectrum by Gilsoft in December 1983. Although available to the general public, it was used by several games companies to create best-selling titles; over 450 commercially published titles for the ZX Spectrum were written using The Quill.  Development  Yeandle has stated that the inspiration for The Quill was an article in the August 1980 issue of Practical Computing by Ken Reed in which Reed described the use of a database to produce an adventure game. After Yeandle wrote one database-driven adventure game, Timeline, for Gilsoft, he realised that a database editor was needed, and it was this software which became The Quill. After the original ZX Spectrum version, The Quill was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, and Apple II. Versions were also published by CodeWriter, Inc. in North America (under the name of AdventureWriter) and a version by Norace in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. A French version was also made by Codewriter. In 1985 Neil Fleming-Smith ported The Quill to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers for Gilsoft. Although not credited in the article, Chris Hobson submitted a patch to Crash magazine which allowed the Spectrum version to save to a Microdrive. This was published in the September 1986 edition The Quill only allowed for the creation of text- only adventures, using a text interpretation process known as a verb-noun parser. Later an add-on called The Illustrator was made to let the user include graphics in the adventures.  Critical reception  The Quill was generally very well received by the computer press at the time of its release. Micro Adventurer described it as \\"a product [...] to revolutionise the whole microcomputer scene\\" and rated it \\"10 out of 10\\", while Computer and Video Games described it as \\"worth every penny of the ¬£14.95 price tag\\", while CRASH said it was \\"almost ludicrously underpriced for what it does and, more importantly, what it allows others to do.\\" Sinclair User were somewhat initially less enthusiastic, saying \\"no package, even if it is brilliant in the production of games using the sausage machine technique, will provide an answer to properly machine-coded and original games\\", although later in 1984 they said \\"The Quill produces programs on a par with handwritten commercial programs\\". The Quill was awarded \\"Best Utility\\" in the CRASH Readers Awards 1984.  Sequel  Following the success of the original, a second generation Quill was produced with more capabilities and sold under the name Professional Adventure Writer for the ZX Spectrum series computers and CP/M computers. In 2001[6] WinPAW was written by Douglas Harter. It could read adventures written in Quill and PAW, but ran under MS-Windows and had a few extensions to the original.

Artedi was born in Anundsj√∂ in the province of √Öngermanland. Intending to become a clergyman, he went after schooling in Harnosand, in 1724, to study theology at Uppsala University, but he turned his attention to medicine and natural history, especially ichthyology, a science that he influenced greatly. In 1728 his countryman Carl Linnaeus arrived in Uppsala, and a lasting friendship was formed between the two from 1729 (as Artedi was away due to the death of his father). In 1732 both left Uppsala, Artedi for England, and Linnaeus for Lappland; before parting they reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the event of death. In 1734 Artedi visited England, mentioning a meeting with Hans Sloane and a whale in London in November downstream of the London Bridge. Artedi left London in summer 1735 and met Linnaeus in Leiden. Artedi was short of money and Linnaeus introduced him to Albertus Seba, a wealthy Dutchman, who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum of his time in Amsterdam. Seba employed Artedi to write descriptions of fishes for his Thesaurus. On the night of 27 September, while returning from Seba's home to his lodgings, he accidentally fell and drowned in a canal. His body was found the next day. Linnaeus heard of the death through Claudius Sohlberg two days later and rushed to Amsterdam. According to agreement, his manuscripts came into the hands of Linnaeus, and his Bibliotheca Ichthyologica and Philosophia Ichthyologica, together with a life of the author, were published at Leiden in 1738 under the title \\"Ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus ...\\". Artedi was buried in a pauper's grave in St Anthony's churchyard in Amsterdam on 2 October 1735. His grave was never marked and the churchyard site has since been appropriated for other purposes. An epitaph, written in Latin by Anders Celsius, and translated into English by George Shaw, is known because it was inscribed on the back flyleaf of Linnaeus's own copy of \\"Ichthyologia\\": :Here lies poor Artedi, in foreign land pyx'd :Not a man nor a fish, but something betwixt, :Not a man, for his life among fishes he past, :Not a fish, for he perished by water at last. A memorial stone to Peter Artedi was erected in Amsterdam Zoological Gardens and unveiled on 28 June 1905; it is inscribed in Latin. Other stone memorials are in Anundsj√∂ and Nordmaling in Sweden. Linnaeus named ArtediaHortus cliffortianus (1738): p. 89; Species plantarum (1753): 242 (Apiaceae), a monotypic genus from the eastern Mediterranean, after his friend.

Biography Ernest Belfort Bax was born on 23 July 1854, in Leamington Spa, son of wealthy garment manufacturers and traditionalist nonconformist parents. In his Reminiscences and Reflexions of a Mid and Late Victorian (1918), he describes the narrow Evangelicanism and Sabbatarianism in which he was brought up which he describes as having left \\"an enduringly unpleasant reminiscence behind it\\". He was privately educated by tutors between the years 1864‚Äì1875, and influenced by George Lewes, William Lecky, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill, which contributed to his dedication to rationalism. At the age of sixteen his interest in public affairs was awakened by the Franco-German War, and by its sequel, the Commune. His political ideas during this period amounted to a commonplace radicalism combined with aspirations to economic equality. In his youth Bax had an interest in music and could play the piano, and at the age of 21 (1875) he went to Germany to study music. He visited there again in 1880 as Berlin correspondent of The Standard. It was then that he met with Eduard von Hartmann and came into contact with German philosophy in general. After studying for a period, his interest in Mill, Spencer and Bain yielded to the German greats Kant and Hegel, and his philosophical interests remained with him for life. Studies in philosophy In 1880 at the age of 26, Bax began studying philosophy in Germany, beginning with Kant and Hegel. In 1883 he produced an English translation of Kant's Prolegomena, and Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, and in 1884 he wrote his Handbook to the History of Philosophy, which was published in 1885 for Bohn's Philosophical Library. Later philosophical works by Bax include The Problem of Reality (1892), The Roots of Reality: Being Suggestions for a Philosophical Reconstruction (1907), Problems of Men, Mind and Morals (1912), and The Real, The Rational, and The Alogical (1920). Men's rights advocacy Bax was a passionate advocate for the social and legal rights of men, which he saw as lacking in comparison to the legal rights of women. His first major article on the subject was Some Bourgeois Idols; Or Ideals, Reals, and Shams (1886), in which he proposed that women were privileged under law at the expense of men. He was to continue writing articles on this topic for most of his life, published notably in Social Democrat, and Justice, and later in The New Age. In 1896, he wrote The Legal Subjection of Men * Reprinted as whose title is a play on John Stuart Mill's 1869 essay \\"The Subjection of Women.\\" In the volume, Bax draws on his extensive experience as a barrister to demonstrate the numerous ways in which the legal code worked in favour of women and to the detriment of men and boys. Chapters in the book include 'Matrimonial Privileges of Women', 'Non-Matrimonial Privileges of Women', 'The Actual Exercise of Women's Sex Privileges', and 'A Sex Noblesse'. Bax was an active antifeminist since, according to him, feminism was failing to address inequities for both sexes evenly. According to Bax, the \\"anti-man crusades\\" of his day were responsible for anti-man laws being both preserved from the old legal canon, and for new laws being passed that were also anti-male and sexist. Bax wrote many articles in The New Age and elsewhere about English laws partial to women against men, and women's privileged position before the law, and expressed his view that women's suffrage would unfairly tip the balance of power to women. In 1913 he published a book, The Fraud of Feminism, detailing feminism's adverse effects. Bax's concern for men's equality fuelled his interest in socialism, to which he turned for a potential solution to what he viewed as the exploitation of males by the capitalist system: > \\"The highest development of modern capitalism, as exemplified in the > English-speaking countries, has placed man to all intents and purposes, > legally under the heel of woman. So far as the relations of the sexes are > concerned, it would be the task of Socialism to emancipate man from this > position, if sex-equality be the goal aimed at. The first step on the road > towards such equality would necessarily consist in the abolition of modern > female privilege.\\" Socialism Bax was first introduced to socialism while studying philosophy in Germany in 1879. He combined socialist ideas with those of Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer and Eduard von Hartmann. Keen to explore possible metaphysical and ethical implications of socialism, he came to describe a \\"religion of socialism\\" as a means to overcome the dichotomy between the personal and the social, and also that between the cognitive and the emotional. He saw this as a replacement for organised religion, and was a fervent atheist, keen to free workers from what he saw as the moralism of the middle-class. Bax moved to Berlin and worked as a journalist on the Evening Standard. On his return to England in 1882, he joined the SDF, but grew disillusioned and in 1885 left to form the Socialist League with William Morris. After anarchists gained control of the League, he rejoined the SDF, and became the chief theoretician, and editor of the party paper Justice. He opposed the party's participation in the Labour Representation Committee, and eventually persuaded them to leave. Almost throughout his life, he saw economic conditions as ripe for socialism, but felt this progress was delayed by a lack of education of the working class. Bax supported Karl Kautsky over Eduard Bernstein, but Kautsky had little time for what he saw as Bax's utopianism, and supported Theodore Rothstein's efforts to spread a more orthodox Marxism in the SDF. Initially very anti-nationalist, Bax came to support the British in World War I, but by this point he was concentrating on his career as a barrister and did little political work. Historian As well as his contributions to philosophy, men's rights, and socialism, Bax published several in depth historical studies of individuals, and cultures. He records in his Reminiscences that he always felt, from childhood on, the need of an intelligible doctrine of history. Among his historical works are: Jean-Paul Marat: The People's Friend (1879), German Society at the Close of the Middle Ages (1894), The Social Side of the Reformation in Germany (1894), The Peasants‚Äô War in Germany (1899), The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptists (1903), The Last Episode of the French Revolution (1911), and German Culture Past and Present (1913). Works Inside cover of Legal Subjection of Men, first published 1896 He wrote the following books on various subjects: * Jean-Paul Marat: A Historico-Biographical Sketch (1882) * A Handbook of the History of Philosophy (1886) * A Short Account of the Commune of Paris of 1871, with Victor Dave & William Morris (1886) * Religion of Socialism (1886) * The Story of The French Revolution (1890) * Outlooks From a New Standpoint (1891) * The Problem of Reality (1893) * The Ethics of Socialism (1893) * German Society at the Close of The Middle Ages (1894) * A Short History of The Paris Commune (1894) * Socialism; Its Growth and Outcome, with William Morris (1894) * The Legal Subjection of Men (1896 with Twentieth Century Press) with an unnamed Irish barrister, (republished in 1908 with New Age Press). * The Peasants War in Germany (1899) * Jean-Paul Marat: The People's Friend (1901) * The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptists (1900) * A New Catechism of Socialism, with Harry Quelch (1903) * Essays in Socialism, New and Old (1906) * The Roots of Reality (1908) * The Last Episode of the French Revolution: Being a History of Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of the Equals (1911) * Problems of Men, Mind, and Morals (1912) * The Fraud of Feminism (1913) * Reminiscences and Reflexions of a mid and late Victorian (1918) * German Culture Past and Present (1915)  References  External links *Ernest Belfort Bax: Father of the Men's Movement *Archive of Bax's work on Marxists.org The Legal Subjection of Men, 1908 antithesis of John Stuart Mill's 1869 The Subjection of Women. *Fraud of Feminism, full 1913 text online *Article on Bax at Spartacus Educational Category:1854 births Category:1926 deaths Category:British Socialist Party members Category:English atheists Category:English historians Category:English male journalists Category:English philosophers Category:English socialists Category:Freethought writers Category:Male critics of feminism Category:People from Leamington Spa Category:Social Democratic Federation members Category:Socialist League (UK, 1885) members ","title":"Ernest Belfort Bax"},{"id":"397584","text":"A lamb roast and \\"kolo\\" (circle) dancing - Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1895 The culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina encompasses the country's ancient heritage, architecture, literature, visual arts, music, cinema, sports and cuisine. Ancient cultural heritage Kulin Ban's plate found in Biskupiƒái, near Visoko. The rock-carving by an artist found in Badanj Cave near the city of Stolac dates back to Paleolithic times (c. 12,000 and 16,000 BCE). It represents the death of a horse under a rain of arrows. It is the oldest Paleolithic finding in southeast Europe. There is also a rich legacy of Neolithic culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Particularly beautiful items have been found in Butmir near Sarajevo (5000 BC). During the Bronze Age, the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina was occupied by Illyrian tribes such as the Japods in Bihaƒá and the Daors in Daorson, near Stolac. They were directly influenced by the Greeks, as seen in Daorson especially. The Illyrians were conquered by the Romans, who left roads, bridges, and beautiful villas with mosaics all over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The best preserved examples are at Mogorjelo near ƒåapljina and the mosaics at Stolac (dating from the 3rd century). The Christian basilica are found throughout the country (Zenica, Visoko, Mostar, ≈†iroki Brijeg ... ), and their carved stone stonework influenced the first original medieval Bosnian art, found on tombstones ‚Äì steƒáak. The Charter of Ban Kulin is the symbolic birth certificate of Bosnia's statehood, as it is the first written document that refers to Bosnia's borders (between the rivers of Drina, Sava and Una) and the elements of the Bosnian state - the ruler, throne and political organization. It is written in Bosnian Cyrillic and it also referred to the people of Bosnia - Bosnianins. The Charter was a trade agreement between Bosnia and the Republic of Dubrovnik. The most important item in the National Museum in Sarajevo is the Sarajevo Haggadah, a Jewish illuminated codex originally from 12th century Spain. Other important items include Hrvojev's mass (Hrvojev misal) and Hval's Codex (Hvalov zbornik), both Bosnian books of liturgy produced in Croatia at the start of the 15th century, a 16th-century Kur‚Äôan and Leontiev's New Testament (Leontijevo ƒçetverojevanƒëelje). Architecture Literature Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literary heritage. Matija Divkoviƒá, Bosnian Franciscan and writer is considered to be the founder of the modern literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notable poets include Antun Branko ≈†imiƒá, Aleksa ≈†antiƒá, Jovan Duƒçiƒá and Mak Dizdar. Prominent prose writers include the Nobel Literature Prize laureate Ivo Andriƒá, Me≈°a Selimoviƒá, Zaim Topƒçiƒá, Zlatko Topƒçiƒá, Semezdin Mehmedinoviƒá, Aleksandar Hemon, Branko ƒÜopiƒá, Miljenko Jergoviƒá, Isak Samokovlija, Abdulah Sidran, Petar Koƒçiƒá and Ned≈æad Ibri≈°imoviƒá. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was famous playwright Branislav Nu≈°iƒá. Magazines such as Novi Plamen, Most and Sarajevske sveske are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes. Visual arts The visual arts in Bosnia and Herzegovina were always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones (steƒáak) to paintings in Kotromaniƒá court. However, it was the Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1878 that led to the renaissance of Bosnian painting. The first artists trained in European academies emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. These included Gabrijel Jurkiƒá, Petar Tije≈°iƒá, Karlo Mijiƒá, ≈†piro Bocariƒá, Petar ≈†ain, ƒêoko Mazaliƒá, Roman Petroviƒá and Lazar Drljaƒça. Their generation was succeeded by artists such as Ismet Mujezinoviƒá, Vojo Dimitrijeviƒá, Ivo ≈†eremet and Mica Todoroviƒá. Prominent artists in the post-World War II period include Virgilije Nevjestiƒá, Bekir Misirliƒá, Ljubo Lah, Meho Sefiƒá, Franjo Likar, Mersad Berber, Ibrahim Ljuboviƒá, D≈æevad Hozo, Affan Ramiƒá, Safet Zec, Ismar Mujezinoviƒá, and Mehmed Zaimoviƒá. The Ars Aevi museum of contemporary art in Sarajevo includes works by artists renowned worldwide. Music Vedran Smailoviƒá, the cellist of Sarajevo. The most popular traditional Bosnian and Herzogovinian song forms of relatively recent origin (early 20th century) are the Bosnian root music (played with \\"≈°argija\\"), ganga, the rera and the ojkavica (oja-noja).mp3 files with examples from Dalmatia (Croatia) in \\"Trends and Processes in the Music Culture of the Dalmatian Hinterland\\" by Josko Caleta , accessed 15 February 2011 Other popular surviving forms from the Ottoman era is the sevdalinka.

Sarajevo Film Festival, founded in 1995, has become the biggest and most influential in southeast Europe. Sports =Olympics= The most important international sporting event in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the hosting of the 1984 Winter Olympics, held in Sarajevo from the 7th to 19 February 1984. Some notable Bosnian Olympians were: * Rome, 1960: Tomislav Knez and Velimir Sombolac (football), * Munich, 1972: Abaz Arslanagiƒá, Milorad Karaliƒá, Neboj≈°a Popoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Lavriniƒá, and Dobrivoje Seleƒá (handball) * Moscow, 1980: Mirza Deliba≈°iƒá and Ratko Radovanoviƒá (basketball) * Los Angeles, 1984: Zdravko Raƒëenoviƒá, Zlatan Arnautoviƒá (handball) and Anto Josipoviƒá (boxing). Sitting volleyball Bosnia and Herzegovina national sitting volleyball team is the most decorated team representing Bosnia and Herzegovina. The team won 2 Paralympics Gold medals (2004 and 2012) and multiple World and European sitting volleyball titles. Many of the players lost limbs in the 1992-1995 Bosnian War. =Popular sports= Athletics Bosnia and Herzegovina has produced many prominent athletes, including members of the Yugoslav national team before Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The nation's most notable track and field athlete since independence is runner Amel Tuka, who took the bronze medal in the 800 metres at the 2015 World Athletics Championships and the silver medal in the 800 metres at the 2019 World Athletics Championships. Football (soccer) Football is the most popular sport in B&H.; It dates from 1903 but its popularity grew significantly after World War II. In the pre- independence era Sarajevo (1967 and 1984) and ≈Ωeljezniƒçar (1972) both won the Yugoslavian Championship title. The former Yugoslav national football team included a number of Bosnian players, such as Josip Katalinski, Du≈°an Bajeviƒá, Miroslav Bla≈æeviƒá, Ivica Osim, Safet Su≈°iƒá, and Mirsad Fazlagiƒá. Since independence the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team has failed to qualify for any European or World Championship tournament, up until 2014 FIFA World Cup, after winning eight games to secure their place after many years of failed attempts of making their FIFA debut. Bosnian national teams have struggled to field the best eligible team as many players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina choose to play for other countries for reasons of ethnic identification and because of the higher salaries offered by other teams (for example: Mario Staniƒá and Mile Mitiƒá were both born in Bosnia but play for Croatia and Serbia respectively; other internationally famous players from Bosnia and Herzegovina who have made similar choices include Zoran Saviƒá, Vladimir Radmanoviƒá, Zoran Planiniƒá, Aleksandar Nikoliƒá and Savo Milo≈°eviƒá). Basketball Bosnian basketball club, KK Bosna from Sarajevo were European Champions in 1989. The Yugoslav national basketball team, medal-winners in every world championship from 1963 through 1990, included Bosnian players such as Dra≈æen Dalipagiƒá and Mirza Deliba≈°iƒá. Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly qualifies for the Eurobasket championship. The Jedinstvo Women's basketball club, based in Tuzla, won the 1979 European Championships in Florence. Boxing The middle-weight boxer Marjan Bene≈° has won several B&H; Championships, Yugoslavian Championships and the European Championship. In 1978, he won the World Title against Elish Obeda from Bahamas. Another middle-weight, Ante Josipoviƒá, won the Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles in 1984. He also won the Yugoslavian Championship in 1982, the Championship of the Balkans in 1983 and the Beograd Trophy in 1985. Felix Sturm aka Adnan Catic is a German former middleweightchampion boxer with Bosnian origin. He has a Bosnian flag in his weardrobe and often holdes tales in Bosnian after a boxing match. Chess The Bosnian chess team has been Champion of Yugoslavia seven times, in addition to winning four European championships: 1994 in Lyon, 1999 in Bugojno, 2000 in Neum, and 2001 in Kalitea. The Borki Predojeviƒá chess club (from Tesliƒá) has also won two European Club Championships, at Litohoreu (Greece) in 1999, and Kalitei (Greece) in 2001. Handball The Borac handball club, seven times Yugoslav National Championship winners, won the European Championship Cup in 1976 and the International Handball Federation Cup in 1991. Karate The Tuzla- Sinalco karate club from Tuzla was the most prolific Yugoslav championship- winning team, also winning four European Championships and one World Championship. Other Cuisine Bosnian ƒáevapi with onions in a somun. Bosnian cuisine reflects a balance of Western and Eastern influences. Due to almost 500 years of Ottoman rule, Bosnian food is closely related to Turkish, Greek, and other former Ottoman and Mediterranean cuisines. However, years of Austrian rule can be detected in the many influences from Central Europe. Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, but usually in very small quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are boiled; the sauces are completely natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, spinach, courgettes, dried beans, fresh beans, plums, milk, and cream called pavlaka. Typical meat dishes include primarily chicken, beef and mutton. Some local specialties are ƒáevapi, burek, dolma, sarma, pilaf, goulash, ajvar and an extensive range of Eastern sweets. The best local wine comes from the southern region of the country, Herzegovina, where the climate is particularly suitable for growing grapes. Plum or apple rakia is distilled in the northern region of Bosnia.

He was also noted as a prominent atheist, nationalist and opponent of eugenics. In the early 1920s, after the death of his wife, he turned towards spiritualism. Early life Blatchford was born 17 March 1851 in Maidstone, Kent. His parents ‚Äì John Glanville Blatchford, a strolling comedian, and Georgina Louisa Corri (maiden; 1821‚Äì1890), an actress ‚Äì named him after the conservative Prime Minister Robert Peel who died the year before. His great- grandfather, by way of his mother, Domenico Corri (1746‚Äì1825), was an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late 18th century, moved from Rome to Edinburgh to teach music. One of his grandnieces, Christine Glanville (1924‚Äì1999), was an acclaimed English puppeteer. Blatchford's father died in 1853, leaving him in the care of his mother. She continued her acting career for nine years, and Blatchford spent much of his early life close to the stage. To help support the family, Blatchford and his brother Montagu would perform with their mother, doing comedic renditions and dances for extra income. In 1862 the family moved to Halifax, where it was hoped that Blatchford and his brother could learn a trade. Blatchford was first employed as an odd job boy in a lithographic printing works, for which he earned a salary of eighteen pence a week. As a child he attended school only occasionally, firstly in Halifax and later in Portsmouth. Despite the brevity of his educational experience, it provided him with enough insight that he called the education system a 'cram' method. Though lacking a formal education, Blatchford taught himself from the age of eight, reading the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress, and the works of Charles Dickens. Throughout his childhood he was frail and sickly, and doctors suggested that he would not reach adulthood. This illness gave Blatchford time to read, something he would not have been able to pursue as thoroughly if employed. Around 1864, Georgina secured full-time employment as a dressmaker and immediately apprenticed both her sons, sending Montagu to a lithographic printer and Robert to a brushmaker. At the brushmaker factory, Blatchford met Sarah Crossley, whom he would marry in 1880. By 1871 Blatchford left Halifax, though his reason for doing so has been the cause of debate. Laurence Thomson argues that the departure was due to a quarrel with his mother, but Blatchford's daughter Dorothea maintains that his decision to leave was caused by the difficulty of his life in Halifax. On May Day 1871, Blatchford walked to Hull, then continued on to London via Yarmouth. Military and early journalistic career After leaving Halifax, Blatchford joined the Army and rose to become a sergeant major by 1874. By the time of his promotion, he had also achieved the Army's second class certificate of education. Blatchford served with the Irish regiment 103rd Dublin Fusiliers and the 96th Regiment of Foot. The pleasures of army life stimulated some of Blatchford's best writing, but in 1877 he left the army to become a clerk in the Weaver Navigation Company. While employed as a clerk, he carefully used his spare time to learn grammar, syntax, and shorthand. In 1880 he married Sarah Crossley, whom he met in Halifax, at the Zion Chapel in Halifax; they then settled in Norwich. Sarah was the daughter of a domestic servant and a mechanic. Around this time Blatchford became frustrated with his job, and decided that he wished to become an artist. Because employment opportunities for artists in Norwich were scarce, however, he instead decided to become a writer. Blatchford's writing career began in 1882 at the Yorkshireman newspaper, where he had a sketch published. He obtained his first full-time writing job through his friend Alexander Muttock Thompson, who worked for the Manchester Sporting Chronicle. Thompson recommended Blatchford to a friend who ran the newspaper Bell's Life in London. A year later, Blatchford moved his family to South London to write for Bell's Life and the Leeds Toby. In 1885, Blatchford began to write for the Manchester Sunday Chronicle. When Bell's Life failed two years later, he moved to a full-time position at the Sunday Chronicle. Before beginning at the Sunday Chronicle, Blatchford took a short holiday on the Isle of Wight after the death of his two children. At this time he had not begun to espouse socialist views, but the societal reactions to the competitiveness of industrial society in Northern England began affecting his sentiments. The largest political influence on Blatchford was the South Salford Social Democratic Federation. This change is seen in a series of 1889 articles he wrote for the Sunday Chronicle which denounced the housing conditions in Manchester and organised two working men's Sanitary Organisations in the area. Reflecting back on this period, Blatchford stated in the Fortnightly Review in 1907 that \\"Dr. Cozier is mistaken if he thinks I took my Socialism from Marx, or that it depends upon the Marxian theory of value. I have never read a page of Marx. I got the idea of collective ownership from H. M. Hyndman; the rest of my Socialism I thought out myself. English Socialism is not German: it is English. English Socialism is not Marxian; it is humanitarian. It does not depend upon any theory of 'economic justice' but upon humanity and common sense.\\" The Clarion In 1890, while based in Manchester, Blatchford became actively involved in the Labour Movement. He founded the Manchester branch of the Fabian Society, and launched a weekly socialist newspaper, The Clarion, in 1891. Later that year, he used his column to announce that he had accepted the invitation of the Bradford Labour Union to become the Independent Labour candidate in Bradford East. However, his socialist stance forced him to leave the Sunday Chronicle, which in turn left him with a severe reduction in income. Having left the newspaper on 12 December 1891, Blatchford set up The Clarion, but a printing error made its first edition was almost completely illegible. Nevertheless, it still sold at least 40,000 copies. It continued to sell this number and more during the following years. By 1910 it was selling about 80,000 copies of each issue. Bernard Semmel described it as \\"the most successful socialist publication in Great Britain during the period before the war of 1914\\".Semmel, p. 214. By 1892 Blatchford had removed himself from the candidature in Bradford East and began siding with the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) against the Fabians' policy of \\"permeation.\\" The joining of The Clarion and SDF resulted in the formation in 1892 of the Manchester Independent Labour Party, which soon devised the Manchester Fourth Clause. By 1893 Blatchford was the leader of his own clique within the newly founded national Independent Labour Party, the Clarionettes, whose extraordinary dynamism was expressed in its numerous choral societies, Clarion cycling clubs, Socialist Scouts, and glee clubs. Central to the Clarion movement were the Clarion cycling clubs, whose members, frequently accompanied by the \\"Clarion Van\\", travelled the country distributing socialist literature and holding mass meetings. Robert Tressell's socialist novel The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists contains a detailed account based on a meeting organised by the Clarion scouts. The Clarion movement also supported many industrial disputes at this time, including the three-year lockout of the slateworkers of the Penrhyn slate quarry in North Wales. The Clarion collected ¬£1,500 to support the people of Bethesda. There was a revolt in the county federation created by the ILP in 1894, as Blatchford urged the formation of a united socialist party. In the same year he resigned from the editorship of The Clarion due to ill health and developed depression. He started to edit it again in 1896. He supported the Boer War, which lost him support from some sections of the labour movement. Blatchford denounced his \\"cosmopolitan friends, who are so cosmopolitan that they can admire every country but their own, and love all men except Englishmen\\".Semmel, p. 217. He criticised the \\"smug, self-righteous prigs\\" in the labour movement who, while \\"despising military glory, are yet so eloquent over the marksmanship and courage of the Boers\\". He wrote that his \\"whole heart is with the British troops ... When England is at war, I'm English. I have no politics and no party. I am English.\\"Semmel, p. 218. Responding to claims from the right-wing press that he wanted to ‚Äòturn people against their country‚Äô, he retorted that he wanted ‚Äòto make people so fond of their country that they shall desire to possess it‚Äô. After the war Blatchford continued to agitate for a united socialist party and supported the London Progressive Party. He was critical of the Labour Party, which was founded in 1900, for what he perceived as its complete subservience to Liberalism, especially in its Cobdenite internationalist views on foreign policy.Semmel, p. 215. Blatchford said of himself and his colleagues at The Clarion: \\"We were out for Socialism and nothing but Socialism, and we were Britons first and Socialists next.\\"Blatchford, p. 199. Blatchford criticised free trade from an economic nationalist perspective. Free trade had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture. This was especially serious in wartime because Britain could be starved into submission due to the dependence for her food on foreign nations. When Joseph Chamberlain launched his crusade for Tariff Reform in 1903, Blatchford's response was ambiguous. He did not formally endorse Chamberlain's campaign, but The Clarion praised his aims‚Äîthe revival of British agriculture, a self-sufficient Empire, and producer-focused instead of consumer-focused economic system.Semmel, p. 219. Blatchford said he did not believe in tariff reform as applied by Conservatives, but that a socialist government would find it a necessary instrument.Semmel, p. 220. A further development in Blatchford's thinking cost him further readers, when he began denouncing organised religion in such works as God and My Neighbour in 1903 and ‚ÄòNot Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog‚Äô 1905. Again, to antagonise the ILP, the Clarion raised funds for Victor Grayson, whom the ILP had declined to support. He justified his attacks as being because Labour was too close to the Liberals. Merrie England A series of articles on socialism in The Clarion were published in book form in 1893 as Merrie England. The first edition sold 30,000 copies. The year after, a pocket-sized edition was published, which sold 25,000 copies.Thompson, p. 98. A penny edition was published in 1894, with 250,000 copies being ordered before publication and within a year 750,000 copies had been despatched across the English speaking world.Thompson, p. 99. In Britain and America, the book sold over two million copies. In the opinion of Robert Ensor, the book \\"helped to make socialism really well known in England for the first time...It was Blatchford's highest flight as a propagandist; he never surpassed it, and through it mainly he left his mark upon history\\".R. C. K. Ensor, ‚ÄòBlatchford, Robert Peel Glanville (1851‚Äì1943)‚Äô, rev. H. C. G. Matthew, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 13 January 2014. The book was translated into Welsh, Hebrew, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and German.Thompson, p. 101. William Thomas Stead picked the book as the Review of Reviews book of the month and called Blatchford \\"the poor man's Plato\\".Thompson, p. 100. Dr Horton the Congregationalist minister compared Blatchford to Isaiah, Amos and Micah and said that \\"if Jesus Christ were a man on earth today, He would read the book not only with interest but with approval, and He would say to any officious disciples who took exception to parts of it, ‚ÄúForbid him not; he that is not against Me is for Me‚Äù.\\" C. P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian wrote to Blatchford, saying: \\"I have been reading Merrie England and (pace the reviewers) find a great deal in it!\\" The Manchester Guardian said that for every British convert to socialism made by Das Kapital there were a hundred made by Merrie England. At the Oxford Union a motion was approved by 103 to 54 that stated that \\"the aims of the Socialist tract, Merrie England, are but the baseless fabric of a vision\\". The motion was seconded by Hilaire Belloc.Thompson, pp. 100-101. Blatchford was a vegetarian and in Merrie England he mentioned the economic, health and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian diet.Li, Chien-hui. (2019). Mobilizing Traditions in the First Wave of the British Animal Defense Movement. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 107. War scare of 1909 At the end of the second week of December 1909, Blatchford wrote ten daily articles for the Daily Mail warning of the German menace: > I write these articles because I believe that Germany is deliberately > preparing to destroy the British Empire; and because I know that we are not > ready or able to defend ourselves against a sudden and formidable > attack...At the present moment the whole country is in a ferment about the > Budget and the Peers and the Election. It seems sheer criminal lunacy to > waste time and strength in chasing such political bubble when the existence > of the Empire is threatened.Morris, p. 213. The articles received considerable attention in Britain and Germany, and when published as a pamphlet sold over one and a half million copies. The King \\"lamented Blatchford's violence\\"Morris, p. 213 and the Kaiser read Blatchford's articles with care and denounced them as \\"very mischievous and singularly ill-timed\\".Morris, p. 423, p. 219. Sir Charles Ottley, the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote to Lord Esher that Blatchford's appeal was not based on a partisan, political basis as he had said that the country did not want a Liberal or Unionist government but a MAN: \\"His strength is that he knows what he wants and is not afraid to ask for it in plain language...The burthen of the song is‚Äîcompulsory service, a strong navy and a general raising of the standard of education and living of the masses of the British people\\".Morris, p. 214. Lord Cromer publicly declared that he shared Blatchford's patriotism.Morris, p. 216. The articles ensured that defence was a major issue in the ensuing general election of January 1910.Morris, p. 215. After the election the Liberal MP Reginald McKenna boasted that Blatchford had not cost the Liberals a single vote.Blatchford, p. 224.Thompson, p. 216. Keir Hardie said that \\"the whole Socialist movement was rocking with suppressed laughter\\".Blatchford, p. 225. The Daily Mail‚Ä≤s Berlin correspondent told Lord Northcliffe: \\"In a long experience...I do not recall a foreign journalistic event which so focussed the attention of the German press and public\\". There was universal condemnation in German newspapers, including Social Democratic, Catholic and Pan-German organs. When the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg complained to Edward Goschen, the British ambassador in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey advised Goschen to explain the articles as \\"not really anti-German but alarmist...to create a scare\\". Shortly before the general election of December 1910, the Daily Mail published Blatchford's series of articles on ‚ÄòThe Greatest Issue of All‚Äô, the German threat. However these were nowhere near as influential as his previous ones and defence was not an issue in the election.Morris, p. 221. In 1909 he began advocating conscription but in 1912 troops were used for strike breaking and Blatchford turned against it: \\"Universal military service under the (present) ruling classes would result in slavery. I regard invasion as the lesser evil\\". However he supported conscription again in 1915, and proclaimed it should be implemented along with the \\"conscription of wealth\\".Thompson, p. 215 + n. Before the Great War, Blatchford toured Germany and after he returned to England he wrote: > I am convinced that...they will be plunged into war without their will. I > like Germany; I like German cities; and I like the German people. But I > believe that the rulers of the German people are deliberately and cynically > preparing to hurl them into a wicked and a desperate war of conquest...The > Germans cannot prevent that war, because they do not believe it is coming. > The British could prevent that war if, before it is too late, they could be > really convinced that it is coming. That is why I want to convince them that > war is coming, because I want to prevent that horrible war.Thompson, p. 213. Blatchford was impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: \\"You don't see anything like that in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?\\"Thompson, p. 214. Later life On 4 August 1914, Blatchford wrote to his friend Alexander Thompson: \\"I shall write today a cautious article counselling peace and suggesting that Sir E. Grey should ask Russia and Germany to suspend hostilities pending a friendly mediation by America, England and Italy, or any one of those powers. But I do not think really that European peace is possible until Germany has been defeated and humiliated. And I realise the great possibility that we shall be at war with Germany before the Clarion comes out. And I hope we are\\".Thompson, pp. 222‚Äì223. The Clarion Movement was split when Blatchford swung his paper in support of the British participation in the First World War. The circulation for The Clarion fell by 10,000 in a week but when in September 1914 Blatchford wrote a page of The Weekly Dispatch every Sunday its circulation rose by 50,000.Thompson, p. 223. In his first article for that paper, Blatchford correctly predicted that the German Army would not reach Paris and of General Joffre's flank along the Marne. Blatchford visited France in October 1914 and was shocked by the conduct of the Germans in waging war. Initially warning his readers of fake atrocity stories, Blatchford was shocked by the ruined villages in France and the stories he heard, \\"too horrible and too unclean to be revealed in print\\". He wrote to Thompson in 1933: \\"In the early days of the war the movement howled with indignation about the lying charges brought against the German General Staff and troops. The noble Germans were incapable of such crimes. British and Belgian and American witnesses were all liars. Today the same intelligent comrades are denouncing the atrocities committed by the Nazi 'storm troops' upon innocent and helpless Jews. Well, old pal, may I suggest that if the Germans of today are guilty perhaps the Huns of 1914 were not quite innocent\\". In his articles during the war, Blatchford campaigned for better pay for the soldiers and considerable pensions for disabled soldiers, soldiers' widows and children.Thompson, p. 224, p. 226. When a soldier wrote to him, claiming his opinions would not be accepted by the Army but those of Philip Snowden and Ramsay MacDonald would, Blatchford replied: \\"I am sorry. I cannot help it. You want peace. But you cannot have peace without victory...The struggle with Germany will not end with the present war, and we may some day have to fight Germany single- handed\\".Thompson, p. 226. In 1915, Blatchford formed the National Democratic and Labour Party (NDP) as a splinter from the right wing of the British Socialist Party and for the 1918 General Election, the NDP stood in 18 constituencies and won 9 members of Parliament with 156,834 votes. It thereby became the first party formed by a right-wing split from the Labour party in Britain to win seats in Parliament at a general election. Blatchford's wife died in 1921, and later he took an interest in Spiritualism. In 1923 he wrote in response to claims in the press that he had been converted away from socialism by reading Henry Ford's autobiography: > I have never been converted from Socialism. But careful observation of the > facts of for the last twelve years or so has convinced me that Socialism > will not work, and a study of Mr. Ford's methods has provided what seems to > me as good a substitute as we may hope in this imperfect world. Socialism as > I knew it in past years was an excellent, almost a perfect, theory...The > golden rule will not work in international politics, because the nations are > not good enough to live up to it. Real Socialism strongly resembles real > Christianity. It is a counsel of perfection and cannot be adopted and > adhered to by our imperfect humanity. There is nothing the matter with > Socialism, but the people are neither wise enough nor good enough to make it > a success. Socialism implies the self-abnegation of the individual for the > good of the community.Thompson, pp. 229‚Äì230. When the first Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, took office in 1924, Blatchford responded to Thompson's enthusiasm: \\"I don't like their policy and I don't trust them. They are in no sense Socialists. At present they are Liberals and we shall have a blend of Liberal shibboleths and communist insanity\\".Thompson, p. 230. When Sir Edward Hulton sold most of his newspapers to Lord Rothermere, Blatchford wrote a letter to The Morning Post: > As a protest against the attempt of the syndicated newspapers to muzzle the > press and dictate to the Government, I have resigned my position on The > Sunday Chronicle and The Sunday Herald...the public should be helped to > realise that the political judgments of the syndicated newspapers are not > sincere and considered opinions of trained, independent thinkers, but the > broadcast railings of one rich man in a panic over the Capital Levy. It is > important that this should be said, and that the country should understand > that the voice of Lord Rothermere is not the voice of public opinion. His > standardised newspapers are journalistic tied houses, where proprietorial > dope is sold as honest beer.Thompson, p. 232. Blatchford voted Conservative in 1924. However, his later books indicate a continued faith in his own English version of socialism. Moreover, the Clarion Movement carried on as a socialist popular movement, taking its cue from Blatchford, into the 1930s and beyond, as indicated by the continued existence of the Clarion rambling and cycling clubs and the founding of the newspaper The New Clarion in 1932. In a 1931 letter to Alexander Thompson, Blatchford proclaimed his last political credo, his language remaining fiery and eloquent: > I have always been a Tory Democrat...You remember that from the first the > Clarion crowd and the Hardie crowd were out of harmony ... I loathe the > ‚Äútop-hatted, frock-coated magnolia-scented‚Äù snobocracy as much as you do; > but I cannot away with the Keir Hardies and Arthur Hendersons and Ramsay > MacDonalds and Bernard Shaws and Maxtons. Not long ago you told me in a > letter of some trade union delegates who were smoking cigars and drinking > whisky at the House of Commons at the expense of their unions. You liked > them not. Nor do I like the Trade Union bigots who have cheated J. H. Thomas > of his pension...I am glad the Labour Party is defeated because I believe > they would have disrupted the British Empire. I dreaded their childish > cosmopolitanism; their foolish faith that we could abolish crime by reducing > the police force. All the other nations are out for their own ends. American > enthusiasm for Naval Disarmament is not dictated by a love of peace. It is > an expression of naval rivalry. All the nations hated our naval supremacy. > Do the Americans love us? Do the French love us? Is France, America, Italy, > devoted to an unselfish and human peace? Can we dispel the bellicose > sentiments of Russia and China and Japan by sending an old pantaloon to talk > platitudes at Geneva, or by disbanding the Horse Guards and scrapping a few > submarines?...The England of my affection and devotion is not a country nor > a people: it is a tradition, the finest tradition the world has ever > produced. The Labour Party do not subscribe to that tradition; do not know > it; could not feel it. And if that tradition is to survive, the policy of > scuttle and surrender must be abandoned. You agree with all this I feel > sure. You always upheld the Pax Britannica. We have not drifted apart, old > pal: our separation is only geographical.Thompson, pp. 230‚Äì231. After Adolf Hitler became German Chancellor in 1933, Blatchford \\"began to smell brimstone\\", in the words of his biographer Laurence Thompson. Blatchford said: \\"The people ought to know; but who will let me say what ought to be said?\\" Blatchford feared that people would say: \\"Oh, Blatchford. He has Germany on the brain.\\"Thompson, p. 233. When Winston Churchill began warning of the dangers of Nazi Germany, Blatchford remarked: \\"Ha! He's learning! Now watch him get it in the neck\\". Later on, Blatchford believed Churchill's conduct redeemed what he considered his past political errors. On 17 December 1943, Blatchford died in Horsham, Sussex at the age of 92. Legacy Blatchford's 'love of country' themes were not a late aberration but can be found throughout his output. His combination of libertarianism, socialism and conservatism mark him out as one of the more original activists in English political history. The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, said of Blatchford in his autobiography: > In these years Mr. Blatchford gave invaluable help to Socialist propaganda. > No man did more than he to make Socialism understood by the ordinary working > man. His writings in them had nothing of economic abstruseness. He based his > appeal on the principles of human justice. He preached Socialism as a system > of industrial co-operation for the common good. His arguments and > illustrations were drawn from facts and experiences within the knowledge of > the common people. Socialism as he taught it was not a cold, materialistic > theory, but the promise of a new life as full, sweet and noble as the world > can give...Mr. Blatchford is still living, hale and hearty, his mental > powers undiminished at the ripe age of eighty-three. I saw him recently, and > we talked of those grand and inspiring times of forty years ago. Only the > men who were in the Socialist movement in those days can know the great part > Robert Blatchford took in making it popular, and of the personal devotion he > inspired by his writings.Philip, Viscount Snowden, An Autobiography. Volume > One. 1864‚Äì1919 (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), pp. 58‚Äì59. The General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress from 1925 to 1946, Sir Walter Citrine, was influenced by Blatchford's writings. He said of Britain for the British: \\"I found it a cogent and reasoned argument for Socialism. It was written with a clearness and bite which were unusual\\".Lord Citrine, Men and Work. An Autobiography (London: Hutchinson, 1964), p. 62. Clement Attlee also spoke of Blatchford's influence on his beliefs. A. J. P. Taylor said that Blatchford was \\"the greatest popular journalist since Cobbett\\".A. J. P. Taylor, Essays in English History (London: Pelican, 1976), p. 174.

While he was working as a schoolteacher in Leeds he pursued various interests, including Plato, the Independent Labour Party and theosophy. In 1900 he met Holbrook Jackson and three years later they co-founded the Leeds Arts Club, which became a centre of modernist culture in Britain. In 1905 Orage resigned his teaching position and moved to London. There, in 1907, he bought and began editing the weekly The New Age, at first with Holbrook Jackson, and became an influential figure in socialist politics and modernist culture, especially at the height of the magazine's fame before the First World War. In 1924 Orage sold The New Age and went to France to work with George Gurdjieff, the spiritual teacher whom P. D. Ouspensky had recommended to him. After spending some time on preliminary training in the Gurdjieff System Orage was sent to America by Gurdjieff himself to raise funds and lecture on the new system of self-development, which emphasised the harmonious work of intellectual, emotional and moving functions. Orage also worked with Gurdjieff in translating the first version of Gurdjieff's All and Everything as well as Meetings with Remarkable Men from Russian to English, but neither book was ever published in their lifetimes. In 1927 Orage's first wife, Jean, granted him a divorce and in September he married Jessie Richards Dwight (1901‚Äì1985), the co-owner of the Sunwise Turn bookshop where Orage first lectured on the Gurdjieff System. Orage and Jessie had two children, Richard and Ann. While they were in New York Orage and Jessie often catered to celebrities such as Paul Robeson, fresh from his London tour. In 1930 Orage returned to England and in 1931 he began publishing the New English Weekly. He remained in London until his death on 6 November 1934. Early life James Alfred Orage was born in Dacre, near Harrogate in the West Riding of Yorkshire, into a Nonconformist family. He was generally known as Dickie, and he eventually dropped the name James and adopted the middle name Richard. In 1894 he became a schoolteacher in an elementary school in Leeds and helped to found the Leeds branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He wrote a weekly literary column for the ILP's paper, the Labour Leader, from 1895 to 1897. He brought a philosophical outlook to the paper, including in particular the thought of Plato and Edward Carpenter. Orage devoted seven years of study to Plato, from 1893 to 1900. He also devoted seven years of his life to the study of Nietzsche's philosophy, from 1900 to 1907, and from 1907 to 1914 he was a student of the Mahabharata.The Purchase of The New Age p. 17 By the late 1890s Orage was disillusioned with conventional socialism and turned for a while to theosophy. In 1900 he met Holbrook Jackson in a Leeds bookshop and lent him a copy of the Bhagavad-Gita. In return Jackson lent him Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which led Orage to study Nietzsche's work in depth. In 1903 Orage, Jackson and the architect Arthur J. Penty helped to found the Leeds Arts Club with the intention of promoting the work of radical thinkers including G. B. Shaw, whom Orage had met in 1898, Henrik Ibsen and Nietzsche. During this period Orage returned to socialist platforms, but by 1906 he was determined to combine Carpenter's socialism with Nietzsche's thought and theosophy. In 1906 Beatrice Hastings, whose real name was Emily Alice Haigh and who hailed from Port Elizabeth, became a regular contributor to the New Age. By 1907 she and Orage had developed an intimate relationship. As Beatrice Hastings herself later put it, ‚Ä≥Aphrodite amused herself at our expense.‚Ä≥ Orage's involvement with Beatrice Hastings was too much for Orage's wife Jean, who had shared his theosophical and aesthetic interests until then. She went to live with Holbrook Jackson and spent the rest of her life as a skilled craftswoman in the tradition of William Morris. Orage explored his new ideas in several books. He saw Nietzsche's √úbermensch as a metaphor for the \\"higher state of consciousness\\" sought by mystics and attempted to define a route to this higher state, insisting that it must involve a rejection of civilisation and conventional morality. He moved through a celebration of Dionysus to declare that he was in favour, not of an ordered socialism, but of an anarchic movement. In 1906 and 1907 Orage published three books: Consciousness: Animal, Human and Superhuman, based on his experience with theosophy; Friedrich Nietzsche: The Dionysian Spirit of the Age; and Nietzsche in Outline and Aphorism. Orage's rational critique of theosophy evoked an editorial rebuttal from The Theosophical Review and in 1907 he terminated his association with the Theosophical Society. The two books on Nietzsche were the first systematic introductions to Nietzschean thought to be published in Britain. Editor in London In 1906 Orage resigned his teaching post and moved to London, following Arthur Penty, another friend from the Leeds Art Club. In London Orage attempted to form a league for the restoration of the guild system, in the spirit of the decentralised socialism of William Morris. The failure of this project spurred him to buy the weekly magazine The New Age in 1907, in partnership with Holbrook Jackson and with the support of George Bernard Shaw. Orage transformed the magazine to fit with his conception of a forum for politics, literature and the arts. Although many contributors were Fabians, he distanced himself from their politics to some extent and sought to have the magazine represent a wide range of political views. He used the magazine to launch attacks on parliamentary politics and argued the need for utopianism. He also attacked the trade union leadership, while offering some support to syndicalism, and tried to combine syndicalism with his ideal of a revived guild system. Combining these two ideas resulted in Guild socialism, the political philosophy Orage began to argue for from about 1910, though the specific term \\"guild socialism\\" seems not to have been mentioned in print until Bertrand Russell referred to it in his book Political Ideals (1917). Between 1908 and 1914 The New Age was the premier little magazine in Britain. It was instrumental in pioneering the British avant-garde, from vorticism to imagism, and its contributors included T.E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, Katherine Mansfield, Ezra Pound and Herbert Read. Orage's success as an editor was connected with his talent as a conversationalist and a ‚Ä≥bringer together‚Ä≥ of people. The modernists of London had been scattered between 1905 and 1910, but largely thanks to Orage a sense of a modernist ‚Ä≥movement‚Ä≥ was created from 1910 onwards.Rooms in the Darwin Hotel pp. 98-127 Orage's politics Orage declared himself a socialist and followed Georges Sorel in arguing that trade unions should pursue an increasingly aggressive policy on wage deals and working conditions. He approved of the increasing militancy of the unions in the era before the First World War and seems to have shared Sorel's belief in the necessity of a union-led General Strike leading to a revolutionary situation. However, for Orage economic power precedes political power, and political reform was useless without economic reform. In the early issues of The New Age Orage supported the women's suffrage movement, but he became increasingly hostile to it as the Women's Social and Political Union became more prominent and more militant. Pro-suffragette articles were not published after 1910, but heated debate on this subject took place in the correspondence columns. During the First World War Orage defended what he saw as the interests of the working class. On 6 August 1914 he wrote in Notes of the Week in The New Age: ‚Ä≥We believe that England is necessary to Socialism, as Socialism is necessary to the world.‚Ä≥ On 14 November 1918 Orage wrote of the coming peace settlement (embodied in the Treaty of Versailles): \\"The next world war, if unhappily there should be another, will in all probability be contained within the clauses and conditions attaching to the present peace settlement.\\" By then Orage was convinced that the hardships of the working class were the result of the monetary policies of banks and governments. If Britain could remove the pound from the gold standard during the war and re- establish the gold standard after the war, then the gold standard was not as necessary as the monetary oligarchs wanted the proletariat to believe it was. On 15 July 1920 Orage wrote: ‚Ä≥We should be the first to admit that the subject of Money is difficult to understand. It is 'intended' to be, by the minute oligarchy that governs the world by means of it.\\" After the First World War Orage was influenced by C. H. Douglas and became a supporter of the social credit movement. On 2 January 1919 Orage published the first article by C. H. Douglas to appear in The New Age: ‚Ä≥A Mechanical View of Economics‚Ä≥. With Gurdjieff Orage had met P. D. Ouspensky for the first time in 1914. Ouspensky's ideas had left a lasting impression and when he moved to London in 1921 Orage began attending his lectures on \\"Fragments of an Unknown Teaching\\", the basis of his book In Search of the Miraculous. From this time onwards Orage became less and less interested in literature and art, and instead focused most of his attention on mysticism. His correspondence with Harry Houdini on this subject moved him to explore ideas of the afterlife. He returned to the idea that there are absolute truths and concluded that they are embodied in the Mahabharata. In February 1922 Ouspensky introduced Orage to G. I. Gurdjieff. Orage sold The New Age and moved to Paris to study at the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. In 1924 Gurdjieff appointed him to lead study groups in the United States, which he did for seven years. Soon after Gurdjieff arrived in New York from France, on 13 November 1930, he deposed Orage and disbanded his study groups, believing that Orage had been teaching them incorrectly: they had been working under the misconception that self-observation could be practised in the absence of self-remembering or in the presence of negative emotions. Members were allowed to continue their studies with Gurdjieff himself, after taking an oath not to communicate with Orage. Upon hearing that Orage had also signed the oath Gurdjieff wept. Gurdjieff had once considered Orage as a friend and brother, and thought of Jessie as a bad choice for a mate. Orage was a chain smoker and Jessie was a heavy drinker. In the privately published Third Series of his writings Gurdjieff wrote of Orage and his wife Jessie: ‚Ä≥his romance had ended in his marrying the saleswoman of 'Sunwise Turn,' a young American pampered out of all proportion to her position...‚Ä≥ Orage, Ouspensky and C. Daly King emphasised certain aspects of the Gurdjieff System while ignoring others. According to Gurdjieff, Orage emphasised self-observation. In Harlem, New York City, Jean Toomer, one of Orage's students at Greenwich Village used Gurdjieff's work to confront the problem of racism. The Orages sailed back to New York from England on the S.S. Washington on 29 December 1930, and arrived on Thursday 8 January 1931. The next day, while they were staying at the Irving Hotel, Orage wrote a letter to Gurdjieff unveiling a plan for the publication of All and Everything before the end of the year and promising a substantial amount of money. At lunch in New York City on 21 February 1931 Achmed Abdulla, a.k.a. Nadir Kahn, told the Orages that he had met Gurdjieff in Tibet and that Gurdjieff had been known there as Lama Dordjieff, a Tsarist agent and tutor to the Dalai Lama. Last years In London Orage became involved in politics again through the social credit movement. He returned to New York on 8 January 1931 in an attempt to meet Gurdjieff's new demands, but he told his wife that he would not be teaching the Gurdjieff System to any group past the end of the Spring. Orage was on the pier on 13 March 1931 to bid Gurdjieff farewell on his way back to France and the Orages sailed back to England on 3 July. In April 1932 Orage founded a new journal, The New English Weekly. Dylan Thomas's first published poem, And Death Shall Have No Dominion, appeared in its issue dated 18 May 1933, but by then the magazine was not selling well and Orage was experiencing financial difficulties. In September 1933 Jessie gave birth to a daughter, Ann. In January 1934 Senator Bronson M. Cutting presented Orage's Social Credit Plan to the United States Senate, proposing that it become one of the tools of Roosevelt's economic policy. At the beginning of August 1934 Gurdjieff asked Orage to prepare a new edition of The Herald of Coming Good. On 20 August Orage wrote his last letter to Gurdjieff: \\"Dear Mr Gurdjieff, I've found very little to revise ...\\" Towards the end of his life Orage was attacked by severe pain below the heart. This ailment had been diagnosed a couple of years before as simply functional and he did not again seek medical advice. While he was broadcasting a speech, \\"Property in Plenty\\", once again expounding the doctrine of social credit, he experienced excruciating pain, but he continued as if nothing was happening. After leaving the studio he spent the evening with his wife and friends, and made plans to see the doctor next day, but he died in his sleep that night.Philip Mairet A. R.

It is located in West Hollywood, California, at 8433 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip. An associated club is located in La Jolla, San Diego, California. History The Comedy Store was opened in April 1972 by comedians Sammy Shore (1927‚Äì2019), and Rudy De Luca. The building was formerly the home of Ciro's, a popular Hollywood nightclub owned by William Wilkerson, and later a rock and roll venue, where The Byrds were discovered in 1964. When the venue reopened as The Comedy Store in 1972, it included a 99-seat theatre. As a result of a divorce settlement, Sammy Shore's ex-wife Mitzi Shore began operating the club in 1973, and she was able to buy the building in 1976. She immediately renovated and expanded the club to include a 450-seat main room. In 1974, The Comedy Store hosted the wedding reception of newlyweds Liza Minnelli and Jack Haley, Jr.. The Comedy Club signage was covered, for the evening, by signs reading \\"Ciro's\\", denoting the venue's prior identity. The event was attended by many dozens of Hollywood glitterati, including Elizabeth Taylor, Sammy Davis Jr., Cher, Bob Fosse, Johnny Carson, Goldie Hawn, Cesar Romero, Priscilla Presley and other stars, past and present. The soiree was so grand that Sunset Boulevard was temporarily blocked by police to allow Hollywood royalty to arrive in their limos unmolested by photographers and reporters. Job action Beginning in 1979, The Comedy Store served for many years as the host location for the annual HBO Young Comedians specials. Also in 1979, stand-up comedians formed a short-lived labor union and demanded to be paid for their appearances at The Comedy Store. For six weeks (beginning in March), several famous comedians staged a protest in front of the club, while others crossed the picket line. The comedians involved formed a union called Comedians for Compensation and fought for pay where they had received none before. They eventually picketed in front of the club when their demands were not met. Jay Leno and David Letterman were among those on the picket line while Garry Shandling and Yakov Smirnoff crossed the line. The job action was not legally a strike as the comedians were classified as \\"independent contractors\\" and were not under contract with the club. Mitzi Shore argued that the club was and had always been a showcase and training ground for young comedians and was not about profits. She alleged that comedians came to the club and could work on their material in front of casting agents and other talent scouts who would possibly hire them as professionals if they were good enough. The comedians at the club became unhappy when the club was expanded several times and it was perceived that Shore's profits were quite substantial. Shore also paid the rest of her staff, including waitresses and bartenders. After the strike, some comedians were no longer allowed to perform at the club, including Steve Lubetkin, who committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the Continental Hyatt House next door. His suicide note included the line: \\"My name is Steve Lubetkin. I used to work at The Comedy Store.\\" Lubetkin hoped that his suicide would resolve the labor dispute. He also cited Shore as the reason he no longer had a job. The union ceased to exist in 1980, although from the time of the job action onward, comedians in Los Angeles were paid for their shows. This included The Comedy Store and The Improv.

It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation. Formal semantics, for instance, helps to write compilers, better understand what a program is doing, and to prove, e.g., that the following \`if\` statement if 1  1 then S1 else S2 has the same effect as \`S1\` alone. Overview The field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following: *The definition of semantic models *The relations between different semantic models *The relations between different approaches to meaning *The relation between computation and the underlying mathematical structures from fields such as logic, set theory, model theory, category theory, etc. It has close links with other areas of computer science such as programming language design, type theory, compilers and interpreters, program verification and model checking. Approaches There are many approaches to formal semantics; these belong to three major classes: * Denotational semantics, whereby each phrase in the language is interpreted as a denotation, i.e. a conceptual meaning that can be thought of abstractly. Such denotations are often mathematical objects inhabiting a mathematical space, but it is not a requirement that they should be so. As a practical necessity, denotations are described using some form of mathematical notation, which can in turn be formalized as a denotational metalanguage. For example, denotational semantics of functional languages often translate the language into domain theory. Denotational semantic descriptions can also serve as compositional translations from a programming language into the denotational metalanguage and used as a basis for designing compilers. * Operational semantics, whereby the execution of the language is described directly (rather than by translation). Operational semantics loosely corresponds to interpretation, although again the \\"implementation language\\" of the interpreter is generally a mathematical formalism. Operational semantics may define an abstract machine (such as the SECD machine), and give meaning to phrases by describing the transitions they induce on states of the machine. Alternatively, as with the pure lambda calculus, operational semantics can be defined via syntactic transformations on phrases of the language itself; * Axiomatic semantics, whereby one gives meaning to phrases by describing the axioms that apply to them. Axiomatic semantics makes no distinction between a phrase's meaning and the logical formulas that describe it; its meaning is exactly what can be proven about it in some logic. The canonical example of axiomatic semantics is Hoare logic. The distinctions between the three broad classes of approaches can sometimes be vague, but all known approaches to formal semantics use the above techniques, or some combination thereof. Apart from the choice between denotational, operational, or axiomatic approaches, most variation in formal semantic systems arises from the choice of supporting mathematical formalism. Variations Some variations of formal semantics include the following: * Action semantics is an approach that tries to modularize denotational semantics, splitting the formalization process in two layers (macro and microsemantics) and predefining three semantic entities (actions, data and yielders) to simplify the specification; * Algebraic semantics is a form of axiomatic semantics based on algebraic laws for describing and reasoning about program semantics in a formal manner; * Attribute grammars define systems that systematically compute \\"metadata\\" (called attributes) for the various cases of the language's syntax. Attribute grammars can be understood as a denotational semantics where the target language is simply the original language enriched with attribute annotations. Aside from formal semantics, attribute grammars have also been used for code generation in compilers, and to augment regular or context-free grammars with context-sensitive conditions; * Categorical (or \\"functorial\\") semantics uses category theory as the core mathematical formalism. A categorical semantics is usually proven to correspond to some axiomatic semantics that gives a syntactic presentation of the categorical structures. Also, denotational semantics are often instances of a general categorical semantics; * Concurrency semantics is a catch-all term for any formal semantics that describes concurrent computations. Historically important concurrent formalisms have included the Actor model and process calculi; * Game semantics uses a metaphor inspired by game theory. * Predicate transformer semantics, developed by Edsger W. Dijkstra, describes the meaning of a program fragment as the function transforming a postcondition to the precondition needed to establish it. Describing relationships For a variety of reasons, one might wish to describe the relationships between different formal semantics. For example: *To prove that a particular operational semantics for a language satisfies the logical formulas of an axiomatic semantics for that language. Such a proof demonstrates that it is \\"sound\\" to reason about a particular (operational) interpretation strategy using a particular (axiomatic) proof system. *To prove that operational semantics over a high-level machine is related by a simulation with the semantics over a low-level machine, whereby the low-level abstract machine contains more primitive operations than the high-level abstract machine definition of a given language. Such a proof demonstrates that the low-level machine \\"faithfully implements\\" the high-level machine. It is also possible to relate multiple semantics through abstractions via the theory of abstract interpretation.  History  Robert W. Floyd is credited with founding the field of programming language semantics in .

The printing plates are located on the large cylinder in the middle. Goss quadruple straightline printing press, 1905 A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. Printing can be done on various substrates, including paper, cardboard, and plastic. Substrates can be sheet feed or unwound on a continuous roll through the press to be printed and further modified if required (e.g. die cut, overprint varnished, embossed). Printing presses that use continuous rolls are sometimes referred to as \\"web presses\\".  Developmental history  William Nicholson filed a 1790 patent for a rotary press. The rotary press itself is an evolution of the cylinder press, also patented by William Nicholson, invented by Beaucher of France in the 1780s and by Friedrich Koenig in the early 19th century.http://www.edwardlloyd.org/printing.htm Rotary drum printing was invented by Richard March Hoe in 1843. An 1844 patent replaced the reciprocating platforms used in earlier designs with a fixed platform served by rotating drums, and through a series of advances a complete rotary printing press was perfected in 1846, and patented in 1847. It appeared in Edinburgh in 1851 and then traveled to London where it was used by the Times newspaper in 1853, where it then traveled to France in 1866 and Germany in 1873. By the time it reached Spain in 1885 it had become common use.Lyons, M. (2013). Books: a living history. London: Thames & Hudson. Some sources describe the Parisian Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni as the inventor of the Rotary printing press, but this was the subject of a patent dispute that was decided in Hoe's favor. A.S. Abell of the Baltimore Sun was the first American user of the rotary press.  Types of rotary printing presses  Today, there are three main types of rotary presses; offset (including web offset), rotogravure, and flexo (short for flexography). Although the three types use cylinders to print, they vary in their method. In Offset lithography, the image is chemically applied to a plate, generally through exposure of photosensitive layers on the plate material. Lithography is based on the fact that water and oil do not mix, which enables the planographic process to work. In the context of a printing plate, a wettable surface (the non-image area) may also be termed hydrophilic and a non-wettable surface (the image area) hydrophobic. Gravure is a process in which small cells or holes are etched into a copper cylinder, which are able to be filled with ink. All the colours are etched in different angles, thus while printing every colour is placed in proper position to give the appropriate image. Flexography is a relief system in which a raised image is created on a typically polymer-based plate. In stamp collecting, rotary-press-printed stamps are sometimes a different size than stamps printed with a flat plate. This happens because the stamp images are farther apart on a rotary press, which makes the individual stamps larger (typically ).

The word may perhaps derive from the term ympe, used to denote a young grafted tree. Imps are often described as mischievous more than seriously threatening, and as lesser beings rather than more important supernatural beings. The attendants of the devil are sometimes described as imps. They are usually described as lively and having small stature. Etymology The Old English noun impa meant a young shoot or scion of a plant or tree, and later came to mean the scion of a noble house, or a child in general. Starting in the 16th century, it was often used in expressions like \\"imps of serpents\\", \\"imp of hell\\", \\"imp of the devil\\", and so on; and by the 17th century, it came to mean a small demon, a familiar of a witch. The Old English noun and associated verb impian appear to come from an unattested Late Latin term *emputa (impotus is attested in the Salic law), the neuter plural of Greek ·ºîŒºœïœÖœÑŒøœÇ 'natural, implanted, grafted'.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edition, 1899, s.v. 'imp' History Old woodcut depicting a woman feeding imps Originating from Germanic folklore the imp was a small lesser demon. Unlike the Christian faith and stories, demons in Germanic legends were not necessarily always evil. Imps were often mischievous rather than evil or harmful and in some regions they were attendants of the gods.Monaghan, Patricia. \\"Imp\\", The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore, Infobase Publishing, 2014, p.250 =The Lincoln Imp= A statue of the Lincoln Imp inside the medieval Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England. It has now become a symbol of the city. A legend in Lincolnshire dating to the 14th-century recounts that the devil, being annoyed with the completion of the cathedral, paid a visit, accompanied by two imps who proceeded to wreak havoc in the building. An angel appeared and ordered them to stop. One turned to throw a rock at the angel and was instantly petrified. > For the tiniest angel, with amethyst eyes, And hair spun like gold, 'fore > the alter [sic] did rise, Pronouncing these words in a dignified tone \\"O > impious imp, be ye turned to stone!\\"O'Neill, Susan. Folklore of > Lincolnshire, The History Press, 2012 While his companion fled, the unfortunate imp remains at the Angel Choir at the east end of the cathedral. The imp is also depicted on the emblem of the local football team Lincoln_City_F.C.. They are also nicknamed The Imps. = Other descriptions= Imps are often shown as small in stature and not very attractive. Their behaviour is described as being wild and uncontrollable, much the same as fairies', and in some cultures they are considered the same beings, both sharing the same sense of free spirit and enjoyment of all things fun. It was later in history that people began to associate fairies as being good and imps as being malicious and evil. However, both creatures were fond of pranks and misleading people. Most of the time these pranks were harmless fun, but some could be upsetting and harmful, such as the switching babies or leading travelers astray in places which they were not familiar. Although imps are often thought of as being immortal, they can be damaged or harmed by certain weapons and enchantments, or be kept out of people's homes by wards. Imps were also portrayed as lonely little creatures in search of human attention, using jokes and pranks to attract human friendship. This often backfired when people became annoyed with the imp's endeavours, usually driving it away. Even if the imp was successful in getting the friendship it sought, it still often played pranks on its friend either out of boredom or simply because this was the nature of the imp. This trait led to using the word ‚Äúimpish‚Äù for someone who loves pranks and practical jokes. Eventually, it came to be believed that imps were the familiar spirit servants of witches and warlocks, where the little demons served as spies and informants. During the time of the witch hunts, supernatural creatures such as imps were sought out as proof of witchcraft, though often the so-called imp was merely a black cat, lizard, toad or some other form of uncommon pet.  Objects  Imps have also been described as being ‚Äúbound‚Äù or contained in some sort of object such as a sword or crystal ball. In other cases imps were simply kept in a certain object and summoned only when their masters had need of them. Some even had the ability to grant their owner's wishes much like a genie. This was the object of the 1891 story The Bottle Imp by Robert Louis Stevenson, which told of an imp contained in a bottle that would grant the owner their every wish, but their soul would be sent to Hell if they didn't sell the bottle to a new owner before their death.  Culture  Imps can be found in art and architecture throughout the world, most of the time carefully and painstakingly hidden and only being found by the most interested and observant of people.

It is about east-north-east of Brackley, Northamptonshire and north-west of Buckingham. The River Great Ouse forms part of the western boundary of the parish, separating the village from Northamptonshire. The ancient royal forest of Whittlewood extended to the northern edge of the village. History The village toponym is derived from the Old English for either \\"house in a valley\\" or \\"Byttel's valley\\". In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village is recorded as Betesdene. In 1147 Ernald de Bosco founded the Cistercian Biddlesden Abbey. In 1315, the village was granted a temporary charter to hold a weekly market. When the abbey was seized on behalf of Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was assessed to be earning in excess of ¬£175 annually in rents and tithes. Although the abbey continued after this time as living accommodation for those in favour with the monarch, the building was not maintained thoroughly and fell into disrepair. By the 18th century the abbey was in ruins and was finally demolished in 1727. The country house of Biddlesden Park was built on the same site. Within the parish of Biddlesden there was the hamlet of Evershaw. In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle at the time of King Edward the Confessor this settlement was listed as being in the possession of a \\"certain bandy-legged man\\". Evershaw's toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"boar wood\\". The family names \\"Evershaw\\" and \\"Eversaw\\" are derived from this place. No trace of the hamlet remains today.

History  The village name is a common one in England, and means Bishop's Estate. It is not known to which Bishop this refers though as the village lies within the ancient diocese of Lincoln, it presumedly denotes property owned by the Bishop of Lincoln. The village was first recorded in manorial rolls of 1227 as Bissopeston.  Location  Bishopstone resides amongst farm land just a mile east of Stone and two miles south of Aylesbury. The village is overlooked by the Chiltern Hills, most notably Coombe Hill with its Boer War memorial, a well known Buckinghamshire landmark and viewpoint. Bishopstone is easily accessible from the A418 which runs from Aylesbury to Thame in Oxfordshire.  Amenities  Due to Bishopstone's relatively remote location there is a limited bus service that makes a single return journey to Aylesbury, allowing a few hours in town, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The closest train stations are located in Aylesbury and at Little Kimble 2.5 miles south. The only pub in the village, The Harrow, was closed for 5 years but re-opened in October 2019 after a total refurbishment of both the grounds and building. There is no village shop; however neighbouring Stone is host to an Indian restaurant, a petrol filling station, antiques store, a grocery store and post office.

Also The Question of Monopolies by Nathaniel Branden defines and discusses coercive monopoly. A coercive monopoly is not merely a sole supplier of a particular kind of good or service (a monopoly), but it is a monopoly where there is no opportunity to compete with it through means such as price competition, technological or product innovation, or marketing; entry into the field is closed. As a coercive monopoly is securely shielded from the possibility of competition, it is able to make pricing and production decisions with the assurance that no competition will arise. It is a case of a non-contestable market. A coercive monopoly has very few incentives to keep prices low and may deliberately price gouge consumers by curtailing production.Kudlow, Lawrence, The Judicial Hacker, in Jewish World Review (June 14, 2000) Also, according to economist Murray Rothbard, \\"a coercive monopolist will tend to perform his service badly and inefficiently.\\"Rothbard, Murray, The State Versus Liberty in The Ethics of Liberty by Rothbard (1982) Whether coercive monopolies can arise in free market, or whether they require government intervention to institute them is a point of some disagreement. Advocates of free markets argue that the only feasible way that a business could close entry to a field and therefore be able to raise prices free of competitive forces, i.e. be a coercive monopoly, is with the aid of government in restricting competition. It is argued that without government preventing competition, the firm must keep prices low because if they sustain unreasonably high prices, they will attract others to enter the field to compete. In other words, if the monopoly is not protected from competition by government intervention, it still faces potential competition, so that there is an incentive to keep prices low and a disincentive to price gouge (i.e., competitive pressures still exist in a non- coercive monopoly situation). Others, such as some business ethicists, believe that a free market can produce coercive monopolies.Hasnas, John. The normative theories of business ethics: a guide for the perplexed . in Business Ethics Quarterly v. 8 (Jan. 1998) p. 19-42 ISSN 1052-150X Number: BSSI98006753 Contrasted with other monopolies Exclusive control of electricity supply due to government imposed \\"utility\\" status is a coercive monopoly, because users have no choice but to pay the price that the monopolist demands. Consumers do not have an alternative to purchase electricity from a cheaper competitor, because the wires running into their homes belong to the monopolist. Exclusive control of Coca-Cola is not a coercive monopoly because consumers have a choice to drink another cola brand and the Coca-Cola company is subject to competitive forces. Consequently, there is an upper limit to which the company can raise its prices before profits begin to erode because of the presence of viable substitute goods. By contrast, to maintain a non- coercive monopoly, a monopolist must make pricing and production decisions knowing that if prices are too high or quality is too low competition may arise from another firm that can better serve the market. If it is successful, it is called an efficiency monopoly, because it has been able to keep production and supply costs lower than any other possible competitor so that it can charge a lower price than others and still be profitable. Since potential competitors are not able to be so efficient, they are not able to charge a lower, or comparable, price and still be profitable. Hence, competing in a non-coercive monopoly is possible but would not be profitable, whereas for a coercive monopoly competition would be profitable but is not possible. Establishing a coercive monopoly According to business ethicist, John Hasnas, \\"most [contemporary business ethicists] take for granted that a free market produces coercive monopolies.\\" However, some people, including Alan Greenspan and Nathaniel Branden, argue that such independence from competitive forces \\"can be accomplished only by an act of government intervention, in the form of special regulations, subsidies, or franchises.\\"Antitrust, by Alan Greenspan Branden, Nathaniel, 'The Question of Monopolies , from The Objectivist Newsletter (June 1962) Some point out that a monopolist themselves may \\"employ violence\\" to create or maintain a coercive monopoly. Some recommend that government create coercive monopolies. For example, claims of natural monopoly are often used as justification for government intervening to establish a statutory monopoly (government monopoly or government-granted monopoly) where competition is outlawed, under the claim that multiple firms providing a good or service entails more collective costs to an economy than that which would be the case if a single firm provided a good or service. This has often been done with electricity, water, telecommunications, and mail delivery. Some economists believe that such coercive monopolies are beneficial because of greater economies of scale and because they are more likely to act in the national interest, while Judge Richard Posner famously argued in Natural Monopoly and Its Regulation that the deadweight losses associated with regulating such monopolies were greater than any possible benefit.Posner, Richard A. Natural Monopoly and Its Regulation (). Private coercion A corporation which successfully engages in coercion to the extent that it eliminates the possibility of competition, operates a coercive monopoly. A firm may use illegal or non-economic methods, such as extortion, to achieve and retain a coercive monopoly position. A company which has become the sole supplier of a commodity through non-coercive means (such as by simply outcompeting all other firms), may theoretically then go on to become a coercive monopoly if it maintains its position by engaging in coercive \\"barriers to entry.\\" The most famous historical examples of this type of coercive monopoly began in 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution went into effect. This period, called Prohibition, presented lucrative opportunities for organized crime to take over the importation (\\"bootlegging\\"), manufacture, and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Al Capone, one of the most famous bootleggers of them all, built his criminal empire largely on profits from illegal alcohol, and effectively used coercion (including murder) to impose barriers to entry to his competitors. However, it may be relevant to take into account the fact that government was intervening in the alcohol industry by making manufacture and sales illegal and arresting those in the business, thereby enabling unnaturally high profits, and was not providing the usual service of enforcing trade contracts; likewise, some corrupt public officials derived rent-like profit from bribes that ensured that Capone would receive preferential treatment against potential competitors. Antitrust There are examples in history where a firm that is not a government-granted monopoly is claimed to have a coercive monopoly, and antitrust action has been initiated to resolve the perceived problem. For example, in United States v. Microsoft The Plaintiff's Finding of Fact alleged that Microsoft \\"coerced\\" Apple Computer to enter into contracts resulting in the prohibition of competition. Eric Raymond, an author and one of the founders of the Open Source Initiative, says \\"The thing a lot of people somehow missed is that the courts affirmed the findings of fact ‚Äì that Microsoft is indeed a coercive monopoly.\\"Silicon Valley, AOL TW React With Caution in The Industry Standard, (June 28, 2001) Another disputed example, is the case of U.S. v. Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) in 1945. The court concluded that Alcoa \\"excluded competitors.\\" The ruling is heavily criticized for punishing efficiency and is quoted below. > It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the > demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to > keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. > It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more > effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it > opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a > great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections > and the elite of personnel. Advocates of a laissez-faire economic policy are quick to assert (barring private criminal conduct) that a coercive monopoly can only come about through government intervention, and defend these situations as non-coercive monopolies in which government should not intervene. They argue that competition with these monopolies is open to any firm that can offer lower prices or better products ‚Äîthat competition is not excluded. They claim that these monopolies keep their prices low precisely because they are not exempt from competitive forces. In other words, the possibility of competition arising indeed affects their pricing and production decisions. A coercive monopoly would be able to price-gouge consumers secure in the knowledge that no competition could develop. Some see low prices as evidence for a non- coercive monopoly. Government monopolies Undisputed examples of coercive monopolies are those that are enforced by law. In a government monopoly, an agency under the direct authority of the government itself holds the monopoly, and the coercive monopoly status is sustained by the enforcement of laws or regulations that ban competition, or reserve exclusive control over factors of production for the government. The state-owned petroleum companies that are common in oil-rich developing countries (such as Aramco in Saudi Arabia or PDVSA in Venezuela) are examples of government monopolies created through nationalization of resources and existing firms; the United States Postal Service is an example of a coercive monopoly created through laws that ban potential competitors such as UPS or FedEx from offering competing services (in this case, first-class and standard (formerly called \\"third-class\\") mail delivery).1 Government-granted monopolies often closely resemble government monopolies in many respects, but the two are distinguished by the decision- making structure of the monopolist. In government monopoly, the holder of the monopoly is formally the government itself and the group of people who make business decisions is an agency under the government's direct authority. In government-granted monopoly, on the other hand, the coercive monopoly is enforced through law, but the holder of the monopoly is formally a private firm, or a subsidiary division of a private firm, which makes its own business decisions. Examples of government-granted monopolies include cable television and water providers in many municipalities in the United States, exclusive petroleum exploration grants to companies such as Standard Oil in many countries, and historically, lucrative colonial \\"joint stock\\" companies such as the Dutch East India Company, which were granted exclusive trading privileges with colonial possessions under mercantilist economic policy. Intellectual property such as copyrights and patents are government-granted monopolies. Another example is the thirty-year government-granted monopoly that was granted to Robert Fulton by the State of New York in steamboat traffic, but was later ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court to be unconstitutional because of a conflicting inter-state grant to Thomas Gibbons by the federal Congress. 2 Economist Lawrence W. Reed says that a government can cause a coercive monopoly without explicitly banning competition but by \\"simply [bestowing] privileges, immunities, or subsidies on one firm while imposing costly requirements on all others.\\"Reed, Lawrence. Witch-Hunting for Robber Barons: The Standard Oil Story The Freeman, a publication of The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc., March 1980, Vol. 30, No. 3. For example, Alan Greenspan, in his essay Antitrust argues that land subsidies to railroad companies in the western portion of the U.S. in 19th century created a coercive monopoly position. He says that \\"with the aid of the federal government, a segment of the railroad industry was able to \\"break free' from the competitive bounds which had prevailed in the East.\\" In addition, some claim that regulations can be established that place burdens on smaller firms that attempt to compete with an industry leader. The state as coercive monopoly Economist Murray Rothbard, noted for his espousal of anarcho- capitalism, argues that the state itself is a coercive monopoly as it uses force to establish \\"a compulsory monopoly over police and military services, the provision of law, judicial decision-making, the mint and the power to create money, unused land ('the public domain'), streets and highways, rivers and coastal waters, and the means of delivering mail.\\" He says that \\"a coercive monopolist tends to perform his service badly and inefficiently\\". In addition to moral arguments over the use of force, free market anarchists often argue that if these services were open to competition that the market could supply them at a lower price and higher quality. Unions Labor unions have been called coercive monopolies which keep wages rates higher than they would otherwise be if individuals competed with each other for wages. Economists who believe this to be the case refer to this as a monopoly wage. (Heery, Edmund; Noon, Mike (2002). A Dictionary of Human Resources Management. Oxford University Press. p. 225) Footnotes 1\\\\. Lysander Spooner started the commercially successful American Letter Mail Company in order to compete with the United States Post Office by providing lower rates. He was successfully challenged by the U.S. government and exhausted his resources trying to defend what he believed to be his right to compete. 2\\\\. For about six months, Thomas Gibbons and Cornelius Vanderbilt operated a steamboat with lower fares in defiance of the law. Gibbons successfully took his case to the United States Supreme Court. The Court ruled in Gibbons v. Ogden that the state-government-granted monopoly, which conducted some service between New York and New Jersey, was an unconstitutional violation of interstate commerce.

It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, and is found in more than 80 nations and geographic areas. Since 1987, the organization also accepts women as members. Membership in Kiwanis and its family of clubs is more than 600,000 members. Each year, Kiwanis clubs raise more than US$100 million and report more than 18.5 million volunteer hours to strengthen communities and serve children. Kiwanis International is a volunteer-led organization headed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 19 members: 15 trustees, four elected officers, and an executive director. The trustees serve three-year terms, with five trustees elected each year. As set out in the bylaws, nine trustees are elected from the United States and Pacific Canada Region, one trustee is elected from the Canada and Caribbean Region, two trustees are elected from the European Region, two trustees are elected from the Asia-Pacific Region, and one trustee is elected \\"at large\\" from any region other than the United States and Pacific Canada. The elected officers included (in order of progression): vice president, president-elect, president and immediate past president. These officers, along with the United States and Pacific Canada Region trustees, are elected at the annual convention of Kiwanis International. All trustees and officers are unpaid volunteers. The executive director is a full-time employee who is responsible for the organization's paid staff and serves as a non-voting member of the Board. There are seven regions in Kiwanis: Africa; Asia-Pacific; Canada and Caribbean; Europe; Latin America; Middle East; and United States and Pacific Canada. The United States and Pacific Canada Region incorporates the 50 states of the United States as well as British Columbia and the Yukon Territory of Canada. There are fifty-three administrative areas called districts. District boards typically consist of a governor-elect, governor, and immediate-past governor, secretary, treasurer, and several trustees or lieutenant governors. Districts are further divided into service areas called divisions, comprising 5 to 20 clubs and headed by a lieutenant governor. Clubs have boards consisting of a vice president (and/or president elect), president, immediate past president, secretary, treasurer, and typically about five directors. At both the district and club level, secretary/treasurer may be combined by one person and may be a volunteer or a paid employee; all other positions are unpaid.The information in this section is laid out in  Etymology  The name ‚ÄúKiwanis‚Äù was coined from the Ojibwe language expression derived from the word giiwanizi meaning to \\"fool around\\":Rhodes, Richard. 1993. \\"giiwnizid\\" in Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary. ningiiwaniz, which is found in the Baraga Dictionary as \\"nin Kiwanis\\", meaning \\"I make noise; I am foolish and wanton\\" or \\"I play with noise\\".Baraga, Frederic 1878 (reprint 1992). \\"Kiwanis\\" in A Dictionary of the Otchipwe Language (reprint as A Dictionary of the Ojibway Language). Although Random House Dictionary states that it comes from one of the Algonquian languages and means \\"to make oneself known\\",\\"Kiwanis\\" in The Random House Dictionary of the English Language. in Ojibwe and other related Algonquian languages, this expression would be gikendami'idizo. Whatever the original meaning, the organization's founders translated it as \\"We build\\", which became the original motto of Kiwanis. In 2005 the organization chose a new motto, \\"Serving the Children of the World\\". Members of the club are called Kiwanians.  Ideals  =Defining statement= \\"Kiwanis is a global organization of volunteers dedicated to improving the world, one child and one community at a time.\\", the word \\"changing\\" was changed to \\"improving\\" in January 2014 =Motto= Kiwanis' motto is \\"Serving the Children of the World.\\" The original motto was \\"We Trade\\". A new motto of \\"We Build\\" was adopted during the 1920 International Convention and represented Kiwanis for more than 80 years. =Objects= The six permanent Objects of Kiwanis International were approved by Kiwanis club delegates at the 1924 Convention in Denver, Colorado. * To give primacy to the human and spiritual rather than to the material values of life. * To encourage the daily living of the Golden Rule in all human relationships. * To promote the adoption and the application of higher social, business, and professional standards. * To develop, by precept and example, a more intelligent, aggressive, and serviceable citizenship. * To provide, through Kiwanis clubs, a practical means to form enduring friendships, to render altruistic service, and to build better communities. * To cooperate in creating and maintaining that sound public opinion and high idealism which make possible the increase of righteousness, justice, patriotism, and goodwill. History The organization originated in August 1914 in Detroit, Michigan from a conversation between Allen S. Browne and Joseph G. Prance. Browne's idea was to solicit business and professional men asking them if they would be interested in organizing a fraternal organization with a health benefit feature. Browne was compensated five dollars per new member that joined for his operating budget. Browne and Prance set out and recruited enough members to apply to the state for a not for profit status. The state approved the application on January 21, 1915 and the Supreme Lodge Benevolent Order Brothers was formed. The name was changed to Kiwanis a year later. The Kiwanis Club of Detroit is the original local club in Kiwanis. By 1927 the organization had more than 100,000 members. Kiwanis became international with the organization of the Kiwanis club of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, in 1916. Kiwanis limited its membership to the United States and Canada until 1962, when worldwide expansion was approved. Since then, Kiwanis has spread to all inhabited continents of the globe. The original purpose of Kiwanis was to exchange business between members and to serve the poor. The debate as to whether to focus on networking or service was resolved in 1919, when Kiwanis adopted a service-focused mission. In 1924, the Objects of Kiwanis were adopted (see above) and remain unchanged today. Each year, clubs sponsor nearly 150,000 service projects, complete more than 18.5 million hours in volunteer service and raise more than $100 million. As a global project in coordination with UNICEF, members and clubs contributed more than $80 million toward the global elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Beginning in 2010 Kiwanis International joined with UNICEF to launch a new worldwide health initiative, The Eliminate Project, dedicated to wiping out maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT), which kills more than 100,000 babies worldwide each year. US Representative Martha Roby (center) with Kiwanis members in Ozark, Alabama Until 1987 the organization accepted only men as members. By action of the International Convention in 1987, the rules were changed to admit women as well. Women constitute about 26% of total members. At the 2013 International Convention, Sue Petrisin was elected as the organization's first female international vice president. Petrisin was installed as Kiwanis International President in 2015, the year of the organization's 100th anniversary. She is the first female to lead any major member service organization. Service Kiwanis clubs decide for themselves what projects to do in their community, based on their own community's needs and their members' interests. Service to children is a primary focus in Kiwanis. Clubs are encouraged to conduct a community survey each year to determine what unmet needs exist in their community. In some cases, clubs in a geographic region (a \\"Division\\" or \\"District\\") may take on a project of shared interest, such as paediatric trauma, or children's cancer. Service may be provided directly (e.g. reading to children at the library or taking therapy dogs into seniors' facilities) or through raising funds in the community to meet a community need (such as building a playground). Common fund-raising events include breakfast such as pancake feeds, peanut sales, or food concessions. Areas of service may include assistance to those living in poverty, projects that benefit children and youth, and services for the sick or elderly. As a global project in coordination with UNICEF, members and clubs contributed more than $80 million toward the global elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability. Beginning in 2010 Kiwanis International once again joined with UNICEF to launch a new worldwide health initiative, dedicated to wiping out maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT), which kills more than 50,000 babies and a significant number of women each year.Elimination of Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus UNICEF Retrieved March 27, 2017 The clubs are known for the \\"Kiwanis doll\\".

Kiwanis family Kiwanis provides leadership and service opportunities for youth through its Service Leadership Programs. Aktion Club, Key Club, Circle K, Builders Club and K-Kids are part of Kiwanis Service Leadership Programs. They are sponsored by a local Kiwanis club and receive funding and leadership guidance from Kiwanis. =Key Club= Kiwanis founded and supports Key Club International. Started in Sacramento, California in 1925, Key Club is the oldest and largest service program for high school students in the world. As of 2010, Key Club has 250,000 members in 5,000 clubs in 30 nations, primarily in the United States and Canada, but with clubs also in Central and South America, Caribbean nations, Asia, and Australia. KIWIN'S (pronounced \\"kee-wins\\"), a high school program exclusive to the California-Nevada-Hawaii district, operates under the umbrella of Key Club but elects its own officers. =Circle K= The collegiate version of Kiwanis, which maintains some autonomy from Kiwanis, is Circle K International, also known as CKI. The first official Circle K club was chartered in September, 1947 at the campus of Carthage College (then in Illinois). As of 2010, Circle K membership is 12,600 members in 500 clubs in 17 countries, making Circle K the largest collegiate service organization of its kind in the world. =K-Kids, Builders Club, Aktion Club, Kiwanis Junior= K-Kids is intended for grades 4-5 in elementary school, and has a membership of 33,000 in 1,100 clubs in 8 nations. Builders Club (middle school) has 42,000 members in 1,400 clubs in 12 nations. Aktion Club (for people who have disabilities) has 8,400 members in 400 clubs in 7 nations. These programs are all led by adult advisors (Kiwanians or faculty members), whereas Key Club and Circle K elect their own club, district, and International officers each year to lead the organization. Kiwanis Junior is part of the European Service Leadership Program, with clubs in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy, and is typically for people ages 18‚Äì35. =Kiwaniannes= Before 1987, women's auxiliary clubs known as Kiwaniannes also existed, made up of wives of members of the men-only Kiwanis clubs. With the changes that made it possible for women to join Kiwanis clubs, official sponsorship of the Kiwaniannes clubs ended. Some Kiwaniannes clubs merged with their affiliated Kiwanis club, while others converted into independent Kiwanis clubs.

It is about north-west of Long Crendon and south- east of Bicester. At the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish was 1,141. Brill has a royal charter to hold a weekly market, but has not done so for many years. Toponymy Brill's name is tautological, being a combination of Brythonic and Anglo Saxon words for 'hill' (Brythonic breg and Anglo Saxon hyll). The name attracted the attention of J. R. R. Tolkien, who based the Middle-earth village of Bree upon it.\\"Bree ... [was] based on Brill ... a place which he knew well\\": Christopher Tolkien (1988), The Return of the Shadow (being vol.VI of The History of Middle-earth), ch. 7, p. 131, note 6, Manor Brill The manor of Brill was the administration centre for the royal hunting Forest of Bernwood and was for a long time a property of the Crown. King Edward the Confessor had a palace here.See Osbert of Clare's life of St. Edward, chapter 16 (Analecta Bollandiana 41 (1923), 96). There is evidence that Henry II, John, Henry III and Stephen all held court at the palace. It remained in place until the time of Charles I, who turned the building into a Royalist garrison in the English Civil War. This led the Parliamentarian John Hampden to destroy it in 1643. Church and priory The Church of England parish church of All Saints was built early in the 12th century, and its nave and chancel remain essentially Norman structures.Page, 1927, pages 14‚Äì19 The chancel's north wall has a blocked lancet window from that period.Pevsner, 1973, page 72 The pointed chancel arch is 13th century. The Perpendicular Gothic west tower was built early in the 15th century. The present chancel roof dates from the 17th century. The north aisle was built in 1839 but its east window dates from about 1275. In 1888 All Saints' was largely rebuilt under the direction of John Oldrid Scott. Scott extended the chancel eastwards by about and added a new Gothic Revival east window. He added the south aisle and porch at the same time but its east and west windows are re-used Perpendicular Gothic ones, probably dating from early in the 16th century. All Saints was a chapel of ease to the nearby parish of Oakley from the 12th until the 16th century. It belonged to the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Brill had a hermitage or priory dedicated to St. Werburgh that was annexed to Chetwode Priory from 1251. Chetwode Priory surrendered the advowson of the hermitage to the Bishop of Lincoln in 1460. Brill windmill 180px Brill is also known for its windmill, last owned and used by the Pointer and Nixie family who also baked bread in their house in the village. With timbers dating from 1685, Brill Windmill provides one of the earliest and best preserved examples of a post mill (the earliest type of European windmill) in the UK. Management and ownership of the Grade II* listed mill was passed to Buckinghamshire County Council in 1947 who, through a number of major interventions, have ensured that the mill still stands today. In 1967 the Council installed a structural steel framework that helps to support the mill's ancient timber frame but means that the mill is static and can no longer turn to face the wind. =Restoration project= By the 2000s water ingress and weathering had caused timber decay to the extent that the structure's integrity was described as \\"At risk\\". The Brill Windmill Management Group was established in 2007 to help plan a restoration project and to seek the necessary funds. With funding from English Heritage and WREN, full repair and preservation work was completed by July 2009. The mill is now structurally sound and once again open to the public, once a week, between March and September. Brill tramway Former site of the Brill Tramway terminus Brill railway station was once a north-western terminus of the London Underground system.Oppitz, 2000, page not cited After the completion in 1868 of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, the Duke of Buckingham built the light railway to provide freight access by rail to his estates at Wotton Underwood. The extension to Brill gave access to a brickworks there. The line was opened in 1871, and following public demand passenger facilities were provided early in 1872. Originally known as the Brill Tramway, the line's name changed to \\"Oxford and Aylesbury Tramroad\\" when a company was formed in an abortive attempt to extend the line to Oxford; the biggest hindering expense was the cost of tunnelling under Brill Hill. The original Quainton Road station was north of the Quainton‚ÄìWaddesdon road, and wagons from the Brill line reached it by means of a wagon turntable; there was no direct access.Mitchell and Smith, 2006, page not cited When the Metropolitan Railway took over the line in 1896, it doubled the main line from Aylesbury and re- sited the station to its present position, replacing a level crossing with the present road over bridge; a running connection between the Brill line and the main line was constructed at that time. In 1935, on the creation of the LPTB, control was transferred to it from the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Committee which had taken it over in 1906; the whole branch was closed on 30 November 1935. Little London The hamlet of Little London to the south was part of Brill parish until 1934, when Buckinghamshire County Council moved the parish boundary and transferred the hamlet to Oakley. When the Metropolitan railway built Brill station, it has been said that in honour of the metropolitan ambience the planners were trying to evoke, another Little London was founded to the north of the village.

The Book of Moroni () is the last of the books that make up the Book of Mormon. According to the text it was written by the prophet Moroni sometime between 400 and 421. Moroni consists of ten chapters.https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/title- page?lang=eng  Narrative  Moroni's people had been destroyed by the Lamanites down to every last man, woman, and child, even taking his father. And they were hunting Moroni so they could make the genocide complete. But when he was not fleeing for his life, he took the time to write a few things that might be edifying to those same Lamanites. The first thing he wrote down was the procedure that Jesus used to make apostles, priests, and teachers. Then he described the procedure for administering the ordinances of the Last Supper and baptism. If a member of the church committed sin, and three witnesses condemned them before the church elders and they still did not repent, then their names were blotted out of the church rolls. Moroni chapter eight is an epistle from Mormon to his son Moroni written soon after his son was elevated to the ministry, and it focuses almost solely on the doctrine of baptism. Specifically, it calls infant baptism extreme error. Mormon says that Jesus came to call sinners to repentance, but children are not capable of committing sin. Mormon denies the dogma of Original Sin, in other words. \\"Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity, for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.\\" In Moroni chapter 9, his father Mormon reports that he is still alive, but the Lamanites were victorious in battle, and a number of leading Nephites have been slain. Mormon fears that the Lamanites will utterly destroy his people. Nevertheless, he is still preaching the Word of God to them, but when he uses harsh words they get angry, and when he uses soft words they harden their hearts against it. The Lamanites took many prisoners in the battle. They slew all the men. They fed to the women the flesh of their husbands and they fed the children the flesh of their fathers, and gave them almost no water. Still, these atrocities pale in comparison to those of the Nephites in Mariantum, who availed themselves of the daughters of the Lamanites, tortured them to death, and ate their flesh. Mormon asks his son, rhetorically, how God could be expected to withhold judgment from such a people. He especially grieves for the widows and their daughters in Sherrizah, who are starving because both armies have carried away most of the food. And Mormon can do nothing for them, because the army of the Lamanites is between him and that city. In 421 CE Moroni wrote a few more things before adding his plates to the ones his father sealed up in the hill Cumorah. He asks anyone who reads these records in the latter days to ponder them in his heart and ask God in prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, if the things are true. And if they ask with a sincere heart, the truth of them will be made manifest through the power of the Holy Spirit. Analysis Chapter 1 is a short introduction. Chapters 2-6 contain some direction as to how the church was organized. The ordinances of baptism, the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and the sacrament are detailed. Also, some general instruction on the laws in the church are given. Chapter 7 is a sermon that Mormon gave to the Nephites. This sermon focuses on the essence of good and evil. :15 For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night. :16 For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God. :17 But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him. Mormon finishes by talking about miracles, faith, hope, and charity. :37 Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain. :38 For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made. :45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. :46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail‚Äî :47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him. Chapters 8 and 9 contain two letters to Moroni from his father, Mormon. The first talks about the beginnings of apostasy among the Nephites, focusing particularly on the practice of infant baptism. The second details the awful state of the Nephites and foreshadows their destruction. Chapter 10 contains Moroni's Promise and some advice for people in the present day. He writes about spiritual gifts, faith, hope and charity. Moroni declares that his words are the words of one \\"speaking out of the dust\\" which alludes to a prophecy of Isaiah (see Isaiah 29:4). Moroni 10 contains some of the most well-known and most often quoted verses in the Book of Mormon. Notes Further reading * James E.

It is located in the Central Mid-Levels district and typically has 1,000 students. Apart from Chinese related subjects and French language studies, the main language taught is English. The sponsoring body of the College is the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, incorporated in Hong Kong under the St Joseph's College Incorporation Ordinance, Cap. 1048 of the Laws of Hong Kong. The stated mission of the College is \\"to educate students in areas of intellectual, physical, social, moral and emotional development\\" and \\"to impart a human and Christian education...and to do so with faith and zeal\\".St. Joseph's College (2006). St. Joseph's College School Profile 2006-2007 The north and west blocks of the College are declared monuments of Hong Kong.List of declared monuments of Hong Kong as at 12 Jan 2007 The extension of the campus at 26 Kennedy Road is also a Grade I historic building. The school has been breeding all-rounded young men for the betterment of Hong Kong and the World, from Head of State, Nobel Laureate to Olympians. It has earned its prestige and has been joined by both members of notable families and determined boys of all backgrounds. History =Founding of the College (1875-1880)= The College was previously a Portuguese commercial school named St Saviour's College, located on Pottinger Street in 1860. Father Timoleon Raimondi, who was then the bishop of the Colony, convinced Rome to send the Lasallian Brothers to the British Colony. On 7 November 1875, six Lasallian Brothers arrived in Hong Kong: Brothers Hidulphe Marie (Director), Hidulphe de Jesus, and Hebertus from the Boarding school of Marseilles, Brother Adrian Edmund and Aldolphus Marie from the Novitiate of London and Brother Isfrid from Paris. They renamed the school after Saint Joseph, the patron saint of workers and of the Universal Church.The Birth of Lasallian Schools in Hong Kong , lasalle.org.hk; accessed 4 February 2018. At the time of the takeover, the school had just 75 students. Later that year, however, hundreds of Portuguese families had taken refuge in Hong Kong after a disastrous typhoon had swept over Macau causing the school's enrollment to double after just a few weeks. As a result, Brother Hidulphe had to suspend the intake of Chinese students. To accommodate the increased number of students, a house (Buxley Lodge) situated at 9 Caine Road was purchased in 1876. =Robinson Road (1881-1917)= St Joseph's College at Robinson Road c. 1910 In April 1880, Brother Cyprian was appointed Director. He had been a teacher in New York and Quebec, had held the directorship of several schools in his native land, Canada, and had taught in London and in Paris. In order to cater for the needs of the fast-growing school, a piece of land in Glenealy below Robinson Road was bought, and a two-story Victorian building became home to the College in 1881. In January 1884, Brother Ivarch Louis took over the directorship and was succeeded in 1889 by Brother Abban. Enrollment had then increased to 409, and two Chinese staff were employed by the college; in the same year, a third floor was added to the school building to accommodate boarders. The additional wings were added in 1901. =The Kennedy Road campus (1918- )= Front entrance The North Block and West Block On 13 February 1918, the Robinson Road campus was severely damaged by an earthquake. The Club Germania at 7 Kennedy Road was subsequently purchased on 3 September. Because pupils living on the Kowloon side had to cross by ferry round-trip every day, a branch school was set up on Chatham Road, Kowloon, which became the La Salle College in 1932. During the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945, the College was used as a clinical depot by the Imperial Japanese Army. Some Brothers fled to Vietnam and became guests of the Dominicans and the Jesuits, while others were kept as prisoners of war in the local concentration camps. The campus was kept in shape by a minor staffer called Ah Yiu, who would also smuggle essentials into the camps for the Brothers.St. Joseph's College Editorial Board (2003). \\"The Unique School: a detailed account on the campus of our college\\". Green & White 2003 134-147. The College soon resumed classes after the war. In 1962, Club Germania was demolished and a modern eight-storey building (New Building) was erected under Principal Brother Brenden Dunne.Felix Chun (1998). \\"My days in St. Joseph's College\\". Green & White 1998 1:132-143. Campus The College is located near the central business district of Hong Kong. The college architecture is a combination of typical colonial European (British Imperialist) and modern styles. The Charles Kao Block (Old Building, north block), constructed in 1920, houses most of the classrooms. The Chapel Block (west block) houses the Old Hall, music room, laboratories, lecture room and school chapel. These buildings were built in a Colonial style reflecting European influences. The two blocks are declared monuments of Hong Kong since August 2000. The modern New Building (south block), which replaced the original Club Germania on the site, houses the higher grades' classrooms. The New Hall, senior laboratories, a library and computer rooms are also located here. In 2016, the College successfully acquired the former St. Paul's Co-educational (Kennedy Road) Primary School at 26 Kennedy Road, a Grade 1 Historical Building, from the Education Bureau. Staff The College is governed by the School Management Committee. Members of the committee include the supervisor, the principal, two vice-principals, a teachers' representative, a Parent-Teacher Association representative, an Old Boys' Association representative and three Lasallian Brothers. The faculty includes 67 classroom teachers, a careers mistress, a discipline mistress, a counselling mistress, a sports master, a librarian, one Native English Speaking (NET) teacher, and a French teacher. Laboratory technicians, IT technicians and a library assistant are also employed. A part-time social worker is accessible to the students. The current school supervisor is Brother Chan Jeffrey.List of current teachers, sjc.edu.hk; accessed 4 February 2018. Extra-curricular activities =Sports= In 1877, just two years after its establishment, the College held the first local inter-school sports competition with St. Paul's College, and in 1880 it established one of the first modern football teams in China. The first local inter-school athletic meet with Queen's College and Diocesan Boys' School was held in 1899, and in 1903 the first local inter-school football league was formed with the two schools. =Scouting, Red Cross and St. John Ambulance= Winners plaque of the Prince of Wales Banner Competition The College established a Scout troop in 1913, which was the first within the Catholic Church community in Hong Kong. As other Boy Scouts in Hong Kong were connected with the Protestant Boys' Brigade and British Boy Scouts, the St Joseph's College troop registered with The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom as its first Hong Kong Boy Scout Troop, two years before The Boy Scouts Association established a branch in Hong Kong.Scout Association of Hong Kong History of Hong Kong scouting, scout.org.hk; accessed 4 February 2018. On 1 November 1967, an ambulance cadet division of the St. John Ambulance Brigade was established at the College and was the first ambulance cadet division after the first re- organization in the 1950s. =Music= Since 1974, the College has taken part in the champion title in Male Voice Quartet, Folk music, Solos and Duets, the Dorothy Smith Trophy (Boys Junior: Treble Choir), the Music Society Shield (Mixed Voice Choir), the Dr. Karl Hohner Shield (Melodica Band) and the Moutrie Challenge Trophy (Piano Solos: Final) in the Hong Kong Schools Music Festival. The school has set up different music groups so as to enhance students' interest in music through various performances and joint-school events. The School Orchestra was established in 2000 and has performed in different public events and concerts. In March 2013, the School Orchestra performed with Tonbridge School Orchestra from the UK during its overseas Tour to Hong Kong. Established in 2007, the Chinese Orchestra goal is to give Josephians an opportunity to perform Chinese music through different performances. The school has also established other music groups such as the Josephians' Chamber Orchestra, Junior Choir, Senior Choir, Melodica Band and Chinese Drum Band. Each year, the school organizes a concert called the \\"Green and White Concert\\" in early July. The 10th G&W; Concert was organized at City Hall, Hong Kong in 2012 with various special features. =Information Technology= St Joseph's College developed an Apache web server as early as the 1990s and launched Green & White Online, one of the first secondary school websites in Hong Kong. Motto, badge, and rally The school motto Labore et Virtute (Latin); \\"Âã§ÂãûËàáÁæéÂæ∑\\" (Chinese); Labour and Virtue (English) ‚Äî is meant to summarize the life of Saint Joseph. The badge of the College displays a shield divided into three divisions. The top division shows the Signum Fidei (sign of faith) - a five-pointed, radiant star, which is taken from the insignia of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. It reminds people of the spirit of faith in the Institute. The right lower division shows three chevrons symbolizing broken bones, reminding students of the bravery and zeal the Saint promoted. The left lower division shows the book of knowledge on top (with the Alpha and Omega inscribed) and a lamp below; together they symbolize the importance of education, something which Jean-Baptiste de la Salle emphasised. The shield stands with a compartment with supporters each of the French lily, as the Lasallian family originates in Rheims, France. The top features a ribbon with the name of the College, and a crest with a cross (Catholicism) and a crown (used to symbolize Hong Kong as a British Crown Colony before 1997). Below the shield are three shells symbolising baptism. The motto of the college is also found at the bottom of the badge. The combination of green and white has become the College's official colors over the years. Green represents Ireland's shamrock, while white represents France's fleur-de-lis. The Lasallian Brothers of the College mostly come from Ireland and France. The school rally is based on a traditional Irish song O'Donnell Ab√∫. Brother Marcian James Cullen (1868-1938), an Irish brother and director of St. Joseph's College in 1921, adapted the song and wrote the lyrics for the rally. Brother Marcian James also posted to other Lasallian Schools in Malaya and Singapore and the same song was used in a few other schools there as well. Notable Alumni Over a century and beyond, the school has been breeding all-rounded young men for the betterment of Hong Kong and the World, from Head of State, Nobel Laureate to Olympians.

Starting from a young age, people can make moral decisions about what is right and wrong; this makes morality fundamental to the human condition. Moral reasoning, however, is a part of morality that occurs both within and between individuals.Raine, A. & Yang, Y. (2006). Neural foundations of moral reasoning and antisocial behavior. Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience 1(3), 203-213. doi:10.1093/scan/nsl033 Prominent contributors to this theory include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. The term is sometimes used in a different sense: reasoning under conditions of uncertainty, such as those commonly obtained in a court of law. It is this sense that gave rise to the phrase, \\"To a moral certainty;\\"Victor v. Nebraska (92-8894), 511 U.S. 1(1994), from the syllabus, holding (c) and throughout, available in the Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection however, this idea is now seldom used outside of charges to juries. Moral reasoning can be defined as the process through which individuals try to determine the difference between what is right and wrong by using logic. This is an important and often daily process that people use when trying to do the right thing. For instance, every day people are faced with the dilemma of whether to lie in a given situation or not. People make this decision by reasoning the morality of their potential actions, and through weighing their actions against potential consequences. A moral choice can be a personal, economic, or ethical one; as described by some ethical code, or regulated by ethical relationships with others. This branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of descriptive ethics. There are many different forms of moral reasoning which often are dictated by culture. Cultural differences in the high-levels of cognitive function associated with moral reasoning can be observed through the association of brain networks from various cultures and their moral decision making. These cultural differences demonstrate the neural basis that cultural influences can have on an individual‚Äôs moral reasoning and decision making Sachdeva, S., Singh, P., & Medin, D. (2011). Culture and the quest for universal principals in moral reasoning. International Journal of Psychology, 46(3), 161-176. doi:10.1080/00207594.2011.568486. Distinctions between theories of moral reasoning can be accounted for by evaluating inferences (which tend to be either deductive or inductive) based on a given set of premises. Deductive inference reaches a conclusion that is true based on whether a given set of premises preceding the conclusion are also true, whereas, inductive inference goes beyond information given in a set of premises to base the conclusion on provoked reflection. This branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of descriptive ethics. There are many different moral reasonings. Moral reasoning is culturally defined, and thus is difficult to apply; yet human relationships define our existence and thus defy cultural boundaries. In philosophy Philosopher David Hume claims that morality is based more on perceptions than on logical reasoning. This means that people's morality is based more on their emotions and feelings than on a logical analysis of any given situation. Hume regards morals as linked to passion, love, happiness, and other emotions and therefore not based on reason. Jonathan Haidt agrees, arguing in his social intuitionist model that reasoning concerning a moral situation or idea follows an initial intuition. Haidt's fundamental stance on moral reasoning is that \\"moral intuitions (including moral emotions) come first and directly cause moral judgments\\"; he characterizes moral intuition as \\"the sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good-bad, like-dislike), without any conscious awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighing evidence, or inferring a conclusion\\". Immanuel Kant had a radically different view of morality. In his view, there are universal laws of morality that one should never break regardless of emotions. He proposes a four-step system to determine whether or not a given action was moral based on logic and reason. The first step of this method involves formulating \\"a maxim capturing your reason for an action\\". In the second step, one \\"frame[s] it as a universal principle for all rational agents\\". The third step is assessing \\"whether a world based on this universal principle is conceivable\\". If it is, then the fourth step is asking oneself \\"whether [one] would will the maxim to be a principle in this world\\". In essence, an action is moral if the maxim by which it is justified is one which could be universalized. For instance, when deciding whether or not to lie to someone for one's own advantage, one is meant to imagine what the world would be like if everyone always lied, and successfully so. In such a world, there would be no purpose in lying, for everybody would expect deceit, rendering the universal maxim of lying whenever it is to your advantage absurd. Thus, Kant argues that one should not lie under any circumstance. Another example would be if trying to decide whether suicide is moral or immoral; imagine if everyone committed suicide. Since mass international suicide would not be a good thing, the act of suicide is immoral. Kant's moral framework, however, operates under the overarching maxim that you should treat each person as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. This overarching maxim must be considered when applying the four aforementioned steps. Reasoning based on analogy is one form of moral reasoning. When using this form of moral reasoning the morality of one situation can be applied to another based on whether this situation is relevantly similar: similar enough that the same moral reasoning applies. A similar type of reasoning is used in common law when arguing based upon legal precedent. In consequentialism (often distinguished from deontology) actions are based as right on wrong based upon the consequences of action as opposed to a property intrinsic to the action itself.  In developmental psychology  Moral reasoning first attracted a broad attention from developmental psychologists in the mid-to-late 20th century. Their main theorization involved elucidating the stages of development of moral reasoning capacity. =Jean Piaget= Jean Piaget developed two phases of moral development, one common among children and the other common among adults. The first is known as the Heteronomous Phase. This phase, more common among children, is characterized by the idea that rules come from authority figures in one's life such as parents, teachers, and God. It also involves the idea that rules are permanent no matter what. Thirdly, this phase of moral development includes the belief that \\"naughty\\" behavior must always be punished and that the punishment will be proportional. The second phase in Piaget's theory of moral development is referred to as the Autonomous Phase. This phase is more common after one has matured and is no longer a child. In this phase people begin to view the intentions behind actions as more important than their consequences. For instance, if a person who is driving swerves in order to not hit a dog and then knocks over a road sign, adults are likely to be less angry at the person than if he or she had done it on purpose just for fun. Even though the outcome is the same, people are more forgiving because of the good intention of saving the dog. This phase also includes the idea that people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal. People in the Autonomous Phase also believe rules may be broken under certain circumstances. For instance, Rosa Parks broke the law by refusing to give up her seat on a bus, which was against the law but something many people consider moral nonetheless. In this phase people also stop believing in the idea of immanent justice. =Lawrence Kohlberg= Inspired by Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg made significant contributions to the field of moral reasoning by creating a theory of moral development. His theory is a \\"widely accepted theory that provides the basis for empirical evidence on the influence of human decision making on ethical behavior.\\" In Lawrence Kohlberg's view, moral development consists of the growth of less egocentric and more impartial modes of reasoning on more complicated matters. He believed that the objective of moral education is the reinforcement of children to grow from one stage to an upper stage. Dilemma was a critical tool that he emphasized that children should be presented with; yet also, the knowledge for children to cooperate. According to his theory, people pass through three main stages of moral development as they grow from early childhood to adulthood. These are pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality. Each of these is subdivided into two levels. The first stage in the pre-conventional level is obedience and punishment. In this stage people, usually young children, avoid certain behaviors only because of the fear of punishment, not because they see them as wrong. The second stage in the pre-conventional level is called individualism and exchange: in this stage people make moral decisions based on what best serves their needs. The third stage is part of the conventional morality level and is called interpersonal relationships. In this stage one tries to conform to what is considered moral by the society that they live in, attempting to be seen by peers as a good person. The fourth stage is also in the conventional morality level and is called maintaining social order. This stage focuses on a view of society as a whole and following the laws and rules of that society. The fifth stage is a part of the post-conventional level and is called social contract and individual rights. In this stage people begin to consider differing ideas about morality in other people and feel that rules and laws should be agreed on by the members of a society. The sixth and final stage of moral development, the second in the post-conventional level, is called universal principles. At this stage people begin to develop their ideas of universal moral principles and will consider them the right thing to do regardless of what the laws of a society are. =James Rest= In 1983, James Rest developed the four component Model of Morality, which addresses the ways that moral motivation and behavior occurs Lincoln, S. H. & Holmes, E. K. (2011). Ethical decision making: a process influenced by moral intensity. Journal of Healthcare, Science and the Humanities, 1(1), 55-69. doi:10.1111/j.1559-2011.tb02661.x. The first of these is moral sensitivity, which is \\"the ability to see an ethical dilemma, including how our actions will affect others\\".Lynn E. Swaner, \\"Ethical and Moral Reasoning,\\" Educating for Personal and Social Responsibility, Position Paper, American Council of Colleges and Universities, September 13, 2004 (pdf), citing James Rest, \\"Morality,\\" in Cognitive Development, ed. John H. Flavell and Ellen M. Markman, Handbook of Child Psychology volume 3, 4th ed. New York: Wiley, 1983, , pp. 556-629. The second is moral judgment, which is \\"the ability to reason correctly about what 'ought' to be done in a specific situation\\". The third is moral motivation, which is \\"a personal commitment to moral action, accepting responsibility for the outcome\\". The fourth and final component of moral behavior is moral character, which is a \\"courageous persistence in spite of fatigue or temptations to take the easy way out\\".  In social cognition  Based on empirical results from behavioral and neuroscientific studies, social and cognitive psychologists attempted to develop a more accurate descriptive (rather than normative) theory of moral reasoning. That is, the emphasis of research was on how real-world individuals made moral judgments, inferences, decisions, and actions, rather than what should be considered as moral. = Dual-process theory and social intuitionism = Developmental theories of moral reasoning were critiqued as prioritizing on the maturation of cognitive aspect of moral reasoning. From Kohlberg's perspective, one is considered as more advanced in moral reasoning as she is more efficient in using deductive reasoning and abstract moral principles to make moral judgments about particular instances. For instance, an advanced reasoner may reason syllogistically with the Kantian principle of 'treat individuals as ends and never merely as means' and a situation where kidnappers are demanding a ransom for a hostage, to conclude that the kidnappers have violated a moral principle and should be condemned. In this process, reasoners are assumed to be rational and have conscious control over how they arrive at judgments and decisions. In contrast with such view, however, Joshua Greene and colleagues argued that laypeople's moral judgments are significantly influenced, if not shaped, by intuition and emotion as opposed to rational application of rules. In their fMRI studies in the early 2000s,Greene, J. D., Sommerville, R. B., Nystrom, L. E., Darley, J. M., & Cohen, J. D. (2001). An fMRI investigation of emotional engagement in moral judgment. Science, 293(5537), 2105-2108., participants were shown three types of decision scenarios: one type included moral dilemmas that elicited emotional reaction (moral-personal condition), the second type included moral dilemmas that did not elicit emotional reaction (moral- impersonal condition), and the third type had no moral content (non-moral condition). Brain regions such as posterior cingulate gyrus and angular gyrus, whose activation is known to correlate with experience of emotion, showed activations in moral-personal condition but not in moral-impersonal condition. Meanwhile, regions known to correlate with working memory, including right middle frontal gyrus and bilateral parietal lobe, were less active in moral- personal condition than in moral-impersonal condition. Moreover, participants' neural activity in response to moral-impersonal scenarios was similar to their activity in response to non-moral decision scenarios. Another study used variants of trolley problem that differed in the 'personal/impersonal' dimension and surveyed people's permissibility judgment (Scenarios 1 and 2). Across scenarios, participants were presented with the option of sacrificing a person to save five people. However, depending on the scenario, the sacrifice involved pushing a person off a footbridge to block the trolley (footbridge dilemma condition; personal) or simply throwing a switch to redirect the trolley (trolley dilemma condition; impersonal). The proportions of participants who judged the sacrifice as permissible differed drastically: 11% (footbridge dilemma) vs. 89% (trolley dilemma). This difference was attributed to the emotional reaction evoked from having to apply personal force on the victim, rather than simply throwing a switch without physical contact with the victim. Focusing on participants who judged the sacrifice in trolley dilemma as permissible but the sacrifice in footbridge dilemma as impermissible, the majority of them failed to provide a plausible justification for their differing judgments. Based on these results, social psychologists proposed the dual process theory of morality. They suggested that our emotional intuition and deliberate reasoning are not only qualitatively distinctive, but they also compete in making moral judgments and decisions. When making an emotionally- salient moral judgment, automatic, unconscious, and immediate response is produced by our intuition first. More careful, deliberate, and formal reasoning then follows to produce a response that is either consistent or inconsistent with the earlier response produced by intuition,Haidt, J. (2012). The righteous mind: Why good people are divided by politics and religion. New York, NY: Paragon. in parallel with more general form of dual process theory of thinking. But in contrast with the previous rational view on moral reasoning, the dominance of the emotional process over the rational process was proposed. Haidt highlighted the aspect of morality not directly accessible by our conscious search in memory, weighing of evidence, or inference. He describes moral judgment as akin to aesthetic judgment, where an instant approval or disapproval of an event or object is produced upon perception. Hence, once produced, the immediate intuitive response toward a situation or person cannot easily be overridden by the rational consideration that follows. The theory explained that in many cases, people resolve inconsistency between the intuitive and rational processes by using the latter for post-hoc justification of the former. Haidt, using the metaphor \\"the emotional dog and its rational tail\\", applied such nature of our reasoning to the contexts ranging from person perception to politics. A notable illustration of the influence of intuition involved feeling of disgust. According to Haidt's moral foundations theory, political liberals rely on two dimensions (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity) of evaluation to make moral judgments, but conservatives utilize three additional dimensions (ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity). Among these, studies have revealed the link between moral evaluations based on purity/sanctity dimension and reasoner's experience of disgust. That is, people with higher sensitivity to disgust were more likely to be conservative toward political issues such as gay marriage and abortion. Moreover, when the researchers reminded participants of keeping the lab clean and washing their hands with antiseptics (thereby priming the purity/sanctity dimension), participants' attitudes were more conservative than in the control condition. Other studies raised criticism toward Haidt's interpretation of his data. Augusto Blasi also rebuts the theories of Jonathan Haidt on moral intuition and reasoning. He agrees with Haidt that moral intuition plays a significant role in the way humans operate. However, Blasi suggests that people use moral reasoning more than Haidt and other cognitive scientists claim. Blasi advocates moral reasoning and reflection as the foundation of moral functioning. Reasoning and reflection play a key role in the growth of an individual and the progress of societies. = Motivated reasoning = A theorization of moral reasoning similar to dual-process theory was put forward with emphasis on our motivations to arrive at certain conclusions. Ditto and colleaguesDitto, P. H., Pizarro, D. A., & Tannenbaum, D. (2009). Motivated moral reasoning. In B. H. Ross (Series Ed.) & D. M. Bartels, C. W. Bauman, L. J. Skitka, & D. L. Medin (Eds.), Psychology of learning and motivation, Vol. 50: Moral judgment and decision making (pp. 307-338). San Diego, CA: Academic Press likened moral reasoners in everyday situations to lay attorneys than lay judges; people do not reason in the direction from assessment of individual evidence to moral conclusion (bottom-up), but from a preferred moral conclusion to assessment of evidence (top-down). The former resembles the thought process of a judge who is motivated to be accurate, unbiased, and impartial in her decisions; the latter resembles that of an attorney who's goal is to win a dispute using partial and selective arguments. Kunda proposed motivated reasoning as a general framework for understanding human reasoning. She emphasized the broad influence of physiological arousal, affect, and preference (which constitute the essence of motivation and cherished beliefs) on our general cognitive processes including memory search and belief construction. Importantly, biases in memory search, hypothesis formation and evaluation result in confirmation bias, making it difficult for reasoners to critically assess their beliefs and conclusions. Applied to moral domain, our strong motivation to favor people we like leads us to recollect beliefs and interpret facts in ways that favor them. In Alicke (1992, Study 1), participants made responsibility judgments about an agent who drove over the speed limit and caused an accident. When the motive for speeding was described as moral (to hide a gift for his parents' anniversary), participants assigned less responsibility to the agent than when the motive was immoral (to hide a vial of cocaine). Even though the causal attribution of the accident may technically fall under the domain of objective, factual understanding of the event, it was nevertheless significantly affected by the perceived intention of the agent (which was presumed to have determined the participants' motivation to praise or blame him). Another paper by Simon, Stenstrom, and Read (2015, Studies 3 and 4) used a more comprehensive paradigm that measures various aspects of participants' interpretation of a moral event, including factual inferences, emotional attitude toward agents, and motivations toward the outcome of decision. Participants read about a case involving a purported academic misconduct and were asked to role-play as a judicial officer who must provide a verdict. A student named Debbie had been accused of cheating in an exam, but the overall situation of the incident was kept ambiguous to allow participants to reason in a desired direction. Then, the researchers attempted to manipulate participants' motivation to support either the university (conclude that she cheated) or Debbie (she did not cheat) in the case. In one condition, the scenario stressed that through previous incidents of cheating, the efforts of honest students have not been honored and the reputation of the university suffered (Study 4, Pro-University condition); in another condition, the scenario stated that Debbie's brother died from a tragic accident a few months ago, eliciting participants' motivation to support and sympathize with Debbie (Study 3, Pro-Debbie condition). Behavioral and computer simulation results showed an overall shift in reasoning--factual inference, emotional attitude, and moral decision--depending on the manipulated motivation. That is, when the motivation to favor the university/Debbie was elicited, participants' holistic understanding and interpretation of the incident shifted in the way that favored the university/Debbie. In these reasoning processes, situational ambiguity was shown to be critical for reasoners to arrive at their preferred conclusion. From a broader perspective, Holyoak and Powell interpreted motivated reasoning in the moral domain as a special pattern of reasoning predicted by coherence-based reasoning framework. This general framework of cognition, initially theorized by the philosopher Paul Thagard, argues that many complex, higher-order cognitive functions are made possible by computing the coherence (or satisfying the constraints) between psychological representations such as concepts, beliefs, and emotions. Coherence-based reasoning framework draws symmetrical links between consistent (things that co-occur) and inconsistent (things that do not co-occur) psychological representations and use them as constraints, thereby providing a natural way to represent conflicts between irreconcilable motivations, observations, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes, as well as moral obligations. Importantly, Thagard's framework was highly comprehensive in that it provided a computational basis for modeling reasoning processes using moral and non- moral facts and beliefs as well as variables related to both 'hot' and 'cold' cognitions. = Causality and intentionality = Classical theories of social perception had been offered by psychologists including Fritz Heider (model of intentional action)Heider, F. (1958). The psychology of interpersonal relations. New York: Wiley. and Harold Kelley (attribution theory). These theories highlighted how laypeople understand another person's action based on their causal knowledge of internal (intention and ability of actor) and external (environment) factors surrounding that action. That is, people assume a causal relationship between an actor's disposition or mental states (personality, intention, desire, belief, ability; internal cause), environment (external cause), and the resulting action (effect). In later studies, psychologists discovered that moral judgment toward an action or actor is critically linked with these causal understanding and knowledge about the mental state of the actor. Bertram Malle and Joshua Knobe conducted survey studies to investigate laypeople's understanding and use (the folk concept) of the word 'intentionality' and its relation to action. His data suggested that people think of intentionality of an action in terms of several psychological constituents: desire for outcome, belief about the expected outcome, intention to act (combination of desire and belief), skill to bring about the outcome, and awareness of action while performing that action. Consistent with this view as well as with our moral intuitions, studies found significant effects of the agent's intention, desire, and beliefs on various types of moral judgments, Using factorial designs to manipulate the content in the scenarios, Cushman showed that the agent's belief and desire regarding a harmful action significantly influenced judgments of wrongness, permissibility, punishment, and blame. However, whether the action actually brought about negative consequence or not only affected blame and punishment judgments, but not wrongness and permissibility judgments. Another study also provided neuroscientific evidence for the interplay between theory of mind and moral judgment. Through another set of studies, Knobe showed a significant effect in the opposite direction: Intentionality judgments are significantly affected by the reasoner's moral evaluation of the actor and action. In one of his scenarios, a CEO of a corporation hears about a new programme designed to increase profit. However, the program is also expected to benefit or harm the environment as a side effect, to which he responds by saying 'I don't care'. The side effect was judged as intentional by the majority of participants in the harm condition, but the response pattern was reversed in the benefit condition. Many studies on moral reasoning have used fictitious scenarios involving anonymous strangers (e.g., trolley problem) so that external factors irrelevant to researcher's hypothesis can be ruled out. However, criticisms have been raised about the external validity of the experiments in which the reasoners (participants) and the agent (target of judgment) are not associated in any way.Pizarro, D.A. & Tannenbaum, D. (2011). Bringing character back: How the motivation to evaluate character influences judgments of moral blame. In M. Mikulincer & Shaver, P. (Eds) The Social psychology of morality: Exploring the causes of good and evil. APA Press. As opposed to the previous emphasis on evaluation of acts, Pizarro and Tannenbaum stressed our inherent motivation to evaluate the moral characters of agents (e.g., whether an actor is good or bad), citing the Aristotelian virtue ethics. According to their view, learning the moral character of agents around us must have been a primary concern for primates and humans beginning from their early stages of evolution, because the ability to decide whom to cooperate with in a group was crucial to survival. Furthermore, observed acts are no longer interpreted separately from the context, as reasoners are now viewed as simultaneously engaging in two tasks: evaluation (inference) of moral character of agent and evaluation of her moral act. The person-centered approach to moral judgment seems to be consistent with results from some of the previous studies that involved implicit character judgment. For instance, in Alicke's (1992) study, participants may have immediately judged the moral character of the driver who sped home to hide cocaine as negative, and such inference led the participants to assess the causality surrounding the incident in a nuanced way (e.g., a person as immoral as him could have been speeding as well). In order to account for laypeople's understanding and use of causal relations between psychological variables, Sloman, Fernbach, and Ewing proposed a causal model of intentionality judgment based on Bayesian network. Their model formally postulates that character of agent is a cause for the agent's desire for outcome and belief that action will result in consequence, desire and belief are causes for intention toward action, and the agent's action is caused by both that intention and the skill to produce consequence. Combining computational modeling with the ideas from theory of mind research, this model can provide predictions for inferences in bottom-up direction (from action to intentionality, desire, and character) as well as in top-down direction (from character, desire, and intentionality to action).  Notes   Gender difference  At one time psychologists believed that men and women have different moral values and reasoning. This was based on the idea that men and women often think differently and would react to moral dilemmas in different ways. Some researchers hypothesized that women would favor care reasoning, meaning that they would consider issues of need and sacrifice, while men would be more inclined to favor fairness and rights, which is known as justice reasoning. However, some also knew that men and women simply face different moral dilemmas on a day-to-day basis and that might be the reason for the perceived difference in their moral reasoning. With these two ideas in mind, researchers decided to do their experiments based on moral dilemmas that both men and women face regularly. To reduce situational differences and discern how both genders use reason in their moral judgments, they therefore ran the tests on parenting situations, since both genders can be involved in child rearing. The research showed that women and men use the same form of moral reasoning as one another and the only difference is the moral dilemmas they find themselves in on a day-to-day basis. When it came to moral decisions both men and women would be faced with, they often chose the same solution as being the moral choice. At least this research shows that a division in terms of morality does not actually exist, and that reasoning between genders is the same in moral decisions.  References  Further reading * Haidt, J.

The first was the son of King Benjamin, king of the united Nephite-Zarahemla kingdom who lived in the 2nd century BC. Besides his genealogy, information about the first Helaman is limited. His brother, Mosiah, became heir to the throne.Book of Mormon, The second was a Nephite prophet and military leader who lived around the 1st century BC. He was the grandson of Alma and the oldest son of Alma (the younger), and was entrusted with maintaining a record of their people, the Nephites, as found in the Book of Alma. In LDS theology, he led into battle an army of two thousand young male warriors, which he referred to as his two thousand sons (two thousand stripling warriors). Most of the parts of the narrative involving Helaman come from the latter half of the Book of Alma. The third Helaman was the son of the above mentioned Helaman. He was a chief judge over the Nephites and was also responsible for maintaining a record of this people. The account that Helaman kept was recorded on the same records as his father. This record, however, was first given by Helaman (the father) to his brother Shiblon, who then handed the record down to his nephew, Helaman. The writings of this second Helaman are contained within the Book of Helaman. Etymology Brigham Young University proposes several etymologies for the name Helaman, including \\"Hammer of God\\".HELAMAN Known genealogy Early life Helaman was the eldest son of Alma the Younger, another Nephite prophet. The exact time and place of his birth are unknown. The house of his father, Alma, was in Zarahemla, the Nephite capital land, and Helaman may also have lived in Zarahemla. The Book of Mormon first mentions Helaman in Alma 31:7,The Book of Mormon. . and little is known of his life prior to this brief allusion. In this verse Helaman's father, Alma, and two younger brothers, Shiblon and Corianton, embark on a missionary journey to the Zoramites, but Helaman does not accompany them. This journey occurred towards the end of the 17th year of the \\"reign of the judges\\", which probably corresponds to about 75 BC.It can be concluded from the following verses that the journey took place in the 17th year of the reign of the judges: states that Korihor came into the land of Zarahemla in the latter end of the 17th year of the reign of the judges. show unambiguously that it was after Korihor's demise that the mission to the Zoramites took place.

Later life After their missionary labors among the Zoramites, Alma, his sons, and the rest of their company returned to Zarahemla.The Book of Mormon. . At this time Alma gathered his sons together to give each of them a charge.Book of Mormon., . In his charge to Helaman,Book of Mormon., Alma 36-37. Alma's charge to Helaman is contained in these two chapters. Alma recounts his own conversion, exhorts Helaman to righteousness, and confers stewardship of the sacred records and other artifacts (including the \\"interpreters\\", or Urim and Thummim).Book of Mormon to Helaman.Book of Mormon, . Alma had previously tried to give the records and artifacts to Nephihah, but Nephihah refused to take them. These sacred records were passed down from generation to generation throughout the history of the Nephites, with each generation adding the story of their own time. It was these records which Mormon and Moroni drew from and abridged when compiling the Book of Mormon. Helaman accepted the records and continued the record-keeping tradition. The section of the Book of Alma beginning at chapter 45 states that it is, \\"The account of the people of Nephi, and their wars and dissensions, in the days of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman, which he kept in his days.\\"Book of Mormon, . This section may possibly continue as far as chapter 62, wherein Helaman dies.Book of Mormon, . Following Alma's words to his sons, he and his sons (including, presumably, Helaman) went among the people for a time, preaching the word of God.Book of Mormon, . Shortly afterward, in the 19th year of the reign of the judges (c. 73 BC), Alma approached Helaman for an important conversation. In what some consider a good model for child-parent interviews, LDS leader Carlos Asay uses the example of the relationship of Alma and Helaman to instruct concerning parent-child interviews. Alma questioned Helaman, praised him for his beliefs, and blessed him. Alma also dictated to him a prophecy of the destruction of the Nephites, which Alma commanded him to record but not to make known until it was fulfilled.The Book of Mormon. . Not long after his charge to Helaman, Alma departed and was never heard of again.Book of Mormon, . After this, Helaman and his brethren went among the people declaring the word of God and appointing \\"priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.\\"Book of Mormon, . Dissension arose, allegedly due to the people's pride and riches, and the people thus would not heed the words of Helaman and his brethren.Book of Mormon, . For the next several years, Helaman worked as a high priest in the Church, though not necessarily as the high priest over the Church. Helaman's work suffered major set-backs during Amalickiah's rise,Book of Mormon, . but then prospered in the years following Amalickiah's departure from the Nephites to the Lamanites.Book of Mormon, and . Ministering to the Anti-Nephi-Lehies Helaman next appears in Alma 53, in the 26th year of the reign of the judges (c. 66 BC), trying to persuade the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, also known as Ammonites, not to take up arms.Book of Mormon, . Years earlier, upon their conversion to the gospel of Christ, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies had made an oath to God that they \\"never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood.\\"Book of Mormon, . The Nephites and the Lamanites were embroiled in war, and the Anti-Nephi-Lehies wished to join the conflict and fight alongside the Nephites. However, to do so would mean breaking the oath which they had made. Helaman \\"feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls.\\"Book of Mormon, . Overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies resigned themselves to being spectators in the conflict. However, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies had many sons who, unlike their fathers, had never entered into a covenant not to take up weapons of war. These sons also wished to fight for the Nephites and have Helaman as their leader. With no oath restricting them and the Nephites in desperate circumstances, they were permitted to do so. There is no indication prior to this in the text that Helaman had any military training whatsoever, and indeed he may not have. Certainly, the sons of the Anti-Nephi- Lehies had no fighting experience.Book of Mormon, . Regardless, the interesting turn of events made Helaman have the Anti-Nephi-Lehies marching at the head of an army of two thousand soldiers. LDS leader Richard J. Maynes cited the entire episode in a General Conference as containing good examples of covenant-keeping behavior. Commander of the Stripling Warriors Helaman's army of two thousand young men is often referred to as the two thousand stripling warriors, or the sons of Helaman. Theirs is one of the most well-known stories from the Book of Mormon. In brief, Helaman and his band marched in the 26th year of the reign of the judges (c. 66 BC) to the western part of the land of the Nephites and there joined the existing Nephite forces.The Book of Mormon. . There they played a pivotal role in some crucial Nephite victories. As a result of those victories, the Nephites regained possession of all of the western cities which had been taken by the Lamanites.Book of Mormon, . Although two of their battles were very bloody, the army of Helaman did not incur a single fatality.Helaman's epistle to Moroni in The Book of Mormon describes two particularly severe battles in which Helaman's army was involved. The first was outside the city of Antiparah (described in ). The second was in defense of the city of Cumeni (described in ) in the 29th year of the reign of the judges (c. 63 BC), ). Helaman attributed this to divine preservation.The Book of Mormon. . Helaman wrote an epistle to the captain of the Nephite armies, Moroni, informing him of their success and expressing confusion that the government did not send more troops and support to the western front.Book of Mormon, Alma 56-58. Moroni received the epistle in the 30th year of the reign of the judges (c. 62 BC).Book of Mormon, . The next year the Nephites successfully drove the Lamanites back into the land southward and thus the war ended at last.Book of Mormon, , and . Last years After the war ended in the 31st year of the reign of the judges (c. 61 BC), Helaman first briefly \\"returned to the place of his inheritance\\".Book of Mormon, . He then went forth with his brethren, preaching the word of God and establishing the Church.Book of Mormon, . About four years later, in the 35th year of the reign of the judges (c. 57 BC), Helaman died. At the time of his death, Helaman had not yet formally conferred stewardship of the sacred records and artifacts to his son, Helaman, as would have been traditional.

Construction and design In 1897, the Russian Admiralty, as part of a programme to reinforce the Imperial Russian Navy's Far East Fleet, published specifications for a fast protected cruiser, capable of commerce raiding. The ships were required to be armed with 152 mm (6-inch) quick-firing guns, and to have a speed of . Russian shipyards were already busy, and the Imperial Admiralty placed an order with the American shipyard William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia on 11 April 1898 to build a single cruiser, Varyag against this specification. Single ships were also ordered from the German shipyards Germaniawerft () and AG Vulcan () against these specifications. Varyag was laid down in October 1898, was launched on 31 October 1899 and commissioned into the Imperial Russian Navy on 2 January 1901, under the command of Captain Vladimir Behr. Varyag was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of at normal displacement. Design displacement was with full load displacement about . Thirty Niclausse water-tube boilers fed steam to two sets of four-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines rated at which drove two 3-bladed propellers. As a protected cruiser, the main protection consisted of an arched armoured deck which protected the ship's engines and magazines. The deck was thick in the central horizontal portion, and thick in the sloping sections towards the ship's sides. The ship's conning tower was protected by , with protecting the ammunition hoists and for the bow and stern torpedo tubes. The ship's main armament was twelve Obukhoff 152 mm (6-inch) L/45 guns, with two guns side by side on the ship's forecastle, two side-by-side on the quarterdeck, and the remaining eight on sponsons on the ship's upper deck. These guns could fire a shell to a range of , and at a rate of 6 rounds per gun. 2388 rounds of 152 mm ammunition were carried. Twelve 75 mm (2.95 in) L/50 QF guns defended the ship against torpedo boats, and could fire a shell to a range of at a rate of 10 rounds per minute. Close-in defence was provided by four Hotchkiss 47 mm revolving cannon on fighting tops, with four more on the upper deck, backed up by two 37 mm guns and two machine guns. Two Baranowski 64 mm landing guns were also carried for on-shore use by the ship's marines. Six 381 mm (15 inch) torpedo tubes were carried, two on each beam and one in the bow and stern. During her construction, an assistant physician, Leo Alexandroff, left the ship's advance party on 20 April 1899, and applied for U.S. citizenship. He was arrested for desertion. His case reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in Tucker v. Alexandroff that the ship, though not accepted for service in the Imperial Russian Navy, was a warship under the terms of the 1832 treaty between Russia and the United States.Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U.S. 424. Service Varyag damaged after the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, just before being scuttled. Varyag after being salvaged by the Japanese. Varyag in Japanese service as Soya. During the Battle of Chemulpo Bay at the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Varyag (under the command of Captain of the First Rank Vsevolod Rudnev) found itself in battle, engaged with the heavily superior Japanese squadron of Admiral Uriu, (one armoured cruiser, five protected cruisers and eight destroyers) in a heroic attempt to break out from Chemulpo (Incheon) harbour 9 February 1904. Chemulpo was in neutral Korean waters. Admiral Uriu gave the Russian ships in harbor a written ultimatum to sail by 12:00 noon or be attacked in the harbor itself. Captain Rudnev sortied, accompanied by the gunboat Koreets; having lost 31 men dead, 191 injured (out of 570) and outgunned, both ships returned to harbor by 1:00 p.m., the crew decided not to surrender, but to sink the ship. The crew was saved by transferring them to the British cruiser , the French cruiser Pascal, and the Italian cruiser ; the captain of the US gunboat declined doing so as a violation of U.S. neutrality.Port Arthur: Prologue materials of publishing house \\"Alexander PRINT\\"Report from Robert S. McCormack to Secretary of State John Hay, May 11, 1904, in Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1904, Government Printing House, Washington In 1907, Vsevolod Rudnev (by that time dismissed from Russian naval service in the rank of rear admiral) was decorated with the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun for his heroism in that battle; although he accepted the order, he never wore it in public. Varyag was later salvaged by the Japanese and repaired. She served with the Imperial Japanese Navy as the protected cruiser . During World War I, Russia and Japan were allies and several ships were transferred by the Japanese to the Russians. She was repurchased by the Imperial Russian Navy at Vladivostok on 5 April 1916 and renamed back to Varyag. In June, she departed for Murmansk via the Indian Ocean, arriving in November 1916. She was sent to Liverpool in Great Britain for an overhaul by Cammell Laird in February 1917, and was due to re-enter service with the Arctic squadron of the Russian Navy. However, following the Russian October Revolution on 7 November 1917 crewmen who had remained onboard hoisted the red flag and refused to set sail. On 8 December 1917 she was seized by a detachment of British soldiers. Assigned to the Royal Navy in February 1918, she ran aground while under tow off of Ireland, but was refloated and used as a hulk until 1919. She was then sold to a German firm in 1920 for scrap, but on 5 February 1920 ran aground on rocks near the Scottish village of Lendalfoot () in the Firth of Clyde, while being towed to Germany. She was scrapped in place from 1923-1925.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 407-408. Legacy Soviet postage stamp of 1972 honoring the cruiser Varyag The stoicism of Varyags crew at Chemulpo has inspired the Austrian poet Rudolf Greinz to write a poem dedicated to Varyag. The Russian translation of this poem was put on music by A.S. Turischev. The result was the 1904 song that remains popular today: > (German original) > Auf Deck, Kameraden, all' auf Deck! > Heraus zur letzten Parade! > Der stolze Warjag ergibt sich nicht, > Wir brauchen keine Gnade! > Rudolf Greinz (Russian poetic translation) > –ù–∞–≤–µ—Ä—Ö –≤—ã, —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—â–∏, –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞–º! > –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –ø–∞—Ä–∞–¥ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–µ—Ç. > –í—Ä–∞–≥—É –Ω–µ —Å–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞—à –≥–æ—Ä–¥—ã–π ‚Äú–í–∞—Ä—è–≥‚Äù, > –ü–æ—â–∞–¥—ã –Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –∂–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç. > > > (translation) > Get up you comrades, take your places, > The final parade is at hand. > Proud \\"Varyag\\" will not surrender to the enemy, > No one wants their mercy. The Varyag memorial at Lendalfoot looks over the Firth of Clyde. On Sunday 30 July 2006 (Russian Navy Day), a memorial plaque to the cruiser was unveiled at Lendalfoot in a ceremony attended by senior Russian politicians and navy personnel, veterans and local dignitaries.Resting place of Russian cruiser Varyag South Ayrshire Council News On 8 September 2007 a monument in the form of a large bronze cross was unveiled as an addition to the Lendalfoot memorial, in a ceremony attended by former Nato Secretary General George Robertson, British and Russian navy officers and diplomats. The ‚ÄúCruiser Varyag‚Äù Charity Foundation had organised a competition in Russia for the design of the monument, and RT International described it as \\"the first monument to Russian military glory in the UK\\". In 2010, as a gesture marking the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea and Russia, the flag of Varyag was restored. The Japanese Navy recovered the flag when the ship was salvaged; and the Incheon Metropolitan Museum acquired them after Japan's defeat at the end of World War II. The return of the flag takes the form of a two-year renewable loan because of the Korean law protecting cultural assets. \\"Korea to Return Flag of Sunken Russian Warship,\\" Chosun Ilbo (ROK).

Operations began in February 1946 under quadripartite flight rules Paragraph 4. Paragraph 4 of the rules begins: \\"The Berlin Air Safety Centre has been established in the Allied Control Authority Building with the object of ensuring safety of flights for all aircraft in the Berlin area. BASC regulates all flying in the Berlin control zone and also in the corridors extending from Berlin to the boundaries of adjacent control zones.\\" The Four-Power's controller desks, located in the Berlin Air Safety Centre. The BASC was one of two four-power organizations to continue functioning following the onset of the Cold War, the other being Spandau Prison, which ceased operations following the death of Rudolf Hess on 17 August 1987. The BASC continued to ensure safety of flight, for 24 hours a day, with the three western powers being represented by a chief controller, along with a deputy and general duty controller; all were Air Force officers. The Soviets, in attempt to mitigate being out numbered, had both a controller and interpreter on duty until its closing on 31 December 1990, following the lapse of Allied responsibilities in Berlin. The Kammergericht building, location of the Berlin Air Safety Centre. The BASC was located in the former Allied Control Authority building, also known as the Kammergericht Building, on Kleistpark, Berlin. The BASC coordinated air traffic in and out of Berlin and was responsible for air safety in the three corridors established in 1946 as well as in the Berlin control zone, the airspace within a radius of a pillar located in the cellar of the Allied Control Authority building. Each of the three corridors were wide and linked Berlin with the Western Zones of Occupation of Germany (later West Germany). The three corridors were usually open, without restriction, only to the Four Power nations: United Kingdom, United States, France and USSR ‚Äì other nations wishing to use the corridors had first to request and obtain permission from the BASC. Requests to use the southern corridor were handled by the US desk, the centre corridor by the French desk, and the northern corridor by the UK desk. The requests were then handed to the USSR desk for coordination, with Soviet air defense authorities, and in turn would be stamped in one of three ways: permission granted, safety of flight guaranteed; permission granted, safety of flight not guaranteed; or permission denied. The Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Centre (BARTCC) in 1987. Coordinating closely with the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Centre (BARTCC) facilities at Tempelhof Air Base, BASC personnel were responsible for logging protests of infringements upon Allied air corridors, and fielded the political ramifications of Eastern Bloc defectors escaping into West Berlin by aircraft. Tensions reached an understandable high during the Berlin Airlift in 1948-49, though the success of the campaign was in large part due to the coordination carried out within the BASC.

An amalgamation of Ogun and both versions of Silver Samurai from the comics, he is depicted as the Yashida clan's technology empire's original founder, Wolverine's old acquaintance, Shingen Yashida's father, Mariko Yashida's grandfather and Yukio's foster father. As a young man in the Japanese military, Ichir≈ç's life was saved by Logan during the United States' atomic bombing of Nagasaki and even offered his personal sword as gratitude. As an old man dying of cancer, Yashida arranged to be visited by Logan before seemingly passing with a family suit of samurai armor (referred to as the Silver Samurai) at his funeral as a symbolic guardian. Unfortunately, his successor being Mariko instead of Shingen leads to his son's own plans. In actuality, Yashida faked his death and equipped himself into his own giant robotic adamantium Silver Samurai suit which wields a katana and a wakizashi (both of which are adamantium and can generate heat) with Dr. Green and Kenuichio Harada as enforcers.

Built and owned by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, it was later operated by London's Metropolitan Railway, and in 1933 briefly became one of the two north-western termini of the London Underground, despite being and over two hours' travelling time from the City of London. Approximately of a mile (1.2 km) north of Brill, the station was opened in March 1872 as the result of lobbying from local residents and businesses. As the line was cheaply built and ungraded and the locomotives were of poor quality, services were very slow, initially taking 1 hour 45 minutes to traverse the six miles (10 km) from Brill to the junction station with main line services at Quainton Road. Although serving a lightly populated area and little-used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a carrier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury and London. A brickworks was also attached to the station, but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening. During the 1890s, plans were made to extend the tramway to Oxford, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899, and the line became one of the railway's two north-western termini. It was upgraded and better-quality locomotives were introduced making the journey time three times faster. In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was felt that there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive. Wotton Tramway On 23 September 1868 the small Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A&BR;) opened, linking the Great Western Railway's station at Aylesbury to the London and North Western Railway's Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction.Connor (2000), p.47 On 1 September 1894, London's Metropolitan Railway (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR; line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at Baker Street began on 1 January 1897. Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR;'s line at Quainton Road.Oppitz (2000), p.73 The first stage of the route, known as the Wotton Tramway, was a line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood,Horne (2003), p.18 and opened on 1 April 1871.Demuth (2003), p.6 Intended for use by horse trams, the line was built with longitudinal sleepers, to avoid horses tripping.Oppitz (2000), p.74 =Extension to Brill= Circle line in London, shown at the bottom of the map. The blue bar marks the northern limit of London Underground operations after 1936, and the black bar the limit of LU operations after 1961.alt=Map of a long railway line, ending at one end in a fork to two termini, and at the other end in a loop with a number of closely packed stations. Lobbying from the nearby town of Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to a new terminus at the foot of Brill Hill, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself, in March 1872. Two mixed trains each day ran in each direction.Oppitz (2000), p.75Foxell (2010), p.155 With the extension to Brill opened the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter locomotives built to a modified traction engine design, each with a top speed of ,Simpson (2005), p.70 although a speed limit of was enforced. The Duke died in 1889. In 1894, the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC;) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built.Simpson (2005), p.72 The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.;Demuth (2003), p.18 Services and facilities Brill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened,Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ß44 and owing to the town's hilltop setting the station was of a mile (1.2 km) from Brill itself. Brill railway station was small, with a single low platform.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßXII At its opening there was one station building, which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal, and ticket office.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ß45 Next to it was a siding that led to a cattle pen. Two cottages for station staff were built near the station in 1871. A third cottage across the road from the station was built in 1885, possibly to serve as an office. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage. =Passenger services= From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßiv Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until its closure in 1935. Limited by poor-quality locomotives and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains needed 1 hour 45 minutes to travel the six miles from Brill to the junction station at Quainton Road.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßv Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better-quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes. Serving a lightly populated area, and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little use by passengers; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at Wood Siding) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only ¬£191 (about ¬£ in ) in passenger receipts.Jackson (2006), p.134 =Goods facilities= Although little-used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ß46 In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury.Simpson (2005), p.111 Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889. In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, which became the Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works was unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a timber yard in the 1920s. Closure On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways except for the small Waterloo & City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). Thus, despite it being and over two hours' travel from the City of London, Brill station became a terminus of the London Underground network.Foxell (2010), p.66 Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes,Foxell (2010), p.72 concluding that over ¬£2,000 (about ¬£ in ) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway.Horne (2003), p.55 As a consequence, the LPTB decided to withdraw all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935;Foxell (2010), p.73 the last services ran on 30 November. alt=Photo Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired, and the railway and stations reverted to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company.Horne (2003), p.56 With no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&ATC; was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The former goods shed at Brill sold for ¬£7 10s (about ¬£ in ), and a railway-owned house attached to Brill station fetched ¬£350 (about ¬£ in ).

Marstal, also known as the \\"skipper village\\", from its being the home of so many sailors and captains, is the island's largest town today and is its principal commercial and shopping centre. The countryside is for the most part gently undulating, and there is a several-kilometre-long stretch of 33-metre-high cliffs at Voderup Klint on the west coast. With its generally low traffic density, √Ür√∏ is a popular destination for hikers and cyclists. The island's beaches also attract anglers and artists. As one of the islands making up the South Funen Archipelago, √Ür√∏ is favoured by particularly fine weather. It enjoys a higher number of sunshine hours than the average for the rest of Denmark, and the year-round temperature is also a few degrees above the national average. At Olde M√∏lle, at one of √Ür√∏'s highest points and near the centre of the island, the sculptor Erik Brandt has created a \\"peace bench\\", conceived with the intention of providing people with an opportunity to survey the island and its surrounding sea, whilst pondering on the theme of world peace.  History  The flag of √Ür√∏ In the town of √Ür√∏sk√∏bing Bregninge church Archaeological excavations provide evidence of settlements going back to before 8000 BC. There are some burial mounds on the island, as well as an old Ting place. Relics of antiquity are found all over the island. Burial mounds, passage graves, and dolmens bear witness of human activity through more than 10,000 years. As for its more recent history, the period of the duchies is of special interest. During this period ‚Äî from the 14th century to the year 1864 ‚Äì √Ür√∏ was united and separated, alternately, into a number of enclaves. √Ür√∏ was outside the tariff wall of the Kingdom, leading to flourishing smuggling which was a way of living for many of √Ür√∏'s inhabitants. In 1629 the main town of √Ür√∏sk√∏bing burnt down in a great fire. There was no other disaster of comparable scale. In 1750 the island, previously split into exclaves of numerous duchies, was united as single administrative district. Until 1864, √Ür√∏ was part of the Danish Duchy of Schleswig ‚Äì the area of Schleswig/Southern Jutland is now divided between Denmark (Northern Schleswig) and Germany (Southern Schleswig). King Christian IV's cousin, also named Christian, was the Duke of √Ür√∏ from 1622 to 1633, and lived with his concubine Cathrine Griebels at Gr√•sten Manor House. When the Duke died, a banner was found at Gr√•sten composed of nine pieces of cloth and in three colours ‚Äì body colour, sea green, and golden yellow. This banner has provided the inspiration for the flag of √Ür√∏ which is seen today all over the island. When Duke Christian died, √Ür√∏ was distributed among four of his brothers, and this offers one explanation of why two towns developed in the island, √Ür√∏sk√∏bing and later on Marstal, and why each came to be in their own \\"country\\". Gr√•sten Manor House was abolished in 1766 and the buildings were demolished. The name of Gr√•sten is still alive today in the farmhouse that stands almost on the same spot as the ducal manor. Gr√•sten of today offers bed and breakfast accommodation. In 1750, √Ür√∏ was united, and has not since been separated. This is marked by the memorial stone at Olde M√∏lle (English = Ancient mill). At the union, the old Code of Jutland from 1241 was applied and even today some of those rules are still valid. In recent history, the preservation of the area's local heritage has been paramount among residents. This passion for √Ür√∏ was demonstrated in 2000 when the Marstal Maritime School was ordered to close. More than 2,000 islanders (a third of the island) traveled to Copenhagen to protest the closing of the historic school. Ultimately, the government allowed the Maritime School to remain open.

It provides a third of Marstal's power consumption. √Ür√∏ is endeavoring to become self-sufficient in energy, and in 2002 a figure of 40% self-sufficiency in renewable energy was reached. The initiatives have attracted high international recognition and √Ür√∏ is considered to be one of the world's leaders in the field. As of January 2013, the solar plant covers an area of 33,300 m2 as a result of an extension under the Sunstone 4 project.\\"Beskrivelse af energisystemet i Marstal Fjernvarme\\", Marstal Fjernvarme.

With the recent expansion, the system in Marstal is now the world's largest solar collector system for heating. In 2002, three modern wind turbines were erected. The wingtip of these turbines is above the ground and between them the mills cover 50% of the island's electricity consumption. 28 January 2015 - The EU Horizon 2020 administration has confirmed that the 17 million ‚Ç¨ application for a demonstration E-ferry is now in the state of Grant Agreement - meaning that the partners in the Horizon application now have 3 months to finish contracting for the subsidies.

Porter's enrollment for 2017‚Äì18 academic year was 313; 200 boarding students, and 113 day students. Known for its nationally and internationally diverse population, the school draws students from 21 states, 31 countries (with dual-citizenship and/or residence), and 17 countries (citizenship alone). All told, international students comprised 14% as of the 2017‚Äì18 year. Average class size is 10.  History  =Origins= Sarah Porter, the founder of Miss Porter's School Miss Porter's School was established in 1843 by education reformer Sarah Porter, who recognized the importance of women's education. She was insistent that the school's curriculum include chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the more traditional Latin, French, German, spelling, reading, arithmetic, trigonometry, history, and geography. Also encouraged were such athletic opportunities as tennis, horseback riding, and in 1867 the school formed its own baseball team, the Tunxises. In 1884, Sarah Porter hired her former student, Mary Elizabeth Dunning Dow, with whom she began to share more of her duties as Head of School. From then until her death in 1900, Miss Porter gradually relinquished her control of the school to Mrs. Dow. Sarah Porter's will named her nephew, Dr. Robert Porter Keep, as executor of her estate, of which the school was the most valuable asset. Mrs. Dow's compensation for her position as sole Head of School was also specified in the will. As executor, Dr. Keep began extensive repairs and renovations to the school. While Mrs. Dow continued to receive a salary as per Porter's will, she became convinced that Dr. Keep, in diverting the school's income to pay for construction, was enriching his inheritance with funds that were rightfully hers. The conflict escalated and culminated in Mrs. Dow's resignation in 1903. She moved to Briarcliff, New York, taking with her as many as 140 students and 16 faculty members, and began Mrs. Dow's School for Girls, which would come to be known as Briarcliff Junior College only to be absorbed by Pace University in 1977. A banner hanging in a themed guest room in the Timothy Cowles House, at Miss Porter's School, gives insight into how Porter's girls lived during the mid 1900s Dr. Keep announced in July 1903 that the school would reopen in October of that year with his wife, Elizabeth Vashti Hale Keep as Head of School, eleven teachers, and between five and sixteen students in attendance. After Dr. Keep succumbed to pneumonia and died on July 3, 1904, Mrs. Keep continued his legacy of renovation and construction. One of her many legacies was the establishment of a kindergarten for children of her employees. The kindergarten, on Garden Street, is now home to the Village Cooperative Nursery School, and is no longer connected with Miss Porter's School. When Mrs. Keep died of influenza on March 28, 1917, leadership of the school passed to her stepson, Robert Porter Keep, Jr., who moved to Farmington from Andover, Massachusetts where he had been teaching German at Phillips Academy. From 1917 until the school's Centennial, in 1943, he and his wife, RoseAnne Day Keep, remained Heads of School at Miss Porter's. Mr. Keep appointed members to the first Board of Trustees including: * Wilmarth S. Lewis, Yale's Horace Walpole scholar * Annie Burr Auchincloss Lewis 1920 (Wilmarth Lewis's wife) * The Rev. Palfrey Perkins, a senior minister at King's Chapel * Lewis Perry, headmaster of Phillips Exeter Academy * George H. Richards, a lawyer and Mr. Keep's classmate at Yale The school was incorporated as a non-profit institution during the school's Centennial in 1943, with the primary purpose as a college preparatory school rather than its previous reputation as a finishing school for the social elite. Also in 1943, the school ended the tradition of choosing a successive Head of School from the Porter family tree, selecting as its Head Ward L. Johnson and his wife Katharine. Academics Classes at Porter's are held Monday through Friday, with Wednesday as a half day. Porter's has a student-to-teacher ratio of about 8:1. Porter's utilizes a style of teaching similar to the Harkness Method, wherein students and teachers sit around an oval table for discussion-based humanities courses. STEM courses take place in traditional classrooms and/or labs, while arts are taught in studio. Students are required to take courses in the arts, computer science, English, ethical leadership, history, modern or classical languages, mathematics, and science. Typically, students take a total of five to six units of credit per semester. On May 19, 2011, the Online School for Girls announced that Miss Porter's School and School of the Holy Child in Rye, New York had become consortium members. Three Porter's faculty members are currently listed as teachers on the OSG website. Finances =Tuition and financial aid= Miss Porter's offers need-based financial aid as well as a variety of merit scholarships. The school reports that, for the 2017‚Äì18 school year, roughly 34 percent of the student body receives some form of financial aid, with a total of over $3.3 million in aid awarded, although fewer than 2% of the student body receive a full scholarship. In 2018, 37% of students received some form of need-based financial aid. =Endowment= As of 2018, the school's endowment was estimated at $113 million. The school is undergoing a capital campaign in 2018 to support a more consolidated campus that harkens back to its original roots. The campus at one time incorporated more than 90 buildings, most of which were in historical districts in Farmington and/or on the National Registry of Historic Buildings. Consolidating the campus supports the school's mission of educating young women for the future, while incorporating its rich past as the school celebrated its 175-year anniversary. Campus facilities =Academic facilities= *The Main building, the front door of which is depicted on the school seal, was built in 1830 as the Union Hotel on Main Street. Originally intended to serve patrons of the nearby Farmington Canal, it was rented by Sarah Porter in 1848 until her purchase on April 19, 1866. * The M. Burch Tracy Ford Library, one of the newer academic facilities on campus, is named for the school's eleventh Head of School and houses over 22,000 volumes, electronic books, magazines, journals, newspapers in addition to a collection of 1,308 academic and entertainment DVDs and videos. The building also houses a computer lab and eight study rooms. * Hamilton, previously a dorm, is currently home to the English and History departments. It was named for the Hamilton sisters, primarily Alice and Edith. * Jones Memorial, previously a pharmacy before the school's founding, is home to the language department, where students can enroll in Spanish, Latin, French, or Mandarin. * Olin, the main building for mathematics, science, and arts. This building is home to the school seal, which only seniors are allowed to step on. =Athletic facilities= * The Student Recreation Center, designed by Tai Soo Kim and built in 1991, includes the Wean Student Center (a gift of the Raymond John Wean Foundation), Crisp Gymnasium with an elevated running track, a weight and exercise room, an athletic training room, and four previous squash courts which have since been converted into an Erg room, a free weight room, and a climbing wall. * The Mellon Gymnasium, designed by Maxwell Moore and built in 1962 as part of the theater-gymnasium complex, was a gift of the Richard King Mellon Foundation. It is home to Varsity Badminton in the fall, JV and Thirds Basketball in the winter, and is the designated indoor practice space for Varsity and JV Softball in the spring. It is also the official home of the Minks, Possums, and Squirrels, intercampus primarily sports rivalries that each New Girl is assigned to during one of the Fall Traditions. Outside of the Gymnasium, there is a statue for each of the three groups. * The Gaines Dance Barn, built c. 1930 and remodeled in 1993, is the facility that serves as both rehearsal and performance space for dance groups. In March 1998, the facility was acoustically treated following complications stemming from the 1993 remodel. * The Pool & Squash Building was designed and built by Stanmar Inc. in 2007. As the newest athletic facility on campus, it contains an eight- lane, pool and eight international squash courts, and is nicknamed the \\"Cool House,\\" as a combination of terms \\"Court\\" and \\"Pool House.\\" It also contains multi-function rooms that are frequently used for receptions for Ancients, Trustees, and guests. * The Farmington Boat House, a cold storage boathouse on the nearby Farmington River, is home to the Varsity and JV Crew teams of both Miss Porter's and Farmington High School, shared in a unique public-private relationship. The program is equipped with six Vespoli fours, a pair/double and three recreational singles.

At the end of each season, Porter's competes against the league's most competitive teams in the New England Championships. Porter's traditional rival is The Ethel Walker School. =Championships= Crew In 1997, the Crew Team ranked 1st in the New England Championships. In 2009, the Varsity Crew Team placed fourth in the New England Championships. Squash In 2012, the Varsity Squash team placed fourth in New England Championships. Following the 2014 NEISA Team Championships, Varsity Squash ranked 8th out of 16 teams in Division A of the New England Interscholastic Squash Association (NEISA). Participation in the 2014 NEISA Individual Championships earned the team 74 points and 6th Place overall. Volleyball In 2010, the Varsity Volleyball team defeated Convent of the Sacred Heart to become the 2010 New England School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) Class B Champions. Swimming The Porter's Girls Swimming and Diving team went undefeated in their 2019/2020 season. Then, they proceeded to make history by winning their Founder's league championships for the first time and breaking numerous records. To conclude their season, Porter's swimming and diving also took home the win for their New England Championships. For the second year in a row, they competed against several teams in the state region, broke some more records, and took home another dub. Student life =Residential life= Approximately 75% of Porter's girls live in dormitories, all but one of which are former Farmington private residences left to the school. Each dormitory has a house director who lives in a private suite or apartment in the dorm, often with his/her family. One of the school's distinguishing features is that house directors' primary responsibilities are within residential houses. Each dormitory, with the exception of the two senior dorms, has two Junior Advisors who serve as peer counselors and mediators. All student residences are equipped with the TellEmotion Polar Bear Program, technology developed at Dartmouth College, in order to encourage conscientious energy consumption among students. Each display features an animated polar bear at various degrees of comfort or distress depending on the building's current energy consumption. Additionally, students can monitor their dorm's progress and even compare it to that of other dorms using the software's graphical analysis feature. =Student publications= * Salmagundy is the school's student-run monthly newspaper, founded October 27, 1945. Salmagundy is now both an online and paper publication. * The school's journal for scholarly writing, Chautauqua, sharing its name with the US adult education movement, offers publication examples of student research across a variety of academic disciplines. * The school's yearbook, Daeges Eage, literally translates from Old English to \\"eye of the day,\\" from which the modern word \\"daisy\\" is derived. * Haggis/Baggis, the school's magazine for literature and fine arts, features student poems, short stories, photographs, and artwork. Since it was first published in 1967, the magazine has received numerous awards and recognitions. * The Language Literary Magazine is a yearly publication which showcases writings by foreign language students, including essays, poems, commentaries, and dialogues.

They asked the Supreme Court of Canada to answer the question, \\"Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, include female persons?\\" in the case Edwards v Canada. The five women, Emily Murphy, Irene Marryat Parlby, Nellie Mooney McClung, Louise Crummy McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards, created a petition in an effort to have women considered legally as a person, so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927, although the Supreme Court of Canada passed a decision that women are not such persons. This judgement was overturned by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the \\"Persons Case\\". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a larger drive for political equality. Some saw this as \\"radical change\\"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the 1689 Bill of Rights, which uses only the term person, not the term man (or woman for that matter). Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the Canadian constitution, an approach that has come to be known as the \\"living tree doctrine\\". History From 1917 to 1927, successive Canadian governments have suggested that they wanted to appoint a woman to the Senate, although all have pointed out that section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867 made it impossible. In August 1927, Emily Murphy invited four women activists; including Nellie McClung, Irene Parlby, Louise McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards to her home in Edmonton. The group, later known as the Famous Five, discussed plans to petition the Canadian government to submit a reference question to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the interpretation of the word persons in the British North America Act. Under section 60 of the British North America Act, the government may be directed to seek an interpretation of the constitution from the supreme court, if it receives a petition to do so from at least five people. Chambers of the Senate of Canada in Centre Block. Women were made eligible for the Senate after a petition from the Famous Five resulted in a court decision that concluded the term persons encompassed women. On 27 August 1927, a petition was sent to the Governor General of Canada, signed by the Famous Five. The petition requested that the government ask the supreme court if power was vested in the governor general in council, the prime minister of Canada, or both, to appoint a woman to the Senate of Canada; and if it was constitutionally possible to make provisions that would allow for the appointment of a woman. In response to the petition, the Canadian government brought forward the question \\"if the term persons in section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, include female persons\\" to the supreme court. On 24 April 1928, a decision was made by the supreme court that the word persons in the British North America Act did not encompass women. The ruling was based on the premise that the term should be interpreted in the same way as in 1867, and that the act would have specifically mentioned women if they had meant to make an exception for the Senate. The decision of the supreme court was later successfully appealed by the five through the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The decision was overturned on 18 October 1929, where it concluded that the term persons does encompass women. John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey, the justice who delivered the judgement, noted that, As a result of the decision, women were legally recognized as persons, and may no longer be denied their rights based on a narrow interpretation of the term. The decision also provided another step towards gender equality, with women now able to pursue legislative recourse through the Senate. The Five The Famous Five included Emily Murphy, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, and Irene Parlby. The five women had spent a number of years active in several women's suffragettes movements dating back to the 1880s and 1890s. As group first convened in Alberta, the five were initially referred to as The Alberta Five by the media. However, as a result of the group's importance to Canada as a whole, the group was eventually referred to as The Famous Five. =Emily Murphy= Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, as the British Empire's first female judge. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected. During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name \\"Janey Canuck\\". In 1922, she wrote The Black Candle which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. =Henrietta Muir Edwards= Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes. She was also a founding member of the Victorian Order of Nurses. =Nellie McClung= Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations. McClung famously said \\"I‚Äòve never thought minding my own business is much of a virtue. Too often it‚Äòs just an excuse for not taking action when action needs taking!\\". She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Board of the Governors. In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party. She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men. =Louise McKinney= Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Alberta and the West ‚Äì she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 ‚Äì and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the United Church of Canada, and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union. =Irene Parlby= In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She was also the first female Cabinet minister in Alberta, and still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during World War I and later served on the Board of Governors of the University of Alberta. Legacy =Honorary senators= None of the five became senators; the first female senator was Quebecer Cairine Reay Wilson, appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first \\"honorary senators\\". The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful House of Commons of Canada had elected its first female member (Agnes Macphail) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the Alberta legislature. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult. The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. =Opinions on the Famous Five= Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have eugenics legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed \\"mentally deficient\\" or \\"insane\\" in Alberta and elsewhere. Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life. Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as \\"tenacious\\" with her work with prohibition. The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights. Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the \\"evils of alcohol\\" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the Dower Act. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children. =Commemorations= Henrietta Muir Edwards; J. C.

The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the foyer and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist Barbara Paterson, one on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the other at the Olympic Plaza in Calgary. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included French and English singers, Inuit dancers, and speeches by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010. The City of Edmonton has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the \\"Famous Five\\". Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of National Council of Women of Canada, president of Canadian Women's Press Club, director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King George V to be a Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the University of Alberta with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, \\"who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women\\" should not be forgotten. Along with Th√©r√®se Casgrain, the Five were commemorated in the 2001 Journey Series of Canada's fifty-dollar bill. In December 2011, the Bank of Canada announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 Frontier Series banknote that it issued in 2012. Statues of The Famous Five in Calgary, Alberta The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.

The character was played by Hiroyuki Sanada in the 2013 film The Wolverine. Publication history The first iteration first appeared in Wolverine Vol. 1 #1 (September 1982), was created by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. The second iteration first appeared in Wolverine Vol. 4 #300 (March 2012), and created by Jason Aaron and Steven Sanders. Fictional character biography =Lord Shingen= Lord Shingen was a Japanese Yakuza crime boss who disgraced his family name, when he claimed he had a legitimate claim to the Imperial Throne of Japan, by turning his clan into a criminal empire. To settle a personal debt incurred during his rise to power, Shingen forced his daughter Mariko Yashida to marry criminal boss Noboru Hideki.Wolverine vol. 1 #1 Wolverine found out Noboru beat Mariko nearly to death and confronted Noboru but relented from killing Noboru upon Mariko's insistence, however, Shingen had Wolverine poisoned, temporarily greatly weakening Wolverine so that he could beat and humiliate the superhuman mutant in a duel with bokken in front of Mariko. Shingen used his expert knowledge of human anatomy to secretly attack Wolverine's nerve endings in such a way so as to make the duel life-threatening. But as Mariko did not know this when Wolverine attempted to use Wolverine's claws against Shingen to save Wolverine's own life, it appeared to Mariko that Wolverine was cheating in the duel. Mariko did not know that Wolverine's body had been saturated with enough lethal poison to kill several dozen ordinary men, or that Shingen was the one who was actually cheating in the duel. This had the effect of disgracing Wolverine in front of a lover, which was the design of Shingen.Wolverine vol. 1 #2 Logan was then dumped onto the Tokyo streets and found by Yukio (Shingen's best assassin) who participated in a deception with the Hand ninja clan to manipulate Wolverine into an assassination of a rival crime lord, using Mariko as unwitting bait for additional motivation. After his role was completed, Shingen ordered Logan killed, but Yukio ignored the order which led to the Hand being sent to enforce his will. In the events resulting from that action, including the death of a personal friend by Yukio, Wolverine realized that Yukio was the one who poisoned Logan at Shingen's residence and was being played for a fool at apparently Shingen's orders.Wolverine vol. 1 #3 After a philosophic epiphany about humanity, Logan then completely destroyed the Yashida criminal empire to which Wolverine confronted Shingen a second time, Shingen did not survive Wolverine's confrontation and Mariko revealed of planning to kill her dishonorable father personally and commit seppuku in recompense had not Logan preempted Mariko. Afterwards, Mariko and Wolverine decided to marry with the X-Men receiving an invitation from the Emperor of Japan for the event.Wolverine vol. 1 #4 It's later revealed that his illegitimate son Kenuichio Harada wanted to inherit Shingen's position.New Mutants #6Uncanny X-Men vol. 1 #172 Shingen was briefly resurrected by Phaedra of the Hand as part of a campaign of revenge against Wolverine.Wolverine vol. 3 #61 =Shin Harada= Shingen \\"Shin\\" Harada, otherwise known as the second Silver Samurai, is Kenuichio Harada's son and named after Lord Shingen, his grandfather.

Powers and abilities Lord Shingen had no superhuman abilities but was in peak physical condition despite his age and was one of the finest swordsmen and martial artists in all of Japan. Highly intelligent, he had extensive knowledge of human anatomy, pressure points, and also great knowledge of poisons and assassination techniques. Shingen was highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld, particularly in areas of drug traffic. Shin Harada possessed a technologically advanced suit of armor which granted him the ability of flight and protection from many conventional attacks. In addition to carrying two energy katana blades, Shin possessed a number of armaments and gadgets such as an energy cannon built into the right wrist of his suit.

Scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \\"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\\" The names Freyja and Vanir (the group of gods to which Freyja belongs) are not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess Frigg, who is mentioned as Frƒ´g in Old English and as Frƒ´ja in Old High German, all stemming from Proto-Germanic *Frijj≈ç. Although there is no similar evidence for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Freyja descends, some scholars have argued that this may simply be due to the scarcity of records outside of the North Germanic tradition. Etymology It has also been suggested that the names Freyja and Frigg may stem from a common linguistic source.Wagner, Norbert. \\"Frea Und Fulcfree: Zu Lateinisch- langobardisch ƒìÃÜ/ƒ´ÃÜ Und ≈çÃÜ/≈´ÃÜ.\\" Historische Sprachforschung / Historical Linguistics 112, no. 2 (1999): 299-304. www.jstor.org/stable/41289012. This theory, however, is rejected by most linguists in the field, who interpret the name Frigg as related to the Proto-Germanic verb *frij≈çn ('to love') and stemming from a substantivized feminine of the adjective *frijaz ('free'), whereas Freyja is regarded as descending from a feminine form of *frawj≈çn ('lord'). On the other hand, the names Freyja ('lady, mistress') and Freyr ('lord') are cognates stemming from the common root *frawj≈çn, which does not necessarily imply further relation. Common mythological traits Both Frigg and Freyja are associated with weaving, combining the aspects of a love goddess and a domestic goddess.Mythological Women: Studies in Memory of Lotte Motz, 1922-1997, Fassbaender, 2002, , p. 70; M.

Most elaborated sets may contain a Haida art gallery of more than fifty drawings. Made of maple wood, they are decorated with pyro-engravings or carvings. Many pyro-engravings are inlaid with copper or abalone shell. The drawings are complex and an artistic challenge as they are wrapped around a cylinder.

The practice is often performed in a Taoist or Buddhist temple in front of an altar. Kau Chim is often referred to as Chien Tung or Chinese Fortune Sticks by westerners. In the US, a version has been sold since 1915 under the name Chi Chi Sticks. Kau Chim is also sometimes known as \\"The Oracle of Kuan Yin\\" in Buddhist traditions. It is widely available in Thai temples, known as Siam Si (). The similar practice is also found in Japan, named O-mikuji. Tools The lottery and lottery poems in a Hong-Kong temple. * Chim bucket (): A long cylindrical bamboo cup or tube. * Kau Chim sticks (): The flat sticks which are stored in the tube. Generally made of bamboo, they resemble wide, flat incense sticks, and are often painted red at one end. A single number, both in Arabic numerals and in Chinese characters, is inscribed on each stick. Each stick has a different number on it, and no two are alike. There are usually a total of 100 sticks in the cup, although the Chi Chi Sticks variation sold in the US for fortune telling has only 78 sticks. * 100 written oracle outcomes (or 78, for the Chi Chi sticks variation). A German, Werner Banck, has classified the contents of 420 sets into 24 categories and 160 sub-categories. History The practice of kau chim interpreting dates back to the Jin dynasty, according to the Jade Box Records, an ancient Chinese book on date selection, written by the famous Taoist monk Xu Xun in the 3rd century AD. Despite the Cultural Revolution in mainland China during the 1960s and 1970s, lottery poetry still prevails today in temples of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. Most Taoism temples have lottery poetry to provide religious guidance for the believers. Practice Wong Tai Sin Temple, Hong Kong The prediction begins with the cup storing a number of the sticks. After the querent has finished their devotions to the main deity, the querent purifies the cylinder by revolving it around the incense burner three times and mixing the sticks by hand. The querent kneels in prayer, holding the cup between their palms and asking their question to the deity, either aloud or by whispering. This part needs to be done decisively as one should not shift questions or hesitate on the question in the middle of the rite. The shaking of the cylinder, which is usually tipped slightly downward, results in at least one stick leaving the cylinder and being dropped onto the floor. In most cases, if multiple sticks leave the cylinder, those fortunes do not count and must be shaken again. Each stick, with its designated number, represents one answer. When a single stick falls out, the number will correspond to one of the hundred written oracles with an answer on it. The writing on the piece of paper will provide an answer to the question. In most cases, to confirm the validity of the answer given by the deity, the querent will pick up and toss two jiaobei blocks. Each block is round on one side and flat on the other. A successful answer requires one flat and one round side to be facing up, a failed answer will result in two round sides facing up. Much emphasis is placed on denial when both sides flat are tossed; some legends say when this happens, the deities are laughing at the querent. The querent will have the option to ask for a fortune again until a successful answer can be made. Following a successful fortune, interpretation may be needed to comprehend the answer. Answers can be interpreted by a temple priest or volunteers or can be self-interpreted by the querent. In many cases, an offering is made prior to the asking of the question in order to carry good favor from the higher powers. These offerings typically consist of incense, fresh fruits, cakes, or monetary donations. Alternative tools and practice At places such as the Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur, the handheld bucket is replaced with a larger container. On the inside at the bottom of the container are protrusions (such as the heads of fixing bolts). To consult the oracle, the querent holds the sticks (Sometimes refer to as Oracle Sticks) in a vertical bundle, raises them a little inside the bucket and drops them while holding them loosely. Any stick that stands proud of the rest (because it is resting on a protrusion, not having bounced off) is considered part of the divined answer. Interpretation The stick result is analyzed by an interpreter, who has a book of Chinese poetic phrases and stories. The interpretation is generally short ranged, typically covering no more than one year, using Chinese New Year as the starting point. The interpreter typically charges a small fee. Often, interpreters provide other services such as palm or face reading. Because the supposed accuracy of the prediction very much depends on the interpreter, some people run the result through a number of different interpreters to see whether similar results are drawn. The interpreted answer is usually a historical Chinese story re-told in modern sense. The story is basically the forthcoming event the querent is about to experience. In some traditions, the believer draws one lottery and looks for the corresponding poem to the lottery. The poems are written or printed on a piece of paper, usually long and wide, with a Jueju poem on each piece as the answer to the believer from the gods. Locale In Hong Kong, by and large the most popular place for this fortune telling practice is the Wong Tai Sin Temple which draws thousands to millions of people each year. In 1915, kau chim sticks were introduced to the United States under the trade name \\"Chi Chi Chinese Fortune Teller\\" by the Pacific Dry Goods Company of San Francisco, California, where a large population of Chinese immigrants had settled. The Chi Chi sticks, 78 in number, were made in China of bamboo but they were marked with Arabic numerals instead of Chinese characters, and were packaged in a bright yellow and red chipboard tube with a black lid (like a modern mailing tube). They were accompanied by a rolled-up booklet of 78 rhyming interpretations that fit inside the tube with the sticks. By the early 1920s, Chi Chi sticks were available all across America, from several importers and under a variety of trade names, including \\"Chien Tung Fortune Teller.\\" They were heavily marketed to African American fortune tellers through mail-order catalogs. They fell out of popularity during World War II, but only due to problems with supply, as China had been invaded by Japan and trade routes were disrupted. In the 1990s, importations of kau chim sticks were available again in the US. This time, packaged in leather-covered tubes painted with ornate Chinese designs, but also with the old rhyming Chi Chi stick booklet so well known to some Americans. Meanwhile, vintage Chi Chi sticks of the 1915-1935 era (if all their parts and the booklet are intact) have become highly desired artifacts among those who collect fortune telling objects. The practice of using sticks in Chien Tung may be related to the game of pick-up sticks played today. This theory is based on a Japanese variation, called Mikado, which also has an emperor stick. A form of the game developed in the 16th century and may have been adapted from Chinese culture and religion. Some Taoist temples in Malaysia also revere a special Medicinal Oracle sticks which the poems are written in the form of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) concoction. You can use the poem to buy TCM formula from the nearby TCM shop.

It serves as a sequel to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, also directed and co- written by Hooper. It was written by L. M. Kit Carson and produced by Carson, Yoram Globus, Menahem Golan and Hooper. Starring Dennis Hopper, Caroline Williams, Bill Johnson, Bill Moseley and Jim Siedow, the plot follows a radio host victimized and captured by Leatherface and his cannibalistic family while a former Texas Marshall hunts them down. During its theatrical release, the film grossed $8 million domestically against its $4.5 million budget and became popular on home video. The sequel received a mixed reception from critics and audiences alike. Positives and negatives referred to its emphasis on black comedy and gore, which departed from the first film's utilized minimal gore, low-budget v√©rit√© style and atmosphere to build tension and fear. Director Tobe Hooper decided to focus on its black comedy as he believed this was present in the first film, but was unacknowledged by viewers because of its gritty content. Despite the mixed reception, the film eventually gained a cult following. It was followed by Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III.  Plot  Two high school seniors, Buzz and Rick, race along a desolate stretch of Texas highway, en route to the Texas-OU football game at the Dallas Cotton Bowl.

The following morning, Lieutenant Boude \\"Lefty\\" Enright, former Texas Ranger, and uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who were victims of Leatherface and his family years earlier, arrives at the scene of the crime to help solve Buzz and Rick's murders. Lefty has spent the last thirteen years looking into his nephew's disappearance, investigating reports of mysterious chainsaw killings across Texas. He is contacted by Stretch, who brings him a copy of the audio tape that recorded the attack. He sends her away, leaving Stretch and JB to reluctantly get radio coverage of a Texas/Oklahoma Chili Cookoff. The winner happens to be Drayton Sawyer (current patriarch of the cannibalistic Sawyer family), who declares that his secret is having an eye for \\"prime meat.\\" Meanwhile, Lefty shops for an arsenal of chainsaws at a local hardware store. He at first unnerves, then amuses the shop's owner with his brutal testing of the saws on a log. Lefty then drives to Stretch's radio station and asks her to play the tape on her nightly radio show so that the public, which had previously mocked his case, will have to listen to him. Drayton, driving home from his chili cookoff victory, demands that his family go to the radio station, prompted by the nightly radio broadcast of the tape. While preparing to leave for the night, Stretch is confronted by Bobby \\"Chop Top\\" Sawyer before being attacked by Leatherface. Her coworker L.G. Peters is apparently killed by Chop Top. Leatherface corners Stretch and is about to kill her, but she charms him into sparing her. Leatherface returns to Chop Top and leads him to believe that he has killed Stretch. They then take L.G. to their home, followed by Stretch, who becomes trapped inside the Sawyer home, an abandoned carnival ground decorated with human bones, multi-colored lights, and carnival remnants. Lefty, who has been following their car all along, arrives equipped with chainsaws and trashes the home before he finds Franklin's remains. Meanwhile, Stretch is found by Leatherface, who puts L.G.'s skinned face and hat on her before tying her arms and leaving. Later, L.G. is still alive and frees Stretch before dying. Drayton finds Stretch and the family capture her. Chop Top scolds Leatherface when he finds out that Stretch is still alive. They torture her at the dinner table, but Lefty arrives and saves her. Stretch flees the ground, but Chop Top chases her. Lefty wounds Drayton. Lefty and Leatherface get into a chainsaw fight, and Leatherface is fatally wounded. The dying Drayton, accepting that he and his family have lost, takes a grenade from Nubbins' corpse and blows up the ground, killing himself, Lefty, Leatherface and Grandpa. Chop Top chases Stretch to the top of a rock tower. Stretch grabs a chainsaw held by the corpse of the family's grandmother in a shrine and fatally wounds Chop Top, causing him to fall off the tower to his death. Stretch shouts in triumph and swings the chainsaw in the air. Cast * Caroline Williams as Vanita \\"Stretch\\" Brock * Dennis Hopper as Lt.

According to the documentary Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films, the production company Cannon Films were expecting a horror film while Tobe Hooper wanted to make a black comedy. When Cannon viewed the film they were unhappy with the final product. The movie's climax was filmed at the closed Matterhorn amusement park in Prairie Dell, Texas. They shot in caves for the scenes inside the Sawyer home. Gunnar Hansen was initially approached to reprise his role as Leatherface but he claimed to have been offered \\"scale, plus ten percent\\" with the ten percent going to his agent. When he replied that he had no agent, they offered scale without the additional ten percent. Hansen found the offer too low. Unit publicist Scott Holton offered an alternate story claiming Hansen vacillated about the part and the offer was rescinded. Holton didn't believe the average viewer was even aware of who the original actors were, claiming \\"who are Neal, Hansen or Burns?\\" Bill Moseley created a short film parody entitled The Texas Chainsaw Manicure where he played a small role as The Hitchiker and showed it to a screenwriter who was able to show it to Tobe Hooper. Hooper loved it and kept Moseley in mind for a part should he ever make a sequel. When the time came to cast Chainsaw 2, Moseley was contacted for the role of Chop Top, the Hitchhiker's twin brother. = Deleted scenes = Several scenes were deleted by director Tobe Hooper due to pacing issues as mentioned on the 2000 Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Shocking Truth documentary. One lengthy scene that was cut from the film involves the Sawyer Clan heading out at night to collect prime meat for their chili by slaughtering movie patrons and a group of rowdy, rioting fans. The deleted slaughtering scene featured several elaborate Tom Savini special effects. Another deleted scene also includes the American film critic Joe Bob Briggs. An alternative plot line involving Lefty Enright as Stretch's father was also scrapped. However, these scenes are present on the 2007 Gruesome Edition DVD special features section. Release The film was released theatrically in the United States by Cannon Films in August 1986. It grossed $8,025,872 at the domestic box office. After it was submitted to the MPAA in the United States, the film received an \\"X\\" rating, prompting the filmmakers to release it as unrated. However, TV previews, theatrical trailers and even posters for the film displayed the written statement: \\"Due to the nature of this film, no-one under 17 will be admitted\\". Reception Critical reception to the film was mixed. Roger Ebert awarded the film one star out of four, lambasting the film because it \\"goes flat-out from one end to the other, never spending any time on pacing, on timing, on the anticipation of horror. It doesn't even pause to establish the characters; Dennis Hopper has the most thankless task, playing a man who spends the first half of the movie looking distracted and vague, and the second half screaming during chainsaw duels.\\" He also commented that it \\"has a lot of blood and disembowelment, to be sure, but it doesn't have the terror of the original, the desire to be taken seriously. It's a geek show.\\" TV Guides review was similarly negative, stating that \\"the film feels as if Hooper himself has nothing but contempt for the original and went out of his way to tear it down.\\" AllMovie's review was favorable, writing, \\"much-hated at the time of its release, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 has aged remarkably well, now playing as a strangely effective if none-too-subtle satire of several facets of '80s excess.\\" The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2 holds a 47% approval rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 4.76/10. Its consensus reads, \\"Without the tense atmosphere of its predecessor, the stakes feel lower, but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 still shocks with a gonzo blend of over-the-top humor and gore.\\" On Metacritic the film holds a score of 42 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". It has since become a cult film. = Controversy = The film was released on VHS by Media Home Entertainment the same year. When initially released on home video and LaserDisc, it still had no rating. When reissued on home video and on DVD in 2000 by MGM Home Entertainment, it was given an \\"R\\" rating by the MPAA. In a similar way to its predecessor, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 has had a checkered past in regard to its relationship with censors in various countries. As a result, the film was banned in Germany and Singapore, however the Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft in Germany later gave the uncut version an 18 rating, and Singapore gave it an R21 (Resticted to under 21) rating after an appeal. When the film was submitted in the United Kingdom to the BBFC for a certificate, the BBFC notified Cannon, the distributor, that at least 20 to 25 minutes of footage would have to be trimmed in order for the film to be given an 18 rating. Cannon attempted to cut the film, but eventually gave up after numerous re-edited versions failed to pass the BBFC. The uncut version of the film was eventually given an 18 rating in 2001. The film was banned in Australia for 20 years. An uncut version was released on VHS by Warner Home Video in New Zealand in 1987, but could also be found (illegally, as the box proudly stated) in some Australian video stores at the time. The New Zealand VHS cassette has become very rare. In 2000, an unofficial VHS release was issued to retailers throughout Australia. This was done so illegally by a duplicating house, and without the knowledge of the OFLC. When news of the illegal copies leaked, a number of retailers were raided for possessing infringing copies. The duplicating house was similarly raided by Federal Customs. The film was finally passed for official release in Australia on November 30, 2006. The Uncut \\"Gruesome Edition\\" DVD was released on January 24 the next year. = Soundtrack = # The Lords of the New Church: \\"Good to Be Bad\\" ‚Äì 4:42 # The Cramps: \\"Goo Goo Muck\\" ‚Äì 3:02 # Concrete Blonde: \\"Haunted Head\\" ‚Äì 2:48 # Timbuk3: \\"Life Is Hard\\" ‚Äì 4:06 # Torch Song: \\"White Night\\" ‚Äì 3:42 # Stewart Copeland: \\"Strange Things Happen\\" ‚Äì 2:58 # Concrete Blonde: \\"Over Your Shoulder\\" ‚Äì 3:20 # Timbuk3: \\"Shame on You\\" ‚Äì 4:48 # The Lords of the New Church: \\"Mind Warp\\" ‚Äì 3:42 # Oingo Boingo: \\"No One Lives Forever\\" ‚Äì 4:08 \\"Crazy Crazy Mama\\" by Roky Erickson was used in the film but not included on the soundtrack album. = Home media = In August 2000, the film was released on a region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment. In October 2006, the film received a second DVD treatment from MGM, entitled \\"The Gruesome Edition\\", which featured an audio commentary by director Tobe Hooper and David Gregory, director of Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Shocking Truth, as well as an audio commentary by actors Bill Moseley, Caroline Williams and special effects makeup creator Tom Savini. The special features also included deleted scenes, a feature-length documentary entitled It Runs in the Family, six still galleries and a trailer. A Blu-ray edition of the film was released in September 2012 which featured all of the special features from the \\"Gruesome Edition\\" DVD. Scream Factory released a Collectors Edition of the film on Blu- ray on April 19, 2016. Sequel The official sequel to the film was Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III but in 1998, Tobe Hooper's son William Hooper, began work on All American Massacre, a short film that would be both a sequel and a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. Hooper ran out of funds for post-production in 2000 and the film was never completed and released although the trailer leaked online in the early 2000s.

He initially served in the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War, where he became known as one of \\"the Zeppelin killers from Canada\\", after shooting down two airships. During the inter-war period he served as a Royal Air Force squadron and station commander, eventually becoming the RAF's Director of Training in 1935, and was Air Officer Commanding RAF Mediterranean from 1938 until after the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940 he returned to Canada where he was primarily responsible for the Commonwealth Air Training Plan, transferring to the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1942. Early life and background Leckie was born in Glasgow, Scotland, where his father and grandfather were weavers. In 1909 his family emigrated to Canada, where he worked for his uncle John Leckie while living in West Toronto. First World War Leckie was initially commissioned into the 1st Central Ontario Regiment, and in late 1915 paid C$600 to begin flying training at the Curtiss Flying School on Toronto Island. However, he had completed only three hours of training in the Curtiss Model F flying boat at Hanlan's Point, when the school was forced to close for the winter. At the urging of Sir Charles Kingsmill, the Chief of the Canadian Naval staff, the Royal Navy agreed to accept half of the class, and Leckie was sent to England. On 6 December 1915, he was commissioned as a probationary temporary flight sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Air Service, and posted to Royal Navy Air Station Chingford, for training. On 10 May 1916, having accumulated 33 hours and 3 minutes flying time, he was granted Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 2923, and was then sent to RNAS Felixstowe for further training in flying boats. He was confirmed in his rank of flight sub- lieutenant in June, and in August was posted to RNAS Great Yarmouth to fly patrols over the North Sea. Curtiss H-12 'Large America' in RNAS service, c.1917. Leckie's first success came on 14 May 1917, as pilot of Curtiss Model H-12 'Large America' No. 8666, under the command of Flight Lieutenant Christopher John Galpin. The aircraft left Great Yarmouth on patrol at 03.30 a.m. in poor weather with heavy rain and low cloud. The weather cleared as she approached the Texel, and at 4:45 a.m. she spotted the Terschelling Light Vessel, and a few minutes later Zeppelin L 22 about 10‚Äì15 miles away. The Curtiss increased speed and gained height, and Leckie took over the controls as Galpin manned the twin Lewis guns mounted in the bow. The Curtiss managed to approach to within half a mile before she was spotted, and the Zeppelin attempted to evade, but by then it was too late. The aircraft dived down alongside and Galpin fired an entire drum of incendiary bullets at a range of about 50 yards. The L 22 rapidly caught fire, and crashed into the sea. The Curtiss returned to Great Yarmouth by 7:50 a.m., and they found only two bullet holes, in the left upper wing and the hull amidships, where the Germans had returned fire. On 22 June, for his part in downing the L 22, Leckie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, while Galpin received the Distinguished Service Order. On 30 June Leckie was promoted to flight lieutenant. Another memorable patrol began for Leckie at 10.35 a.m. on 5 September 1917, again flying Curtiss H-12 No. 8666 from Great Yarmouth, under Squadron Commander Vincent Nicholl. They were accompanied by a de Havilland DH.4 biplane, and were again heading for Terschelling. However, they were only part-way to their destination when they unexpectedly encountered the Zeppelins L 44 and L 46 accompanied by support ships. The British aircraft were hit by enemy fire, but pressed their attack on the L 44. Nicholl noted several hits on the Zeppelin from his guns, but it did not catch fire. Leckie then turned the aircraft to attack the L 46, but it had turned rapidly away and was out of range, as was the L 44 by the time he turned back. Both British aircraft had been hit, and the DH.4's engine soon failed. The Curtiss had also been hit in one engine and one wing was badly damaged. The DH.4 was forced to ditch into the sea, and Nicholl ordered Leckie to put the aircraft down to rescue the two crew. However, now with six men aboard, damaged, and in heavy seas Leckie was unable to take off again. Some 75 miles from the English coast, the aircraft began to taxi towards home. Their radio was waterlogged, but they did have four homing pigeons. Nicholl attached messages to the birds giving their position and course and sent them off at intervals. After four hours the aircraft ran out of fuel, and began to drift, so they improvised a sea anchor from empty fuel cans to steady it. That night the damaged wing tip broke off, and each man then had to spend two hours at a time outside balanced on the opposite wing to keep the broken wing from filling with water and dragging the aircraft under. After three days at sea, the six men were suffering badly. They had no food and only two gallons of drinking water, gained from draining the radiators of their water-cooled engines. Finally, at dawn on 8 September, as search operations were about to be called off, one of the pigeons was found, dead from exhaustion, by the coastguard station at Walcot, and shortly after midday they were rescued by the torpedo gunboat . Pigeon No. N.U.R.P./17/F.16331 was preserved, and originally kept in the officers' mess at RNAS Yarmouth, but is now on display at the RAF Museum Hendon. A brass plate on the display case bears the inscription \\"A very gallant gentleman\\". On 31 December 1917 Leckie was appointed a flight commander. While on patrol on 20 February 1918, Leckie spotted an enemy submarine on the surface, and attacked it with bombs, seeing one strike the vessel as it dived, leaving a large oil slick. Leckie was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 17 May 1918, only learning much later that he had not actually sunk it. Felixstowe F.2A (N4283) in black and white \\"dazzle\\" scheme, flown by Captains Robert Leckie and Gerald Livock in March 1918. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and Leckie transferred to the new service with the rank of lieutenant (temporary captain), though on 8 April he was promoted to the temporary rank of major. On 4 June 1918 Leckie led an offensive patrol of four Felixstowe F.2A flying boats and a Curtiss H.12 towards the Haaks Light Vessel off the Dutch coast. They saw no enemy aircraft until one of the F.2A's, number N.4533, was forced down with a broken fuel feed-pipe. Five enemy seaplanes appeared, but seemed more interested in attacking the crippled F.2A. The remaining aircraft circled N.4533 as it taxied towards to the Dutch coast (where the crew eventually burned their aircraft before being interned), until ten more German seaplanes appeared. Leckie promptly led his small force into a head on attack, and a dogfight ensued which lasted for 40 minutes. Despite further mechanical difficulties ‚Äì two other F2A's also had problems with their fuel pipes and had to effect makeshift repairs while in the middle of the action ‚Äì two German aircraft were shot down, and four badly damaged before the Germans broke off the action, for the loss of one F.2A and the Curtiss (its crew survived to be interned by the Dutch), and one man killed. Leckie's force returned to Great Yarmouth, and in his report he bitterly remarked \\"...these operations were robbed of complete success entirely through faulty petrol pipes... It is obvious that our greatest foes are not the enemy...\\" On the afternoon of 5 August 1918 a squadron of five Zeppelins took off from Friedrichshafen. They headed for the east coast of England, timing their flight to arrive off the coast just after dark. The leading airship, L 70 was commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Johann von Lossnitzer, but also had Fregattenkapit√§n Peter Strasser, the F√ºhrer der Luftschiffe (\\"Leader of Airships\\"), the commander of the Imperial German Navy's airship force, on board. However, the airship squadron was spotted while out at sea by the Lenman Tail lightship which signalled their course and position to the Admiralty. Responding to the report Major Egbert Cadbury jumped into the pilot's seat of the only aircraft available, a DH.4, while Leckie occupied the observer/gunner's position. After about an hour they spotted the L 70 and attacked, with Leckie firing eighty rounds of incendiary bullets into her. Fire rapidly consumed the airship as it plummeted into the sea. Cadbury and Leckie, and another pilot Lieutenant Ralph Edmund Keys, then attacked and damaged another Zeppelin, which promptly turned tail and headed for home. All three received the Distinguished Flying Cross. A few days later, on 11 August 1918 Leckie took part in another operation over the North Sea. Zeppelins often shadowed British naval ships, while carefully operating at higher altitudes than anti-aircraft guns or flying boats could achieve, and out of range of land based aircraft, so the Harwich Light Cruiser Force set out with a Sopwith Camel lashed to a decked lighter towed by the destroyer HMS Redoubt. When Leckie's reconnaissance flight reported an approaching Zeppelin, the Redoubt steamed at full speed into the wind, allowing the Camel's pilot Lieutenant Culley to take off with only a five-yard run. Culley climbed to 18,800 feet, approached the L 53 out of the sun, and attacked with his twin Lewis guns, setting the airship on fire. On 20 August 1918 Leckie was appointed commander of the newly formed No. 228 Squadron, flying the Curtis H-12 and Felixstowe F.2A out of Great Yarmouth. Within three months the armistice brought the fighting to an end. Inter-war career Leckie remained with the RAF until 31 March 1919 when he was transferred to the unemployed list, and simultaneously seconded to the Canadian Air Force with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel, to command the 1st Wing, Canadian Air Force. This unit comprised No. 81 Squadron (No. 1 Canadian), flying S.E.5 and Sopwith Dolphin fighters, and No. 123 Squadron (No. 2 Canadian), flying Airco DH.9A bombers, and was based at RAF Shoreham, Sussex. The Canadian Wing had been formed in August 1918 at RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, but never saw active service, and was eventually disbanded when the Canadian Expeditionary Force returned home. On 1 August 1919 Leckie was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force with the rank of major (later squadron leader), relinquishing his commission in the 1st Central Ontario Regiment of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada on the 31st. On 15 December 1919 he was seconded for duty with the Canadian Air Board serving as Superintendent of Flying Operations. In this role he played a central role in the development of Canadian civil aviation, organizing and taking part in the first trans-Canada flight between Halifax and Vancouver. Leckie and Major Basil Hobbs flew from Halifax to Winnipeg between 7 and 10 October 1920, before other pilots and aircraft took over, finally arriving in Vancouver on the 17th. Leckie's secondment ended on 27 May 1922, and he returned to Britain to be posted to the No. 1 School of Technical Training at RAF Halton on 8 June. On 25 September he was posted the RAF Depot (Inland Area) as a supernumerary officer, in order to attend the Royal Navy Staff College. On 5 July 1923 he was posted to the Headquarters of RAF Coastal Area. On 1 January 1926 Leckie was promoted to wing commander, and on 16 March was posted to Headquarters, Mediterranean, where on 30 March he joined the aircraft carrier to serve as Senior Air Force Officer. He returned to the depot at RAF Uxbridge on 11 May 1927, and on 26 August was posted to Headquarters, Coastal Area, while he waited for to be commissioned. Following the completion of her conversion to an aircraft carrier Courageous was commissioned at Devonport on 14 February 1928, and on 21 February Leckie joined her as Senior Air Force Officer. Leckie returned to dry land on 5 September 1929, when he was appointed commander of RAF Bircham Newton, Norfolk. On 11 April 1931 he became commander of No. 210 Squadron RAF, initially based at Felixstowe, and then RAF Pembroke Dock, flying the Supermarine Southampton Mk. II. On 1 January 1933 Leckie was promoted to group captain, and on 30 January he was appointed both Superintendent of the RAF Reserve and commander of RAF Hendon. On 21 August 1935 Leckie was also appointed an additional Air Aide-de-Camp to King George V, attending the King's funeral in that capacity on 28 January 1936, and was appointed Air Aide-de-Camp to King Edward VIII on 1 July 1936. Leckie was appointed Director of Training at the Air Ministry on 5 October 1936, taking over from Air Commodore Arthur Tedder, and was promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1937, handing over the post as Air Aide-de-Camp to the King to Group Captain Keith Park the same day. Leckie's tenure as Director of Training ended on 28 November 1938, and on 2 December 1938 he was appointed Air Officer Commanding, RAF Mediterranean, based at Malta. Second World War In 1940, Leckie was seconded to the Royal Canadian Air Force to establish the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) in Canada. By the end of the war BCATP had trained 131,553 air crew from 11 countries. On 5 August 1941 he was promoted to the acting rank of air vice-marshal, and served as Member of the Air Council for Training. On 6 April 1942 Leckie was placed on the RAF retired list on accepting a commission in the Royal Canadian Air Force. On 2 June 1943 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). From 1 January 1944 until 31 August 1947 Leckie served as Chief of Staff, RCAF with the rank of air marshal. For his service during the Second World War Leckie received the Order of Polonia Restituta (1st class) from the President of the Republic of Poland on 1 May 1945, and was also made a Commander of the Legion of Merit by the United States, and a Grand Officer of both the Belgian Order of the Crown and the Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion. In July 1948 he was awarded the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross by the King of Norway \\"in recognition of distinguished services rendered in the cause of the Allies\\". Post-war career Leckie retired from the Royal Canadian Air Force on 1 September 1947, though he continued to take an interest in aviation, serving as a special consultant to the Air Cadet League. Air Marshal Leckie died on 31 March 1975, the last surviving wartime Chief of the Air Staff, aged 84. He was survived by his widow, Bernice, and two sons. Leckie was inducted into the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988.

They were widely used as textbooks in American schools from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, and are still used today in some private schools and in homeschooling. It is estimated that at least 120 million copies of McGuffey's Readers were sold between 1836 and 1960, placing its sales in a category with the Bible and Webster's Dictionary. Since 1961, they have continued to sell at a rate of some 30,000 copies a year. Only the Ray's Arithmetic series (1834-1913) matched it in popularity, written by a colleague of McGuffey's and begun in 1834. McGuffey The editor of the Readers was William Holmes McGuffey. He was born September 23, 1800, near Claysville, Pennsylvania, and moved to Coitsville Township, Ohio, with his parents in 1802. McGuffey's family had emigrated to America from Scotland in 1774, and they had strong opinions on religion and a belief in education. Consequently, education and preaching the Gospel were McGuffey's passions. He had a remarkable ability to memorize and could commit to memory entire books of the Bible. McGuffey became a \\"roving\\" teacher at the age of 14, beginning with 48 students in a one-room school in Calcutta, Ohio, and at a seminary in the town of Poland, Ohio. The size of the class was just one of several challenges which the young McGuffey faced. In many one-teacher schools, students' ages varied from six to 21. McGuffey often worked 11 hours a day, six days a week, in a succession of frontier schools, primarily in the state of Kentucky. Students brought their own books, most frequently the Bible, since few textbooks existed. Between teaching jobs, McGuffey received a classical education at the Greersburg Academy (also called The Old Stone Academy) in Darlington, Pennsylvania. He went on to study at Washington College (now Washington & Jefferson College) where he graduated in 1826. That same year, he was appointed to a position as Professor of Languages at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. McGuffey became famous as the author of the Readers (more accurately the editor), but he wrote few other works. He left Miami University for positions of successively greater responsibility at Cincinnati College, Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, and Woodward College in Cincinnati, where he served as president. He ended his career as a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Virginia. Publication McGuffey established a reputation as a lecturer on moral and biblical subjects while he was teaching at Miami University. In 1835, the small Cincinnati publishing firm of Truman and Smith asked him to create a series of four graded readers for primary level students. He had been recommended for the job by longtime friend Harriet Beecher Stowe. He completed the first two readers within a year of signing his contract, receiving a fee of $1,000 ($ in dollars). He compiled the first four readers (1836-1837 edition), while the fifth and sixth were created by his brother Alexander during the 1840s. The series consisted of stories, poems, essays, and speeches. The advanced Readers contained excerpts from the works of well-regarded English and American writers and politicians such as Lord Byron, John Milton, and Daniel Webster. Most schools of the 19th century used only the first two in the series of McGuffey's four readers. The first Reader taught reading by using the phonics method, the identification of letters and their arrangement into words, and aided with slate work. The second Reader was used once students could read. It helped them to understand the meaning of sentences, while providing vivid stories which children could remember. The third Reader taught the definitions of words and was written at a level equivalent to the modern 5th or 6th grade. The fourth Reader was written for the highest levels of ability on the grammar school level. McGuffey's Readers were among the first textbooks in the United States designed to be increasingly challenging with each volume. They used word repetition in the text as a learning tool, developing reading skills by challenging students using the books. Sounding-out, enunciation, and accents were emphasized. Colonial-era texts had offered dull lists of 20 to 100 new words per page for memorization. In contrast, McGuffey used new vocabulary words in the context of real literature, gradually introducing new words and carefully repeating the old. McGuffey believed that teachers, as well as their students, should study the lessons and suggested that they read aloud to their classes. He also listed questions after each story, for he believed that asking questions was critical for a teacher to give instruction. The Readers emphasized spelling, vocabulary, and formal public speaking, which was a more common requirement in 19th-century America than today. McGuffey is remembered as a conservative theological teacher. He interpreted the goals of public schooling in terms of moral and spiritual education, and attempted to give schools a curriculum that would instill Presbyterian Calvinist beliefs and manners in their students. These goals were considered suitable for the relatively homogeneous America of the early- to mid-19th century, though they were less so for the increasingly pluralistic society that developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The content of the readers changed drastically between McGuffey's 1836-1837 edition and the 1879 edition. The revised Readers were compiled to meet the needs of national unity and the dream of an American melting pot for the world's oppressed masses. The Calvinist values of salvation, righteousness, and piety were excluded from the later versions, though they had been prominent in the early Readers. The content of the books was secularized and replaced by middle-class civil religion, morality, and values. McGuffey's name was featured on these revised editions, yet he neither contributed to them nor approved their content. Other types of schoolbooks gradually replaced McGuffey's in the academic marketplace. The desire for distinct grade levels and less overtly religious content, and the greater profitability of consumable workbooks all helped to bring about their decline. McGuffey's Readers never entirely disappeared, however. Reprinted versions of his Readers are still in print, and may be purchased in bookstores across the country. Today, McGuffey's Readers are popular among homeschoolers and in some Protestant religious schools.  Influence  Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ron Powers notes that the Readers affected the first mass-educated and mass-literate generation in the modern world. Henry Ford's childhood set of McGuffey's Readers The manufacturer Henry Ford cited McGuffey's Readers as one of his most important childhood influences. He was an avid fan of McGuffey's Readers first editions, and claimed as an adult to be able to quote from McGuffey's by memory at great length. Ford republished all six Readers from the 1867 edition and distributed complete sets of them, at his own expense, to schools across the United States. In 1934, Ford had the log cabin where McGuffey was born moved to Greenfield Village, Ford's museum of Americana at Dearborn, Michigan. In 1936, Ford was an associate editor (along with Hamlin Garland, John W. Studebaker and William F. Wiley) of a collection of excerpts from McGuffey Readers. This 482-page compendium was dedicated to Ford, \\"lifelong devotee of his boyhood Alma Mater, the McGuffey Readers\\". American composer Burrill Phillips composed a work entitled Selections from McGuffey's Reader, for orchestra, based on poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. It was completed in 1933.

It acknowledges that those involved in producing, selling, using and disposing of products have a shared responsibility to ensure that those products or materials are managed in a way that reduces their impact, throughout their lifecycle, on the environment and on human health and safety.Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Energy, Product Stewardship, accessed 29 September 2019 This approach focusses on the product itself, and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental, health, and safety impacts.United States Environment Protection Agency, The United States Environment Protection Agency For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials.The National Chemical Emergency Centre For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product. Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process. It is considered a pre- requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) \\"commodity\\" and \\"product\\" relationships. The most familiar example is the container-deposit legislation. A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains. If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling. If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for landfill or litter control measures. Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving: this is quite common, for instance, among homeless people in U.S. cities. However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires. When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become. In some countries, such as Germany, law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way. This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally. In the United States, the issue has been confronted via class action lawsuits that attempt to hold companies liable for the environmental impact of their products. Thus far, such as litigation or proposed accounting reforms such as full cost accounting have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of academe and corporate public relations (derisively referred to as greenwashing). The demand-side approach ethical consumerism, supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship. Legislation Australia's Product Stewardship Act 2011 provides a framework for managing the environmental, health and safety impacts of products, and in particular those impacts associated with the disposal of products and their associated waste. The framework includes voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship. The passage of the legislation is said to have delivered on a key commitment by the Australian Government under the National Waste Policy, which was agreed by Australian state governments in November 2009 and endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in October 2010.Australian Government, What is the Product Stewardship Act 2011, accessed 29 September 2019 The Act supports the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) through the Product Stewardship (Televisions and Computers) Regulations 2011. The scheme has recycled approximately 230,000 tonnes of electronic waste since its inception. This review is an important opportunity to continue to update and improve the NTCRS. The Minister‚Äôs Product List is established by the Act, and is updated annually. The list informs the community and industry of those products being considered for accreditation or regulation under the Act. A review of the Act was mandated to take place five years after implementation, and this was initiated in March 2018.Australian Government, Review of the Product Stewardship Act 2011, including the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme Consultation paper, published March 2018, accessed 29 September 2019 Extended producer responsibility Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with extended producer responsibility, a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used. While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product - not only manufacturers, but also retailers, consumers and recyclers.Waste to Wealth This includes See also *Extended producer responsibility *Recycling *Sustainability References External links *Product Stewardship Society *Product Policy Institute *The Product Stewardship Institute *Northwest Product Stewardship Council *Container Recycling Institute *Global Product Stewardship Council Category:Corporate social responsibility Category:Waste management concepts Category:Waste minimisation Category:Products and the environment ","title":"Product stewardship"},{"id":"397810","text":"Lee Alexander McQueen, CBE (17 March 1969 ‚Äì 11 February 2010) was a British fashion designer and couturier. He worked as chief designer at Givenchy from 1996 to 2001, and founded his own Alexander McQueen label in 1992. His achievements in fashion earned him four British Designer of the Year awards (1996, 1997, 2001 and 2003), as well as the CFDA's International Designer of the Year award in 2003. McQueen died by suicide in 2010, at the age of 40, at his home in Mayfair, London. Early life Born on 17 March 1969 in Lewisham, London, to Scottish taxi driver Ronald and social science teacher Joyce, McQueen was the youngest of six children. It was reported that he grew up in a council flat, but, in fact, the McQueens moved to a terraced house in Stratford in his first year. McQueen then attended Rokeby School and left aged 16 in 1985 with one O-level in art, going on to complete a course in tailoring at Newham College and serve an apprenticeship with Savile Row tailors Anderson & Sheppard, before joining Gieves & Hawkes and, later, the theatrical costumiers Angels and Bermans. The skills he learned as an apprentice on Savile Row helped earn him a reputation in the fashion world as an expert in creating an impeccably tailored look. While serving his apprenticeship, McQueen attended the Rosetta Art Centre led by Yvonne Humble, who also wrote his reference that saw him go straight on to the MA fashion course at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Because of the strength of his portfolio, Bobby Hillson, the Head of the Masters course at St Martins, encouraged McQueen to enroll as a student. He received his master's degree in fashion design and his 1992 graduation collection was bought in its entirety by influential fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who was said to have persuaded McQueen to become known as Alexander (his middle name) when he subsequently launched his fashion career. Isabella Blow paved the way for Alexander McQueen using her unique style and contacts to help him. She was in many ways his mentor. It was during this period that McQueen relocated to Hoxton, which housed other new designers, including Hussein Chalayan and Pauric Sweeney. It was shortly after creating his second collection,\\"McQueen's Theatre of Cruelty\\", that McQueen met Katy England, his soon to be \\"right hand woman\\", when outside of a \\"high profile fashion show\\" trying to \\"blag her way in\\". He promptly asked her to join him for his third collection, \\"The Birds\\" at Kings Cross, as \\"creative director\\". Katy England continued to work with McQueen thereafter, greatly influencing his work ‚Äì his \\"second opinion\\". McQueen designed the wardrobe for David Bowie's tours in 1996‚Äì1997, as well as the Union Jack coat worn by Bowie on the cover of his 1997 album Earthling. Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk sought McQueen's work for the cover of her album Homogenic in 1997. McQueen also directed the music video for her song \\"Alarm Call\\" from the same album and later contributed the iconic topless dress to her video for \\"Pagan Poetry\\".Alien Rock. \\"The Light of Love: The Making of the Pagan Poetry Video \\". Bjork.com. 2002. McQueen also collaborated with dancer Sylvie Guillem, director Robert Lepage and choreographer Russell Maliphant, designing wardrobe for theater show \\"Eonnagata\\", directed by Robert Lepage. The film Sylvie Guillem, on the edge produced by French production company A DROITE DE LA LUNE, traces whole history of the creation of the show, from first rehearsals which took place in Quebec until world premiere which was held in 2008 at Sadler's Wells theatre in London.

Retrieved 12 February 2010. McQueen's early runway collections developed his reputation for controversy and shock tactics (earning the title \\"l'enfant terrible\\" and \\"the hooligan of English fashion\\"), with trousers aptly named \\"bumsters\\" and a collection titled \\"Highland Rape\\". In 2004, journalist Caroline Evans also wrote of McQueen's \\"theatrical staging of cruelty\\", in 032c magazine, referring to his dark and tortured renderings of Scottish history. Evans, Caroline, \\"Fashion: Alexander McQueen\\", 032c issue 7 (Summer, 2004). McQueen was known for his lavish, unconventional runway shows: a recreation of a shipwreck for his spring 2003 collection; spring 2005's human chess game; and his autumn 2006 show \\"Widows of Culloden\\", which featured a life-sized hologram of supermodel Kate Moss dressed in yards of rippling fabric. McQueen's \\"bumsters\\" spawned a trend in low-rise jeans; on their debut they attracted many comments and debate. Michael Oliveira-Salac, the director of Blow PR and a friend of McQueen's said, \\"The bumster for me is what defined McQueen.\\" McQueen also became known for using skulls in his designs. A scarf bearing the motif became a celebrity must-have and was copied around the world. McQueen has been credited with bringing drama and extravagance to the catwalk. He used new technology and innovation to add a different twist to his shows and often shocked and surprised audiences. The silhouettes that he created have been credited for adding a sense of fantasy and rebellion to fashion. McQueen became one of the first designers to use Indian models in London. Alexander McQueen for Givenchy Fall 1998 'Blade Runner' suit. Adnan Ege Kutay Collection =Givenchy appointment= Upon arrival at Givenchy, McQueen insulted the founder by calling him \\"irrelevant\\". His first couture collection with Givenchy was unsuccessful, with even McQueen telling Vogue in October 1997 that the collection was \\"crap\\". McQueen toned down his designs at Givenchy, but continued to indulge his rebellious streak, causing controversy in autumn 1998 with a show which included double amputee model Aimee Mullins striding down the catwalk on intricately carved wooden legs. This year also saw McQueen complete one of his most famous runway shows previewing Spring/Summer 1999, where a single model, Shalom Harlow, graced the runway in a strapless white dress, before being rotated slowly on a revolving section of the catwalk whilst being sprayed with paint by two robotic guns.London Fashion Review ‚Äì Alexander McQueen Profile Alexander McQueen Timeline Profile (June 2011) Givenchy designs released by Vogue Patterns during this period may be credited to the late designer.PatternVault blog (11 July 2011) Alexander McQueen for Givenchy: Vogue Patterns, Part 1 McQueen received press attention after the May 2007 suicide of international style icon Isabella Blow. Rumours were published that there was a rift between McQueen and Blow at the time of her death, focusing on McQueen's under-appreciation of Blow. In response to these rumours, McQueen told an interviewer: =VOSS= One of McQueen's most celebrated and dramatic catwalk shows was his 2001 Spring/Summer collection, named VOSS. The centre piece tableau that dominated the room was an enormous glass box. But because the room outside the box was lit and the inside of the box was unlit, the glass walls appeared as large mirrors, so that the seated audience saw only their own reflection. When the show began, lights came on inside the enormous glass case and revealed the interior to be filled with moths and, at the centre, a naked model on a chaise longue with her face obscured by a gas mask. The glass walls then fell away and smashed on the ground. The model chosen by McQueen to be the centre of the show was the British writer Michelle Olley. (The show also featured Kate Moss and Erin O'Connor). McQueen said that the tableau was based on the Joel Peter Witkin image Sanitarium. The British fashion photographer Nick Knight later said of the VOSS show on his SHOWstudio.com blog: > \\"The girl in the box was Michelle Olley. She modelled for me in a story I > did called Sister Honey... She was a writer and I remember she wrote a great > piece on being the Butterfly Girl in the middle of that (McQueen) Glass Box > show. I was sat on the front row, inbetween Alexandra Schulman and Gwyneth > Paltrow. It was probably one of the best pieces of Fashion Theatre I have > ever witnessed.\\" Alexander McQueen later described his thoughts on the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour: > \\"Ha! I was really pleased about that. I was looking at it on the monitor, > everyone trying not to look at themselves. It was a great thing to do in the > fashion industry‚Äîturn it back on them! God, I‚Äôve had some freaky shows.\\" In 2011, Michelle Olley was asked by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to contribute to their Alexander McQueen exhibition, Savage Beauty. She was interviewed by The Met about VOSS for the audio guide to the show. Olley's detailed diary/journal of modelling for McQueen‚Äîwritten between 18‚Äì27 September as the show was being planned and staged‚Äîwas included in the Met Museum website coverage of the Savage Beauty exhibition. The VOSS diary relates details of the show and encounters with McQueen, ending with how Olley returned home after the show to find: > \\"...a MASSIVE bouquet of flowers has arrived, with a note [from McQueen] > saying, \\"Thank you for everything ‚Äì you were beautiful! ‚Äì Lee > xxx\\"Metropolitan Museum of Art, Alexander MqQueen show 'Savage Beauty': > Michelle Olley 'VOSS' diary =Accomplishments= Some of McQueen's accomplishments included being one of the youngest designers to achieve the title \\"British Designer of the Year\\", which he won four times between 1996 and 2003; he was also appointed a CBE and named International Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers in 2003. December 2000 saw a new partnership for McQueen, with the Gucci Group's acquiring 51% of his company and McQueen's serving as Creative Director. Plans for expansion included the opening of stores in London, Milan, and New York, and the launch of his perfumes Kingdom and, most recently, My Queen. In 2005, McQueen collaborated with Puma to create a special line of trainers for the shoe brand. In 2006, he launched McQ, a younger, more renegade lower-priced line for men and women. McQueen became one of several designers to participate in MAC's promotion of cosmetic releases created by fashion designers. The collection was released on 11 October 2007 and reflected the looks used on the Autumn/Winter McQueen catwalk created by makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury. The inspiration for the collection was the 1963 Elizabeth Taylor movie Cleopatra, and thus the models sported intense blue, green, and teal eyes with strong black liner extended Egyptian-style. McQueen handpicked the makeup. =Company= McQueen boutique in London (2013) By the end of 2007, Alexander McQueen had boutiques in London, New York, Los Angeles, Milan, and Las Vegas. Celebrity patrons, including Nicole Kidman, Pen√©lope Cruz, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Rihanna, Monica Brown and J-pop queens, such as Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro, and Koda Kumi, have frequently been spotted wearing Alexander McQueen clothing to events. Bj√∂rk, Hamasaki, and Lady Gaga have often incorporated Alexander McQueen pieces in their music videos.Lady Gaga dances in Alexander McQueen's 10-inch Stilettos Huffington Post, 11 November 2009 Personal life McQueen was openly gay and said he realized his sexual orientation when he was six years old. He told his family when he was 18 and, after a rocky period, they accepted it. He described coming out at a young age by saying, \\"I was sure of myself and my sexuality and I've got nothing to hide. I went straight from my mother's womb onto the gay parade\\".Vogue Magazine, August 2002 In 2000, McQueen had a marriage ceremony with his partner George Forsyth, a documentary filmmaker, on a yacht in Ibiza. Kate Moss and Annabelle Neilson were bridesmaids. The marriage was not official, as same-sex marriage in Spain was not legal at that time. The relationship ended a year later, with the two maintaining a close friendship. McQueen was HIV positive. McQueen was an avid scuba diver and used his passion as a source of inspiration in his designs, including spring 2010's \\"Plato's Atlantis\\". Much of his diving was done around the Maldives.\\\\ McQueen had close relationships with the teams of designers he worked with and oversaw. His life was dedicated to his work, and his friend and colleague, Sebastian Pons described him as a workaholic. He held the work ethic of his colleagues to the same standard as himself, which ultimately created strife within his team, pushing Pons to quit his job and end his friendship with Lee. McQueen struggled with mental health issues. They worsened in the latter years of his life. His mental and physical well being were undoubtedly affected by the fast pace and high production volume of his work. His friends have commented on how before he died, he was no longer the jolly and chubby man they had known and loved; he was miserable and enslaved to his work. McQueen struggled greatly with the death of his mother on February 2, 2010. He never went to her funeral, as he was pronounced dead nine days later on February 11, 2010. Death and memorial McQueen's death was announced on the afternoon of 11 February 2010. In the morning, his housekeeper found him hanged at his home in Green Street, London W1. Paramedics were called and they pronounced him dead at the scene.Lee Alexander McQueen Headstone, Kilmuir, Isle of Skye. Lee Alexander McQueen Headstone Back, Kilmuir, Isle of Skye David LaChapelle, a friend of the designer, said that McQueen \\"was doing a lot of drugs and was very unhappy\\" at the time of his death. McQueen's death came just days before London Fashion Week, although he was not scheduled to appear there. Dr Stephen Pereira, McQueen's psychiatrist, said he had mixed anxiety and depressive disorder for at least three years and had twice taken drug overdoses as \\"cries for help\\". Pereira also said that McQueen had repeatedly missed psychiatric sessions, adding that there had been \\"enormous difficulty in getting him to personally, physically come to appointments\\". McQueen left a note saying, \\"Look after my dogs, sorry, I love you, Lee.\\" The Metropolitan Police stated that the note was not suspicious, but did not confirm that the death was a suicide. On 17 February 2010, Westminster Coroner's Court was told that a post-mortem examination found that McQueen's death was due to asphyxiation and hanging. The inquest was adjourned until 28 April 2010, where McQueen's death was officially recorded as suicide. McQueen, who had been diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, took an overdose prior to hanging himself. He had taken drug overdoses in May and July 2009. Coroner Dr Paul Knapman reported finding \\"a significant level of cocaine, sleeping pills, and tranquillizers in the blood samples taken after the designer's death.\\" On 3 February 2010, McQueen wrote on his Twitter page that his mother had died the day before, adding: \\"RIP mumxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.\\" Four days later, he wrote that he had had an \\"awful week\\" but said \\"friends have been great\\", adding: \\"now i have to some how pull myself together\\". McQueen is survived by his father, three sisters, and two brothers. McQueen's funeral took place on 25 February 2010 at St. Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, West London. His ashes were later scattered on the Isle of Skye at Kilmuir. His Skye ancestry had been a strong influence in his life and work. McQueen's Scottish heritage‚Äîhis father was born and had ancestral roots in Skye‚Äîwas evident in his life and work. Collections including Banshee (AW94-95) and Highland Rape (AW95-96) draw on both Celtic culture and dark periods of Scotland's history, notably the 18th-century suppression of Scotland's Highland clan system following the final defeat of the Jacobite rebellions. In asking for his remains to be interred in Kilmuir, looking over the sea in the north of Skye, Alexander McQueen has joined members of his clan going back over many generations. A memorial was held for McQueen at St. Paul's Cathedral on 20 September 2010. It was attended by Bj√∂rk, Kate Moss, Sarah Jessica Parker, Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Daphne Guinness, Sam Taylor-Johnson, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Lady Gaga and Anna Wintour amongst 2,500 other invited guests. On 18 February 2010, Robert Polet, the president and chief executive of the Gucci Group, announced that the Alexander McQueen business would carry on without its founder and creative director. Close friend Bj√∂rk performed a version of Gloomy Sunday while dressed in a McQueen gown. The BBC reported that McQueen had reserved ¬£50,000 of his wealth for his pet dogs so they could live in the lap of luxury for the rest of their lives. He also bequeathed ¬£100,000 each to four charities; these include the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in South London, and the Blue Cross animal welfare charity in Burford, Oxfordshire. = Human Leather of McQueen = There is a claim that skin grown using the DNA of the late designer has been turned into leather. Tributes A dedication by a fan at an Alexander McQueen store after McQueen's death On 16 February 2010, pop musician and friend Lady Gaga performed an acoustic, jazz rendition of her hit single \\"Telephone\\" and segued into \\"Dance in the Dark\\" at the 2010 Brit Awards. During the performance, Gaga paid tribute to McQueen, by dedicating a song to him. She also commemorated McQueen after accepting her award for Best International Artist, Best International Female, and Best International Album. Gaga dedicated a song to him, titled \\"Fashion of His Love\\", on the special edition of her third album, Born This Way. R&B; singer Monica dedicated her music video \\"Everything To Me\\" to the memory of the late Alexander McQueen, a fashion designer who Monica admired and whose gowns and other pieces appear in the video. McQueen was found dead at his London apartment three days before the video shooting. Bj√∂rk, wearing a McQueen outfit, sang her rendition of \\"Gloomy Sunday\\" at the memorial at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Various other musicians, who were friends and collaborators with McQueen, commentated on his death, including Kanye West, Courtney Love, and Katy Perry. In March 2010, celebrities including Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Annabelle Neilson, among others, paid visual tribute to McQueen by wearing his distinctive 'manta' dresses. The 'manta' dresses, inspired by a scuba-diving holiday McQueen took to the Maldives in 2009, came from McQueen's 'Plato's Atlantis' collection of Spring-Summer 2010 which was at the time currently available to purchase. 'Manta' dresses had been worn by celebrities such as Daphne Guinness, Noot Seear, Anna Paquin, and Lily Cole prior to his death, and following the announcement that he had died, remaining stocks sold out despite prices starting at ¬£2,800. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City hosted a posthumous exhibition of McQueen's work in 2011 titled Savage Beauty. The exhibition's elaborate staging includes unique architectural finishes and soundtracks for each room. Despite being open for only three months, it was one of the most popular exhibitions in the museum's history. The exhibition was so successful that Alexander McQueen fans and industry professionals worldwide began rallying at Change.org to \\"Please Make Alexander McQueen's Savage Beauty a Traveling Exhibition\\" to bring honour to McQueen and see his vision become a reality: to share his work with the entire world. The exhibition then appeared in London's Victoria & Albert Museum between 14 March and 2 August 2015. It sold over 480,000 tickets, making it the most popular show ever staged at that museum. In 2012, McQueen was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork‚Äîthe Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover‚Äîto celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires. McQueen is also given homage in the popular MMO World of Warcraft. There is an NPC dedicated to Alexander McQueen that is a Tailoring Trainer named Alexandra McQueen. This trainer is also the only one on the horde side that gives a special quest Cloth Scavenging. In February 2015, on the fifth anniversary of McQueen's death, a new play based on the designer was unveiled. McQueen, written by James Phillips, is set over one night in London and follows a girl who breaks into the designer's home to steal a dress and is caught by McQueen. The production takes inspiration from his imaginative runway shows and will be directed by John Caird. It has been described by McQueen's sister Janet as 'true to his spirit'. Stephen Wight and Dianna Agron played the leading roles. Final runway presentation Alexander McQueen's last appearance on a fashion show was in Plato's Atlantis, presented during Paris Fashion Week on 6 October 2009. This Spring/Summer 2010 collection was inspired by the post-human manifesto featuring 46 full looks. The show began with a video of Raquel Zimmerman lying naked on sand with snakes on her body. McQueen installed two large cameras on the runway, both of which moved back and forth, documenting and broadcasting the entire show live on SHOWstudio. The inspiration for Plato's Atlantis was nature and the post-human movement depicted by sea-reptile prints. The fashion show and the collection addresses Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. as well as current global warming issues. The fantasy collection, named after Plato's island that sunk in the sea, envisaged a future where humans are forced to evolve from living on land to living in water in order to survive. The color scheme changed during the show from green and brown (land) to blue and acqua (ocean). The models exhibited an androgynous look (which represents McQueen's evolutionary themes), as well as possessing post-human characteristics. The prints shifted from reptilian to prints of water creatures such as jellyfish and stingrays. The collection's final silhouettes gave the models marine features while the McQueen's signature Armadillo shoe also transformed the appearance of the models' anatomic foot. Plato's Atlantis was yet another way in which McQueen fused fashion with technology. Final show At the time of Alexander McQueen's death, he had an eighty percent finished Autumn/Winter collection. 16 pieces of this collection were presented during Paris Fashion Week on 8 March 2010, to a select handful of fashion editors in a mirrored, gilded salon at the 18th-century H√¥tel de Clermont-Tonnerre. Fashion editors picked his final designs. Editors said the show was hard to watch because it showed how McQueen was obsessed with the afterlife. The clothes had a medieval and religious look. Basic colours that were repetitively used were red, gold and silver with detailed embroidery. His models were accessorised to show his love for theatrical imagery. \\"Each piece is unique, as was he\\", McQueen's fashion house said in a statement that was released with the collection. After company owner Gucci confirmed that the brand would continue, McQueen's long-term assistant Sarah Burton was named as the new creative director of Alexander McQueen in May 2010. In September 2010, Burton presented her first womenswear collection in Paris. In film In 2016, it was announced that Jack O'Connell would play McQueen in an upcoming biographical film about his life.\\"Jack O'Connell to star in Alexander McQueen biopic\\". BBC News. Retrieved 6 October 2016 On 8 June 2018 the documentary McQueen written and directed by Ian Bonh√¥te and Peter Ettedgui was released in the UK. It was described by Harper's Bazaar as \\"among the most accurate, sensitive, and moving. Using his collections as cornerstones, the documentary features candid interviews with colleagues, friends and even family of McQueen, who was known as Lee to the people he loved.\\" The film was favourably reviewed, earning a score of 84 on the critical aggregator website Metacritic, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\", as well as a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with a Critics Consensus reading, \\"McQueen offers an intimate, well-sourced, and overall moving look at a young life and brilliant career that were tragically cut short.\\" References Further reading =Biographies= * Bolton, Andrew (2010), Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty, Metropolitan Museum of Art, * Knox, Kristin (2010), Alexander Mcqueen: Genius of a Generation, A & C Black Publishers Ltd, * Deniau, Anne (2012), Love Looks Not with the Eyes: Thirteen Years with Lee Alexander McQueen, Harry N.

Early life Maynard grew up in Texas. His father was a cotton broker, and with the family constantly moving, Don attended 13 schools, including five high schools. As a senior at Colorado City High School in Colorado City, Texas, he lettered in football, basketball and track. College career Maynard played collegiately for Rice University (one year), then for Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso). In three seasons (1954‚Äì56) with the Miners, he caught only 28 passes but averaged an astounding 27.6 yards per reception for 10 touchdowns. As a running back, he had 843 yards rushing on 154 attempts for a 5.4 average and also returned punts and kickoffs. He amassed 2,283 all-purpose yards, while also intercepting 10 passes playing defensive back. Professional career He was selected in the ninth round (109th overall) of the 1957 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. In 12 games as a rookie, he had 12 rushes for 45 yards (3.8 yards per carry), caught five passes for 84 yards (a 16.8 yard average) and played on special teams. After being released by the Giants during their 1959 training camp, he played one season in the Canadian Football League with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, catching just one pass for 10 yards.https://www.pro- football-reference.com/players/M/MaynDo00.htm In the off-season, he worked as a plumber and a teacher.http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2014/01/super_bowl_2014_jets_great_don_maynard_was_almost_a_green_bay_packer.html Maynard became the first player to sign with the New York Titans in 1960 (the team was renamed the Jets in 1963).http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=144 This came about because the Titans' first head coach, Sammy Baugh, had coached against Maynard in college and knew his talent. Although scorned by the New York press as an \\"NFL reject\\" in 1960, he teamed with Art Powell to form the first professional wide receiver tandem to each gain over 1,000 yards on receptions in a season, with the pair achieving this milestone again in 1962. Over the next 13 years Maynard put up receiving numbers that would earn him a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987. Collecting 72 pass receptions in his first year as a Titan, he went on to compile four more seasons with 50 or more catches and 1,000 yards receiving, and held the professional football record for total receptions and yards receiving. A four-time AFL All-Star, he is sixth in all-time pro football touchdown receptions, and is a member of the All-time All-AFL Team. In 1965 Maynard was teamed with rookie quarterback Joe Namath. Maynard had 1,218 yards on 68 receptions and 14 touchdowns in Namath's first season (Namath had 22 touchdown passes that year). In 1967, Maynard caught 1,434 of Namath's historic 4,007 passing yards. The receiving yards were a career-high for Maynard and led the league; he also had 71 receptions, 10 touchdowns, and averaged 20.2 yards per catch. In the 1968 season opener against Kansas City, Maynard had 200+ receiving yards for the first time in his career and passed Tommy McDonald as the active leader in receiving yards, where he remained for the next six seasons until his retirement.Don Maynard, Game Log He added a career-best 228 yards in Game 10 against Oakland. Maynard had 57 receptions for 1,297 yards (22.8 yards per catch) and 10 of Namath's 15 touchdowns that year. In the 1968 AFL Championship Game, a 27-23 Jets victory over the Oakland Raiders, Maynard caught six passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. His 14-yard catch in the first quarter gave the Jets the lead and his six-yard catch in the fourth quarter proved to be the game winner. The Jets would go on to win Super Bowl III, 16-7 over the NFL's Baltimore Colts, which was hailed as the first \\"upset\\" in Super Bowl history. Maynard played, but had no catches while suffering the effects of a hamstring injury in the AFL title game.http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbiii Maynard remarkably did not wear a chin strap on his helmet, instead using special cheek inserts that held the helmet tightly in place. After the 1972 season, he played for one year with the St. Louis Cardinals before finishing his playing career in 1974 with the Houston Texans / Shreveport Steamer of the WFL. One of only 20 players who were in the AFL for its entire 10-year existence, Maynard was also one of only seven players who played their entire AFL careers with one team. Maynard finished his career with 633 receptions for 11,834 yards and 88 touchdowns. His 18.7 yards per catch is the highest for anyone with at least 600 receptions. Post-NFL career Maynard in 2013 Following his NFL career, Maynard went on to participate in many charity-sponsored events. He also participated in the coin toss in Super Bowl XXXIII along with his former teammates, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the 1958 NFL Championship, which is also known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\". He was also once named the grand marshal in the annual El Paso Sun Bowl Thanksgiving Parade. He has worked as a math and industrial arts teacher, sold a variety of products and has been a financial planner, which he still dabbles in. Maynard currently resides in both El Paso and in Ruidoso, New Mexico to be near his son and daughter and two grandchildren. His son was also a coach in the Canadian Football League with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1990. Don and his wife Marilyn (Weaver), whom he met when she was a student at Texas Western, were married in December 1955 after his junior season. Marilyn died several years ago and Don has since remarried.https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&query;=%2Bgivenname%3Amarilyn~%20%2Bsurname%3Amaynard~%20%2Bbirth_place%3Atexas~%20%2Bbirth_year%3A1936-1937~%20%2Bdeath_place%3Atexas~%20%2Bdeath_year%3A1995-2010~ See also * List of American Football League players References External links Don Maynard discusses Super Bowl 3 Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:American football wide receivers Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats players Category:Houston Texans (WFL) players Category:New York Giants players Category:New York Jets players Category:New York Titans (AFL) players Category:Shreveport Steamer players Category:St. Louis Cardinals (football) players Category:UTEP Miners football players Category:American Football League All-Star players Category:American Football League champions Category:American Football League All-Time Team Category:National Football League players with retired numbers Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Crosby County, Texas Category:Super Bowl champions Category:American Football League players Category:People from El Paso, Texas Category:People from Ruidoso, New Mexico Category:Players of American football from Texas ","title":"Don Maynard"},{"id":"397815","text":"Louis Maimbourg.

It is about WSW of Princes Risborough, and is on the county boundary with Oxfordshire. The toponym \\"Bledlow\\" is derived from Old English and means \\"Bledda's burial mound\\". A 10th century document records it as Bleddanhloew; the Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Bledelai. A more common derivation is from \\"Bled-Hlaw\\" meaning Bloody Hill which commemorates an undated battle between Saxons and Danes. Geography The village is on the ancient Icknield Way and is where several springs form a small pool called the Lyde. The water from the springs is said to wear away the chalk on which the village stands, giving rise to the simple local medieval nursery rhyme: The brook running from the pool into the nearby valley (called the Lyde Brook) provided water power for two watermills for many years. Bledlow's watermill is a tourist attraction. Above the village, carved into the chalk of Wain Hill is a large cross, similar to that found at Whiteleaf. There is also a round barrow on the hill. It is thought that this is the barrow or burial mound referred to in the village name. Within the parish of Bledlow-cum-Saunderton are several hamlets. The main one is Bledlow Ridge. The others are Forty Green (not to be confused with Forty Green near Beaconsfield), Pitch Green, Rout's Green, Skittle Green and Holly Green. Parish church The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity overlooks the Vale of Aylesbury. It has two aisles and the nave arcades include capitals made in about 1200. Other features of interest are the font, some fragments of wall paintings, and the 13th- or 14th-century south doorway and porch. It is a Grade I listed building. Notable people Actress Samantha Eggar lived in Bledlow as a child, and was a neighbour of Oliver Reed while there. Transport Bledlow railway station was an intermediate station on the Wycombe Railway that served the village from 1862 to 1963. It was the first of two stations to serve the village, the second being on the Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway. It was to the south and closer to the village. It was opened in 1906 and closed in 1957. The potential for reopening the Wycombe Railway through Bledlow, which is now part of a long-distance footpath, was evaluated and dismissed by Chiltern Railways, the franchise holder for the Chiltern Main Line that runs through Princes Risborough.

With time the principality grew into a grand duchy divided into several smaller principalities. After being conquered by the Mongol Empire, the principality became a self-governed state headed by its own nobility. A governorship of principality, however, was prescribed by a Khan declaration (jarlig) issued from the Golden Horde to a noble family of any of smaller principalities. Vladimir-Suzdal is traditionally perceived as a cradle of the Great Russian language and nationality, and it gradually evolved into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Origin =Rostov principality= The first notable administrators in the Rostov region presumably were the sons of Vladimir the Great, Boris and Gleb, and later Yaroslav the Wise. The principality occupied a vast territory in the northeast of Kievan Rus', approximately bounded by the Volga, Oka, and Northern Dvina rivers. According to the archeologist Andrei Leontiev, who specializes in the history of the region, the Rostov land until the 10th century was already under the control of Rostov city, while Sarskoye Gorodishche was a tribal center of the native Merya people. In the 10th century an eparchy was established in Rostov. One of the first known princes was Yaroslav the Wise and later Boris Vladimirovich. At that time Rostov was the major center of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the region dominated mostly by shamanism. Until the 11th century Rostov was often associated with the Great Novgorod. Evidently the spread of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to the lands of the Great Perm was successfully conducted from Rostov. Rostov was the regional capital, including other important towns included Suzdal, Yaroslavl, and Belozersk. =Rostov-Suzdal= Vladimir Monomakh, son of the Grand Prince of Vsevolod I, inherited the rights to the principality in 1093. As the Grand Prince of Kiev he appointed his son George I to rule the northeastern lands and in 1125 moved its capital from Rostov to Suzdal, after which the Principality was referred to as Rostov- Suzdal.Yury Dolgoruky in Grand Soviet Encyclopedia During the 11th and 12th centuries when southern parts of Rus' were systematically raided by Turkic nomads, their inhabitants began to migrate northward. In the formerly wooded areas, known as Zalesye, many new settlements were established. The foundations of Pereslavl, Kostroma, Dmitrov, Moscow, Yuriev-Polsky, Uglich, Tver, Dubna, and many others were assigned (either by chronicle or popular legend) to George I, whose sobriquet (\\"the Long-Armed\\") alludes to his dexterity in manipulating the politics of far-away Kiev. Sometime in 1108 Monomakh strengthened and rebuilt the town of Vladimir on the Klyazma River, 31 km south of Suzdal. During the rule of George I the principality gained military strength, and in the Suzdal-Ryazan war of 1146 it conquered the Ryazan Principality. Later in the 1150s Yuri occupied Kiev a couple of times as well. From that time the lands of the northeastern Rus' played an important role in the politics of Kievan Rus'. Rise of Vladimir The veneration of the Theotokos as a holy protectress of Vladimir was introduced by Prince Andrew, who dedicated to Her many churches and installed in his palace a revered image, known as Theotokos of Vladimir. George's son Andrew the Pious significantly increased Vladimir's power at the expense of the nearby princely states, which he treated with contempt. After burning down Kiev, then the metropolitan seat of Rus', in 1169, he enthroned his younger brother. For Andrew, his capital of Vladimir was a far greater concern, as he embellished it with white stone churches and monasteries. Prince Andrew was murdered by boyars in his suburban residence at Bogolyubovo in 1174. After a brief interregnum, Andrew's brother Vsevolod III secured the throne. He continued most of his brother's policies and once again subjugated Kiev in 1203. Vsevolod's chief enemies, however, were the Southern Ryazan Principality, which appeared to stir discord in the princely family, and the mighty Turkic state of Volga Bulgaria, which bordered Vladimir-Suzdal to the east. After several military campaigns, Ryazan was burnt to the ground, and the Bulgars were forced to pay tribute. Vsevolod's death in 1212 precipitated a serious dynastic conflict. His eldest son Konstantin gained the support of powerful Rostovan boyars and Mstislav the Bold of Kiev and expelled the lawful heir, his brother George, from Vladimir to Rostov. George managed to return to the capital six years later, upon Konstantin's death. George proved to be a shrewd ruler who decisively defeated Volga Bulgaria and installed his brother Yaroslav in Novgorod. His reign, however, ended when the Mongol hordes under Batu Khan took and burnt Vladimir in 1238. Thereupon they proceeded to devastate other major cities of Vladimir-Suzdal during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'.  Mongol yoke  Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir was built in 1158-1160 and functioned as the mother church of Kievan Rus' in the 13th century. None of the cities of the principality managed to regain the power of the Great Kievan Rus' after the Mongol invasion. Vladimir became a vassal of the Mongol Empire, later succeeded by the Golden Horde, with the Grand Prince appointed by the Great Khan. Even the popular Alexander Nevsky of Pereslavl had to go to the Khan's capital in Karakorum in order to be installed as the Grand Prince in Vladimir. As many factions strove for power, the principality rapidly disintegrated into eleven tiny states: Moscow, Tver, Pereslavl, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Uglich, Belozersk, Kostroma, Nizhny Novgorod, Starodub- upon-Klyazma, and Yuriev-Polsky. All of them nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Grand Prince of Vladimir, but his effective authority became progressively weaker. By the end of the century, only three cities -- Moscow, Tver, and Nizhny Novgorod -- still contended for the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir. Once installed, however, they chose to remain in their own cities rather than moving to Vladimir. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually came to eclipse its rivals. When the metropolitan of Kievan Rus' moved his chair from Vladimir to Moscow in 1325, it became clear that Moscow had effectively succeeded Vladimir as the chief centre of power in the north-east remnant of Kievan Rus'.

Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it is neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus Chrysocyon (meaning \\"golden dog\\"). It is the largest canid in South America, with a weight between 20 and 30 kg, and reaches up to 90 cm at the withers. Its long, thin legs and dense reddish coat give it an unmistakable appearance. The maned wolf is a crepuscular and omnivorous animal adapted to the open environments of the South American savanna, with an important role in the seed dispersal of fruits, especially the wolf apple (Solanum lycocarpum). The maned wolf is a solitary animal. It communicates primarily by scent marking, but also gives a loud call known as \\"roar-barking\\". This mammal is found in open and semi open habitats, especially grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the Cerrado of south, central-west, and southeastern Brazil; Paraguay; northern Argentina; and Bolivia east and north of the Andes, and far southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It is very rare in Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely through loss of habitat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as near threatened, while it is considered a vulnerable species by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources.  Etymology  The term Maned wolf, as the Crin Wolf in Spanish, is an allusion to the mane of the nape. It is known locally as aguar√° guaz√∫ (meaning \\"large fox\\" in the Guarani language), or kalak in the Toba Qom language, lobo de crin, lobo de los esteros, or lobo colorado, and lobo-guar√° in Brazil. The term lobo, \\"wolf\\", originates from the Latin lupus. Guar√° and aguar√° originated from tupi-guarani agoa'r√°, \\"by the fuzz\\". It also is called borochi in Bolivia.Ferreira, A. B. H. (1986). Novo Dicion√°rio da L√≠ngua Portuguesa 2¬™ ed. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira Taxonomy Although the maned wolf displays many fox-like characteristics, it is not closely related to foxes. It lacks the elliptical pupils found distinctively in foxes. The maned wolf's evolutionary relationship to the other members of the canid family makes it a unique animal. Electrophoretic studies did not link Chrysocyon with any of the other living canids studied. One conclusion of this study is that the maned wolf is the only species among the large South American canids that survived the late Pleistocene extinction. Fossils of the maned wolf from the Holocene and the late Pleistocene have been excavated from the Brazilian Highlands. A 2003 study on the brain anatomy of several canids placed the maned wolf together with the Falkland Islands wolf and with pseudo-foxes of the genus Pseudalopex. One study based on DNA evidence showed that the extinct genus Dusicyon, comprising the Falkland Islands wolf and its mainland relative, was the most closely related species to the maned wolf in historical times, and that about seven million years ago it shared a common ancestor with that genus. A 2015 study reported genetic signatures in maned wolves that are indicative of population expansion followed by contraction that took place during Pleistocene interglaciations about 24,000 years before present. The maned wolf is not closely related to any other living canid. It is not a fox, wolf, coyote, dog, or jackal, but a distinct canid, though, based only on morphological similarities, it previously had been placed in the Canis and Vulpes genera. Its closest living relative is the bush dog (genus Speothos), and it has a more distant relationship to other South American canines (the short-eared dog, the crab-eating fox, and the zorros or Lycalopex). Description Video of captive maned wolf at Singapore Zoo The species was described in 1815 by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, initially as Canis brachyurus. Lorenz Oken classified him as Vulpes cancosa, and only in 1839 did Charles Hamilton Smith describe the genus Chrysocyon. Other authors later considered him as a member of the Canis genus. Fossils of Chrysocyon dated from the Late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs were collected in one of Peter Wilheim Lund expeditions to Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais (Brazil). The specimen is kept in the South American Collection of the Zoologisk Museum, Denmark. Since there is no other record of fossils in other areas, is suggested that the species evolved in this geographic region. The maned wolf bears minor similarities to the red fox, although it belongs to a different genus. The average adult weighs and stands tall at the shoulder, has a head-body length of with the tail adding another . Its ears are large and long (7 inches). The maned wolf is the tallest of the wild canids; its long legs are likely an adaptation to the tall grasslands of its native habitat. Fur of the maned wolf may be reddish-brown to golden orange on the sides with long, black legs, and a distinctive black mane. The coat is marked further with a whitish tuft at the tip of the tail and a white \\"bib\\" beneath the throat. The mane is erectile and typically is used to enlarge the wolf's profile when threatened or when displaying aggression. Melanistic maned wolves do exist, but are rare. The first photograph of a black adult maned wolf was taken by a camera trap in northern Minas Gerais in Brazil in 2013. Skull of a maned wolf The skull can be identified by its reduced carnassials, small upper incisors and long canine teeth. Like other canids, it has 42 teeth with the dental formula . The maned wolf's rhinarium extends to the upper lip, similar to the bush dog, but its vibrissae are longer. The skull also features a prominent sagittal crest. The maned wolf's footprints are similar to those of the dog, but have disproportionately small plantar pads when compared to the well-opened digit marks. The dog has pads up to 3 times larger than the maned wolf's footprint. These pillows have a triangular shape. The front footprints are 7 to 9 cm long and 5.5 to 7 cm wide, and those of the hind feet are 6.5 to 9 cm long and 6.5 to 8.5 cm wide. One feature that differentiates the maned wolf's footprint from that of other South American canids is the proximal union of the third and fourth digits. =Genetics= Genetically, the maned wolf has 37 pairs of autosomes within diploid genes, with a karyotype similar to that of other canids. It has 76 chromosomes, and therefore cannot interbreed with other canids. Evidence suggests that 15,000 years ago, the species suffered a reduction in its genetic diversity, called the bottleneck effect. However, its diversity is still greater than that of other canids. The maned wolf also is known for the distinctive odor of its territory markings, which has earned it the nickname \\"skunk wolf\\". Ecology and behavior = Hunting and territoriality = The maned wolf is a twilight animal, but its activity pattern is more related to the relative humidity and temperature, similar to that observed with the bush dog (Speothos venaticus). Peak activity occurs between 8am and 10am in the morning and 8pm and 10pm in the night time. On cold or cloudy days they can be active all day. The species is likely to use open fields for foraging and more closed areas, such as riparian forests, to rest, especially on warmer days. Unlike most large canid species (such as the gray wolf, the African hunting dog, or the dhole), the maned wolf is a solitary animal and does not form packs. It typically hunts alone, usually between sundown and midnight, rotating its large ears to listen for prey animals in the grass. They tap the ground with a front foot to flush out the prey and pounce to catch it. They kill prey by biting on the neck or back, and shaking the prey violently if necessary. Monogamous pairs may defend a shared territory around , although outside of mating, the individuals may meet only rarely. The territory is crisscrossed by paths that they create as they patrol at night. Several adults may congregate in the presence of a plentiful food source, for example, a fire-cleared patch of grassland that would leave small vertebrate prey exposed while foraging. Both female and male maned wolves use their urine to communicate,Garcia, Agnaldo. \\"On the social behaviour of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus).\\" Boletim de Zoologia da Universidade de Sao Paulo 6 (1983): 63-77. e.g. to mark their hunting paths or the places where they have buried hunted prey. The urine has a very distinctive odor, which some people liken to hops or cannabis. The responsible substance very likely is a pyrazine, which also occurs in both plants. (At the Rotterdam Zoo, this smell once set the police on a hunt for cannabis smokers.S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 2006-09-02, p3) The preferred habitat of the maned wolf includes grasslands, scrub prairies, and forests. =Reproduction and life cycle= A maned wolf and pup at White Oak Conservation Their mating season ranges from November to April. Gestation lasts 60 to 65 days and a litter may have from two to six black-furred pups, each weighing roughly . Pups are fully grown when one year old. During that first year, the pups rely on their parents for food. Data on the maned wolf's estrus and reproductive cycle mainly comes from captive animals, particularly about breeding endocrinology. However, studies have found that hormonal changes of maned wolves in the wild follow the same variation pattern of those in captivity. Females ovulate spontaneously, but some authors suggest that the presence of a male is important for estrus induction. Captive animals in the Northern Hemisphere breed between October and February and in the Southern Hemisphere between August and October. This indicates that photoperiod plays an important role in maned wolf reproduction, mainly due to the production of semen. Generally, one estrus occurs per year. The amount of sperm produced by the maned wolf is lower compared to that of other canids. Copulation occurs during the four-day estrus period and is followed by up to 15 minutes of sexual intercourse. Courtship is similar to that of other canids, characterized by frequent approaches and anogenital investigation. Gestation lasts 60 to 65 days and a litter may have from two to six pups. One litter of seven has been recorded. Birthing has been observed in May in the Canastra Mountains, but data from captive animals suggest that births are concentrated between June and September. The maned wolf reproduces with difficulty in the wild, with a high rate of infant mortality. Females can go up to two years without breeding. Breeding in captivity is even more difficult, especially in temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Pups are born weighing between 340 and 430 grams. They begin their lives with black fur, becoming red after ten weeks. The eyes open at about 9 days of age. They are breastfed up to 4 months. Afterwards, they are fed by their parents via regurgitation, starting on the 3rd week of age and lasting up to 10 months. Three-month-old pups begin to accompany their mother while she forages. Males and females both engage in parental care, but it is primarily done by the females. Data on male parental care has been collected from captive animals and little is known whether this occurs frequently the wild. Maned wolves reach sexual maturity at 1 year of age, when they leave their birth territory. The maned wolf's longevity in the wild is unknown, but estimates in captivity are between 12 and 15 years. There is a report of an individual at the S√£o Paulo Zoo who lived to be 22 years old. =Diet= wolf apple, one of the main plant foods of the maned wolf The maned wolf is omnivorous. It specialises in preying on small and medium-sized animals, including small mammals (typically rodents and rabbits), birds, and even fish, but a large portion of its diet (more than 50%, according to some studies) is vegetable matter, including sugarcane, tubers, and fruit. Up to 301 food items have been recorded in the maned wolf's diet, including 116 plants and 178 animal species. The maned wolf hunts by chasing its prey, digging holes, and jumping to catch birds in flight. About 21% of hunts are successful. Some authors have recorded active pursuits of the Pampas deer. They were also observed feeding on carcasses of run down animals. Fecal analysis has shown consumption of the giant anteater, bush dog, and collared peccary, but it is not known whether these animals are actively hunted or scavenged. Armadillos are also commonly consumed. Animals are more often consumed in the dry season. The wolf apple (Solanum lycocarpum), a tomato-like fruit, is the maned wolf's most common food item. With some exceptions, these fruits make up between 40 and 90% of the maned wolf's diet. The wolf apple is actively sought by the maned wolf, and is consumed throughout the year, unlike other fruits that can only be eaten in abundance during the rainy season. It can consume several fruits at a time and disperse intact seeds by defecating, making it an excellent disperser of the wolf apple plant. Despite their preferred habitat, maned wolves are ecologically flexible and can survive in disturbed habitats, from burned areas to places with high human influences. Burned areas have some small mammals, such as hairy-tailed bolo mouse (Necromys lasiurus) and vesper mouse (Calomys spp.) that they can hunt and survive on. Historically, captive maned wolves were fed meat-heavy diets, but that caused them to develop bladder stones. Zoo diets for them now feature fruits and vegetables, as well as meat and specialized extruded diet formulated for maned wolves to be low in stone- causing compounds (i.e. cystine). =Relations with other species= The maned wolf participates in symbiotic relationships. It contributes to the propagation and dissemination of the plants on which it feeds, through excretion. Often, maned wolves defecate on the nests of leafcutter ants. The ants then use the dung to fertilize their fungus gardens, but they discard the seeds contained in the dung onto refuse piles just outside their nests. This process significantly increases the germination rate of the seeds. They are parasitized by ticks, mainly of the genus Amblyomma, and by flies such as Cochliomyia hominivorax, usually on the ears. Interestingly, the maned wolf is poorly parasitized by fleas. The sharing of territory with domestic dogs results in a number of diseases, such as rabies virus, parvovirus, distemper virus, canine adenovirus, protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, bacterium Leptospira interrogans, and nematode Dirofilaria immitis. The maned wolf is particularly susceptible to potentially fatal infection by the giant kidney worm. It has been suggested that ingestion of the wolf apple could prevent maned wolves from contracting this nematode, but such a hypothesis has been questioned by several authors. Its predators are mainly large cats, such as the puma (Puma concolor) and the jaguar (Panthera onca), but it is most often preyed upon by the jaguar. Relations with humans Generally, the maned wolf is shy and flees when alarmed, so it poses little direct threat to humans. Popularly, the maned wolf is thought to have the potential of being a chicken thief. It once was considered a similar threat to cattle and sheep, although this now is known to be false. Historically, in a few parts of Brazil, these animals were hunted for some body parts, notably the eyes, that were believed to be good- luck charms. Since its classification as a vulnerable species by the Brazilian government, it has received greater consideration and protection. They are threatened by habitat loss and being run over by automobiles. Feral and domestic dogs pass on diseases to them, and have been known to attack them. The species occurs in several protected areas, including the national parks of Cara√ßa and Emas in Brazil. The maned wolf is well represented in captivity and has been bred successfully at many zoos, particularly in Argentina, North America (part of a Species Survival Plan) and Europe (part of a European Endangered Species Programme). In 2012, a total of 3,288 maned wolves were kept at more than 300 institutions worldwide. The Smithsonian National Zoo Park has been working to protect maned wolves for nearly 30 years, and coordinates the collaborative, interzoo maned wolf Species Survival Plan of North America, which includes breeding maned wolves, studying them in the wild, protecting their habitat, and educating people about them.  Conservation  The maned wolf is not considered an endangered species by the IUCN because of its wide geographical distribution and adaptability to man- made environments. But their populations have been declining and the species may be in some threat category soon, so the IUCN classifies it as a near- threatened species. Until 1996 the maned wolf was a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It is also listed in CITES Appendix II, which does not characterize it as threatened but notes that if there are no conservation measures, the species may fall into some category of threat in the future. The ICMBio list in Brazil that follows the same IUCN criteria considers the wolf to be a vulnerable species. By these same criteria, the Brazilian state lists also consider it more problematic: it is a vulnerable species in the lists of S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais, while in the lists of Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul the maned wolf is considered as \\"endangered\\" and \\"critically endangered\\" respectively. In Uruguay, although there is no such list as Brazil and IUCN, it is regarded as a species with \\"priority\\" for conservation. In Argentina it is not considered to be in critical danger, but it is recognized that its populations are declining and are fragmented.Soler, L. (2013). ¬´Maned Wolf in Argentina¬ª.

In human cultures  Human attitudes and opinions about the maned wolf vary across populations, ranging from fear and tolerance to aversion. In some regions of Brazil, parts of the animal's body are believed to help cure bronchitis, kidney disease, and even snake bites. It is also believed that it can bring good luck. These parts can be teeth, the heart, ears and even dry stools. In Bolivia it is believed that mounting a saddle made of maned wolf leather protects from bad luck. Despite these superstitions, there is no large-scale use of parts of this animal. In urban societies in Brazil people tend to be sympathetic to the maned wolf, seeing no values in it as a hunting animal or pest. They often consider its preservation to be important, and although these societies associate it with force and ferocity, they do not consider it a dangerous animal. Although popular in some places and common in many zoos, it can go unnoticed. Studies in zoos in Brazil showed that up to 30% of respondents were either unaware or unable to recognize a maned wolf. It was considered a common animal by the Guarani people and the first names used by Europeans, such as the Spanish jesuit missionary Joseph of Anchieta, were the same used by the native peoples (yaguara√ß√∫). The Spanish naturalist Felix de Azara also used the Guarani name to describe it. Azara was also one of the first to describe the biology of the species and consider it an important part of Paraguay's fauna. Much of the negative view of the maned wolf as a poultry predator stems from European ethnocentrism, where peasants often had problems with wolves and foxes. The maned wolf rarely causes antipathy in the human populations of the places in which it lives. For this reason it has been used as a flag species for the preservation of the Brazilian cerrado. It is represented on the 200 reais banknote, released in September 2020. Ag√™ncia Brasil. Retrieved 2020-09-03 It has also been represented on the 100 cruzeiros reais coin, which circulated in Brazil between 1993 and 1994.

Though not particularly high, compared to other peaks within Scotland, the mountain is very prominent, owing to its isolation and the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain, and dominates the skyline from several viewpoints. The peak that stands out the most visually is Mither Tap (518 m, 1699 feet) and from its top there are good views of the county to the north and east. Most of the tops lie along an east / west ridge, with the exception of Millstone Hill (409 m) an outlier or spur which is separated from and to the south of the main ridge. Mither Tap has an Iron Age fort on its summit. Unlike with many other hilltop forts in the area, there are no signs of vitrification in the stone. Bennachie is visible from a number of distant points; to the north it is visible from Longman Hill, a point considerably to the north.Michael Hogan, C. \\"Longman Hill\\", Longman Hill, 2008, Modern Antiquarian  History  Some believe that the peak had religious significance to the Bronze Age people who inhabited this area. This theory is supported by the large number of standing stones in the surrounding area. The significance is believed to be connected to the profile of the hill, which is shaped like a female breast, which is reflected in the name \\"Mither Tap\\" (Mother Top) and \\"Bennachie\\" (Beinn na Ciche: 'hill of the breast'). It has been suggested as a possible site of the battle of Mons Graupius. An alternative Gaelic etymology from *Beinn a' Chath, i.e. 'hill of the battle', is perhaps a possibility. From 1800 to 1859 common land on the east side of Bennachie was home to a community of squatters known locally as the Colony.Fagen, J. \\"Echoes of the Bennachie Colonists\\" , Leopard Magazine, Retrieved on 2009-08-11 A small number of families led a crofting life often doing skilled work, such as dyking and quarrying, for local landowners. After 1859 the Colony dwindled as the common land was broken up and divided amongst the local estates. However, the last of the original colonists, George Esson, lived on the hill until his death in the 1930s. Visitors to Bennachie can explore the remains of the Colony and extensive work is being done on site and amongst local parish records to determine the history of the Colonists. Mither Tap has an astronomical alignment with the nearby Pictish Fortalice of Caskieben (currently located within Keith Hall).

The Gordon Way is a waymarked trail that traverses the Southern flank of Bennachie between the Visitors Centre in the East and Suie Car Park to the West. Most of the Bennachie range is owned by Forestry and Land Scotland, which maintains a network of paths on and around the hills, several car parks and a visitor centre located at the eastern foot of the range. A volunteer group, the Bailies of Bennachie, founded in 1973, helps with this work and with other environmental and archaeological activities on the hill.

It is situated in the south-west of Milton Keynes, and is split between the civil parishes of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford and West Bletchley. Bletchley is best known for Bletchley Park, the headquarters of Britain's World War II codebreaking organisation, and now a major tourist attraction. The National Museum of Computing is also located on the Park. History =Origin= The town name is Anglo-Saxon and means Bl√¶cca's clearing. It was first recorded in manorial rolls in the 12th century as Bicchelai, then later as Blechelegh (13th century) and Blecheley (14th‚Äì16th centuries). Just to the south of Fenny Stratford, there was Romano-British town, MAGIOVINIUM on either side of Watling Street, a Roman road. =Bletchley Park= The main house at Bletchley Park Within the West Bletchley parish, in the Church Green district, is Bletchley Park, which, during the Second World War, was home to the Government Code and Cypher School. The German Enigma code was cracked here by, amongst others, Alan Turing. Another cipher machine was solved with the aid of early computing devices, known as Colossus. The park is now a museum, although many areas of the park grounds have been sold off for housing development. Development Bletchley grew from an obscure hamlet on the road from Fenny Stratford to Buckingham with the arrival of the London and North Western Railway in 1845 and its subsequent junction with the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Line shortly afterwards. Bletchley grew rapidly to service the junction. Bletchley railway station was for many years an important node on the railway. It is now one of the five stations which serve Milton Keynes. =\\"Bigger, Better, Brighter\\" ‚Äì Bletchley in the 20th century= Almost forty years after the construction of Bletchley railway station, the 1884/5 Ordnance Survey shows Bletchley as still just a small village around the C of E church at Bletchley Park, and a (separate) hamlet near the Methodist chapel and Shoulder of Mutton public house at the junction of Shenley Road/Newton Road with Buckingham Road.Ordnance Survey County Series, 1st edition, 1:10560, Tile 03sp83se, Buckinghamshire (These districts are known today as Old Bletchley and Far Bletchley). The major settlement of the time is nearby Fenny Stratford. In the urban growth of the Victorian period brought by the railway, the town merged with Fenny Stratford. The latter had been constituted an urban district (with Simpson) in 1895, and Bletchley was added in 1898. By 1911, the population of the combined parishes was 5,166 but the balance between them had changed: in that year, the name of the local council (Urban District) changed from Fenny Stratford UD to Bletchley UD. The 1926 Ordnance Survey shows the settlements beginning to merge, with large private houses along the Bletchley Road between them. In 1933, the newly founded Bletchley Gazette began a campaign for a \\"Bigger, Better, Brighter, Bletchley\\".Bigger Brighter Better ‚Äì Ed. Marion Hill (http://www.livingarchive.org.uk) As the nation emerged from World War II, Bletchley Council renewed its desire to expand from its 1951 population of 10,919. By mid-1952, the Council was able to agree terms with five London Boroughs to accept people and businesses from bombed-out sites in London. This trend continued through the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the GLC-funded Lakes Estate in Water Eaton parish, even as Milton Keynes was being founded. Industrial development kept pace, with former London businesses relocating to new industrial estates in Mount Farm and Denbigh ‚Äì Marshall Amplification being the most notable. With compulsory purchase, Bletchley Road (now renamed to Queensway after a royal visit in 1966) became the new high street with wide pavements where front gardens once lay. Houses near the railway end were replaced by shops but those nearer Fenny Stratford became banks and professional premises. At the 1971 Census, the population of the Bletchley Urban District was 30,642. =Bletchley in Milton Keynes= Proposals for a new city in North Buckinghamshire had been floated from the early 1960s. Bletchley had fought to be the centre of the proposed new city, but it was not to be. The 1971 Plan for Milton Keynes placed Central Milton Keynes on a completely new hill-top site four miles further north, half way to Wolverton. Bletchley was relegated to the status of suburb. Bletchley thrived in the early years of the growth of Milton Keynes, since it was the main shopping area. Bletchley centre was altered considerably when the Brunel Shopping Centre was built in the early 1970s, creating a new end to Queensway. (Previously, Queensway ‚Äì formerly known as Bletchley Road ‚Äì was a continuous run from Fenny Stratford to Old Bletchley). Bletchley's boom came to an end when the new Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre was built and commercial Bletchley has declined as a retail destination since then. Civil parishes: Bletchley and Fenny Stratford, and West Bletchley For more details about the districts of Bletchley, see these civil parish articles. The Bletchley built- up area is divided for administrative purposes into two civil parishes, Bletchley and Fenny Stratford and West Bletchley The districts that make up Bletchley and Fenny Stratford CP are: Brickfields (includes the Blue Lagoon), Central Bletchley, Denbigh (including Denbigh North), Eaton Manor, Fenny Stratford, Granby, Manor Farm, Mount Farm, Newton Leys and Water Eaton (includes \\"Lakes Estate\\"). At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 15,313. West Bletchley CP covers that part of Milton Keynes that is south of Standing Way (A421), west of the West Coast Main Line and north of the Varsity Line. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 15,313. The districts and neighbourhoods in the parish are: Church Green (including Bletchley Park); Far Bletchley; Old Bletchley; West Bletchley (district); Whaddon (ward around Whaddon Way, not to be confused with nearby Whaddon in Aylesbury Vale). Transport The town is served by Bletchley railway station, on Sherwood Drive and Bletchley Bus Station, on South Terrace off Saxon Street. Sport and leisure Bletchley has a rugby union club, Bletchley RUFC, both of which play at Manor Fields just south of Fenny Stratford. Stadium MK, home of Milton Keynes Dons is at the northern edge of the town. Political representation Bletchley is divided between three electoral wards of Milton Keynes Council, consisting of Bletchley East (3 Labour), Bletchley West (2 Labour, 1 Conservative) and Bletchley Park (1 Labour, 2 Conservative), and is in the parliamentary constituency of Milton Keynes South. ONS built up area For the 2011 census, the Office for National Statistics designated a \\"built up area sub-division\\", being that part of Milton Keynes that is west of the A5 and south of the A421, some . At the 2011 census, the population of the area was 37,114.

The Mini Guppy is one of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. Mini Guppy versions Two versions of the Mini Guppy were produced. Both versions are colloquially referred to as the \\"Mini Guppy\\". Both Mini Guppies were built using parts salvaged from a surplus Boeing 377, but with an all-new fuselage. This enabled Aero Spacelines to widen the Mini Guppy cargo bay floor to 13 ft (4 m), as opposed to the 8 ft (2.4 m) restriction imposed when building directly onto a B-377 fuselage. Borrowed parts included the cockpit, wings, and tail. =Mini Guppy= The cargo area of the Mini Guppy The Mini Guppy, or \\"MG\\", was built with a swing-tail to facilitate cargo loading. It was powered by the original Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major piston engines, enabling it to carry a maximum load of 32,000 pounds (14,500 kg), and cruise at 250 mph (400 km/h). Its cargo bay was 18 ft (5.5 m) in diameter, and a maximum of 91 ft 6 in (27.9 m) long, with a 73 ft 2 in (22.3 m) constant section. The Mini Guppy first flew on May 24, 1967, and Aero Spacelines operated it for several years, ferrying contract cargo, including NASA's famed Pioneer 10 space probe and the Goodyear Europa until it was sold to American Jet Industries in 1974. American Jet Industries sold it to Aero Union in 1980, who sold it to Erickson Air Crane eight years later. Erickson Air Crane used the Mini Guppy to haul heavy equipment until 1995, when it was retired to the Tillamook Air Museum in Tillamook, Oregon, where it resides today. = Mini Guppy Turbine = The second version was officially known as the Mini Guppy Turbine (MGT) and Guppy 101. It was the first Guppy aircraft to feature upgraded Allison 501-D22C turboprop engines. Like the MG, the MGT had a 73 ft 2 in (22.3 m) constant diameter section of the cargo hold, but the overall length had been increased to 103 ft 2 in (31.4 m), and the diameter was slightly wider: 18 ft 4 in (5.6 m). This, combined with the upgraded engines, enabled it to carry a maximum payload of 62,925 pounds (28,540 kg), almost twice the load the MG could handle. It was built with a swing-nose for easier cargo loading. Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy transporting a salvaged Dassault Falcon 20C. The MGT first took to the air on March 13, 1970, but was short-lived. On May 12, 1970, the Mini Guppy Turbine was lost, along with the entire crew, in an accident during flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

Baird was the first curator to be named at the Smithsonian Institution. He would eventually serve as assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian from 1850 to 1878, and as Secretary from 1878 until 1887. He was dedicated to expanding the natural history collections of the Smithsonian which he increased from 6,000 specimens in 1850 to over 2 million by the time of his death. He published over 1,000 works during his lifetime. Early life and education Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1823. His mother was a member of the prominent Philadelphia Biddle family; he was a nephew of Speaker of the Pennsylvania Senate Charles B. Penrose and a first cousin, once removed, of U.S. Senator Boies Penrose and his distinguished brothers, Richard, Spencer, and Charles. He became a self-trained naturalist as a young man, learning about the field from his brother, William, who was a birder, and the likes of John James Audubon, who instructed Baird on how to draw scientific illustrations of birds. His father was also a big influence on Baird's interest in nature, taking Baird on walks and gardening with him. He died of cholera when Baird was ten years old. As a young boy he attended Nottingham Academy in Port Deposit, Maryland and public school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Baird attended Dickinson College and earned his bachelor's and master's degrees, finishing the former in 1840. After graduation he moved to New York City with an interest in studying medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He returned to Carlisle two years later. He taught natural history at Dickinson starting in 1845. While at Dickinson, he did research, participated in collecting trips, did specimen exchanges with other naturalists, and traveled frequently. He married Mary Helen Churchill in 1846. In 1848, their daughter, Lucy Hunter Baird, was born. He was awarded a grant, in 1848, from the Smithsonian Institution to explore bone caves and the natural history of southeastern Pennsylvania. In 1849 he was given $75 by the Smithsonian Institution to collect, pack and transport specimens for them. It was during this time that he met Smithsonian Secretary Joseph Henry. The two would become close friends and colleagues. Throughout the 1840s Baird traveled extensively throughout the northeastern and central United States. Often traveling by foot, Baird hiked more than 2,100 miles in 1842 alone. Professional career =Starting at the Smithsonian= In 1850, Baird became the first curator at the Smithsonian Institution and the Permanent Secretary for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the latter which he served for three years. Upon his arrival in Washington, he brought two railroad box cars worth of his personal collection. Baird would create a museum program for the Smithstonian, requesting that the organization focus on natural history in the United States. His program also allowed him to create a network of collectors through an exchange system. He would ask that members of the Army and Navy collect rare animals and plant specimens from west of the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. In order to balance the collection, Baird sent duplicate specimens to other museums around the country, often exchanging the duplicates for specimens the Smithsonian needed. During the 1850s he described over 50 new species of reptiles, some by himself, and others with his student Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard.\\"Baird\\". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Their 1853 catalog of the Smithsonian's snake collection is a benchmark work in North American herpetology. Baird also was a mentor to herpetologist Robert Kennicott who died prematurely, at which point Baird left the field of herpetology to focus on larger projects.Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (\\"History of the Study of Snakes in the United States\\", pp. 11-16). Eventually, he became the Assistant Secretary, serving under Joseph Henry. As Assistant, Baird would help develop a publication and journal exchange, that provided scientists around the world with publications they would have a hard time accessing. He supported the work of William Stimpson, Robert Kennicott, Henry Ulke and Henry Bryant. Between his start as Assistant Secretary and 1855, he worked with Joseph Henry to provide scientific equipment and needs to the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. He received his Ph.D. in physical science in 1856 from Dickinson College. In 1857 and 1852 he acquired the collection of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science. However, the objects wouldn't join the permanent collection of the Smithsonian until 1858. Baird would attend the funeral of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, alongside Joseph Henry. In 1870, Baird was vacationing in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he developed an interest in maritime research. He would go on to lead expeditions in Nova Scotia and New England. =United States Fish Commission and United States National Museum= Baird with his wife and daughter in Wood's Hole, Massachusetts. It was at Wood's Hole that Baird would gain interest in ichthyology. On February 25, 1871, Ulysses S. Grant appointed Baird as the first Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries for the United States Fish Commission. He would serve in this position until his death. With Baird as Commissioner, the commission sought opportunities to restock rivers with salmon and lakes with other food fish and the depletion of food fish in coastal waters. Baird reported that humans were the reason for the decline of food fish in these coastal areas. Individuals with access to shoreline property used weirs, or nets, to capture large amounts of fish on the coast, which threatened the supply of fish on the coast. Baird used the U.S. Fish Commission to limit human impact through a compromise by prohibiting the capture of fish in traps from 6pm on Fridays until 6pm on Mondays.Anderson, Byron (2002). \\"Biographical Portrait: Spencer Fullerton Baird.\\" Forest History Today: 31-33.Allard, Dean C. (1984). \\"Spencer Fullerton Baird and the Foundations of American Marine Sciences\\". Annapolis, Maryland: U.S. Naval Historical Center. pp. 237-239. The Albatross research vessel would be launched during his tenure, in 1882. He was highly active in developing fishing and fishery policies for the United States, and was instrumental in making Wood's Hole the research venue it is today. Baird became the manager of the United States National Museum in 1872. Baird told George Perkins Marsh that he sought to be the director of the National Museum and that he had intentions to expand on the collections within the museum en masse. He was the primary writer of A History of North American Birds, which was published in 1874 and continues to be an important publication in ornithology today. He created all of the United States federal exhibits in the Centennial Exposition, many of which won awards. When the exposition ended, Baird was successful in persuading other exhibitors to contribute the objects from their exhibits to the Smithsonian. In total, Baird left with sixty-two boxcars filled with 4,000 cartons of objects. Owing to the large number of objects collected, in 1879, Congress approved construction for the first National Museum building, which is now the Arts and Industries Building. =Second Secretary at the Smithsonian= Joseph Henry died on May 13, 1878 and on May 17, Baird became the second Secretary of the Smithsonian. Baird was allowed to live, rent free, in the Smithsonian Institution Building, but declined and had the east wing converted into workspace. He also had telephones installed throughout the building. That year, he was made a member of the Order of St. Olav by the King of Sweden. In 1880 Baird was elected a member of the American Antiquarian SocietyAmerican Antiquarian Society Members Directory He oversaw the building of the new National Museum building, which opened in 1881. In September 1883, he was unanimously declared a founding member of the American Ornithologists' Union even though his duties prevented him from attending their first convention. During the February 1887, Baird went on leave due to \\"intellectual exertion\\". Samuel P. Langley would serve as Acting Secretary. Death and legacy Spencer Fullerton Baird died on August 19, 1887. Upon Baird's death, the Arts and Industries building was draped with a mourning cloth. John Wesley Powell spoke at Baird's funeral. Baird is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery. Baird's sparrow, a migratory bird native to Canada, Mexico and the United States, is named after him. A medium-sized shorebird known as Baird's sandpiper is also named after him. Baird Auditorium in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is named in his honor. It is located on the National Mall side of the first floor of the museum.http://naturalhistory.si.edu/visit/museum_map/floor_plans/index.html Baird's wife, Mary, donated his stamp collection to the National Museum. His papers are held in the Smithsonian Institution Archives. In 1946, Baird was one of four Smithsonian Secretaries featured in an exhibition about their lives and work curated by United States National Museum curator Theodore T. Belote. In 1922, the Baird Ornithological Club was founded and named after Baird.

Brandt encouraged the collection of native animals, many of which were not represented in the museum. Many specimens began to arrive from the expeditions of Severtzov, Przhevalsky, Middendorff, Schrenck and Gustav Radde. He described several birds collected by Russian explorers off the Pacific Coast of North America, including Brandt's cormorant, red-legged kittiwake and spectacled eider. As a paleontologist, Brandt ranks among the best. He was also an entomologist, specialising in Coleoptera (beetles) and Diplopoda (millipedes). He died in Merrek√ºll, Governorate of Estonia.

He was a close confidant of the Duke of Newcastle, Prime Minister between 1754 and 1756 and 1757 until 1762. Background A son of Philip Yorke, an attorney, he was born at Dover. Through his mother, Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Richard Gibbon of Rolvenden, Kent, he was connected with the family of Edward Gibbon the historian. He was educated at a school in Bethnal Green run by Samuel Morland, a nonconformist. At age 16 Yorke entered the attorney's office of Charles Salkeld in Holborn, London. He was entered at the Middle Temple in November 1708, and perhaps recommended by his employer to Lord Chief Justice Parker as law tutor to his sons. In 1715 Yorke was called to the bar, where his progress was, says Lord Campbell, more rapid than that of any other debutant in the annals of our profession, his advancement being greatly furthered by the patronage of Macclesfield, who became Lord Chancellor in 1718, when Yorke transferred his practice from the king's bench to the court of chancery, though he continued to go on the western circuit. In the following year he established his reputation as an equity lawyer in a case in which Robert Walpole's family was interested, by an argument displaying profound learning and research concerning the jurisdiction of the chancellor, on lines which he afterwards more fully developed in a celebrated letter to Lord Kames on the distinction between law and equity. Through Macclesfield's influence with the Duke of Newcastle Yorke entered parliament in 1719 as member for Lewes, and was appointed solicitor-general, with a knighthood, in 1720, although he was then a barrister of only four years standing. Philip Yorke married Margaret Cocks, by whom he had five sons and two daughters. Although in his youth he contributed to The Spectator over the signature Philip Homebred, he seems early to have abandoned all care for literature, and he has been reproached by Lord Campbell and others with his neglect of art and letters. On 16 May 1719 he married Margaret, daughter of Charles Cocks (by his wife Mary Cocks, sister of Lord Chancellor Somers) and widow of William Lygon (who died without issue in 1716), by whom he had five sons and two daughters: * Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston (1720‚Äì1790), who succeeded him * Hon. Charles Yorke (1722‚Äì1770), became, like his father, Lord Chancellor * Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1725‚Äì1760), married Lord Anson * Hon. Joseph Yorke (d. 1792), a diplomat, created Baron Dover * Hon. John Yorke (1728‚Äì1801), Member of Parliament for Reigate and Higham Ferrers * Hon. James Yorke (1730‚Äì1808), became Bishop of Ely * Lady Margaret Yorke, married Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Bt Wimpole Hall In 1739, he purchased Wimpole Hall, the greatest country house in Cambridgeshire. He is buried, with many of his descendants, at the St. Andrew Churchyard at Wimpole. Hardwicke was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Philip. His cousin Sir William Yorke, 1st Baronet had a highly successful career as a judge in Ireland, becoming Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. Career =Attorney-General= The prosecution of Christopher Layer for treason as a Jacobite raised Yorke's reputation as a forensic orator; and in 1723, having already become attorney-general, he passed through the House of Commons the bill of pains and penalties against Francis Atterbury. He was excused, on the ground of his personal friendship, from acting for the crown in the impeachment of Macclesfield in 1725; he soon found a new patron in the Duke of Newcastle. Lord Hardwicke is also remembered as one of the two authors of the Yorke‚ÄìTalbot slavery opinion whilst he was a crown law officer in 1729. The opinion was sought to determinate the legality of slavery and Hardwicke (then Philip Yorke) and Charles Talbot opined that it was legal. The opinion was disseminated and relied upon widely. Lord Hardwicke would subsequently endorse the views in the opinion in a judicial capacity in Pearne v Lisle (1749) Amb 75, 27 ER 47. He rendered valuable service to Walpole's government by his support of the bill for prohibiting loans to foreign powers (1730), of the increase of the army (1732) and of the excise bill (1733). =Walpole government= In 1733 Yorke was appointed lord chief justice of the king's bench, with the title of Lord Hardwicke, and was sworn of the privy council; and in 1737 he succeeded Lord Talbot as Lord Chancellor, thus becoming a member of Walpole's cabinet. One of his first official acts was to deprive the poet James Thomson of a small office conferred on him by Talbot. =House of Lords= Hardwicke's political importance was greatly increased by his move to the House of Lords, where the incompetency of Newcastle threw on the chancellor the duty of defending the measures of the government. He resisted Carteret's motion to reduce the army in 1738, and the resolutions hostile to Spain over the affair of Captain Jenkins's ears. But when Walpole bent before the storm and declared war against Spain, Hardwicke advocated energetic measures for its conduct; and he tried to keep the peace between Newcastle and Walpole. There is no sufficient ground for Horace Walpole's charge that the fall of Sir Robert was brought about by Hardwicke's treachery. =Wilmington government= No one was more surprised than himself when he retained the chancellorship in the following administration, and he resisted the proposal to indemnify witnesses against Walpole in one of his finest speeches in May 1742. He exercised a leading influence in the Wilmington Cabinet; and when Wilmington died in August 1743, it was Hardwicke who put forward Henry Pelham for the vacant office against the claims of Pulteney. For many years from this time he was the controlling power in the government. During the king's absences on the continent Hardwicke was left at the head of the council of regency; it thus fell to him to concert measures for dealing with the Jacobite rising in 1745. After Culloden he presided at the trial of the Scottish Jacobite peers, his conduct of which, though judicially impartial, was neither dignified nor generous; and he must be held partly responsible for the severity meted out to the rebels, and especially for the executions on obsolete attainders of Charles Radclyffe and (in 1753) of Archibald Cameron of Locheil. He carried out a major reform in 1746 which swept away the feudal power surviving in Scotland in the form of private heritable jurisdictions in the hands of the landed gentry. On the other hand, his legislation in 1748 for disarming the Highlanders and prohibiting the use of the tartan in their dress was vexatious without being effective. Hardwicke supported Chesterfield's reform of the calendar in 1751; in 1753 his bill for legalizing the naturalization of Jews in England had to be dropped on account of the popular clamour it excited; but he successfully carried a Marriage Act which became the basis of subsequent legislation. =Newcastle government= On the death of Pelham in 1754 Hardwicke obtained for Newcastle the post of prime minister, and for reward was created earl of Hardwicke and Viscount Royston; and when in November 1756 the weakness of the ministry and the threatening aspect of foreign affairs compelled Newcastle to resign, Hardwicke retired with him. He played a part in negotiating the coalition between Newcastle and Pitt in 1757, when he accepted a seat in Pitt's cabinet without returning to the woolsack. After the accession of George III Hardwicke opposed the ministry of Lord Bute on the peace with France in 1762, and on the cider tax in the following year. In the Wilkes case Hardwicke condemned general warrants, and also the doctrine that seditious libels published by members of parliament were protected by parliamentary privilege. He died in London on 6 March 1764. Influence In 1736 the King's Bench, under his presidency, delivered the seminal judgment in Middleton v. Crofts 2 Atk 650, which held that canons made in the provincial clergy convocations could not, by themselves, bind the lay faithful. He held the office of Lord Chancellor longer than any of his predecessors, with a single exception. His decisions fixed limits and established principles of Equity. His influence was powerful in obliterating the traditions of the judicial bench under the Stuart monarchy, and in establishing the modern conception of the duties and demeanour of English judges. While still at the bar Lord Chesterfield praised his conduct of crown prosecutions as a contrast to the former bloodhounds of the crown; and he described Sir Philip Yorke as naturally humane, moderate and decent.

He attended Utica Free Academy, a public high school, and then Harvard, where he graduated, magna cum laude, with a degree in modern literature and aesthetics in 1981.\\"Into the Inferno, with Notebook\\". \\"Writer Mark Danner is at his best when the world is at its worst\\", Harvard magazine, January‚ÄìFebruary 2005 At Harvard, he studied with Stanley Cavell, Robert Kiely, Stanley Hoffmann, and Frank Kermode, who in 1977-78 was the Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer and became Danner's mentor and friend. Career =Early years= After leaving Harvard, Danner joined the staff of The New York Review of Books, where he worked as an assistant to editor Robert B. Silvers from 1981 to 1984. In 1984, he moved to Harper's Magazine as a senior editor. In 1986, he joined The New York Times Magazine, where he specialized in foreign affairs and politics, writing pieces about nuclear weapons and about the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti, among other stories. =The New Yorker and El Mozote= In 1990, Danner joined the staff of The New Yorker shortly after the magazine published his three-part series on Haiti, \\"A Reporter at Large: Beyond the Mountains\\". On December 6, 1993, for only the second time in its history, The New Yorker devoted its entire issue to one article, Danner's piece, \\"The Truth of El Mozote\\", an investigation into the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, thought to be one of the worst atrocities in modern Latin American history. The Mozote article became the basis for Danner's first book, The Massacre at El Mozote: A Parable of the Cold War, which was published in 1994. The New York Times Book Review recognized The Massacre at El Mozote as one of its \\"Notable Books of the Year.\\"\\"Notable Books of the Year: 1994\\". \\"Notable Books of the Year: 1994\\", The New York Times, December 4, 1994 =The Balkans and The New York Review of Books= During the mid-1990s Danner began reporting on the wars in the Balkans, writing a series of eleven extended articles for The New York Review of Books, which began with Danner's cover piece, \\"The US and the Yugoslav Catastrophe\\" (November 20, 1997) and concluded with \\"Kosovo: The Meaning of Victory\\", (July 15, 1999).\\"Contributor - New York Review of Books\\". \\"Contributor - New York Review of Books\\", The New York Review of Books, December 7, 2018 His 16,000-word essay, \\"Marooned in the Cold War: America, the Alliance and the Quest for a Vanished World,\\" which appeared in World Policy Journal (Fall 1997) provoked a prolonged exchange of letters and responses from Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, and Ambassador George F. Kennan. =Iraq and the War on Terror= Danner began writing about the war on terror soon after September 11, 2001, publishing \\"The Battlefield in the American Mind\\" in The New York Times in October of that year. He began speaking out against invading Iraq, notably in a series of debates with Christopher Hitchens, Leon Wieseltier, Michael Ignatieff, David Frum, William Kristol and others.\\"The Great Debate\\" by Gary Kamiya, salon.com, January 30, 2003 He reported from Iraq for The New York Review of Books in a series of lengthy dispatches including \\"Iraq: How Not to Win a War\\" (September 25, 2003), \\"Delusions in Baghdad\\" (February 12, 2004), and \\"The War of the Imagination\\" (December 21, 2006). In May 2005 Danner wrote an essay for The New York Review accompanying the first American publication of the so-called \\"Downing Street Memo\\", the leaked minutes of a July 2002 meeting of high-level British officials that confirmed that when it came to the debate over whether to go to war in Iraq, \\"the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,\\" and that the invasion of Iraq was in fact a foregone conclusion. The essay provoked a number of responses and led to two subsequent essays, all of which were collected, along with relevant documents and a preface by The New York Times columnist Frank Rich, in 2006 in The Secret Way to War: the Downing Street Memo and the Iraq War's Buried History. In October 2016, Brian Lamb sat down with Mark Danner to talk about his latest book, Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War, which looks at the 15-year U.S. war on terrorism. The interviewed aired on C-SPAN on Oct. 27, 2016. =Torture and Abu Ghraib= Beginning in the spring of 2004, he wrote a series of essays for The New York Review of Books on the emerging torture scandal that came to be known as Abu Ghraib. In October 2004, he collected these essays and gathered them, together with a series of government documents and reports, into his book, Torture and Truth: America, Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror. In March 2009, Danner published an essay in The New York Review, \\"US Torture: Voices from the Black Sites\\", which revealed the contents of a secret International Committee of the Red Cross report based on testimony from \\"high-value detainees\\" in the \\"War on Terror,\\" who had been captured, held, and interrogated at secret US prisons‚Äîthe so-called \\"black sites\\". Shortly thereafter, he published a second essay, \\"The Red Cross Report: What it Means\\" and released the full text of the report on The New York Review website. Weeks later, President Obama ordered released four Justice Department memos in which the Bush administration purported \\"to legalize torture.\\" Senior Obama officials Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod claimed publicly that the memos' release was prompted by publication of the Red Cross Report.\\"Emanuel Addresses Torture Memos Politico.com =Mark Danner On Donald Trump= In the spring of 2016, Danner began covering the 2016 general election for The New York Review of Books, profiling then Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump on his campaign trail. In May, The New York Review of Books published \\"The Magic of Donald Trump,\\" and on Dec. 22, the magazine published \\"The Real Trump.\\" Following the articles, Danner has appeared as a guest on multiple radio shows, including WNUR 89.3FM Chicago's \\"This is Hell!\\" and KALW 91.5FM San Francisco's \\"Your Call\\", to discuss Trump's presidency. He also has sat down with Bard President Leon Botstein twice to discuss President Donald Trump's first days in office and his approach to foreign and domestic policy. In March 2017, The New York Review of Books published Danner's \\"What Could He Do?,\\" which chronicles Trump's first days in office.

He sat in the House of Commons as member for Reigate (1741‚Äì47), and afterwards for Cambridgeshire; he kept notes of the debates which were afterwards embodied in Cobbett's Parliamentary History. Wimpole Hall During the political crisis over the loss of Minorca to the French in 1756, Lord Royston was tapped with collecting favourable press accounts of the ministry. He joined his father, as well as Lord Mansfield, to defend the Newcastle ministry during the parliamentary inquiries following the execution of Admiral John Byng.M. John Cardwell, Arts and Arms: Literature, Politics and Patriotism During the Seven Years War, (Manchester University Press, 2004), 50-1. He was styled by the courtesy title Viscount Royston from 1754 to 1764, when he succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father. He inherited the Wimpole estate, Cambridgeshire which his father had bought from Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford. On the accession of George III in 1760, Yorke was sworn of the privy council. In politics he supported the Rockingham Whigs. He was Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire (1757 to his death) and high steward of Cambridge University. He edited a quantity of miscellaneous state papers and correspondence, to be found in manuscript collections in the British Museum. Between 1756 and 1760, he served in the honorary position of vice president of the Foundling Hospital, a charitable institution providing for London's abandoned children. He died in 1790 and was buried in Flitton, Bedfordshire with a monument by Thomas Banks.Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660-1851, Rupert Gunnis Works With his brother, Charles Yorke, he was one of the chief contributors to Athenian Letters; or the Epistolary Correspondence of an agent of the King of Persia residing at Athens during the Peloponnesian War (4 vols., London, 1741), a work that for many years had a considerable vogue and went through several editions. Marriage and children On 22 May 1740 he married Lady Jemima Campbell, only daughter of John Campbell, 3rd Earl of Breadalbane by his wife Lady Amabel de Grey, daughter and heiress of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent (1671-1740). On the death of her grandfather the Duke of Kent in 1740, Jemima succeeded him in her own right as the 2nd Marchioness Grey and 4th Baroness Lucas.

The parish is on the county boundary with Oxfordshire and the village is about southeast of the Oxfordshire market town of Bicester. History According to legend King Edward the Confessor gave some land to one of his men in return for slaying a wild boar that had infested the nearby Bernwood Forest. The man built himself a mansion on this land and called it \\"Boar-stall\\" (Old English for 'Boar House') in memory of the slain beast. The man, known as Neil, was also given a horn from the dead beast, and the legend says that whoever shall possess the horn shall be the lord of the manor of Boarstall. It is certainly the case from manorial records of 1265 that the owner of the manor of Boarstall was the ceremonial keeper of the Bernwood Forest, suggesting a link with the earlier legend. Given the proximity of Boarstall to the king's palace at Brill it would appear that this legend certainly has some basis in fact. The Magna Britannia of 1806 noted that the current incumbent of the manor, Sir John Aubrey, was in possession of a large horn > \\"of a dark brown colour, variegated and veined like tortoise-shell. It is > two feet four inches in length, on the convex bend, the diameter of the > larger end is three inches; at each end it is tipt with silver, gilt, and > has a wreath of leather, by which it is hung about the neck\\". The manor was fortified in 1312 by the construction of a defensive gatehouse. The house was demolished in 1778 but the gatehouse, very large and grand for its time, survives relatively unaltered. Boarstall Tower, which was originally part of the 18th century house on the site, was given to the National Trust by the philanthropist Ernest Cook, founder of the Ernest Cook Trust. In the English Civil War this was made into a garrison by King Charles I who was in possession of the nearby village of Brill. When Brill fell in 1643, so did the garrison at Boarstall. However whereas the manor at Brill was destroyed in the fighting, the fortified manor at Boarstall was saved, and used as a garrison by John Hampden's men, from which they were able to attack Royalist Oxford, away. Having no further use for the manor in 1644, Hampden left to go and fight elsewhere. The house was then taken back for the Royalists by Colonel Henry Gage, whom it is said launched such heavy fire from his cannons against the house that the incumbent Lady Denham was forced to evacuate and steal away in disguise. Gage left a small garrison in place to defend the house. In May 1645 the house was attacked again by the Parliamentarian forces, this time led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, but he was unsuccessful. The following year in 1646 Fairfax returned, and the house was surrendered to him on June 10, after a siege of 18 hours. Ecclesiastically, Boarstall was originally a chapel of ease for nearby Oakley, and its tithes were granted by Empress Matilda to St Frideswide's monastery in Oxford. The ecclesiastical parish of Boarstall was formed in 1418. The original parish church was mainly demolished in the English Civil War but a replacement was constructed out of funds provided by Lady Denham.

Background and education Wimpole Hall Shield of arms of Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke, KG, PC, FRS Born in Cambridge, England, he was the eldest son of Charles Yorke, Lord Chancellor, by his first wife, Catherine Freman. He was educated at Harrow and Queens' College, Cambridge. In 1790 he succeeded his uncle Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke to his earldom and estates, including Wimpole Hall. Political career Hardwicke was Member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire from 1780 to 1790, following the Whig traditions of his family, but after his succession to the earldom in 1790 he supported William Pitt The Younger, and took office in 1801 as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1801‚Äì1806), where he supported Catholic emancipation. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1801, created a Knight of the Garter in 1803, and was a fellow of the Royal Society. Family Lord Hardwicke married Lady Elizabeth, daughter of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres, in 1782. They had four sons and four daughters. Of the sons: *Philip Yorke, Viscount Royston (7 May 1784-04 Apr 1808), was Member of Parliament for Reigate but was lost at sea off L√ºbeck (having died without issue); *Charles was born 23 Aug 1787 and died Dec. 28, 1791; *Charles James Yorke, Viscount Royston (14 Jul 1797‚Äì30 Apr 1810), died at Wimpole of Scarlet Fever; and *Joseph John was born 12 Aug 1800 and died in March 1801.

Herman and Noam Chomsky to explain how propaganda and systemic biases function in corporate mass media. The model seeks to explain how populations are manipulated and how consent for economic, social, and political policies, both foreign and domestic, is \\"manufactured\\" in the public mind due to this propaganda. The theory posits that the way in which corporate media is structured (e.g. through advertising, concentration of media ownership, government sourcing) creates an inherent conflict of interest and therefore acts as propaganda for anti-democratic elements. First presented in their 1988 book Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, the propaganda model views corporate media as businesses interested in the sale of a product‚Äîreaders and audiences‚Äîto other businesses (advertisers) rather than the pursuit of quality journalism in service of the public. Describing the media's \\"societal purpose\\", Chomsky writes, \\"... the study of institutions and how they function must be scrupulously ignored, apart from fringe elements or a relatively obscure scholarly literature\\". The theory postulates five general classes of \\"filters\\" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media. These five classes are: ownership of the medium, the medium's funding sources, sourcing, flak, and anti-communism or \\"fear ideology\\". The first three are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. In versions published after the 9/11 attacks on the United States in 2001, Chomsky and Herman updated the fifth prong to instead refer to the \\"War on Terror\\" and \\"counter-terrorism\\", which they state operates in much the same manner. Although the model was based mainly on the media of the United States, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles that the model postulates as the cause of media biases. Their assessment has been confirmed by a number of scholars and the propaganda role of the media has since been empirically assessed in Western Europe and Latin America.  Filters  = Ownership = The size and profit-seeking imperative of dominant media corporations create a bias. The authors point to how in the early nineteenth century, a radical British press had emerged that addressed the concerns of workers, but excessive stamp duties, designed to restrict newspaper ownership to the 'respectable' wealthy, began to change the face of the press. Nevertheless, there remained a degree of diversity. In post World War II Britain, radical or worker-friendly newspapers such as the Daily Herald, News Chronicle, Sunday Citizen (all since failed or absorbed into other publications), and the Daily Mirror (at least until the late 1970s) regularly published articles questioning the capitalist system. The authors posit that these earlier radical papers were not constrained by corporate ownership and therefore, were free to criticize the capitalist system. A table of six big media conglomerates in 2014, including some of their subsidiaries. Herman and Chomsky argue that since mainstream media outlets are currently either large corporations or part of conglomerates (e.g. Westinghouse or General Electric), the information presented to the public will be biased with respect to these interests. Such conglomerates frequently extend beyond traditional media fields and thus have extensive financial interests that may be endangered when certain information is publicized. According to this reasoning, news items that most endanger the corporate financial interests of those who own the media will face the greatest bias and censorship. It then follows that if to maximize profit means sacrificing news objectivity, then the news sources that ultimately survive must be fundamentally biased, with regard to news in which they have a conflict of interest. = Advertising = The second filter of the propaganda model is funding generated through advertising. Most newspapers have to attract advertising in order to cover the costs of production; without it, they would have to increase the price of their newspaper. There is fierce competition throughout the media to attract advertisers; a newspaper which gets less advertising than its competitors is at a serious disadvantage. Lack of success in raising advertising revenue was another factor in the demise of the 'people's newspapers' of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The product is composed of the affluent readers who buy the newspaper‚Äîwho also comprise the educated decision-making sector of the population‚Äîwhile the actual clientele served by the newspaper includes the businesses that pay to advertise their goods. According to this filter, the news is \\"filler\\" to get privileged readers to see the advertisements which makes up the content and will thus take whatever form is most conducive to attracting educated decision-makers. Stories that conflict with their \\"buying mood\\", it is argued, will tend to be marginalized or excluded, along with information that presents a picture of the world that collides with advertisers' interests. The theory argues that the people buying the newspaper are the product which is sold to the businesses that buy advertising space; the news has only a marginal role as the product. = Sourcing = The third of Herman and Chomsky's five filters relates to the sourcing of mass media news: \\"The mass media are drawn into a symbiotic relationship with powerful sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest.\\" Even large media corporations such as the BBC cannot afford to place reporters everywhere. They concentrate their resources where news stories are likely to happen: the White House, the Pentagon, 10 Downing Street and other central news \\"terminals\\". Although British newspapers may occasionally complain about the \\"spin-doctoring\\" of New Labour, for example, they are dependent upon the pronouncements of \\"the Prime Minister's personal spokesperson\\" for government news. Business corporations and trade organizations are also trusted sources of stories considered newsworthy. Editors and journalists who offend these powerful news sources, perhaps by questioning the veracity or bias of the furnished material, can be threatened with the denial of access to their media life-blood - fresh news. Thus, the media has become reluctant to run articles that will harm corporate interests that provide them with the resources that they depend upon. This relationship also gives rise to a \\"moral division of labor\\", in which \\"officials have and give the facts\\" and \\"reporters merely get them\\". Journalists are then supposed to adopt an uncritical attitude that makes it possible for them to accept corporate values without experiencing cognitive dissonance. = Flak = The fourth filter is 'flak' (not to be confused with flack which means promoters or publicity agents), described by Herman and Chomsky as 'negative responses to a media statement or [TV or radio] program. It may take the form of letters, telegrams, phone calls, petitions, lawsuits, speeches and Bills before Congress and other modes of complaint, threat and punitive action'. Business organizations regularly come together to form flak machines. An example is the US-based Global Climate Coalition (GCC), comprising fossil fuel and automobile companies such as Exxon, Texaco and Ford. The GCC was started up by Burson-Marsteller, one of the world's largest public relations companies, to attack the credibility of climate scientists and 'scare stories' about global warming. For Chomsky and Herman \\"flak\\" refers to negative responses to a media statement or program. The term \\"flak\\" has been used to describe what Chomsky and Herman see as efforts to discredit organizations or individuals who disagree with or cast doubt on the prevailing assumptions which Chomsky and Herman view as favorable to established power (e.g., \\"The Establishment\\"). Unlike the first three \\"filtering\\" mechanisms‚Äîwhich are derived from analysis of market mechanisms‚Äîflak is characterized by concerted efforts to manage public information. =Anti-Communism and fear= The fifth and final news filter that Herman and Chomsky identified was 'anti-communism'. Manufacturing Consent was written during the Cold War. Chomsky updated the model as \\"fear\\", often as 'the enemy' or an 'evil dictator' such as Colonel Gaddafi, Paul Biya, Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, or Vladimir Putin. This is exemplified in British tabloid headlines of 'Smash Saddam!' and 'Clobba Slobba!'. The same is said to extend to mainstream reporting of environmentalists as 'eco-terrorists'. The Sunday Times ran a series of articles in 1999 accusing activists from the non- violent direct action group Reclaim The Streets of stocking up on CS gas and stun guns. Anti-ideologies exploit public fear and hatred of groups that pose a potential threat, either real, exaggerated or imagined. Communism once posed the primary threat according to the model. Communism and socialism were portrayed by their detractors as endangering freedoms of speech, movement, the press and so forth. They argue that such a portrayal was often used as a means to silence voices critical of elite interests. Chomsky argues that since the end of the Cold War (1991), anticommunism was replaced by the \\"War on Terror\\", as the major social control mechanism: \\"Anti-communism has receded as an ideological factor in the Western media, but it is not dead... The ‚Äòwar on terror‚Äô has provided a useful substitute for the Soviet Menace.\\" Following the events of September 11, 2001, some scholars agree that Islamophobia is replacing anti-communism as a new source of public fear.  Case examples  Following the theoretical exposition of the propaganda model, Manufacturing Consent contains a large section where the authors seek to test their hypotheses. If the propaganda model is right and the filters do influence media content, a particular form of bias would be expected‚Äîone that systematically favors corporate interests. They also looked at what they perceived as naturally occurring \\"historical control groups\\" where two events, similar in their properties but differing in the expected media attitude towards them, are contrasted using objective measures such as coverage of key events (measured in column inches) or editorials favoring a particular issue (measured in number). =Coverage of \\"enemy\\" countries= Examples of bias given by the authors include the failure of the media to question the legality of the Vietnam War while greatly emphasizing the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War as an act of aggression. Other biases include a propensity to emphasize violent acts such as genocide more in enemy or unfriendly countries such as Kosovo while ignoring greater genocide in allied countries such as the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. This bias is also said to exist in foreign elections, giving favorable media coverage to fraudulent elections in allied countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala, while unfavorable coverage is given to legitimate elections in enemy countries such as Nicaragua. A study found that in the lead up to the Iraq War, most sources were overwhelmingly in favor of the invasion. Chomsky also asserts that the media accurately covered events such as the Battle of Fallujah but because of an ideological bias, it acted as pro-government propaganda. In describing coverage of raid on Fallujah General Hospital he stated that The New York Times, \\"accurately recorded the battle of Fallujah but it was celebrated... it was a celebration of ongoing war crimes\\". The article in question was \\"Early Target of Offensive Is a Hospital\\". =Scandals of leaks= The authors point to biases that are based on only reporting scandals which benefit a section of power, while ignoring scandals that hurt the powerless. The biggest example of this was how the US media greatly covered the Watergate Scandal but ignored the COINTELPRO exposures. While the Watergate break-in was a political threat to powerful people (Democrats), COINTELPRO harmed average citizens and went as far as political assassination. Other examples include coverage of the Iran‚ÄìContra affair by only focusing on people in power such as Oliver North but omitting coverage of the civilians killed in Nicaragua as the result of aid to the contras. In a 2010 interview, Chomsky compared media coverage of the Afghan War Diaries released by WikiLeaks and lack of media coverage to a study of severe health problems in Fallujah. While there was ample coverage of WikiLeaks there was no American coverage of the Fallujah study, in which the health situation in Fallujah was described by the British media as \\"worse than Hiroshima\\".  Applications  Since the publication of Manufacturing Consent, Herman and Chomsky have adopted the theory and have given it a prominent role in their writings, lectures and theoretical frameworks. Chomsky has made extensive use of its explanative power to lend support to his interpretations of mainstream media attitudes towards a wide array of events, including the following: * Gulf War (1990), the media's failure to report on Saddam's peace offers. * Iraq invasion (2003), the media's failure to report on the legality of the warIllegal but Legitimate: a Dubious Doctrine for the Times. University of Washington. April 20, 2005. despite overwhelming public opinion in favor of only invading Iraq with UN authorization. According to the liberal watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting, there was a disproportionate focus on pro-war sources while total anti-war sources only made up 10% of the media (with only 3% of US sources being anti-war). * Global warming, the media gives near equal balance to people who deny climate changeJournalistic Balance as Global Warming Bias, FAIR despite only \\"about one percent\\" of climate scientists taking this view. Chomsky commented that there are \\"three sides\\" on climate change (deniers, those who follow the scientific consensus, and people who think that the consensus underestimates the threat from global warming), but in framing the debate the media usually ignore people who say that the scientific consensus is unduly optimistic. Reception On the rare occasions the propaganda model is discussed in the mainstream media there is usually a large reaction. In 1988, when Chomsky was interviewed by Bill Moyers there were 1,000 letters in response, one of the biggest written reactions in the show's history. When he was interviewed by TV Ontario, the show generated 31,321 call-ins, which was a new record for the station. In 1996, when Chomsky was interviewed by Andrew Marr the producer commented that the response was \\"astonishing\\". He commented that \\"[t]he audience reaction was astonishing... I have never worked on a programme which elicited so many letters and calls\\". In May 2007, Chomsky and Herman spoke at the University of Windsor in Canada summarizing developments and responding to criticisms related to the model.20 Years of Propaganda University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, May 2007 Both authors stated they felt the propaganda model is still applicable (Herman said even more so than when it was introduced), although they did suggest a few areas where they believe it falls short and needs to be extended in light of recent developments. Chomsky has insisted that while the propaganda role of the media \\"is intensified by ownership and advertising\\" the problem mostly lies with \\"ideological-doctrinal commitments that are part of intellectual life\\" or intellectual culture of the people in power. He compares the media to scholarly literature which he says has the same problems even without the constraints of the propaganda model.Chomsky In First Person, Frontline At the Windsor talk, Chomsky pointed out that Edward S. Herman was primarily responsible for creating the theory although Chomsky supported it. According to Chomsky, he insisted Herman's name appear first on the cover of Manufacturing Consent because of his primary role researching and developing the theory. =American pressure groups= With the emergence of the Internet as a cheap and potentially wide-ranging means of communication, a number of independent websites have surfaced which adopt the propaganda model to subject media to close scrutiny. Examples of these are Free Press and FAIR. =Harvard media torture study= In April 2010, a study conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School showed that media outlets such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times stopped using the term \\"torture\\" for waterboarding when the US government committed it, from 2002 to 2008. It also noted that the press was \\"much more likely to call waterboarding torture if a country other than the United States is the perpetrator.\\" The study was similar to media studies done in Manufacturing Consent for topics such as comparing how the term \\"genocide\\" is used in the media when referring to allied and enemy countries. Glenn Greenwald in response said that \\"We don‚Äôt need a state-run media because our media outlets volunteer for the task...\\" and commented that the media often act as propaganda for the government without coercion. =Studies of media outside the United States= Chomsky has commented in the \\"ChomskyChat Forum\\" on the applicability of the Propaganda Model to the media environment of other countries: > That's only rarely been done in any systematic way. There is work on the > British media, by a good U[niversity] of Glasgow media group. And > interesting work on British Central America coverage by Mark Curtis in his > book Ambiguities of Power. There is work on France, done in Belgium mostly, > also a recent book by Serge Halimi (editor of Le Monde diplomatique). There > is one very careful study by a Dutch graduate student, applying the methods > Ed Herman used in studying US media reaction to elections (El Salvador, > Nicaragua) to 14 major European newspapers. ... Interesting results. > Discussed a bit (along with some others) in a footnote in chapter 5 of my > book \\"Deterring Democracy,\\" if you happen to have that around. For more than a decade, a British-based website Media Lens has examined their domestic broadcasters and liberal press. Its criticisms are featured in the books Guardians of Power (2006) and Newspeak in the 21st Century (2009). Studies have also expanded the propaganda model to examine news media in the People's Republic of China and for film production in Hollywood. News of the World In July 2011, the journalist Paul Mason, then working for the BBC, pointed out that the News International phone hacking scandal threw light on close links between the press and politicians. However, he argued that the closure of the mass-circulation newspaper News of the World, which took place after the scandal broke, conformed only partly to the propaganda model. He drew attention to the role of social media, saying that \\"large corporations pulled their advertising\\" because of the \\"scale of the social media response\\" (a response which was mainly to do with the newspaper's behaviour towards Milly Dowler, although Mason did not go into this level of detail).\\"Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy\\", BBC. Mason praised The Guardian for having told the truth about the phone-hacking, but expressed doubt about the financial viability of the newspaper. > One part of the Chomsky doctrine has been proven by exception. He stated > that newspapers that told the truth could not make money. The Guardian...is > indeed burning money and may run out of it in three years' time. Criticism = The Anti-Chomsky Reader = Eli Lehrer of the American Enterprise Institute criticized the theory in The Anti-Chomsky Reader. According to Lehrer, the fact that papers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have disagreements is evidence that the media is not a monolithic entity. Lehrer also believes that the media cannot have a corporate bias because it reports on and exposes corporate corruption. Lehrer asserts that the model amounts to a Marxist conception of right-wing false consciousness. Herman and Chomsky have asserted that the media \\"is not a solid monolith\\" but that it represents a debate between powerful interests while ignoring perspectives that challenge the \\"fundamental premises\\" of all these interests. For instance, during the Vietnam War there was disagreement among the media over tactics, but the broader issue of the legality and legitimacy of the war was ignored (see Coverage of \\"enemy\\" countries). Additionally, Chomsky has said that while the media are against corruption, they are not against society legally empowering corporate interests which is a reflection of the powerful interests that the model would predict. Chomsky \\"Media\\" interview by Andrew Marr The Big Idea, 1996 The authors have also said that the model does not seek to address \\"the effects of the media on the public\\" which might be ineffective at shaping public opinion. Edward Herman has said \\"critics failed to comprehend that the propaganda model is about how the media work, not how effective they are\\".\\"The Propaganda Model: A Retrospective \\" Edward Herman =Inroads: A Journal of Opinion= Gareth Morley argues in an article in Inroads: A Journal of Opinion that widespread coverage of Israeli mistreatment of protesters as compared with little coverage of similar (or much worse) events in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly explained. This was in response to Chomsky's assertion that in testing the Model, examples should be carefully paired to control reasons for discrepancies not related to political bias. Chomsky himself cites the examples of government mis-treatment of protesters and points out that general coverage of the two areas compared should be similar, raising the point that they are not: news from Israel (in any form) is far more common than news from sub-Saharan Africa. Morley considers this approach dubiously empirical. =The New York Times review= Writing for The New York Times, the historian Walter LaFeber criticized the book Manufacturing Consent for overstating its case, in particular with regards to reporting on Nicaragua and not adequately explaining how a powerful propaganda system would let military aid to the Contra rebels be blocked. Herman responded in a letter by stating that the system was not \\"all powerful\\" and that LaFeber did not address their main point regarding Nicaragua. LaFeber replied that: > Mr. Herman wants to have it both ways: to claim that leading American > journals \\"mobilize bias\\" but object when I cite crucial examples that weaken > the book's thesis. If the news media are so unqualifiedly bad, the book > should at least explain why so many publications (including my own) can cite > their stories to attack President Reagan's Central American policy. Chomsky responds to LaFeber's reply in Necessary Illusions: > What is more, a propaganda model is not weakened by the discovery that with > careful and critical reading, material could be unearthed in the media that > could be used by those that objected to \\"President Reagan's Central American > policy\\" on grounds of principle, opposing not its failures but its > successes: the near destruction of Nicaragua and the blunting of the popular > forces that threatened to bring democracy and social reform to El Salvador, > among other achievements.

The man built himself a mansion on this land and called it \\"Boar-stall\\" (Old English for 'Boar House') in memory of the slain beast. The man, known as Neil, was also given a horn from the dead beast, and the legend says that whoever shall possess the horn shall be the lord of the manor of Boarstall. It is certainly the case from manorial records of 1265 that the owner of the manor of Boarstall was the ceremonial keeper of the Bernwood Forest, suggesting a link with the earlier legend. Given the proximity of Boarstall to the king's palace at Brill it would appear that this legend certainly has some basis in fact. The Magna Britannia of 1806 noted that the current incumbent of the manor, Sir John Aubrey, was in possession of a large horn > \\"of a dark brown colour, variegated and veined like tortoise-shell. It is > two feet four inches in length, on the convex bend, the diameter of the > larger end is three inches; at each end it is tipt with silver, gilt, and > has a wreath of leather, by which it is hung about the neck\\". The manor was fortified in 1312 by the construction of a defensive gatehouse. The house was demolished in 1778 but the gatehouse, very large and grand for its time, survives relatively unaltered. Boarstall Tower, which was originally part of the 18th century house on the site, was given to the National Trust by the philanthropist Ernest Cook, founder of the Ernest Cook Trust. In the English Civil War this was made into a garrison by King Charles I who was in possession of the nearby village of Brill. When Brill fell in 1643, so did the garrison at Boarstall. However whereas the manor at Brill was destroyed in the fighting, the fortified manor at Boarstall was saved, and used as a garrison by John Hampden's men, from which they were able to attack Royalist Oxford, away. Having no further use for the manor in 1644, Hampden left to go and fight elsewhere. The house was then taken back for the Royalists by Colonel Henry Gage, whom it is said launched such heavy fire from his cannons against the house that the incumbent Lady Denham was forced to evacuate and steal away in disguise. Gage left a small garrison in place to defend the house. In May 1645 the house was attacked again by the Parliamentarian forces, this time led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, but he was unsuccessful. The following year in 1646 Fairfax returned, and the house was surrendered to him on 10 June, after a siege of 18 hours.

It is thought to have been set aside as Royal hunting land when the Anglo-Saxon kings had a palace at Brill and church in Oakley, in the 10th century and was a particularly favoured place of Edward the Confessor, who was born in nearby Islip. From about 1217 through to the 17th century the forest went through a gradual period of deforestation. King Henry II (reigned 1154‚Äì1189) prepared a map of the forest at the time which is an invaluable tool in helping define its ancient boundaries; however, his purpose for drawing up the map was to divide the forest amongst his nobles. By the 16th century, another map of the forest had been drawn up by which time it had been reduced greatly in size. Again, the map was drawn up under the aegis of the Crown as an audit to what revenue could be made from selling off the forest. By the reign of King James I (reigned 1603‚Äì1625), the forest had lost its Royal status and had completely disappeared. Today the name refers to the area of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire where the forest was at the time of King Henry II, covering 400 km¬≤. The approximate boundaries of the designated area today fall within the River Great Ouse, the Padbury Brook, the Claydon Brook and the River Thame. The small modern Bernwood Forest in Buckinghamshire is approximately 1 km¬≤ and is contiguous with Hell Coppice, York's Wood, Oakley Wood and Shabbington Wood.Google Maps over-labels the nearby Waterperry Woods as Bernwood Forest. The accurate view is represented by the Ordnance Survey maps (OS maps) displayed by Streetmap, which groups Oakley Wood, Shabbington Wood, York's Wood and Hell Coppice as Bernwood Forest. A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Shabbington Woods Complex, it supports a wide variety of wildlife and is one of the most important butterfly sites in the United Kingdom. Its owners, the Forestry Commission,Forestry Commission information originally had a more commercial approach. Aerial spraying of pesticides occurring up until the late 1960s:Haugh Wood history firstly DDT to control Hylobius abietis then 2,4,5-T to clear broad-leafed plants (including oak saplings) before planting commercial pine stands. Holly Wood, Holton Wood, Stanton Great Wood and Waterperry Wood, all in Oxfordshire, and Ham Home-cum- Hamgreen Woods in Buckinghamshire, are also remnants of Bernwood Forest which are SSSIs. Another fragment in Buckinghamshire is Rushbeds Wood, an SSSI which is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.

Research methods Wallraff came to prominence thanks to his striking journalistic research methods and several major books on lower class working conditions and tabloid journalism. This style of research is based on what the reporter experiences personally after covertly becoming part of the subgroup under investigation. Wallraff would construct a fictional identity so that he was not recognisable as a journalist. Undercover work Wallraff invoked his constitutional right of conscientious objection to conscription in Germany into armed military service, thus being required to carry out alternative civilian service. Having missed the deadline for filing his refusal, he was nevertheless drafted into the Bundeswehr. Wallraff first took up this kind of investigative journalism in 1969 when he published 13 unerw√ºnschte Reportagen (\\"13 undesired reports\\") in which he described what he experienced when acting the parts of an alcoholic, a homeless person, and a worker in a chemicals factory. He travelled to Greece in May 1974 at the time of the Ioannides military dictatorship. While in Syntagma Square, he protested against human right violations. He was arrested and tortured by the police as he purposely did not carry on him any papers that could identify him as a foreigner. After his identity was revealed, Wallraff was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in jail. He was released in August, after the end of the dictatorship.Biography of G√ºnther Wallraff In 1977 Wallraff worked for four months as an editor for the tabloid Bild-Zeitung newspaper in Hanover, calling himself \\"Hans Esser\\". In his books Der Aufmacher (a pun meaning both \\"Lead Story\\" and \\"the one who opens\\") and Zeugen der Anklage (\\"Witnesses for the Prosecution\\") he portrays his experiences on the editorial staff of the paper and the journalism which he encountered there, which at times displayed contempt for humanity. In 1987 the journalist Hermann L. Gremliza claimed that he, rather than Wallraff, had written parts of Der Aufmacher. The book also formed the basis for the English-language film The Man Inside from 1990, starring J√ºrgen Prochnow as Wallraff. Ganz unten (\\"Lowest of the Low\\") (1985) documented Wallraff's posing as a Turkish \\"Gastarbeiter\\", and the mistreatment he received in that role at the hands of employers, landlords and the German government. In 1986 he was awarded Laureate of the International Botev Prize. In January 2003, Russia turned away Wallraff and two other Germans, the former labour minister for the CDU Norbert Bl√ºm and Rupert Neudeck, head of the relief organisation Cap Anamur, as they tried to enter the country to work on a human rights article about Chechnya. In May 2007, Wallraff announced that he had started yet another undercover journalist work, this time at a German call centre. During 2009 he wore blackface around Germany in an undercover story to expose latent or explicit racism against black men, releasing the documentary Black on White to show his experiences. Wallraff was criticized by some for this work, such as a suggestion that Wallraff was only interested in earning money from his investigations, or that the method itself was racist.\\"G√ºnter Wallraff:'Es geht nicht um Schwarze. Es geht um Wei√üe'\\" His investigative methods have led to the creation of the Swedish verb 'wallraffa' meaning \\"to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role\\". The word is currently included in the dictionary Svenska Akademiens Ordlista. Responses and repercussions Wallraff in 1985 Wallraff has been heavily criticised by those on the receiving end of his style of investigation, via attempts to frame his work as breaching privacy rights or revealing trade secrets. Attempts were made on a number of occasions to legally prevent Wallraff's investigative methods, but his actions were regularly ruled constitutional by the courts. The courts opined that freedom of the press and public interest in areas concerned with the formation of public opinion favoured Wallraff's actions. In balancing public interest with the competing interests of those immediately affected by his actions it follows however that private conversations, for example, may not be published. In September 2003, investigations were made by the Stasi Records Agency into the Rosenholz files on Stasi workers which somehow got into the hands of the CIA; as a result, it was claimed that Wallraff had had connections to the Stasi in the 1960s. Wallraff disputes that he ever actively worked for them. On 17 December 2004, the Hamburg district court ruled on a suit brought by Wallraff that he must not be described as an Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter or Stasi collaborator (he was being called this above all in newspapers belonging to the Axel Springer Verlag, the publishers of Bild) as no proof of collaboration could be furnished in the documents which had been presented.

It is simultaneously an inquiry into the nature and essence of photography and a eulogy to Barthes' late mother. The book investigates the effects of photography on the spectator (as distinct from the photographer, and also from the object photographed, which Barthes calls the \\"spectrum\\"). In a deeply personal discussion of the lasting emotional effect of certain photographs, Barthes considers photography as asymbolic, irreducible to the codes of language or culture, acting on the body as much as on the mind. The book develops the twin concepts of studium and punctum: studium denoting the cultural, linguistic, and political interpretation of a photograph, punctum denoting the wounding, personally touching detail which establishes a direct relationship with the object or person within it. Context Camera Lucida, along with Susan Sontag's On Photography, was one of the most important early academic books of criticism and theorization on photography. Neither writer was a photographer, however, and both works have been much criticised since the 1990s. Nevertheless, it was by no means Barthes' earliest approach to the subject. Barthes mentions photography in one of his 'little mythologies'‚Äîarticles published in the journal Les Lettres Nouvelles starting in 1954 and gathered in Mythologies, published untranslated in 1957. The article \\"Photography and Electoral Appeal\\" is more obviously political than Camera Lucida. In the 1960s and entering the next decade, Barthes' analysis of photography develops more detail and insight through a structuralist approach; Mythologies 's treatment of photography is by comparison tangential and simple. There is still in this structural phase a strong political impulse and background to his theorizing of photography; Barthes connects photography's ability to represent without style (a 'perfect analagon': \\"The Photographic Message\\", 1961) to its tendency to naturalise what are in fact invented and highly structured meanings. His examples deal with press photographs and advertising, which make good use of this property (or bad use of it, as the case may be). Published two months prior to his death in 1980, Camera Lucida is Barthes' first and only book devoted to photography. By now his tactics in writing, always shifting and complex, favouring the dialectical to the morally or politically 'committed' (Sartre), had once again changed. If sentimentality can be seen as a tactic in the late career of Roland Barthes, then Camera Lucida belongs to such an approach. It is novelistic, in line with the developments towards this new type of writing which Barthes had shown with A Lover's Discourse and Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes. However, the ideas about photography in Camera Lucida are certainly prepared in essays like \\"The Photographic Message\\", \\"Rhetoric of the Image\\" (1964), and \\"The Third Meaning\\" (1971). There is a movement through these three pieces of which Camera Lucida can be seen as the culmination. With \\"The Third Meaning\\" there is the suggestion that the photograph's reality, aside from all the messages it can be loaded with, might constitute an avant-garde value: not a message as such, aimed at the viewer/reader, but another kind of meaning that arises almost accidentally yet without being simply 'the material' or 'the accidental'; this is the eponymous third meaning. This essay of 1970, ostensibly about some Eisenstein stills, anticipates many of Camera Lucida's ideas and connects them back to still earlier ones. One could almost swap the term third meaning for the punctum of Camera Lucida. Yet the personal note of pain in Camera Lucida is not present in these earlier writings and is unmistakable. Written after his mother's death, Camera Lucida is as much a reflection on death as it is on photography. Barthes died in an automobile accident soon after the publication of Camera Lucida, and many have read the book as Barthes' eulogy for himself. Further reading * Barthes, Roland.

The name comes from the Odra river that flows through the city of Wroc≈Çaw. Overview The production started in 1959‚Äì1960. Models 1001, 1002, 1003, 1013, 1103, 1204 were of original Polish construction. Models 1304 and 1305 were functional counterparts of ICL 1905 and 1906 due to software agreement. The last model was 1325 based on two models by ICL. The computers were built at the Elwro manufacturing plant, which was closed in 1989. Odra 1002 was capable of only 100‚Äì400 operations per second. In 1962, Witold Podg√≥rski, an employee of Elwro, managed to create a computer game on a prototype of Odra 1003; it was an adaptation of a variant of Nim, as depicted in the film Last Year at Marienbad. The computer could play a perfect game and was guaranteed to win. The game was never distributed outside of the Elwro company, but its versions appeared elsewhere. It was probably the first Polish computer game in history. The operating system used by the Odra 1204 is called SODA. It was designed to work on a small computer without magnetic storage and can run simultaneous loading and execution of programs. An Odra 1204 computer was used by a team in Leningrad developing an ALGOL 68 compiler in 1976. The Odra 1204 ran the syntax analysis, code generation ran on an IBM System/360. retrieved Wed Jun 22 07:18:41 EST 2011 Up until 30 April 2010 there was still one Odra 1305 working at the railway station in Wroc≈Çaw Broch√≥w. The system was shut down at 22:00 CEST and replaced with a contemporary computer system. The Museum of the History of Computers and Information Technology (Muzeum Historii Komputer√≥w i Informatyki) in Katowice, Poland started a project to recommission an Odra 1305 in 2017.

Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot, (168514 February 1737) was a British lawyer and politician. He was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1733 to 1737. Life Talbot was the eldest son of William Talbot, Bishop of Durham, a descendant of the 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. He was educated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford, and became a fellow of All Souls College in 1704. He was called to the bar in 1711, and in 1717 was appointed solicitor general to the prince of Wales. Having been elected a member of the House of Commons in 1720, he became Solicitor General in 1726, and in 1733 he was made Lord Chancellor and raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Talbot, Baron of Hensol, in the County of Glamorgan. Talbot proved himself a capable equity judge during the three years of his occupancy of the Woolsack. Among his contemporaries he enjoyed the reputation of a wit; he was a patron of the poet James Thomson, who in The Seasons commemorated a son of his to whom he acted as tutor; Joseph Butler dedicated his famous Analogy to Talbot, as was Upton's edition of Epictetus. The title he assumed derived from the Hensol estate in Pendoylan, Glamorgan, which came to him through his wife. After an illness during which the King and Queen enquired after his health every day, Talbot died on 14February 1737 at his home in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Talbot is remembered as one of the authors of the Yorke‚ÄìTalbot slavery opinion, as a crown law officer in 1729. The opinion was sought to determinate the legality of slavery: Talbot and Philip Yorke opined that it was legal. The opinion was relied upon widely before the decision of Lord Mansfield in Somersett's Case. Family The tomb of Cecil Talbot, n√©e Matthew. Talbot married, in the summer of 1708, Cecil Mathew (died 1720), daughter of Charles Mathew of Castell y Mynach, Glamorganshire, and granddaughter and heiress of David Jenkins of Hensol. There he built a mansion in the Tudor style, known as the Castle. They had five sons, of whom three survived him: *Hon. John (died 22 Sep 1756) *William (16 May 171027 Apr 1782) *Rev. Hon. George (died 19 November 1782), who married the Hon. Anne Bouverie, daughter of Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone. They had four children, but only their sons lived to adulthood one of which was the Ver. Rev. Charles Talbot. He was succeeded in the title by his second son, William (1710‚Äì1782).

Originally composed as the national anthem for the short- lived West Indies Federation (1958‚Äì1962), this song was edited and adopted by Trinidad and Tobago when it became independent in 1962. Patrick S. Castagne composed the words and music of the National Anthem in 1962. Mr Castagne, a renowned West Indian songwriter, was employed at the Trinidad and Tobago Commission in London. One of his compositions, called \\"A Song for the Islands\\" or A Song for Federation, was submitted to the West Indies Federation as a possible anthem. When the Federation collapsed, he changed some of the lines and resubmitted the song to Trinidad and Tobago for the competition to choose the National Anthem. In total, the competition received 834 word only entries, 33 music only entries and 306 word and music entries. Mr. Castagne's submission came out on top and he won the prize of $5,000.00 in Government Bonds and a gold medal inscribed with the Coat of Arms of Trinidad and Tobago. Castagne's alteration of A Song for Federation was deemed to be most suitable for a twin-island state that consisted of \\"islands of the blue Caribbean Sea\\" standing \\"side by side\\" in promoting the values of \\"every creed and race\\" finding \\"an equal place\\" in the multi-racial, multi-religious and multi- cultural society of Trinidad and Tobago as it existed in 1962. It was considered to have reflected the nature and the strength of the people of Trinidad and Tobago and their courage as one nation working towards living in unity despite the existing diversity. According to an excerpt from the editorial in the Sunday Guardian of 19 August 1962: \\"In its solemn declaration of brotherhood and unity, it very neatly includes Tobago with Trinidad without mentioning the name of either (\\"Side by side we stand, islands of the blue Caribbean Sea\\"); and as an added impulse to unity it goes on to describe them together as \\"our native land,\\" ending with the petition, \\"And may God bless our nation.\\" Lyrics Words and music by Patrick Castagne (1916‚Äì2000). :Forged from the love of liberty :In the fires of hope and prayer :With boundless faith in our destiny :We solemnly declare: :Side by side we stand :Islands of the blue Caribbean sea, :This our native land :We pledge our lives to thee. :Here every creed and race find an equal place, :And may God bless our nation :Here every creed and race find an equal place, :And may God bless our nation. Lyrics for A Song for Federation Castagne's A Song For Federation provided the musical inspiration that could have matched the foundation of a strong federation had it survived. The close resemblance between the National Anthem of Trinidad and Tobago and A Song For Federation can seen from the lyrics of the latter as follows: : Forged from the love of unity : In the fires of hope and prayer : With boundless faith in our destiny : West Indians all declare: : Side by side we stand : With our hearts joined across the sea : This our native land : We pledge ourselves for thee. : Here every creed and race find an equal place, : And may God bless our nation : Here every creed and race find an equal place, : And may God bless our nation.

As a result of the CoCom embargo, computers could not be imported on a large scale from Western Bloc. Soviet Bloc manufacturers created copies of Western designs based on intelligence gathering and reverse engineering. This redevelopment led to some incompatibilities with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and IEEE standards, such as spacing integrated circuit pins at of a 25 mm length (colloquially a \\"metric inch\\") instead of a standard inch of 25.4 mm. This made Soviet chips unsellable on the world market outside the Comecon, and made test machinery more expensive.Fred Langa, \\"An Editor's View\\" sidebar to \\"Computing in the U.S.S.R.\\", April 1991 BYTE Magazine, page 129 History ES-1040 mainframe in Dresden, East Germany By the end of the 1950s most COMECON countries had developed experimental computer designs, yet none of them had managed to create a stable computer industry. In October 1962 the \\"Commission for Scientific Problems in Computing\\" (–ö–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏—è –ù–∞—É—á–Ω—ã–µ –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –í—ã—á–∏—Å–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫–∏, –ö–ù–í–í–¢) was founded in Warsaw and modelled after the International Federation for Information Processing.Bl. Sendov, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences: First Decade on Scientific Cooperation between the Socialist Countries in Computing, 8th IT STAR Workshop on History of Computing.Hans Dieter Hellige (ed.): Geschichten der Informatik. Visionen, Paradigmen, Leitmotive. Berlin, Springer 2004, . p. 267. Computer design and production began to be coordinated between the Comecon countries in 1964, when the Edinaya Sistema mainframe (Unified System, ES, also known as RIAD) was introduced. The project also included plans for the development of a joint Comecon computer network. Each COMECON country was given a role in the development of the ES: Hungary was responsible for software development, while East Germany improved the design of disk storage devices. The ES-1040 was successfully exported to countries outside the Comecon, including India, Yugoslavia and China. Each country specialized in a model of the ES series: R-10 in the case of Hungary, R-20 in Bulgaria, R-20A in Czechoslovakia, R-30 in Poland and R-40 in East Germany. Nairi-3, developed at the Armenian Institute for Computers, was the first third-generation computer in the Comecon area, using integrated circuits. Development on the Nairi system began in 1964, and it went into serial production in 1969. In 1969 the Intergovernmental Commission for Computer Technology was founded to coordinate computer production. Other cooperation initiatives included the establishment of joint Comecon development facilities in Moscow and Kiev. The R-300 computer, released in 1969, demonstrated the technical and managerial skills of VEB Robotron, and established a leading role for East Germany in the joint development efforts. The relative success of Robotron was attributed to its greater organizational freedom, and the profit motive of securing export orders. In 1970, Cuba produced its first digital computer, the CID-201. By 1972 the Comecon countries had produced around 7,500 computers, compared to 120,000 in the rest of the world. The USSR, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania had all set up computer production and research institutes. Collaboration between Romania and the other countries was limited, due to the autarkic policies of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. The availability of western computing hardware differed considerably between communist countries; in the early 1970s they were most common in Czechoslovakia, where a licensing agreement was signed with the French Groupe Bull. Non-Soviet Eastern European countries had more access to Western technology, which allowed them to manufacture more sophisticated computer equipment. In 1983 the representatives of the national academies of sciences of the Comecon countries met in Sofia to discuss the development of a new generation of computer systems. In June 1985 the ‚ÄúConception of a new generation of computer systems‚Äù was approved in Prague, with the objective of creating a socialist response to the Japanese fifth generation computer initiative. The document planned the development of the IT industry in socialist countries up to the year 2010. In 1985 Ukrainian researchers managed to reverse-engineer the ZX Spectrum chip and built a hardware clone using readily available parts. Over 50 different versions of the Spectrum were created in Soviet Bloc countries over the next few years, including the Hobbit, Baltica, Pentagon, Scorpion, Leningrad, Didaktik (Czechoslovakia), Spectral (East Germany) and Cobra (Romania). Pravetz computer In 1985 the computer industry of Bulgaria exported computer hardware to over 20 countries, manufacturing personal computers, word processing terminals and memory tapes and disks. At its peak, the country provided 40% of computers in the Comecon area. After the collapse of Comecon in 1989, the computer hardware sector in its former member countries could not compete with foreign manufacturers, and virtually disappeared. Tens of thousands of IT scientists and engineers migrated to Western Europe for employment, not always in fields related to their expertise.

The objective of the project, which was also known as Ryad ('series'), was to create a general purpose computer for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Initially announced as a Soviet venture in 1967, in 1969 it became an international project, involving Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland. Romania and Cuba joined the project in 1973. The first models entered serial production in 1972. According to CIA sources, by 1975 the Comecon countries had managed to build only 10% to 15% of the anticipated number of ES computers. Production continued until 1995. The total number of ES EVM mainframes produced was more than 15,000. In the period from 1986 to 1997, a series of PC-compatible desktop computers, called –ü–≠–í–ú –ï–° –≠–í–ú (Personal Computers of ES EVM series), was also produced; the newer versions of these computers are still produced under a different name on a very limited scale in Minsk.  Small Machines System project  SM EVM (–°–ú –≠–í–ú, –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ –ú–∞–ª—ã—Ö –≠–í–ú, meaning \\"System of Small Electronic Computers\\") was an intergovernmental program for creating minicomputers, run by the Ministry of Instrument Making. The program initially included two major architectural lines based on DEC PDP-11 architecture and HP 2100 architecture. Later the program included a family of DEC VAX compatible computers and Multibus based microcomputers. Minicomputers developed within the framework of the program were intended for use as computer based control systems, measuring and computing systems and workstations for CAD systems. As in the case of ES EVM, the program began as a Soviet venture and in 1974 became an international project involving Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania.  TPA  TPA (T√°rolt Program√∫ Analiz√°tor, meaning \\"Programmed Data Processor\\") was a Hungarian product line of computers. It could not be referred as a computer, though, as computers were meant to be produced by the Soviet Union. The project started based on the freely available manuals of DEC PDP-8 in 1966 and products made available in 1968. TPAs were 100% software compatible with their original counterparts. The project remained highly popular for about 25 years. PDP-11 compatible TPAs appeared in 1976, VAX-11 compatibles in 1983. Due to CoCom restrictions 32 bit computers could not be exported to the eastern bloc. In practice 32-bit DEC computes and processors were available. Those were rebranded as TPA.

He was the husband of actress Peggy Moran. Early life Koster was born to Jewish parents in Berlin, Germany. He was introduced to cinema about 1910 when his uncle opened a very early movie theater in Berlin. Koster's mother played the piano to accompany the films, leaving the young boy to occupy himself by watching the films. After working initially as a short story writer, Kosterlitz was subsequently hired by a Berlin movie company as scenarist, became assistant to director Curtis Bernhardt. Bernhardt became sick one day and asked Kosterlitz to take over as director. Career In 1932, Koster directed his first film in Berlin, the comedy Thea Roland. Koster, who was in the midst of directing his second film Das h√§√üliche M√§dchen, had already been the subject of antisemitism, and knew he had to leave. He lost his temper at an SA officer at his bank during lunch hour, and knocked the officer out. When the film, written by Koster with Felix Joachimson, had its premiere in autumn 1933 their names were deleted and both went into exile. Koster left Germany for France, where he was rehired by Bernhardt (who had left earlier). Eventually Koster went to Budapest and met and married Kat√≥ Kir√°ly in 1934. In Budapest he met Joe Pasternak again, who represented Universal in Europe, and directed three films for him. One of those films was Catherine the Last after a script by Joachimson and K√°roly N√≥ti that was remade in 1938 by Norman Taurog as The Girl Downstairs both versions starring Franciska Gaal. In 1936 Koster got a contract to work with Universal Pictures in Hollywood, and he travelled to the United States to work with Pasternak, other refugees and his wife. Although Koster did not speak English, he convinced the studio to let him make Three Smart Girls, for which he personally coached 14-year-old star Deanna Durbin. This picture, a big success, pulled Universal out of bankruptcy. Koster's second Universal film, One Hundred Men and a Girl, with Durbin and Leopold Stokowski put the studio, Durbin, Pasternak, and Koster on top. Koster discovered Abbott and Costello working at a nightclub in New York. He returned to Hollywood and convinced Universal to hire them. Their first picture, which featured the Who's On First? routine, was One Night in the Tropics. The female lead, Peggy Moran, would become Koster's second wife in 1942. When he married Moran, Koster promised her he would put her in every movie he made from then on. He did, but it was her statue. Usually it is a sculptured head on a mantelpiece or a piano or desk. For The Robe he commissioned a Grecian bust which appears prominently in a Roman villa. Henry Koster went on to do numerous musicals and family comedies during the late 1930s and early 1940s, with Durbin, Betty Grable, and other musical stars of the era. He and Joe Pasternak filmed a successful screen test for Universal's newest singing star, Gloria Jean, but Koster would never direct one of her features; when Pasternak left Universal for Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer in June 1941, Koster went with him. Ironically, despite Koster's escape from Nazi Germany, when the United States entered World War II Koster was considered an enemy alien and had to stay in his house in the evening. Actor Charles Laughton would visit Koster and play chess with him. Koster (left) with producer Samuel G. Engel and cameraman Arthur Arling on the set of The Story of Ruth (1960). Koster's postwar career was equally successful. He was nominated for an Academy Award for The Bishop's Wife (1947). In 1950 he directed what was his biggest success to date, the James Stewart comedy Harvey. He directed Richard Burton's first U.S. film, My Cousin Rachel, and then was given the first CinemaScope film to direct, The Robe in 1953. He directed some more costume dramas, including D√©sir√©e (1954) with Marlon Brando, The Virgin Queen (1955) with Bette Davis, The Naked Maja (1958) with Ava Gardner and The Story of Ruth (1960) with Elana Eden, then went back to family comedies and musicals, including Flower Drum Song for Universal in 1961. His last picture was The Singing Nun in 1965. Koster retired to Leisure Village, Camarillo, California, to indulge in his lifelong interest in painting. He painted a series of portraits of the movie stars with whom he worked. Although Koster never won an Oscar himself, he directed six different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Cecil Kellaway, Loretta Young, Celeste Holm, Elsa Lanchester, Josephine Hull, James Stewart and Richard Burton.

A turning wye is a specific case. Where two rail lines join, or in a joint between a railroad's mainline and a spur, wyes can be used as a mainline rail junction to allow incoming consists ability to travel either direction, or in order to allow trains to pass from one line to the other line. Wyes can also be used for turning railway equipment, and generally cover less area than a balloon loop doing the same job but at the cost of two additional sets of points to construct, then maintain. These turnings are accomplished by performing the railway equivalent of a three-point turn through successive junctions of the wye, the direction of travel and the relative orientation of a locomotive or railway vehicle can be reversed, resulting in it facing in the direction from which it came. When and where a wye is built specifically for equipment reversing purposes, one or more of the tracks making up the junction will typically be a stub siding. In materials and annual taxes, the cost of two junctions is offset by saved capital investment and yearly taxes. Tram or streetcar tracks also make use of triangular junctions and sometimes have a short triangle or wye stubs to turn the car at the end of the line.  Considerations  = At junctions = The use of triangular junctions allows flexibility in routing trains from any line to any other line, without the need to reverse the train. For this reason they are common across most rail networks. Slower bi-directional trains may enter a wye, letting a faster one pass, and continue on the same direction providing service to nearby freight transport or a passenger station. Where one or more of the lines meeting at the junction are multi-track, the presence of a triangular junction does introduce a number of potential conflicting moves. For this reason, where traffic is heavy, the junction may incorporate flying junctions on some, or all, or the legs of the triangle. = For turning equipment = Illustration of the usage of a wye track for turning a rail vehicle From time to time it is necessary to turn both individual pieces of railroad equipment or whole trains. This may be because the piece of equipment is not directionally symmetrical, for example in the case of most steam locomotives and, in certain parts of the world, diesel locomotives, or where the train needs to run a particular direction, for example where it has dedicated tail end car such as an observation car. Even where equipment is symmetrical, periodic turning may still be necessary in order to even wear. There are several different techniques that can be used to achieve such turning. Railway turntables require the least space, but can generally only deal with a single piece of equipment at a time. Balloon or turning loops can turn trains of any length - up to the total length of the loop - in a single operation, but require far more space than wyes. Rail wyes can be constructed on sites where a loop would not be possible, and can turn trains up to the length of the stub tracks at the end of the wye. Railroad systems in North America and Australia have tended to have more wyes than railroads elsewhere. North American locomotives and cars (such as observation cars) are more likely to be directional than those found on other continents. In Canada and the United States, the railroad often was built before other structures, and railway builders had much more freedom to lay down tracks where they wished. Similarly many early Australian railways made use of wyes (particularly in rural locations) for their lower installation and maintenance costs when not constrained by space limitations, though the major trend in most states toward bidirectional locomotives and railcars from the 1960s onwards saw their necessity and use diminish. In Europe, although some use was made of bi-directional tank locomotives and push‚Äìpull trains, most steam locomotives were uni-directional. Because of land usage considerations, turntables were normally used to turn such locomotives, and most terminal stations and locomotive depots were so equipped. Over time, most diesel and electric locomotives ordered in Europe have been designed to be fully bi-directional, symmetrical, and normally with two driving cabs. Thus most turntables and, where they existed, rail wyes, have been taken out of use. = Streetcar or tram systems = Similar considerations apply to the use of triangular junctions and reversing wyes on streetcar and tram systems, as apply to mainline rail systems. Many, although by no means all, streetcar and tram systems use single ended vehicles that have doors on one side only, and that must be turned at each end of the route. However the vehicles used on such systems tend to have much smaller minimum curvature requirements than heavy rail equipment. This renders the use of a balloon loop more practical in a small amount of space, and with street-running vehicles such a loop can make use of side streets or street squares. However, although turning loops are the most common way of turning such vehicles, wye tracks are also sometimes used. = Disadvantages = A triangle may have a situational disadvantage in train operations when space constraints and routing of the local geography means taking the triangle connects to a desired destination, but locally bypasses a main station. In tight city environments, this can happen easily, as it did, for example, at Cootamundra West, Australia and Tecuci, Romania, where an extra passenger station had to be built to serve trains taking the shortcut. In contrast, the engineering of a terminus station such as Woodville Railway Station, New Zealand avoided this problem by building a balloon loop (reversing loop) so that trains can serve the main station in either direction without the need to reverse. In a midline station where it is desired to reverse a consist or locomotive, a double-track and turning wye arrangement are far more common. = Land usage = A park located within a triangular junction in Sydney, Australia The land within a triangle is cut off from the adjacent area (and normally fenced off) and has marginal value, so will be purposed mainly for the railways exclusive use ‚Äì generally be used for maintenance depots, storage, or vehicle parking. The triangular shape tends to be unsuited for rectangular buildings. On electrified lines substations tend to be located inside triangles, in part because the land is cheap, and also because it provides the most convenient and flexible sectioning arrangements.  Earliest examples  The earliest British (and possibly worldwide) example is the double-tracked triangle within Earlestown railway station on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was completed by the Grand Junction Railway in 1837. The triangle has two passenger platform faces on each of its three sides and five of the six platforms are in frequent (half-hourly etc.) use by passenger trains. When steam engines were in regular use the triangle (which is of course also traversed by freight trains) was also used to turn locomotives and can still be so used. There is an example on the Cromford and High Peak Railway, which was opened in 1831 as a horse-drawn railway, which may be earlier. This appears to have been used for reversing trains of wagons with end doors that have just come up the rope-hauled inclines to the highest level of the railway before they proceeded down the remaining inclines.Kay, Peter (1997). The Cromford & High Peak Railway: Part 2 Memories of the High Peak. Stafford, Robert Cartwright Productions. DVD. The site of this can still be seen near Hindlow, in Derbyshire, .Marshall, John (1982). The Cromford & High Peak Railway. Newton Abbot, Devon; and North Pomfret, Vermont: David & Charles. . p. 36.  Examples by country  = Australia = Double track triangle, drawn in one-rail style Sefton railway station in Sydney lies on one corner of a triangular junction, which allows trains to branch off in either direction, without the need to terminate or change ends. One train a day from Birrong to Sefton does terminate and reverse at Regents Park station (in order to clean the rust off the crossover rails). There is a goods branch from Chullora and, in the future, the possibility of a separate single track freight line. The three passenger stations at the vertices of the triangle have island platforms which make it convenient to change trains. The sharp curves of the triangle, and especially the turnouts on those sharp curves, restrict train speeds to between . A number of triangular junctions were built on the Victorian Railways network, both at major junctions, and for turning locomotives and train consists in places where the provision of a turntable was impractical or unnecessarily expensive. These included: * Wodonga ‚Äì Built on the junction of the Cudgewa Line and used to turn the consists of the Sydney Limited and Spirit of Progress trains. * Ararat * North Geelong ‚Äì built to allow trains to travel directly between Geelong, Ballarat or Melbourne without using a run-around or turntable. It was also used to turn trains, such as during the demonstration run of the Spirit of Progress in 1937. A triangular junction is used to turn tramcars on the Portland Cable Tram line in Portland, Victoria. = Ireland = In the Republic of Ireland, there are currently two triangular junctions in use. One is at Limerick Junction, and the other at Lavistown, near Kilkenny. The former allows direct Limerick‚ÄìDublin passenger trains to bypass Limerick Junction station, and is also occasionally used to turn steam locomotives on railtours, whilst the latter is used primarily by freight trains running between the Port of Waterford and County Mayo to avoid having to run around in Kilkenny station. In Belfast, Northern Ireland, a triangular junction exists at Great Victoria Street station. It is rarely used to turn locomotives, save the occasional steam engine. Usually, it is used by Enterprise express trains to bypass Great Victoria Street and continue on and terminate at Belfast Central. Commuter trains enter the junction from one direction (e.g. the Portadown line), stop at Great Victoria Street, and then continue out on the other direction towards Bangor station. Commuter trains on NI Railways are all diesel multiple unit railcars, so they do not need to use the junction as a turning method. The only other operational triangular junction in Ireland is Downpatrick Loop on the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. Originally constructed to allow direct Belfast‚ÄìNewcastle trains to bypass Downpatrick station, the triangle today forms the basis of a heritage railway, the only heritage railway of this type in the British Isles. There is one station at each end of the triangle and another in the southernmost corner. Historical triangular junctions in Ireland include Moyasta Junction on the West Clare line, the Monkstown/Greenisland/Bleach Green triangle on the Northern Counties Committee and Bundoran Junction on the Great Northern Railway. Though two sides of the former are still in mainline use, the 'back line' between Monkstown and Greenisland has been removed, whilst the latter was closed altogether in 1957. Additionally, the Great Northern's largest locomotive yard at Adelaide never had a turntable, using a dedicated turning triangle instead. = Italy = Railways in Italy used a number of for turning locomotives. This uses a pentagram layout, requiring four movements and three turnouts to reverse. It allows a smaller layout, without excessively tight curve radii, compared to a triangle. One of these still survives at of Carbonia in Sardinia. = Namibia = Tsumeb railway station in Namibia has two triangles. The first and smaller one is for turning engines and is near the station. The second and larger one is to bypass the dead-end station at Tsumeb for trains travelling directly between the new extension towards Angola and Windhoek.. DigitalGlobe. This direct bypass line can save an hour of shunting time, particularly if the train is longer than the loops in the station. = Switzerland = There is a turning triangle partly tunnelled into the mountain at Kleine Scheidegg at the summit of the 800mm gauge Wengernalpbahn in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland. Kleine Scheidegg is reached from two lower termini, Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, located on opposite sides of the col. Trains normally descend in the direction they have arrived from and are designed accordingly with the power unit at the lower end and seating angled to compensate for the gradient. They therefore have to be turned at the summit should it be necessary to make a through journey. Whilst limitations of space dictated that the triangle had to be partly constructed in tunnels it also ensures that in winter it is snow- free and is readily available in emergencies. =United Kingdom= Modified triangle at Grantham In Britain triangular layouts that could be used for turning locomotives were usually the result of junctions of two or more lines. There are many examples, including the one known as the Maindee triangle in Newport, South Wales. Here the ex-GWR South Wales mainline from London to Swansea is joined by another GWR line from Shrewsbury via Hereford. The significance of it is that steam-hauled trains can run to Newport and their engines be turned using the triangle. Its National Grid location is . Shrewsbury also has a triangular route formation that was used to turn steam locomotives, and is still available. A triangle, , was provided in 1989 adjacent to the transfer sidings for Wylfa Nuclear Power Station, near to Valley on Anglesey in Wales. This enables the North Wales Coast Line to be used by steam hauled excursions. The turntable at Holyhead has long been removed and the area re-developed and the sidings at Valley some 4 miles (6.4 km) from the terminus are the nearest suitable site. An unusual arrangement, unique in Britain, was constructed at Grantham. Its location was and it is shown on the 1963 edition of OS 1 inch to 1 mile sheet 113. It was built in the 1950s after the turntable at the locomotive shed failed and expenditure on a replacement was no longer justified. Locomotives requiring to be turned had to travel to Barkston Junction to traverse the triangular layout there (this was where Mallard with a dynamometer car attached was turned before starting out south on its record-breaking run on 3 July 1938). The journey to Barkston Junction and back was a time-consuming business involving a round trip of some along the busy East Coast Main Line. Eventually authority was given to construct a turning arrangement on a strip of spare land to the west of the main line, just south of Grantham station. There was insufficient space for a conventional triangle but this was overcome by constructing an 'inside-out' triangle whereby the approach tracks intersected in a scissors crossing. = United States = Many North American passenger terminals in large cities had wye tracks to allow the turning and backing of directional passenger trains onto a main line. Freight traffic could bypass the terminal through the wye. Notable examples include the Los Angeles Union Station, which has a double wye, the Saint Paul Union Depot, and the Memphis Union Station. A typical use for a stub-end passenger station would be as follows: A wye was incorporated at the 'throat' where the rows of tracks converged from the station. It facilitated the turning of trains. Each arriving train passed the wye and came to a stop. Once the switches on the wye are aligned, the train reversed, with the brakeman at the rear of the last car regulating the speed with the brake lever upon approach to the platform and then coming to a complete stop at the end of the track, shutting the air brakes completely. Passengers were then allowed to safely disembark. Meanwhile, the locomotives were uncoupled from the train and sent to the engine terminal to be serviced for their next assignment. Then, the head-end cars were uncoupled from the rest of the train and pulled by a station switcher to a parcel facility where express packages were unloaded. The departing train was reassembled, freshly cleaned and serviced for the next journey. A steam pipe from the station's steam generator was attached to the train's steam line from the rear to supply heat until the locomotives were coupled up front to supply steam. The train was announced for boarding with a list of destinations. With switches aligned, the train slowly departed to the main line, rounding the opposite leg from the one it reversed on upon arrival. The train returned to the place it arrived from. The Keddie Wye in Keddie, California, was built by the Western Pacific Railroad and is a remarkable engineering feat. Two sides of the wye are built on tall trestles and one side is a tunnel bored through solid rock. The town of Wyeville, Wisconsin, is named after the Union Pacific Railway, formerly the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company wye and crossover nearby. A primary feature of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system is the Oakland Wye. Located beneath Downtown Oakland, California, the vast majority of the system's trains run through the wye primarily to and from San Francisco with some services running north and south along the East Bay. This section of track is considered a bottleneck for system-wide capacity based on speed restrictions and timing difficulties from distant branch lines. The southern terminus of the Amtrak Auto Train in Sanford, Florida, uses a wye to turn the locomotives around for the trip back north. A road that crosses the eastern side of the wye allows access to the inner part of the wye where a rock supply company now stands. In Arizona, the Grand Canyon Railway (GCRY) has a wye at both the Williams and South Rim/Grand Canyon Village termini of its line. The train is turned around at the South Rim/Grand Canyon Village wye with the passengers on board. At the Williams end, the train is turned around after the passengers disembark. The Chowchilla Wye is a primary feature of the planned California High-Speed Rail System. It will initially allow for transfers from feeder services on the third leg and facilitate more routing options when future phases are completed.  Convoluted wye  The 'reversing star' compared to the ordinary wye Convoluted wye, turning star or reversing star () is a special wye layout used in places where the space is tight. It has a pentagram-like form and consists of five turnouts (versus three for a wye) and three diamond crossings. Because of this, a reversing star is more expensive to build and service. It takes four changes of direction of movement to turn a piece of rolling stock on a reversing star.

After being detached and seconded to the French, they wore the Adrian helmet, while retaining the rest of their U.S. uniform. Seen here at S√©chault, France on 29 September 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, they wear the U.S. Army-issue Brodie helmet, correct for that time. The 369th Infantry Regiment, formerly known as the 15th New York National Guard Regiment and commonly referred to as the Harlem Hellfighters, was an infantry regiment of the New York Army National Guard during World War I and World War II. The Regiment consisted mainly of African Americans, though it also included several Puerto Rican Americans during World War II. With the 370th Infantry Regiment, it was known for being one of the first African American regiments to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. The regiment was nicknamed the Black Rattlers. The nickname Men of Bronze () was given to the regiment by the French and Hell-fighters () was given to them by the Germans.http://www.blackpast.org/aah/369th-infantry- regiment-harlem-hellfighters During WWI, the 369th spent 191 days in frontline trenches, more than any other American unit. They also suffered the most losses of any American regiment with 1,500 casualties.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/one-hundred-years-ago- harlem-hellfighters-bravely-led-us-wwi-180968977/ Background Emmett Jay Scott (undated) helped form the Hellfighters On October 5, 1917 Emmett Jay Scott, long-time secretary to Booker T. Washington, was appointed Special Assistant to Newton D. Baker, the Secretary of War. Scott was to serve as a confidential advisor in situations that involved the well-being of ten million African Americans and their roles in the war. While many African Americans who served in the Great War believed racial discrimination would dissipate once they returned home, that did not happen. Racism after World War I was probably at its worst until the start of World War II. Although many African Americans were eager to fight in the war, they were often turned away from military service. When the United States realized that it did not have close to enough soldiers, it decided to pass the Selective Service Act of 1917 which required all men from the ages of 21 to 30 to register for the draft; this included African Americans as well. This would give African Americans the opportunity that they needed to try and change the way they were perceived by their white compatriots. The 369th Regiment was formed from the National Guard's 15th Regiment in New York. The 15th Regiment was formed after Charles S. Whitman was elected Governor of New York. He enforced the legislation that was passed due to the efforts of the 10th Cavalry in Mexico, which had passed as a law that had not manifested until 2 June 1913. When the U.S. entered World War I, many African Americans believed that entering the armed forces would help eliminate racial discrimination throughout the United States. Many felt it was \\"a God-sent blessing\\" so they could prove they deserved respect from their white compatriots through service in the armed forces. Through the efforts of the Central Committee of Negro College Men and President Wilson, a special training camp to train black officers for the proposed black regiments were established. World War I =Formation= The 369th Infantry Regiment was constituted on 2 June 1913 in the New York Army National Guard as the 15th New York Infantry Regiment. The 369th Infantry was organized on 29 June 1916 at New York City. The infantry was called into Federal service on 25 July 1917 at Camp Whitman, New York. While at Camp Whitman, the 369th Infantry learned basic military practices. These basics included military courtesy, how to address officers and how to salute. Along with these basics, they also learned how to stay low and out of sight during attacks, stand guard and how to march in formation. After their training at Camp Whitman, the 369th was called into active duty in New York. While in New York, the 369th was split into three battalions in which they guarded rail lines, construction sites and other camps throughout New York. Then on 8 October 1917 the Regiment traveled to Camp Wadsworth in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where they received training in actual combat. Camp Wadsworth was set up similar to the French battlefields. While at Camp Wadsworth they experienced significant racism from the local communities and from other units. There was one incident in which two soldiers from the 15th Regiment, Lieutenant James Reese Europe and Noble Sissle, were refused by the owner of a hotel shop when they attempted to buy a newspaper. Several soldiers from the white 27th Division, a New York National Guard organization, came to aid their fellow soldiers. Lieutenant Europe had commanded them to leave before violence erupted. There were many other shops that refused to sell goods to the members of the 15th Regiment, so members of the 27th Division told the shop owners that if they did not serve black soldiers that they can close their stores and leave town. The white soldiers then stated \\"They're our buddies. And we won't buy from men who treat them unfairly.\\" The 15th Infantry Regiment NYARNG was assigned on 1 December 1917 to the 185th Infantry Brigade. It was commanded by Col. William Hayward, a member of the Union League Club of New York, which sponsored the 369th in the tradition of the 20th U.S. Colored Infantry, which the club had sponsored in the U.S. Civil War. The 15th Infantry Regiment shipped out from the New York Port of Embarkation on 27 December 1917, and joined its brigade upon arrival in France. The unit was relegated to labor service duties instead of combat training. The 185th Infantry Brigade was assigned on 5 January 1918 to the 93rd Division [Provisional]. The 15th Infantry Regiment, NYARNG was reorganized and re-designated on 1 March 1918 as the 369th Infantry Regiment, but the unit continued labor service duties while it awaited a decision as to its future. =Assignment to French Army 1918= 15th Infantry in France, wearing French helmets The U.S. Army decided on 8 April 1918 to assign the unit to the French Army for the duration of American participation in the war because many white American soldiers refused to perform combat duty with blacks. The men were issued French weapons, helmets, belts, and pouches, although they continued to wear their U.S. uniforms. While in the United States, the 369th Regiment was subjected to intense racial discrimination, and its members looked down upon. French Colonel J.L.A. Linard of the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters was persuaded to write the notorious pamphlet Secret Information Concerning Black American Troops, which \\"warned\\" French civilian authorities of the alleged inferior nature and supposed racist tendencies of African Americans. In France, the 369th was treated as if they were no different than any other French unit. For the most part, the French did not show hatred towards them and did not racially segregate the 369th. The French accepted the all black 369th Regiment with open arms and welcomed them to their country. The French army had from the start included many colonial units with non-white personnel from among others Morocco and Senegal. Also, since they faced manpower shortages, they were less concerned with race than the Americans. The 369th Infantry Regiment was relieved 8 May 1918 from assignment to the 185th Infantry Brigade, and went into the trenches as part of the French 16th Division. It served continuously until 3 July before returning to combat in the Second Battle of the Marne. Later, the 369th was reassigned to Gen. Lebouc's 161st Division to participate in the Allied counterattack. On one tour, they were out for over six months, which was the longest deployment of any unit in World War I.93d Division: Summary of Operations in the World War (1944) On 19 August, the regiment went off the line for rest and training of replacements. While overseas, the Hellfighters saw enemy propaganda intended for them. It claimed Germans had done nothing wrong to blacks, and they should be fighting the USA, which had oppressed them for years. It had the opposite of the intended effect. On 25 September 1918, the French 4th Army went on the offensive in conjunction with the American drive in the Meuse‚ÄìArgonne. The 369th turned in a good account in heavy fighting, though they sustained severe losses. The unit captured the important village of S√©chault. At one point the 369th advanced faster than French troops on their right and left flanks, and risked being cut off. By the time the regiment pulled back for reorganization, it had advanced through severe German resistance. In mid-October the regiment was moved to a quiet sector in the Vosges, where it was stationed there on 11 November, the day of the Armistice. Six days later, the 369th made its last advance and on 26 November, reaching the banks of the river Rhine and becoming the first Allied unit to do so. The regiment was relieved on 12 December 1918 from assignment to the French 161st Division. It returned to the New York Port of Embarkation and was demobilized on 28 February 1919 at Camp Upton at Yaphank, New York, and returned to the New York Army National Guard. =Honors= Wartime poster of the 369th fighting German soldiers, with the figure of Abraham Lincoln above Flag of the old 15th N.Y.N.G.Regiment {at left} after being decorated by the French and US National Flag Onehttps://www.businessinsider.com/records-may-show-black-world- war-i-soldiers-denied-award-due-to-racism-2018-10 Medal of Honor and numerous Distinguished Service Crosses were awarded to members of the regiment. Perhaps the most celebrated man in the 369th was Pvt. Henry Johnson, a former Albany, New York, rail station porter, who earned the nickname \\"Black Death\\" for his actions in combat in France. In May 1918 Johnson and Pvt. Needham Roberts fought off a 24-man German patrol, though both were severely wounded. After they expended their ammunition, Roberts used his rifle as a club and Johnson battled with a bolo knife. Reports suggest Johnson killed at least four German soldiers and might have wounded 30 others. Usually, black achievements and valor went unnoticed, despite the fact over 100 men from the 369th were presented with American and/or French decorations. Among those honors93d Division: Summary of Operations in the World War (1944) Johnson was the first American to receive the Croix de Guerre. On 13 December 1918, one month after Armistice day, the French government awarded the Croix de Guerre to 170 individual members of the 369th, and a unit citation was awarded to the entire regiment. It was pinned to the unit's colors by General Lebouc. Soldiers of the 369th (15th N.Y.), awarded the Croix de Guerre for gallantry in action, 1919. Left to right. Front row: Pvt.

Taylor One of the first units in the United States armed forces to have black officers in addition to all-black enlisted men, the 369th could boast of a fine combat record, a regimental Croix de Guerre, and several unit citations, along with many individual decorations for valor from the French government. Nevertheless, the poor replacement system ‚Äîcoupled with no respite from the line ‚Äî took its toll, leaving the unit utterly exhausted by the armistice in November. The 369th Infantry Regiment was the first New York unit to return to the United States, and was the first unit to march up Fifth Avenue from the Washington Square Park Arch to their armory in Harlem. Their unit was placed on the permanent list with other veteran units. In recapping the story of the 369th, Arthur W. Little, who had been a battalion commander, wrote in the regimental history From Harlem to the Rhine, it was official that the outfit was 191 days under fire, never lost a foot of ground or had a man taken prisoner; on two occasions men were captured, but were recovered. Only once did it fail to take its objective and that was due largely to bungling by French artillery support. By the end of the 369th Infantry's campaign in World War, I they were present in the Champagne ‚Äì Marne, Meuse ‚Äì Argonne, Champagne 1918, Alsace 1918 campaigns in which they suffered 1,500 casualties, the highest of any U.S. regiment. In addition, the unit was plagued by acute discipline problems resulting from disproportionate casualties among the unit's longest-serving members and related failures to assimilate new soldiers. The 369th also fought in distinguished battles such as Belleau Wood and Chateau-Thierry. 369th Regiment Military Band The 369th band played jazz for American wounded in the courtyard of a Paris hospital The 369th Regiment \\"Hellfighters Band\\" was relied upon not only in battle but also for morale. So by the end of their tour, they became one of the most famous military bands throughout Europe. They followed the 369th overseas and were highly regarded and known for being able to immediately boost morale. While overseas the 369th Regiment made up less than 1% of the soldiers deployed but was responsible for over 20% of the territory of all the land assigned to the United States. During the war the 369th's regimental band (under the direction of James Reese Europe) became famous throughout Europe. It introduced the until-then unknown music called jazz to British, French and other European audiences. The 369th Infantry (old 15th National Guard) parade through New York City. At the end of the war, the 369th returned to New York City, and on 17 February 1919, paraded through the city. This day became an unofficial holiday of sorts for all of Harlem. Many black school children were dismissed from school so that they could attend the parade. With the addition of many adults there were thousands of people that lined the streets to see the 369th Regiment: the parade began on Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, proceeded uptown past ranks of white bystanders, turned west on 110th Street, and then turned onto Lenox Avenue, and marched into Harlem, where black New Yorkers packed the sidewalks to see them. The parade became a marker of African American service to the nation, a frequent point of reference for those campaigning for civil rights. There were multiple parades that took place throughout the nation, many of these parades included all black regiments, including the 370th from Illinois. Then in the 1920s and 1930s, the 369th was a regular presence on Harlem's streets, each year marching through the neighborhood from their armory to catch a train to their annual summer camp, and then back through the neighborhood on their return two weeks later. Tap dancer and actor Bill Robinson was claimed to have been also the drum major for the regimental band during the homecoming parade on Fifth Avenue upon the 369th's return from overseas.Added 30 July 2008, by the Director of the National Guard Educational Foundation. This has however been questioned as this is not mentioned in either his biography by Jim Haskins or the biography of James Europe. Coast Artillery lineage After the war, the regiment was spread out throughout New York and still maintained some military exercises. In 1924, they were reorganized as the 369th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft) Regiment. They were then deployed to Hawaii and parts of the West Coast. :Constituted in the New York National Guard as 369th Coast Artillery (AA) (United States Army Coast Artillery Corps) on 11 October 1921 as follows: * HHB from HHB 369th Infantry Regiment * 1st Battalion from 1st Battalion 369th Infantry * 2nd Battalion from 2nd Battalion 369th infantry Inducted into federal service 13 January 1941 at New York City Regiment was broken up 12 December 1943 as Follows- * HHB as 369th Antiaircraft Artillery Group (Colored) (disbanded November 1944) * 1st battalion as 369th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (semi mobile) (Colored) (See 369th Sustainment Brigade (United States)). * 2nd Battalion as 870th Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion (Colored). (see 970th Field Artillery Battalion.) World War II In May 1942, the 369th Infantry Regiment was re- established as an element of the 93rd Infantry Division (Colored), although not listed as a New York National Guard unit. It was deployed overseas and participated in labor and security operations in the Southwest Pacific Area. The 369th, along with the rest of the 93rd Infantry Division, occupied Morotai in Dutch New Guinea from April to June 1945, seeing limited combat. The division redeployed to Zamboanga in the Philippines on 1 July 1945, where it conducted \\"mop up\\" patrols until the Japanese surrendered on 15 August. The 369th left the Philippines with the division on 17 January 1946, returning to the United States on 1 February. The unit was deactivated two days later. Armory In 1933, the 369th Regiment Armory was created to honor the 369th regiment for their service. This armory stands at 142nd and Fifth Avenue, in the heart of Harlem. This armory was constructed starting in the 1920s and was completed in the 1930s. The 369th Regiment Armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 and was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1985. Later years The infantry's polished post-World War I reputation was not completely safe from external criticism, which ultimately surfaced as a result of ongoing racial tension in the United States. In 1940, the Chicago Defender reported that the United States Department of War arranged for the 369th regiment to be renamed the \\"Colored Infantry.\\" The department announced that there were too many infantry units in the national guard and the 369th regiment would be among those slated to go, the first alleged step toward abolishing the famed unit. Supporters of the regiment swiftly objected to the introduction of racial identity in the title of a unit in the United States army, effectively preserving the regiment's reputation. However, eventually, all African American US Army units were renamed as \\"Colored,\\" and the 369th served in World War II as the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft) (Colored), with its successor being the 369th Infantry Regiment (Colored). In 2003, the New York State Department of Transportation renamed the Harlem River Drive as the \\"Harlem Hellfighters Drive.\\" On 29 September 2006 a twelve-foot high monument was unveiled to honor the 369th Regiment. This statue is a replica of a monument that stands in France. The monument is made of black granite and contains the 369th crest and rattlesnake insignia. Descending units of the 369th Infantry Regiment have continued to serve since World War I. The 369th Infantry Regiment continued to serve up until World War II where they would be reorganized into the 369th Anti-aircraft Artillery Regiment. The newly formed regiment would serve in Hawaii and throughout much of the West Coast. Another 369th Infantry Regiment was raised in 1942 as part of the 93rd Infantry Division (Colored), but is not listed as a New York National Guard unit. At some time postwar, the 369th was re-formed into the present-day 369th Sustainment Brigade. Notable soldiers * Benjamin O.

The silver rattlesnake on the blue shield was the distinctive regimental insignia of the 369th Infantry Regiment, ancestor of the unit, and alludes to the service of the organization during World War I. ; Background The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 369th Infantry Regiment on 17 April 1923. It was redesignated for the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment on 3 December 1940. It was redesignated for the 369th Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion on 7 January 1944. It was redesignated for the 569th Field Artillery Battalion on 14 August 1956. The insignia was redesignated for the 369th Artillery Regiment on 4 April 1962. It was amended to correct the wording of the description on 2 September 1964. It was redesignated for the 569th Transportation Battalion and amended to add a motto on 13 March 1969. The insignia was redesignated for the 369th Transportation Battalion and amended to delete the motto on 14 January 1975. It was redesignated for the 369th Support Battalion and amended to revise the description and symbolism on 2 November 1994. The insignia was redesignated for the 369th Sustainment Brigade and amended to revise the description and symbolism on 20 July 2007. 369th Veterans' Association The 369th Veterans' Association is a group created to honor those who served in the 369th infantry. This veterans group has three distinct goals. According to the Legal Information Institute of the Cornell Law Institute these include,\\"promoting the principles of friendship and goodwill among its members; engaging in social and civic activities that tend to enhance the welfare of its members and inculcate the true principles of good citizenship in its members; and memorializing, individually and collectively, the patriotic services of its members in the 369th antiaircraft artillery group and other units in the Armed Forces of the United States.\\" Fiction Fictionalized accounts featuring the Harlem Hellfighters include the 2014 graphic novel The Harlem Hellfighters written by Max Brooks and illustrated by Caanan White. It depicts a fictionalized account of the 369th's tour in Europe during World War I. a film adaptation of the aforementioned novel is in the works under Sony Pictures and Overbrook Entertainment. The unit was also included as part of the single- player campaign's prologue \\"Storm of Steel\\" in the video game Battlefield 1, set during the first World War. Additionally, the collector's edition of the game included a statue of an African-American soldier from the unit. Most of the earned \\"PTFO\\" weapon skins have references to the Harlem Hellfighters on them as well as the special Hellfighter pistol and shotgun being largely gold.

A player who engages in such behavior is known as a twink. The precise definition of twinking varies depending on the variety of role-playing game: *In \\"pen and paper\\" role-playing games, a twink is often synonymous with a munchkin, i.e. a powergamer who seeks to acquire power and loot at the expense of their teammates. *In MUDs - Multi-User Dungeons or Domains -a twink is a player who is variously anything from a munchkin to a newbie (new player) to a griefer, or a bad faith player. *In Massively multiplayer online role-playing games, or MMORPGs, twinking refers to a character gaining equipment with the assistance of a higher level character, particularly by giving the low level character higher level equipment that is otherwise unattainable. It can also be used to describe the process of keeping a video game character at a low level while using in-game currency, earned by a high level character, to provide it with superior equipment. RPGs In role-playing video games, particularly MMORPGs, twinking refers to outfitting a new character or player with items or other resources that are not normally available to new or low- level characters. A twink in this usage is a type of powergamer and munchkin. The term can also refer to the twinked character itself (e.g., \\"My twink has all the best gear.\\"). In its most basic definition, a twink is a character with better gear than one could have easily acquired on one's own. Twinking is typically done by transferring higher-end equipment from the player's (or their friend's) more-experienced characters (who often have excess gear that would be much more useful to the lower-level character). It can also be done by equipping the character with the best possible gear for their level range, and filling them with end-game enchantments. Many new players dislike twinking of others' characters, since it gives a big advantage to established players starting a new character. Some new players do not like to have their own characters twinked, as they prefer to earn the equipment for themselves. It is common for twinking items to be traded at good values due to persistent demand. Sometimes, this will go so far as to inflate twink equipment prices, as high-level players are willing to pay more than a newbie would be able to. =Examples= Twinking can happen whenever players can interact and trade with each other, regardless of how present other players can be in the game itself; the handheld roleplaying game Pok√©mon, as an example, allows players to trade their Pok√©mon with each other. Twinking was once very common in the CORPG Guild Wars, when players would have their low-level characters taken by high-level characters to end-game areas to obtain the best armor, weapons, and skills available (Different terms are used to describe this action: being \\"carried through\\", \\"Pushed through\\", \\"boosted\\", \\"getting a boost\\".) as Guild Wars does not have a level limit on such things. These twinked characters would then return to low-level PvP areas to fight significantly disadvantaged opponents. This practice became so proliferate that the Guild Wars development team introduced a patch prohibiting characters with high-level armor entering beginner arenas. World of Warcraft includes items that are specifically intended to make twinking more viable but less disruptive. These items belong to the \\"Heirloom\\" rarity class and have a number of unique characteristics. Their most unusual attribute is that they bind to a player's account rather than the character, allowing them to be handed down from higher-level characters to lower-level ones but prohibiting them from being transferred from veteran players to new players. Thus, the twinking player is still required to earn these items, even if the twinked character does not. The other distinguishing characteristics of Heirlooms are that they have no real level requirement and their properties scale with character level, making them usable by and useful to all characters equally regardless of level. In addition to heirlooms, World of Warcraft also includes an option whereby a character may pay 10 gold to disable experience-gain and thereby maintain a specific level. This enables the twink to more easily farm for Honor Points (The in-game currency used to purchase weapons and armour for PvP combat) in player versus player battlegrounds by permanently remaining at the highest playable level for their battleground bracket (e.g. level 19 for the 15‚Äì19 battleground bracket, level 74 for the 70‚Äì74 battleground bracket, etc.). The character can also attempt to obtain the best possible item per equipment slot available to that specific level. The character may attempt this solo, in groups, or with the help from high-level characters. By competing at the highest level allowed in the battleground bracket, and equipped with the best possible gear, twinks played with a significant advantage over regular players. New players as well as low level players in the battleground bracket were often at a severe disadvantage in games that fielded numerous twinks. Because of the gear and/or experience advantage, twinks often easily overpowered new and low-level players, quickly eliminating them from play. Consequently, these players experienced little of the actual gameplay. Battlegrounds often had twinks playing for both factions, Horde and Alliance, leveling the playing field to an extent, but winning and losing could be grossly influenced by which faction fielded fewer twinks. However, because of the large twink communities, especially at lower level brackets, battlegrounds were often filled with organized teams of twinks competing against each other. Another example of twinking can be found in the MMORPG Anarchy Online where twinking is performed by buffing base stats using items (stat buffing weapons, armour) and laddering implants (laddering is a method by which the character equips higher implants by climbing quality levels one by one as one does, a ladder). Once a high-stat buffing item is equipped, it stays equipped even if the stats required to initially equip it decline or wear off, though a penalty can be applied if the base stats fall too far below the equipping requirements. Twinking is an essential component to this game in both PvP and in soloing Instances within the game. Whereas twinking is seen in negative light in other MMORPGS it is seen in positive light in Anarchy Online. In other online RPGs, such as Dark Souls, twinking can be done through a few methods, including gaining the help of other players who are at a higher level in order to have them clear content before it should be accessible, memorizing the locations of particular powerful items, and utilizing very specific strategies to advance further in the storyline than should otherwise be possible. This has a more direct effect on game play, especially in any game which involves online player-versus-player (PvP) combat such as Dark Souls, as the result can be two players who appear to be evenly matched on the surface being vastly unbalanced in terms of items or weaponry available to them. While a game's developers may not consider these tactics to be outright exploitation of the underlying game engine, often these tactics are 'nerfed' in some way in order to discourage twinking, such as removing, repositioning, or reducing the effectiveness of certain items within the game to make the progression more linear between players. Some games such as Borderlands 2 feature an in-game method of transferring items between characters on the same account. This is done in Borderlands through a storage container located in the game's central hub, allowing up to four items to be stored and retrieved by any of the player's characters. =Countermeasures= *Many games have item restrictions that prevent low-level characters from using higher-level items and upsetting game balance; in Diablo II and The Lord of the Rings Online, most items require a minimum ability score or level to equip. This did not totally prevent the problem of higher-level characters handing down gold or very powerful gear though, it just changed what could be used in this strategy. *Some games, such as World of Warcraft (WoW), Anarchy Online (AO), EverQuest (EQ), and The Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO) have certain items become restricted to one character‚Äî\\"Soulbound\\" (WoW), \\"NoDrop\\" (AO), \\"No Trade\\" (EQ), or \\"Bound\\" (LOTRO) ‚Äîwhen the items are picked up, equipped, or used. These items cannot thereafter be transferred to other characters (even one's own characters on the same realm/server, with some limited exceptions). Some items are bound to a specific account (\\"Bind To Account\\" in WoW, \\"Heirloom\\" in EQ, \\"Bound to account\\" in LOTRO) and cannot be transferred to other people's accounts, but can be traded between characters on the same account. *WoW further reduced twinking in Battlegrounds (player-versus-player combat arenas) by awarding experience points for Battleground victories, so that as PvP characters gain experience, they also gain levels and thus become disqualified from lower-level brackets. Additionally, some of the best-in-slot items became \\"heirlooms\\" which apply a percentage increase to all experience point gains. Players can disable experience point gain for an in-game fee, but must play in separate Battlegrounds as long as they do so (commonly referred to as \\"no- EXP,\\" \\"xp-off,\\" or \\"twink only\\" battlegrounds) where most of the other players will also be twinkers. Queue times in many brackets now show \\"unavailable\\" due to not enough people queueing up in the respective level brackets. As of February 9, 2012, WoW brackets 15‚Äì19, 20‚Äì24, and 70‚Äì74 are the only full-time active brackets with 70‚Äì74 being the largest Level brackets were also split in half, so there are separate levels 10‚Äì14 and 15‚Äì19 brackets instead of a single 10-19 bracket (and so on through the higher brackets). Thus, players only compete against other players who are closer in level to themselves. *WoW eliminated twinking in PvP combat arenas in patch 7.0.3, by removing all stats gained from equipment upon entry and instead giving the character predetermined PvP stats based on its class and specialization. *Pok√©mon games use a badge system, which makes Pok√©mon above a certain level tougher to control, making random actions and falling asleep instead of obeying commands until the trainer has completed enough of the campaign. Etymology There are several possible etymologies for the word. It may not have been derived from a single source, instead evolving from multiple convergent usages. Its exact origin is unclear. The gay-slang usage of \\"twink\\" has been suggested as a likely origin. One of the connotations of this usage is \\"a young/inexperienced person who can outfit himself fashionably because of financial benefits from an older/experienced sugar daddy.\\" This parallels MMORPGs, where in-game money is a strong limiting factor in the virtual economy and gear is usually in the form of clothing and jewelry. The word \\"twink\\" appeared in the Ultima Online: Renaissance playguide in the glossary of terms (copyrighted in 2000). It was asserted to have a meaning similar to its current one, but also included powerlevelling. On the MUD Sojourn, which several creators of EverQuest played, \\"twink\\" was alternately used to refer to powerleveling and metagaming. As MUDs date to 1978, this use of the term may possibly predate later uses. The term twink and twinking predated MMOs and was prevalent in many MUDs. The term came from flags on much of the high-end gear that cause gear to be displayed as (twinkling) . It was not an alternate name for powerleveling, but could be used as a method of powerleveling.

Nails correspond to claws found in other animals. Fingernails and toenails are made of a tough protective protein called alpha-keratin which is found in the hooves, hair, claws and horns of vertebrates. Structure A. Nail plate; B. lunula; C. root; D. sinus; E. matrix; F. nail bed; G. hyponychium; H. free margin. The nail consists of the nail plate, the nail matrix and the nail bed below it, and the grooves surrounding it. =Parts of the nail= The matrix, sometimes called the matrix unguis, keratogenous membrane, nail matrix, or onychostroma, is the tissue (or germinal matrix) which the nail protects. It is the part of the nail bed that is beneath the nail and contains nerves, lymph and blood vessels. The matrix produces cells that become the nail plate. The width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip bone determines if the nail plate is flat, arched, or hooked. The matrix will continue to produce cells as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition. As new nail plate cells are made, they push older nail plate cells forward; and in this way older cells become compressed, flat, and translucent. This makes the capillaries in the nail bed below visible, resulting in a pink color. The lunula (\\"small moon\\") is the visible part of the matrix, the whitish crescent-shaped base of the visible nail. The lunula can best be seen in the thumb and may not be visible in the little finger. The nail bed is the skin beneath the nail plate. Like all skin, it is made of two types of tissues: the deeper dermis, the living tissue which includes capillaries and glands, and the epidermis, the layer just beneath the nail plate, which moves toward the finger tip with the plate. The epidermis is attached to the dermis by tiny longitudinal \\"grooves\\" called matrix crests (cristae matricis unguis). In old age, the nail plate becomes thinner, and these grooves become more visible. The nail sinus (sinus unguis) is where the nail root is; i.e. the base of the nail underneath the skin. It originates from the actively growing tissue below, the matrix. The nail plate (corpus unguis) is the hard part of the nail, made of translucent keratin protein. Several layers of dead, compacted cells cause the nail to be strong but flexible. Its (transverse) shape is determined by the form of the underlying bone. In common usage, the word nail often refers to this part only. The free margin (margo liber) or distal edge is the anterior margin of the nail plate corresponds to the abrasive or cutting edge of the nail. The hyponychium (informally known as the \\"quick\\") is the epithelium located beneath the nail plate at the junction between the free edge and the skin of the fingertip. It forms a seal that protects the nail bed. The onychodermal band is the seal between the nail plate and the hyponychium. It is just under the free edge, in that portion of the nail where the nail bed ends and can be recognized in fair-skinned people by its glassy, greyish colour. It is not visible in some individuals while it is highly prominent on others. Eponychium Together, the eponychium and the cuticle form a protective seal. The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of almost invisible dead skin cells that \\"ride out on\\" and cover the back of the visible nail plate while the eponychium is the fold of skin cells that produces the cuticle. They are continuous, and some references view them as one entity; in this classification, the names eponychium, cuticle, and perionychium are synonymous. It is the cuticle (nonliving part) that is removed during a manicure, but the eponychium (living part) should not be touched due to risk of infection. The eponychium is a small band of living cells (epithelium) that extends from the posterior nail wall onto the base of the nail. The eponychium is the end of the proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed nail plate. The perionyx is the projecting edge of the eponychium covering the proximal strip of the lunula. The nail wall (vallum unguis) is the cutaneous fold overlapping the sides and proximal end of the nail. The lateral margin (margo lateralis) lies beneath the nail wall on the sides of the nail, and the nail groove or fold (sulcus matricis unguis) are the cutaneous slits into which the lateral margins are embedded. Paronychium The paronychium is the soft tissue border around the nail, and paronychia is an infection in this area. Hyponychium The hyponychium is the area of epithelium, particularly the thickened portion, underlying the free edge of the nail plate. It is sometimes called the quick as in the phrase 'cutting to the quick'. Function A healthy fingernail has the function of protecting the distal phalanx, the fingertip, and the surrounding soft tissues from injuries. It also serves to enhance precise delicate movements of the distal digits through counter-pressure exerted on the pulp of the finger. The nail then acts as a counter-force when the end of the finger touches an object, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the fingertip, although the nail itself has no nerve endings. Finally, the nail functions as a tool enabling a so-called \\"extended precision grip\\" (e.g. pulling out a splinter in one's finger), and certain cutting or scraping actions. =Growth= The growing part of the nail is under the skin at the nail's proximal end under the epidermis, which is the only living part of a nail. In mammals, the growth rate of nails is related to the length of the terminal phalanges (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails. In humans, fingernails grow at an average rate of approx. a month, whereas toenails grow about half as quickly (approx. average a month). Fingernails require three to six months to regrow completely, and toenails require twelve to eighteen months. Actual growth rate is dependent upon age, sex, season, exercise level, diet, and hereditary factors.Hunter, J. A. A., Savin, J., & Dahl, M. V. (2002). Clinical dermatology. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Science. p. 173. The longest female nails known ever to have existed measured a total of 601.9 cm, an average of 60.19 cm (23.7 inches) for each fingernail. Contrary to popular belief, nails do not continue to grow after death; the skin dehydrates and tightens, making the nails (and hair) appear to grow. =Permeability= The nail is often considered an impermeable barrier, but this is not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin,K. A. Walters and G. L. Flynn, Permeability characteristics of the human nail plate, International Journal of Cosmetic Science 5, 231‚Äì46 (1983) and the composition of the nail includes 7‚Äì12% water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including paraquat, a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans, urea which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use on hands and fingers, and several fungicidal agents such as salicylic acid, miconazole branded Monistat, natamycin; and sodium hypochlorite which is the active ingredient in common household bleach (but usually only in 2‚Äì3% concentration). Clinical significance Thumbnail of the right hand with cuticle (left) and hangnail (top) Healthcare and pre-hospital-care providers (EMTs or paramedics) often use the fingernail beds as a cursory indicator of distal tissue perfusion of individuals who may be dehydrated or in shock.Monterey County EMS Manual . Chapter XI, Patient assessment. However, this test is not considered reliable in adults. This is known as the CRT or blanch test. The fingernail bed is briefly depressed to turn the nail-bed white. When the pressure is released, the normal pink colour should be restored within a second or two. Delayed return to pink color can be an indicator of certain shock states such as hypovolemia.St. Luke's Hospital. Capillary nail refill test. Nail growth record can show the history of recent health and physiological imbalances, and has been used as a diagnostic tool since ancient times.American Academy of Dermatology ‚Äì Nail Health Deep, horizontally transverse grooves known as \\"Beau's lines\\" may form across the nails (horizontal, not along the nail from cuticle to tip). These lines are usually a natural consequence of aging, although they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, Mees' lines, small white spots, receded lunula, clubbing (convex), flatness, and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury. Nails can also become thickened (onychogryphosis), loosened (onycholysis), infected with fungus (onychomycosis), or degenerate (onychodystrophy). A common nail disorder is an ingrowing toenail (onychocryptosis). DNA profiling is a technique employed by forensic scientists on hair, fingernails, toenails, etc. =Health and care= A set of professional nail care tools The best way to care for nails is to trim them regularly. Filing is also recommended, as to keep nails from becoming too rough and to remove any small bumps or ridges that may cause the nail to get tangled up in materials such as cloth. Bluish or purple fingernail beds may be a symptom of peripheral cyanosis, which indicates oxygen deprivation. Nails can dry out, just like skin. They can also peel, break, and be infected. Toe infections, for instance, can be caused or exacerbated by dirty socks, specific types of aggressive exercise (long-distance running), tight footwear, and walking unprotected in an unclean environment. Common organisms causing nail infections include yeasts and molds (particularly dermatophytes). Nail tools used by different people may transmit infections. Standard hygiene and sanitation procedures avoid transmission. In some cases, gel and cream cuticle removers can be used instead of cuticle scissors. Nail disease can be very subtle and should be evaluated by a dermatologist with a focus in this particular area of medicine. However, most times it is a nail technician who will note a subtle change in nail disease. Inherited accessory nail of the fifth toe occurs where the toenail of the smallest toe is separated, forming a smaller \\"sixth toenail\\" in the outer corner of the nail. Like any other nail, it can be cut using a nail clipper. =Effect of nutrition= Vitamin A is an essential micro-nutrient for vision, reproduction, cell and tissue differentiation, and immune function. Vitamin D and calcium work together in cases of maintaining homeostasis, creating muscle contraction, transmission of nerve pulses, blood clotting, and membrane structure. A lack of vitamin A, vitamin D, or calcium can cause dryness and brittleness. Insufficient vitamin B12 can lead to excessive dryness, darkened nails, and rounded or curved nail ends. Insufficient intake of both vitamin A and B results in fragile nails with horizontal and vertical ridges. Some over- the-counter vitamin supplements such as certain multivitamins and biotin may help in growth of strong nails, although this is quite subjective. Protein is a building material for new nails; therefore, low dietary protein intake may cause anemia and the resultant reduced hemoglobin in the blood filling the capillaries of the nail bed reflects varying amounts of light incident on the nail matrix resulting in lighter shades of pink ultimately resulting in white nail beds when the hemoglobin is very low. When hemoglobin is close to 15 or 16 grams, most of the spectrum of light is absorbed and only the pink color is reflected back and the nails look pink. Essential fatty acids play a large role in healthy skin as well as nails. Splitting and flaking of nails may be due to a lack of linoleic acid. Iron-deficiency anemia can lead to a pale color along with a thin, brittle, ridged texture. Iron deficiency in general may cause the nails to become flat or concave, rather than convex. Society and culture =Fashion= Toenails painted magenta Manicures (for the hands) and pedicures (for the feet) are health and cosmetic procedures to groom, trim, and paint the nails and manage calluses. They require various tools such as cuticle scissors, nail scissors, nail clippers, and nail files. Artificial nails can also be fixed onto real nails for cosmetic purposes. A person whose occupation is to cut, shape and care for nails as well as to apply overlays such as acrylic and UV gel is sometimes called a nail technician. The place where a nail technician works may be a nail salon or nail shop or nail bar.Nail art Painting the nails with colored nail polish (also called nail lacquer and nail varnish) to improve the appearance is a common practice dating back to at least 3000 B.C. With the rise of smartphones, some analysts have noted a trend of the nelfie (nail selfie), wherein people share their nail art online. =Length records= Guinness World Records began tracking record fingernail lengths in 1955, when a Chinese priest was listed as having fingernails long. The current record-holder for men, according to Guinness, is Shridhar Chillal from India who set the record in 1998 with a total of of nails on his left hand. His longest nail, on his thumb, was long. The record- holder for women is Lee Redmond of the U.S., who set the record in 2001 and as of 2008 had nails with a total length on both hands of , with the longest nail on her right thumb at . Evolution in primates distinguishing feature of the primate order. The nail is an unguis, meaning a keratin structure at the end of a digit. Other examples of ungues include the claw, hoof and talon. The nails of primates and the hooves of running mammals evolved from the claws of earlier animals. In contrast to nails, claws are typically curved ventrally (downwards in animals) and compressed sideways. They serve a multitude of functionsincluding climbing, digging, and fightingand have undergone numerous adaptive changes in different animal taxa. Claws are pointed at their ends and are composed of two layers: a thick, deep layer and a superficial, hardened layer which serves a protective function. The underlying bone is a virtual mold of the overlying horny structure and therefore has the same shape as the claw or nail. Compared to claws, nails are flat, less curved, and do not extend far beyond the tip of the digits. The ends of the nails usually consist only of the \\"superficial\\", hardened layer and are not pointed like claws. With only a few exceptions, primates retain plesiomorphic (original, \\"primitive\\") hands with five digits, each equipped with either a nail or a claw. For example, nearly all living strepsirrhine primates have nails on all digits except the second toe which is equipped with a grooming claw. Tarsiers have a grooming claw on second and third toes. Less commonly known, a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of owl monkeys (Aotus), titis (Callicebus), and possibly other New World monkeys. The needle-clawed bushbaby (Euoticus) has keeled nails (the thumb and the first and the second toes have claws) featuring a central ridge that ends in a needle-like tip. In tree shrews, all digits have claws and, unlike most primates, the digits of their feet are positioned close together, and therefore, the thumb cannot be brought into opposition (another usually distinguishing feature of primates). A study of the fingertip morphology of four small-bodied New World monkey species indicated a correlation between increasing small-branch foraging and: # expanded apical pads (fingertips), # developed epidermal ridges (fingerprints), # broadened distal parts of distal phalanges (fingertip bones), and # reduced flexor and extensor tubercles (attachments areas for finger muscles on bones). This suggests that whereas claws are useful on large-diameter branches, wide fingertips with nails and epidermal ridges were required for habitual locomotion on small-diameter branches. It also indicates keel-shaped nails of Callitrichines (a family of New World monkeys) is a derived postural adaptation rather than retained ancestral condition.

He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, but he was twice compelled to resign. He was twice the Senior Officer of the U.S. Army, appointed to be the first Governor of the Louisiana Territory in 1805, and commanded two unsuccessful campaigns in the St. Lawrence River theater during the War of 1812. He died while posted as a diplomat in Mexico City. In 1854, following extensive archival research in the Spanish archives in Madrid, Louisiana historian Charles Gayarr√© exposed Wilkinson as having been a highly paid spy in the service of the Spanish Empire. In the years since Gayarr√©'s research became public, Wilkinson has been savagely condemned by American historians and politicians. According to President Theodore Roosevelt, \\"[I]n all our history, there is no more despicable character.\\" However, he has been defended, especially in breaking up the Burr conspiracy.John Thornton Posey, \\"Rascality Revisited: In Defense of General James Wilkinson.\\" Filson Club Historical Quarterly 74 (2000): 309-52. Early life James Wilkinson was born on March 24, 1757, the son of Joseph Wilkinson and Alethea (Heighe) Wilkinson. Wilkinson's birthplace was about three miles (5 km) northeast of Benedict, Charles County, Maryland, on a farm south of Hunting Creek. Wilkinson's grandfather had been sufficiently wealthy to buy a large property known as Stoakley Manor in Calvert County. Even though James Wilkinson's family lived on a smaller estate than those of Maryland's elite, they still saw themselves as members of the higher social class. According to historian Andro Linklater, Wilkinson grew up with the idea that \\"the image of respectability excused the reality of betrayal\\". His father inherited Stoakley Manor but by then the family was in debt. Joseph Wilkinson died in 1763 and in 1764 Stoakley Manor was broken up and sold. Wilkinson's older brother Joseph inherited what was left of the manor property after his father died. As the second son, James Wilkinson inherited no land. Wilkinson's father had left him with the last words of \\"My son, if you ever put up with an insult, I will disinherit you.\\" Biographer Andro Linklater argued that this upbringing led to Wilkinson's aggressive reaction toward perceived insults. Wilkinson's early education by a private tutor was funded by his maternal grandmother. His study of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, also funded by his grandmother, was interrupted by the American Revolutionary War. Marriages Wilkinson married Ann Biddle (1742‚Äì1807) of the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia on November 12, 1778, in Philadelphia. She was a first cousin of Charles Biddle, an associate of Aaron Burr,Wheelan, p. 117 and Wilkinson's marriage to the dynamic Biddle helped his career as a politician and general.Hay, p. 34 She died on February 23, 1807.Hay, p. 36 The couple had four sons: John (1780‚Äì1796), James Biddle (c. 1783‚Äì1813),Hay, p. 35 Joseph Biddle (1789‚Äì1865), and Walter (born 1791). James and Walter both served as Captains in the US Army. On March 5, 1810, Wilkinson married Celestine Laveau Trudeau, widow of Thomas Urquhart and daughter of Charles Laveau Trudeau. They were the parents of twin girls Marie Isabel and Elizabeth Stephanie. Celestine's father, known in Louisiana as Don Carlos Trudeau, had served in the Spanish government of New Orleans. When the United States gained control of the city, he remained in New Orleans and anglicized his name. Marie Isabel Wilkinson died in infancy. Elizabeth Stephanie Wilkinson (1816-1871) married Professor Toussaint Francois Bigot (1794-1869) in 1833. Revolutionary War service Wilkinson first served in Thompson's Pennsylvania rifle battalion, 1775‚Äì76, and was commissioned a captain in September 1775. He served as an aide to Nathanael Greene during the Siege of Boston, participated in the placing of guns on the Dorchester Heights in March 1776, and following the British abandonment of Boston, went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene's staff and was given command of an infantry company. Sent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for Benedict Arnold's army besieging Quebec, he arrived just in time to witness the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General John Burgoyne ‚Äì which precipitated the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became aide to Arnold just prior to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. Shortly thereafter, he left Arnold's service and became an aide to General Horatio Gates in August 1776. When Gates sent him to Congress with official dispatches about the victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, Wilkinson kept Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he finally showed up, he embellished his own role in the victory, and was brevetted as a brigadier general (despite being only 20 years old at the time) on November 6, 1777, and appointed to the newly created Board of War. The promotion over more senior colonels caused an uproar among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson's gossiping seemed to indicate he was a participant in the Conway Cabal, a conspiracy to replace George Washington with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was compelled to resign in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress appointed him clothier-general of the Army, but he resigned on March 27, 1781, due to his \\"lack of aptitude for the job\\". Kentucky ventures After his resignation from the Continental Army, Wilkinson reluctantly became a brigadier general in the Pennsylvania militia in 1782 and also a state assemblyman in 1783, due to the wishes of George Washington. He moved to Kentucky (at that time, just three counties still belonging to Virginia) in 1784, and he was active there in efforts to achieve independence from Virginia. In April 1787, Wilkinson made a highly controversial trip to New Orleans, which was the capital of Spanish colonial Louisiana. At that time, Americans were allowed to trade on the Mississippi River, but they had to pay a hefty tariff. Wilkinson met with Spanish Governor Esteban Rodr√≠guez Mir√≥ and managed to convince him to allow Kentucky to have a trading monopoly on the River; in return he promised to promote Spanish interests in the west.Buescher, John. \\"Trailing Lewis and Clark\\". Teachinghistory.org. Accessed 12 July 2011. On August 22, 1787, Wilkinson signed an expatriation declaration and swore allegiance to the King of Spain to satisfy his own commercial needs. The \\"Spanish Conspiracy\\", as it is known, was initiated by Wilkinson's \\"First Memorial\\", a 7,500-word report written before he left New Orleans for Charleston, to the Spanish concerning the \\"political future of western settlers\\" and to convince Spain to \\"admit us [Kentuckians] under protection as vassals\\". This was encoded with myriad symbols, numbers, and letters that was decoded via a complex English-Spanish cipher code-named \\"Number 13\\", which became the basis for his pseudonym, \\"Agent 13\\". Upon returning to Kentucky in February 1788, Wilkinson vigorously opposed the new U.S. Constitution. Kentucky had very nearly achieved statehood under the old Articles of Confederation, and there was widespread disappointment when this was delayed because of the new constitution. Leading up to Kentucky's seventh convention regarding separation from Virginia in November 1788, Wilkinson attempted to gauge the support for Kentucky to seek union with Spain. Wilkinson's ability to win people over with his charm and sincerity got him elected committee chairman at the convention. He advocated for Kentucky to seek independence from Virginia first, and then to consider joining the Union of states as a second step. For many, joining the Union was conditional upon the Union negotiating with Spain to arrange free navigation on the Mississippi River, a contentious point which many doubted the eastern states would act upon. Unable to gather enough support for his position at the convention, Wilkinson then approached Mir√≥ with a proposal. His intention was to obtain a grant of 60,000 acres (243 km¬≤) in the Yazoo lands, at the junction of the Yazoo River and the Mississippi (near present-day Vicksburg). The land was to serve as payment for Wilkinson's efforts on behalf of Spain, and to serve as a refuge in the event he and his supporters had to flee from the United States. Wilkinson asked for and received a pension of $7,000 from Mir√≥, while requesting pensions on behalf of several prominent Kentuckians, including: Harry Innes, Benjamin Sebastian, John Brown, Caleb Wallace, Benjamin Logan, Isaac Shelby, George Muter, George Nicholas, and even Humphrey Marshall (who at one time was a bitter rival of Wilkinson's). However, by 1788 Wilkinson had apparently lost the confidence of officials in Spain. Mir√≥ was not to grant any of the proposed pensions and was forbidden from giving money to support a revolution in Kentucky. Furthermore, Wilkinson continued to secretly receive funds from Spain for many years. Second military career In the Northwest Indian War, Colonel Wilkinson led a force of Kentucky volunteers against American Indians at Ouiatenon in May 1791. He commanded a follow-up raid that autumn, highlighted by the Battle of Kenapacomaqua. In October he received a commission in the U.S. Army as lieutenant colonel, commandant of the 2nd U.S. Infantry. =Rivalry with Wayne= When the United States government reorganized the Army as the Legion of the United States, President George Washington was faced with the decision of whom to name as its commanding general. The two major candidates for this promotion were Wilkinson and Anthony Wayne. In the end, the cabinet chose Wayne due to Wilkinson's suspected involvement with the Spanish government. The cabinet promoted Wilkinson to brigadier general as consolation, since the President was aware of Wilkinson's fragile ego. Wilkinson developed a jealousy of Wayne, but he maintained an ostensible respect toward the general. However, upon Wilkinson's refusal of an invitation to Wayne's Christmas party, Wayne developed a full- fledged hatred for Wilkinson, deeming the refusal to be an act of disrespect. For example, Wayne had led the Legion Army against the Native Americans in the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794. This battle was a huge victory for the United States, yet Wilkinson had criticized General Wayne's actions during the battle, simply to antagonize him. Wilkinson proceeded to file formal complaints with President Washington, against Wayne and his decisions. Upon finding out about the complaints against him, Wayne decided to fight back, launching an investigation into Wilkinson's history with the Spanish. During all of this time, Wilkinson had renewed his secret alliance with the Spanish government (through the Governor of Louisiana Francisco Luis H√©ctor de Carondelet), alerting them to the actions of both the US and the French occupancy in North America. When Spanish couriers were intercepted carrying payments for Wilkinson, Wayne's suspicions were confirmed and he attempted to court martial Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead Wilkinson began his first tenure as Senior Officer of the Army, which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to them in return for large sums in gold, but most of his information was of little value.Nelson, 1999 =Quasi-War with France= Wilkinson was transferred to the southern frontier in 1798. During the Quasi-War crisis of the late 1790s between France and the United States, he was given the third-place rank in the U.S. Army behind George Washington (who, having been succeeded as President by Adams, died in December 1799) and Alexander Hamilton. Among other duties, Wilkinson was charged by Hamilton with establishing a \\"Reserve Corps\\" of American troops in the lower Ohio River Valley, who would seize the lower Mississippi River Valley and New Orleans in the event of war with France and her ally Spain. Despite the end of the crisis in mid-1800 and Hamilton being discharged from the Army, Wilkinson, for unknown reasons, continued the plan for the establishment of the base which he named \\"Cantonment Wilkinson\\" after himself. Located in the Indiana Territory (now southern Illinois), the base operated from January 1801 to late 1802 before finally being abandoned. Archaeologists from Southern Illinois University have located the remains of this base, which is producing much previously-unknown information and artifacts from the daily life of the frontier army.\\"Ohio River Valley Forts: Cantonment Wilkinsonville\\", Southernmost Illinois History Wilkinson served his second, longer term as Senior Officer of the Army from June 15, 1800, until January 27, 1812, when former Secretary of War Henry Dearborn was promoted to major general over Wilkinson. =Service under President Jefferson= Wilkinson remained senior officer of the United States Army under President Thomas Jefferson. Along with Governor William C. C. Claiborne, Wilkinson shared the honor of taking possession of the Louisiana Purchase on behalf of the United States in 1803. At this time, Wilkinson renewed his treasonous relationship with Spanish colonial officials, offering advice to them on how to contain American expansion in exchange for the restoration of his pension. Among other things, Wilkinson tipped off the Spanish to the object of the Lewis and Clark expedition and provided advice to the Marquess of Casa Calvo to aid in his negotiations over the Texas‚ÄìLouisiana border. =Connections with Aaron Burr= In 1804‚Äì05, he met in person with Aaron Burr and they exchanged letters regarding Burr's conspiracy. After Burr's arrest he claimed he was leading a group of settlers to take up residence on land in Texas which he had leased from the Spanish government in Mexico. The government charged him with treason and claimed he intended to separate the then-western states and territories from the United States and establish an independent nation. Wilkinson was both the senior brigadier general of the United States Army and the first Governor of Louisiana Territory, which made him someone whose support Burr would cultivate. In 1806 Burr is supposed to have sent a coded, unsigned letter (the \\"Cipher Letter\\", which Burr later denied having written) to Wilkinson, which stated that he was ready to commence his movement to Texas. Burr's subsequent efforts to recruit participants in his plans became public, raising fears that he was conspiring with England to start a war with Spain. Wilkinson became fearful that his role in Burr's plans and/or his spying for Spain would be exposed. In October 1806 Wilkinson sent to President Jefferson a letter in which he painted Burr's actions in the worst possible light, while portraying himself as innocent of any involvement. Jefferson ordered Burr's arrest, and Burr was apprehended near Natchez, Mississippi. Wilkinson testified at Burr's trial, and the documents presented as evidence included the \\"cipher letter\\", which Wilkinson had given the prosecution. However the letter was clearly altered to minimize Wilkinson's culpability. This forgery, coupled with Wilkinson's obviously self-serving testimony, had the effect of making Burr seem to be the victim of an overzealous government. The grand jury nearly produced enough votes in favor of indicting Wilkinson for misprision of treason, and foreman John Randolph said of Wilkinson that he was a \\"mammoth of iniquity\\", the \\"most finished scoundrel\\", and \\"the only man I ever saw who was from the bark to the very core a villain.\\" During Burr's trial, Wilkinson placed New Orleans under martial law, against the will of Governor Claiborne,https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Wilkinson and imprisoned several people whom he thought may be able to connect him to Burr, along with attorneys who tried to defend them.https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/founding-traitor/ He was removed from the Territorial Governor's office after being publicly criticized for heavy-handed administration and abuse of power (and replaced with Meriwether Lewis). In addition, his actions around the Burr conspiracy became public, which aroused the public against him and led to two Congressional inquiries into his private ventures and intrigues. President James Madison, who had succeeded Jefferson in 1809, ordered a military court of inquiry in 1811, which resulted in a court-martial that exonerated Wilkinson. =War of 1812= Wilkinson was commissioned a major general during the War of 1812 on March 2, 1813. That same month, Wilkinson led the American force which occupied Mobile in Spanish West Florida, effectively implementing the inclusion of the Mobile District in the Mississippi Territory. He was then assigned to the St. Lawrence River theater of war, following Henry Dearborn's reassignment. Wilkinson engaged in two failed campaigns (the Battle of Crysler's Farm and the second Battle of Lacolle Mills). He was then relieved from active duty, but he was cleared in a military inquiry. He was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815. In 1816, Wilkinson published Memoirs of My Own Times, in a final attempt to clear his name. Last years After the end of his military career, Wilkinson was appointed as U.S. Envoy to Mexico. This was during the period of the Mexican War of Independence against Spain, which was won in 1821. In that year, Wilkinson requested a Texas land grant. While awaiting the Mexican government's approval of his land scheme, Wilkinson died in Mexico City on December 28, 1825, at the age of 68. He was buried in Mexico City. Wilkinson's involvement with the Spanish (as Agent 13) was widely suspected in his own day, but it was not proven until 1854, with Louisiana historian Charles Gayarr√©'s publication of the American general's correspondence with Esteban Rodr√≠guez Mir√≥, Louisiana's colonial governor between 1785 and 1791. Other historians subsequently added to the catalog of Wilkinson's treasonous activities. Later view Some 65 years after the general's misdeeds, then-Governor of New York Theodore Roosevelt condemned him in print: \\"In all our history, there is no more despicable character.\\" Historian Robert Leckie characterized him as \\"a general who never won a battle or lost a court-martial\\", while Frederick Jackson Turner called Wilkinson \\"the most consummate artist in treason that the nation ever possessed\\". George Rogers Clark biographer Temple Bodley said of Wilkinson, \\"He had considerable military talent, but used it only for his own gain.\\" Legacy * Frankfort, Kentucky's downtown was created from land owned by Wilkinson, and he designed the layout. A major street, which runs along historic Liberty Hall, was named Wilkinson Street.Frankfort.ky.gov * New Orleans has a short street called Wilkinson named for James Wilkinson, in the French Quarter near Jackson Square. There is also a Wilkinson Street in Mandeville, Louisiana. Many of the oldest streets in Mandeville, close to Lake Pontchartrain, are named after prominent New Orleans residents of the late 18th and early 19th centuries or for Battle of New Orleans heroes. * Wilkinson County, Georgia, is named for Wilkinson. A Georgia historical marker on the courthouse square gives a brief biography of the general and identifies him as the source of the county's name. (The entry on the county in the usually reliable reference Georgia Place Names, by the late Kenneth Krakow, confuses James Wilkinson with James Marion Wilkinson, a Valdosta, Georgia, politician and railroad executive, but the latter Wilkinson was born decades after the county was founded.) * Wilkinson County, Mississippi, is named for General Wilkinson as well. It was there in the Old Natchez District that Wilkinson spent much of his time, allegedly plotting the Burr Conspiracy; Fort Adams (then an important U.S. Army post) was constructed by Wilkinson as the most southwesterly point in the U.S. and the last American stop on the Mississippi River before entering Spanish territory. * Wilkinson was an avid supporter of the military's short-hair codes. He attempted to prosecute Colonel Thomas Butler, a veteran of both the Revolution and the Indian wars, for keeping his long hair. Colonel Butler died before the trials closed. He never did cut his long, braided queue prior to his death and a possibly apocryphal story tells that his last request was for a hole to be drilled in his casket so that the queue could hang out and taunt Wilkinson even in death.Hickey, Donald R. \\"The United States Army Versus Long Hair: The Trials of Colonel Thomas Butler, 1801‚Äì1805\\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 101 (October 1977): 462‚Äì74 (in print F146.

More than 120 million copies of McGuffey Readers were sold between 1836 and 1960, placing its sales in a category with the Bible and Webster's Dictionary.  Early years  Greersburg Academy William Holmes McGuffey was born the son of Alexander and Anna (Holmes) McGuffey near Claysville in West Finley Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, which is 45 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. In 1802 the McGuffey family moved farther out into the frontier at Tuscarawas County, Ohio. He attended country school, and after receiving special instruction at Youngstown, he attended Greersburg Academy in Darlington, Pennsylvania. Afterwards, he attended and graduated from Pennsylvania's Washington College, where he became an instructor. He was a roving instructor, traveling through the frontier of Ohio, Kentucky, and western Pennsylvania. He was \\"one of an army of half-educated young men who tramped the roads and trails drumming up 'subscription scholars'.\\" These half-educated young men would travel to and from different settlements looking for a part-time teaching job. They would teach in log-cabins to children whose parents would pay for their education. The teachers would educate the children until the parents ran out of funding or until the parents did not care to have their children educated anymore. One of the small settlements where he taught was Poland, Ohio. He was close friends with Washington College's President Andrew Wylie and lived in Wylie's house for a time; they often would walk the 3 miles to Washington College together.  Career and life  McGuffey's house in Oxford, Ohio McGuffey left Washington College in 1826 to become a professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. A year later, in 1827, he was married to Harriet Spinning of Dayton, Ohio, with whom he had five children. In 1829 he was ordained at Bethel Chapel as a minister in the Presbyterian Church. It was in Oxford that he created the most important contribution of his life: The McGuffey Readers. His books sold over 122 million copies. He was very fond of teaching children as he geared the books toward a younger audience. His home in Oxford is a museum and National Historic Landmark. In 1836 he left Miami to become president of Cincinnati College, where he also served as a distinguished teacher and lecturer. He left Cincinnati in 1839 to become the 4th president of Ohio University, which he left in 1843 to become president of what was then called the Woodward Free Grammar School in Cincinnati, one of the country's earliest public schools.

In 1845 McGuffey moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he became Professor of Philosophy at the University of Virginia. A year after his first wife Harriet died in 1850, he married Miss Laura Howard, daughter of Dean Howard of the University of Virginia. McGuffey is buried in the University of Virginia Cemetery, in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Legacy  McGuffey Hall at Ohio University, named for William McGuffey McGuffey High School in Claysville, PA :The William H. McGuffey Primary Schoolin Charlottesville, VA bears his name. The historic building is currently an artist-run cooperative arts center, currently known as the McGuffey Art Center. Ohio University's Department of University Advancement is housed in a building named McGuffey Hall. At Miami University, McGuffey Hall is a large academic building home to several education-related departments, including the College of Education, Health, and Society and the Teacher Education and Educational Leadership departments. The university ran the McGuffey Laboratory School from 1910 until 1983 on its campus. When the school closed, some of the parents started The William Holmes McGuffey School Foundation which operates an independent progressive school in Oxford called the McGuffey Foundation School. The school was later renamed the McGuffey Montessori School. The McGuffey School District in Washington County, Pennsylvania is named for William Holmes McGuffey. The industrialist Henry Ford cited McGuffey Readers as one of his most important childhood influences. In 1934 he had the log cabin where McGuffey was born moved to Greenfield Village, Ford's museum of Americana at Dearborn, Michigan. In 1998 the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker at McGuffey High School/Middle School noting McGuffey's historic importance. =McGuffey Awards= Named for William Holmes McGuffey's influential primers that first appeared in 1836 and remained in print until 1921, the McGuffey longevity awards recognize long-lived, still-in-use textbooks of excellence.TAA, William Holmes McGuffey Longevity Awards, The Text and Academic Authors Association created the McGuffy longevity award in 1993 for recognition of texts and learning materials that have seen long and continued use in education for more than 15 years.

His work spans a variety of forms and genres, including novels, essays, children's books, screenplays, theatre and comics. His novel Texaco was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1992. Biography Chamoiseau was born on 3 December 1953 in Fort-de-France, Martinique, where he resides. After he studied law in Paris he returned to Martinique inspired by √âdouard Glissant to take a close interest in Creole culture. In 1981, he was the co-author, with Georges Puisy, of a historical work on the Antilles under the reign of Napol√©on Bonaparte, Delgr√®s : les Antilles sous Bonaparte. In 1989, he was the co-author of √âloge de la cr√©olit√© (In Praise of Creoleness) with Jean Bernab√© and Rapha√´l Confiant. Chamoiseau has received a number of awards. In 1990, he received the Prix Carbet for Antan d'enfance, the first book in an autobiographical trilogy collectively titled Une enfance cr√©ole. His 1992 novel Texaco has been described as \\"a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth and Cesaire's Return to My Native Land.\\"Zvomuya, Percy, Refuge for the wretched, Mail & Guardian, 24 August 2012. In 1999, Chamoiseau was honoured with a Prince Claus Award for his contribution to Caribbean society. Chamoiseau's writing style has sometimes been compared to that of Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, for the way in which they explore the relationship between the written and the oral.  Writing style and approach  = Masculinity versus femininity = The dynamics and relationship between men and women has been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean. The concept of \\"masculinity\\" versus \\"femininity\\" is a literary theme that is indicative of Caribbean literature. Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works. However, as there are a larger number of male writer that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven, and takes the \\"masculinist\\" perspective. Chamoiseau has often been criticized as being a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Cr√©olit√© movement in the Antilles archipelago. The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers. The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. However, his literary work in the children's story \\"Kosto et ses deux enfants\\" (from √âmerveilles) is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature. The representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; in the story, this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure. = Cr√©olit√© = A question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is: \\"What does it mean to be Caribbean?\\" This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is \\"Creoleness\\". Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend together on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers. This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of \\"Americanness\\" in that it existed prior to America, and that \\"Americanness\\" excludes it interaction with the indigenous population. This relates to Patrick Chamoiseau's writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness. Creole Folktales is a prime example from his works. The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral. Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.

Deborah told Barak that God commanded him to lead an attack against the forces of Jabin king of Canaan and his military commander Sisera (Judges 4:6‚Äì7); the entire narrative is recounted in chapter 4. Judges chapter 5 gives the same story in poetic form. This passage, often called The Song of Deborah, may date to as early as the twelfth century BC, and is perhaps the earliest sample of Hebrew poetry.  In the Bible  In the Book of Judges, it is stated that Deborah was a prophet, a judge of Israel and the wife of Lapidoth.\\"Deborah\\", Jewish Encyclopedia. She rendered her judgments beneath a date palm tree between Ramah in Benjamin and Bethel in the land of Ephraim. The people of Israel had been oppressed by Jabin, the king of Canaan, whose capital was Hazor, for twenty years. Stirred by the wretched condition of Israel she sends a message to Barak, the son of Abinoam, at Kedesh of Naphtali, and tells him that the Lord God had commanded him to muster ten thousand troops of Naphtali and Zebulun and concentrate them upon Mount Tabor, the mountain at the northern angle of the great plain of Esdraelon. At the same time she states that the Lord God of Israel will draw Sisera, commander of Jabin's army, to the River Kishon. Barak declines to go without the prophet. Deborah consents, but declares that the glory of the victory will therefore belong to a woman. As soon as the news of the rebellion reaches Sisera he collects nine hundred chariots of iron and a host of people. Then Deborah said, according to : As Deborah prophesied, a battle is fought (led by Barak), and Sisera is completely defeated. He himself escapes on foot, while his army is pursued as far as Harosheth of the Gentiles and destroyed. Sisera comes to the tent of Jael; and he lies down to rest. He asks for a drink; she gives him milk; and while he is asleep she hammers a tent-pin through his temple. The Biblical account of Deborah ends with the statement that after the battle, there was peace in the land for 40 years (). = The Song of Deborah = Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours (1865) The Song of Deborah is found in Judges 5:2‚Äì31 and is a victory hymn, sung by Deborah and Barak, about the defeat of Canaanite adversaries by some of the tribes of Israel. Biblical scholars generally identified the Song as one of the oldest parts of the Bible, dating somewhere in the 12th century BC, based on its grammar and context.Coogan, Michael D. (2009), A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context, Oxford University Press, p. 180. However, some critics have recently argued that the song's language and content indicate that it was written no earlier than the 7th century BC. The song itself differs slightly from the events described in Judges 4. The song mentions six participating tribes (Ephraim, Benjamin, Machir, Zebulun, Issachar, and Naphtali) as opposed to the two tribes in Judges 4:6 (Naphtali and Zebulun) and does not mention the role of Jabin.Nelson, Richard (2006). \\"Judges\\". The Harper Collins Study Bible, rev. ed. Eds. Attridge, Harold & Wayne Meeks. New York: HarperCollins, p. 353. Though it is not uncommon to read a victory hymn in the Hebrew Bible, the Song of Deborah stands out as unique in that it is a hymn that celebrates a military victory helped by two women: Deborah and Jael. Michael Coogan writes that Jael being a woman \\"is a further sign that Yahweh ultimately is responsible for the victory: the mighty Canaanite general Sisera will be 'sold' by the Lord 'into the hand of a woman (Judges 4:9). Traditional chronology Traditional Jewish chronology places Deborah's 40 years of judging Israel () from 1107 BC until her death in 1067 BC. Jewish History: Deborah the Prophetess, Chabad. The Dictionary of World Biography: The Ancient World claims that she might have lived in the period between 1200 BC to 1124 BC. Based on archaeological findings, different biblical scholars have argued that Deborah's war with Sisera best fits the context of either the second half of the 12th century BC or the second half of the 11th century BC.

At the time, the band was then named \\"A New Found Glory\\", but later dropped the indefinite article \\"A\\" due to some fans struggling to find their records in stores. The original pressings of the album contained samplings from several films including The Outsiders (1983), Weird Science (1985), and That Thing You Do! (1996), as well as Robert Frost's poem \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\", after which the album is named. On the strength of the release, Richard Reines, co-founder of Drive-Thru Records, signed the band after paying Eulogy a $5,000 license fee in order to re-release the album on October 19, 1999. Propelled by debut single \\"Hit or Miss\\", Nothing Gold Can Stay garnered a cult following and sold in excess of 300,000 copies. The record was responsible for breaking the band in the United States and has been noted for its influence on contemporary pop punk music. Background and recording Following the band's underground success with the release of debut EP It's All About the Girls (1997), they soon caught the attention of independent label Eulogy Recordings, and the quintet subsequently signed in order to increase distribution of their music. The album was recorded on a low budget with the members having to self-fund the sessions. Jordan Pundik recalls, \\"I was working in Walgreens, I remember borrowing money off my sister to pay for the recording and everybody getting on me for not throwing in enough.\\" Chad Gilbert also said that the album \\"wasn't recorded too well\\", but also praised its rawness by adding, \\"It sounds more real than a lot of other records\\". Pundik worked alongside primary lyricist and rhythm guitarist Steve Klein to pen the tracks. \\"When me and Steve would work on the songs, he'd come and pick me up in his punk-rock station wagon, with stickers all over the back. It didn't have a stereo, just a boombox. We'd sit in his room at his parents' house, and we'd work on lyrics and melodies with sheets of paper everywhere\\". Pundik also said that a five-year relationship during high school inspired the lyrics to \\"Winter of '95\\". \\"I was with her for 5 years, she was the only thing I knew, so that played a big part. I remember listening to a Gameface record on vinyl, but was writing my own lyrics for the song at the same time in my head\\". Gilbert reflects on the album as \\"100 percent, without a doubt, the most honest, simple, pure record. We were just a bunch of kids who grew up in the suburbs. We never expected to leave Florida, we were just making a record we could play locally and sell to friends. Then, eventually, it took us so many other places\\". Reception and legacy Upon release in 1999, Nothing Gold Can Stay received positive reviews. Mike DaRonco of AllMusic gave the album a positive four star review. He wrote, \\"With an abundance of Lifetime/Promise Ring rip-off bands crawling out from under every suburban nook and cranny, A New Found Glory pull out all the right hooks and harmonies. Reminiscing about the days of walking to the beach, holding hands with a loved one and loudly singing Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". But, they're also about trying to pick up the pieces of a shattered relationship by writing a song about it. Just sit back, listen, and relate to their heartfelt days of love lost and found.\\" Michael Dabaie of College Music Journal awarded the album a \\"super\\" four-star rating. Describing the sound as \\"abrasive yet extremely catchy\\" he also opined that the album was \\"pop-punk with substance and a stiff backbone.\\" A decade after the album's release, Brendan Manley of Alternative Press covered the album in two separate articles for the magazine. Discussing the album in the \\"10 Classic Albums of '99\\" feature, he wrote, \\"Like its title implies, Nothing Gold Can Stay is the sonic transcript of a glorious, fleeting time for NFG, and for pop-punk. But just as gold never loses its luster, it's only fitting that 10 years later, Nothing Gold Can Stay still shines\\". Later, during a separate article covering the band's history, Manley noted their lasting influence on modern pop-punk music; \\"New Found Glory are still at the forefront of the scene they helped create\\". Gabe Saporta of Midtown also said of Nothing Gold Can Stay; \\"The record has so many little quirks - so many things that made you feel like [NFG] were friends of yours, who were fucking around in the studio and happened to create something magical\\". Also, when Jared Logan was producing Fall Out Boy's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by \\"handing over the first two New Found Glory records\\". Track listing All lyrics written by Steve Klein and Jordan Pundik; music composed by New Found Glory.

A pitcher, Glavine played in Major League Baseball for the Atlanta Braves (1987‚Äì2002, 2008), and New York Mets (2003‚Äì2007). He was the MVP of the 1995 World Series as the Braves beat the Cleveland Indians. With 164 victories during the 1990s, Glavine earned the second highest number of wins as a pitcher in the National League, second only to teammate Greg Maddux's 176. He was a five-time 20-game winner and two-time Cy Young Award winner, and one of only 24 pitchers (and just 6 left-handers) in major league history to earn 300 career wins. On January 8, 2014, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving 91.9% of the votes cast. Glavine also played hockey. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, after scoring 47 goals and 47 assists in 23 high school games. Early years Glavine was born in Concord, Massachusetts and raised in Billerica, Massachusetts. Glavine attended Billerica Memorial High School, where he was an excellent student and a letterman in ice hockey as well as baseball. He was a four-year member of the honor roll and the National Honor Society. In hockey, as a senior, he was named the Merrimack Valley's Most Valuable Player. In baseball, he led his team to the Division I North Title and the Eastern Massachusetts Championship as a senior. Glavine graduated from high school in 1984 with honors. He was elected to the Billerica Memorial/Howe High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. Professional career Glavine was drafted by both the Los Angeles Kings in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft (in the 4th round, 69th overall‚Äîtwo rounds ahead of future National Hockey League star Brett Hull and five rounds ahead of Luc Robitaille, both 2009 Hockey Hall of Fame inductees), and the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball organization in the 2nd round of the 1984 amateur baseball draft. Glavine elected to play baseball and made his major league debut on August 17, 1987. =Atlanta Braves (1987‚Äì2002)= Glavine delivers a pitch in spring training, 1998 Glavine had mixed results during his first several years in the majors, compiling a 33‚Äì43 record from 1987 to 1990, including a 17-loss performance in 1988. His fortunes turned around in 1991, when he won 20 games and posted a 2.55 earned run average. It was his first of three consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins, and saw him earn his first National League Cy Young Award. Glavine was the ace of the 1991 Braves' starting rotation that included Steve Avery, Charlie Leibrandt, and another future NL Cy Young Award winner and Hall of Fame inductee, John Smoltz. His season helped ensure a dramatic reversal in the Braves' competitive fortunes as they won the National League pennant and earned a trip to the World Series, though they lost to the Minnesota Twins in seven games. In an era of the diminishing 20-game winner (there were none in the majors in 2006 and 2009), Glavine became the last major league pitcher to win 20 games in three straight years (1991‚Äì1993). Atlanta, long thought of as a perennial cellar dweller, was lifted in the 1990s into one of the most successful franchises in the game on the strength of its stellar pitching staff and solid hitting. After the Braves acquired Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs in 1993, Glavine, Maddux, and Smoltz formed one of the best pitching rotations in baseball history. Among them, they won seven Cy Young Awards during the period of 1991 to 1998. Glavine won his second Cy Young Award in 1998, going 20‚Äì6 with a 2.47 ERA. Years later, after Glavine joined the Mets and Maddux played for the San Diego Padres, the three (along with Smoltz who still pitched for Atlanta) all recorded wins on the same day, June 27, 2007. The Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in 6 games in the 1995 World Series, and Glavine was named the Series MVP. He won two games during that series: Game 2 and Game 6. In Game 6, he pitched eight innings of one-hit shutout baseball. In addition to the championship won with the Braves in 1995, he pitched in four other World Series with the team (in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1999) when the Braves lost to the Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays, and New York Yankees twice, respectively. =New York Mets (2003‚Äì2007)= In 2003, Glavine left Atlanta to play for the rival New York Mets, signing a four-year, $42.5 million deal. Glavine's performance had slumped in the second half of 2002 and he was ineffective in his two postseason starts, so Atlanta refused to guarantee a third year on his contract. Glavine struggled in his first year as a Met. For the first time since 1988, he failed to win 10 games, also posting his first losing record in that span, 9‚Äì14. He also allowed his first career grand slam, hit by Jos√© Vidro of the Expos on September 19. Glavine did get to enjoy a personal highlight at the end of the season, however, when the Mets called up his brother Mike to join the team. Glavine began 2004 well, highlighted by a May 23 one-hit shutout of the Colorado Rockies and selection to the National League All-Star team. However, he struggled again during a second half marred by losing front teeth in a car accident while riding in a taxicab. He went on to post a slightly better record, though still a losing one, going 11‚Äì14. He started off 2005 slowly, but rebounded after advice from pitching coach Rick Peterson, who encouraged Glavine to begin pitching inside more often (including a change up in) and incorporate a curveball in his repertoire. Glavine's turnaround helped him earn National League Pitcher of the Month in September. He finished the season with a 13‚Äì13 record and a respectable 3.53 ERA. The Mets' faith in Glavine was rewarded when he returned to his old form during the 2006 season. He finished one victory shy of the NL lead in wins and was selected to the All-Star team. That season Tom Glavine became the first Mets left-hander in nearly 30 years to start at least thirty games in four consecutive seasons. Glavine and the Mets got a scare in August 2006. His pitching shoulder was tested for a blood clot because he was suffering from coldness in his left ring finger. This was originally thought to be a symptom of Raynaud's syndrome, which had been diagnosed in 1990. According to the pitcher, \\"Doctors... picked something up when they did the ultrasound.\\" The results of that new test showed the problem could be treated with medicine, and Glavine resumed pitching on September 1, against the Houston Astros. Glavine finished the 2006 season with a fine 15‚Äì7 record and a 3.82 ERA, as the Mets won the National League Eastern Division, allowing him to make his first playoff appearance since leaving the Braves. He started Game 2 of the Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching six shutout innings and surrendering only four hits to pick up the win, as the Mets went on to sweep the series from the Dodgers. He then started Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching seven shutout innings to pick up the win, helped by Carlos Beltr√°n's two-run home run. Glavine's postseason scoreless innings streak ended in his next start. He suffered the loss in Game 5 while the Mets went on to drop the series to the Cardinals in seven games. Glavine re-signed with the Mets for the 2007 season, needing only 10 wins to reach 300 wins for his career. He started his fourth Opening Day game as a Met in the 2007 season. On August 5, 2007, Glavine won his 300th game, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. In the game, he also was 1 for 2 with a run batted in and a walk. He pitched 6‚Öì innings and won 8‚Äì3, bringing his lifetime record to 300‚Äì197. Glavine is the 23rd pitcher to win 300 games, and the fifth left- handed pitcher to do so, joining Eddie Plank, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Steve Carlton. (Randy Johnson won his 300th game on June 4, 2009, becoming the 24th pitcher and 6th left-hander to do so). On September 30, 2007, Glavine started the final game of the Mets' 2007 regular season against the Florida Marlins. The Mets, tied with the Philadelphia Phillies, needed a win to either win the division or force a playoff game with the Phillies for the division. Unfortunately, Glavine made one of the worst starts of his career, allowing seven runs while recording only one out, with the Mets being eliminated from playoff contention with an 8‚Äì1 loss.Box Score Florida @ New York Mets September 30, 2007 Retrieved July 18, 2010 Glavine declined a one-year, $13 million contract option for the 2008 season with the Mets on October 5, 2007, ending his time as a New York Met. However, he did collect a $3 million buyout when he declined the $13 million option. =Return to Atlanta Braves (2008)= Glavine being introduced at Turner Field in his first game back with the Braves in 2008 On November 18, 2007, Glavine rejoined the Braves, seemingly bringing his career full circle, with a 1-year contract worth $8 million. On April 18, 2008, Glavine was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his 22-year career. On May 14, 2008, Glavine won his first game with the Atlanta Braves since September 19, 2002. This was also his 304th win, and it occurred while the Atlanta Braves were playing against the Philadelphia Phillies. Coincidentally, both his win on September 19, 2002 and May 14, 2008, were against the Phillies. On August 14, 2008, Glavine appeared in his final game. He started against the Chicago Cubs, and he gave up 7 runs in only 4 innings. A few days later, he was placed on the disabled list because of a recurring shoulder injury. On February 19, 2009, Glavine agreed to return to Atlanta by signing a $1 million, one-year contract that included another $3.5 million in possible bonuses based on roster time.Glavine returning to Braves. Retrieved on February 20, 2009. However, the Braves released Glavine on June 3, 2009, as he was completing his rehab assignment. On June 20, Glavine announced he wouldn't pitch for the rest of the season. On February 11, 2010, he officially retired from the sport, having strongly hinted at that decision throughout the past few months. On the date of his retirement, Glavine agreed to take a job as a special assistant to Braves president John Schuerholz starting in the 2010 season. He would also serve as a guest analyst for some Braves games on SportSouth and Fox Sports South. The Braves retired Glavine's # 47 on August 6, 2010. Pitching style Glavine with the Atlanta Braves in 1993. Glavine, a left-hander, gradually lost velocity over the latter part of his career. Even at the end of his career, he was an effective starting pitcher in the National League due to his excellent control and deception, switching speeds, and locating pitches off the outside corner of the strike zone. His most common approach was to begin by locating his circle changeup off the outside corner, then follow with alternating fastballs and changeups to confuse the hitter. While batters frequently made contact with his pitches, the substantial movement he placed on them made drives very soft, resulting in easily fielded ground balls and fly outs. Glavine's consistency was also highlighted by his durability; since his first full year in 1988, he started at least 25 games every year and was never placed on the disabled list until his final season‚Äîat age 42. In addition to his excellent changeup and well- controlled fastball, Glavine had a plus-curve ball, a slider, and a tailing two-seam fastball. Despite being a left-handed pitcher, Glavine was often more effective against right-handed batters. Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully noted that this attribute was likely due to Glavine pitching from the extreme right edge of the pitching rubber. Like longtime Atlanta teammate Greg Maddux, Glavine was one of the better-hitting pitchers of his generation. He had a career .186 batting average‚Äîdecent for a modern pitcher‚Äîand hit over .200 in nine seasons, with a career best of .289 in 1996. He had a good eye, drawing a high number of walks (for a pitcher), which combined with his hits have given him a career on-base percentage of .244. Because Glavine got on base almost a quarter of the time he came at bat, opposing pitchers were never able to treat him as an automatic out in the lineup. In 2004, Glavine walked as often as he struck out (10 times each). Glavine's 201 sacrifice bunts prior to 2007 ranked second among active players at the time, only behind Omar Vizquel. Glavine won four Silver Slugger Awards, ranking him second all-time for pitchers behind Mike Hampton, while being the most among Cy Young Award Winners and Hall of Famer pitchers. Players' union representative Starting in 1991, Tom Glavine served as the Atlanta Braves team representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association, succeeding former NL Most Valuable Player and Braves icon Dale Murphy in the position. Prior to and during the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike, Tom Glavine was heavily involved in negotiations between the union and team owners and was frequently interviewed and quoted in the press about the talks. Ultimately, the strike caused the cancellation of the 1994 World Series and lasted 7¬Ω months. When play resumed in 1995, Glavine was frequently booed by Braves fans for his role in the players' union and was criticized for it in the local Atlanta press. Personal life Glavine signs autographs for fans in 2014 In 2005, along with several Mets teammates, Glavine served as a spokesman for Volunteers of America's \\"Operation Backpack\\" program. The program helped equip over 7,000 homeless school children with backpacks full of necessary school supplies. An additional 3,000 back packs were sent to Houston to help Katrina victims. In 2007, Glavine supported the Rally Foundation through the Money in the Mitt 300 Challenge to support childhood cancer care by selling Vineyard Vines Rally Ties to commemorate his historic 300th win in an effort to raise $300,000. 300 signed ties were to be sold for $1,000 each. In 2008, Glavine released a charity wine called \\"Cabernet Glavingnon\\" to raise funds for CURE Childhood Cancer, an organization founded to help conquer childhood cancer through research, education and support of patients and their families. Since 1992, Glavine has partnered with the Georgia Transplant Foundation to host the annual \\"Spring training\\" event, raising more than $4.3 million for transplant candidates, recipients, and their families, in the state of Georgia Glavine and his wife Christine have five children. One of their sons, Peyton, was selected in the 2017 MLB draft and is committed to attend Auburn University on a baseball scholarship. They live in Johns Creek, Georgia, and Glavine coaches his sons' baseball and hockey teams. Glavine is a Roman Catholic and has done a recorded piece for Catholic Athletes for Christ. Glavine is known for being humble about his accomplishments and an avid golfer, so a good friend, Jack Kennedy, gifted Glavine six dozen golf balls that display his uniform number, 47, on one side and the number of losses he had in his career on the other, 203. The gift was given around the time Glavine received the phone call that he would be a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee.

Name and etymology The name of the city is usually spelled Essaouira in Latin script, and ÿßŸÑÿµŸàŸäÿ±ÿ© in Arabic script. Both spellings represent its name in Moroccan Arabic, ·π£-·π¢wi·πõa. This is the diminutiveOn the formation of diminutive nouns in Moroccan Arabic, see R.S. Harrell, A short reference grammar of Moroccan Arabic (Washington, D.C., 1962), p. 81. (with definite article) of the noun ·π£u·πõ which means \\"wall (as round a yard, city), rampart\\".See T. Fox and M. Abu- Talib, A Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic (Washington, D.C., 1966), p. 148. The pronunciation with pharyngealized /·π£/ and /·πõ/ is a typically Moroccan development. In Classical Arabic, the noun is s≈´r (with plain /s/ and /r/), diminutive suwayrah.The form s≈´r, with plain /s/, is the only form cited in all dictionaries of Classical Arabic. Hence, the spelling of the name in Arabic script according to the classical pronunciation is ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàŸäÿ±ÿ© al-Suwayrah (with sƒ´n not ·π£ƒÅd). In the Berber language, which is spoken by a sizeable proportion of the city's inhabitants, it is called \\"Ta·π£·π£ort\\", meaning 'the small fortress'. In Moroccan Arabic, a single male inhabitant is called ·π£wi·πõi, plural ·π£wi·πõiyin, a single female inhabitant is ·π£wi·πõiya, plural ·π£wi·πõiyat. In the Berber language, a single male inhabitant is U-Ta·π£·π£ort, plural: Ayt Ta·π£·π£o·πõt, a single female inhabitant is Ult Ta·π£·π£ort, plural Ist Ta·π£·π£ort. Until the 1960s, Essaouira was generally known by its Portuguese name, Mogador. This name is probably a corruption of the older Berber name Amegdul ÿ£ŸÖŸÇÿØŸàŸÑ, which is mentioned by the 11th-century geographer al-Bakrƒ´.Mac Guckin de Slane (ed. and transl.), Description de l'Afrique septentrionale par el-Bekri (Alger 1913), Arabic text p. 86 ŸÖÿ±ÿ≥Ÿâ ÿßŸÖŸÇÿØŸàŸÑ mars√° Ameqd≈´l \\"the port of Ameqd≈´l\\", translation p. 175 Amegdoul (Amegdul), with footnote: \\"Le tombeau ou chapelle de S√Ædi Megdoul est situ√© tout aupr√®s de Mogador; ce dernier est une alt√©ration de Megdoul\\". History Archaeological research shows that Essaouira has been occupied since prehistoric times. The bay at Essaouira is partially sheltered by the island of Mogador, making it a peaceful harbor protected against strong marine winds. =Antiquity= Essaouira has long been considered as one of the best anchorages of the Moroccan coast. The Carthaginian navigator Hanno visited in the 5th century BC and established the trading post of Arambys. Around the end of the 1st century BCE or early 1st century CE, the Berber king Juba II established a Tyrian purple factory, processing the murex and purpura shells found in the intertidal rocks at Essaouira and the Iles Purpuraires. This dye colored the purple stripe in the togas worn by the Senators of Imperial Rome. A Roman villa was excavated on Mogador island.Marokko Ingeborg Lehmann, Rita Henss p.243 A Roman vase was found as well as coinage from the 3rd century CE.

During the Middle Ages, a Muslim saint named Sidi Mogdoul was buried in Essaouira, probably giving its origin to the name \\"Mogador\\". Portuguese establishment (1506‚Äì10) In 1506, the king of Portugal, D. Manuel I, ordered a fortress to be built there, named Castelo Real de Mogador. Altogether, the Portuguese are documented to have seized six Moroccan towns and built six stand-alone fortresses on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, between the river Loukos in the north and the river of Sous in the south. Four of them only had a short duration: Graciosa (1489), S√£o Jo√£o da Mamora (1515), Castelo Real of Mogador (1506‚Äì10) and Aguz (1520‚Äì25). Two became permanent urban settlements: Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gu√© (modern Agadir, founded in 1505‚Äì06), and Mazagan, founded in 1514‚Äì17. Following the 1541 Fall of Agadir, the Portuguese had to abandon most of their settlements between 1541 and 1550, although they were able to keep Ceuta, Tangier and Mazagan.City walls: the urban enceinte in global perspective, James D. Tracy, p.352 The fortress of Castelo Real of Mogador fell to the local resistance of the Regraga fraternity four years after its establishment, in 1510. The Portuguese-built Castelo Real of Mogador was defended under Abd el-Malek II by a garrison of 100 Moroccans. It was drawn by Adriaen Matham in 1641. During the 16th century, powers including Spain, England, the Netherlands and France tried in vain to conquer the locality. Essaouira remained a haven for the export of sugar and molasses and as an anchorage for pirates.Notes to The History and Description of Africa and of the Notable Things Therein by Leo Africanus p.338 De Razilly expedition (1629) France was involved in an early attempt to colonize Mogador in 1629. As Richelieu and P√®re Joseph were attempting to establish a colonial policy, Admiral Isaac de Razilly suggested they occupy Mogador in 1626, which he had reconnoitered in 1619. The objective was to create a base against the Sultan of Marrakesh and asphyxiate the harbour of Safi. He departed for Sal√© on 20 July 1629 with a fleet composed of the ships Licorne, Saint-Louis, Griffon, Catherine, Hambourg, Sainte-Anne, Saint-Jean. He bombarded the city the Sal√©, destroyed three corsair ships, and then sent the Griffon under Captain Treillebois to Mogador. The men of Razilly saw the fortress of Castelo Real in Mogador and landed 100 men with wood and supplies on Mogador island, with the agreement of Richelieu. After a few days, however, the Griffon reembarked the colonists and departed to rejoin the fleet in Sal√©.E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913‚Äì1936, Volume 9 by Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, p.549 After these expeditions, France signed a treaty with Abd el-Malek II in 1631, giving France preferential treatment, known as \\"capitulations\\": preferential tariffs, the establishment of a Consulate, and freedom of religion for French subjects.France in the age of Louis XIII and Richelieu by Victor Lucien Tapi√© p.259 =Foundation of modern Essaouira (1760‚Äì70)= Map of Essaouira by Th√©odore Cornut.

The present city of Essaouira was built during the mid-eighteenth century by the Moroccan King. Mohammed III tried to reorient his kingdom toward the Atlantic for increased exchanges with European powers, choosing Mogador as his key location. One of his objectives was to establish a harbour at the closest possible point to Marrakesh.The Anglo American, Volume 3 by Alexander D. Paterson p.521 The other was to cut off trade from Agadir in the south, which had been favouring a political rival of Mohammed III, and the inhabitants of Agadir were forced to relocate to Essaouira. For 12 years, Mohammed III directed a French engineer, Th√©odore Cornut, and several other European architects and technicians to build the fortress and city along modern lines.Of Essaouira: \\"He employed European architects to design it, one a Frenchman said to be his prisoner, and the other an Englishman, converted to Islam and known as Ahmed el-Inglizi‚Äî otherwise Ahmed the Englishman.\\" in Morocco, Dorothy Hales Gary, Baron Patrick Balfour Kinross, Viking Press, 1971, p.35 Originally called \\"Souira\\" (\\"the small fortress\\"), the name became \\"Es-Saouira\\" (\\"the beautifully designed\\"). Th√©dore Cornut designed and built the city itself, particularly the Kasbah area, corresponding to the royal quarters and the buildings for Christian merchants and diplomats. Other parts were built by other architects, including Moroccan architects especially from Fez, Marrakesh, and Rabat. The harbour entrance, with the \\"Porte de la Marine\\", was built by an English renegade by the name of Ahmed el Inglizi (\\"Ahmed the English\\") or Ahmed El Alj (\\"Ahmed the Renegade\\"). Mohammed III took numerous steps to encourage the development of Essaouira including closing off the harbour of Agadir to the south in 1767 so that southern trade could be redirected through Essaouira. European communities in the northern harbour of Rabat-Sal√© were ordered to move to Essaouira through an ordinance of 21 January 1765. From the time of its rebuilding by Muhammad III until the end of the nineteenth century, Essaouira served as Morocco's principal port, offering the goods of the caravan trade to the world. The route brought goods from sub-Saharan Africa to Timbuktu, then through the desert and over the Atlas mountains to Marrakesh. The road from Marrakesh to Essaouira is a straight line, explaining the king's choice of this port among the many others along the Moroccan coast. File:Skala de Ville.jpgCity walls.

Mohammed III encouraged Moroccan Jews to settle in the town and handle the trade with Europe. Jews once comprised 40% of the population, and the Jewish quarter (or mellah) contains many old synagogues. The town also has a large Jewish cemetery. The city flourished until the caravan trade died, superseded by direct European shipping trade with sub-Saharan Africa.The Sultan's Jew: Morocco and the Sephardi World by Daniel J. Schroeter, pp. 17 ff Changes in trade, the founding of Israel, the resulting wars with Arab states, and the independence of Morocco all resulted in Sephardic Jews leaving the country. As of 2017, Essaouira had only three Jewish inhabitants. On 15 January 2020, King Mohammed VI visited \\"Bayt Dakira\\", a Jewish heritage house, in Essaouira.

Following Morocco's alliance with Algeria's Abd-El-Kader against France, Essaouira was bombarded and briefly occupied by the French Navy under the Prince de Joinville on 16 August 1844, in the Bombardment of Mogador, an important battle of the First Franco-Moroccan War. From 1912 to 1956, Essaouira was part of the French protectorate of Morocco. Mogador was used as a base for a military expedition against Dar Anflous, when 8,000 French troops were located outside the city under the orders of Generals Franchet d'Esperey and Brulard. The Kasbah of Dar Anflous was taken on 25 January 1913. In 1930, brothers, Michel and Jean Vieuchange used Essaouira as a base before Michel set off into the Western Sahara to try to find Smara. France had an important administrative, military and economic presence. Essaouira had a Franco-Moroccan school, still visible in Derb Dharb street. Linguistically, many Moroccans of Essaouira speak French fluently today. =Recent years= Bas relief of Orson Welles In the early 1950s film director and actor Orson Welles stayed at the Hotel des Iles just south of the town walls during the filming of his 1952 classic version of \\"Othello\\" which contains several memorable scenes shot in the labyrinthine streets and alleyways of the medina. Legend has it that during Welles' sojourn in the town he met Winston Churchill, another guest at the Hotel des Iles. A bas-relief of Orson Welles is located in a small square just outside the medina walls close to the sea. Several other film directors have utilized Essaouira as a location due to the photogenic and atmospheric qualities. Beginning in the late 1960s, Essaouira became something of a hippie hangout.

Newer international hotels have been built along the sea front ‚Äì the local planning regulations restrict buildings to 4 storeys high to help preserve the stunning views. There are also many privately owned riads, also known as dars, that may be rented on a daily or weekly basis. =Activities= The medina is home to many small arts and crafts businesses, notably cabinet making and 'thuya' wood-carving (using roots of the Tetraclinis tree), both of which have been practised in Essaouira for centuries. The fishing harbour, suffering from the competition of Agadir and Safi remains rather small, although the catches (sardines, conger eels) are surprisingly abundant due to the coastal upwelling generated by the powerful trade winds and the Canaries Current. Essaouira remains one of the major fishing harbours of Morocco. Essaouira is also renowned for its kitesurfing and windsurfing, with the powerful trade wind blowing almost constantly onto the protected, almost waveless, bay. Several world-class clubs rent top-notch material on a weekly basis. The township of Sidi Kaouki is located 25 km south of Essaouira and is becoming one of the best locations in Morocco for surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing. There are several businesses in Sidi Kaouki which offer gear rental. Essaouira is also a center of argan oil production. It has become a tourist attraction due to the tree-climbing goats who are unique to the region, as argan trees are the only type the goats climb.

In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent‚Äìchild relationship as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. \\"If only I could get rid of this dead weight ... Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.\\" In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed. \\"Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends\\", a kapo tells him. \\"Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.\\"; . Wiesel was 16 when Buchenwald was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945, too late for his father, who died after a beating while Wiesel lay silently on the bunk above for fear of being beaten too. He moved to Paris after the war and in 1954 completed an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish about his experiences, published in Argentina as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign (\\"And the World Remained Silent\\").; . The novelist Fran√ßois Mauriac helped him find a French publisher. Les √âditions de Minuit published 178 pages as La Nuit in 1958, and in 1960 Hill & Wang in New York published a 116-page translation as Night. Translated into 30 languages, the book ranks as one of the bedrocks of Holocaust literature. It remains unclear how much of Night is memoir. Wiesel called it his deposition, but scholars have had difficulty approaching it as an unvarnished account. The literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that the pruning of the text from Yiddish to French transformed an angry historical account into a work of art.Franklin, Ruth (23 March 2006). \\"A Thousand Darknesses\\". The New Republic. Night is the first in a trilogy‚ÄîNight, Dawn, Day‚Äîmarking Wiesel's transition during and after the Holocaust from darkness to light, according to the Jewish tradition of beginning a new day at nightfall. \\"In Night,\\" he said, \\"I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end‚Äîman, history, literature, religion, God. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with night.\\"; for the quote, , citing Morton A. Reichek (Spring 1976). \\"Elie Wiesel: Out of the Night\\". Present Tense, 46. Background Sighet, Transylvania, now Sighetu Marma»õiei, Romania, 2009 Elie Wiesel was born on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian mountains of northern Transylvania (now Romania), to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, n√©e Feig. The family lived in a community of 10,000‚Äì20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses at the beginning of the book, 1941‚Äì1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population. That changed at midnight on Sunday, 18 March 1944, with the invasion of Hungary by Nazi Germany, and the arrival in Budapest of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann to oversee the deportation of the country's Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. From 5 April, Jews over the age of six had to wear a 10 x 10 cm (3.8 x 3.8 in) yellow badge on the upper-left side of their coats or jackets. Jews had to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors could no longer be published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked. Sighetu Marma»õiei, Romania As the Allies prepared for the liberation of Europe, the mass deportations began at a rate of four trains a day from Hungary to Auschwitz, each train carrying around 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian Jews are recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival., citing Edmund Veesenmayer, Reich plenipotentiary in Hungary; . The transports comprised most of the Jewish population outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital. Between 16 May and 27 June, 131,641 Jews were deported from northern Transylvania.\\"Transylvania\\". Yad Vashem. Wiesel, his parents and sisters‚Äîolder sisters Hilda and Beatrice and seven-year-old Tzipora‚Äîwere among them. On arrival Jews were \\"selected\\" for the death or forced labour; to be sent to the left meant work, to the right, the gas chamber. Sarah and Tzipora were sent to the gas chamber. Hilda and Beatrice survived, separated from the rest of the family. Wiesel and Chlomo managed to stay together, surviving forced labour and a death march to another concentration camp, Buchenwald, near Weimar. Chlomo died there in January 1945, three months before the 6th Armored Division of the United States Army arrived to liberate the camp. Synopsis =Moshe the Beadle= Elie Wiesel, c. 1943, aged 15 Night opens in Sighet in 1941. The book's narrator is Eliezer, an Orthodox Jewish teenager who studies the Talmud by day, and by night \\"weep[s] over the destruction of the Temple\\". To the disapproval of his father, Eliezer spends time discussing the Kabbalah with Moshe the Beadle, caretaker of the Hasidic shtiebel (house of prayer). In June 1941 the Hungarian government expelled Jews unable to prove their citizenship. Moshe is crammed onto a cattle train and taken to Poland. He manages to escape, saved by God, he believes, so that he might save the Jews of Sighet. He returns to the village to tell what he calls the \\"story of his own death\\", running from one house to the next: \\"Jews, listen to me! It's all I ask of you. No money. No pity. Just listen to me!\\" When the train crossed into Poland, he tells them, it was taken over by the Gestapo, the German secret police. The Jews were transferred to trucks, then driven to a forest in Galicia, near Kolomay, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen, making Moshe Night's first unheeded witness.; . =Sighet ghettos= The Germans arrived in Sighet around 21 March 1944, and shortly after Passover (8‚Äì14 April that year) arrested the community leaders. Jews had to hand over their valuables, were not allowed to visit restaurants or leave home after six in the evening, and had to wear the yellow star at all times. Eliezer's father makes light of it: The yellow star? Oh well, what of it? You don't die of it ... (Poor Father! Of what then did you die?) Wiesel's father, Chlomo The SS transfer the Jews to one of two ghettos, each with its own council or Judenrat, which appoints Jewish police; there is also an office for social assistance, a labor committee, and a hygiene department. Eliezer's house, on a corner of Serpent Street, is in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family can stay in their home, although the windows on the non-ghetto side have to be boarded up. He is happy at first: \\"We should no longer have before our eyes those hostile faces, those hate-laden stares. ... The general opinion was that we were going to remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then everything would be as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto‚Äîit was illusion.\\"Night 1982, 9‚Äì10. In May 1944 the Judenrat is told the ghettos will be closed with immediate effect and the residents deported. Eliezer's family is moved at first to the smaller ghetto, but they are not told their final destination, only that they may each take a few personal belongings. The Hungarian police, wielding truncheons and rifle butts, march Eliezer's neighbours through the streets. \\"It was from that moment that I began to hate them, and my hate is still the only link between us today.\\" Here came the Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved ... His mere presence among the deportees added a touch of unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book ... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.Night 1982, 14‚Äì15. =Auschwitz= Tracks inside Auschwitz II-Birkenau, German-occupied Poland, leading from the gatehouse to the gas chamber Eliezer and his family are crammed into a closed cattle wagon with 80 others. On the third night one woman, Madame Sch√§chter‚ÄîNight's second unheeded witness‚Äîstarts screaming that she can see flames, until the others beat her. Men and women are separated on arrival at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the extermination camp within the Auschwitz complex. Eliezer and his father are \\"selected\\" to go to the left, which meant forced labour; his mother, Hilda, Beatrice and Tzipora to the right, the gas chamber. (Hilda and Beatrice managed to survive.) Men to the left! Women to the right! Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words. ... For a part of a second I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them disappear into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair ...and I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.Night 1982, 27. The remainder of Night describes Eliezer's efforts not to be parted from his father, not even to lose sight of him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people. His loss of faith in human relationships is mirrored in his loss of faith in God. During the first night, as he and his father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children's bodies into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead‚ÄîWiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves‚ÄîEliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence. At that moment he and his father are ordered to go to their barracks. But Eliezer is already destroyed. \\"[T]he student of the Talmud, the child that I was, had been consumed in the flames. There remained only a shape that looked like me.\\"Night 1982, 34. There follows a passage that Ellen Fine writes contains the main themes of Night‚Äîthe death of God and innocence, and the d√©faite du moi (dissolution of self), a recurring motif in Holocaust literature:. Hungarian Jews arrive at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, c. May 1944.\\"The Auschwitz Album: Arrival\\". Yad Vashem. Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.Night 1982, 32. With the loss of self goes Eliezer's sense of time: \\"I glanced at my father. How he had changed! ... So much had happened within such a few hours that I had lost all sense of time. When had we left our houses? And the ghetto? And the train? Was it only a week? One night ‚Äì one single night?\\"Night 1982, 34; . =Buna= In or around August 1944 Eliezer and his father are transferred from Birkenau to the work camp at Monowitz (known as Buna or Auschwitz III), their lives reduced to the avoidance of violence and the search for food.Night 1982, 50. Their only joy is when the Americans bomb the camp. God is not lost to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he?Night 1982, 61. Not heavy enough for the weight of his body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear. Behind me, I heard the same man asking: Where is God now? And I heard a voice within me answer him: ... Here He is‚ÄîHe is hanging here on this gallows.Night 1982, 61‚Äì62. Fine writes that this is the central event in Night, a religious sacrifice‚Äîthe binding of Isaac and crucifixion of Jesus‚Äîdescribed by Alfred Kazin as the literal death of God., citing Alfred Kazin, Contemporaries, Little, Brown & Co, 1962, 297. Afterwards the inmates celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, but Eliezer cannot take part: \\"Blessed be God's name? Why, but why would I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled ... How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces? ... But now, I no longer pleaded for anything. I was no longer able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused.Night 1982, 64; . =Death march= Buchenwald concentration camp In January 1945, with the Soviet army approaching, the Germans decide to flee, taking 60,000 inmates on a death march to concentration camps in Germany. Eliezer and his father are marched to Gleiwitz to be put on a freight train to Buchenwald, a camp near Weimar, Germany, 350 miles (563 km) from Auschwitz. Pitch darkness. Every now and then, an explosion in the night. They had orders to fire on any who could not keep up. Their fingers on the triggers, they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure. If one of us had stopped for a second, a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch. Near me, men were collapsing in the dirty snow. Shots.Night 1982, 81. Resting in a shed after marching over , Rabbi Eliahou asks if anyone has seen his son. They had stuck together for three years, \\"always near each other, for suffering, for blows, for the ration of bread, for prayer\\", but the rabbi had lost sight of him in the crowd and was now scratching through the snow looking for his son's corpse. \\"I hadn't any strength left for running. And my son didn't notice. That's all I know.\\"Night 1982, 86. Eliezer does not tell the man that his son had indeed noticed his father limping, and had run faster, letting the distance between them grow: \\"And, in spite of myself, a prayer rose in my heart, to that God in whom I no longer believed. My God, Lord of the Universe, give me strength never to do what Rabbi Eliahou's son has done.\\"Night 1982, 87. The inmates spend two days and nights in Gleiwitz locked inside cramped barracks without food, water or heat, sleeping on top of one another, so that each morning the living wake with the dead underneath them. There is more marching to the train station and onto a cattle wagon with no roof. They travel for ten days and nights, with only the snow falling on them for water. Of the 100 in Eliezer's wagon, 12 survive the journey. The living make space by throwing the dead onto the tracks: I woke from my apathy just at the moment when two men came up to my father. I threw myself on top of his body. He was cold. I slapped him. I rubbed his hand, crying: Father! Father! Wake up. They're trying to throw you out of the carriage ... His body remained inert ... I set to work to slap him as hard as I could. After a moment, my father's eyelids moved slightly over his glazed eyes. He was breathing weakly. You see, I cried. The two men moved away.Night 1982, 94. =Buchenwald, liberation= Buchenwald, 16 April 1945: Wiesel, second row, seventh from left The Germans are waiting with megaphones and orders to head for a hot bath. Wiesel is desperate for the heat of the water, but his father sinks into the snow. \\"I could have wept with rage ... I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here ... I yelled against the wind ... I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen.\\"Night 1982, 100. An alert sounds, the camp lights go out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him. But at that same moment this thought came into my mind. Don't let me find him! If only I could get rid of this dead weight, so that I could use all my strength to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.Night 1982, 101. His father is in another block, sick with dysentery. The other men in his bunk, a Frenchman and a Pole, attack him because he can no longer go outside to relieve himself. Eliezer is unable to protect him. \\"Another wound to the heart, another hate, another reason for living lost.\\" Begging for water one night from his bunk, where he has lain for a week, Chlomo is beaten on the head with a truncheon by an SS officer for making too much noise. Eliezer lies in the bunk above and does nothing for fear of being beaten too. He hears his father make a rattling noise, \\"Eliezer\\". In the morning, 29 January 1945, he finds another man in his father's place. The Kapos had come before dawn and taken Chlomo to the crematorium.Night 1982, 102‚Äì105. His last word was my name. A summons, to which I did not respond. I did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I had no more tears. And, in the depths of my being, in the recesses of my weakened conscience, could I have searched for it, I might perhaps have found something like ‚Äì free at last!Night 1982, 105. Chlomo missed his freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were making their way towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is transferred to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and they are to be moved‚Äîanother death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.Night 1982, 107‚Äì109. Writing and publishing =Move to France= Elie Wiesel, 1987 Wiesel wanted to move to Palestine after his release, but because of British immigration restrictions was sent instead by the Oeuvre au Secours aux Enfants (Children's Rescue Service) to Belgium, then Normandy. In Normandy he learned that his two older sisters, Hilda and Beatrice, had survived. From 1947 to 1950 he studied the Talmud, philosophy and literature at the Sorbonne, where he was influenced by the existentialists, attending lectures by Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Buber. He also taught Hebrew, and worked as a translator for the Yiddish weekly Zion in Kamf. In 1948, when he was 19, he was sent to Israel as a war correspondent by the French newspaper L'arche, and after the Sorbonne became chief foreign correspondent of the Tel Aviv newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. =1954: Un di Velt Hot Geshvign= Wiesel wrote in 1979 that he kept his story to himself for ten years. In 1954 he wanted to interview the French prime minister, Pierre Mend√®s-France, and approached the novelist Fran√ßois Mauriac, a friend of Mend√®s-France, for an introduction. Wiesel wrote that Mauriac kept mentioning Jesus: \\"Whatever I would ask ‚Äì Jesus. Finally, I said, 'What about Mend√®s- France?' He said that Mend√®s-France, like Jesus, was suffering ...\\" When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for the only time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, \\"Mr. Mauriac\\", we called him Ma√Ætre, \\"ten years or so ago, I have seen children, hundreds of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it.\\" I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping. ... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, \\"You know, maybe you should talk about it.\\" Wiesel started writing on board a ship to Brazil, where he had been assigned to cover Christian missionaries within Jewish communities, and by the end of the journey had completed an 862-page manuscript. He was introduced on the ship to Yehudit Moretzka, a Yiddish singer travelling with Mark Turkov, a publisher of Yiddish texts. Turkov asked if he could read Wiesel's manuscript. It is unclear who edited the text for publication. Wiesel wrote in All Rivers Run to the Sea (1995) that he handed Turkov his only copy and that it was never returned, but also that he (Wiesel) \\"cut down the original manuscript from 862 pages to the 245 of the published Yiddish edition.\\" Turkov's Tzentral Varband f√ºr Polishe Yidn in Argentina (Central Union of Polish Jews in Argentina) published the book in 1956 in Buenos Aires as the 245-page Un di velt hot geshvign (; \\"And the World Remained Silent\\"). It was the 117th book in a 176-volume series of Yiddish memoirs of Poland and the war, Dos poylishe yidntum (Polish Jewry, 1946‚Äì1966). Ruth Wisse writes that Un di Velt Hot Geshvign stood out from the rest of the series, which survivors wrote as memorials to their dead, as a \\"highly selective and isolating literary narrative\\". =1958: La Nuit= Wiesel translated Un di Velt Hot Geshvign into French and in 1955 sent it to Mauriac. Even with Mauriac's help they had difficulty finding a publisher; Wiesel said they found it too morbid. J√©r√¥me Lindon of Les √âditions de Minuit, Samuel Beckett's publisher, agreed to handle it. Lindon edited the text down to 178 pages. Published as La Nuit, a title chosen by Lindon, it had a preface by Mauriac and was dedicated to Chlomo, Sarah and Tzipora. =1960: Night= Wiesel's birthplace in Sighet, photographed in 2007 Wiesel's New York agent, Georges Borchardt, encountered the same difficulty finding a publisher in the United States. In 1960 Arthur Wang of Hill & Wang in New York‚Äîwho Wiesel writes \\"believed in literature as others believe in God\\"‚Äîpaid a $100 pro-forma advance and published that year a 116-page English translation by Stella Rodway as Night.; Samuels, Gertrude (13 November 1960). \\"When Evil Closed in: Night\\", The New York Times. The first 18 months saw 1,046 copies sell at $3 each, and it took three years to sell the first print run of 3,000 copies, but the book attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews and meetings with literary figures like Saul Bellow. By 1997 Night was selling 300,000 copies a year in the United States. By 2011 it had sold six million copies in that country, and was available in 30 languages.; . Sales increased in January 2006 when it was chosen for Oprah's Book Club. Republished with a new translation by Marion Wiesel, Wiesel's wife, and a new preface by Wiesel, it sat at no. 1 in The New York Times bestseller list for paperback non-fiction for 18 months from 13 February 2006, until the newspaper decided to remove it.. Memmott, Carol (16 January 2006). \\"Oprah picks 'Night'\\", USA Today. Donadio, Rachel (20 January 2008). \\"The Story of Night\\", The New York Times. It became the club's third bestseller to date, with over two million sales of the Book Club edition by May 2011. Reception Reviewers have had difficulty reading Night as an eyewitness account.Wyatt, Edward (19 January 2006). \\"The Translation of Wiesel's 'Night' Is New, but Old Questions Are Raised\\", The New York Times. According to literary scholar Gary Weissman, it has been categorized as a \\"novel/autobiography\\", \\"autobiographical novel\\", \\"non-fictional novel\\", \\"semi- fictional memoir\\", \\"fictional-autobiographical novel\\", \\"fictionalized autobiographical memoir\\", and \\"memoir-novel\\".Weissman 2004, 65. Ellen Fine described it as t√©moignage (testimony). Wiesel called it his deposition. Literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that Nights impact stems from its minimalist construction. The 1956 Yiddish version, at 865 pages, was a long and angry historical work. In preparation for the French edition, Wiesel's editors pruned without mercy.. Franklin argues that the power of the narrative was achieved at the cost of literal truth, and that to insist that the work is purely factual is to ignore its literary sophistication. Holocaust scholar Lawrence Langer argues similarly that Wiesel evokes, rather than describes: \\"Wiesel's account is ballasted with the freight of fiction: scenic organization, characterization through dialogue, periodic climaxes, elimination of superfluous or repetitive episodes, and especially an ability to arouse the empathy of his readers, which is an elusive ideal of the writer bound by fidelity to fact.\\" Franklin writes that Night is the account of the 15-year-old Eliezer, a \\"semi-fictional construct\\", told by the 25-year-old Elie Wiesel. This allows the 15-year-old to tell his story from \\"the post- Holocaust vantage point\\" of Night's readers. In a comparative analysis of the Yiddish and French texts, Naomi Seidman, professor of Jewish culture, concludes that there are two survivors in Wiesel's writing, a Yiddish and French. In re-writing rather than simply translating Un di Velt Hot Geshvign, Wiesel replaced an angry survivor who regards \\"testimony as a refutation of what the Nazis did to the Jews,\\" with one \\"haunted by death, whose primary complaint is directed against God ...\\" Night transformed the Holocaust into a religious event.; for an interview with Seidman, see Manseau, Peter (April 2001). \\"Revising Night: Elie Wiesel and the Hazards of Holocaust Theology\\". Killing the Buddha. Seidman argues that the Yiddish version was for Jewish readers, who wanted to hear about revenge, but the anger was removed for the largely Christian readership of the French translation. In the Yiddish edition, for example, when Buchenwald was liberated: \\"Early the next day Jewish boys ran off to Weimar to steal clothing and potatoes. And to rape German shiksas [un tsu fargvaldikn daytshe shikses].\\" In the 1958 French and 1960 English editions, this became: \\"On the following morning, some of the young men went to Weimar to get some potatoes and clothes‚Äîand to sleep with girls [coucher avec des filles]. But of revenge, not a sign.\\"; . Elie Wiesel, May 2010 Oprah Winfrey's promotion of Night came at a difficult time for the genre of memoir, Franklin writes, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, was found to have fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Wiesel wrote in 1967 about a visit to a Rebbe, a Hasidic rabbi, he had not seen for 20 years. The Rebbe is upset to learn that Wiesel has become a writer, and wants to know what he writes. \\"Stories,\\" Wiesel tells him, \\" ... true stories\\": About people you knew? \\"Yes, about people I might have known.\\" About things that happened? \\"Yes, about things that happened or could have happened.\\" But they did not? \\"No, not all of them did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end.\\" The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: \\"Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are‚Äîalthough they never occurred.\\" Sources =Notes= = References = =Works cited=       Further reading *Rosenthal, Albert (April 1994‚ÄìMay 1995). \\"Memories of the Holocaust\\". part 1, part 2 (deportations from Sighet).

History  The Cannaregio Canal, which was the main route into the city until the construction of a railway link to the mainland, gave the district its name (Canal Regio is Italian for Royal Canal). Development began in the eleventh century as the area was drained and parallel canals were dredged. Although elegant palazzos were built facing the Grand Canal, the area grew primarily with working class housing and manufacturing. Beginning in 1516, Jews were restricted to living in the Venetian Ghetto. It was enclosed by guarded gates and no one was allowed to leave from sunset to dawn. However, Jews held successful positions in the city such as merchants, physicians, money lenders, and other trades. Restrictions on daily Jewish life continued for more than 270 years, until Napoleon Bonaparte conquered the Venetian Republic in 1797. He removed the gates and gave all residents the freedom to live where they chose. Santa Maria di Nazareth, known as Chiesa degli Scalzi. In the 19th century, civil engineers built a street named Strada Nuova through Cannaregio, and a railway bridge and road bridge were constructed to connect Venice directly to Mestre.

Competing in the extra- lightweight (48 kg) class, she won a record seven world titles and five Olympic medals including two golds at Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004. After her retirement, the International Judo Federation named her \\"best female judoka ever\\". In 2010, she was elected to the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Japanese parliament.  Early and personal life  Ryoko Tamura was born in Higashi-ku, Fukuoka on September 6, 1975. She started judo at the age of seven. She studied literature at Teikyo University and joined Toyota in 1998. In 2003, she married Yoshitomo Tani, an Olympian and professional baseball player then with Orix Blue Wave. The wedding reception reportedly cost $3 million. The couple has two sons, born in 2005 and 2009. Sporting career Standing at , Tani fought in the extra-lightweight (48 kg) division her whole career and, unlike many of her opponents, she never had to cut weight before a competition. Her first major title was at the 1990 Fukuoka International Women's Judo Championships, a tournament she went on to win 13 years in a row. In 1993, she won her first world title and received her fourth dan. She went on to win the biennial world championships in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007. She did not compete in 2005 as she was expecting her first child. This record seven wins was only beaten by French judoka Teddy Riner in 2015, in an era when world championships had become annual events. She competed in five Olympic Games and won as many medals. At Barcelona 1992, aged only 16 years old, she defeated in the semi-final veteran British fighter and 4-time world champion Karen Briggs, but she lost the final by a small margin against the reigning world champion, C√©cile Nowak of France. This was followed by a 4-year, 84-match winning streak that led her to her second Olympic final at Atlanta 1996. Tani was the clear favorite against the relatively unknown North-Korean Kye Sun Hui, but she was unable to live up to the expectations. Kye resisted all her attacks and scored an advantage towards the end of the fight. Tani's second Olympic silver was a huge setback, and the Japanese media talked of an \\"Olympic curse\\". Reflecting on this years later, Tani said, \\"there was never a curse ‚Ä¶ in 1992, I was 16, I was lacking experience ‚Ä¶ in 1996, I was 20\\". After 1996, she remained unbeaten for 12 years. At Sydney 2000, she had a tough semi-final against North Korea's Cha Hyon-hyang, but she left no chance to her opponent in the final, Lyubov Bruletova of Russia. After only 36 seconds, Tani delivered an uchi mata (inner-thigh throw) and was awarded an ippon and the gold metal. Four years later in Athens, she scored a series of ippon-victories to reach the final, in which she dominated France's Fr√©d√©rique Jossinet, taking an early koka lead that she confirmed with a waza-ari in the last seconds of the fight. She was the first woman judoka to win two Olympic golds. In Beijing in 2008, she saw her hopes of a third-straight gold evaporate when judges awarded penalty points to Romania's Alina Dumitru after both competitors failed to show much aggression. Looking stunned, Tani fought desperately after the final controversial penalty call, but with only seconds left she had no time to mount an attack.http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008081061261800.htm&date;=2008/08/10/&prd;=th& She defeated Russia's Lyudmila Bogdanova for bronze. She retired from competition in 2010. In a career spanning around 20 years, she was only defeated 5 times. In 2011, the International Judo Federation named her \\"best female judoka ever\\" at its 60th anniversary gala in Paris. = Selection controversy = Tani lost the 2007 All-Japan Weight Class Judo Championship, which doubles as the qualifier for Olympics and the World Championships on those years when the events take place, but was selected as Japan's representative anyway by the All Japan Judo Federation (AJJF). She then won the gold medal in the Rio de Janeiro World Championships. Tani lost the All- Japan again in April 2008, to 21-year-old Emi Yamagishi. Again, the AJJF selected Tani for Japan's team in place of Yamagishi. The AJJF refused to answer questions about Tani's selection after the decision, but later said that Tani was selected because \\"She is especially strong against international opponents\\". The selection prompted Philip Brasor, media commentator for the Japan Times to ask \\"...maybe Tani is the better choice, but why have qualifying bouts in the first place?\\". The AJFF uses qualifying bouts as only one criterion considered for selection, with performance in international events as another. Popularity and legacy Tani followed in the footsteps of Kaori Yamaguchi, who in 1984 had become the first Japanese woman to ever win a world championship ‚Äì the sport had long been a male preserve. Yamaguchi was the inspiration for the character of Yawara Inokuma, the heroine of a popular manga and anime series who prepares for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. When Tani represented Japan in Barcelona, she was viewed by the Japanese public as a real-life Yawara and was soon nicknamed Yawara-chan or Tawara. Thanks to her success and cheerful personality, Tani grew immensely popular in Japan. She appeared in numerous TV commercials and her wedding ceremony, broadcast live on Japanese television, was followed by 20 million spectators. The birth of her first child also became a major press event, with camera crews waiting for the first glimpse of her emergence from the hospital. The characters of Ryoko Izumo and Ryoko Kano from the World Heroes and Fighter's History fighting video games series, respectively, were both loosely based on her. Tani is credited for the boom in women's judo witnessed by Japan in the 1990s, leading to the rise of a new generation of competitors. Because she did not let her marriage put an end to her sporting career, and won her last world title as a young mother, she is also viewed as a symbol of the changing role of women in Japanese society. Political career Tani was introduced to politics by Ichiro Ozawa. On May 10, 2010 the Democratic Party announced that she would represent the party as a proportional candidate in the Summer 2010 House of Councillors election. Tani initially stated that she still intended to pursue her judo career, but she eventually retired from judo after she won the seat in question. In July 2012, she left the Democratic Party for the newly created and short-lived People's Life First. Later that same year, she was one of the founding members of the People's Life Party, alongside her mentor Ichiro Ozawa. Tani was approached by several parties in the lead up to the July 2016 election, but Ozawa demanded she remain with the party, as her defection would have meant the party fell below the minimum requirement of five Diet members and lost its official party status. In June 2016 Tani announced her decision to remain with the party until the election, but not seek a second term.

It diverts water into the Truckee Canalhttps://cityoffernley.org/339/History-of- the-Canal that would otherwise enter Pyramid Lake. The canal feeds Lake Lahontan reservoir in the Carson River watershed, where it is used for irrigation.Joseph I. Burns and Michael C. Archer. The Truckee Canal: A transbasin Diversion From The Truckee River Basin To The Carson River Basin It was the first project of the newly organized U.S. Reclamation Service (known today as the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation), organized by the Reclamation Act of 1902.Nevada: Derby Diversion Dam As a result of the diversion, Winnemucca Lake lost inflow and dried up, and Pyramid Lake lost more than in elevation, resulting in the near-extinction of the Lahontan cutthroat trout. The dam is operated by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District. It was named after the Derby Southern Pacific Railroad station.  History  The Truckee River diversion dam built in 1903‚Äì04 diverts water that formerly ran unchecked into Winnemucca Lake and Pyramid Lake to the Lake Lahontan reservoir, where it is used for irrigation. The dam was constructed for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation following an authorization for construction issued on March 14, 1903. Construction commenced on October 2, 1903 and was completed on May 20, 1905. State Historical Marker No. 43. The project was authorized on March 14, 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock. The dam is an original feature of the Newlands Reclamation Project, named after Nevada Congressman Francis Newlands, who sponsored the Reclamation Act. Not surprisingly, a dam in Newlands, Nevada launched the project. It was one the first of five projects authorized and built under the Reclamation Act of 1902. With passage of the act, the federal government assumed a major role in designing and constructing large-scale irrigation projects throughout the West. The diversion dam is part of the network of water storage, diversion, and conveyance structures that provides water for irrigating about of farmland in an area that receives less than of annual precipitation. The dam is not designed for water storage. It is a low high concrete structure that diverts water from the Truckee River into the Truckee Canal and then two main project canals, the Southside Main Canal (\\"V\\" Line) and the Northside Main Canal (\\"T\\" Line). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as the \\"Derby Diversion Dam.\\"  Environmental impact  Water diverted at Derby Dam to farms in Lahontan Valley constitutes as much as three-fourths of the flow of the Truckee River, the largest diversion of water from the Truckee River after it flows from Lake Tahoe. The reduction in flow to Pyramid Lake and the inability of Lahontan cutthroat trout (the \\"salmon-trout\\" as described by Fr√©mont) to bypass the dam for spawning eliminated them from Lake Lahontan and its tributaries and caused the near extinction of the species. But in 1979 a remnant population of the original Pyramid Lake cutthroat trout was discovered in a small brook on Pilot Peak, on the Nevada/Utah border. This population was used to successfully restock Lake Lahontan.

This dam slows a normally fast and shallow river for partial diversion to a hydroelectric dam. The diversion tunnel opening can be seen in the upper left. The Imperial Dam diverting the Colorado River in the southwestern United States. A diversion dam is a dam that diverts all or a portion of the flow of a river from its natural course. Diversion dams do not generally impound water in a reservoir; instead, the water is diverted into an artificial water course or canal, which may be used for irrigation or return to the river after passing through hydroelectric generators, flow into a different river or be itself dammed forming an onground or groundwater reservoir or a storm drain. An early diversion dam is the Ancient Egyptian Sadd el-Kafara Dam at Wadi Al-Garawi, which was located about twenty five kilometres south of Cairo. Built around 2600 BC for flood control, the structure was 102 metres long at its base and eighty seven metres wide. It was destroyed by a flood while it was still under construction.G√ºnther Garbrecht: \\"Wasserspeicher (Talsperren) in der Antike\\", Antike Welt, 2nd special edition: Antiker Wasserbau (1986), pp.51-64 (52f.) Classification Diversion dams are one of three classifications of dams which include: storage dams, detention dams, and diversion dams. Storage dams are used to store water for extended lengths of time. The stored water then can be used for irrigation, livestock, municipal water supply, recreation, and hydroelectric power generation. Detention dams are built to catch surface runoff to prevent floods and trap sediment by regulating the flow rate of the runoff into channels downstream. Diversion dams are used to raise the water level in order to redirect the water to the designated location. The diverted water can be used for supplying irrigation systems or reservoirs. Purpose Diversion dams are installed to raise the water level of a body of water to allow the water to be redirected. The redirected water can be used to supply irrigation systems, reservoirs, or hydroelectric power generation facilities. The water diverted by the diversion dam to the reservoirs can be used for industrial applications or for municipal water supply. Construction The design a diversion dam will fall into one of four basic types: embankment style dams, buttress style dams, arch style dams, and gravity styles dams. =Embankment style diversion dam= Embankment style diversion dams are constructed to counteract the force of the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with enough weight to withstand the force. Embankment dams are commonly made from materials in the surrounding area where the dam is being built. The materials generally include: sand, gravel, and rocks. The combination of these building materials with either clay or an impervious membrane gives the embankment dam its integrity. As a result, the combination of its simple construction and locally available building materials the cost of building an embankment dam is lower than the other types of dams. =Buttress style diversion dam= Buttress style diversion dams are designed using angle supports on the downstream side of the dam. The supports are fixed to the wall of the dam in order to help counteract the force of the water on the dam. Buttress style dams are built across wide valleys that do not have a solid bedrock foundation. Bedrock is solid rock that makes up the upper part of the earth‚Äôs crust. Bedrock can be made from sedimentary, igneous, and metaphoric rock origins. Buttress dams require extensive steel framework and labor. As a result, buttress style dams are expensive to construct and are seldom built today. =Arch style diversion dam= Arch style diversion dams are designed using an arch shape with the top of the arch facing upstream. The arch shape provides extra strength to counteract the force of the water. Arch style dams are generally constructed in narrow canyons. Arch style dams are commonly made from concrete. To ensure the dam‚Äôs integrity, a solid contact between the bedrock foundation and the dam‚Äôs concrete base is required. The dome style dam is a type of arch dam. The dome style dam curves in both the horizontal plane and vertical plane. The arch style dam only curves in the horizontal. =Gravity style diversion dam= Gravity style diversion dams are built to non counteract the force of the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with enough weight to withstand the force. Gravity dams are commonly constructed using masonry or cement. The foundations of the gravity dams are generally constructed on top of a solid bedrock foundation. However, gravity dams can be built over unconsolidated ground as long as proper measures are put in place to stop the flow of water under the dam. If water were to get under the dam, the dam could fail.

(One authority says the battle was fought on June 13.) Background Joscelin I of Edessa had captured Azaz in northern Syria from the atabeg of Aleppo in 1118. The next year the Crusaders under Roger of Salerno were severely defeated at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, and King Baldwin II of Jerusalem was captured while patrolling in Edessa in 1123. Prelude In 1124 Baldwin II was released, and almost immediately he laid siege to Aleppo on October 8, 1124. This caught the attention of al- Bursuqi, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul. Al-Bursuqi marched south to relieve the siege of Aleppo, which was nearing the point of surrender in January 1125 after a three-month siege. In spite of the city being \\"the greatest prize the war could offer\\", Baldwin cautiously withdrew without a fight. Battle Later, al-Bursuqi (who had received troops also by Toghtekin of Damascus) besieged the town of Azaz, to the north of Aleppo, in territory belonging to the County of Edessa. Baldwin II, Leo I of Armenia, Joscelin I, and Pons of Tripoli, with a force of 1,100 knights from their respective territories (including knights from Antioch, where Baldwin was regent), as well as 2,000 infantry, met al-Bursuqi outside Azaz, where the Seljuk atabeg had gathered his much larger force. Baldwin pretended to retreat, thereby drawing the Seljuks away from Azaz into the open where they were surrounded. After a long and bloody battle, the Seljuks were defeated and their camp captured by Baldwin, who took enough loot to ransom the prisoners taken by the Seljuks (including the future Joscelin II of Edessa). =Casualties= The number of Muslim troops killed was more than 1,000, according to Ibn al-Athir. William of Tyre gave 24 dead for the Crusaders and 2,000 for the Muslims. Fulcher of Chartres suggested 5 emirs and 2,000 soldiers dead, while Matthew of Edessa estimated 15 emirs and 5,000 troops killed. Aftermath Al-Bursuqi retired to Aleppo, leaving his son Masud as governor and crossed the Euphrates to Mosul, where he gathered troops to renew the fight. Apart from relieving Azaz, this victory allowed the Crusaders to regain much of the influence they had lost after their defeat at Ager Sanguinis in 1119. Baldwin planned to attack Aleppo as well, but Antioch, which passed to Bohemund II when he came of age in 1126, began to fight with Edessa and the plan fell through. Aleppo and Mosul were united under the much stronger ruler Zengi in 1128, and Crusader control of northern Syria began to dwindle.

Despite the Turkish forces of Kilij Arslan almost destroying the Crusader contingent of Bohemond, other Crusaders arrived just in time for a very close victory. Background The crusaders had left Nicaea on 26 June 1097, with a deep distrust of the Byzantines, who had taken the city without their knowledge after a long siege. In order to simplify the problem of supplies, the Crusader army had split into two groups; the weaker led by Bohemond of Taranto, his nephew Tancred, Robert Curthose, Robert of Flanders, and the Byzantine general Tatikios in the vanguard, and Godfrey of Bouillon, his brother Baldwin of Boulogne, Raymond IV of Toulouse, Stephen II, and Hugh of Vermandois in the rear. On 29 June, they learnt that the Turks were planning an ambush near Dorylaeum (Bohemond noticed that his army was being shadowed by Turkish scouts). The Turkish force, consisting of Kilij Arslan I and his ally Hasan of Cappadocia, along with help from the Danishmendids, led by the Turkish prince Gazi G√ºm√ºshtigin. Contemporary figures place this number between 25,000-30,000, more recent estimates are between 6,000 and 8,000 men. However, several sources give absurdly high Turkish numbers: 150,000 men according to Raymond of Aguilers and 360,000 men reported by Fulcher of Chartres, neither of which were possible due to the lack of supplies for so many men and horses, and the Turkish use of hit-and run horse archer tactics, indicating a smaller army. Bohemond's force probably numbered about 10,000 (not counting a large number of noncombatants), the majority on foot. Military figures of the time often imply perhaps several men-at-arms, spearmen, archers or crossbowmen per knight (i.e., a stated force of 500 knights is assumed to contain an additional 1,500 soldiers), so it seems reasonable that Bohemond had with him approximately 2,000 cavalry and 8,000 foot soldiers. On the evening of 30 June, after a three-day march, Bohemond's army made camp in a meadow on the north bank of the river Thymbres, near the ruined town of Dorylaeum (many scholars believe that this is the site of the modern city of Eski≈üehir). Battle Battle of Dorylaeum (Gustave Dor√©). On 1 July, Bohemond's force was surrounded outside Dorylaeum by Kilij Arslan. Godfrey and Raymond had separated from the vanguard at Leuce, and the Turkish army attacked at dawn, taking Bohemond's army (not expecting such a swift attack) entirely by surprise, shooting arrows into the camp. Bohemond's knights had quickly mounted but their sporadic counterattacks were unable to deter the Turks. The Turks were riding into camp, cutting down noncombatants and unarmoured foot soldiers, who were unable to outrun the Turkish horses and were too disoriented and panic-stricken to form lines of battle. To protect the unarmoured foot and noncombatants, Bohemond ordered his knights to dismount and form a defensive line, and with some trouble gathered the foot soldiers and the noncombatants into the centre of the camp; the women acted as water-carriers throughout the battle. While this formed a battle line and sheltered the more vulnerable men-at-arms and noncombatants, it also gave the Turks free rein to maneuver on the battlefield. The Turkish mounted archers attacked in their usual style - charging in, shooting their arrows, and quickly retreating before the crusaders could counterattack. The archers did little damage to the heavily-armoured knights, but inflicted heavy casualties on their horses and on the unarmoured foot soldiers. Bohemond had sent messengers to the other Crusader army and now struggled to hold on until help arrived, and his army was being forced back to the bank of the Thymbris river. The marshy riverbanks protected the crusaders from mounted charge, as the ground was too soft for horses, and the armoured knights formed a circle protecting the foot soldiers and noncombatants from arrows, but the Turks kept their archers constantly supplied and the sheer number of arrows was taking its toll, reportedly more than 2,000 falling to horse-archers. Bohemond's knights were impetuous - although ordered to stand ground, small groups of knights would periodically break ranks and charge, only to be slaughtered or forced back as the Turkish horses fell back beyond range of their swords and arrows, while still shooting at them with arrows, killing many of the knights' horses out from under them. And although the knights' armour protected them well (the Turks called them 'men of iron') the sheer number of arrows meant that some would find unprotected spots and eventually, after so many hits, a knight would collapse from his wounds. Anatolia in 1097, before the Siege of Nicaea and the Battle of DorylaeumJust after midday, Godfrey arrived with a force of 50 knights, fighting through the Turkish lines to reinforce Bohemond. Through the day small groups of reinforcements (also from Raymond, and Hugh, as well as Godfrey) arrived, some killed by the Turks, others fighting to reach Bohemond's camp. As the Crusader losses mounted, the Turks became more aggressive and the Crusader army found itself forced from the marshy banks of the river into the shallows. But the Crusaders held on, and after approximately 7 hours of battle, Raymond's knights arrived (it is unclear if Raymond was with them, or if they arrived ahead of Raymond), launching a vicious surprise attack across the Turkish flank that turned them back in disarray and allowed the Crusaders to rally. The Crusaders had formed a line of battle with Bohemond, Tancred, Robert of Normandy, and Stephen on the left wing, Raymond, Robert of Flanders in the centre and Godfrey, Robert of Flanders, and Hugh on the right, and they rallied against the Turks, proclaiming \\"hodie omnes divites si Deo placet effecti eritis\\" (\\"today if it pleases God you will all become rich\\"). Although the ferocity of the Norman attack took the Turks by surprise, they were unable to dislodge the Turks until a force led by Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, the Papal legate, arrived in mid-afternoon, perhaps with Raymond in the van, moving around the battle through concealing hills and across the river, outflanking the archers on the left and surprising the Turks from the rear. Adhemar's force fell on the Turkish camp, and attacked the Turks from the rear. The Turks were terrified by the sight of their camp in flames, and by the ferocity and endurance of the knights, since the knights' armour protected them from arrows and even many sword cuts, and they promptly fled, abandoning their camp and forcing Kilij Arslan to withdraw from the battlefield. Aftermath The crusaders did indeed become rich, at least for a short time, after capturing Kilij Arslan's treasury. The Turks fled and Arslan turned to other concerns in his eastern territory. Arslan punitively took the male Greek children from the region extending from Dorylaeum to Iconium, sending many as slaves to Persia. On the other hand, the crusaders were allowed to march virtually unopposed through Anatolia on their way to Antioch. It took almost three months to cross Anatolia in the heat of the summer, and in October they began the siege of Antioch. With the Crusader army moved onwards towards Antioch, the Emperor Alexios I achieved part of his original intent in inviting the Crusaders in the first place: the recovery of Seljuk-held imperial territories in Asia Minor. John Doukas re-established Byzantine rule in Chios, Rhodes, Smyrna, Ephesus, Sardis, and Philadelphia in 1097-1099\\\\. This success is ascribed by Alexios' daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and falseness. The Gesta Francorum did praise the Turkish army's bravery and superhuman efforts at Dorylaeum.

Some of the invaders in the history of Afghanistan include the Maurya Empire, the Greek Empire of Alexander the Great of Macedon, Umar, an Arab Caliphate, the Mongol Empire led by Genghis Khan, the Timurid Empire of Timur, the Mughal Empire, various Persian Empires, the Sikh Empire, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and most recently a coalition force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops, the majority from the United States, which entered the country in the first-ever invocation of NATO's Article 5 \\"an attack on one is an attack on all\\" following the September 11 attacks in the United States. The country is now entitled the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and has a democratically-elected government. A reduced number of NATO troops remain in the country in support of the government under the U.S.‚ÄìAfghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement. Purpose From a geopolitical sense, controlling Afghanistan is vital in controlling the rest of Southern Asia, or getting a passage through Central Asia, reflecting its geographic position in the region. Afghanistan played an important part in the Great Game power struggles. Historically, the conquest of Afghanistan has also played an important role in the invasion of India from the west through the Khyber Pass. History =Persian Conquests= While relatively little detail is known, parts of the region of nowadays Afghanistan came under rule of the Median kingdom for a short time. Afghanistan partially fell to the Achaemenid Empire after it was conquered by Darius I of Persia. The area was divided into several provinces called satrapies, which were each ruled by a governor, or satrap. These ancient satrapies included: Aria (Herat); Arachosia (Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, Bamiyan and Quetta); Bactriana (Balkh); Sattagydia (Ghazni); and Gandhara (Kabul, Jalalabad, Peshawar). =Greek Conquest and Kushan Invasions= Alexander the Great invaded what is today Afghanistan in 330 BC as part of war against Persia. Comprising the easternmost satrapies of Persia, Afghanistan provided some challenging battles in his conquest of the remaining lands of Persia. Renamed Bactria, and settled with his Ionian veterans, Alexander began his invasion of India from what is now Jalalabad, attacking the Indus River basin through the Khyber Pass. Several cities in Afghanistan are named for Alexander, including Alexandria Arachosia, now called Kandahar (a contraction of Iskandahar). Following the death of Alexander and the partition of his kingdom, the Province of Bactria was under the rule of Alexander's former general, Seleucus, who now formed the Seleucid Dynasty, with its capital in Babylon. But the Greek Soldiers in Bactria, based on the remoteness of their territory, declared independence, defeated Seleucid armies sent to reconquer them, and founded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which lasted for more than three centuries in Afghanistan, and western India. This Greek Kingdom called Bactria carried on Greek culture while completely cut off from Europe for three centuries. One of the cities, Ai-Khanoum was excavated in 1970s, showing a complete Greek city with an acropolis, amphitheater, temples, and numerous statues. Greek art has been found in Bactria showing influence from Indian Buddhist art creating something of an hybrid artistic style. Bactrian King Menander I converted to Buddhism after staging multiple theological and philosophical debates between his Greek priests and Indian Buddhist monks. Menander I is remembered in Buddhist Sutras as \\"King Milinda of the Yunani.\\" The Ionian origin of the Greek veterans who settled Bactria is remembered to this day by the Afghan word for Greeks, which is \\"Ionani.\\" Bactrian Greeks left a legacy of coinage, architecture, and Buddhist art, which comprised the Ghandara culture, especially the Greco-Buddhist Art affecting all of East Asia to this day. The last Greek Kingdom in Afghanistan was conquered by the Kushan invaders in the first century AD, a full three centuries after Alexander. But Greek language continued to be used by the Kushans in their coinage for the next several centuries. =Conquest by Arab Caliphate= In the seventh to ninth centuries, following the disintegration of the Sassanid Persian Empire and Roman Empire, leaders in the world theatre for the last four centuries and archrivals, the area was again invaded from the west, this time by Umar, second Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, in the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan, eventually resulting in the conversion of most of its inhabitants to Islam. This was one of many Muslim conquests following the establishment of a unified state in the Arabian Peninsula by the prophet Muhammad. At its height, Muslim control - during the period of the Umayyad Caliphate - extended from the borders of China to the Iberian Peninsula (modern day Spain and Portugal), the Middle East, North Africa, parts of southern Europe, parts of south East Europe, parts of central Asia, and parts of South Asia. =Mongol Empire= In the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia (1219-1221), Genghis Khan invaded the region from the northeast in one of his many conquests to create the huge Mongol Empire. His armies slaughtered thousands in the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, Jalalabad etc. After Genghis Khan returned to Mongolia, there was a rebellion in the region of Helmand which was brutally put down by his son and successor, Ogedei Khan, who put all male residents of Ghazni and Helmand to the sword in 1222; the women were enslaved and sold. Thereafter most parts of Afghanistan other than the extreme south-eastern remained under Mongol rule as part of the Ilkhanate and Chagatai Khanate. The Hazara people claim to be descendants of the Mongol and Turkic invaders, though this is disputed as the first mention of Hazara people is made by Babur in the 16th century.\\"HAZƒÄRA: ii. HISTORY\\". Alessandro Monsutti (Online ed.). United States: Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. December 15, 2003. Retrieved 9 August 2012. The Hazara constitute the majority of Shia adherents in Afghanistan today. Additionally, many areas of Afghanistan are named after Mongol and Turkic leaders, including Band-e-Timur (meaning \\"Timur's block\\") in Maywand District in Kandahar Province, the only district never taken from the Taliban throughout the western intervention of the 21st century, Jaghatu District (named in honor of Chagatai Khanate) in Wardak Province, and the village of Wech Baghtu in Shah Wali Kot District, named after Batu.Tareekh e Afghanistan - Usman Barakzai = Conquest by Tamerlane (Timur) and Mughal Empire = From 1383 to 1385, the Afghanistan area was conquered from the north by Timur, leader of neighboring Transoxiana (roughly modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and adjacent areas), and became a part of the Timurid Empire. Timur was from a Turko-Mongol tribe and although a Muslim, saw himself more as an heir of Genghis Khan. Timur's armies caused great devastation and are estimated to have caused the deaths of 17 million people. He brought great destruction on Afghanistan's south, slaughtering thousands and enslaving an equal number of women. Allied with the Uzbeks, Hazaras and other Turkic communities in the north his dominance over Afghanistan was long-lasting, allowing him for his future successful conquests in Central Anatolia against the Ottomans.Tareekh e Afghanistan - Usman Barakzai In the next period, many of the Eastern and Southern parts of Afghanistan came under rule of various dynasties based in other parts of South Asia, such as by the Delhi Sultanate. After the slow disintegration of the Timurid Empire in 1506, the Mughal Empire was later established in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India by Babur in 1526, who was a descendant of Timur through his father and possibly a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother. By the 17th century, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India, but later declined during the 18th century. = The Sikh Empire invasion, 1837-1838 = In the early 1837 the Battle of Jamrud was fought between the Sikhs under Maharajah Ranjit Singh and the Afghans under Emir Dost Muhammad Khan. Since the consolidation of the Sikh Empire in Punjab, Maharajah Ranjit Singh had turned the wave of invasions on Afghanistan. The Afghans had been losing their long held territories to Sikhs over the preceding years due to internal conflicts, and had seen their once mighty empire shrink with the loss of the Punjab region, Multan, Kashmir, Derajat, Hazara and Peshawar. Maharaja Ranjit Singh availed himself of anarchy in Kabul and made as invasion of Peshawar, the South-West-Eastern frontiers of Peshawar with Punjab having been neglected by Sultan Yar Mohammed Khan and Dost Mohammad Khan, the then Afghan governors of Peshawar who found themselves helpless and vacated the city. Punjabi forces with Mian Ghausa and Diwan Mohkam Chand leading the charge With Sardar Hari Singh Nalua as general of Cavalry didn't had to face any fight what so ever. Maharaja appointed Jahan Dad Khan, ex governor of Attock as new governor of Peshawar in November 1838. =British invasions: 1838-1842, 1878-1880 and 1919= During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Afghanistan was invaded three times from British India. The First Anglo-Afghan War of 1838-1842 was conducted with the intention of limiting Russian influence in the country and quelling raiding from across the border. Within four years the British were expelled. After the Indian Mutiny, the British launched a second invasion, the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878-1880, for much the same reasons but did not attempt to maintain a permanent presence. A third conflict broke out in 1919. It last for three months, from May to August, and ended in a compromise that saw Afghanistan reassert its independence and control over its relations with other countries while agreeing to a border with British India known as the Durand Line. =Soviet invasions: 1929, 1930 and 1979= The Soviet Union successfully invaded Afghanistan in 1929 against the Saqqawists and again in 1930 to fight the Basmachi movement. The Soviet Union, along with other countries, was a direct supporter of the new Afghan government after the Saur Revolution in April 1978. However, Soviet-style reforms introduced by the government such as changes in marriage customs and land reform were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and Islam.See Wilson Center, International History declassified: The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. By 1979, fighting between the Afghan government and various other factions within the country, some of which were supported by the United States and other countries, led to a virtual civil war and in a phone call to the Kremlin in March 1979 Afghan prime minister Nur Muhammad Taraki requested military assistance. This was refused by Soviet prime minister Alexei Kosygin on behalf of the Politburo.Bukovsky Archive 18 March 1979 (No. 242) transcript of Kosygin phone conversation with Taraki. After Taraki was murdered the new Afghan Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin repeated requests for Soviet military support, at least to protect his residence. Finally, in December the Politburo decided to deal with the situation in Afghanistan,Bukovsky Archive 6 December 1979 (Pb 176/82). Decision in response to KGB and General Staff advice. and in early December sent special forces which attacked Amin's palace and killed him, putting the exiled Babrak Kamal in his place. These forces were subsequently reinforced by the 40th Army which entered Afghanistan on 24 December 1979. As the Kremlin foresaw, this intervention would cause problems around the world for the USSR, with the policy of detente and, not least, at the forthcoming Olympic Games due to take place in summer 1980 in Moscow.Bukovsky Archive 28 January 1980 (Pb 181/34) Protecting Soviet interests worldwide. The result was a far- reaching boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, supported not only by the United States but by many of the 65 other invited countries that did not take part. At its greatest extent the Soviet military contingent in Afghanistan numbered 100,000 personnel. This presence remained for a decade and kickstarted U.S. and Saudi funding for Islamic Mujahideen groups opposed to both the Afghan government and the Soviet military presence. The local Mujahideen, along with fighters from several different Arab nations (Pathan tribes from across the border also participated in the war; they were supported by the Pakistani ISI), fought the Soviet forces to a standstill. On 24 January 1989 Gorbachev's Politburo took the decision to withdraw most of the Soviet forces,The Wilson Center Digital Archive: \\"Measures in connection with the upcoming withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan\\" Politburo minute, 24 January 1989 (Pb 146/VI). while continuing to provide military assistance to the Afghan government.Bukovsky Archive 21 March 1990 (No. 318/2/0354) Ministry of Defence to Central Committee. Eventually, in-fighting within the Mujahideen led to the rise of warlords in Afghanistan, and from them emerged the Taliban.Nushin Arbabzadah, \\"The 1980s mujahideen, the Taliban and the shifting idea of jihad\\", The Guardian, 28 April 2011 (Comment is Free). The Soviets left behind the only highway in the country as well as many concrete structures built in the major cities, and airfields that are still in use (e.g. at Bagram). =Invasion by the United States and NATO, October 2001= U.S. Army soldiers prepare a Humvee to be sling-loaded by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter in Bagram on July 24, 2004. On October 7, 2001 the United States, supported by some NATO countries including the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as other allies, began an invasion of Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. The invasion was launched to capture Osama bin Laden, who was accused of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The US military forces did not capture him, though they toppled the Taliban government and disrupted bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network. The Taliban government had given shelter to Bin Laden. On May 2, 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed by United States Armed Forces in Pakistan. The Taliban leadership survives in hiding throughout Afghanistan, largely in the southeast, and continues to launch guerrilla attacks against forces of the United States, its allies, and the current government of President Ashraf Ghani. In 2006, the US forces turned over security of the country to NATO-deployed forces in the region, integrating 12,000 of their 20,000 soldiers with NATO's 20,000. The remainder of the US forces continued to search for Al-Qaeda militants. The Canadian military assumed leadership and almost immediately began an offensive against areas where the Taliban guerrillas had encroached. At the cost of a few dozen of their own soldiers, the British, American, and Canadian Forces managed to kill over 1,000 alleged Taliban insurgents and sent thousands more into retreat. Many of the surviving insurgents, however, began to regroup and further clashes are expected by both NATO and Afghan National Army commanders.

Known mainly as the Fremen wife and legal concubine of protagonist Paul \\"Muad'Dib\\" Atreides, Chani is the daughter of Imperial Planetologist Liet-Kynes and his Fremen wife Faroula, and later the mother of the twins Ghanima and Leto II Atreides. The character is resurrected as a ghola and appears in Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's novels which complete the original series. Chani is portrayed by actress Sean Young in the David Lynch film Dune (1984), and by Barbora Kodetov√° in the John Harrison miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune (2000) and the sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (2003). Zendaya will portray Chani in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film Dune. Character overview =Dune= In Dune, Paul's prescience begins manifesting itself through dreams while he is still living in his ancestral home on the planet Caladan; he sees Chani in these visions, though they have not yet met. Paul and the Atreides come to the desert planet Arrakis, but Paul's father Duke Leto is soon killed by the Harkonnens and Paul and his mother Lady Jessica are forced to flee into the desert. They are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the planet's native Fremen, and Chani is the Fremen woman put in charge of protecting and guiding Paul. They soon become lovers, and Paul rises as a religious leader among the Fremen, and is called Muad'Dib. Already a talented warrior before meeting Paul, Chani becomes deadly after training by Paul and Jessica in the Bene Gesserit martial arts called the \\"weirding way\\" by the Fremen. Chani later manages to bring Paul out of the deep spice trance he falls into after using spice essence to enhance his powers. Paul and Chani's first child, Leto II (not to be confused with their later son, Leto II Atreides), is killed as an infant in a Corrino raid on their home in the deep desert. To cement his control of the Empire after deposing Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Paul takes Shaddam's daughter, the Princess Irulan as his wife. Chani understands the political reasons, but Paul reassures her: > \\"I swear to you now ... that you'll need no title. That woman over there > will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing > and we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the > Landsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of > me than my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor > instant of desire.\\" Herbert, Frank (1965). Dune. . Jessica adds: > \\"Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as > less than a concubine‚Äînever to know a moment of tenderness from the man to > whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of > concubine‚Äîhistory will call us wives.\\" =Dune Messiah= Twelve years later in Dune Messiah, Paul remains completely loyal to Chani. With their breeding program in mind, the Bene Gesserit are desperate to regain control of Paul's bloodline, and are fearful of the effect Chani's \\"wild\\" genes may have on their offspring. Wishing to rid himself of their machinations, Paul negotiates with the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam: \\"You may have my seed, but not my person ... Irulan banished and inseminated ... You may have my seed for your plans, but no child of Irulan's will sit on my throne.\\"Herbert, Frank (1969). Dune Messiah. . Of course, artificial insemination is prohibited in the wake of the Butlerian Jihad, and the idea of it is as horrific to the Sisterhood as the loss of the \\"precious Atreides genes\\". Irulan, herself Bene Gesserit-trained, secretly feeds Chani contraceptives to prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. However, Chani eventually changes to an ancient Fremen diet to enhance fertility; Irulan is unable to interfere, and Chani soon becomes pregnant. Tragically, Chani dies giving birth to the twins Ghanima and Leto II. His intricate plan coming to fruition, the Tleilaxu agent Scytale offers to \\"resurrect\\" Chani as a ghola in return for Tleilaxu control of the empire, but Paul has him killed. Through his prescience, Paul can see that Chani's death during childbirth is far less painful and cruel than her possible future fates had she survived. =Children of Dune= Despite her death, Chani lives on as part of the Other Memory of her pre-born twins. In Children of Dune, this ancestral self is summoned by Ghanima for her guidance, but Chani's persona nearly possesses Ghanima completely.Herbert, Frank (1976). Children of Dune. pgs 73-75. Leto II manages to save his sister from this Abomination by summoning Paul though his own Other Memory; Paul threatens Chani, who releases her hold on Ghanima. At the end of the novel, Chani's memory-self becomes a guardian against Ghanima's other ancestral memories who may try to possess her, allowing her daughter's personality to continue and grow in safety. =God Emperor of Dune= According to God Emperor of Dune, a version of Chani's memory-self also exists in Leto II. By the time of the novel, Leto is able to allow his ancestral memories to speak through his mouth without threat of Abomination. At one point, he allows Chani to speak through him. =Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune= In the 2006 Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson sequel Hunters of Dune, gholas of Paul and Chani are among the others created to assist mankind in the climactic battle with what turns out to be the thinking machines. In Sandworms of Dune (2007), Paul ultimately duels another Paul Atreides ghola ‚Äî named Paolo ‚Äî created by the Face Dancers and twisted by the sadistic ghola of Baron Harkonnen himself. Paul is mortally wounded, but the trauma restores his memories and he manages to heal himself. Later, on the recovering planet Dune, the awakened gholas of Paul and Chani go about restoring the planet to its former glory. They have reverted to the ways of the ancient Fremen, resolving to lead simple lives and unafraid of the plots and schemes that had threatened them in their previous lives. Now able to devote all of his attention to her, Chani remarks that Paul has finally learned how to treat his wife. As the novel closes, Paul reaffirms his love for Chani, telling her he has loved her for five thousand years. In adaptations Zendaya will portray Chani in the 2021 film Dune.

According to a statement on the web, it was originally created by Ransom Scott as a place where uncensored discussion of government policies could occur before adult content was added to make it more profitable. More recently, the adult content has been removed. Controversy Part of the controversy about whitehouse.com was that users (especially minors in most cases) wishing to visit the website of the White House (www.whitehouse.gov) could easily go to the adult website instead. Although .gov, a top-level domain (TLD), is available only to official government sites in the United States, .com is a much more common TLD and is frequently entered by mistake. Because of the explicit and commercial content of the site, it was frequently cited as one of the most egregious examples of domain name misuse, up until the domain was sold. The website whitehouse.org, a humor site that formerly satirized the former U.S. president George W. Bush, remains controversial for similar reasons, although less so because its content is usually much less explicit. In 2006, PC World ranked Whitehouse.com #13 on its list of \\"The 25 Worst Web Sites\\". Opposition In December 1997, a cease and desist letter arrived from the White House, stating: \\"‚Ä¶we do not challenge your right to pursue it or to exercise your First Amendment rights, but we do challenge your right to use the White House, the President, and the First Lady as a marketing device. For adult internet users, that device is, at the least, part of a deceptive scheme. For younger Internet users, it has more disturbing consequences.\\" The letter had no effect and the site stayed up. Statuses and uses In 2004, Dan Parisi decided to sell the domain,primarily because his son would be going into kindergarten the next year. The sale did not occur. As of 2003, Parisi was making US$1 million annually from the site alone. Parisi had said he did not want to sell the domain name to anyone in the adult entertainment industry, and even claimed to have turned down what was essentially a blank check from a buyer hiding his identity behind his broker.

Spread over an area of , the airport is approximately due west from the city centre, from Kovalam beach, from Technopark and from the under construction Vizhinjam International Seaport. Trivandrum International Airport operates two terminals. Terminal 1 handles domestic flight operations (except Air India) and Terminal 2 handles all international flight operations as well as all domestic flights by Air India. In addition to civil operations, Trivandrum Airport caters to the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Coast Guard for their operations. IAF have an exclusive apron to handle all their operations. Trivandrum airport also caters to the Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology which carries out pilot training activities. Trivandrum International Airport hosts Air India's Narrow body Maintenance, repair and overhaul unit ‚Äì MRO consisting of twin hangars for servicing Boeing 737 type aircraft, servicing mostly Air India Express aircraft. History The airport was established in 1932 as part of the Royal Flying Club under the initiative of Colonel Raja Goda Varman, Consort of Rani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, Rani of Attingal and of Travancore Kingdom. Raja Goda Varman, a trained pilot, felt the need of an airport to accommodate Travancore in the aviation map of India and requested the Travancore Durbar to initiate the process for establishing an aerodrome. A detailed report was made and presented to the King by Consort Prince in this regard. It may be mentioned that the King was the brother of Colonel Raja's wife, and the colonel's own children were the heirs to the throne. In 1935, on royal patronage of H.H Maharaja Chithira Thirunal, Tata Airlines made its maiden flight to the airport using DH.83 Fox Moth aircraft under command of India's first pilot Nevill Vintcent carrying Jamshed Navoroji, a Tata company official, and Kanchi Dwarakadas, commercial agent of Travancore in Karachi, with a special mail from the Viceroy of British India, Lord Willingdon, wishing birthday greetings to the Maharaja. The first flight took off on 1 November 1935, carrying mails of Royal Anchal (Travancore Post) to Bombay. In 1938, the Royal Government of Travancore acquired a Dakota as Maharaja's private aircraft and placed the first squadron of Royal Indian Air Force (Travancore) for protection of the state from aerial attacks. After Independence, the airstrip was used for domestic flights with the construction of a new domestic terminal, Terminal 1. International operations were initiated by Air India to cities in the Arabian Peninsula in the late 1970s using Boeing 707. By early 80s, the then Indian Airlines started service to Colombo, followed by service to Male. Later, SriLankan Airlines (then Air Lanka) and Air Maldives (now Maldivian started operations. Followed by Indian Airlines, that started a service to Sharjah. On 1 January 1991, TIA was upgraded to an international airport, making it the fifth international airport of India after Delhi, Bombay, Madras & Calcutta. On 1 March 2011, the first flight operated from the new international terminal, Terminal 2. IX 536 (Air India Express) from Sharjah marked the first arrival. Air India Express operated the first departure to Dubai from this new terminal. IndianOil Skytanking is the company which introduced single man refuelling in India and started refuelling operations at Trivandrum in March 2016. In November 2018, the Central government cleared a proposal by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for leasing out six of its airports, including Trivandrum, as part of initiatives to provide world class infrastructure and services to stakeholders. The following month, AAI commenced an international competitive bidding process to award Operations, Management and Development (OMD) contracts for the six airports. The Adani Group, GMR Group and Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) participated in the bidding process which was won by the Adani Group. Since some public interest litigations were filed with respect to the bidding process for the airport, the Union Cabinet give its approval for awarding the airport to Adani subject to the outcome of Writ Petition. Accordingly, AAI signed a letter of agreement with Adani in September 2020. Adani Trivandrum International Airport Limited (ATIAL), floated by the Adani Group to run the airport, would operate, manage and develop the airport for a period of fifty years. As per the agreement, ATIAL would get control of the airport only after a concession agreement was executed and the performance bank guarantee was paid and subject to clearance of legal hurdles.

In contrast to a bomber aircraft, which is intended to release bombs and then return to its base for re-use, a flying bomb crashes into its target and is therefore itself destroyed in its attack. The term flying bomb is most frequently associated with two specific Second World War weapons, the German V-1 and the Japanese Ohka. The former was unpiloted, as the first known cruise missile ever deployed in combat; the latter carried a pilot on a kamikaze mission. Historic exemplars The Sphere of March 13, 1915 published an article on \\"The Possibilities of an Aerial Torpedo Controlled by Wireless\\", suggested by a \\"correspondent to the Sphere\\" and declared feasible by an \\"aviation expert\\". The first attempt to build a flying bomb (alternatively called an \\"aerial torpedo\\" in the Navy) was undertaken by Elmer Sperry for the US Navy in 1916, called the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane, and was based on a Curtiss N-9 seaplane. This led to a mission-specific Curtiss design, the Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb, which was almost completely unsuccessful. The US Army also tried to develop a flying bomb in World War I, the Kettering Bug, but the war ended before the program could mature. The functioning but unsuccessful German Mistel flying bomb was essentially an enormous shaped charge mounted on a repurposed twin-engined medium bomber's airframe (most often a Junkers Ju 88) in place of the cockpit, that was guided by a fighter sitting on top. The fighter first took a course towards the target, then released the Mistel which would continue to its target. The best known example of a flying bomb is the German V-1, many of which targeted London in 1944 during World War II. Types Flying bombs may be powered or unpowered, piloted or unpiloted, although unpowered flying bombs such as the United States Navy Bat and German Hagelkorn (\\"Hailstone\\") and Fritz X designed during World War II are usually referred to as glide bombs. Flying bombs are analogous to modern cruise missiles such as the jet-powered Tomahawk and rocket-powered Exocet, in that they are equipped with wings to provide lift over a long distance and generally have engines that operate up until impact. This is significantly different from ballistic missiles, which are launched on a ballistic trajectory and do not rely on lift to reach their targets.

He remained as chief engineer until the second relief in November 1857, when he was badly wounded while crossing an exposed space with Outram and Sir Henry Havelock to meet with Sir Colin Campbell. He recovered sufficiently to be present at the capture of Lucknow in March 1858. Napier then joined Sir Hugh Rose as second- in-command for the march on Gwalior and commanded the 2nd Brigade at the Battle of Morar in June 1858. After Gwalior fell, Napier and his 700 men pursued, caught and defeated Tatya Tope's force of 12,000 men on the plains of Jaora Alipur. After Sir Hugh Rose's departure, Napier assumed command of the Gwalior division and helped capture Paori in August 1858, routed Prince Ferozepore at Ranode in December 1858 and secured the surrender of Man Singh and Tatya Tope, ending the war, in January 1859.

Abyssinia  British Expedition\\". Caricature by Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1878. Napier achieved his greatest fame as an army officer when he led the expedition of 1868 against Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian ruler was holding a number of Protestant missionaries hostage, in his mountain capital of Magdala, as well as two British diplomats who had attempted to negotiate their freedom (Tewodros had unwisely taken them hostage as well). After months of planning and other preparations, the advance guard of engineers landed at Zula on the Red Sea to construct a port on 30 October 1867; Napier himself arrived in Zula on 2 January 1868, and on 25 January 1868 led his troops south into the Ethiopian Highlands. The expedition involved crossing of mountainous terrain lacking roads or bridges occupied by local people with a known history of hostility towards outsiders. The expedition overcame the first obstacle, the terrain, by thorough logistical planning and engineering ability. Shrewd diplomacy dealt with the second obstacle, local opposition. On the one hand, Napier made it clear to the Ethiopians that the sole intent of the British force was to rescue the imprisoned Europeans‚Äînot conquest; on the other, Napier met with local potentates such as Ras Kassa (the future Emperor Yohannes IV) and arranged to purchase needed supplies with the 4.35 million Maria Theresa thalers (the preferred currency of the area) the British had purchased from the mint in Vienna. What helped Napier was the general disaffection with, if not hostility to, Tewodros, and a desire to replace him, held by several native leaders, as well as a general sense that his hostage-taking was bound to lead to trouble. Napier's troops reached the foot of Magdala on 9 April 1868. The next day, Good Friday, he defeated the 9,000 troops still loyal to Tewodros at the Battle of Magdala for the loss of only 2 British lives. Although Emperor Tewodros surrendered his hostages and made repeated efforts for a negotiated surrender, the distrustful Napier pressed on and ordered an assault on the mountain redoubt on 13 April 1868. The British captured Magdala, and Emperor Tewodros killed himself, leaving a grandiose statement that he preferred to \\"fall into the hands of God, rather than man.\\" Napier then ordered the destruction of Tewodros' artillery and the burning of Magdala as retribution. This included the expedition and its troops looting many local artifacts, which they took back to Britain. The artifacts still reside in collections in the UK, despite representations by some for their return. After the Ethiopian campaign, Napier was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Freeman of the City of London. He was also elevated to the peerage as Baron Napier of Magdala on 11 July 1868 and granted an annuity for life.  Later career  Napier became Commander-in-Chief, India with the local rank of full general in April 1870, and having been promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 1 April 1874, he became Governor of Gibraltar in June 1876. In February 1878, however, he was recalled to London and appointed to command an expeditionary force which was being prepared in anticipation of a war with Russia. When war did not break out he returned to his duties in Gibraltar. In November 1879 he represented Queen Victoria at Madrid as ambassador extraordinary upon the occasion of Alfonso XII of Spain's second marriage and in December 1879 he became a member of the Royal Commission on the organization of the army. Standing down as Governor of Gibraltar, he was promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1883. Napier was also honorary colonel of the 3rd London Rifle Volunteer Corps and colonel- commandant of the Royal Engineers. In January 1887 he was appointed Constable of the Tower of London. Napier died of influenza at his residence in London on 14 January 1890. He was given a state funeral and buried in St Paul's Cathedral on 21 January 1890.\\"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral\\" Sinclair, W. p. 461: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909  Legacy  In 1883 the British government installed one Armstrong 100 ton gun in a battery in Gibraltar that they named the Napier of Magdala Battery and in 1891 a statue of Napier on horseback by Sir Joseph Boehm was unveiled in front of Carlton House Gardens in London: it was moved to Queen's Gate, Kensington in 1920. The descendants of the Third City of London Rifle Volunteer Corps are located within Napier House Army Reserve Centre, Grove Park, London; the building is named in his honour.  Honours  Napier's honours included: * Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) ‚Äì 27 April 1868 (KCB ‚Äì 27 July 1858) * Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) ‚Äì 16 September 1867  Family  In June 1840 Napier married Anne Pearse; they had three sons and three daughters before his wife died in childbirth in 1849. In April 1861 he married Maria Cecilia Smythe Scott: they had six sons and three daughters.

Honda, alarmed that they were losing their hard-won reputation for reliability, moved to introduce the VFR750 motorcycles featuring gear-driven ohc cams and a very high build quality. The first three or four iterations of VFR motorcycles re-established Honda's reputation for quality, and the motorcycles received almost universal praise from journalists and riders alike. The VFR was originally a 750 cc, but became an 800 cc in due course. New models featured technological innovation, such as a single-sided swingarm, linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. The VFR1200 became the first motorcycle to feature a dual-clutch transmission. Not all of these innovations proved popular with riders, who often preferred the simple robustness of the earlier models. Honda also developed a limited edition VFR, the Honda RC30, as a homologation racing platform. This motorcycle achieved some racing success, but the introduction of very light inline-four motorcycles by competing firms led Honda to downgrade its racing plans. Honda's VF model lineup had engine capacities ranging from 400 cc to 1,000 cc. Another Honda, the shaft-driven ST1100 also featured a V4 engine, but this touring motorcycle does not form part of the VF series. V4 engine Prior to its adoption by Honda, the V4 design had been used only rarely for motorcycles, most notably by Matchless. Ian Chadwick Histories Retrieved 21 July 2015 In modern times, the V4 configuration has been embraced by Aprilia, Ducati, Suzuki, Yamaha & Norton. Compared to an in-line four, the advantages of a 90¬∞ V4 engine include compactness, narrow width, and perfect primary balance giving a smooth and nearly vibration-free operation. A disadvantage is that it is more expensive to manufacture, and, just like a V-twin, more difficult to locate ancillaries and inlet & exhaust systems. VF Models Honda VF750S In 1982 VF models were introduced to the public at the Cologne Motorcycle Show with a V4 engine mounted in a square-tube steel frame.Motor Cycle News UK weekly newspaper, 22 September 1982, Cologne Show '82. Special Issue, Europe's Biggest Show pp.cover, 27-31. \\"Honda's VF750 features a square tube frame as used on the works racers. Light and strong, the box frame also appears on the new 550 Suzuki\\". Accessed and added 2015-09-19 That very year, reliability and quality control problems arose, possibly due to new automated production equipment at Honda's plant in Hamamatsu, Japan. Regardless, Honda sold out its first year's inventory of Sabres and the Magnas were not far behind. 1983 saw the engine revised to correct the problems from the previous production year and the introduction of the V65 and the Interceptor. Cam-wear problems surfaced during 1984 in the larger displacement bikes, which, by the time it was corrected, led to eight factory cam revisions over the course of just one year. VFR750 & VFR800 VFR750 The 748 cc Mk.I VFR750 was introduced in 1985, and was over- engineered in a bid to re-establish a reputation for reliability. It had an alloy beam frame, gear driven cams. The Mk.IA changed wheel sizes from 16\\" front & 18\\" rear to 17\\" front and rear, and the fairing was slightly modified. After this was a series of VFR models which featured various innovations, including a single-sided swingarm, linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. In due course the geared cam drive was dropped in favour of cheaper chain-drive. A slight capacity increase led to later models being designated the \\"VFR800\\". VFR1200F A much larger capacity VFR model, the VFR1200F, was revealed at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009.Porter (2009) The new narrow-angle SOHC V4 engineDowns (2009)does not use the V-Tec design of the smaller VFRs. It has an optional six-speed push-button operated dual clutch transmission with three modes: automatic, sport and manual. The modes are similar to those on the Honda DN-01 but with a conventional gearbox shifted automatically, similar to a \\"Tiptronic\\" system, and without a hand-operated clutch rather than a hydrostatic drive.Frank (2009)Westlake (2009) To date, the VFR1200 has not sold particularly well, as buyers have tended to favour the smaller VFR800F (RC79). Honda have permitted the Ariel Motor Company, British makers of the Ariel Atom sports car, to use the VFR1200's V4 engine in a new motorcycle, the Ariel Ace. Race Models Honda developed the RC30 as a homologation racing version which was used from 1988 to 1993. It was the first large capacity motorcycle to use a single-sided swingarm.. The RC30 was succeeded in 1994 by the RC45.

It is a large evergreen conifer that has great religious and historical significance in the cultures of the Middle East, and is referenced many times in the literature of ancient civilisations. It is the national emblem of Lebanon and is widely used as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. Description Foliage Cedrus libani can reach in height, with a massive monopodial columnar trunk up to in diameter.Farjon 2010, p.258 The trunks of old trees ordinarily fork into several large, erect branches.Masri 1995 The rough and scaly bark is dark grey to blackish brown, and is run through by deep, horizontal fissures that peel in small chips. The first-order branches are ascending in young trees; they grow to a massive size and take on a horizontal, wide-spreading disposition. Second-order branches are dense and grow in a horizontal plane. The crown is conical when young, becoming broadly tabular with age with fairly level branches; trees growing in dense forests maintain more pyramidal shapes. =Shoots and leaves= The shoots are dimorphic, with both long and short shoots. New shoots are pale brown, older shoots turn grey, grooved and scaly. C. libani has slightly resinous ovoid vegetative buds measuring long and wide enclosed by pale brown deciduous scales. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals and concentrated at the proximal end of the long shoots, and in clusters of 15‚Äì35 on the short shoots; they are long and wide, rhombic in cross-section, and vary from light green to glaucous green with stomatal bands on all four sides.Hemery & Simblet 2014, p.53 =Cones= Cedrus libani produces cones beginning at around the age of 40. Its cones are borne in autumn, the male cones appear in early September and the female ones in late September.CABI 2013, p. 116 Male cones occur at the ends of the short shoots; they are solitary and erect about long and mature from a pale green to a pale brown color. The female seed cones also grow at the terminal ends of short shoots. The young seed cones are resinous, sessile, and pale green; they require 17 to 18 months after pollination to mature. The mature, woody cones are long and wide; they are scaly, resinous, ovoid or barrel-shaped, and gray-brown in color. Mature cones open from top to bottom, they disintegrate and lose their seed scales, releasing the seeds until only the cone rachis remains attached to the branches.Farjon 2010, p.259 The seed scales are thin, broad, and coriaceous, measuring long and wide. The seeds are ovoid, long and wide, attached to a light brown wedge-shaped wing that is long and wide. C. libani grows rapidly until the age of 45 to 50 years; growth becomes extremely slow after the age of 70. Taxonomy 246x246px Cedrus is the Latin name for true cedars.Farjon 2010, p.254 The specific epithet refers the Lebanon mountain range where the species was first described by French botanist Achille Richard; the tree is commonly known as the Lebanon cedar or cedar of Lebanon.Bory 1823, p.299 Two distinct types are recognized as varieties: C. libani var. libani and C. libani var. brevifolia. C. libani var. libani: Lebanon cedar, cedar of Lebanon ‚Äì grows in Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey. C. libani var. stenocoma (the Taurus cedar), considered a subspecies in earlier literature, is now recognized as an ecotype of C. libani var. libani. It usually has a spreading crown that does not flatten. This distinct morphology is a habit that is assumed to cope with the competitive environment, since the tree occurs in dense stands mixed with the tall-growing Abies cilicica, or in pure stands of young cedar trees. C. libani var. brevifolia: The Cyprus cedar occurs on the island's Troodos Mountains. This taxon was considered a separate species from C.libani because of morphological and ecophysiological trait differences.Debazac 1964Ladjal 2001 It is characterized by slow growth, shorter needles, and higher tolerance to drought and aphids.Fabre et al. 2001, pp. 88‚Äì89 Genetic relationship studies, however, did not recognize C. brevifolia as a separate species, the markers being undistinguishable from those of C. libani.Fady et al. 2000Kharrat 2006, p.282 Distribution and habitat Male cone C. libani var. libani is endemic to elevated mountains around the Eastern Mediterranean in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. The tree grows in well-drained calcareous lithosols on rocky, north- and west-facing slopes and ridges and thrives in rich loam or a sandy clay in full sun. Its natural habitat is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with an annual precipitation of ; the trees are blanketed by a heavy snow cover at the higher altitudes. In Lebanon and Turkey, it occurs most abundantly at altitudes of , where it forms pure forests or mixed forests with Cilician fir (Abies cilicica), European black pine (Pinus nigra), eastern Mediterranean pine (Pinus brutia), and several juniper species. In Turkey, it can occur as low as . C. libani var. brevifolia grows in similar conditions on medium to high mountains in Cyprus from altitudes ranging from . History and symbolism In the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest great works of literature, the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and his friend Enkidu travel to the legendary Cedar Forest to kill its guardian and cut down its trees. While early versions of the story place the forest in Iran, later Babylonian accounts of the story place the Cedar Forest in the Lebanon. The Lebanon cedar is mentioned several times in the Hebrew bible. Hebrew priests were ordered by Moses to use the bark of the Lebanon cedar in the treatment of leprosy.Leviticus 14:1‚Äì4 Solomon also procured cedar timber to build the Temple in Jerusalem. The Hebrew prophet Isaiah used the Lebanon cedar as a metaphor for the pride of the world,Isaiah 2:13 with the tree explicitly mentioned in Psalm 92:13 as a symbol of the righteous. =National and regional significance= The Flag of Lebanon The Lebanon cedar is the national emblem of Lebanon, and is displayed on the flag of Lebanon and coat of arms of Lebanon. It is also the logo of Middle East Airlines, which is Lebanon's national carrier. Beyond that, it is also the main symbol of Lebanon's \\"Cedar Revolution\\" of 2005, the 2019‚Äì20 Lebanese protests, also known as Thawra (meaning revolution in Arabic) along with many Lebanese political parties and movements, such as the Lebanese Forces. Finally, Lebanon is sometimes metonymically referred to as the Land of the Cedars.Erman 1927, p.261Cromer 2004, p.58 Arkansas, among other states, has a Champion Tree program that records exceptional tree specimens. The Lebanon cedar recognized by the state is located inside Hot Springs National Park and is estimated to be over 100 years old. Cultivation The Lebanon cedar is widely planted as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens.Hemery & Simblet 2014, p.55Howard 1955, p.168 When the first cedar of Lebanon was planted in Britain is unknown, but it dates at least to 1664, when it is mentioned in Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber.Hemery & Simblet 2014, p. 54. In Britain, cedars of Lebanon are known for their use in London's Highgate Cemetery. C. libani has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). =Propagation= An eight- month old seedling In order to germinate Cedrus Libani seeds potting soil is preferred since it is less likely to contain fungal species which may kill the seedling in its early stages. Before sowing it is important to soak the seed at room temperature for a period of 24 hours followed by cold stratification (3 ~ 5 ¬∞C) for two to four weeks. Once the seeds have been sown, it is recommended that they be kept at room temperature (~20 ¬∞C) and in the vicinity of sunlight. The soil should be kept slightly damp with low frequency watering. Over-watering may cause damping off which will quickly kill the seedlings. Initial growth will be around 3‚Äì5 cm the first year and will accelerate subsequent years.Tree Seed Online LTD Uses Cedar wood is prized for its fine grain, attractive yellow color, and fragrance. It is exceptionally durable and immune to insect ravages. Wood from C. libani has a density of 560 kg/m¬≥; it is used for furniture, construction, and handicrafts. In Turkey, shelterwood cutting and clearcutting techniques are used to harvest timber and promote uniform forest regeneration. Cedar resin (cedria) and cedar essential oil (cedrum) are prized extracts from the timber and cones of the cedar tree.CABI 2013, p. 117Coxe 1808, p.CED Ecology and conservation Over the centuries, extensive deforestation has occurred, with only small remnants of the original forests surviving. Deforestation has been particularly severe in Lebanon and on Cyprus; on Cyprus, only small trees up to tall survive, though Pliny the Elder recorded cedars tall there.Willan, R. G. N. (1990). The Cyprus Cedar. Int. Dendrol. Soc. Yearbk. 1990: 115‚Äì118. Attempts have been made at various times throughout history to conserve the Lebanon cedars. The first was made by the Roman emperor Hadrian; he created an imperial forest and ordered it marked by inscribed boundary stones, two of which are in the museum of the American University of Beirut.Shackley, pp. 420‚Äì421 Extensive reforestation of cedar is carried out in the Mediterranean region. In Turkey, over 50 million young cedars are planted annually, covering an area around .Anon. History of Turkish Forestry. Turkish Ministry of Forestry.Khuri, S., & Talhouk, S. N. (1999). Cedar of Lebanon. Pages 108‚Äì111 in Farjon, A., & Page, C. N. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan: Conifers. IUCN/SSC Conifer Specialist Group. . Lebanese cedar populations are also expanding through an active program combining replanting and protection of natural regeneration from browsing goats, hunting, forest fires, and woodworms. The Lebanese approach emphasizes natural regeneration by creating proper growing conditions. The Lebanese state has created several reserves, including the Chouf Cedar Reserve, the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the Tannourine Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri.Talhouk & Zurayk 2004, pp.411‚Äì414Semaan, M. & Haber, R. 2003. In situ conservation on Cedrus libani in Lebanon. Acta Hort. 615: 415‚Äì417.Cedars of Lebanon Nature Reserve Because during the seedling stage, differentiating C. libani from C. atlantica or C. deodara is difficult, the American University of Beirut has developed a DNA-based method of identification to ensure that reforestation efforts in Lebanon are of the cedars of Lebanon and not other types.Farjon, Aljos. Conifers: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan, International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK, 1999, page 110 Diseases and pests C. libani is susceptible to a number of soil-borne, foliar, and stem pathogens. The seedlings are prone to fungal attacks. Botrytis cinerea, a necrotrophic fungus known to cause considerable damage to food crops, attacks the cedar needles, causing them to turn yellow and drop. Armillaria mellea (commonly known as honey fungus) is a basidiomycete that fruits in dense clusters at the base of trunks or stumps and attacks the roots of cedars growing in wet soils. The Lebanese cedar shoot moth (Parasyndemis cedricola) is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae found in the forests of Lebanon and Turkey; its larvae feed on young cedar leaves and buds.

Remesiana was an ancient Roman city and former bishopric, which remains an Eastern Orthodox and also a Latin Catholic titular see, located around and under the modern city of Bela Palanka in Serbia. Remesiana was declared an Archaeological Sites of Great Importance in 1987, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.  History  Remesiana was built after the Roman conquest of Moesia, in the area of the town Aiadava. It was on the route of ancient Via Militaris road between Naissus and Serdica in Dacia Mediterranea. = Districts = Byzantine Emperor Justinian had the following strongholds in the district of Remesiana : Brittura, Subaras, Lamponiana, Stronges, Dalmatas, Primiana, Phrerraria, Topera, Tomes, Cuas, Tzertzenutzas, Stens, Aeadaba, Destreba, Pretzouries, Cumudeba, Deurias, Lutzolo, Rhepordenes, Spelonca, Scumbro, Briparo, Tulcoburgo, Longiana, Lupophantana, Dardapara, Burdomina, Grinciapana, Graecus and Drasimarca. = Site of the Assembly = Austrian historian Karl Patsch's opinion that the provincial assembly of Moesia Superior sat at Remesiana, based upon the fact that some inscriptions were discovered, \\"inaugurated between 202 and 209 by Ulpiana in honour of Septimius Severus and Julia Augusta,\\"CIL III 1685, 1686 and 1688 = 8257 is not correct.

However, that year Septimius Severus returned from the east to Rome and probably passed through Remesiana and on that occasion the inscriptions were inaugurated.  Ecclesiastical History  Remesiana was import enough in the Late Roman province of Dacia Mediterranea to become (circa 300 AD) one of the suffragans of its capital's Metropolitan, the Archdiocese of Serdica, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. It was suppressed circa 500 AD. Only two residential Suffragan Bishops of Remesiana are historically documented : * Saint Nicetas of Remesiana (fl. ca. 335‚Äì414), friend of Paulinus of Nola, and to whom Gennadio di Marsiglia dedicated a brief biographical note in De Viris Illustribus, patron saint of Romania, canonized by both Catholic and Orthodox churches * Diogenianus, participant at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449. = Titular see = Remesiana is an Eastern Orthodox titular see, within the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church.Serbian Orthodox Church (2011): Biography of Bishop Andrej of Remesiana Remesiana is also a Roman Catholic titular seeRemesiana Catholic Encyclopedia since circa 1890, when the diocese as nominally restored as Latin titular bishopric of Remesiana (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Remesianen(sis) (Latin adjective).

The T-Bones are members of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. They played their home games at Just Bats Field at T-Bones Stadium (formerly CommunityAmerica Ballpark) from 2003, when the team started as a member of the Northern League, through 2019. In 2011, the team joined the modern American Association. In 2018, the T-Bones won their first- ever American Association championship by defeating the St. Paul Saints. The team's mascot is named Sizzle. History The team was founded in 1993 as the Duluth‚ÄìSuperior Dukes (representing Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin), a charter member of the Northern League. The Dukes were mostly unsuccessful in their history, but won the Northern League championship 1997, though league records do not reflect such continuity. = Northern League (2003‚Äì2010) = The T-Bones broke ground on T-Bones Stadium September 4, 2002, and played their first home game on June 6, 2003, just over nine months later. In their inaugural season, the team finished 43‚Äì46, but enjoyed a banner season from Eddie Pearson, who led the league in batting average (.362), RBIs (78), and hits (124) and was named 2003 Northern League Most Valuable Player. The T-Bones finished the 2004 regular season with a 48‚Äì48 record. However, the T-Bones won the second-half South Division title and faced the Schaumburg Flyers in the first round of the playoffs. The T-Bones lost the best-of-five series 3‚Äì2. For the year, T-Bones player Eddie Pearson received the Most Valuable Player Award, Rick Muntean received Co-Executive of the Year, and the team received Organization of the Year. Several league records were set by T-Bones players: Jonathan Krysa set records for innings pitched (), total batters faced, and games started (24); Rick Prieto set new records for walks (78) and runs (97) while tying the league record for triples (10); and Eddie Pearson set the intentional walks record with 17. The T-Bones accumulated a 45‚Äì49 record in 2005. They finished second in the first half with a record of 27‚Äì19, just missing the playoff berth, but never contended in the second half due to the loss of several key players. In 2006, Jonathan Krysa was named Northern League Pitcher of the Year with a record of 13‚Äì5 and a 3.74 ERA. The T-Bones finished third in both halves of the season. They led the second-half race until the final week, when a disastrous season-ending road trip ended their hopes. On October 16, the T-Bones announced the firing of manager, \\"Dirty\\" Al Gallagher, who had been the team's first and only manager. He was replaced by Andy McCauley. During the 2006 campaign, the team hosted the Northern League All-Star Game on July 18 in front of 5,975 fans. Eight T-Bones were selected to the East Division squad, which won the game 7‚Äì6, scoring two runs in the bottom of the ninth. Kansas City closer Byron Embry earned the win and T-Bones infielder Chad Sosebee drove in the winning run. The highlight of the night, though, was the appearance of 94-year-old Buck O'Neil, a former Kansas City Monarchs star who took one at-bat for each side, drawing walks each time. He became the oldest person to ever appear in a professional baseball game. The team hired former Schaumburg manager Andy McCauley to replace Gallagher in 2007. They began the season with only two players carried over from the previous year, and released them by mid-season for a complete turnover of its 22-man roster. The T-Bones finished deep in last place in the Southern Division in the first half, but moved into the lead during the second half and held that lead until a late-season collapse left them in second-place finish. The team's overall 44‚Äì52 record was one game worse than the previous season's franchise record. Despite their finish, the organization was named Northern League Organization of the Year. In 2008, the Northern League contracted to six teams, and a single-division full season schedule was used. The T-Bones finished only marginally better (46‚Äì50) than the two previous seasons, but nonetheless qualified as the fourth team in the playoffs. They swept the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks in the best-of-five semifinal round of the playoffs and then defeated the Gary SouthShore RailCats three games to one to win the Northern League championship. The T-Bones matched their previous season's record (46‚Äì50) and finish (fourth in a six-team league) in 2009, but could not advance past the first round, losing that series 3‚Äì2 to Gary. Shortly after the end of the season, the team announced that hitting coach Tim Doherty had been promoted to manager for the following season, replacing Andy McCauley. The Northern League expanded to eight teams again for 2010, but maintained the same playoff format, allowing the top four finishers into the postseason. The T-Bones enjoyed their most successful season under new manager Tim Doherty, winning 58 games and setting a new league record with 162 home runs, exceeding the previous high by more than 30%. They led through much of the year, but faded in the stretch to finish in second place, three games behind Fargo-Moorhead. T-Bones second baseman Jason Blackwood led the Northern League in home runs (31), RBI (86), runs scored (82), hits (141), total bases (271), and slugging percentage (.636) while finishing third in batting average (.331), and was named 2010 Northern League Player of the Year. The team beat the Joliet Jackhammers three games to two in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept in three games by Fargo-Moorhead in the finals. The T-Bones were named Northern League Organization of the Year for the second time in four seasons, and CommunityAmerica Ballpark was named \\"Northern League Playing Surface of the Year\\" for the second-straight season. = American Association (2011‚Äìpresent) = On October 13, 2010, the T-Bones left the Northern League, along with the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, Gary SouthShore RailCats, and the Winnipeg Goldeyes to join the American Association (AA) for the 2011 season. The team fell out of the race early and finished fifth (last) in their division, though their 48‚Äì52 record was better than any third-place finisher in the other two divisions. Outfielder Ray Sadler was the offensive leader, hitting .315 with 22 HR (second in the AA) and a league-leading 100 RBI. Outfielder Keanon Simon led the team with a .332 average and tied for the league lead with 16 triples, while catcher Kala Kaaihue tied Sadler with 22 homeruns. Kris Johnson finished third in the AA with a 3.23 ERA. The T-Bones, in their second year in the American Association, finished second in their division with a 51‚Äì49 record, but did not qualify for the 2012 playoffs. This was the first season for the T-Bones under Kenny Hook. The 2013 T-Bones finished in third in their division with a 40‚Äì60 record, posting the worst record in franchise history. After the season, manager Kenny Hook's contract was not renewed. In 2014, Kansas City's record improved to 48‚Äì52 under first- year manager John Massarelli, finishing third in the Central Division. The 2015 T-Bones were left in a distant second place with a 49‚Äì50 record, games behind Sioux City. In a tight 2016 Central Division that saw the top three teams finish two games apart, the T-Bones were the lone team left out of the division race, finishing in last place with a 42‚Äì58 record. Despite this, second baseman Brett Wiley was named a postseason American Association All- Star. John Massarelli did not return as manager after this season. Before the 2017 season, the T-Bones hired longtime Can-Am League manager Joe Calfapietra. The move paid immediate dividends as the T-Bones posted their best season since moving to the AA, finishing 57‚Äì43, tying the Gary SouthShore RailCats and Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks for the American Association wild card slot. The RailCats, however earned the playoff spot on a tiebreaker. Closer Cody Winiarski was named American Association Reliever of the Year. In 2018, the T-Bones posted their best season in franchise history, going 62‚Äì37. They finished games behind Sioux City, but ended games ahead of Wichita, securing their first playoff berth since moving to the American Association. They ousted Sioux City in five games, moving on to face St. Paul in the American Association finals, where the T-Bones prevailed in four games for their first AA crown and second league title in franchise history. Pitcher Tommy Collier led the league with 12 wins and 140 strikeouts, while Todd Cunningham was named an American Association Postseason All-Star. Joe Calfapietra earned the Manager of the Year Award. After trailing by ten games in late July 2019, the T-Bones rallied to capture their first division title, winning the South Division with a 58‚Äì42 record, one game ahead of both Sioux City and the Cleburne Railroaders. In the playoffs, Sioux City eliminated Kansas City in four games. Following years of sliding attendance and mounting debt, the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas evicted the T-Bones from T-Bones Stadium on October 14, 2019, for failure to pay nearly US$700,000 of rent and utility payments. Days later, the Unified Government approved a stadium lease with an organization trying to purchase the T-Bones. The purchase was completed, and the new five-year lease has three five-year options. In 2020, the league announced that the T-Bones were not selected as one of six teams to participate in a condensed season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They went on hiatus for the season, with plans to return in 2021. The T-Bones partnered with the Unified Government and the Kansas City Royals, the Major League Baseball franchise across the river in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri, to host a group of Royals players and coaches at T-Bones Stadium as the club's \\"alternate training site\\" for summer training.

They are entitled to syndicate the loan or bond issue, and may be referred to as the \\"lead underwriter\\". This is because this entity bears the risk of being able to sell the underlying securities/debt or the cost of holding it on its books until such time in the future that they may be sold. They do not necessarily acquire all the debt - this may be split into various parts and sold to a variety of Arrangers. Prior to the syndication of a loan and at the point where the loan documentation is signed, the title of \\"Bookrunner\\" is allocated to the bank that commits to provide the loan. This may be shared amongst several investors depending on the size of the deal. The \\"Arranger\\" is the entity (or entities) that subsequently agrees and negotiates the project financing structure. They will not necessarily be the same entity, although they often are. Upon final signing of the full syndicate, the Bookrunner title may be forfeited to another lender. If amendments are made to the loan, the banks that committed to the original loan may retain their involvement in the deal as \\"Mandated Arrangers\\". The Bookrunner title is then assigned to the banks comprising the new lender group. A bank may also be referred to as a \\"lead arranger\\", implying that they are more senior in the hierarchy of Arrangers involved in the deal.

He has been frequently depicted as an adversary of the X-Men. A mutant, Shaw possesses the ability to absorb energy and transform it into his own raw strength. He is the leader of the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, an exclusive secret society composed of mutants bent on world domination, although to the public, he is a legitimate businessman and ordinary human. He once funded the mutant-hunting Sentinel program to keep it under his thumb. In 2009, Shaw was ranked as IGN's 55th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.Sebastian Shaw is number 55 IGN. Retrieved 10-05-09. Kevin Bacon played the character in the film X-Men: First Class. Publication history Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne, Sebastian Shaw first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980). John Byrne based the appearance of Sebastian Shaw on British actor Robert Shaw. Fictional character biography Sebastian Shaw was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His power first manifested shortly after he was accepted to engineering school and his father Jacob Shaw died after he contracted an incurable disease. Sebastian Shaw devoted himself to his studies and created Shaw Industries, becoming a millionaire by age 30 and a billionaire by age 40. Shaw is weak against Chaos magic, a power that is possessed by Scarlet Witch. =Joining the Hellfire Club= Shaw became engaged to a woman named Lourdes Chantel, also a mutant, and was soon initiated into the Hellfire Club thanks to his vast fortune along with Warren Worthington, Jr. (father of Archangel), Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Sir James Braddock (father of Captain Britain and Psylocke), having caught the attention of Ned Buckman, then White King of Hellfire Club's New York Branch. Shaw became part of the Council of the Chosen, earning the rank of Black Bishop. Lourdes did not trust Buckman, and feared that Shaw's ambition and the nature of the Hellfire Club would corrupt him.X-Men: Hellfire Club #4 =Taking over= Lourdes is soon killed by Sentinels in a battle. Upon discovering that Ned Buckman, the White King of the Council, is supporting Steven Lang's Project: Armageddon and its Sentinels, he executes a coup, using Emma Frost's telepathy to make Buckman kill all the Council of the Chosen, including his own White Queen, Paris Seville, and then himself. Shaw proclaims himself Black King, remakes the Council of the Chosen into his Inner Circle and gathers Emma Frost, Harry Leland and the non-mutant cyborg Donald Pierce as the Lords Cardinal of Hellfire Club.Classic X-Men #7, X-Men: Hellfire Club #4 At Shaw's side is Tessa, who, unbeknownst to him, is a spy working for Charles Xavier. As the leader of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, Shaw starts plans to dominate the world through force, money and power. His connections to top officials of corporations and government, acquired via the Club and through his position as CEO of Shaw Industries, make him a powerful enemy. Shaw becomes a major supporter and builder of Sentinels. This activity brings him into frequent contact with the major players of Project: Wideawake, Senator Robert Kelly and Henry Peter Gyrich, to whom he appears to be an anti- mutant bigot.X-Men #135, 142 =Meeting the X-Men= Shaw sets his eyes on the X-Men, scheming to capture and study them for use in breeding an army of powerful mutants for the Hellfire Club. He employs the superpowered assassin Warhawk to plant a bug in Cerebro, ensuring the Hellfire Club would be aware of newly manifested mutants at the same moment as the X-Men themselves, as well as giving them access to secret details of their powers and fighting techniques.X-Men #110, 129 However, the Club's operatives prove ineffective at defeating the X-Men in the field, and the first two mutants they locate in this manner are lost.X-Men #129-131 Now aware of the Hellfire Club's existence, the X-Men infiltrate their headquarters, where they are defeated and captured. However, they escape before Shaw can put them to use.X-Men #132-134 Shaw's control of the Hellfire Club grows more tenuous as Pierce proves to be a mutant-hating traitor to the ClubMarvel Graphic Novel #4: The New Mutants and a new recruit to the Inner Circle, Selene, sets her sights on replacing Shaw as the chairman.New Mutants #23 The Hellfire Club is forced to battle alongside the X-Men against Nimrod, a Sentinel from the future, and though victorious, two key members perish in the fight. After the battle, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men become allies of sorts, with Magneto and Storm filling the position of White King.X-Men #208-210, New Mutants #51 Arguing that Shaw's support of the Sentinels is endangering the Inner Circle, Magneto, Selene and Emma vote him out of the Club.New Mutants #75 =Keeping in power= Months later, Shaw was attacked by his son, Shinobi Shaw, who phased his hand into his father's chest to induce a coronary. Shaw was then supposedly blown up in his Swiss Mountain chalet by a bomb set by his son.X-Factor (Vol. 1) #67 Shinobi shortly became the new Black King of Hellfire Club; however, Shaw survived, albeit with a scar on his face crossing his left eye,X-Force (Vol. 1) #48-50 which was removed successfully by Madelyne Pryor (seemingly a sentient psionic construct of X-Man) using her psionic powers during their affair after his reappearance. Shaw became part of a new Inner Circle alongside Selene, Madelyne and Trevor Fitzroy, a descendant of Sebastian himself in an alternate future.X-Man #15, 21-25 Shaw's first move upon recovery from the bomb was to contact the mutant named Holocaust, who had crossed over from the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" timeline. In exchange for a new armored containment suit, Holocaust agreed to help Shaw capture X-Force, which he did with ease. Shaw then had Tessa telepathically brainwash X-Force to hunt down Cable, but Cable used his own emergent telepathy to break the conditioning and free his team. Shaw's relationship with Holocaust declined soon after. Shaw's more recent exploits included vying for control of the Elixir Vitae, thought to be a cure for the Legacy Virus; associations with the British intelligence agency Black Air and an unnamed time-manipulator; and hunting down X-51, the Machine Man. Then, Shaw was apparently ousted from his position as Black King by Selene, who installed the demon Blackheart in his place. This arrangement did not last long, as Selene and Blackheart were defeated and Shaw has since returned to power. He attempted to use Lady Mastermind to control Tessa (now called \\"Sage\\") and Storm's team of X-Men, who were searching for Destiny's prophetic diaries. Then, after Professor X was \\"outed\\" as a mutant, Shaw apparently returned to his capitalist roots and converted the NY branch of the Hellfire Club into a strip club, which was in fact a safe haven for mutants regardless of affiliation. Using telepathic strippers, Shaw gleaned secrets from the minds of his patrons, who come in just to have a good decadent time. Thanks to the aid of his employees, Shaw pretended to be a telepath himself. After a few months, though, Shaw made a play to become the new Lord Imperial of the entire Club worldwide, and invited Sage to help him. Shaw also invited Courtney Ross (who was actually her evil counterpart Sat-Yr-9) and Sunspot to join him as the White Queen and Black King. All three accepted, but Sage effectively betrayed Shaw when she did not warn him that Pierce might try to assassinate him. Shaw met with the X-Men, claiming to be somewhat reformed, just before Pierce's attack. He was then wounded by Pierce, but remained strong enough to literally knock Pierce's head off. However, he was too hurt to maintain his Club position and was replaced by Sunspot, who is now the current Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club. =Illusion= Later, it seemed he had joined forces with a new Inner Circle which included Cassandra Nova, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Emma Frost/Perfection, the latter of whom had since joined the X-Men. As the story arc continued to unfold, the Hellfire Club made their attack as they each targeted an individual member of Cyclops' team of X-Men. Shaw himself defeated Colossus. In the end however, it is revealed that the entire Hellfire Club was not real, and all were mental images created by Emma Frost's mind, which was infected with a special \\"programming\\" by Cassandra Nova in an attempt to revive her. The Shaw duplicate vanished after being defeated by Cyclops. =X-Men: Endangered Species= Shaw appears incognito (with an image-inducer) at a funeral for a mutant boy named Landru. When confronted by Professor X, he merely states that he was paying his respects. Xavier overhears his thoughts of a possible coup against Sunspot during the service. When Shaw notices him watching, he quickly creates a Psi-Shield to hide his thoughts. =Mister Sinister and the Cronus Machine= Some time after this Shaw appears at a Hellfire Club dinner hosted by Sunspot and is alerted to a device left to him by his father exploding elsewhere in the compound resulting in the insanity of two club menials and Shaw asking his manservant for a file labelled \\"Kronos\\". After being upbraided over the explosion and deaths by da Costa he is ordered to investigate. Shaw however knows the cause. The explosion in the Hellfire Club was caused by the activation of a machine developed beneath the Alamogordo genetics plant in Las Cruces, New Mexico by Mr. Sinister. In the past Sinister had worked here (disguised as a Dr. Milbury) alongside Brian Xavier, Kurt Marko and Irene Adler who had been gathered for him by Jacob Shaw, Sebastian's father, as they all had the X-gene and Sinister predicted their children would be mutants. Sinister then experimented of these children (including Cain Marko, Charles Xavier and Sebastian himself), imprinting himself on their DNA. Sinister's machine, dubbed the Cronus device, was designed to activate soon after his death and would activate these hidden copies until Sinister could be reborn in one of them. Jacob, wanting to protect his son, created the device in the Hellfire Club from Sinister's notes to alert and protect Sebastian from the Cronus device. Shaw travelled to New Mexico to visit another of the children to confirm his theory, running into Xavier and Gambit who were investigating a hit list with the children's names on it. Following them he is present when they are attacked by mercenaries under the employ of Amanda Mueller, a former associate of Sinister's. Xavier is captured and Gambit and Shaw team up to save Xavier. It is revealed that Mueller wants to house the powers (though not the personality) of Sinister herself and so is assassinating the children, having undergone the procedure herself. She shoots Xavier, who is already struggling to stop Sinister from taking over his body, which allows him to take over. Sinister in Xavier's body stops Mueller but is in turn confronted by Shaw and Gambit who destroy the Cronus device while Xavier casts Sinister out of his mind. With the threat gone, Shaw leaves. =Original Sin= Later, Shaw joins forces with Claudine Renko, a.k.a. Miss Sinister, a female clone of Mister Sinister. Together they manipulate Wolverine into defeating the new members of the Inner Circle, try to take control of Logan's son, Daken, and set up a trap against Xavier. Shaw also attempts to kill Xavier but is stopped by Daken. Shaw is eventually confronted by Wolverine and begins to fight. Shaw's powers initially protect him from being injured by Wolverine's adamantium claws, allowing him to fare extremely well. The ending of the fight takes place off panel and Wolverine appears with his body and claws soaked with blood, which he soon confirms belongs to Shaw. =Dark Reign= During her early days as the White Queen, Sebastian Shaw sends Emma to convince Namor to join the Hellfire Club. Instead, Namor takes her to his kingdom and they begin a relationship. Believing Emma to have betrayed him for Namor, Shaw sends a reprogrammed Sentinel to Atlantis, attacking the two and destroying the kingdom. As Namor confronts Shaw for his treachery, Selene takes telepathic hold of Emma, erasing her memories of Namor, who vows revenge on Shaw. In the present, Emma reveals that her initial battle with Phoenix unlocked her memories of Namor. She makes a pact with him, seducing Shaw and using her telepathy to make Namor believe she has executed him, while secretly telepathically incapacitating Shaw. Per their deal, Namor vows to protect mutant-kind as his own people, while Emma, more determined to fill her role as a leader of mutant-kind, contacts Cyclops to have Shaw captured by the X-Men for \\"crimes against mutant-kind.\\"Uncanny X-Men Annual (Vol. 2) #2 Approaching him later in his cell, Emma reveals that she has captured Shaw for Namor and on the basis that the Sentinels he commissioned were ones later used by Cassandra Nova to destroy Genosha. She sentences him to remember nothing but the faces of the Genoshan victims using her telepathy.Uncanny X-Men (Vol. 1) #507 =Necrosha= Shaw is targeted by Selene along with all those who failed her in her attempt to ascend to godhood. It is revealed that sometime after M-Day he had his son, Shinobi Shaw killed. Selene sends Shinobi and Harry Leland after Shaw and Donald Pierce.X-Necrosha #1 =Utopia= Due to Namor's presence on Utopia, Emma realizes that Shaw's continued existence poses a threat to the agreement she had made with Namor earlier. She decides to finally kill him, but her plans are exposed when Shadowcat accidentally picks up her thoughts during a psi-conversation between her and Colossus. While disgusted at Frost's intended actions, Shadowcat offers her a compromise. As she currently exists as a ghost, she is the perfect tool for making Shaw disappear. Fantomex, Shadowcat and Emma then take him aboard E.V.A., whilst they work out how to dispose of him. Emma wakes Shaw up and asks him to recount the early days of the Hellfire Club. Emma and two other dancers were the closest of friends, when one night, Emma was offered, by Shaw, the position of Queen. The only stipulation was that one of the two girls had to die. She stated she did not care which one was killed and watched as Shaw proceeded to kill both. Present day, Emma starts to question Shaw further when Fantomex, bored with Emma's \\"woe is me\\" recounts of her history, drops the floor from under Shaw. Emma goes into a rage at Fantomex, as Fantomex was unaware that Shaw could absorb energy, such as that from hitting the ground from such heights.Uncanny X-Men #531 Shaw proceeds to engage Frost's group, stating that he would rather die than see Emma go on breathing a moment longer. Helped by a maimed Fantomex, the former White Queen tricks Shaw into allowing her into his mind, and (with a little encouragement from Shadowcat), as opposed to killing him, finds the most landlocked place in his mind, the point safest from Namor's rage, and wipes his memory. Shaw's attitude immediately changes, and he seems to have no recollection of who he is, where he is, or the identities of anyone around him. In response to his asking who she is, Emma Frost simply rebuffs him, and asks him who \\"he\\" is, coldly telling him that he always said he was a \\"self-made man\\" and now is his chance to prove it. She then leaves with the rest of her expedition, leaving a pondering Shaw kneeling in the mud.[Uncanny X-Men #534 =Schism/Regenesis= Hope Summers and the Lights find Shaw, assuming him to be a new mutant. When they extract him and bring him back to Utopia, Cyclops is not exactly happy to see him.Generation Hope #14-15 (2012) =Avengers vs. X-Men= After the Avengers invaded Utopia as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, Shaw along with the kids in Utopia were taken to the Avengers Academy. It is revealed that Shaw read the file on him and now knows everything about his past although he claims not to remember it. Wolverine distrusts Shaw and insists that he should be imprisoned. Shaw relents and is imprisoned in a cell that absorbs kinetic energy, meaning that Shaw would be unable to break it by building up his own kinetic energy by punching it. Shaw however, asks for books to keep him occupied and uses a book to hit himself for 8 hours straight, allowing him to build up enough energy to break out of the cell and into the storm drain. Hercules, Tigra and Madison Jeffries try to stop him, but are quickly defeated. Elsewhere, the young mutants from Utopia, now joined by Ricochet, Wiz Kid and Hollow, confront the Academy students. Shortly after this, Shaw appears to the teenagers. Before a battle between both parties can become serious, X-23 and Finesse warn their friends that Shaw's body language indicates that he doesn't mean to hurt anyone, but to help the mutant children to escape. After both sides agree that the mutant children shouldn't be confined against their will, they fake a battle in order to justify their escape in front of the cameras at the Academy.Avengers Academy #31 (2012) =All-New, All-Different Marvel= As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Sebastian Shaw represented Shaw Industries when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Wilson Fisk of Fisk Industries, Darren Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Shingen Harada of the Yashida Corporation, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with Dario Agger about his and Roxxon Energy Corporation's plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Sebastian Shaw also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.Mighty Thor Vol. 2 #8 Powers and abilities Shaw is a mutant with the unique ability to absorb all kinetic and thermal energy directed at him and use it to augment his strength, speed, stamina and recuperation capabilities to superhuman levels. He absorbs the energy of any impact he is struck by, including not only direct physical blows, but also the impact of bullets and throwing weapons, and less successfully, concussive energy beams; notably Cyclops' optic blasts. By absorbing successive blows from an opponent, Shaw can surpass the physical abilities of said opponent and then overpower them. His speed is the attribute most dramatically increased by his power; after absorbing enough energy he can attack more quickly than opponents can react.X-Men #132. Marvel Comics. He is sometimes shown to be capable of absorbing the cutting, piercing and thrusting energy from a blade. His powers can enable his body to withstand cutting from adamantium, but only for a short time. In the past, Shaw has been limited to a certain amount of energy and would lose consciousness when he surpassed his capabilities. Subsequently, however, Shaw has been shown to now be able to take in an indefinite amount of energy without any ill effects.X-Men #152. Marvel Comics. The power he absorbs dissipates over time, and exposure to the elements causes it to drain rapidly.X-Men #134. Marvel Comics. Without any absorbed energy, Shaw is merely a strong ordinary human in excellent physical condition, but regularly works to keep his strength at a superhuman level. In one instance, he was shown to spend time hitting a wall after waking in order to build up his power reserves before starting the day. Shaw also can forgo sleep if he receives enough energy. Often he will have his mercenaries pummel him so that he would not need to sleep for some time. Shaw also has a successful business acumen and access to sophisticated weaponry. He not only prides himself on his power and the connections it allows him, but on knowing his opponents and how best to defeat them, whether in battle or in business. He also possesses technology that can block telepathic intrusions by Professor X.

In addition to absorbing any form of energy to avoid injury and augmenting his physical and healing parameters, he can utilize it as sustenance, keeping him rested and nourished. This metabolized energy also restores and sustains his youth and life, having looked the same since at least before World War II. He can also unleash the energy as charged and focused blasts of various levels, similar to Bishop. He is fluent in English, German, French, and Russian. In this version, he is first shown as a Nazi scientist using the alias Dr. Klaus Schmidt, where he put young Erik Lensherr through numerous experiments and murders his mother in an effort to get him to consciously use his ability.

She began her career as a child actress and subsequently became popular in the 1980s and 1990s for her roles in telenovelas, such as Estrellita m√≠a, Celeste, Antonella and Perla negra. She has also appeared in numerous films and several theatre productions. Del Boca has won three Mart√≠n Fierro Awards.  Career  Del Boca made her debut as a four-year-old in the TV series Nuestra galleguita where she played a deaf-mute girl. In 1970, she started to play in the series Alta comedia and won the prestigious Mart√≠n Fierro Award for 1971 in the Revelaci√≥n category, an equivalent of the Best New Artist. In 1972, she appeared in her first film, Hab√≠a una vez un circo, alongside a trio of popular clowns called Los Payasos de la Tele. She achieved a wide popularity in Argentina at the age of seven when she played the part of a little orphan Pinina in Pap√° coraz√≥n on Canal 13 in 1973. In the same year she appeared in the film Andrea, followed by a film adaptation of Pap√° coraz√≥n in 1974, Pap√° Coraz√≥n se quiere casar, and Un mundo de amor (A World of Love) in 1975. From 1979 to 1980 she played the leading role in the telenovela Andrea Celeste with Alberto Argibay, Ana Mar√≠a Picchio and Ra√∫l Taibo, and subsequently in Se√±orita Andrea, both broadcast on Argentine public television ATC. In the same year, she released her first music album. She then appeared in a number of TV miniseries on ATC throughout 1981. In 1982, she played the lead in Cien d√≠as de Ana alongside actor and singer Silvestre, and relocated to New York to study acting. In the following years, she took part in several theatrical productions. In 1987, she returned in the telenovela Estrellita m√≠a on the Telefe network, with Ricardo Dar√≠n as her partner. She recorded two music albums for Warner Music Group, Con amor and Te amo, released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. In 1991, Del Boca played the title role in Celeste on Canal 13, alongside Gustavo Berm√∫dez. The telenovela was one of the precursors in the genre addressing such topics as HIV/AIDS and homosexuality, and was popular with the TV audience. In 1992, she starred in Antonella, again accompanied by Berm√∫dez. In this series, she contributed the theme song \\"Para este amor\\" and portrayed a charismatic heroine, very different from the ones she had played in previous telenovelas. In 1993, she appeared in the film Funes, a Great Love directed by Ra√∫l de la Torre, where she played an alcoholic lesbian prostitute. In the same year, Celeste was resumed as Celeste siempre Celeste, in which Del Boca played a double role: Celeste and her sister, Clara. In late 1994, she appeared in the telenovela Perla negra on Telefe alongside Argentine sex symbol Gabriel Corrado. It was another success and was popular also internationally. The series featured Del Boca's song \\"El amor\\" as the musical theme, taken from her new album of the same name, recorded for Philips Records. Her next film, de la Torre-directed Peperina, was released in 1995, but received negative feedback from the critics. In 1996, Del Boca was reunited with Corrado as the main characters in Z√≠ngara, which also used her song \\"Tonta, pobre tonta\\" as the music theme. The telenovela was a story of a young woman experiencing amnesia and being raised as a gypsy, but failed to repeat the success of Del Boca's previous series. Her next telenovela, M√≠a s√≥lo m√≠a, premiered in 1997, but did not turn out a big success either. Del Boca subsequently limited her television activity and in 1998 only made a guest appearance in the series Chiquititas. Del Boca in 1999 In 2000, she returned to film in the romantic comedy Apariencias directed by Alberto Lecchi, and from 2001 to 2002, she played the main character in the TV series El sodero de mi vida. Her role in the latter earned her the second Mart√≠n Fierro Award, this time for the Best Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2005, she was honoured with a special Mart√≠n Fierro Award and played the title role in the telenovela S√°lvame Mar√≠a on Canal 9 which was filmed entirely in San Luis Province. The following year she starred in the short series Gladiadores de Pompeya. In 2007, she appeared in one episode of the series Mujeres asesinas and joined the judging panel of a TV show selecting the cast for the Argentine version of High School Musical in which she also played a small role. In 2008, she hosted a popular TV show La mam√° del a√±o which revolved around motherhood and joined the series Por amor a vos as a recurring character. She also started presenting another TV show, Hoy puede ser. In 2010, she starred in the telenovela Alguien que me quiera alongside Osvaldo Laport, but the production did not achieve expected ratings. In 2011, she took part in the theatre play Eva y Victoria in which she portrayed Eva Per√≥n, alongside Graciela Dufau who played Victoria Ocampo. The play was taken on a tour in Argentina. In autumn Del Boca premiered Tiempo de pensar, a TV series she co-produced and starred in, tackling the issue of gender violence, stereotypes and female representation in the media. Between 2013 and 2014, she starred in the telenovela Esa mujer, which she also produced. The role earned her a nomination to a Mart√≠n Fierro Award. In 2016, it was reported that Del Boca had acquired as much as 36 million Argentine pesos from public funds to produce her next telenovela, Mam√° coraz√≥n. It caused a major controversy and a backlash against the actress, and even though the series was almost completed, it was never aired. In 2019, she appeared in another theatre play, Brujas, with Leonora Balcarce, Andrea Bonelli, Romina Ricci and Viviana Saccone, which was a critical and commercial success.  Personal life  Her parents are the actress and dancer Ana Mar√≠a Castro and the film director Nicol√°s del Boca. She has two siblings: brother Adri√°n, working as a doctor in the United States, and sister Anabella who is a costume designer. In 1982, she began a five-year relationship with Argentine actor and singer Silvestre (Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez, not to be confused with the Venezuelan singer of the same name) whom she had met while working on the series Cien d√≠as de Ana. Their relationship sparked controversy as Silvestre was 12 years older than Andrea who was still underage. Moreover, Silvestre was married at that time and his wife was pregnant. From 1988 to 1995 Andrea's partner was Argentine filmmaker Ra√∫l de la Torre, and from 1995 to 1997 she was involved with American financier Jeffrey Sachs. In 2000, the actress was briefly dating the businessman Ricardo Biasotti and gave birth to their daughter Anna Chiara Biasotti on 15 November 2000. She is a supporter of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner.

And constant \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\,}} is the normalizing constant of function p(x). Similarly, :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^n}{n!}=e^\\\\lambda , and consequently :f(n)=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^n e^{-\\\\lambda}}{n!} is a probability mass function on the set of all nonnegative integers.Feller, 1968, p. 156. This is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution with expected value Œª. Note that if the probability density function is a function of various parameters, so too will be its normalizing constant. The parametrised normalizing constant for the Boltzmann distribution plays a central role in statistical mechanics. In that context, the normalizing constant is called the partition function. Bayes' theorem Bayes' theorem says that the posterior probability measure is proportional to the product of the prior probability measure and the likelihood function. Proportional to implies that one must multiply or divide by a normalizing constant to assign measure 1 to the whole space, i.e., to get a probability measure. In a simple discrete case we have :P(H_0D) = \\\\frac{P(DH_0)P(H_0)}{P(D)} where P(H0) is the prior probability that the hypothesis is true; P(DH0) is the conditional probability of the data given that the hypothesis is true, but given that the data are known it is the likelihood of the hypothesis (or its parameters) given the data; P(H0D) is the posterior probability that the hypothesis is true given the data. P(D) should be the probability of producing the data, but on its own is difficult to calculate, so an alternative way to describe this relationship is as one of proportionality: :P(H_0D) \\\\propto P(DH_0)P(H_0). Since P(HD) is a probability, the sum over all possible (mutually exclusive) hypotheses should be 1, leading to the conclusion that :P(H_0D) = \\\\frac{P(DH_0)P(H_0)}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_i P(DH_i)P(H_i)} . In this case, the reciprocal of the value :P(D)=\\\\sum_i P(DH_i)P(H_i) \\\\; is the normalizing constant.Feller, 1968, p. 124. It can be extended from countably many hypotheses to uncountably many by replacing the sum by an integral. Non- probabilistic uses The Legendre polynomials are characterized by orthogonality with respect to the uniform measure on the interval [‚àí 1, 1] and the fact that they are normalized so that their value at 1 is 1. The constant by which one multiplies a polynomial so its value at 1 is 1 is a normalizing constant. Orthonormal functions are normalized such that :\\\\langle f_i , \\\\, f_j\\\\rangle = \\\\, \\\\delta_{i,j} with respect to some inner product . The constant 1/ is used to establish the hyperbolic functions cosh and sinh from the lengths of the adjacent and opposite sides of a hyperbolic triangle.

(Bert) Claster and Nancy Claster (Goldman) as Romper Room Inc. It was originally a producer of the children's show Romper Room, one of the first pre-school children's programs. Production Romper Room was fairly successful in its early years. CBS offered to pick up the show, but the Clasters instead decided to syndicate and franchise it, by taping episodes and selling the tapes to local stations or giving the option to local stations to produce their own version of the show. In 1969, Hasbro bought Romper Room Inc. and renamed it Claster Television Productions. Throughout the 1970s, Claster continued to make Romper Room and did not distribute anything else until 1978 when it brought the Japanese animated television series Star Blazers into the United States. It also developed the television series Bowling for Dollars. In the 1980s, Hasbro formed contracts with animation studios to make cartoons that would promote the sale of Hasbro's toys. In 1983, Claster distributed the animated series G.I. Joe, which was fairly successful. A year later, Claster distributed The Transformers, which was a major success for Hasbro and Claster. G.I. Joe ended in 1987, while The Transformers left off airing new run episodes in the United States, but continued to air for some time in Japan under the supervision of Takara, the Japanese rightsholder to the Transformers franchise. Beginning in 1989, Claster distributed a G.I. Joe cartoon series sequel that was made by DIC Entertainment. This ended in 1991. Romper Room finally was ended in 1994 due to loss of interest and popularity, giving the program a run of 41 years. Romper Room had been the longest-running children's show in history to date, a record that Sesame Street passed in 2010. In 1996, Claster syndicated ReBoot, the first all-CGI television show, for a short time after it was cancelled by ABC. At the same time, they distributed a CGI revival of Transformers known as Beast Wars until 1999 (Its sequel, Beast Machines, would air on Fox Kids). Claster released The Mr. Potato Head Show in 1998, which was another attempt to sell Hasbro toys. All of Claster's shows ended in 2000, when Hasbro formed a central media division, eventually becoming then Allspark division which ultimately folded into Entertainment One.

Pioneering can be used for constructing small items such as camp gadgets up to larger structures such as bridges and towers. These may be recreational, decorative, or functional. Pioneering is used to teach practical skills, teamwork and problem solving. It is widely used in Scouting and Girl Guiding. Many Scout and Guide groups train their members in pioneering skills and construct projects, both small and large. In camp, they may construct functional items like tables, camp dressers and gadgets, as well as decorative camp gateways. Pioneering is a common merit badge in many countries, and was required for the Eagle Scout rank in the 1920s and 1930s. The name comes from the 18th and 19th century military engineers who went ahead of an army to \\"pioneer\\" a route, which could involve building bridges and towers with rope and timber (for example the Royal Pioneer Corps). Pioneering skills include knot tying (tying ropes together), lashing (tying spars together with rope), whipping (binding the end of a rope with thin twine), splicing (joining or binding the end of a rope using its own fibres), and skills related to the use, care and storage of ropes, spars and related pioneering equipment. Basic knots monkey bridge under construction There are a number of basic knots used in pioneering: * Bowline * Clove hitch * Reef knot * Sheet bend * Timber hitch * Common whipping There are also a number of specialized pioneering knots that are used to add safety and functionality to pioneering projects: * Butterfly Loop * Carrick Bend * Rolling hitch * Roundturn and Two Half Hitches Basic lashings * Square lashing, which gets its name from the fact the wraps are ‚Äúsquare‚Äù to the poles.

The horizontal member of the A-frame also makes a convenient springing point for a deck such as a table-top. * Trestle: Used as a modular element for building bridges and towers. Also used as a 'chariot' for inter-Patrol chariot races. Often referred to as X-Trestle or H-Trestle * Tripod: As end supports for swingbridges, dining tables, etc. and as the basis for the hourglass tower.

Drive-time periods are when the number of radio listeners in this class is at its peak and, thus, commercial radio can generate the most revenue from advertising. Drive time usually coincides with rush hour. Content Mainstream stations employ high-status presenters for drive time shows. In the United States, popular national hosts who are associated with morning drive include Howard Stern, Ryan Seacrest and Steve Inskeep, while Sean Hannity is associated with afternoon drive on the East Coast. Drive time often includes a heavier run of traffic reports, for which many stations employ their own helicopters or hire a third-party traffic reporting service. For popular music-oriented stations, morning drive-time is typically dominated by the \\"morning zoo\\" genre of radio program, with the afternoon portion is often given over to music (often in commercial-free blocks, especially in markets with long commute times) and light entertainment features. For talk radio stations, drive time is characterized by regular news updates, as well as extremely frequent updates on traffic and weather forecasts to help commuters get to and from work. Primary news radio stations are almost always local during this time period. Variations In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term drive time is used almost exclusively to refer to the peak evening period (most commonly 16:00-19:00); the term used for the period of peak morning listening is breakfast, akin to the phrase breakfast television used for morning TV shows. In circumstances where the phrase drive time may be ambiguous, the term home time may also be used for afternoon drive. In the United States drive time consists of the morning hours when listeners wake up, get ready, and head to work or school, and the afternoon hours when they are heading home and before their evening meal. The exact times vary: morning drive times typically include 6‚Äì10 a.m.; afternoon drive times typically include 3‚Äì7 p.m. In the United States, these are the time slots as defined by Nielsen Audio for audience measurement. Drive time programming is almost exclusively restricted to during the work week. On weekends, because driving habits are much less uniform, lower profile programs (often reruns or brokered programming) typically air in the respective time slots. =Multiple time zones= Depending on the station, morning drive can start as early as 5 a.m. local time, although rarely any earlier. Because the contiguous United States, Canada, and Mexico span four to seven time zones, what constitutes drive time on one coast does not broadcast in drive time on the other, which can cause issues for nationally syndicated programs; this is not as much of an issue in morning drive, which usually incorporates a tape delay to air at the same time in all time zones, as it is for afternoon drive. However this effectively means that morning shows are heavily New York or East Coast‚Äìcentric to allow time-shifting in all time zones, with some Central Time Zone shows making some additional headway. For all intents and purposes though, morning shows originating west of the Rockies must additionally plan to be mid-morning offerings for the rest of the country and adjust accordingly to be office- appropriate for those stations which take the shows in the east. National satellite networks typically air their morning drive programs from 6‚Äì11 a.m. Eastern Time, with heavy repetition. A similar situation exists in Russia, which spans nine time zones. This issue is mitigated somewhat in Canada and Mexico, where most drive time programs are local and are unaffected by these problems. These issues are not present in the United Kingdom or New Zealand, where the entire country is in the same time zone. In Australia, there is a two-hour time zone difference between the eastern and western coasts; and three time zones; however, other than Greater Perth, most of the country's population is located in the southern and eastern portions of the country, and its time zones are only a half-hour apart.

Early in his career, he performed as a journeyman musician with such luminaries as Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, Stuff Smith, Charlie Christian, Big Joe Turner, T-Bone Walker, Nat King Cole and Roy Milton. Following his rediscovery by drummer Joey Covington in 1967, he fronted a variety of bands (including Zulu and Midnight Sun) in addition to playing with Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna, Jefferson Starship, the San Francisco All-Stars (1979‚Äì1984), The Dinosaurs (1982‚Äì1989) and Steve Taylor. Creach recorded a number of solo albums and guested at several Grateful Dead and Charlie Daniels Band concerts. He was a regular guest at the early annual Volunteer Jams, hosted by Charlie Daniels, which exposed him to a new audience that was receptive to fiddle players.Volunteer Jam compilations III and IV Life and career Creach was born at Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. As a child, he was introduced to the violin by an uncle, and he received both tutoring in the instrument and conservatory training. He began playing violin in Chicago bars after his family moved there in 1935, and also did some symphonic work when he was in his early 20s, which was unusual for a black musician at the time. At one point, he joined a local cabaret trio called the Chocolate Music Bars, and toured the Midwest with them. According to Creach, knowing how to play in a variety of style was a necessity to survive as a musician in Chicago at the time: > [B]ecause of all the nationalities [there], I had to learn to play > everything. At some jobs it was strictly German music, or Polish. Now, they > used to dance and knock holes in the floor. He had some difficulty in learning to play jazz violin, having to adjust his bowing technique, but was helped when he purchased an electric violin in 1943. Moving to Los Angeles in 1945, he played in the Chi Chi Club, worked on an ocean liner for five years, appeared in several films, including with Nat King Cole in Fritz Lang's The Blue Gardenia,Washburn, Jim (May 25, 1990) \\"In Touch, in Tune : Papa John Creach Continues a Career That's Ranged from Armstrong to the Airplane\\" Los Angeles Times and performed as a duo with Nina Russell. Creach initially met and befriended drummer Joey Covington at a union hiring hall in Los Angeles in 1967. When Covington joined Jefferson Airplane in 1970, he introduced Creach to them. In the fall of 1970, he was invited to join both Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady's side band. He remained with both groups while also recording and touring as a solo artist for Jefferson Airplane's Grunt Records. During this period, his backing band Zulu included guitarist Keb' Mo'. Creach left Hot Tuna in 1973, but remained on board when Jefferson Airplane was reorganized as Jefferson Starship in 1974. He toured and recorded with Jefferson Starship from 1974 to 1975, a period that included platinum selling album Red Octopus (1975). In August 1975, Creach left the band to focus on his solo career. Nevertheless, he remained on amicable terms with the group and briefly returned as a touring member for the band's spring 1978 engagements. A year later, Creach renewed his working relationship with Covington as a member of the San Francisco All- Stars. He also performed with Covington's Airplane predecessor Spencer Dryden as a member of The Dinosaurs. Creach continued to make occasional guest appearances with Hot Tuna. He was performing with them at the Fillmore Auditorium in 1988 when Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen of Hot Tuna reunited with Paul Kantner and Grace Slick for the first time on stage since 1972. In 1992, Creach joined Kantner as a member of the relaunched Jefferson Starship and performed with them until he succumbed to congestive heart failure on February 22, 1994. A heart condition had been causing bouts of pneumonia from continual fluid build-up in his lungs.

He is a mutant and foe of Cable and Wolverine. He first appeared in a flashback in X-Force #1 (1991). His first appearance as \\"Mister Tolliver\\" is in X-Force #5 (1992) and his first appearance as Genesis was in Cable vol 1 #19. Some sources state that he is actually Cable's son, while others state that he is Cable's 'nephew' since his father was Stryfe. Fictional character biography Tyler Dayspring was born two thousand years in the future as the son of Nathan Summers and his wife Aliya Summers (though some accounts claim that Nathan was not the actual father and has adopted Tyler). He was raised by the Summers as part of the Askani Clan Chosen. As a young teenager, Tyler was abducted by the villain Stryfe and corrupted. He reappeared as one of Stryfe's soldiers and took Dawnsilk, a friend of Nathan, as a hostage. Seeing no other solution, Nathan shot Tyler, freeing Dawnsilk (though she received brain damage from the mental link between her and Tyler). Tyler was thought to be dead, but he survived and escaped from Stryfe's service. He had grown bitter against his father for shooting him. He used time travel to come to the present, following his father. He created the identity of \\"Tolliver\\", an illegal weapons merchant who always appeared wearing a rubber mask. \\"Mister Tolliver\\" was initially an unseen character, as his face (actually his mask) was never fully shown. Tyler wanted to punish everybody who had ever hurt him, first and foremost his father, who was now calling himself Cable. He hired the Six Pack, his father's group of mercenaries, and sent them on a mission that would bring them into conflict with Stryfe, who had also traveled back in time. This mission would result in the Six Pack disbanding and most of the members hating Cable afterwards. After the Six Pack disbanded, Cable became part of New Mutants, turning them into X-Force. During this time, Cable told Cannonball about Tyler, but said he was just a friend who had joined Stryfe's Mutant Liberation Front and was killed on a mission. Tolliver hired the mercenary Deadpool and his girlfriend Copycat to kidnap Domino. Copycat took Domino's place and infiltrated X-force, but she was later found out and Cable freed Domino. In the fight, Tolliver's helicopter exploded and many assumed that Tolliver had died.X-force volume 1 #15 Various mercenaries began looking for Tolliver's legacy, known only as the ultimate weapon. It turned out to be the futuristic android Zero. After the X-Cutioner's Song, Stryfe's body was destroyed and Cable returned from the future. Cable told X-Force the truth about Tyler being his son. He also found out from the cyborg Sinsear that Tolliver had been another time-traveler, known simply as \\"the Other\\", who had come from the same future. Tyler, now working with Zero, used his mutant powers to discover the truth about the exact relationship between Cable and Stryfe. He revealed this knowledge to Cable, who was possessed by Stryfe's spirit. The truth that Stryfe was a clone of Cable, was too much for Stryfe to bear and Cable was released, while Stryfe's spirit died. Tyler disappeared with Zero, but Zero left him shortly afterward. Under his \\"Genesis\\" identity, Tyler considered himself the new heir of Apocalypse and chose Wolverine to turn him into a Horseman of Apocalypse. He attempted to erase Wolverine's mind and re-bond adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton. On both accounts he failed; Wolverine's mutation was sent into overdrive and he reverted into a feral state. Wolverine killed Genesis.Wolverine volume 2 #100 During a near-death experience, Cable met the spirit of his son, who told him that he had found peace in the afterlife, but this may have been a hallucination on Cable's part. It is revealed that the Sports Arena on Cable's Providence Island is named \\"The Tyler Dayspring Stadium\\" after him.X-Men vol. 2 #198 Powers and abilities Tyler Dayspring was a mutant with the ability to form a psionic link with another consciousness and visually project those memories as solid holograms. As Genesis, he absorbed the energy of many mutants to increase his power, but he never displayed any increased mutant powers afterwards; instead, somewhat like his father, he relied on powered armor and advanced weaponry. His first appearance, drawn by Rob Liefeld, has Tyler has dark hair, but all his later appearances have Tyler as blond. In other media * An action figure of Genesis was produced by Toy Biz as part of the merged X-Men/X-Force line. He was packaged with a miniature version of Spyne. * Tyler Dayspring appeared in the animated X-Men series. This version was depicted as Cable's young son, and fellow Clan Chosen member as an adult, and helps his father in obtaining a time machine, which would help stop Apocalypse. Tyler appeared in the multi- part episodes \\"Time Fugitives\\" and \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\". * Genesis is a playing piece in the Heroclix game system.

Schnittke's early music shows the strong influence of Dmitri Shostakovich. He developed a polystylistic technique in works such as the epic Symphony No. 1 (1969‚Äì1972) and his first concerto grosso (1977). In the 1980s, Schnittke's music began to become more widely known abroad with the publication of his second (1980) and third (1983) string quartets and the String Trio (1985); the ballet Peer Gynt (1985‚Äì1987); the third (1981), fourth (1984), and fifth (1988) symphonies; and the viola concerto (1985) and first cello concerto (1985‚Äì1986). As his health deteriorated, Schnittke's music started to abandon much of the extroversion of his polystylism and retreated into a more withdrawn, bleak style. Life and career Schnittke's father, (1914‚Äì1975), was Jewish and born in Frankfurt.Interviews with Alfred Schnittke.; Alfred Schnittke: a crazy mixed- up kid He moved to the Soviet Union in 1927 and worked as a journalist and translator from the Russian language into German. His mother, Maria Iosifovna Schnittke (n√©e Vogel, 1910‚Äì1972), was a Volga German born in Russia. Schnittke's paternal grandmother, Tea Abramovna Katz (1889‚Äì1970), was a philologist, translator, and editor of German-language literature. Reginald Gray (1972) Alfred Schnittke was born in Engels in the Volga-German Republic of the Russian SFSR. He began his musical education in 1946 in Vienna, where his father had been posted. It was in Vienna, Schnittke's biographer Alexander Ivashkin writes, where \\"he fell in love with music which is part of life, part of history and culture, part of the past which is still alive.\\" \\"I felt every moment there,\\" the composer wrote, \\"to be a link of the historical chain: all was multi-dimensional; the past represented a world of ever-present ghosts, and I was not a barbarian without any connections, but the conscious bearer of the task in my life.\\"As quoted in Schnittke's experience in Vienna \\"gave him a certain spiritual experience and discipline for his future professional activities. It was Mozart and Schubert, not Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, whom he kept in mind as a reference point in terms of taste, manner and style. This reference point was essentially Classical ... but never too blatant.\\" In 1948, the family moved to Moscow. Schnittke completed his graduate work in composition at the Moscow Conservatory in 1961 and taught there from 1962 to 1972. Evgeny Golubev was one of his composition teachers. Thereafter, he earned his living chiefly by composing film scores, producing nearly 70 scores in 30 years. Schnittke converted to Christianity and possessed deeply held mystic beliefs, which influenced his music.–í. –Æ. –ì–∞–≤—Ä–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞ ¬´–ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ê–ª—å—Ñ—Ä–µ–¥–∞ –®–Ω–∏—Ç–∫–µ (–∫ 80-–ª–µ—Ç–∏—é —Å–æ –¥–Ω—è —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è)¬ª [V.

His First Symphony was effectively banned by the Composers' Union.A Schnittke Reader. Edited by Alexander Ivashkin. Indiana University Press, 2002. After he abstained from a Composers' Union vote in 1980, he was banned from travelling outside the USSR. On 21 July 1985, Schnittke suffered a stroke that left him in a coma. He was declared clinically dead on several occasions, but recovered and continued to compose. Musik Meile Wien (Walk of Fame Vienna) Gravestone, showing a fermata over a whole rest marked In 1990, Schnittke left the Soviet Union and settled in Hamburg, West Germany. His health remained poor, however. He suffered several more strokes before his death on 3 August 1998, in Hamburg, at the age of 63. He was buried, with state honors, at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, where many other prominent Russian composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, are interred. Music Schnittke's early music shows the strong influence of Dmitri Shostakovich, but after the visit of the Italian composer Luigi Nono to the USSR, he took up the serial technique in works such as Music for Piano and Chamber Orchestra (1964). However, Schnittke soon became dissatisfied with what he termed the \\"puberty rites of serial self-denial.\\" He created a new style which has been called \\"polystylism\\", where he juxtaposed and combined music of various styles past and present. He once wrote, \\"The goal of my life is to unify serious music and light music, even if I break my neck in doing so.\\" His first concert work to use the polystylistic technique was the second violin sonata, Quasi una sonata (1967‚Äì1968). He experimented with techniques in his film work, as shown by much of the sonata appearing first in his score for the 1968 animation short '. He continued to develop the polystylistic technique in works such as the epic First Symphony (1969‚Äì1972) and First Concerto Grosso (1977). Other works were more stylistically unified, such as his piano quintet (1972‚Äì1976), written in memory of his recently deceased mother. In the 1980s, Schnittke's music began to become more widely known abroad, thanks in part to the work of √©migr√© Soviet artists such as the violinists Gidon Kremer and Mark Lubotsky. Despite constant illness, he produced a large amount of music, including important works such as the Second (1980) and Third (1983) String Quartets and the String Trio (1985); the Faust Cantata (1983), which he later incorporated in his opera Historia von D. Johann Fausten; the ballet Peer Gynt (1985‚Äì1987); the Third (1981), Fourth (1984) and Fifth (1988) Symphonies (the last of which is also known as the Fourth Concerto Grosso) and the Viola (1985) and First Cello (1985‚Äì1986) concertos. This period was also marked by a turn in Schnittke and his music to Christian themes, exemplified in his deeply spiritual unaccompanied choral works, the Concerto for Mixed Chorus (1984-1985) and the Penitential Psalms (1988), and alluded to in various others works, including the Fourth Symphony and the Faust Cantata. The Ninth Symphony was first performed on 19 June 1998 in Moscow in a version deciphered ‚Äì but also 'arranged' ‚Äì by Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who conducted the premiere. After hearing a tape of the performance, Schnittke indicated he wanted it withdrawn. After he died, though, others worked to decipher the score. Nikolai Korndorf died before he could complete the task, which was continued and completed by Alexander Raskatov. In Raskatov's version, the three orchestral movements of Schnittke's symphony may be followed by a choral fourth, which is Raskatov's own Nunc Dimittis (in memoriam Alfred Schnittke). This version was premiered in Dresden, Germany, on June 16, 2007. Andrei Boreyko also has a version of the symphony.Alexander Ivashkin, booklet notes to BIS-CD-1727 (2009).

The original airing consisted of a total of ninety-eight episodes and were broadcast from April 3, 1971 to February 10, 1973 on Mainichi Broadcasting System and NET (now TV Asahi). The manga adaptation was also featured in Sh≈çnen Magazine around the same period. The series has evolved into a franchise with many subsequent annual iterations. Story The series takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious worldwide terrorist organization formed by remaining members of the Nazis. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Takeshi battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed superhero Kamen Rider. Another victim of the cyborg process, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, became Kamen Rider Two after Kamen Rider, who eventually renamed himself as \\"Kamen Rider One\\", saved him from Shocker's brainwashing. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against Shocker and its replacement organization, Gelshocker. Manga Many manga based on the original Kamen Rider series have been published, but only one was penned and drawn by Ishinomori himself. Ishinomori was also the author of one chapter of the Kamen Rider Amazon manga and the entire Kamen Rider Black manga. However, those manga were based on sequels to Kamen Rider, rather than the original series. The original manga, published in 1971, initially follows a path resembling the first few episodes of the TV series, from basic plot to creature designs. However, when Takeshi leaves the story, the series diverge greatly. In the TV show, Takeshi travels abroad to fight Shocker in other countries, leaving Japan's protection to Hayato Ichimonji, a freelance cameraman who was experimented on by Shocker but saved by Takeshi, becoming the second Kamen Rider. In the manga, Takeshi never left Japan. He was confronted by twelve \\"Shocker Riders\\" and was subsequently mortally wounded during his battle against them. Hayato Ichimonji, one of the twelve Shocker Riders, receives a head injury during the fight and regains his conscience as a result. He then turns against Shocker and takes Takeshi's role as Kamen Rider. In spite of the damage to his body, Takeshi's brain survives and guides Hayato, the two fighting as one. Takeshi eventually returns as a Rider in both stories, but starting with Hayato's debut, villains and even basic story development greatly diverge between the two versions. The manga portrays a seemingly hopeless battle against Shocker, an organization with ties to governmental conspiracies that seems much bigger than either of the two Riders. The live action TV shows portray the Riders as heroes strong enough to bring down Shocker, only to see it replaced by similar organizations led by Shocker's mysterious leader. The Shocker Riders eventually appear in the TV series, too, but they looked different and had different abilities. There were also only six Shocker Riders, rather than the manga's 12. Characters =Kamen Riders= *: The first main protagonist. A biochemistry lab student at Jonan University who also races motorcycles as part of the Tachibana Racing Club. *: The other main protagonist. A freelance photographer who becomes the second Kamen Rider after Takeshi saves him from Shocker. =Allies= *: Takeshi's racing mentor and confidant. He is often called \\"Pops\\" by other members of his racing club. He runs a small caf√© named Snack Amigo where Takeshi and other members of Tachibana's racing club gather in early episodes, and its employees occasionally assist Takeshi in countering Shocker's plans. At the same time as Takeshi's departure, he opens a motorcycle goods shop named Tachibana Auto Corner and sets up the Tachibana Racing Club. He is often seen smoking a pipe. *: An FBI agent assigned to investigate Shocker activities in Japan. While not himself a cyborg, Kazuya was skilled in martial arts, and often used them alongside both Kamen Riders to battle the combatants who invariably accompanied a Shocker commander. *: Takeshi's teacher in university and an authority on biochemistry. He is a Shocker scientist, but freed Takeshi and was killed by Spider Man, an agent of Shocker. *: The daughter of Doctor Midorikawa, she initially blames Takeshi for her father's death, but eventually learns the truth and becomes his ally.

Its name is an acronym for \\"Sacred Hegemony Of Cycle Kindred Evolutional Realm\\", as revealed in the movie reboot. Shocker's goal is to conquer the world. To this end, their scientists turn humans into superhuman cyborgs by surgically altering them with animal and insect DNA with robotic cybernetics. Virtually all of its members are modified the same way. Even a Shocker Combatant is tougher, faster, and stronger than an ordinary human civilian. The original manga showed that Shocker had influence over the governments of the world. Its founders had ties to the Nazis, Illuminati and the Kamen Rider Spirits manga makes references to the group's support by the Badan Empire. Ruthless and merciless, Shocker would often kidnap prominent scientists and force them to work for the organization, then kill them when their usefulness was at an end, or if they attempted to escape. The decision to kidnap and modify college student Takeshi Hongo proved to be their undoing. He was intended to be another of Shocker's powerful cyborg warriors, a grasshopper-human hybrid, but he escaped and opposed them as Kamen Rider One. A later attempt to create a second, more powerful Kamen Rider backfired when the intended victim, Hayato Ichimonji, was rescued by the original Rider before he was brainwashed. Hayato joined Takeshi as Kamen Rider Two. The pair, known as the Double Riders, put an end to Shocker, and later its remnants, who formed Gelshocker after their disbandment. In OOO, Den-O, All Riders: Let's Go Kamen Riders, Shocker, although with a membership and leadership covering Gelshocker members from the original TV series, obtained a Core Medal and modified it into the Shocker Medal. Though they were originally unable to use it, the appearance of the Greeed Ankh in their time enabled the organization to obtain one of his Cell Medals and create the Shocker Greeed. This altered time so that Shocker defeated the Double Riders and managed to conquer all of Japan and eventually the world, setting up a union with many of the other organizations that originally emerged after Shocker's destruction. The group is ultimately defeated by the Kamen Riders. But as revealed in Kamen Rider OOO onwards, there are some surviving members of the Shocker organization, even from Badan Empire who went into hiding to gather data of the Kamen Riders' battles against some of their respective monsters many years ago. But during the events of Super Hero Taisen GP: Kamen Rider 3, Shocker's remaining scientists created a History Modification Machine that they use to send a time displaced cyborg called Kamen Rider Three back in time to destroy the Double Riders in the aftermath of Gelshocker's defeat, creating a new timeline where Shocker rules the world with some Kamen Riders in their service. Luckily, the apparent destruction of the History Modification Machine restores the timeline (with the exception of Go Shijima/Kamen Rider Mach who was killed by Cheetahkatatsumuri), only to be found out during the events of D-Video Special: Kamen Rider Four that Shocker secretly uses it to create time loops and alters the timeline once more, allowing to create Kamen Rider Four, as well as the revelation that they have been targeting Takumi Inui, due to his sacrifice-less wish to ensure that no one dies like what happened to one of his old allies to create a loop. As Takumi is about to destroy the machine, the Shocker Leader appears with an appearance identical to Takumi's. In the end, Takumi destroys the machine and disappears alongside the modified timeline, restored back to its original timeline once more. Though most of his allies who do not originate from the Kamen Rider 555 TV series like from Kamen Rider Drive, and even Kamen Rider Den-O's Kamen Rider Zeronos don't remember if they had encountered Takumi, only some of Takumi's old friends from the Kamen Rider 555 TV series, including Naoya Kaido still remember Takumi. In the movie Kamen Rider One, there is a civil war between the original Shocker and a newly formed organization called Nova Shocker in an attempt to kidnap Mayu, Tobei Tachibana's granddaughter, and release the Alexander Gamma Eyecon from her body, in order to obtain its power. As all of the revived Ambassador Hell's Shocker fraction had been annihilated completely, leaving only himself, and also after he witnessed how dangerous the Alexander Gamma Eyecon is, he makes an uneasy alliance with Kamen Riders Ghost, Specter and a newly improved Kamen Rider One. * : The high ruler of the organization and main antagonist of the series. He appears for the first time in short video footage shown in episode 34, although his appearance there is mostly hidden by shadows. He talks with his followers through speakers on Shocker's emblems in the multiple outposts. The Shocker Leader is a cruel being who does not have qualms in sacrificing his minions during moments of crisis or failure.Kamen Rider Episode 80 He takes various forms, his first being a cyclopean gorgon in crimson robes in the original series, his second being a skeletal creature in Kamen Rider V3, following a skull-faced insect who leads a mini-restoration of Shocker known as Black Satan, and his true form is known as the in Kamen Rider Stronger a giant humanoid rock man controlled by a large one-eyed cybernetic brain. * (a.k.a. ): From Shocker's Near and Middle East Branch, his true form was a wolflike monster. He was also a disguise specialist, able to mimic Taki's appearance almost perfectly using only makeup during his debut. His personal mark, worn by the Combatants of his own Shocker outpost and used in his official correspondence, was the Shocker emblem, but with the bird's head replaced by a wolf's.Kamen Rider Episode 39 He confronted Kamen Rider Two himself in episode 39 and after a lengthy fight was toppled off a cliff by Kamen Rider Two's Rider Punch, destroying him. Gold Wolf Man briefly appeared in Kamen Rider vs Shocker among the members of the resurrected monster army. In Kamen Rider V3, episode 27, Colonel Zol is resurrected alongside the other three great Shocker and Gelshocker commanders from the original TV series by Destron. He aims to become a Destron commander, replacing Doctor G. However, in episode 28, after Kamen Rider V3 escaped from Destron's base, a self- destruction sequence was activated, and Colonel Zol was unable to escape, dying again with it. In the Kamen Rider Spirits manga, he is revived with other Shocker commanders as a soulless pawn of the Badan Empire. * : From Shocker's branch in Switzerland, he took over Japan's command after Zol's death until Ambassador Hell appeared. However, he returned to Japan in episode 61, working together with Ambassador Hell and also attempting his own plans. He had cold and calculating behavior. In episode 68, he captured Tobei to help train him for his battle with Kamen Rider One, but that only resulted in Tobei learning about his weak point, his head. Discarding his cape when he faced Takeshi for the last time, Death assumed his squidlike monster form to fight Rider One with his tentacle whip, while Taki was held off by the Shocker Combatants. With Tobei's guidance, Kamen Rider One managed to overpower Squidevil and weaken him with a Rider Chop before sending Squidevil falling to his death with his Rider Drill Shoot. Squidevil tried to rise once more, only to fall down and explode. Doctor Death was resurrected by Destron in Kamen Rider V3, episode 27, and speculated about how he had been brought back to replace Doctor G, only to learn that he was there just for a new operation. Shortly afterwards, in episode 28, he died when Destron's base accidentally self-destructed. He is revived as a soulless pawn of the Badan Empire alongside Colonel Zol and Ambassador Hell in the Kamen Rider Spirits manga. * : Summoned from Shocker's branch in Southeast Asia, he took command of the organization in Japan. His true name was according to Kamen Rider Spirits. He used an electromagnetic whip and an iron claw as his weapons. In episode 79, after capturing the Riders' friends, he called Hongo out as he assumed his rattlesnake-like monster form, able to burrow underground and use his whip arm as a weapon. Kamen Rider One battled Rattlander while Kazuya freed Tobei and the others, managing to use his Rider Kick on the monster. Reverting to his normal form, Hell cursed the Riders and screamed to Shocker's perseverance before he died, exploding. Afterwards, the Shocker Leader destroyed the original Shocker. In spite of his failure, Ambassador Hell was resurrected by Destron in Kamen Rider V3, episode 27. In episode 28, his sneaky behavior ended up leading to the prisoner V3 capturing him and escaping from the Destron base. Soon afterwards, Ambassador Hell returned to the base, only to die in its self-destruction. Ambassador Hell returns in the Kamen Rider Spirits manga, working for the Badan Empire. But his difference among the other revived members is that he had his own consciousness, and it is revealed that the Silver Skull used to revive him is capable of bringing back the dead person's memories. In Kamen Rider ZX, Ambassador Darkness, Ambassador Hell's younger cousin, appeared as a Badan Empire leader. * : Black uniformed soldiers, some of the later versions having skeleton markings on their torsos. They are normally easily defeated by the Riders, often without even needing to transform. Their trademark is a high pitched battle-cry. *: A character who only appears in Ishinomori's original Kamen Rider manga. Big Machine is Shocker's highest commander and main antagonist in the manga. He also seems to be the one called \\"Shocker Leader\\" by some of the lower ranking Shocker members. He has a fully mechanized body and is behind Shocker's \\"October Project\\", which involves using a supercomputer to brainwash the population of Japan. He's able to match up the Riders in combat and launch attacks that disrupt electronic equipment, including Rider One's and Two's own bodies. The design of his body was the base of Ambassador Hell's design in the TV show, although it was altered to allow a human face and, unlike Big Machine, Ambassador Hell was kept a separate character from the Shocker Leader. In Kamen Rider √ó Super Sentai: Super Hero Taisen, Big Machine is reimagined as a project of the Shocker/Zangyack Alliance to create a giant robot from the Crisis Fortress and the Gigant Horse. =Gelshocker= was formed after the disbandment of Shocker, with the remnants of the organization absorbing another organization trained in the deserts Africa. After Ambassador Hell's defeat, The Shocker Leader reorganized the organization from the ground up, destroying all remaining secret bases and even killing the remaining troop contingent in a bloody forest massacre witnessed by unfortunate campers. Gelshocker Combatants wore bright purple and yellow costumes, were capable of traveling from one place to another by transforming into sheets that would drop down onto unsuspecting victims, and were capable of taking more blunt abuse than their predecessors. Gelshocker was led by the and , a commander originally from Geldam who had a monstrous leech/chameleon hybrid form called who had the ability to suck blood by hugging humans, which was later used to revive Gelshocker monsters after already being defeated by the Double Riders, throwing leeches which cause the target to follow his orders, and turn himself invisible. Later, he fought the Double Riders on a roller coaster and was defeated by their Rider Double Chop while turned invisible. Weakened, he reverted to his human form and cursed the Double Riders before exploding. Eventually, General Black was resurrected and worked for Destron in an important operation, but ended up dying in the self-destruction of a Destron base. Black returned as a soulless pawn of the Badan Empire in the Kamen Rider Spirits manga, but he was defeated by a Rider Double Kick performed by Kamen Riders 2 and ZX.

The famous \\"henshin sequence\\", in which the title hero performs ritualistic poses and shouting a keyword to transform into his superhero form has since become a staple in Japanese pop-culture, inspiring superheroes and magical girl genres. Kamen Rider went to later produce a great number of spin-offs which remain in production today. Several Kamen Rider series were aired in Japan after the first Kamen Rider finished. After Kamen Rider Black RX ended production in 1989, the series was put on hold. There were three movies released as the 1990s \\"Movie Riders\\", which were Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue, Kamen Rider ZO and Kamen Rider J. After the original creator Sh≈çtar≈ç Ishinomori's death, the Kamen Rider franchise had continued in 2000 with Kamen Rider Kuuga. As of 2020, thirty-one Kamen Rider series have been made, with the newest being Kamen Rider Saber which premiered in September 2020. As of 2005, a remake of the Kamen Rider series was made and reimagined with Kamen Rider The First and continued with Kamen Rider The Next released in 2007. The cultural impact of the series in Japan resulted in astronomer Akimasa Nakamura naming two minor planets in honor of the series: 12408 Fujioka, after actor Hiroshi Fujioka, known for his portrayal of Takeshi Hongo/Kamen Rider 1, and 12796 Kamenrider, after the series itself.

History The Association of the Sons of Poland was established in 1903 as a Fraternal Benefit Society. At the onset of existence the Association's goals were to provide benefits for Polish-American families and send financial help to their relatives in Poland. The Association grew both in membership and financial stability becoming a leader in upholding the traditions of Polish Heritage and patriotism as well as continuing an active contact with Poland. During the first World War while Russia and Germany were systematically destroying Poland, the Delegates to the Quadrennial Convention voted to tax each member 2¬¢ each month to be sent to feed hungry war victims in Poland. In the 1930s, large sums of money were sent to assist flood victims in southern Poland followed by tremendous donations to assist the poor in Polish cities. Just prior to World War Two, the Association was recognized for being the most active organization in the Polish-American Community and was decorated by the Second Republic of Poland with the coveted Z≈Çoty Medal Zas≈Çugi (Gold Medal of Service). The Association continued assisting Poland during her most devastating years of war. Today the Association of the Sons of Poland is the only Polish American Fraternal domiciled in New Jersey. It supports Polish language courses and organizations that promote Polish Culture and Heritage, such as the Polish Singers Alliance of America and an exhibit of art at Seton Hall University. It continues to sponsor the Polish Children‚Äôs Heartline and the Polish Gift of Life, charities that provide medical care for Polish children. The Association was directly involved in the establishment of the Polish-American Congress and Pulaski Memorial Parade Committee, both of which still receive support. Major Foundations like the Kosciuszko Foundation and the Polish Cultural Foundation also receive support. It also gives financial and material support to Polish Orphans, mentally and physically disabled children, the homeless and un-wed mothers both in Poland and the United States through the Sons of Poland Benevolent Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity.  Organization  Local units are referred to as \\"Lodges/Groups\\". Twenty persons who apply for membership may establish their own group however, a minimum of fifty members of the lodge/group is required to send a Delegate to the Convention. The highest national structure is the Supreme Convention, which meets quadrennially. The headquarters of the group is located at 333 Hackensack Street, Carlstadt, New Jersey 07072, while the organization was originally established in Jersey City.  Membership  Membership is through the purchase of life insurance with the minimum amount at $2,000 up to a maximum of $20,000, as a non-medical limit but with an exam, the maximum coverage is $50,000. Benefits of insured membership include a subscription to the monthly Polish American Journal; Scholarships and Achievement awards for High School Seniors; prescription cards that can offer up to a 30% discount on prescription medications for members and even their guests from Poland or any other country; LifeLine Screenings to detect a possible tendency for stroke or aneurisms; group health care discounts that includes a dental/vision plan, and a choice of wellness plans from a health mart and accidental death/dismemberment insurance.

The Diolkos was reportedly used until at least the middle of the 1st century AD, after which no more written references appear. the railroad was built in 1936. 16th-18th century * Mid 16th century (1550) ‚Äì Hand propelled mining tubs known as \\"hands\\" were used in the provinces surrounding/forming modern day Germany by the mid-16th century having been improved use since the mid-15th century. This technology was brought to England by German miners working in the Minerals Royal at various sites in the English Lake District near Keswick (now in Cumbria).Michael Lewis and Jonathan Taunton, Early wooden railways (A.M. Kelley, 1970). * c.1594 ‚Äì The first overground railway line in England may have been a wooden-railed, horse-drawn tramroad which was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, around 1600 and possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away. * c.1600 ‚Äì A funicular railway was made at Broseley in Shropshire some time before 1605 to carry coal for James Clifford from his mines down to the river Severn to be loaded onto barges and carried to riverside towns.Peter King, The First Shropshire Railways in G. Boyes (ed.), Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008 (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), pp. 70‚Äì84. * 1604 ‚Äì Huntingdon Beaumont, partner of landowner Sir Percival Willoughby, built the Wollaton Wagonway, running from mines at Strelley to Wollaton in Nottinghamshire. It was approximately two miles in length. Beaumont built three further wagonways shortly afterwards near Blyth, Northumberland, to service the coal and salt trades. * 1722 ‚Äì The Tranent ‚Äì Cockenzie Waggonway was built by the York Buildings Company of London, to transport coal from the Tranent pits to the salt pans at Cockenzie and the Harbour at Port Seton, in Haddingtonshire, now East Lothian. This wooden waggonway was replaced in 1815 with an iron fish bellied edgeway to Cockenzie Harbour by the new owners, the Cadell family. This was Scotland's first railway of any kind, with one section of it remaining in constant use until 1962. Some in situ stone sleeper blocks survive at the Robert Stevenson designed Cockenzie Harbour, and the entirety of the route is a way marked footpath. * 1725 ‚Äì The Tanfield Wagonway was constructed to lead coal from pits around Tanfield to the Tyne at Redheugh (Gateshead). It was the first railway built on a large scale - 5 miles of double wooden track with massive civil engineering works including deep cuttings, huge embankments and the world's first large masonry railway bridge, the Causey Arch. Each 2.5 ton capacity waggon (with flanged wooden wheels) was hauled by a horse, up to 60 waggons per hour at peak times. Two miles of the wagonway route are still in use by the Tanfield Railway, making this the oldest operational railway in the world. * 1758 ‚Äì The Middleton Railway, the first railway granted powers by Act of Parliament, carried coal cheaply from the Middleton pits to Leeds. The line was privately financed and operated, initially as a wagonway using horse-drawn wagons. Around 1799, Middleton began to replace wooden tracks with iron edge rails at a gauge of 4 ft 1 in (1,245 mm). In 1812 the Middleton Railway became the first commercial railway to successfully use steam locomotives: the Salamanca of John Blenkinsop. *1760s - Iron production in Britain begin to rise dramatically, followed by a similar rise on the European continent. Causes were the use of coke for smelting and refining pig iron and cast iron and the application of the steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder to providing pressurized air for blast furnaces. * 1768 ‚Äì The Wagon Way was constructed by the Erskines of Mar in Alloa, to carry coal from the Clackmannanshire coalfields of central Scotland to the Port of Alloa. Initially using wooden rails, these were later clad in Swedish iron (1785), and carried horse-drawn wagons. Some of the Wagon Way route still exists, although the tracks are long gone.http://www.britainfromabove.org.uk/image/spw020247 * 1783 ‚Äì Henry Cort patented the grooved rolling mill for rolling hot iron to expel molten slag. Rolling was 15 times faster than hammering. * 1783 ‚Äì Henry Cort patented the puddling process for making wrought iron. This was the first large scale process for making a structural grade of iron and was also much less expensive than previous methods. Puddled iron production came into widespread production after 1800. * 1784 ‚Äì William Murdock demonstrated a steam carriage powered by a high pressure engine. He would later show it to his neighbor Richard Trevithick who would go on to build locomotives. * 1789 ‚Äì The Charnwood Forest Canal, sometimes known as the \\"Forest Line of the Leicester Navigation\\" has a railways to supplement the canal between Nanpantan and Loughborough, Leicestershire. William Jessop had realised a horse-drawn railway for coal wagons. He used successfully an iron edge-rail, in contrast to his partner Benjamin Outram, who, for other such lines, preferred the traditional iron \\"L\\" shaped flange-rail plateway. * 1793 ‚Äì the Butterley Gangroad or the \\"Crich Rail-way\\" was built by Benjamin Outram, to connect the Warner limestone Quarry to the Cromford Canal a mile away at Bullbridge. Contains the oldest known Railway tunnel at Fritchley * 1798 ‚Äì the Lake Lock Rail Road, arguably the world's first public railway, opened in 1798 to carry coal from the Outwood area to the Aire and Calder navigation at Lake Lock near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on a distance of approximately 3 miles. The load of three wagons was hauled by one horse. The track used edge rails to a gauge of 3 ft 4 3/4 in (1,035 mm.). The line gradually declined and was closed in 1836. 1800 to 1850 * 1800 The Boulton and Watt steam engine patent expired, allowing others to build high pressure engines with high power to weight ratios, suitable for locomotives.James Watt: Monopolist *1802 - The Carmarthenshire Tramroad, horse-drawn goods line, located in south west Wales, was established by the Act of Parliament. This line was used for coal transportation. It was a plateway of about 4 foot gauge, and powered with a pair of horses. *1802 - Unable to construct a canal like the nearby Cyfarthfa Ironworks, three of the four principal ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil, Wales : Dowlais, Plymouth and Penydarren collaborated in building the 9.5 mile Merthyr Tramroad between Merthyr Tydfil and Abercynon. It was a single track plateway with a gauge of 4 ft 4 in over the flanges of the L shaped cast iron plate rails. The plates were 3 ft long. One horse pulled about five trams. *1803 - The Surrey Iron Railway, London. It linked the towns of Wandsworth and Croydon via Mitcham on the south of the Thames. It was double track plateway throughout with a spacing of about 5 feet. The rails were of the Outram pattern are L-shaped in cross-section and 3 feet 2 inches long. The line was closed in 1846. A part of the route is now used by Tramlink between Wimbledon and West Croydon. *1804 - First steam locomotive railway known as Penydarren or \\"Pen-y-Darren\\" locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick, used to haul iron from Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon, Wales. The first train carried a load of 10 tons of iron. On one occasion it successfully tried hauling 25 tons. However, the weight of the locomotive was about 5 tons and broke many of the cast iron plate rails. *1805 - The Croydon Merstham & Godstone goods railway opens; first commercial railway, connected to the Surrey Iron Railway *1807 - First fare-paying, horse-drawn passenger railway service in the world was established on the Oystermouth Railway in Swansea, Wales. Later this became known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway although the railway was more affectionately known as \\"The Mumbles Train\\" (). The railway was laid in the form of a plateway, with the rails being approximately 4 ft (1,219 mm). *1808 - The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was the first railway in Scotland authorised by Act of Parliament. It was a plateway, using L-shaped iron plates as rails. In 1817 It was also the first in Scotland to trial a steam locomotive. It was the Bl√ºcher from George Stephenson used at Killingworth Colliery. This locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4 mph (6.4 km/h). It was used to tow coal wagons along the wagonway from Killingworth to Wallsend. It was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast iron rails. *1808 - Richard Trevithick sets up a \\"steam circus\\" (a circular steam railway with locomotive Catch Me Who Can) in London for some months, for the public to experience for 1 shilling each. *1809 Thomas Leiper constructed a 60 ft long test railway in Philadelphia to show that 1 horse could haul 10 times more weight on a railed road than on an earthen road. Railway constructed of stone sleepers and wood rails. *1810 Thomas Leiper constructed a 3/4 mile long railroad to transport gneiss from his quarry in Avondale PA to Ridley Creek. *1812 - First commercial use of a steam locomotive on the Middleton Railway, Leeds. Matthew Murray of Fenton, Murray and Wood, in Holbeck, designed a locomotive with a pinion that meshed with a rack. Murray's design was based on Richard Trevithick's locomotive, Catch me who can, adapted to use Blenkinsop's rack and pinion system, and probably was called Salamanca. It was the first two-cylinder locomotive. *1813 - Wylam Waggonway for goods, to haul coal chaldron wagons from the mine at Wylam to the docks at Lemington-on-Tyne in Northumberland : steam locomotive Puffing Billy started commercial operation. Designer William Hedley, blacksmith Timothy Hackworth. Ran for 50 years hauling coal. Wylam is the birthplace of George Stephenson. *1814 - George Stephenson constructs his first locomotive, Bl√ºcher for the Killingworth wagonway. The locomotive was modelled on Matthew Murray's. It could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4 mph (6.4 km/h) but was too heavy to run on wooden rails or iron rails which existed in that time. *1822 - Stephenson's Hetton colliery railway for goods, is the first purpose built railway not to use animal power, instead using stationery engines, inclines and purpose built steam locomotives. *1825 - Stephenson's Stockton and Darlington Railway, for goods, the first publicly subscribed, adhesion worked railway using steam locomotives, carrying freight from a Colliery to a river port. The line opened on 26 September 1825. The following day, 550 passengers were hauled, making this the world's first steam-powered passenger railway, contrary to the claims of Liverpool five years later. *1825 John Stevens of Hoboken NJ built a 1/2 mile circular test railroad track and also built a steam locomotive, the first in America. The locomotive had a pinion and the track had a rack. *1826 January - the first section of the Springwell Colliery Railway, latter to become known as the Bowes Railway opened, this was the first six miles of what would become a 15-mile railway, using a mix of locomotive and rope (cable) haulage. Part of the original line is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. *1827 June 30 - The first railway opened in France between Saint-Etienne and Andr√©zieux (horse- drawn carriage). Some tests had been run since 1 May 1827. The official opening ceremony on 1 October 1828 never really took place, this date being in fact the first fiscal year of the railway company. *1827 January to May - Construction of the Mauch Chunk Gravity Railroad to transport anthorcite from mines to Lehigh River in Pennsylvania. *1828 - 1 August, opening of the Bolton and Leigh Railway with locomotive ‚ÄúLancashire Witch‚Äù pulling wagons loaded with approximately 150 passengers..

Engineered by George Stephenson, a 5¬æ mile line running from Canterbury to the small port and fishing town of Whitstable, approximately 55 miles east of London. Traction was provided by three Stationary Winding Engines, and \\"Invicta\\"; Invicta was an 0-4-0 Loco, built by the Stephenson company, but only operated on a level section of track because she produced a meagre 9 hp. *1830 - The first public railway in the United States, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;), opened with 23 miles of track, with mostly hardwood rail topped with iron. The steam locomotive, Tom Thumb (locomotive), was designed and built by Peter Cooper for the B&O; ‚Äî the first American-built steam locomotive. Trials of the locomotive began on the B&O; that year. *1830 - The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened, and the first steam passenger service, primarily locomotive-hauled and entirely exclusive of animal power, began. The line had the first timetables for passengers and proper stations (with ticketing office and platforms) and proved the viability of rail transport. Large scale railway construction started in Britain, then spread throughout the world, beginning the Railway Age. *1830 - The first portion of the Saint-√âtienne‚ÄìLyon railway opened between Givors and Rive-de- Gier on 1 July 1830. The rest of the line opened on 1 October 1832 for passenger use only, accepting freight a few months later. It used iron rails on dice stones. The line was 58 km long and had a 375 meters elevation with 112 bridges and three tunnels. The locomotives were based on George Stephenson Locomotion, but with a tubular boiler that produced six times more power. *1831 - First railway in Australia, for the Australian Agricultural Company, a cast iron fishbelly gravitational railway servicing the A Pit coal mine. *1831 - First passenger season tickets issued on the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. *1832 - The Leicester and Swannington Railway opened in Leicestershire - the first steam railway in the English Midlands. *1832 - Railway switch patented by Charles Fox. *1833 - The Great Western Railway Works, near Swindon, England are founded by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. *1834 - The first section of the Boston and Albany Railroad opens, subsequently becoming part of the New York Central Railroad. *1834 - Ireland's first railway, the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR;) opened between Dublin and Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire), a distance of six miles. *1835 - In Belgium, a railway opened on 5 May between Brussels and Mechelen : The line 25.

Self-educated, he rose to become a successful copywriter and business owner in Cleveland and Elyria, Ohio. In 1912, Anderson had a nervous breakdown that led him to abandon his business and family to become a writer. At the time, he moved to Chicago and was eventually married three additional times. His most enduring work is the short-story sequence Winesburg, Ohio,Anderson, Sherwood (1876‚Äì1941)  St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Summary which launched his career. Throughout the 1920s, Anderson published several short story collections, novels, memoirs, books of essays, and a book of poetry. Though his books sold reasonably well, Dark Laughter (1925), a novel inspired by Anderson's time in New Orleans during the 1920s, was his only bestseller. Early life Sherwood Berton Anderson was born on September 13, 1876, in Camden, Ohio, a farming town with a population of around 650 (according to the 1870 census).Rideout (2006), 16 He was the third of seven children born to Emma Jane (n√©e Smith) and former Union soldier and harness-maker Irwin McLain Anderson. Considered reasonably well-off financially, Anderson's father was seen as an up-and-comer by his Camden contemporaries, the family left town just before Sherwood's first birthday. Reasons for the departure are uncertain; most biographers note rumors of debts incurred by either IrwinSchevill (1951), 8Howe (1951), 12 or his brother Benjamin. The Andersons headed north to Caledonia by way of a brief stay in a village of a few hundred called Independence (now Butler). FourTownsend (1987), 3 or fiveRideout (2006), 18 years were spent in Caledonia, years which formed Anderson's earliest memories. This period later inspired his semi-autobiographical novel Tar: A Midwest Childhood (1926).Rideout (2006), 20. For connection between Tar and Caledonia, also see Anderson (1942), 14-16 In Caledonia Anderson's father began drinking excessively, which led to financial difficulties, eventually causing the family to leave the town. With each move, Irwin Anderson's prospects dimmed; while in Camden he was the proprietor of a successful shop and could employ an assistant, but by the time the Andersons finally settled down in Clyde, Ohio in 1884, Irwin could only get work as a hired man to harness manufacturers.Townsend (1987), 4 That job was short-lived, and for the rest of Sherwood Anderson's childhood, his father barely supported the family as an occasional sign-painter and paperhanger, while his mother took in washing to make ends meet.Howe (1951), 13-14 Partly as a result of these misfortunes, young Sherwood became adept at finding various odd jobs to help his family, earning the nickname \\"Jobby.\\"Rideout (2006), 34Townsend (1987), 14. The chapter about Anderson's early life is called \\"Jobby.\\" Though he was a decent student, Anderson's attendance at school declined as he began picking up work, and he finally left school for good at age 14 after about nine months of high school.Howe (1951), 16Rideout (2006), 39 From the time he began to cut school to the time he left town, Anderson worked as a \\"...newsboy, errand boy, waterboy, cow-driver, stable groom, and perhaps printer's devil, not to mention assistant to Irwin Anderson, Sign Painter...\\" in addition to assembling bicycles for the Elmore Manufacturing Company.Townsend (1987), 25-26 Even in his teens, Anderson's talent for selling was evident, a talent he would later draw on in a successful career in advertising. As a newsboy he was said to have convinced a tired farmer in a saloon to buy two copies of the same evening paper. With the exception of work, Anderson's childhood resembled that of other boys his age. In addition to participating in local events and spending time with his friends, Anderson was a voracious reader. Though there were only a few books in the Anderson home (The Pilgrim's Progress and the Complete Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson among them), the youth read widely by borrowing from the school library (there was not a public library in Clyde until 1903), and the personal libraries of a school superintendent and John Tichenor, a local artist, who responded to Anderson's interest.Rideout (2006), 37-38. See Anderson (1924), 155-56 for list of authors enjoyed by young Anderson By Anderson's 18th year in 1895, his family was on shaky ground. His father had started to disappear for weeks.Townsend (1987), 11 Two years earlier, in 1893, Karl, Sherwood's elder brother, had left Clyde for Chicago.Spanierman Gallery, LLC. KARL ANDERSON (1874 - 1956) . Accessed 26 May 2013. On May 10, 1895, his mother succumbed to tuberculosis. Sherwood, now essentially on his own, boarded at the Harvey & Yetter's livery stable where he worked as a groom‚Äîan experience that would translate into several of his best-known stories.Townsend (1987), 28Rideout (2006), 59-61 (Irwin Anderson died in 1919 after having been estranged from his son for two decades.)Townsend (1987), 30 Two months before his mother's death, in March 1895, Anderson had signed up with the Ohio National Guard for a five-year hitchRideout (2006), 50 while he was going steady with Bertha Baynes, an attractive girl and possibly the inspiration for Helen White in Winesburg, Ohio,Rideout (2006), 47 and he was working a secure job at the bicycle factory. But his mother's death precipitated the young man's leaving Clyde. He settled in Chicago around late 1896Townsend (1987), 31Howe (1951), 27 or spring/summer 1897, having worked a few small-town factory jobs along the way.Rideout (2006), 69-71 Chicago and war Anderson moved to a boardinghouse in Chicago owned by a former mayor of Clyde. His brother Karl lived in the city and was studying at the Art Institute. Anderson moved in with him and quickly found a job at a cold-storage plant.Townsend (1987), 33 In late 1897, Karl moved away, and Anderson relocated to a two-room flat with his sister and two younger brothers newly come from Clyde.Townsend (1987), 34 Money was tight‚ÄîAnderson earned \\"two dollars for a day of ten hours\\"‚ÄîAnderson (1942), 112 but with occasional support from Karl, they got by. Following the example of his Clyde confederate and lifelong friend Cliff Paden (later to become known as John Emerson) and Karl, Anderson took up the idea of furthering his education by enrolling in night school at the Lewis Institute.Rideout (2006), 73‚Äì74 He attended several classes regularly including \\"New Business Arithmetic\\" earning marks that placed him second in the class.Townsend (1987), 36 It was also there that Anderson heard lectures on Robert Browning, Alfred Tennyson, and was possibly first introduced to the poetry of Walt Whitman. Soon, however, Anderson's first stint in Chicago would come to an end as the United States prepared to enter the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Although he had limited resources while in Chicago, Anderson bought a new suit and returned to Clyde to join the military.Townsend (1987), 38 Once home, the company he joined mustered into the army at Camp Bushnell, Ohio on May 12, 1898.Rideout (2006), 78 Several months of training followed at various southern encampments until early in 1899, when his company was sent to Cuba. Fighting had ceased four months prior to their arrival. On April 21, 1899, they left Cuba having seen no combat.Townsend (1987), 39‚Äì41 According to Irving Howe, \\"Sherwood was popular among his army comrades, who remembered him as a fellow given to prolonged reading, mostly in dime westerns and historical romances, and talented at finding a girl when he wanted one. For the first of these traits he was frequently teased, but the second brought him the respect it usually does in armies.\\"Howe (1951), 29 After the war, Anderson resided briefly in Clyde performing agricultural work before deciding to return to school.Townsend (1987), 41 In September 1899 Anderson joined his siblings Karl and Stella in Springfield, Ohio where, at the age of twenty-three he enrolled for his senior year of preparatory school at the Wittenberg Academy, a preparatory school located on the campus of the Wittenberg University. In his time there he performed well, earning good marks and participating in several extracurricular activities. In the spring of 1900 Anderson graduated from the Academy, offering a discourse on Zionism as one of the eight students chosen to give a commencement speech.Howe (1951), 31‚Äì32 Business, marriage and family During his time in Springfield, Anderson stayed and worked as a \\"chore boy\\" in a boardinghouse called The Oaks among a group of businessmen, educators, and other creatives types many of whom became friendly with the young Anderson. In particular, a high school teacher named Trillena White and a businessman Harry Simmons played a role in the author's life. The former who was ten years Anderson's senior would walk‚Äîraising eyebrows among the other boarders‚Äîwith the young man in the evenings. More importantly, according to Anderson, she \\"first introduced me to fine literature\\"Anderson (1984), 227‚Äì228 and would later serve as inspiration for a number of his characters including the teacher Kate Swift in Winesburg, Ohio.Townsend (1987), 42‚Äì43Rideout (2006), 226 The latter, who worked as the advertising manager for Mast, Crowell, and Kirkpatrick (later Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, publishers of the Woman's Home Companion) and occasionally took meals at The Oaks, was so impressed by Anderson's commencement speech that he offered him a job on the spot as an advertising solicitor at his company's Chicago office. Thus, in the summer of 1900, Anderson returned to Chicago where most of his siblings were now living, intent on achieving success in his new white-collar occupation.Rideout (2006), 92‚Äì93 Though he performed well, problems with his boss and a dislike for the office routine and for the style of correspondence, which caused the ultimate rift, caused Anderson to leave Crowell in mid-1901 for a position set up for him by Marco Marrow, another friend from The Oaks, at the Frank B. White Advertising Company (later the Long-Critchfield Agency).Daugherty (1948), 31 There the author stayed until 1906, selling ads and writing advertising copy for manufacturers of farming implements and articles for the trade journal, Agricultural Advertising.See Rideout (2006), 95‚Äì110 & Anderson (1989) for analysis and the collected early work, respectively In this latter magazine Anderson published his first professional work, a February 1902 piece called \\"The Farmer Wears Clothes.\\"Rideout (2006), 95 What followed were approximately 29 articles and essays for his company's magazine, and two for a small literary magazine published by the Bobbs-Merrill Company called The Reader.Campbell, Hilbert H (Summer 1998). \\"The Early non- Journal Writings\\". The Sherwood Anderson Review 23 (2). According to scholar Welford Dunaway Taylor, the two monthly columns (\\"Rot and Reason\\" and \\"Business Types\\") Anderson wrote for Agricultural Advertising exemplified the \\"character writing\\" (or character sketches) that would later become a notable part of the author's approach in Winesburg, Ohio and other works.Taylor, Welford Dunaway (Winter 1998). \\"Remembered \\"Characters\\" in Winesburg, Ohio\\". The Winesburg Eagle 23 (1). \\"Roof-Fix carried us to Elyria\\" wrote Sherwood Anderson's wife, Cornelia Lane, of the product her husband started a company to sell.Rideout(2006), 133 Advertisement for the Anderson Manufacturing Co., a company owned by Sherwood Anderson from 1907‚Äì1913, almost a decade before he became a well-known author Part of Anderson's job in those early years of his career was making trips to solicit potential clients. On one of these trips around May 1903 he stopped in the home of a friend from Clyde, Jane \\"Jennie\\" Bemis, then living in Toledo, Ohio. It was there that he met Cornelia Pratt Lane (1877‚Äì1967), the daughter of wealthy Ohio businessman Robert Lane. The two were married a year later, on the 16th of May, in Lucas, Ohio.Ohio, County Marriages, 1774-1993 They would go on to have three children‚ÄîRobert Lane (1907‚Äì1951), John Sherwood (1908‚Äì1995), and Marion (aka Mimi, 1911‚Äì1996).Rideout (2006), 112‚Äì114 After a short honeymoon, the couple moved into an apartment on the south side of Chicago.A copy of Sherwood Anderson's honeymoon journal is available in the Sherwood Anderson Review (Summer 1998) For two additional years, Anderson worked for Long-Critchfield until an opportunity came along from one of the accounts he managed and so on Labor Day 1906, Sherwood Anderson left Chicago for Cleveland to become president of United Factories Company, a mail-order firm selling various items from surrounding firms.Rideout (2006), 122‚Äì123 While his new job, which amounted to the position of sales manager, could be stressfulTownsend (1987), 59‚Äì60 the happy home life Cornelia had fostered in Chicago continued in Cleveland; \\"his wife and he entertained frequently. They went to church on Sundays, with Anderson decked out in morning clothes and top hat. On occasional Sunday afternoons Cornelia taught him French. She also helped with his advertising work.\\"Schevill (1951), 45 Unfortunately, his home life could not sustain him when one of the manufacturers United Factories marketed produced a large batch of defective incubators. Soon, letters addressed to Anderson (who personally guaranteed all products sold) began to arrive from customers both desperate and angry. The strain from months of answering hundreds of these letters while continuing his demanding schedule at work and home led to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1907 and eventually his departure from the company.Rideout (2006), 126‚Äì128 His failure in Cleveland did not delay him for long, however, because in September 1907, the Andersons moved to Elyria, Ohio, a town of approximately ten thousand residents, where he rented a warehouse within sight of the railroad and began a mail-order business selling (at a markup of 500%) a preservative paint called \\"Roof-Fix.\\"Daugherty (1948), 33 The first years in Elyria went very well for Anderson and his family; two more children were added for a total of three in addition to a busy social life for their parents.Howe (1951), 41‚Äì42 So well, in fact, did the Anderson Manufacturing Co. do that Anderson was able to purchase and absorb several similar businesses and expand his firm's product-lines under the name Anderson Paint Company.Rideout (2006), 134 Carrying on that momentum, in late 1911 Anderson secured the financial backing to merge his companies into the American Merchants Company, a profit-sharing/investment firm operating in part on a scheme he developed around that time called \\"Commercial Democracy.\\"Rideout (2006), 137‚Äì138Sutton (1967), 9‚Äì12 Nervous breakdown It was then, at what seemed the pinnacle of his business achievements, when the stresses of Anderson's professional life collided with his social responsibilities and his writing, that Anderson suffered the breakdown that has remained paramount in the \\"myth\\"Schevill (1951), 55 or \\"legend\\"Howe (1951), 49White (1972), xii‚Äìxiv of Sherwood Anderson's life.Rideout (2006), 149‚Äì155 On Thursday, November 28, 1912, Anderson came to his office in a slightly nervous state. According to his secretary, he opened some mail, and in the course of dictating a business letter became distracted. After writing a note to his wife, he murmured something along the lines of \\"I feel as though my feet were wet, and they keep getting wetter.\\"The quote above comes from the Frances Shute, Anderson's secretary at the time, as cited in Rideout (2006), 155. In Anderson (1924), it was remembered as \\"I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet. My feet are cold, wet and heavy from long wading in a river. Now I shall go walk on dry land,\\" whereas in Anderson (1942), it was \\"My feet are cold and wet. I have been walking too long on the bed of a river.\\" and left the office. Four days later, on Sunday December 1, a disoriented Anderson entered a drug store on East 152nd Street in Cleveland and asked the pharmacist to help figure out his identity. Unable to make out what the incoherent Anderson was saying, the pharmacist discovered a phone book on his person and called the number of Edwin Baxter, a member of the Elyria Chamber of Commerce. Baxter came, recognized Anderson, and promptly had him checked into the Huron Road Hospital in downtown Cleveland, where Anderson's wife, who he would hardly recognize, went to meet him.Most Anderson's biographers agree on the events included here. For a general sense, see Rideout (2006), 155‚Äì156; Schevill (1951), 52‚Äì59; Townsend (1987), 76‚Äì82. But even before returning home, Anderson began his lifelong practice of reinterpreting the story of his breakdown. Despite news reports in the Elyria Evening Telegram and the Cleveland Press following his admittance into the hospital that ascribed the cause of the breakdown to \\"overwork\\" and that mentioned Anderson's inability to remember what happened,See issues of December 2nd and 3rd for the former and December 3rd for the latter on December 6 the story changed. All of a sudden, the breakdown became voluntary. The Evening Telegram reported (possibly spuriously)Sutton (1967), 43‚Äì44 that \\"As soon as he recovers from the trance into which he placed himself, Sherwood Anderson ... will write a book of the sensations he experienced while he wandered over the country as a nomad.\\"Elyria Evening Telegram(06 December 1912) as quoted in Schevill (1951), 59 This same sense of personal agency is alluded to thirty years later in Sherwood Anderson's Memoirs (1942) where the author wrote of his thought process before walking out: \\"I wanted to leave, get away from business. ... Again I resorted to slickness, to craftiness...The thought occurred to me that if men thought me a little insane they would forgive me if I lit out....\\"Anderson (1942), 194 This idea, however, that Anderson made a conscious decision on November 28 to make a clean break from family and business is unlikely.Sutton (1967), 12Rideout (2006), 157 In the first place, contrary to what Anderson later claimed, his writing was no secret. It was known to his wife, secretary, and some business associates that for several years Anderson had been working on personal writing projects both at night and occasionally in his office at the factory. Secondly, although some of the notes he wrote were to himself during his journey, notes he mailed to his wife on Saturday, addressing the envelope \\"Cornelia L. Anderson, Pres., American Striving Co.,\\" show that he had some semblance of memory. The general confusion and frequent incoherence the notes exhibit is unlikely to be deliberate.Sutton (1967), 36‚Äì39 offers the complete text of the notes with analysis, and several other biographers including Townsend (1987) and Rideout (2006) analyze and print selections. While diagnoses for the four days of Anderson's wanderings have ranged from \\"amnesia\\" to \\"lost identity\\" to \\"nervous breakdown,\\" his condition is generally characterized today as a \\"fugue state.\\"Townsend (1987), 81Sperber, Michael (05 June 2013). \\"[Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Fugue) and a Literary Masterpiece http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychogenic-fugue- literature]\\" Psychiatric Times.

In 1920, he published Poor White, which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published Many Marriages; in it he explored the new sexual freedom, a theme which he continued in Dark Laughter and later writing. Dark Laughter had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. F. Scott Fitzgerald considered Many Marriages to be Anderson's finest novel.Howe, Irving. Sherwood Anderson. New York: William Sloane Associates, 1951. (pg. 254) Beginning in 1924, Sherwood and Elizabeth Prall Anderson moved to New Orleans, where they lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining Jackson Square in the heart of the French Quarter. For a time, they entertained William Faulkner, Carl Sandburg, Edmund Wilson and other writers, for whom Anderson was a major influence. Critics trying to define Anderson's significance have said he was more influential through this younger generation than through his own works. Anderson referred to meeting Faulkner in his ambiguous and moving short story, \\"A Meeting South.\\" His novel Dark Laughter (1925) drew from his New Orleans experiences and continued to explore the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Although the book was satirized by Ernest Hemingway in his novella The Torrents of Spring, it was a bestseller at the time, the only book of Anderson's to reach that status during his lifetime. Four marriages Anderson and Cornelia Lane married in 1904 and divorced in 1916 after having his only 3 children. Anderson quickly married Tennessee Claflin Mitchell in 1916 and obtained a divorce Reno, Nevada in 1924. That year Anderson married Elizabeth Norma Prall (1884‚Äì1976), a friend of Faulkner's whom he had met in New York. After several years that marriage also failed. In 1928 Anderson became involved with Eleanor Gladys Copenhaver (1896‚Äì1985). In 1933, Anderson and Copenhaver married.Anderson (1991), pp. 8‚Äì9 They traveled and often studied together. They were both active in the trade union movement.Documenting the American South: Oral Histories of the American South, University of North Carolina Anderson also became close to Copenhaver's mother, Laura. Later work Anderson frequently contributed articles to newspapers. In 1935, he was commissioned to go to Franklin County, Virginia to cover a major federal trial of bootleggers and gangsters, in what was called \\"The Great Moonshine Conspiracy\\". More than 30 men had been indicted for trial. In his article, he said Franklin was the \\"wettest county in the world,\\" a phrase used as a title for a 21st-century novel by Matt Bondurant. In the 1930s, Anderson published Death in the Woods (short stories), Puzzled America (essays), and Kit Brandon: A Portrait (novel). In 1932, Anderson dedicated his novel Beyond Desire to Copenhaver. Although by this time he was considered to be less influential overall in American literature, some of what have become his most quoted passages were published in these later works. The books were otherwise considered inferior to his earlier ones. Beyond Desire built on his interest in the trade union movement and was set during the 1929 Loray Mill Strike in Gastonia, North Carolina. Hemingway referred to it satirically in his novel, To Have and Have Not (1937), where he included as a minor character an author working on a novel of Gastonia. In his later years, Anderson and Copenhaver lived on his Ripshin Farm in Troutdale, Virginia, which he purchased in 1927 for use during summers. While living there, he contributed to a country newspaper, columns that were collected and published posthumously.Return to Winesburg: Selections from Four Years of Writing for a Country Newspaper, edited by Ray Lewis White (1967) Death Anderson's grave marker at Round Hill Cemetery in Marion, Virginia.

These two teams of young soccer (football) players line up and high-five after a game to practice good sportsmanship. Sportsmanship is an aspiration or ethos that a sport or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. This is with proper consideration for fairness, ethics, respect, and a sense of fellowship with one's competitors. A \\"sore loser\\" refers to one who does not take defeat well, whereas a \\"good sport\\" means being a \\"good winner\\" as well as being a \\"good loser\\"See, e.g., Joel Fish and Susan Magee, 101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent, p. 168. Fireside, 2003.David Lacey, \\"It takes a bad loser to become a good winner.\\" The Guardian, November 10, 2007. (someone who shows courtesy towards another in a sports game).  Analysis  Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sports situations. Sportsmanship mainly refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence,Shields & Bredemeier, 1995. and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly, maintaining self-control if dealing with others, and respect for both authority and opponents. Sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one reacts to a sport/game/player. The four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form, the will to win, equity and fairness. All four elements are critical and a balance must be found among all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated. These elements may also cause conflict, as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship. This will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman, but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsmanlike. When athletes become too self-centred, the idea of sportsmanship is dismissed. Today's sporting culture, in particular the base of elite sport, places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result. In most, if not all sports, sportsmen at the elite level make the standards on sportsmanship and no matter whether they like it or not, they are seen as leaders and role models in society. Since every sport is rule driven, the most common offence of bad sportsmanship is the act of cheating or breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage this is called unsportsmanlike conduct. A competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after losing a game or contest is often called a \\"sore loser\\", while a competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after winning is typically called a \\"bad winner\\". Sore loser behavior includes blaming others for the loss, not accepting responsibility for personal actions that contributed to the defeat, reacting to the loss in an immature or improper fashion, making excuses for the defeat, and citing unfavorable conditions or other petty issues as reasons for the defeat.\\"MJD\\", \\"If he's going to lose, Bill Belichick would rather be elsewhere\\". Yahoo Sports, February 3, 2008.E-releases, \\"Super Winners and Losers\\" (\\"The Patriots' coach was eviscerated by sports pundits for leaving the field before the game was actually finished.\\") A bad winner acts in a shallow fashion after his or her victory, such as by gloating about his or her win, rubbing the win in the face(s) of the opponent(s), and lowering the opponent(s)'s self-esteem by constantly reminding the opponent(s) of \\"poor\\" performance in comparison (even if the opponent(s) competed well). Not showing respect to the other team is considered to being a bad sportsman and could lead to demoralising effects; as Leslie Howe describes: \\"If a pitcher in baseball decides to pitch not to his maximum ability suggest that the batter is not at an adequate level, [it] could lead to the batter to have low self-confidence or worth.\\" There are six different categories relating to sportsmanship: the elements of sports, the elements of sportsmanship, clarifications, conflicts, balance and irreducibility. All six of these characterize a person with good sportsmanship. Even though there is some affinity between some of the categories, they are distinct elements. \\"In essence, play has for its directed and immediate end joy, pleasure, and delights and which is dominated by a spirit of moderation and generosity. Athletics, on the other hand, is essentially a competitive activity, which has for its end victory in the contest and which is characterized of dedication, sacrifice and intensity.\\" (Feelezz, 1896, pp. 3) Hence, the virtues of a player are radically different from the virtues of an athlete. (Feelezz, 1896, pp. 3). When talking about misunderstanding sportsmanship, Rudd and Stoll (2013) provide an example from 1995, a U.S. high school athletic league banned the post-game handshake that was a part of sports such as football and basketball. The handshaking was banned because of fights that were ensuing after the handshake.(pp. 41) Most players are influenced by the leaders around them such as coaches and older players, if there are coaches and administrators who don't understand sportsmanship, then what about the players?  Examples  A moment of sportmanship when John Landy helped Ron Clarke get up after he had fallen. There are various ways that sportsmanship is practiced in different sports. Being a good sport often includes treating others as you would also like to be treated, cheer for good plays (even if it is made by the opposition), accept responsibility for your mistakes, and keep your perspective. An example of treating others how you would like to be treated would include being respectful and polite to other team members and the opposition because in return you would also like to be treated the same way. Cheer for good plays could include if in netball a player of the opposition made a good lead for the ball, which then resulted in a goal, everyone would either clap or make a supportive comment to acknowledge that what the player did was very well done. To accept responsibility for your mistakes will entail not placing the blame on other people. Some popular examples of good sportsmanship include shaking hands, help an opponent who may have fallen over, encourage everyone, cheer, clap or hi-five, and be respectful to everyone including teammates, the opposition, parents and officials. Most importantly it is often encouraged and said regarding sportsmanship that \\"It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.\\" Sportsmanship can be manifested in different ways depending on the game itself or the culture of the group.  Contributing factors  Sportsmanship can be affected by a few contributing factors such as the players' values and attitudes towards the sport and also the professional role models that are shown to the public. Role models in sport are expected to act in a moral and respectful way. When elite sporting role models do not encourage sportsmanship this can also encourage people in society to act in similar ways to the athletes that they look up to and idolize. For example, if an individual looked up to an athlete who was drinking excessively, they may see this as acceptable behavior. The direct correlation between sportsmanship and leadership is also considered to be another contributing factor. Having a positive environment in your sporting team will therefore create good sportsmanship from the individuals. Having a positive leadership by the captains, coaches and supporters would then encourage a positive sporting environment.

Sometimes it is used as a verb, \\"to hypospray\\", meaning \\"to use a hypospray on (someone/something)\\". The concept of the hypospray was developed when producers on the original Star Trek series discovered that NBC's broadcast standards and practices prohibited the use of hypodermic syringes to inject medications; the needleless hypospray sidestepped this issue. The prop used in the original series appeared to be a modified fuel injector for a large automotive diesel engine, similar to the engines which jet injectors were derived from. In the Star Trek universe In the Star Trek universe, the hypospray was developed by the mid-22nd century, as it is featured in Star Trek: Enterprise. Many people, such as Dr. Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and The Doctor in Star Trek: Voyager, are seen to use it. The real-life jet injector is usually applied at the top of the arm, but the fictional hypospray is sometimes applied on the neck. Presumably when used in the neck it delivers the medication intravenously or intra-arterially and when used on the arm it delivers intramuscularly. The hypospray can also be applied through clothing. The hypospray is extremely versatile as the medicine vials can be quickly swapped out from the bottom of the hypospray. As the hypospray is bloodless, it is not contaminated by use. This allows it to be used on many people until the supply of medicine runs out. Real-world timeline :See also Jet injector#History. * 19th century: Workmen in France had accidental jet injections with high- powered grease guns * 1937 or earlier: Jet-injecting was known of as a type of workshop accident with diesel engines' fuel injectors. * 1947: First known use of the word \\"hypospray\\" for a real jet injector. * 23 November 1947: \\"The Comic Strip Killer\\" episode of the radio show The Shadow aired. In it, a hypospray is mentioned, as working \\"on the basis of a high-pressure air gun. You hold it against the skin and it blasts fluid, painlessly, through the pores. The patient doesn't even feel the injection.\\" The characters in the story were told that it was such a new device that the \\"first real publicity about it is in this week's Life Magazine\\". * 1956: Jack Vance's novel To Live Forever was published: in it, devices called hyposprays are used as drug injection devices. * 1957: Isaac Asimov's novel The Naked Sun mentions a \\"high-pressure needle jet\\" as an alternative to hypodermic needles. * 1960: A real working medical jet-injector was first patented - MadaJet. * 1965: A \\"hypospray\\" was mentioned in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. universe book, The Dagger Affair * 1966: Star Trek: The Original Series started airing, but real jet- injectors were not yet in common use. * 18 March 1967: The Mission: Impossible Season 1 Episode 24 (\\"The Train\\") aired, mentioning the hypospray. In it, Rollin Hand (Martin Landau) tells Dr. Selby (William Schallert) to \\"Get the hyposprays ready.\\" The doctor mentions \\"the spray will go right through his clothing and penetrate the skin.\\" * 2 February 2004: The television show Star Trek: Enterprise Episode 14 of Season 3 (\\"Stratagem\\") aired. It used an almost identical ploy as that used in the Mission: Impossible episode 'The Train' to trick the antagonist of the episode. ** Both the original Mission: Impossible and Star Trek series were made by Desilu Productions. In the real world For examples of a real jet injector being called a hypospray: see. Scientists at MIT developed a needle-free injection system in 2012. High pressure air injectors have been used by the military as a common initial entry vaccination method since at least the mid 1980s. They were linked to a bulk drug supply and a sterilized high pressure air supply (air compressor). Far from painless, they pushed in a portion of skin similar to the action of a needle, instead of the fiction of seeping slowly through the pores. Unlike a needle, the hole did not close itself, and usually left a small bleeding wound. After reducing the size of the injector from that of a refrigerator to the size of an electric razor, MIT-based startup Portal Instruments received funding from Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda in 2017 to develop and commercialize a needle- free hand-held injection device called PRIME. Loaded with a single-use disposable vessel, this device injects a hair thin stream at about 200 meters per second to penetrate skin and tissue with reportedly less pain than needles. *Research team discovers applications of a liquid salt compound, choline and geranate, capable of fostering antisepic absorption thru the skin in as little as 2 hours. While limited in scope and not instantaneous as the hyposprays of Trek, future application and study may increase scope and speed.

People responsible for leisure activities often seek recognition and respectability as sports by joining sports federations such as the International Olympic Committee, or by forming their own regulatory body. In this way sports evolve from leisure activity to more formal sports: relatively recent newcomers are BMX cycling, snowboarding, wrestling, etc. Some of these activities have been popular but uncodified pursuits for different lengths of time. Indeed, the formal regulation of sport is a relatively modern and increasing development. This method promotes a sport globally, in a very successful way. It also promotes the universality of each sport, by ensuring that the same gameplay rules are being practiced worldwide, using a standardized/homogenous international gameplay rule system (sanctioned by the respective international sports governing bodies) that is applied uniformly on all member associations and recognized leagues. Examples are FIFA in association football and FIBA in basketball, which have regulated international gameplay rules that are even practiced within US sports leagues today, despite not practicing them historically (which therefore meant that many US sports leagues weren't recognized by international governing bodies in the past, until they began to adopt international rules). In the sport of basketball the defender/defense cannot call foul. Formula One motor racing is an example of strict and changing regulation, where the regulating body appears to control rather than to simply define the sport. There have been major changes in the rules of F1 recently, almost on an annual basis, and more are planned. Sometimes this is done for safety reasons, sometimes to make the racing more interesting as a spectator sport, and sometimes to promote competition through involvement of smaller teams. Some changes make overtaking more probable for example or reduce the probability of an overwhelming technical advantage by any one team. Although heavily regulated, most people agree that the sport has thereby greatly benefitted, not least through dramatic leaps in safety. The degree of organisation can vary from national or worldwide competitions for the sport, or it can occur in a purely ad hoc, spontaneous way. A sport may be played individually (e.g. time trialling in cycling) or in a team, or just for recreation and well being (e.g. swimming). Some challenging situations have had to be dealt with when there is an overlap of the regulation of the sport with other forms of regulation, e.g. safety (There have been serious losses of life in football audiences, through stand collapses or poor crowd management), or simple laws of the land (Some inadvertent or otherwise physical interchanges occur between participants: when is it acceptable for the sport regulating authority alone to investigate and if necessary punish these? Can there be economic or public relations pressures affecting these issues?) The broadcasting of sports events is also highly regulated, with contracts limiting who can show footage.

First played on sandlots in particular, scoring and record-keeping gave baseball gravity. \\"Today,\\" notes John Thorn in The Baseball Encyclopedia, \\"baseball without records is inconceivable.\\" In 1871, the first professional baseball league was created. By the beginning of the 20th century, most large cities in the eastern United States had a professional baseball team. After several leagues came and went in the 19th century, the National League (founded in 1876) and American League (recognized as a major league in 1903) were established as the dominant leagues by the early 20th century. The most victorious team in each league was said to have won the \\"pennant;\\" the two pennant winners met after the end of the regular season in the World Series. The winner of at least four games (out of a possible seven) was the champion for that year. This arrangement still holds today, although the leagues are now subdivided and pennants are decided in post-season playoff series between the winners of each division. Baseball became popular in the 1920s, when Babe Ruth led the New York Yankees to several World Series titles and became a national hero on the strength of his home runs (balls that cannot be played because they have been hit out of the field). One of the most noteworthy players was the Brooklyn Dodgers' Jackie Robinson, who became the first African-American player in the major leagues in 1947. Prior to Robinson, black players had been restricted to the Negro Leagues. Starting in the 1950s, major league baseball expanded its geographical range. Western cities got teams, either by luring them to move from eastern cities or by forming expansion teams with players made available by established teams. Until the 1970s, because of strict contracts, the owners of baseball teams also virtually owned the players; since then, the rules have changed so that players can become free agents, within certain limits, to sell their services to any team. The resulting bidding wars led to increasingly wealthy players. Disputes between the players' union and the owners have at times halted baseball for months at a time. Japan has also seen a prominent professional baseball circuit develop known as Nippon Professional Baseball. Founded in 1934, the league emerged as an international force after World War II. NPB is considered to be the highest caliber of baseball outside the U.S. major leagues, and the best Japanese talent often emigrate to the U.S. by way of the posting system. Other prominent countries to play the game include South Korea (where their league has its own posting system with Major League Baseball), Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean states. =American football= Football (commonly known as American football in Europe and Australia) was professionalized in the 1890s as a slow, and initially covert, process; Pudge Heffelfinger and Ben \\"Sport\\" Donnelly were the first to secretly accept payment for playing the game in 1892. Regional leagues in Chicago, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York had coalesced in the 1900s and 1910s, most of which gave way to the American Professional Football Association in 1920. By 1920, pro football remained overshadowed by the college game. The first game involving an APFA team took place on September 26, 1920, at Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, as the hometown Independents flattened the St. Paul Ideals 48‚Äì0. The first head-to-head battles in the league occurred one week later as Dayton topped Columbus 14-0 and Rock Island pasted Muncie 45‚Äì0. Forward passes were rare, coaching from the sidelines was prohibited and players competed on both offense and defense. Money was so tight that George Halas carried equipment, wrote press releases, sold tickets, taped ankles, played and coached for the Decatur club. As opposed to today's standard 16-game schedule, clubs in 1920 scheduled their own opponents and could play non league and even college squads that counted toward their records. With no established guidelines, the number of games played‚Äîand the quality of opponents scheduled‚Äîby APFA teams varied, and the league did not maintain official standings. \\"The Birth of the National Football League.\\" History.com. A&E; Television Networks, 14 December 2014. Web. December 15, 2014. <>. The inaugural season was a struggle. Games received little attention from the fans‚Äîand even less from the press. According to Robert W. Peterson's book \\"Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football,\\" APFA games averaged crowds of 4,241. The association bylaws called for teams to pay a $100 entry fee, but no one ever did. The season concluded on December 19. At the conclusion of the season there were no playoffs (that innovation, although New York's regional league had used it, would not arrive until 1933) and it took more than four months before the league even bothered to crown a champion. Much as college football did for decades, the APFA determined its victor by ballot. On April 30, 1921, team representatives voted the Akron Pros, who completed the season undefeated with eight wins and three ties while yielding only a total of seven points, the champion in spite of protests by the one-loss teams in Decatur and Buffalo, who each had tied Akron and had more wins, thanks in part to Akron's owner presiding over the meeting. The victors received a silver loving cup donated by sporting goods company Brunswick-Balke-Collender. While players were not given diamond-encrusted rings, they did receive golden fobs in the shape of a football inscribed with the words \\"World Champions.\\" The whereabouts of the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup, only given out that one time, are unknown. The legacy of two APFA franchises continues on, however. The Racine Cardinals now play in Arizona, and the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and changed their name to the Bears the following year. Ten APFA players along with Carr are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which opened its doors in 1963 not far from the Canton automobile dealership that gave birth to the NFL in 1920. \\"The Birth of the National Football League.\\" History.com. A&E; Television Networks, December 14, 2014. Web. 15 December 2014. <>. The APFA, by 1922 known as the National Football League, has remained the predominant professional football league in the United States, and, effectively, the entire world. The evolution from a haphazard collection of teams in big and small cities to the much more rigid structure it is in the present was gradual. With most of the small-market teams except the Green Bay Packers squeezed out of the NFL by the time of the Great Depression, multiple attempts at teams in the major cities of Washington, New York, Detroit, Cleveland, and Philadelphia failed before, eventually, their current representatives took root (though Boston proved particularly problematic until the New England Patriots were accepted into the NFL in 1970); the NFL expanded coast-to-coast, the first of the four major leagues to do so, in 1946 with the Los Angeles Rams and admitted the San Francisco 49ers four years later; the NFL did not enter the Southern United States until admitting the Dallas Cowboys, Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints in the 1960s. A championship game was established in 1933, a draft was established in 1936, and schedules were standardized in the 1930s. A competing league has historically arisen to attempt to challenge the NFL's dominance every 10 to 15 years, but none managed to maintain long-term operations independent of the NFL and only two‚Äîthe All-America Football Conference of the late 1940s and the American Football League of the 1960s‚Äîwere strong enough to successfully compete against the league before the NFL subsumed their operations. Minor league football, although their leagues' memberships were unstable, began to arise in the late 1930s and remained viable as a business model up into the 1970s. A major factor in the NFL's rise to dominance was its embrace of television early in the sport's history. As college football heavily restricted the rights of its teams to broadcast games (a policy eventually ruled to be illegal in 1984), the NFL instead allowed games to be televised nationwide, except in a team's home city; the restriction was softened in the early 1970s, by which point the NFL had secured broadcast deals with all of the major television networks, another major factor in the inability of any competing league to gain traction since then. The related sport of Canadian football was eventually professionalized by the 1950s, which saw the evolution of the Canadian Football League. The CFL, despite losing all games in a series of contests against the NFL, was considered to be at least comparable in talent to the American leagues of the 1960s (its lone game against an AFL squad was a victory). Because Canada has a tenth of the population of the United States, the ability to make money from television was much lower, and although some of the cities of Canada were comparable to the major markets of the U.S., teams in places such as Saskatchewan and Hamilton were in markets quite small compared to even the small markets of the NFL, thus the CFL now pays noticeably less than other major professional leagues, but still more than enough to be considered fully professional. The rise of indoor American football beginning in the late 1980s has allowed for smaller-scale professional football to be viable. =Basketball= Australian women's basketball team celebrating after being awarded the gold medals for winning the 2006 FIBA World Championship Basketball was invented in 1891 and the first professional leagues emerged in the 1920s. The Basketball Association of America was established in 1946 and three years later became the modern National Basketball Association. The NBA was slower to establish dominance of the sport than other sports in the United States, as it would not do so until 1976, when it absorbed four teams from the American Basketball Association. Professional basketball has the advantages of much smaller rosters than other professional sports, allowing the sport to be viable in smaller cities than other sports. Professional basketball leagues of varying caliber can be found around the world, especially in Europe and South America. =Ice hockey= Ice hockey was first professionalized in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (decade). As Canadians made up the vast majority of hockey players, early American professional leagues imported almost all of their talent before Canadian leagues began to form in the wake of a mining boom, depriving the U.S. leagues and teams of talent. Two distinct circuits formed: the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in western Canada and the northwestern U.S., and the National Hockey Association of central Canada, both of which competed for the then- independent Stanley Cup. The NHA's teams reorganized as the National Hockey League in 1917, and the West Coast circuit died out by the mid-1920s. By 1926, the NHL expanded to 10 teams in Canada, and in the northeastern and midwestern United States. However, the onset of the Great Depression in 1930s, combined with Canada's entry into World War II (which greatly reduced the league's player pool), led to the league's retrenchment to six markets: Boston, New York City, Chicago and Detroit in the U.S., and Toronto and Montreal in Canada. These Original Six cities would be the only cities with NHL franchises from 1935 to 1967. During this time, the NHL was both stagnant and restrictive in its policies, giving teams territorial advantages, having teams with multiple owners in the same family (thus allowing the best players to be stacked onto certain teams), and restricting its players' salaries through reserve clauses. This stagnation allowed other leagues to arise: the Western Hockey League soon became the de facto major league of the western states and provinces, and the second-tier American Hockey League emerged in a number of midwestern markets the NHL had neglected, in addition to a handful of small towns. Amid pressure from television networks that were threatening to offer the WHL a contract, the NHL doubled in size in 1967, beginning a period of expansion that lasted through much of the 1970s. The last major challenger to the NHL's dominance was the World Hockey Association, which successfully broke the NHL's reserve clause in court, drove up professional hockey salaries, and continued to pressure the older league into expansion. The WHA merged four of its remaining teams into the NHL in 1979, but had to give up most of its players, as they were still under NHL contract and had to return to their original teams. The NHL made its last pronounced realignment in the 1990s, moving most of the WHA teams out of their markets and establishing a number of new teams in the southern United States. In Europe, the introduction of professionalism varied widely, and the highest-caliber league on the continent, the Soviet Championship League (proven to be at least equal to or better than the NHL in the 1970s), was officially composed of semi- professional works teams paid for their association with industries or government agencies (the Red Army squad employed members of the armed forces, and the Soviet Union often drafted the best hockey players in the country to serve on the squad). The modern-day descendant of the Soviet league, the Kontinental Hockey League, is fully professional and has a number of teams outside Russia, to the point where it has the resources to sign NHL veterans. Other European countries such as Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, and Austria also have prominent professional leagues. =Resistance to professionalism= Professional athleticism has been a traditional object of criticism by proponents of the amateurist philosophy of sport, according to which the central ethos of sport is competition performed for its own sake and pure enjoyment rather than as a means of earning a living. Examples of amateurist philosophy include the muscular Christianity movement that informed the promotion of sports in the English public school system, and the Olympism advocated by Pierre de Coubertin, a force behind the revival of the modern Olympic Games. The tension between the two sporting practices and ideals dates from the inception of modern organized sports in the 19th century. The high political and financial stakes involved in sport have ensured that this tension has remained strong. Professional sporting organizations have often developed as \\"rebel\\" organizations in relation to established national and international federation, for example the schism which created the code of rugby league. Arguments against amateurism often appeal to the argument that amateurism in sport favors the classes who can afford not to be paid to play, and is thus a covert form of prejudice against lower classes. Another argument is that amateur players are often de facto professionals who retain their amateur status by earning allowances instead of salaries. For example, all Eastern bloc countries were populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company (aircraft industry, food workers, tractor industry) or organization (KGB, Red Army, Soviet Air Force) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours social sports society team for their workers.Coffey, p. 59 Sports salaries Men involved in professional sports can earn a great deal of money at the highest levels. For instance, the highest-paid team in professional baseball is New York Yankees. Tiger Woods is the highest-paid athlete, totaling $127,902,706, including his endorsement income,¬´ The World's Highest-Paid Athletes ¬ª , peoplestar.co.uk, Retrieved on 11 October 2010. which massively exceeds what he earns from tournament golf. Woods recently became the world's first athlete to earn a billion dollars from prize money and endorsements. It would have taken the salary of two thousand 1980s professional golfers each making $58,500 to match up with Tiger Woods‚Äô current salary. Samuel Eto'o is the world's second highest-earning athlete and the highest-paid footballer in the world, raking in ¬£35.7 million (over $54 million) a year excluding off-field earnings. The top ten tennis players make about $3 million a year on average. Much of the growth in income for sports and athletes has come from broadcasting rights; for example, the most recent television contract for the NFL is valued at nearly US$5 billion per year. Women in the U.S., on the other hand, make much less, for example as of 2014, the WNBA enforced a maximum salary of US$107,000 for star players (coaches could earn double that). This is largely driven by the fact that the American viewing audience has far less interest in women's professional sport compared to men's; average in-person attendance and television viewership are both far higher for the NBA compared to the WNBA. According to investopedia.com, a male star like Kobe Bryant or LeBron James can individually earn a salary larger than every player in the WNBA combined. Outside the highest leagues, however, the money professional athletes can earn drops dramatically, as fan bases are generally smaller and television revenues are nonexistent. For instance, while the National Football League's teams can afford to pay their players millions of dollars each year and still maintain a significant profit, the second-highest American football league in the United States, the United Football League, consistently struggled to pay its bills and has continually lost money despite allotting its players only US$20,000 a year, and television networks made the league pay for television airtime instead of paying the league, making the league's business model unworkable.\\"Agent: Three UFL players haven't been paid yet,\\" from The Virginian-Pilot, 10 March 2012Davidson, Joe (10 October 2012).

In the United States and Canada, most lower-end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated farm teams, effectively agreeing to develop younger players for eventual play in the major leagues in exchange for subsidizing those players' salaries; this is known as the minor league system and is most prevalent in professional baseball and professional ice hockey. Otherwise, the league may be required to classify itself as semi-professional, in other words, able to pay their players a small sum, but not enough to cover the player's basic costs of living. Many professional athletes experience financial difficulties soon after retiring, due to a combination of bad investments, careless spending, and a lack of non-athletic skills. The wear and tear of a career in professional sport, can cause physical and mental side effects (such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a condition that has seen a massive rise in public awareness in the 2010s) that can harm a former professional athlete's employability. In the United States, some of these problems are mitigated by the fact that the college sports system ensures most professional athletes receive a college education with no student debt, a legacy that provides them with a career path after their sports career ends. =American football= In the NFL average annual salaries by position in 2009 were: * Quarterback $1,970,982 (note that this is a mean that covers both starting quarterbacks and backups; starters regularly draw salaries of over $10,000,000 as of 2016) * Running back $957,360 * Defensive tackle $1,223,925 =Association football= Chinese Super League The average salary of a player in the Chinese Super League was about ¬•10.7 million (¬£1 million) for the 2011 season, up from ¬•600,000 in the 2010 season.

After nearly two decades of participation in a religious movement that became the Shakers, in 1774 Ann Lee and a small group of her followers emigrated from England to New York. After several years, they gathered at Niskayuna, renting land from the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, Albany County, New York (the area now called Colonie). They worshiped by ecstatic dancing or \\"shaking\\", which resulted in them being dubbed the Shakers. Ann Lee preached to the public and led the Shaker church at a time when few women were religious leaders.In addition to Ann Lee, only nine women preachers have been identified before 1800. Catherine A. Brekus, Strangers and Pilgrims: Female Preaching in America, 1740‚Äì1845 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1998), 343‚Äì46. Early history Ann Lee was born in Manchester, England, and baptized privately at Manchester Collegiate Church (now Manchester Cathedral) on 1 June 1742,MS 12/1, Manchester Cathedral Archive at the age of 6. Her parents were members of a distinct branch of the Society of Friends, and too poor to afford their children even the rudiments of education. Ann Lee's father, John Lees, was a blacksmith during the day, and a tailor at night. It is probable that Ann Lee's original surname was Lees, but somewhere through time it changed to Lee. Little is known about her mother other than she was a very religious woman. As often happened in those days, the mother's name was not even recorded. When Ann was young she worked in a cotton factory, then she worked as a cutter of hatter's fur, and later as a cook in a Manchester infirmary. In 1758, she joined an English sect founded by Jane and preacher James Wardley; this was the precursor to the Shaker sect. She believed in and taught her followers that it is possible to attain perfect holiness by giving up sexual relations. Like her predecessors, the Wardleys, she taught that the shaking and trembling were caused by sin being purged from the body by the power of the Holy Spirit, purifying the worshiper. Beginning during her youth, Ann Lee was uncomfortable with sexuality, especially her own. This repulsion towards sexual activity continued and manifested itself most poignantly in her repeated attempts to avoid marriage and remain single. Eventually her father forced her to marry Abraham Stanley. They were married on 5 January 1761 at Manchester Collegiate Church.MS 13/3, Manchester Cathedral Archive She became pregnant four times, all of her children died during infancy. Her difficult pregnancies and the loss of four children were traumatic experiences that contributed to Ann Lee's dislike of sexual relations. Lee developed radical religious convictions that advocated celibacy and the abandonment of marriage, as well as the importance of pursuing perfection in every facet of life. She differed from the Quakers, who, though they supported gender equality, did not believe in forbidding sexuality within marriage. Rise to prominence In England, Ann Lee rose to prominence by urging other believers to preach more publicly concerning the imminent second coming, and to attack sin more boldly and unconventionally. She spoke of visions and messages from God, claiming that she had received a vision from God the message that celibacy and confession of sin are the only true road to salvation and the only way in which the Kingdom of God could be established on the earth. She was frequently imprisoned for breaking the Sabbath by dancing and shouting, and for blasphemy.Richard Francis, Ann the Word: The Story of Ann Lee, Female Messiah, Mother of the Shakers, The Woman Clothed with the Sun (New York: Arcade Publishing, 2000). She claimed to have had many miraculous escapes from death. She told of being examined by four clergymen of the Established Church, claiming that she spoke to them for four hours in 72 tongues. While in prison in Manchester for 14 days, she said she had a revelation that \\"a complete cross against the lusts of generation, added to a full and explicit confession, before witnesses, of all the sins committed under its influence, was the only possible remedy and means of salvation.\\" After this, probably in 1770, she was chosen by the Society as \\"Mother in spiritual things\\" and called herself \\"Ann, the Word\\" and also \\"Mother Ann.\\" After being released from prison a second time, witnesses say Mother Ann performed a number of miracles, including healing the sick.Answers.com Mother Ann Lee (section Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: Ann Lee) Lee eventually decided to leave England for America in order to escape the persecution (i.e. multiple arrests and stays in prison) she experienced in Great Britain. Move to America A group of Shakers, published in 1875 In 1774 a revelation led her to take a select band to America. She was accompanied by her husband, who soon afterwards deserted her. Also following her to America were her brother, William Lee (1740‚Äì1784); Nancy Lee, her niece; James Whittaker (1751‚Äì1787), who had been brought up by Mother Ann and was probably related to her; John Hocknell (1723‚Äì1799), who provided the funds for the trip; his son, Richard; James Shepherd, and Mary Partington. Mother Ann and her converts arrived on 6 August 1774, in New York City, where they stayed for nearly five years. In 1779 Hocknell leased land at Niskayuna, in the township of Watervliet, near Albany, and the Shakers settled there, where a unique community life began to develop and thrive. During the American Revolution, Lee and her followers maintained a stance of neutrality. Maintaining the position that they were pacifists, Ann Lee and her followers did not side with either the British or the colonists. Ann Lee opened her testimony to the world's people on the famous Dark Day in May 1780, when the sun disappeared and it was so dark that candles had to be lighted to see indoors at noon.Francis, Ann the Word, 130‚Äì31 She soon recruited a number of followers who had joined the New Light revival at New Lebanon, New York, in 1779, including Lucy Wright. Benjamin Osborn's house at Mount Washington. Beginning in the spring of 1781 Mother Ann and some of her followers went on an extensive missionary journey to find converts in Massachusetts and Connecticut. They often stayed in the homes of local sympathizers, such as the Benjamin Osborn House near the New York - Massachusetts line. There were also songs attributed to her which were sung without words. The followers of Mother Ann came to believe that she embodied all the perfections of God in female form, and was revealed as the \\"second coming\\" of Christ.Frederick William Evans. Shakers: Compendium of the Origin, History, Principles, Rules and Regulations, Government, and Doctrines of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing : with Biographies of Ann Lee, William Lee, Jas. Whittaker, J. Hocknell, J. Meacham, and Lucy Wright. Appleton; 1859. p. 26. The fact that Ann Lee was considered to be Christ's female counterpart was unique. She preached that sinfulness could be avoided by not only treating men and women equally, but also by keeping them separated so as to prevent any sort of temptation leading to impure acts. Celibacy and confession of sin were essential for salvation.Rufus Bishop and Seth Youngs Wells, comps., Testimonies of the Life, Character, Revelations and Doctrines of our Ever Blessed Mother Ann Lee (Hancock, Mass.: J. Talcott and J. Deming, Junrs., 1816); Seth Youngs Wells, comp., Testimonies Concerning the Character and Ministry of Mother Ann Lee (Albany, N.Y.: Packard and Van Benthuysen, 1827). Ann Lee's mission throughout New England was especially successful in converting groups who were already outside the mainstream of New England Protestantism, including followers of Shadrack Ireland. To the mainstream, however, she was too radical for comfort.Brekus, Strangers and Pilgrims: Female Preaching in America, 1740‚Äì1845, 343‚Äì46. Ann Lee herself recognized how revolutionary her ideas were when she said, \\"We [the Shakers] are the people who turned the world upside down.\\" The Shakers were sometimes met by violent mobs, such as in Shirley, Massachusetts, and Ann Lee suffered violence at their hands more than once. Because of these hardships Mother Ann became quite frail; she died on 8 September 1784, at the age of 48. Mother Ann Lee tombstone She died at Watervliet and is buried in the Shaker cemetery located in the Watervliet Shaker Historic District.Landmarks of American women's history, Chapter: Watervliet Shaker Historic District, Page Putnam Miller, Oxford University Press US, 2003, pp. 36 ff. It is claimed that Shakers in New Lebanon, New York experienced a 10-year period of revelations in 1837 called the Era of Manifestations. It was also referred to as Mother Ann's Work.

The involvement of political goals in sport is seen by some as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake, for the enjoyment of its participants, but this involvement has been true throughout the history of sport.Grant Jarvie, Sport, culture and society: an introduction (2013).  Sports diplomacy  Most sports are contested between national teams, which encourages the use of sporting events for nationalist purposes, whether intentionally or not. The signaling of national solidarity through sport is one of the primary forms of banal nationalism. Several sporting events are a matter of national pride; The Ashes is a matter of national pride between England and Australia. Also in cricket an India versus Pakistan match puts both countries on a virtual standstill as if it were all about national pride during those matches. The Olympic Games are the premier stage for nationalist competition, and its history reflects the history of political conflict since its inception at the end of the 19th century. The 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin was an illustration, maybe best acknowledged in hindsight, where an ideology was developing which used the event to strengthen its spread through propaganda. The boycott by the United States and politically aligned nations of the 1980 Summer Olympics and the Soviet Union and politically aligned nations of the 1984 Summer Olympics were part of the Cold War conflict.Christopher R. Hill, \\"The cold war and the Olympic movement.\\" History Today 49.1 (1999): 19+ When apartheid was the official policy in South Africa, many sportspeople adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects. Many African nations boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, as a result of then New Zealand Prime Minister Rob Muldoon allowing the All Blacks to tour South Africa. The issue would later come to a head during the 1981 Springbok Tour.Douglas Booth, \\"Hitting apartheid for six? The politics of the South African sports boycott.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 38.3 (2003): 477-493. George Orwell's essay \\"The Sporting Spirit\\" examines the effect nationalism plays on sport, where Orwell argues that various sporting events trigger violence between groups for the very reason of competition.  Nationalist sports  In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were clearly carried on with nationalist overtones: for example, for most of the last century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sport, if the person was seen to have played Association football, cricket, rugby or any other game which was of British origin.Patrick F. McDevitt, \\"Muscular Catholicism: Nationalism, masculinity and Gaelic team sports, 1884‚Äì1916.\\" Gender & History 9.2 (1997): 262-284.Mike Cronin, \\"Fighting for Ireland, playing for England? The nationalist history of the Gaelic athletic association and the English influence on Irish sport.\\" International Journal of the History of Sport 15.3 (1998): 36-56. The nationalistic Italian fascists also created Volata as their own home-grown alternative to soccer and rugby. It was intended to be a replacement for the popular games perceived to be of British origin that would be of a more local character, tracing its heritage back to the earlier Italian games of Harpastum and Calcio Fiorentino. However, unlike its Gaelic equivalents, Volata was short-lived and is no longer played.Making the Rugby World: Race, Gender, Commerce edited by Timothy J L Chandler and John Nauright (). See especially pages 92-94.  Clubs as symbols of rival communities  Athletic Bilbao only field Basque footballers, such as Iker Muniain In Scotland, the Old Firm derby in Glasgow featuring Celtic, historically linked to the city's Catholic community, and Rangers, similarly linked to the city's Protestant community, have also historically seen trends along ethno-political lines.The final whistle for God‚Äôs squad?, The Guardian, 27 February 1999 The policy of Spanish football team Athletic Bilbao of picking only Basque players is strongly linked to Basque nationalism.Mayr, Walter. How a Proud Basque Team Is Resisting Globalization. Der Spiegel. April 11, 2008Behind The Closed Doors Of Basque Country, Srinwantu Dey, Goalden Times, 18 October 2016 This causes disputes between Athletic Bilbao and other Basque teams due to the Bilbao squad being able to use their economic power to purchase players who play for other important Basque teams who have strong youth ranks, such as CA Osasuna and Real Sociedad de F√∫tbol. In the same vein, FC Barcelona have since the late 1990s promoted from youth ranks a series of Catalan players such as Xavi and Carles Puyol. Indeed, the club is widely seen as the de facto representative of Catalonia, extending the Autonomous Community's reach to areas it otherwise would not be able to influence. However, their local rivals RCD Espanyol usually field more Catalan players than FC Barcelona and the best Catalan goalscorer in La Liga history Ra√∫l Tamudo came through their youth ranks. In Canada, the Montreal Canadiens, the world's oldest and most successful professional ice hockey team, has always been a symbol for Francophone Quebeckers in Montreal. The teams has had rivalries in succession with the Anlgophone Quebec's Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Maroons, as well as English Canada's Toronto Maple Leafs. As well, from 1975 to 1995 there was a rivalry with the Quebec Nordiques from Quebec City, which took on political overtones, with Canadiens fans being more likely to be Liberals and federalists, and Nordiques fans more likely Pequists and sovereigntists.

The physical activity that developed into sports had early links with ritual, warfare and entertainment. Study of the history of sport can teach lessons about social changes and about the nature of sport itself, as sport seems involved in the development of basic human skills (compare play). As one delves further back in history, dwindling evidence makes theories of the origins and purposes of sport more and more difficult to support. As far back as the beginnings of sport, it was related to military training. For example, competition was used as a mean to determine whether individuals were fit and useful for service. Team sports were used to train and to prove the capability to fight in the military and also to work together as a team (military unit). Sports in prehistory Paintings of humans in the cave of swimmers Cave paintings found in the Lascaux caves in France appear to depict sprinting and wrestling in the Upper Paleolithic around 15,300 years ago. Cave paintings in the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia dating back to the Neolithic age ( show a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.Hartsell, Jeff., Wrestling 'in our blood,' says Bulldogs' Luvsandorj, 17 March 2011 Neolithic Rock art found at the cave of swimmers in Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Egypt shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 10,000 BCE. Prehistoric cave paintings in Japan depict a sport similar to sumo wrestling. It is likely that after the switch from hunter-gathering to farming becoming the primary means of providing food became dominant, those individuals who had previously been assigned to the Hunter role- and were likely naturally more physically built for the purpose- had little way to utilise their skill sets in a practical setting anymore, so instead entered a form of perpetual preperation for hunting and practicing the skills required, which then let to competative bouts intended to indicate whomever was the most \\"prepared\\" for the different elements of the hunt- for example the speed to chase down, strength to wrestle down or accuracy to rapidly dispatch the prey and associated wagering on the outcomes of contests, which them evolved gradually into what we would recognise as sports as we would know them today. Ancient Sumer An Egyptian burial chamber mural, from the tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum dating to around 2400 BCE, showing wrestlers in actionEgypt Thomb. Lessing Photo. 15 Feb 2011. Various representations of wrestlers have been found on stone slabs recovered from the Sumerian civilization. One showing three pairs of wrestlers was generally dated to around 3000 BCE. A cast Bronze figurine, (perhaps the base of a vase) has been found at Khafaji in Iraq that shows two figures in a wrestling hold that dates to around 2600 BCE. The statue is one of the earliest depictions of sport and is housed in the National Museum of Iraq. The origins of boxing have also been traced to ancient Sumer. The Epic of Gilgamesh gives one of the first historical records of sport with Gilgamesh engaging in a form of belt wrestling with Enkidu. The cuneiform tablets recording the tale date to around 2000 BCE; however, the historical Gilgamesh is supposed to have lived around 2800 to 2600 BCE. The Sumerian king Shulgi also boasts of his prowess in sport in Self-praise of Shulgi A, B and C. Fishing hooks not unlike those made today have been found during excavations at Ur, showing evidence of angling in Sumer at around 2600 BCE. Ancient Egypt The Charioteer of Delphi, Delphi Museum Monuments to the Pharaohs found at Beni Hasan dating to around 2000 BCE indicate that a number of sports, including wrestling, weightlifting, long jump, swimming, rowing, archery, fishing and athletics, as well as various kinds of ball games, were well-developed and regulated in ancient Egypt. Other Egyptian sports also included javelin throwing and high jump. An earlier portrayal of figures wrestling was found in the tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum in Saqqara dating to around 2400 BCE. Ancient Greece The Minoan art of Bronze Age Crete depict ritual sporting events - thus a fresco dating to 1500 BCE records gymnastics in the form of religious bull-leaping and possibly bullfighting. The origins of Greek sporting festivals may date to funeral games of the Mycenean period, between 1600 BCE and 1100 BCE. The Iliad includes extensive descriptions of funeral games held in honour of deceased warriors, such as those held for Patroclus by Achilles. Engaging in sport is described as the occupation of the noble and wealthy, who have no need to do manual labour themselves. In the Odyssey, king Odysseus of Ithaca proves his royal status to king Alkino√∂s of the Phaiakes by showing his proficiency in throwing the javelin. It was predictably in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE. These games took place every four years, or Olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. Initially a single sprinting event, the Olympics gradually expanded to include several footraces, run in the nude or in armor, boxing, wrestling, pankration, chariot racing, long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw. During the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their countries to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were wreaths of laurel leaves. Other important sporting events in ancient Greece included the Isthmian games, the Nemean Games, and the Pythian Games. Together with the Olympics, these were the most prestigious games, and formed the Panhellenic Games. Some games, e.g. the Panathenaia of Athens, included musical, reading and other non-athletic contests in addition to regular sports-events. The Heraean Games, held in Olympia as early as the 6th century BCE, were the first recorded sporting competition for women. Ancient sports elsewhere Sports that are at least two and a half thousand years old include hurling in Ancient Ireland, shinty in Scotland, harpastum (similar to rugby) in Rome, cuju (similar to association football) in China, and polo in Persia. The Mesoamerican ballgame originated over three thousand years ago. The Mayan ballgame of Pitz is believed to be the first ball sport, as it was first played around 2500 BCE.There are artifacts and structures that suggest that the Chinese engaged in sporting activities as early as 2000 BCE. Gymnastics appears to have been a popular sport in China's ancient past. Ancient Persian sports include the traditional Iranian martial art of Zourkhaneh. Among other sports that originated in Persia are polo and jousting. A polished bone implement found at Eva in Tennessee, United States and dated to around 5000 BCE has been construed as a possible sporting device used in a \\"ring and pin\\" game. Middle Ages Jousting at the Maryland Renaissance Festival For at least one hundred years, entire villages have competed with each other in rough, and sometimes violent, ballgames in England (Shrovetide football) and Ireland (caid). In comparison, the game of calcio Fiorentino, in Florence, Italy, was originally reserved for combat sports such as fencing and jousting being popular. Horse racing, in particular, was a favourite of the upper class in Great Britain, with Queen Anne founding the Ascot Racecourse. Development of modern sports A young cricketer by W.G. Grace, 1891 Some historians - most notably Bernard Lewis - claim that team sports as we know them today are primarily an invention of Western culture. British Prime Minister John Major was more explicit in 1995: :We invented the majority of the world's great sports.... 19th century Britain was the cradle of a leisure revolution every bit as significant as the agricultural and industrial revolutions we launched in the century before. The traditional team sports are seen as springing primarily from Britain, and subsequently exported across the vast British Empire. European colonialism helped spread particular games around the world, especially cricket (not directly related to baseball), football of various sorts, bowling in a number of forms, cue sports (like snooker, carom billiards, and pool), hockey and its derivatives, equestrian, and tennis, and many winter sports. The originally European-dominated modern Olympic Games generally also ensured standardization in particularly European, especially British, directions when rules for similar games around the world were merged. Regardless of game origins, the Industrial Revolution and mass production brought increased leisure which allowed more time to engage in playing or observing (and gambling upon) spectator sports, as well as less elitism in and greater accessibility of sports of many kinds. With the advent of mass media and global communication, professionalism became prevalent in sports, and this furthered sports popularity in general. With the increasing values placed on those who won also came the increased desire to cheat. Some of the most common ways of cheating today involve the use of performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids. The use of these drugs has always been frowned on but in recent history there have also been agencies set up to monitor professional athletes and ensure fair play in the sport. =England= The Ashes urn, competed for between Australia and England in cricket Writing about cricket in particular, John Leech has explained the role of Puritan power, the English Civil War, and the Restoration of the monarchy in England. The Long Parliament in 1642 \\"banned theatres, which had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, it is not clear if cricket was in any way prohibited, except that players must not break the Sabbath\\". In 1660, \\"the Restoration of the monarchy in England was immediately followed by the reopening of the theatres and so any sanctions that had been imposed by the Puritans on cricket would also have been lifted.\\"Leach (2005a) is a heavily annotated chronology of cricket 1300-1730 and the source for numerous entries here. He goes on to make the key point that political, social and economic conditions in the aftermath of the Restoration encouraged excessive gambling, so much so that a Gambling Act was deemed necessary in 1664. It is certain that cricket, horse racing and boxing (i.e., prizefighting) were financed by gambling interests. Leech explains that it was the habit of cricket patrons, all of whom were gamblers, to form strong teams through the 18th century to represent their interests. He defines a strong team as one representative of more than one parish and he is certain that such teams were first assembled in or immediately after 1660. Prior to the English Civil War and the Commonwealth, all available evidence concludes that cricket had evolved to the level of village cricket only where teams that are strictly representative of individual parishes compete. The \\"strong teams\\" of the post- Restoration mark the evolution of cricket (and, indeed of professional team sport, for cricket is the oldest professional team sport) from the parish standard to the county standard. This was the point of origin for major, or first-class, cricket. The year 1660 also marks the origin of professional team sport. A number of the public schools such as Winchester and Eton, introduced variants of football and other sports for their pupils. These were described at the time as \\"innocent and lawful\\", certainly in comparison with the rougher rural games. With urbanization in the 19th century, the rural games moved to the new urban centres and came under the influence of the middle and upper classes. The rules and regulations devised at English institutions began to be applied to the wider game, with governing bodies in England being set up for a number of sports by the end of the 19th century. The rising influence of the upper class also produced an emphasis on the amateur, and the spirit of \\"fair play\\". The industrial revolution also brought with it increasing mobility, and created the opportunity for universities in Britain and elsewhere to compete with one another. This sparked increasing attempts to unify and reconcile various games in England, leading to the establishment of the Football Association in London, the first official governing body in football. For sports to become professionalized, coaching had to come first. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.Dave Day, Professionals, Amateurs and Performance: Sports Coaching in England, 1789‚Äì1914 (2012) Sport became an important part of military life for British servicemen serving around the world. =The British Empire and post-colonial sports= The influence of British sports and their codified rules began to spread across the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly association football. A number of major teams elsewhere in the world still show these British origins in their names, such as A.C. Milan in Italy, Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense in Brazil, and Athletic Bilbao in Spain. Cricket became popular in several of the nations of the then British Empire, such as Australia, South Africa, India and Pakistan, and remain popular in and beyond today's Commonwealth of Nations. The revival of the Olympic Games by Baron Pierre de Coubertin was also heavily influenced by the amateur ethos of the English public schools.Harold Perkin, \\"Teaching the nations how to play: sport and society in the British empire and Commonwealth.\\" The International Journal of the History of Sport 6.2 (1989): 145-155. The British played a major role in defining amateurism, professionalism, the tournament system and the concept of fair play.Sigmund Loland, \\"Fair play in sports contests-a moral norm system.\\" Sportwissenschaft 21.2 (1991): 146-162. Some sports developed in England, spread to other countries and then lost its popularity in England while remaining actively played in other countries, a notable example being bandy which remains popular in Finland, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Baseball (closely related to English rounders and French la soule, and less clearly connected to cricket) became established in the urban Northeastern United States, with the first rules being codified in the 1840s, while American football was very popular in the south-east, with baseball spreading to the south, and American football spreading to the north after the Civil War. There is documented evidence of baseball in England. An extract from an 18th-century diary containing the oldest known reference to baseball is among the items on display in a new exhibition in London exploring the English origins and cricketing connections of America's national sport. While baseball was once claimed to have been invented in the U.S. in the mid-19th century, recent findings suggest a sport of the same name may have evolved decades earlier alongside cricket, crossing the Atlantic with English settlers to the American colonies. One notable discovery found in a shed in a village in Surrey, southern England, in 2008 was a handwritten 18th-century diary belonging to a local lawyer, William Bray. \\"Went to Stoke church this morn.,\\" wrote Bray on Easter Monday in 1755. \\"After dinner, went to Miss Jeale's to play at base ball with her the 3 Miss Whiteheads, Miss Billinghurst, Miss Molly Flutter, Mr. Chandler, Mr. Ford and H. Parsons. Drank tea and stayed til 8.\\" In the 1870s the game split between the professionals and amateurs; the professional game rapidly gained dominance, and marked a shift in the focus from the player to the club. The rise of baseball also helped squeeze out other sports such as cricket, which had been popular in Philadelphia prior to the rise of baseball. American football (and gridiron football more generally) also has its origins in the English variants of the game, with the first set of intercollegiate football rules based directly on the rules of the Football Association in London. However, Harvard chose to play a game based on the rules of Rugby football. Walter Camp would then heavily modify this variant in the 1880s, with the modifications also heavily influencing the rules of Canadian football. American footballers tackling Worldwide, the British influence includes many different football codes, lawn bowls, lawn tennis and other sports. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawn mower in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National Ockham's Razor, first broadcast 6 June 2010. =United States= Most sports in the United States evolved out of European practices. However, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. However, Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.Elliott J. Gorn, A Brief History of American Sports (2004)S.W. Pope, ed. The new American sport history: recent approaches and perspectives (U of Illinois Press, 1997). = Around the world = The 21st century has seen a move towards adventure sports as a form of individual escapism, transcending the routines of life. Examples include white water rafting, paragliding, canyoning, base jumping and more genteelly, orienteering. Women's sport history UCSD women's soccer players fighting over ball Women's competition in sports has been frowned upon by many societies in the past. The English public-school background of organised sport in the 19th and early 20th century led to a paternalism that tended to discourage women's involvement in sports, with, for example, no women officially competing in the 1896 Olympic Games. The 20th century saw major advances in the participation of women in sports due to a growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America. This led to the initiation of the Women's Olympiad (held three times 1921, 1922 and 1923) and the Women's World Games (held four times (1922, 1926, 1930 and 1934. In 1924 the 1924 Women's Olympiad was held in London. Although women's participation as fans, administrators, officials, coaches, journalists, and athletes remains in general less than men's. The increase in girls' and women's participation in sport has been partly influenced by the women's rights and feminist movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, respectively. In the United States, female students‚Äô participation in sports was significantly boosted by the Title IX Act in 1972, which forbade gender discrimination in all aspects of any educational environment that uses federal financial aid,Britt, M. & Timmerman, M. 'Title IX and Higher Education: The Implications for the 21st Century' in \\"Franklin Business and Law Journal\\", Vol. 2014, No. 1. (March 2014), pp. 83-86. leading to increased fundingReinbrecht, E. 'Northwestern University and Title IX: One Step Forward for Football Players, Two Steps Back for Female Student Athletes' in \\"University of Toledo Law Review\\", Vol. 47, No. 1. (September 2015), pp. 243-277. and support to develop female athletes. Pressure from sports funding bodies has also improved gender equality in sports. For example, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the Leander Club (for rowing) in England had both been male-only establishments since their founding in 1787 and 1818, respectively, but both opened their doors to female members at the end of the 20th century at least partially due to the requirements of the United Kingdom Lottery Sports Fund. The 21st century has seen women‚Äôs participation in sport at its all-time highest. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, women competed in 27 sports over 137 events, compared to 28 men‚Äôs sports in 175 events.Pfister, G. 'Outsiders: Muslim Women and Olympic Games - Barriers and Opportunities' in \\"The International Journal of the History of Sport\\", Vol. 27, Nos. 16-18. (November‚ÄìDecember 2010), pp. 2925-2957. Several national women's professional sports leagues have been founded and are in competition, and women‚Äôs international sporting events such as the FIFA Women's World Cup, Women's Rugby World Cup, and Women's Hockey World Cup continue to grow.

Some international sports federations like the International Swimming Federation and the International Skating Union may oversee multiple activities referred to in common parlance as separate sports: FINA, for example governs swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, and water polo as separate 'disciplines' within the single 'sport' of Aquatics. International sports federations form an integral part of the Olympic and Paralympic movements. Each Olympic sport is represented by its respective international sport federation, which in turn help administer their respective events during the Games. For a sport to become an Olympic sport, its respective international sport federation must be recognized by the International Olympic Committee. Likewise, an international sports federation must be recognized by the International Paralympic Committee for its sport to become a paralympic sport, though in the latter case, several Paralympic Sports are governed by a dedicated committee of the International Paralympic Committee itself, under the World Para branding, for example track and field athletics for disabled athletes is governed by the IPC itself, under the name World Para Athletics. Other Paralympic sports are governed within the structure of the able-bodied equivalent: for example, the UCI governs both able-bodied and paralympic cycling.

Fantagraphics Books. The name \\"Hellfire Club\\" in fact has a historical precedent, having been a popular name for gentlemen's clubs in the 18th century. Additionally, the hierarchy of the Inner Circle is modeled on the pieces of a chess set, with Black and White sets of Kings, Queens, Bishops and Rooks. The Hellfire Club and its Inner Circle were introduced in \\"The Dark Phoenix Saga\\", attempting to subvert the X-Men's Jean Grey.Uncanny X-Men #129-135 This incarnation, composed most notably of Black King Sebastian Shaw and White Queen Emma Frost, would remain prominent for many years. After their initial confrontations, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men settled into an uneasy alliance.Uncanny X-Men #209New Mutants (vol. 1) #51 This eventually changed as endless power struggles perpetuated a series of upheavals within the Inner Circle. The club has appeared in two X-Men animated series (X-Men: The Animated Series and Wolverine and the X-Men), both times being renamed as simply The Inner Circle, due to the hesitations to use the word Hellfire in animated children series. Members of the Hellfire Club appeared in 2011's X-Men: First Class as the main villains, led by Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Azazel and Riptide. The Hellfire Club‚Äôs Inner Circle also appear as the main antagonists of the second season of the television series The Gifted led by a character named Reeva Payge played by Grace Byers, and the Frost sisters played by Skyler Samuels. Publication history In creating the Hellfire Club, Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne drew heavily upon a 1966 episode of the British spy series The Avengers entitled \\"A Touch of Brimstone\\". In the episode, agents John Steed and Emma Peel attempt to infiltrate a secret society named after the Hellfire Club of the 18th century, whose members of the \\"Inner Circle\\" all wear period costumes. Emma Peel's guise as \\"the Queen of Sin\\", dressed in a black leather corset, would be the model for the Club's Queens, her first name even borrowed for White Queen Emma Frost. The leader of the episode's club was played by actor Peter Wyngarde, best known for his role as Jason King, forming the basis for Mastermind's new \\"Jason Wyngarde\\" identity. The other members of Claremont and Byrne's Hellfire Club were similarly drawn from the names and faces of famous actors: Sebastian Shaw was based on actor Robert Shaw, Harry Leland on Orson Welles (who acted as Harry Lime in The Third Man and whose film Citizen Kane featured a reporter named Jed Leland), and Donald Pierce was based on Donald Sutherland (the surname referencing his Hawkeye Pierce character from M*A*S*H). Later writers would further the references to The Avengers: Sir Patrick and Lady Diana, from the Philadelphia branch of the 1780s, are named after actors Patrick Macnee (John Steed) and Diana Rigg (Mrs. Emma Peel); conversely, the Black Queen of the London branch was revealed to be named Ms. Emma Steed.Excalibur (vol. 1) #99 Overview The Hellfire Club counts among its members the most famous, wealthy, and influential members of society. Membership is passed on to descendants, and can also be earned through wealth or influence. While many accept the invitation simply for the pleasures that the Club offers, others seek wealth and influence. In fact, the purpose of the Hellfire Club is to obtain and exert power through politics and economic influence instead of outward conquest and domination. Since its foundation, the Hellfire Club has been involved in wars and assassinations to further the agendas of the Club's most powerful members. The Club has branches in New York City, London, Hong Kong, and Paris; the various branches are all overseen by the Lord Imperial (a position long-held by Sir Gordon Phillips).X-Treme X-Men #3 Unbeknownst to most members is the Club's Inner Circle. Originally known as the Council of the Chosen, this secret group formed around Edward \\"Ned\\" Buckman, each member assuming the titles of the major chess pieces. As White King, Buckman financed Stephen Lang's revived Sentinel program with the assistance of probationary member Sebastian Shaw.Uncanny X-Men #100 Shaw, now Black Bishop, began securing allies within the Club, meeting Harry Leland, Emma Frost, and Donald Pierce, as well as his loyal assistant, Tessa.X-Men: The Hellfire Club #4 Buckman, no longer having a use for the dangerously- ambitious Shaw, ordered a Sentinel attack on Shaw and his allies, resulting in the death of Shaw's lover, Lourdes Chantel. That night, Shaw and Emma Frost purged the entire Council of the Chosen, remaking it as the Lords Cardinal and appointing themselves Black King and White Queen.Classic X-Men #6-7 Shaw's Inner Circle soon turned their attentions to the X-Men, kidnapping several of their number. Mastermind, as Jason Wyngarde, was made a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men's Jean Grey. Jean Grey was in fact the Phoenix, a god-like cosmic entity who became unstable after Mastermind's psychic manipulations, turning into the Dark Phoenix. The Hellfire Club had failed, and the X-Men had taken their toll: Phoenix had driven Mastermind insane, Colossus had crippled Donald Pierce and Wolverine nearly killed Harry Leland and several guards.Uncanny X-Men #132-135 Despite such setbacks, the Inner Circle continued to pursue its agenda. Shaw, using his connections to Senator Robert Kelly to initiate Project: Wideawake, secured a government contract for Shaw Industries to manufacture Sentinels, profiting from the state of fear concerning the \\"mutant menace\\" despite secretly being a mutant himself. Frost meanwhile ran the Massachusetts Academy, a prestigious preparatory school affiliated with the Hellfire Club that secretly trained a team of young mutants, known as the Hellions. The Inner Circle also underwent some personnel changes, notably the expulsion of Donald Pierce for conspiring against his mutant colleagues, and the addition of Selene as Black Queen.Uncanny X-Men #189 Although the hierarchy of the Inner Circle goes through constant upheaval due to the competing egos and political motives of its members, it continues to exist in the same basic structure today. Magneto briefly took the title of Grey King after Sebastian Shaw was voted out of the Inner Circle,New Mutants (vol. 1) #75 and with Emma Frost he began plotting against Black Queen Selene, having planted Hellion Empath into Nova Roma via his relationship with New Mutant Magma prior to ousting Shaw. However, when Magneto discovered the X-Man Rogue alive and well in the Savage Land (where Magneto was visiting), Magneto abandoned the Hellfire Club and ultimately went into exile when he was rejected by Rogue when he murdered the Savage Land priestess Zaladane. Meanwhile, Emma Frost attempted to force former Hellion Firestar to rejoin the Hellions but was rebuked by Firestar and her new teammates in the New Warriors.New Warriors (vol. 1) #10 Disjointed, Selene exploited the chaos to launch a pre-emptive strike to slaughter the Lord Cardinals with aid from a group of young mutant \\"Upstarts\\" who were loyal to Selene. Points for each kill were awarded by the Gamesmaster and Magneto, Shaw, Pierce, and Frost were all targeted, before Selene herself was betrayed by Trevor Fritzroy and Gamemaster. During this time the Inner Circle of the London branch was working behind the American branch's back and was influencing Parliament and the secret government agency Black Air. Captain Britain (Brian Braddock) held a position for a short term on Shinobi Shaw's advisement to investigate its activities as they had mutual objectives. Excalibur collected evidence of their crimes and the Inner Circle was either arrested or went into hiding. The Upstarts' uprising was quashed by Sebastian Shaw. He reinstated some of the old Inner Circle until he disbanded it due to his own invested interest in business pursuits. The Club still continued loosely partly due to Selene's influence, although it never had the same prestige as the original. Sebastian Shaw again reformed a variation of the original Inner Circle with a nobler outlook posing as a force for good, which may have been a deception on his part. Tessa/Sage rejoined the Inner Circle to observe this and to assist Roberto da Costa's usurping the position of Lord Imperial which Shaw had claimed. The Hellfire Club was next under the leadership of Roberto da Costa as the Lord Imperial aided by Sage. Sat-Yr-9 (under the guise of Courtney Ross) as the new White Queen, aided by her assassin Viper, her \\"Warrior White Princess\\". As with many members in the past, both Sat-Yr-9 and Viper have their own personal agendas. Following M-Day, Sunspot remains as Lord Imperial, while Shaw resumes his activities, though under Sunspot's close watch. While Sat-Yr-9's whereabouts remain unknown, Viper returns to Madripoor to oversee HYDRA operationsNew Avengers #42 and Sage became a member of the short-lived New Excalibur, only to end up as one of the Exiles. When the X-Men and many other powered or depowered mutants came to San Francisco, an offshoot of the Club, known as the Hellfire Cult, begins attacking mutants and \\"species traitors\\". Officially, their leadership appears to be Empath, but the real power behind the scenes is the mysterious Red Queen. Their activities draw the attention of the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men 500-502 (2008) Kade Kilgore later took control of the Hellfire Club. Kilgore founded the Hellfire Academy where he recruited mutant outlaws as its faculty and started looking for students to attend this school. The Hellfire Academy serves as the direct opponent for the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.Wolverine and the X-Men #23 Organization =Lord Imperial= The Lord Imperial is not a member of the Inner Circle or any particular branch of the Hellfire Club; the Lord Imperial is the true leader of the Hellfire Club and oversees all branches of it. As such, only a few individuals have held the title. Sir Gordon Phillips, while unknown at the time, ruled as Lord Imperial for most of the club's modern history, holding the position from before the club's introduction until his death from the Legacy Virus.Uncanny X-Men #388 * Sir Gordon Phillips * Elias Bogan * Sebastian Shaw * Roberto da Costa (Sunspot) =Inner Circle= The constant intrigue, backstabbing, blackmailing and politicking that plague the Hellfire Club have resulted in many changes of the Inner Circle, as new players seek out membership in order to obtain influence, power and wealth. The following lists the membership of each incarnation of the Inner Circle and the title they held; in descending order of rank are Kings and Queens, followed by Bishops and Rooks. The Council of the Chosen The original Inner Circle (existing prior to the club's introduction) consisted of: * Edward \\"Ned\\" Buckman - White King * Paris Seville - White Queen * Sebastian Shaw - Black Bishop Sebastian Shaw was instrumental in the Hellfire Club's funding of Stephen Lang's resurrected Sentinel program, but having completed his purpose, White King Ned Buckman sought to eliminate the ambitious Black Bishop. After a Sentinel attack on Shaw's beach house resulted in the death of his lover, Lourdes Chantel, Shaw and his ally Emma Frost purged the entire Council in one night and appointed themselves its Black King and White Queen. The Lords Cardinal Shaw renamed The Council of the Chosen as The Lords Cardinal following his takeover of the New York branch, and appointed a number of allies to key positions. Frost began running the Massachusetts Academy at this time. Jason Wyngarde, also known as Mastermind, later became a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men's Jean Grey into the Club's Black Queen. * Sebastian Shaw - Black King * Emma Frost - White Queen * Donald Pierce - White Bishop * Harry Leland - Black Bishop * Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind) - A probationary member who was presumably intended for one of the two Rooks. * Phoenix (posing as Jean Grey) - Black Queen * Tessa - Shaw's personal aide. * Warhawk - Associate of the Hellfire Club. Following Mastermind's failed subversion of Jean Grey, the title of Black Queen was once again empty. Donald Pierce reached the rank of White King but was later expelled for conspiring against his mutant colleagues.Marvel Graphic Novel #4 New members appointed during this period were: * Selene: - Black QueenNew Mutants (vol. 1) #23 * Friedrich Von Roehm - Black RookNew Mutants (vol. 1) #22 * Emmanuel da Costa - White Rook A truce between the Hellfire Club and the X-Men began after an encounter with Nimrod resulted in the deaths of Leland and von Roehm. This truce soon grew into a formal alliance as Storm and Magneto, as the leaders of the X-Men and Xavier's school respectively, took over the shared position of White King. * Storm - White King (with Magneto) * Magneto - White King, later Grey King Storm and the X-Men would later seemingly die, leaving Magneto alone to deal with the Inner Circle. After a protracted power struggle, Magneto turned Emma Frost and Selene against Shaw and expelled him from Inner Circle, assuming both mantles as the new Grey King.New Mutants (vol. 1) #75 Magneto, while never formally resigning, would soon withdraw from the club, after relocating to Savage Land to deal with the threat of the villainess Zaladane.Uncanny X-Men #269 Meanwhile, Selene would turn against Frost and Magneto after learning that the two had sent Empath (one of Emma's students) to Selene's Amazon fortress Nova Roma in order to subvert Selene's granddaughter Magma. Selene would create \\"The Upstarts\\", a group of young and wealthy mutants who replace the Hellfire Club. Organizing a \\"game\\" where whichever member killed the most Hellfire Club members would rule the group, Emma Frost's students in the Hellfire Club were slaughtered by Trevor Fitzroy and Emma herself put into a coma. Fitzroy also \\"killed\\" Donald Pierce and his Reavers. Magneto meanwhile, having relocated to Asteroid M, invited a young healer named Fabian Cortez and his group known as the Acolytes to stay with him. Cortez (whose power was to boost other mutants abilities) manipulated Magneto into declaring war upon the X-Men and ultimately hijacked control over a SHIELD orbital weapons platform, to blow up Asteroid M, seemingly killing Magneto. Sebastian Shaw would be \\"killed\\" by Shinobi Shaw, a young mutant who was fathered by Harry Leland but raised by Sebastian as his son.Uncanny X-Men #281-282, X-Men #1-3, X-Factor #67 In retaliation, Empath used his powers to manipulate all of Nova Roma (including Magma) into thinking they were kidnapped victims of Selene's, who had been manipulated due to her mind control powers, into thinking they were citizens of an ancient, long lost Roman settlement in South America.New Warriors #31 Selene however, would soon fall prey to her new allies own wrath as Trevor Fitzroy and Selene's ally, the Gamemaster, turned against her and allowed Gamemaster to take control over the Upstarts. White Rook Emmanuel da Costa was also killed around this period, though his death was unrelated to the agenda of the Upstarts. A group of immortal mutants known as the Externals, became aware of a prophecy that one of the New Mutants was destined to play a major role in the salvation of the planet. The prophecy referenced two New Mutants in particular, de Costa's son Sunspot and the New Mutant Cannonball, one of which potentially possessed the secondary mutation of immortality and the destiny of savior of mutantkind.X-Force #21-23 As Cable infiltrated the New Mutants under the notion that Cannonball was to be the immortal messiah, the External's leader Gideon sought to corrupt Sunspot, who was the messiah promised in the prophecy.X-Force #11-16, Avengers World #19-21 Already a family friend, Gideon had de Costa's secretary poison the White Rook in order to force his super-hero son to leave the New Mutants and take leadership of his family's company.New Mutants (vol. 1) #98 When Cannonball survived a near fatal impaling (which Cable mistook as being the result of his being immortal), Gideon turned on Sunspot who was ultimately rescued by X-Force.X-Force #15 With exception of de Costa; all of the Hellfire Club Lord Cardinals killed by the Upstarts, later recovered. Sebastian Shaw faked his death, as did Magneto. Donald Pierce was rebuilt by Stryfe along with the rest of the Reavers, while Emma Frost recovered from her coma and repented her evil ways. Shinobi Shaw's Upstart Inner Circle Selene had originally planned on creating a new Inner Circle with the help of the Upstarts - among them Shinobi Shaw, son of Sebastian Shaw - but they betrayed and imprisoned her. Believing to have successfully assassinated his father,X-Factor (vol. 1) #67 Shinobi Shaw briefly took over the New York branch of the Club, seemingly with support from the External Candra. He offered membership in his Inner Circle to Archangel, Storm,X-Men (vol. 2) Annual #3 and Sunspot (also known as Roberto da Costa, son of former White Rook Emmanuel da Costa),X-Force (vol. 1) #62 but all declined. * Shinobi Shaw - Black King * Benedict Kine - White King * Benazir Kaur - White Queen * Reeva Payge - Black Queen * Candra - Associate * Cordelia Frost - Probationary member * Ebon Knights - Shinobi Shaw's Black Guard * Ivory Knights - Benedict Kine's White Guard The titles of Payge and Kaur are not established. When Cordelia Frost (younger sister of Emma) applies for membership to the Inner Circle, Shinobi states that the title of White Queen is already taken.Generation X Annual '95 Shinobi Shaw's actions as Black King were limited to failed attempts at extending his influence and monitoring the London branch of the Club. The London Branch The Hellfire Club's London branch is introduced briefly operating parallel to Shinobi's Inner Circle.Excalibur (vol. 1) #96 Instead of Black and White, the titles of the London Inner Circle are designated Black and Red. * Emma Steed - Black QueenMarvel Atlas #1 * Margali Szardos - Red Queen * Quentin Templeton - Black King * Alan Wilson - Red King * Brian Braddock (Captain Britain) - Black Bishop * Conrad Strathdee - Red Bishop * Jane Hampshire (possessed by Mountjoy) - Red Rook * Rutledge - Servant Captain Britain, having inherited club membership from his father, Sir James Braddock, was asked by Shinobi Shaw to infiltrate the London Inner Circle, as the branch's mysterious agenda surely ran counter to both their interests. The London Branch and their plans were soon brought to an end after a failed attempt to use a demon's essence to control the city.Excalibur (vol. 1) #99-100 The Black Queen and Red King were taken into police custody. Shaw's Second Circle Sebastian Shaw, despite his apparent death, later re-emergedX-Force (vol. 1) #48 and retook control of the Hellfire Club in attempt to restore its former power and glory. Selene, freed from her imprisonment by the Upstarts, took under her influence a resurrected Madelyne Pryor in her quest for revenge.X-Man #7X-Man #13X-Man #16-17 Shaw meanwhile attempted to ally with the AOA-exile Holocaust. Meeting in New York, Shaw proposes a reformation of the Inner Circle with the following line-up:X-Man #20-22 At first operating in secret from outside the Hellfire Club (still under Shinobi Shaw's control), Sebastian's group soon reasserted control over the organization.X-Man #28 * Sebastian Shaw - Black King * Selene - Black Queen * Trevor Fitzroy - White Rook * Madelyne Pryor - Red Queen * Donald Pierce - Applicant for White Bishop * Tessa - Shaw's personal aide * Ella - Selene's personal servant * Holocaust - Associate * Miss Hoo - Associate Selene's mind control over Madelyne Pryor eventually waned, and the Black Rook's allegiance soon turned to Sebastian Shaw.X-Man #24-25 Concerned, Selene contacted Fitzroy and Tessa to counteract the changing balance of power. Donald Pierce returned to the Hellfire Club as a probationary member,Cable #47 however his failure in attaining the alien technology of Apocalypse resulted in his expulsion from the group.Cable #50-53 Pryor meanwhile had betrayed and deserted the club. Shaw, presented with a mysterious offer,X-Men (vol. 2) #72 decided to accept its terms and resign from the Inner Circle, advising Fitzroy to do the same. Selene's Hellfire Club Selene, finding herself the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, reformed the club in her own image and allied with the ruler of Hell, Blackheart. After a confrontation with the Fantastic Four, Blackheart is imprisoned and Selene's captive Daimon Hellstrom is freed; Hellstorm then became the club's White King to ensure a balance of power and light.Fantastic Four Annual '99 Selene would later successfully induct Sunspot (Roberto da Costa, son of former Black Rook Emmanuel da Costa) into the Inner Circle,X-Force (vol. 1) #98-100 offering the resurrection of his long-dead girlfriend, Julianna, who died saving his life.Marvel Graphic Novel #4 (\\"The New Mutants\\") * Selene - Black Queen * Blackheart - Black King * Daimon Hellstrom - White King * Roberto da Costa (Sunspot) - Black Rook It is unknown what led to the dissolution of this incarnation. The Hellfire Club was found closed and abandoned, covered in blackbriar thorns; Selene herself was trapped inside the mansion, unable to leave.Uncanny X-Men #452 The Fifth Inner Circle After the death of Sir Gordon Phillips at the hands of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Sebastian Shaw positioned himself as the new Lord Imperial and, as such, oversaw the entire Hellfire Club. * Sebastian Shaw - Lord Imperial * Roberto da Costa (Sunspot) - Black King * Selene - Black Queen * Sat-Yr-9 (as Courtney Ross) - White Queen * Viper - White Warrior Princess * Tessa - Shaw's personal aide and Sunspot's personal adviser. * Red Lotus - Associate Selene, despite remaining imprisoned underneath the Hellfire Club's New York mansion and not actively participating in the Inner Circle, has apparently retained her title of Black Queen. It was also revealed that Emma Frost, despite having left the club long ago and having since joined the X-Men, still retained her membership and White Queen title. Sat-Yr-9 confronts Emma Frost and, assuming her title, becomes the newest addition to the Inner Circle, bringing with her bodyguard and self-appointed \\"White Warrior Princess\\" Viper. A confrontation with Donald Pierce leaves Sebastian Shaw gravely injured, and Sunspot takes over as Lord Imperial, which was Tessa's plan all along. Tessa left the Club, still under Sunspot's rule, and joined New Excalibur in the wake of M-Day. Shaw has since returned as the Black King, seemingly plotting to rebuild his power base. Nova's Inner Circle Emma Frost's illusory Inner Circle (left to right): Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Perfection, Cassandra Nova, and Sebastian Shaw * Emma Frost * Sebastian Shaw * Perfection * Cassandra Nova * Negasonic Teenage Warhead A mysterious new Inner Circle emerged in the pages of 'Astonishing X-Men' volume 3. Members of this version were never given titles since they were revealed to be psionic projections created by Emma Frost at the behest of Cassandra Nova. In an attempt to free herself the X-Men, Cassandra had placed a portion of her consciousness in Frost's prior to being mentally imprisoned and launched an assault on the X-Mansion by using Emma as a Trojan horse. Other than Cassandra Nova, each member appears to represent a different aspect of Emma's past with Negasonic Teenage Warhead being a former student of hers who died in Genosha; Perfection, a manifestation of Emma's younger, evil self and Sebastian Shaw representing her time with the Hellfire Club.Astonishing X-Men (vol. 3) #13-18 Selene's second Inner Circle Selene, finding herself once again the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, and disappointed by the many betrayals from Sebastian Shaw and his Hellfire Club, decided it was time to rise to goddesshood, a state she believed she was destined for.X-Necrosha #1 To accomplish that, she specifically recruited a Coven of deadly mutants to seek revenge against all those that had betrayed her or stood in her way in the past. Together they went to the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, where she cut all ties with them by using her new Inner Circle to slaughter every person there. This Inner Circle was made up of mostly by mutants whose abilities were designed for killing. Membership consisted of: * Blink * Senyaka * Mortis * Wither * Eli Bard - only non-mutant member. Turned into a vampire-like creature by Selene. The Sixth Inner Circle Sebastian Shaw's Inner Circle eventually reemerged. Wolverine came into confrontation with a new \\"Inner Circle\\", under the false impression (by Sebastian Shaw and \\"Miss Sinister\\") that they are behind the kidnapping of his son, Daken.X-Men: Legacy #215 * Sebastian Shaw * Claudine Renko (Miss Sinister) * Mr. Castlemere * Turner * Peter Scholl (Leonine) * Mercedes The Seventh Inner Circle In the event \\"Schism\\", there has apparently been a pro-human coup in the Hellfire Club, all mutant members have been removed, and 12-year-old supergenius Kade Kilgore has been named the new Black King.X-Men: Schism #1 Kilgore then called together a cabal of prepubescent geniuses to secretly rule the Hellfire Club and eradicate mutantkind, then proceeding to poison the other remaining Hellfire Club members, making them the sole leadership.X-Men: Schism #3X-Men: Schism #5 Kade Kilgore later had a change of heart and began recruiting mutants to his side to train the newly manifested mutants at the Hellfire Academy.Wolverine and the X-Men #20 The Hellfire Academy is destroyed by the staff of the Jean Grey School.Wolverine and the X-Men #35 * Kade Kilgore - Black King. A twelve-year-old sociopath who is also the leader of the group. * Doctor Maximilian Frankenstein (formerly Baron Maximilian von Katzenelnbogen) - Black Bishop. Descendant of Victor Frankenstein. He was responsible for creating the Krakoa that the X-Men befriended and the Krakoas that defended the unnamed island where the Hellfire Academy is located.X-Men: Schism #2 * Manuel Enduque - White King. He is well-versed in weaponry with his family reportedly being a dynasty of slavers in Africa with Manuel having strangled his own father to death, thus resulting in him taking control of the business. * Wilhemina Kensington - White Queen. She is an eleven year old with a love of martial arts and beauty pageants who inherited the company after her mother died. She is also both psychopathic and sociopathic, having killed human guards and alien warriors and is also alleged to have mutilated both cats and penguins. ; Associates: * SabretoothWolverine and the X-Men #32 * Ezekiel Stane * Kid Blackheart * Cordelia Frost * Szandor Shaw * Kevin Krask * Kenneth Krask * Wolfgang von Roehm The Eighth Inner Circle Sebastian Shaw has since regained control of the Hellfire Club and in an attempt to restore its former power and glory, decided to ally himself with Magneto and his X-Men branch to form a new Inner Circle. * Sebastian Shaw - Black King * Briar Raleigh - Black Bishop - Magneto's former associate and the only non- mutant within the Inner Circle * Monet St. Croix - White Queen * Black Tom Cassidy - White Bishop The Ninth Inner Circle Eventually Emma Frost decided to rid of Shaw, by spiking his wine with a paralytic agent she made sure there was no way for him to release his body's absorbed energies which overloaded his Mothervine-induced secondary mutation, resulting in his death.X-Men: Black - Emma Frost #1 She then reformed the Inner Circle in her imageUncanny X-Men (Vol. 5) #20 and using Vanisher as her personal transportation, she worked behind the scenes to get the X-Men to handle certain affairs. *Black King: Emma Frost *White King: Mystique *Black Bishop: Elixir *White Bishop: Marrow The Tenth Inner Circle With mutants congregating on Krakoa, Kade Kilgore is able to retake control of the Hellfire Club branch in New York City. Opting later to rename themselves as \\"Homines Verendi\\", a Latin name which roughly translates to \\"man must be revered and feared\\", Kade and his group (Maximilian Frankenstein, Manuel Enduque and Wilhemina Kensington) recruited Taiwanese millionaire and anti-mutant activist, Chen Zhao and stands poised ready to tear down the new age of mutantkind as they are involved in the Krakoans' problems.Marauders #4 With each of the founding members already in possession of massive fortunes, they succeeded in taking over Madripoor, an island in Southeast Asia, and are using it as its base of power. While it is unknown whether or not the royal family of Madripoor has been detained, fled or simply murdered, it's clear that the lawless island is no longer a safe haven for mutants. Once used as a base of operations for the X-Man Wolverine while using the alias ‚ÄúPatch,‚Äù Madripoor has now degenerated into a country that is openly hostile toward mutants and has even gone so far as to offer its citizens payment for killing mutants. It's almost become a dark reflection of Krakoa and everything that it stands for and recruited long-time X-Men foe Donald Pierce to act as Madripoor‚Äôs official representative to the United Nations.Marauders #5 They also secretly aid Hellfire Club member Sebastian Shaw in the murder of Kitty Pryde. Shaw paid Verendi to participate in his scheme to get Kitty alone on Verendi's ship so that he could ensnare her in Krakoan vines and sink her with the ship.Marauders #6 =Members= The following characters are members of the Hellfire Club, many of them being extremely influential, but were not part of any of the Inner Circle incarnations mentioned above.

A few have been named: * Wade ColeUncanny X-Men #133 * Angelo Macon * Murray Reese * Samuel Guthrie (Cannonball) * Richard SalmonsUncanny X-Men #210 * Randall ChaseFirestar #1-4 * Chet AndrewsX-Men Unlimited (vol. 1) #33 Cole, Macon and Reese were savagely wounded by Wolverine in the Hellfire Club's first confrontation with the X-Men. They would return to duty as cyborgsUncanny X-Men #152 before leaving the Club to join Lady Deathstrike in seeking revenge against Wolverine,Uncanny X-Men #205 eventually joining the Reavers.Uncanny X-Men #247 Sam Guthrie worked as a Hellfire guard for a brief period before joining the New Mutants as Cannonball. Kade Kilgore also recruited two survivors of private military company Blackguard, who were augmented with adamantium skeletons, and laser claws as his personal bodyguards.Wolverine and the X-Men #16 The Hellfire Club also employs a number of servants, escorts and strippers. Sharon Kelly was a waitress at the New York branch who was chosen by Sebastian Shaw to seduce Senator Robert Kelly.Uncanny X-Men #246 The couple quickly married, but soon afterwards Sharon was killed in a battle involving the X-Men, further fueling her husband's hatred for mutants. =Massachusetts Academy= The Hellfire Club was aligned with the prestigious prep school the Massachusetts Academy, run by White Queen Emma Frost, for a number of years.Uncanny X-Men #129 In addition to its large, traditional, student body, the Academy secretly trained a team of young mutants known as the Hellions.New Mutants (Vol. 1) #16 Due to their affiliation with the Club, the Hellions were often present at its social functions. This group would entertain a rivalry with Professor Charles Xavier's students at the time, the New Mutants. After the death of the Hellions in an attack orchestrated by the Upstarts, Emma Frost left the Hellfire Club. Re-aligning herself with Professor Xavier, the Massachusetts Academy became the new site for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and a new class, known as Generation X.Uncanny X-Men #318Generation X #1 =Hellfire Academy= The seventh incarnation of the Hellfire Club have since founded the Hellfire Academy, a rival to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. It is located on an unnamed island. According to Kade Kilgore, the purpose of recruiting newly empowered mutants is to train them to be supervillains so he can then profit from the fear generated by them through his Sentinel program.Wolverine and the X-Men vol. 1 #31 Staff outside the Hellfire Club's leadership include: * Mystique - Headmistress who also teaches Intro to Evil.

Sailing out of Hellfire Bay, its ships the Marauder, the Upstart and the Mercury perform public delivery of mutant goods, while also smuggling the drugs illicitly and freeing mutants from unfriendly nations. The company is run by a new Inner Circle which is compose of a triple dynasty of black, white and red Hellfire royalty.Marauders #2 * Black King: Sebastian Shaw * White Queen: Emma Frost * Red Queen: Katherine Pryde * Black Bishop: Shinobi Shaw * White Bishop: Christian Frost * Red Bishop: Lucas Bishop * Black Knight: Andrea and Andreas Fenris * White Knight: Callisto Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the alternate universe known as the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\", the Hellfire Club was not active and was possibly decimated by the forces of Apocalypse. Its closest counterpart was Heaven, Warren Worthington III's nightclub that formed a neutral zone from the genetic conflict that boiled outside. Sebastian Shaw meanwhile served as a member of Apocalypse's court. Donald Pierce also became a servant of Apocalypse, and lead the techno-organic-infected Reavers. On the other side of the conflict, Emma Frost served as part of the Human High Council, having been stripped of her powers through a lobotomy. Jason Wyngarde, a victim of the Sugar Man's genetic experiments, had become one of Forge's Outcasts. After the ascension of Weapon X, Sebastian Shaw remade Heaven into his image and renamed the nightclub as Hellfire Club all the while trying to gain power.Age of Apocalypse #3 =Days of Future Past= In the Days of Future Past timeline, Shinobi Shaw and Betsy Braddock took over the Hellfire Club London Branch and became the Black King and Red Queen. =Bishop's Future= The Hellfire Club retained its position as one of the world's major powers in the future timeline of Bishop. The Club is ruled by Anthony Shaw, a descendant of Sebastian Shaw; he also has an illegitimate son, Trevor Fitzroy. (Fitzroy would later travel back in time, bringing him into conflict with his forefathers Shinobi and Sebastian Shaw.) Malcolm, a colleague of Bishop and member of the Xavier Security Enforcers (X.S.E.), was also a member of the Club. =Clan Hellfire= In a future dominated by Trevor Fitzroy, calling himself The Chronomancer, one of the forces opposing his rule is Clan Hellfire, led by a Samara Shaw. =X-Men: Ronin= In one alternate reality in which the X-Men are based in Japan, the Hellfire Club is ruled by Professor Xavier. The White Queen Emma Frost is a junior member who, along with Tessa, believe Xavier to be their biological father. The Club controls the Shadowcat Clan of ninjas, which includes Pyro, Iceman and Colossus. =Marvel Noir= In X-Men Noir, the Hellfire Club is an exclusive S&M; club owned by Sebastian Shaw, and is plundered early on by Beast, Cyclops and Iceman.X-Men: Noir #2 =Ultimate Marvel= Within the Hellfire Club of the Ultimate Marvel Universe is an Inner Circle led by Sebastian Shaw (with other notable members being Xavier spy Gerald Lavine, and Shaw's son Shinobi) who worship a pagan \\"Phoenix God\\". Believing the Phoenix to be incarnated in the body of X-Man Jean Grey, the Club quietly funded Professor Charles Xavier as she developed under his tutelage. Jean however underwent a mental breakdown, and stole the Inner Circle's bank access codes and wiped their minds.Ultimate X-Men #24 A group called the Church of Shi'ar Enlightenment later approached the Xavier Institute, claiming the Hellfire Club was a breakaway sect, and asking to examine whether or not Jean really is the Phoenix God. However, Lilandra's assistant Gerald Lavine was revealed to be an operative of the Hellfire Club and working for Shinobi Shaw, who is also dating Emma Frost, headmistress of the Academy of Tomorrow and secretly a member of the Hellfire Club. In other media =Television= * Emma Frost, as the White Queen, is a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in the one off animated episode Pryde of the X-Men in 1989. It was planned to be a series, but was cancelled, with only the pilot being produced. She is seen freeing Magneto from a military convoy at the beginning of the episode and can later be seen fighting against Cyclops on Asteroid M. * The original Inner Circle appeared in X-Men under the name of the \\"Inner Circle Club\\" to prevent any controversy regarding the use of the word \\"Hellfire\\". They appear first in cameos in the episode \\"The Phoenix Saga - Part IV\\". The members of the Inner Circle are Sebastian Shaw, Jason Wyngarde, Emma Frost, Donald Pierce, and Harry Leland. They aimed to control Jean Grey and brainwash her into joining them, but unwittingly unleashed the Dark Phoenix. At the end of the saga Shaw, Pierce, and Frost escape, Wyngarde is left catatonic, and Leland is missing following a fight with Wolverine. * The animated series Wolverine and the X-Men featured the Inner Circle composed of Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw, Harry Leland, Donald Pierce, Selene, and the Stepford Cuckoos. This Inner Circle appears more closely related to the Ultimate Marvel series, as a group who is obsessed solely with attaining the power of the Phoenix. In the episode \\"Shades of Grey,\\" Emma Frost telepathically puts the X-Men to sleep so that the Hellfire Club can abduct Jean Grey. In the three-part episode \\"Foresight,\\" Sebastian Shaw, Harry Leland, Donald Pierce, and Selene prepare a ritual that would extract the Phoenix Force from Jean Grey and place it in the Stepford Cuckoos. Emma Frost warned them against the plan, but her warnings fell on deaf ears. When the Phoenix was released, the ceiling fell on top of Leland and Pierce. Emma Frost used her telepathy to subdue Shaw and Selene. * The Hellfire Club (once again under the name Inner Circle) were featured in Marvel Anime: X-Men. In the first episode, they were seen trying to manipulate Jean Grey into using the Phoenix Force for their own use until Jean Grey sacrifices herself. This show also includes some Inner Circle mutants named Rat, Marsh, and Neuron (the Inner Circle's White Bishop) who assisted Mastermind in his plans to rule humanity. * A live action television series titled Hellfire was under development by 20th Century Fox Television and Marvel Television with an early 2017 air date, but on July 12, 2016, Variety reports that the project is no longer moving forward. * Hellfire Club appears in The Gifted television series. In the first season Stepford Cuckoos are revealed to be working for the Hellfire Club, convincing several characters to join them in the season finale. In the second season Reeva Payge takes control of the Inner Circle and pursues a goal of mutant liberation. Other members include Andy Strucker, Polaris (Lorna Dane), Fade and Sage, all of whom joined the Hellfire Club at the end of Season 1 after losing faith in the Mutant Underground. =Film= * The Hellfire Club appeared in the film X-Men: First Class as the main antagonists.Knowles, Harry (August 20, 2010). \\"So Bryan Singer just called regarding Matthew Vaughn's X-MEN: FIRST CLASS... I'm quite excited now.\\" Ain't It Cool News The Hellfire Club is led by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Emma Frost (January Jones), with Azazel (Jason Flemyng), Riptide (√Ålex Gonz√°lez), and Angel Salvadore (Zo√´ Kravitz) as the main members (Although Angel was initially a member of the X-Men before she defected). Their overall goal is to start World War III in order to wipe out the human race from Earth, allowing the mutants to rise up and take over as the survivor race, with Shaw as the leader of the new world order. To this end, they manipulate American and Soviet government officials to instigate the Cuban Missile Crisis, prompting CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to supervise the initial formation of the X-Men, coordinated by Charles Xavier, his adoptive sister Raven, new ally Erik Lensherr, and CIA scientist Hank McCoy, to oppose them. At the end of the movie, Sebastian Shaw is killed by Magneto while many of its members (Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, Angel and Raven) join Magneto and his new group the Brotherhood of Mutants. * The Hellfire Club were originally planned to return in X-Men: Dark Phoenix with a comics-accurate lineup consisting of Harry Leland, Freidrich Von Roehm, the Strucker Twins, Shinobi Shaw, a returning Emma Frost and the Red Lotus Gang though they were cut from the film. =Video games= * Emma Frost was a boss character in the X-Men arcade game by Konami in 1992, loosely based on the \\"Pryde of the X-Men\\" pilot. * The Hellfire Club have appeared in numerous X-Men video games as villains in various stages specifically within the Hellfire Mansion with the final boss almost always being Sebastian Shaw. The Hellfire Club Mansion appeared as the first stage in X-Men (Game Gear System) as well as X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy (Game Gear). Another game they appeared in was X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse. * The Hellfire Club appears as antagonist in the video game Wolverine: Adamantium Rage, for the SNES and Sega Genesis, with Selene and Shinobi Shaw appearing as bosses in their stage. * The Hellfire Club appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. In the Spec Ops part of the game, Emma Frost tells Nick Fury and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent that someone is claiming her former title as White Queen. Their foot soldiers consist of Hellfire Elites, Hellfire Gunners, Hellfire Heavies, Hellfire Hunters, Hellfire Officers, and Hellfire Snipers. The Hellfire Club has also received help in their goals from Avalanche, Blob, Crimson Dynamo (who built the Sentinels that obey the Hellfire Club's every commands), Juggernaut, and Omega Sentinel. In the 6th Spec Ops mission, the Hellfire Club brings Living Pharaoh out of stasis and plots to help him transform into Living Monolith. This time, the Hellfire Club have also enlisted the help of Bullseye, Constrictor, and Dragoness. Also the Hellfire Club is a major antagonist in the first chapter of the second season, with Selene making her first appearance, as a boss in the mission 5. Special Operations 19: Fratricide follows the storyline of the remnants of the Brotherhood being hunted down by Mr. Sinister, Bastion, and the Hellfire Club. Sebastian Shaw appears as the Boss of Mission 3, which also marks his first appearance in the game.

The original Hatsukaze was a license-built Hirth HM 504. Hatsukazi engines were air-cooled, four-cylinder, inverted inline engines developing around 82 kW (110 hp).Francillon p. 505. Design and development Hatsukaze engines were produced in very large numbers, as the powerplant for the license-built B√ºcker B√º 131 Jungmann variants that were the standard primary trainers for the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army. The naval version of the engine was designated GK4, the army version as Ha47. The Hatsukaze Model 12 was the power section linked to a compressor to create a primitive jet engine called a motorjet; the resulting Ishikawajima Tsu-11 was intended to power Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka Model 22 flying bombs. The standard Hatsukaze Model 11 engine was modified at a Navy arsenal by replacing the propeller drive shaft and engine front crankcase cover with a step-up gearbox. The gearbox increased engine output shaft RPM at a 1:3 ratio. At engine speed of 3,000 rpm, the compressor section was operating at 9,000 rpm. The compressed air was then ducted into a combustion chamber where a liquid fuel was sprayed and burnt. The heated compressed air then exits through the tailpipe providing static thrust of 180 kg (396 lb). It is likely that about 1/3 of the total thrust was contributed by adding the combustion chamber aft of the compressor. The Tsu-11 was also selected to power the Yokosuka MXY9 Shuka (\\"Autumn Fire\\"), a trainer intended to prepare pilots for the Mitsubishi J8M rocket-powered interceptor. Neither of these aircraft entered service, however, as their development took place too late in the war.

Since the Mexican Constitution of 1917 forbade re-election of a serving president, incumbent President Plutarco El√≠as Calles could not formally retain the presidency. Portes Gil replaced him, but Calles, the \\"Jefe M√°ximo\\", retained effective political power during what is known as the Maximato. Early life and education Portes Gil was born in Ciudad Victoria, the capital of the state of Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico.\\"Emilio Portes Gil\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2009. Although his grandfather had been a prominent politician in Tamaulipas, Portes Gil's father died when Emilio was young. He lived with his widowed mother lived in straitened circumstances, but a state grant helped Portes Gil receive certification as a schoolteacher. He sought to study law.Ankerson, Dudley. \\"Emilio Portes Gil\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1173. Early career He was in law school during the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution and in late 1914, he allied himself with \\"First Chief\\" Venustiano Carranza, head of the Constitutionalist faction, who would assume the presidency of the country the following May. When Portes Gil graduated from law school in 1915, he had already begun his career in the public administration with a posting in the Constitutionalist faction's Department of Military Justice.Casteel, Cari. \\"Portes Gil, Emilio\\". The Historical Text Archive. Portes Gil became part of the Northern leadership of the Constitutionalist Army, particularly √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, who had defeated Pancho Villa's forces and eliminated them as a political or military factor in Mexico after 1915. Key to his subsequent political career was Sonoran general Plutarco El√≠as Calles.Ankerson, \\"Emilio Portes Gil\\", p. 1173. Portes Gil demonstrated skills as a lawyer and administrator, which catapulted him into the presidency of Mexico when Obreg√≥n was assassinated in 1928. Over the ensuing years, he continued to serve the government in both a legal capacity ‚Äì(supreme state court judge in Sonora; legal advisor to the Ministry of War) and in elective office: he was elected to Congress in 1917, 1921, and 1923, and he served as governor of his native Tamaulipas on two occasions (1920 and 1925). Presidency Emilio Portes Gil, President of Mexico. Between August 28 and November 30, 1928, he was Minister of the Interior (Gobernaci√≥n) in the cabinet of Plutarco El√≠as Calles. When president-elect √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n was assassinated on July 17, 1928 by a Catholic opponent, a political solution to the crisis that did not include Calles returning to the presidency was necessary. Portes Gil, with the agreement of Calles, assumed office as interim president for a period of 14 months, when fresh elections were called. Portes Gil inherited a widespread religious rebellion, the Cristero War, which Calles had provoked by aggressively enforcing anticlerical laws.Tuck, Jim. \\"THE CRISTERO REBELLION ‚Äì PART 1\\", Mexico Connect, 1996. As president, Portes Gil secretly negotiated the end to the conflict between the Catholic Church and the Mexican government, which created a modus vivendi that lasted decades.Roderic Ai Camp, \\"Emilio Portes Gil\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 4, p. 445. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He had reassured the Catholic Church that its officials could petition congress to amend laws that it found to be offensive and that the government would not interfere with its internal operations. The government also granted a general amnesty to Cristero fighters.David Espinosa, Jesuit Student Groups, the Universidad Iberoamericana, & Political Resistance in Mexico, 1913-1979. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2014, pp.46-47. Faced with a university strike, he defused the situation by convening a special session of Congress, which ultimately enacted the legislation granting autonomy to the National University of Mexico.Mabry, Donald J. \\"UNAM Student Strikes, 1929‚Äì1968\\". The Historical Text Archive, 2001. His settling the strike is one of the acts for which he is best remembered as president.Camp, \\"Emilio Portes Gil\\"Dulles, John W.F.

He also attempted to negotiate the withdrawal of the United States troops from Nicaragua, in exchange for the surrender of Nicaraguan General Augusto Sandino. When the talks failed, he granted Sandino political asylum in Mexico and a parcel of land in Temixco.Buchenau, J√ºrgen. In the shadow of the giant: the making of Mexico's Central America policy, 1876‚Äì1930. University of Alabama Press. Tuscaloosa, 1996. Pages 178‚Äì180. Portes Gil attempted to steer government officials away from self-enrichment during their terms of office. He wanted his office-holders to \\"know how to be loyal to institutions, and like the country want the triumph of the Revolution.\\"Olsen, Patrice Elizabeth, Artifacts of Revolution: Architecture, Society, and Politics in Mexico City, 1920-1940. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers 2008, p. 49. His administration embarked on public works projects building schools, hospitals, and housing for the benefit of ordinary Mexicans. In Mexico City, a new hospital for tuberculosis patients was inaugurated; the physical plant of the National Preparatory School, housed in the colonial-era Colegio de San Ildefonso, was expanded; a major sports center open to all, built on a former city dump; and new police and fire stations built in Art Deco design.Olsen, Artifacts of Revolution, pp. 48-54. Later life He handed on the presidential sash to Pascual Ortiz Rubio on February 5, 1930, but effective power still remained in the hands of Calles. Portes Gil later served for 18 months as interior minister. He subsequently traveled to Europe as Mexico's first representative to the League of Nations. Under later presidents, he served in various capacities, including ambassador to India, foreign minister, attorney-general, and president of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Party). In 1933, L√°zaro C√°rdenas was chosen as the party's official candidate for the 1934 presidential elections. Calles attempted to retain his own power as he had endeavored to do throughout the Maximato, but C√°rdenas outmaneuvered Calles politically and eventually exiled him from Mexico. C√°rdenas put Portes Gil in charge of purging the party of Callista elements. Since Portes Gil was \\"one of the 'puppet presidents' so unceremoniously dumped by Calles, [Portes Gil] was happy to serve.\\"Cline, Howard F. The United States and Mexico, Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1961, p. 221. C√°rdenas reorganized the party as the Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Mexicana (PRM), setting the structural form of sectoral representation that its 1946 successor retained, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). C√°rdenas, however, returned Portes Gil to his stronghold in Tamaulipas once the former president had performed his task since the latter had \\"attempted to build up his own position for a possible political comeback.\\"Cline, United States and Mexico, p. 221.

The script was written by Gordon Wellesley and J. B. Priestley. Considered by many to be British music hall star Gracie Fields' finest vehicle, this film was written for her by leading novelist J.B. Priestley. In this morale-boosting depression movie, set in the industrial north of England, Fields stars as a resourceful, determined working class heroine, laid off from her job in a clothing mill, who has to seek work in the seaside resort of Blackpool. This gives her the opportunity both to fall into many misadventures and, of course, to sing. The decision to film on location brings the film a life and immediacy all too absent from most films of the period. The film provides us with a snapshot of life in a seaside resort in the 1930s. The final scene of the millworkers returning to the re-opened mill while Fields leads them in the rousing title song has become an almost iconic film clich√©.

The Exocet saw its first wartime launch during the Falklands War. Etymology The missile's name was given by M. Guillot, then the technical director at Nord Aviation. It is the French word for flying fish, from the Latin exocoetus, a transliteration of the Greek name for the fish that sometimes flew into a boat: (ex≈çkoitos), literally \\"lying down outside (, ), sleeping outside\\". Exocet missile launch Exocet impact Description The Exocet is built by MBDA, a European missile company. Development began in 1967 by Nord as a ship-launched weapon named the MM 38. A few years later Aerospatiale and Nord merged. The basic body design was based on the Nord AS30 air-to-ground tactical missile. The air-launched Exocet was developed in 1974 and entered service with the French Navy five years later. The relatively compact missile is designed for attacking small- to medium-size warships (e.g., frigates, corvettes and destroyers), although multiple hits are effective against larger vessels, such as aircraft carriers. In a recent study by the Russians on the effects of missile boat anti-ship missiles it took three hits to destroy a light cruiser and one to two hits for a destroyer or frigate. Russian missile boat anti-ship missiles have far larger warheads than the Exocet. It is guided inertially in mid-flight and turns on active radar late in its flight to find and hit its target. As a countermeasure against air defence around the target, it maintains a very low altitude during ingress, staying one to two meters above the sea surface. Due to the effect of the radar horizon, this means that the target may not detect an incoming attack until the missile is only 6,000 m from impact. This leaves little time for reaction and stimulated the design of close-in weapon systems (CIWS). Its rocket motor, which is fuelled by solid propellant, gives the Exocet a maximum range of . It was replaced on the Block 3 MM40 ship-launched version of the missile with a solid-propellant booster and a turbojet sustainer motor which extends the range of the missile to more than . The submarine-launched version places the missile inside a launch capsule. =Versions= The Exocet has been manufactured in versions including: * MM38 (surface-launched) ‚Äì deployed on warships. Range: 42 km. No longer produced (1970). A coast defence version known as \\"Excalibur\\" was developed in the United Kingdom and deployed in Gibraltar from 1985 to 1997. * AM38 (helicopter-launched ‚Äì tested only)Based on the ship launched MM38. Only five tested in 1973 from a Super-Felon helicopter, further development then abandoned for the lighter and smaller AM39. ‚Äì * AM39 (air-launched) ‚Äì B2 Mod 2: deployed on 14 types of aircraft (combat jets, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters). Range between 50 and 70 km, depending on the altitude and the speed of the launch aircraft. * SM39 (submarine-launched) ‚Äì B2 Mod 2: deployed on submarines. The missile is housed inside a watertight launched capsule (VSM or v√©hicule Sous marin), which is fired by the submarine's torpedo-launch tubes. On leaving the water, the capsule is ejected and the missile's motor is ignited. It then behaves like an MM40. The missile will be fired at depth, which makes it particularly suitable for discreet submarine operations. * MM40 (surface-launched) ‚Äì Block 1, Block 2 and Block 3: deployed on warships and in coastal batteries. Range: 72 km for the Block 2, in excess of 180 km for the Block3. =MM40 Block 3= In February 2004, the D√©l√©gation G√©n√©rale pour l'Armement (DGA) notified MBDA of a contract for the design and production of a new missile, the MM40 Block 3. It has an improved range, in excess of ‚Äîthrough the use of a turbojet engine, and includes four air intakes to provide continuous airflow to the power plant during high-G manoeuvres. The Block 3 missile accepts GPS guidance system waypoint commands, which allow it to attack naval targets from different angles and to strike land targets, giving it a marginal role as a land-attack missile. The Block 3 Exocet is lighter than the previous MM40 Block 2 Exocet. 45 Block 3 Exocets were ordered by the French Navy in December 2008 for its ships which were carrying Block 2 missiles, namely Horizon-class and Aquitaine-class frigates. These are not to be new productions but the conversion of older Block 2 missiles to the Block 3 standard. An MM40 Block 3 last qualification firing took place on the √éle du Levant test range on 25 April 2007 and series manufacturing began in October 2008. The first firing of the Block 3 from a warship took place on 18 March 2010, from the French Navy air defence frigate . In 2012, a new motor, designed and manufactured in Brazil by the Avibras company in collaboration with MBDA, was tested on an MM40 missile of the Brazilian Navy. Beside the French, the Block 3 has been ordered by several other navies including that of Greece, the UAE, Chile, Peru, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia and Morocco. The chief competitors to the Exocet are the US-made Harpoon, the Italian Otomat, the Swedish RBS-15 and the Chinese Yingji series. Operational history =Falklands War= Super √âtendard) of Argentina's 2nd Navy Squadron, used in the Atlantic Conveyor attack In 1982, during the Falklands War, Argentine Navy Dassault-Breguet Super √âtendard warplanes carrying the AM39 Air-launched version of the Exocet caused damage which sank the Royal Navy destroyer on 4 May 1982. Two more Exocets struck the 15,000-ton merchant ship on 25 May. Two MM38 ship-to-ship missiles were removed from the destroyer ARA Segu√≠, a former US Navy destroyer, and transferred to an improvised launcher for land use. The missiles were launched on 12 June 1982 and one hit the destroyer . ;HMS Sheffield Sheffield was a Type 42 guided missile destroyer commissioned in 1975. On 4 May 1982, Sheffield was at defence watches (second-degree readiness) the southernmost of three Type 42 destroyers when she was hit by one of two AM39 Air-launched Exocet missiles fired by Argentine Super √âtendard strike fighters. The second missile splashed into the sea about half-mile off her port beam.Narrative of the attack , page 6 The missile that struck Sheffield impacted on the starboard side at deck level 2, travelling through the junior ratings' scullery and breaching the Forward Auxiliary Machinery Room/Forward Engine Room bulkhead above the waterline, creating a hole in the hull roughly . It appears that the warhead did not explode. 20 members of her complement were killed, 26 injured and the loss of Sheffield was a deep shock to the British public and government. The official Royal Navy Board of Inquiry Report stated that evidence indicates that the warhead did not detonate. During the 4¬Ω days that the ship remained afloat, five salvage inspections were made and a number of photographs were taken. Members of the crew were interviewed and testimony was given by Exocet specialists (the Royal Navy had 15 surface combat ships armed with Exocets in the Falklands War). There was no evidence of an explosion, although burning propellant from the rocket motor caused fires which could not be checked as firefighting equipment had been put out of action. ;SS Atlantic Conveyor Atlantic Conveyor was a 14,950 ton roll- on, roll-off container ship launched in 1969 that had been hastily converted to an aircraft transport and was carrying helicopters and supplies, including cluster bombs.The Atlantic Conveyor - Before She Was Famous Two Exocet missiles had been fired at a frigate, but had been confused by its defences and re-targeted the Atlantic Conveyor. Both missiles struck the container ship on her port quarter and warheads exploded either after penetrating the ship's hull, or on impact. Witness Prince Andrew reported that debris caused \\"splashes in the water about a quarter of a mile away\\". Twelve men were killed and the survivors were taken to HMS Hermes. ;HMS Invincible On 30 May, two Super √âtendards, one carrying Argentina's last remaining Exocet, escorted by four A-4C Skyhawks each with two 500lb bombs, took off to attack the carrier HMS Invincible. Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of HMS Invincible from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands. However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the ship to disguise her position. This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the main body of ships. Two of the attacking Skyhawks were shot down by a Sea Dart fired by HMS Exeter, with HMS Avenger claiming to have shot down the missile with her 4.5\\" gun (although this claim is disputed). No damage was caused to any British vessels. ;HMS Glamorgan HMS Glamorgan was a destroyer of the Royal Navy launched in 1964. On 12 June 1982 an MM38 Exocet missile was fired from an improvised shore-based launcher as she was steaming at about offshore. The first attempt to fire a missile did not result in a launch; on the second attempt, a missile was launched but did not acquire the target. The third attempt resulted in a missile tracking Glamorgan. The incoming Exocet missile was also spotted on Glamorgan and a turn was ordered to present the stern to the missile. The turn prevented the missile from striking the ship's side and penetrating the hull; instead, it hit the deck coaming at an angle, near the port Seacat launcher, skidded along the deck and exploded, making a hole in the hangar deck and a hole in the galley below. The blast travelled forwards and down, and the missile body, still travelling forwards, penetrated the hangar door, causing the ship's fuelled and armed Wessex helicopter (HAS.3 XM837) to explode and start a severe fire in the hangar. Fourteen crew members were killed and more wounded. ;Post Falklands war In the years after the Falklands War, it was revealed that the British government and the Secret Intelligence Service had been extremely concerned at the time by the perceived inadequacy of the Royal Navy's anti-missile defences against the Exocet and its potential to tip the naval war decisively in favour of the Argentine forces. A scenario was envisioned in which one or both of the force's two aircraft carriers ( and ) were destroyed or incapacitated by Exocet attacks, which would make recapturing the Falklands much more difficult. Actions were taken to contain the Exocet threat. A major intelligence operation was initiated to prevent the Argentine Navy from acquiring more of the weapons on the international market. The operation included British intelligence agents claiming to be arms dealers able to supply large numbers of Exocets to Argentina, who diverted Argentina from pursuing sources which could genuinely supply a few missiles. France denied deliveries of Exocet AM39s purchased by Peru to avoid the possibility of Peru giving them to Argentina because they knew that payment would be made with credit from the Central Bank of Peru. British intelligence had detected the guarantee was a deposit of two hundred million dollars from the Andean Lima Bank, an owned subsidiary of the Banco Ambrosiano. =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= Stark listing after being hit. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, on 17 May 1987, an Iraqi aircraft initially identified as a Dassault Mirage F1Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Attack of the USS Stark in 1987 aircraft but was in fact a modified Falcon 50 business jet, fired two Exocet missiles at the American frigate . Both missiles struck the port side of the ship near the bridge. No weapons were fired in defence, the Phalanx CIWS remained in standby mode and the Mark 36 SRBOC countermeasures were not armed. 37 United States Navy personnel were killed and 21 wounded.
