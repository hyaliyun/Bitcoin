The epa picture service is based both on the broad network of epa's staff photographers all over the world and on the daily production of its member agencies, which are all market leaders in their respective countries. All photos are edited and distributed to clients and partners worldwide by the editorial headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which is staffed 24 hours daily.  The epa service  epa built up a reputation for reliable, independent and unique photo coverage. The international picture service of epa is used by diverse media as well as EPA's partners and shareholders worldwide. At present epa‚Äôs editorial service offers approximately 2,000 new images on an average day. The service includes photographs in the areas of news, sports, arts, culture and entertainment, economy, human interest, and science.  The epa archive  The epa photo archive dates back to 1997 and has over six million images on stock, the majority of which can be accessed online.  History  epa was founded in 1985 by seven European news agencies. The agencies, AFP of France, ANP of the Netherlands, ANOP (now Lusa) of Portugal, ANSA of Italy, Belga of Belgium, dpa of Germany and EFE of Spain were motivated by what they saw as a lack of alternatives to the Anglo-Saxon picture services offered at the time. Originally conceived as a vehicle to exchange the pictures of the member agencies‚Äô domestic service; it also included the world service of AFP and other European services and suppliers. It expanded to a more independent entity as Eastern Europe opened up. The opening of these new markets, along with the war in the former Yugoslavia, led epa to employ its own photographers in those regions. Despite these developments, epa remained under the auspices of their member/owners whom it exclusively served. = epa shareholders and epa going global = By 1995 epa had ten members with the additions of Keystone later in 1985, APA of Austria in 1986, and Lehtikuva of Finland in 1987. Pressensbild of Sweden joined in 1997 followed by Scanfoto (later Scanpix Norway) of Norway and Nordfoto (later Scanpix Denmark) of Denmark in 1999. pap of Poland joined epa in 2001. In early 2003 after extensive restructuring and the departure of AFP, epa successfully made its service available to the worldwide market. Later in 2003 Lehtikuva, Scanpix Denmark/Norway and Pressensbild (later Scanpix Sweden) decided not to continue as a shareholder of epa. However, Scanpix Norway, Sweden and Denmark continued cooperation with epa under the name of Scanpix Scandinavia.

Externally it is similar in appearance and design to the Humvee of the United States Military due to similar requirements. More than 2,000 of the vehicles have been delivered to the Spanish Armed Forces. Several other countries operate the VAMTAC as well, and it has seen service most recently in Afghanistan and Syria. The vehicle comes in two models, named I3, S3 and ST5, and has several configurations. Development The URO VAMTAC was developed by the Spanish company URO, Vehiculos Especiales S.A. so that it would meet the requirements of the Spanish military for a multipurpose, air- portable, high mobility off-road vehicle with good payload capacity. Just as the HMMWV entered production in 1984 the Spanish army started to think of purchasing their own multirole vehicle that would replace Land Rovers. VAMTAC concept did not materialize until 1995 when a competition was held for a next- generation tactical vehicle. The American HMMWV was also a natural candidate for several reasons. UROVESA decided to design a vehicle that could exceed the US design. After the vehicle was tested by the Spanish Ministry of Defence, UROVESA received a five-year contract and the URO VAMTAC was produced from 1998 to 2003. In October 2005, the Ministry of Defence awarded a new five-year contract for the URO VAMTAC after a three-month trial period. This also introduced some changes, and the two models of the vehicle which were named T3 and T5, were re-designated as I3 and S3 respectively. The URO VAMTAC is similar in appearance and design to the U.S. Military's Humvee, because both vehicles were designed to meet similar requirements and specifications. Operational history URO VAMTAC of the Spanish National Police Approximately 1,200 units were delivered to the Spanish military under the initial contract from 1998. Roughly 60 percent of these were of the T5 model (later S3), and the rest were T3 (later I3). By late 2009, around 900 more units had been delivered under the second contract, bringing the total procured by Spanish forces to approximately 2,100 vehicles. All the vehicles delivered under the second contract have been of the S3 model. The military has equipped about 25 percent of the vehicles received under the initial contract with ballistic kits, increasing their armour. URO VAMTACs have been used by the Spanish National Police as well. In April 2013, the Vamtac was selected as the chosen vehicle for all branches of the Spanish armed forces. This means they will replace HUMVWVs used by Spanish Marines. A total of 772 vehicles were to be acquired over a 5-year period. The Spanish military has used the URO VAMTAC in Afghanistan, as well in Congo and Lebanon. Several other countries use this vehicle. All in all, according to a 2017 estimate, some 4,500 units are in service in more than 20 countries and so far in 50 different configurations.

The band formed in 1998 and has released four full-length studio albums, one independent release and one live album. History Jaya The Cat was founded in the late 1990s by Geoff Lagadec (vocals/guitar), Dave Smith (guitar/vocals), Hugh Brockmyre (drums) and Ben Murphy (bass/vocals) in Boston, Massachusetts. Their first recording \\"O'Farrell\\" was an independent release that gained much attention and got them their first record deal on Gold Circle Records. Their first major release album Basement Style was recorded at Slaughterhouse studios in Amherst, Massachusetts with studio drummer and longtime friend of Murphy's JJ O'Connell. It was received well among critics and fans and gained attention in the northeast and southwest of the United States, but really began to pick up steam in Europe. After drummer David \\"The Germ\\" Germain (formerly with Shadows Fall) joined the band they began touring the US on the Vans Warped Tour and Europe. In 2001, the band arrived in the Netherlands to play the Lowlands Festival, and in 2003 they recorded a live album, Ernesto‚Äôs Burning. After the release of the second studio album First Beer of a New Day, Dave Smith (guitar) and Ben Murphy (bass) quit the band. Shortly afterwards, Smith and Murphy formed the American rock/punk/country band Ragged Old Flag. The remaining members of Jaya the Cat decided to move to Amsterdam where they teamed up with Jan Jaap \\"Jay\\" Onverwagt (bass, ex-Green Lizard) and Alejandro Londo√±o (guitar, Cultura Tres) to continue their efforts from Europe. In 2005, Brian Tjon Ajong (guitar, also ex-Green Lizard) joined the band to replace Londo√±o. Shortly after, Jordi Nieuwenburg replaced Tjon Ajong on guitar and Onverwagt, who had moved on to play keyboards for the band, was replaced by Steven Brautigam on bass. The band's third album More Late Night Transmissions With... was released on November 16, 2007 by I Scream Records. More Late Night's sound is considerably more laidback compared to their previous releases, drawing more on reggae influences than the previous two albums. More Late Night Transmissions With... was re-issued by Bomber Music in April 2014, on CD and green vinyl. The fourth studio album The New International Sound Of Hedonism was released by Bomber Music in the summer of 2012. After the release of Hedonism, the band was joined by Johan \\"Leon\\" van 't Zand (live keys, ex- Mark Foggo) to complete the live formation. A year later, guitarist Nieuwenburg left the band and was replaced by Dino Memic (ex-Vine Yard). In June 2013, original bassist Ben Murphy rejoined the band on stage in the Netherlands to play a handful of songs from the first two releases as Jay took over duties as party MC. In November 2014, the band announced that van 't Zand left. Karl Smith (ex-Mr Shiraz, ex-Tropical Contact and drummer of Complicated Men Of Leisure) took over his duties on keys at the start of Jaya the Cat's UK tour with the Mad Caddies. Though the lineup has changed numerous times throughout the years, Jaya the Cat manage to remain true to their roots and continue to press on forward. With the departure of Dino Memic in September 2016 Smith moved on to guitar, and Christian Greevink filled his former position on keys for live shows. On November 17th 2017, the band released their fifth studio album A Good Day for the Damned through Bomber Music. It was also announced that their long time friend and former roadie, 'Sexy' Joep Muijres, has taken over live keyboard duties from Greevink indefinitely.

For this diagram, captains are purple and yellow. Bizingo is a two-player strategy board game created sometime in the 1850s in the United States. Two opposing armies on a triangular grid face off against one another. The game seems unrelated to any other, except perhaps to the traditional Zuni game Awithlaknakwe. Setup The board is in the shape of an equilateral triangle with truncated corners. It contains 157 triangular in an alternating color pattern; 75 cells are light-colored, 82 are dark-colored. Each player has 18 pieces in his or her own color: 16 regular pieces and 2 captains. Because the board is triangular, the two armies are set up asymmetrically (see illustration). One player sets his or her pieces near a base of the triangle on light-colored cells in three rows: seven pieces in the front row, six pieces in the middle row, five pieces in the third row; the back row is left empty. The other player sets his or her pieces at the opposite end of the triangle on dark-colored cells in four rows: six pieces in the front row, five pieces in the second row, six pieces in the third row, three pieces in the fourth row; the two back rows are left empty. Each player's two captains are placed in his or her front row, one cell inward from the left and right sides. An empty row separates the armies. Game rules Players decide who moves first. alternate. A player can move only one of his or her pieces per turn. =Objective= A player wins the game by reducing the opponent to two pieces. =Moves= A player can move a piece to any empty adjacent cell of the same color; so, on an open board, six moves are possible. Throughout the game, a player's pieces are restricted to cells of the same color. =Captures= A captured piece is immediately removed from the game. * A player captures a regular enemy piece by surrounding it on three sides (i.e. by the method). * A player captures an enemy captain by surrounding it on three sides, with the caveat that one of the surrounding pieces must be a captain. (Three regular pieces are insufficient and the enemy captain would be unaffected.) * An enemy piece on a row at the edge of the board can be captured by surrounding it on two sides, with the caveat that one of the surrounding pieces must be a captain. (Two regular pieces are insufficient.) * If a piece (regular or captain) is moved to a cell already surrounded by three enemy pieces, it is instantly captured, unless the move itself performed a capture. It is uncertain if more than one enemy piece can be captured in one move.

Kucinich in 1979.\\"Kucinich abandons White House bid\\" , WRAL- TV, January 24, 2008 Kucinich later became a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Biography=Early life= Sinito was born on Woodland Ave in Cuyahoga county, Ohio. His Father was a maternal cousin of the convicted corrupt Cleveland municipal prosecutor, Thomas Longo who represented the Bedford, Highland Hills and Chagrin Falls townships and was a candidate for the Bedford Municipal Judgship in May 1997. Sinito was the nephew of (Giuseppe Antonio Berardinelli) Joey Maxim by marriage, the legendary Italian-American boxer who became the 1952 Lightweight Boxing Champion of the World. Thomas Sinito married Irene B. Mitroff in 1960 and they had two children. In 1990, Irene died in a Lake Erie boating accident. After divorcing Irene, Sinito took a second wife, Kristine, with whom he had a daughter.The encyclopedia of Cleveland history: Thomas Sinito =Early association with the Cleveland family= Thomas Sinito's involvement with the Cleveland family Capo, Angelo \\"Big Ange\\" Lonardo began when he worked as a bartender at Angelo's Highlander Restaurant and Lounge on Northfield Road. Prior to this acquaintance, he had served many years as an errand boy for the mob, tending various vending machine routes. Later, Sinito had several of his own ventures, including part ownership in a Valley Forge, Pennsylvania amusement park. This amusement park provided an ingenious way to launder money undetected, which came from various gambling, drug trafficking and loansharking pursuits, through the amusement park's cash flow. Sinito had a wide assortment of interest and investments in both legitimate as well as illegitimate businesses. Sinito cautiously invested in many illegitimate business holdings, and greatly profited from the investments he made. Locally, he entered the vending machine business with lucrative washer and dryer accounts at numerous apartment buildings. Sinito also ran some coin-operated vending machine routes, from which he derived a significant bulk of his earnings. His business front was a gift basket company, on Chagrin Boulevard, once a favored area for Mob business and socialization. In addition to the gift basket shop Sinito opened in Beachwood, Ohio, he also co-owned the Appliance Mart with his brother Chuck. The Appliance Mart was a business front for the Cleveland family. The mart, which opened in 1972, had two locations, one in Euclid, Ohio and the other in Bedford, Ohio on Northfield Road. The Bedford store soon became a major base of operations for Sinito, from which he regularly met with Lonardo and other mobsters, discussed various illegal activities, short term as well as long term criminal plots, schemes and scams, and operated various illegal activities. Detailed plans for drug trafficking, conspiracies to kill police informers and other violent measures were conceived and acted on from meetings in the back rooms of Appliance Mart. Sinito was a talented extortionist and operated a lucrative loansharking scheme out of Appliance Mart. Appliance Mart would extend credit to customers it knew weren't credit-worthy and then use forceful extortion tactics to make good on the payment. One of the victims of this loansharking scheme included a small-time career criminal named Carmen \\"Jinglebells\\" Zagaria, who would later become a partner with Sinito and manage a major drug trafficking ring. Zagaria owed Sinito a large amount of money, the interest on which, grew larger and larger. Sinito and the other mob leaders controlled Zagaria as a result of the high interest on his loan shark debts.Dicing and Drugs: Carmen Zagaria and Tommy Sinito Part 3 =The nickname= There are many stories on how Sinito acquired the nickname \\"The Chinaman\\". One version said that nickname derived from his eyes, which allegedly look slanted \\"like a Chinaman‚Äôs\\". Another version stated that the nickname described his silent, calm, stoic, disciplined and inscrutable demeanor, the stereotypical qualities of a Chinese man. Another version cited a resemblance to actor David Carradine to the television show Kung Fu, and to a claim that Sinito made karate chops when angry. However, the most popular story was that in either 1973 or 1974 Sinito allegedly threw 10 to 30 people out of a bar on Cleveland's West Side during a brawl.Tommy James Sinito: The Early Years, Part 1 =Cleveland‚Äôs Model Cities scandal= Sinito was a minor figure involved in the 1973 Cleveland's Model Cities scandal. In August 1973, Robert Doggett was the director of the Model City program, which was a federal initiative created under President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs Great Society Program during the 1970s. The program funneled millions of dollars into major cities in an effort to help the poor. Local Cleveland area civic and community groups were to determine how to use these funds. Originally the first planned amount was to be $45 million. A federal audit later undertaken by the GAO showed much of the Federal funds were wasted. The General Accounting Office's audit showed at least as much as $9.2 million were misspent on fraud and waste. A prominent Cleveland mobster and drug trafficker Ronald Bey was hired by then Mayor Ralph J. Perk, into a high level administrative staff position, for the purpose of conducting a drug control feasibility study. An investigation of the corruption and graft in the Model Cities program lead to Mayor Perk‚Äôs administration. Bey worked in Mayor Perk‚Äôs administration, and appeared in several photographs alongside Mayor Perk. In spite of Perk‚Äôs protests that he didn‚Äôt know Bey worked for the City of Cleveland, the photographs of both men decorated city hall. The mob wanted its front companies to receive the biggest contracts. While walking to his office on St. Clair, Doggett was shot in the stomach and nearly died. His would-be assassin was found a few days later, floating facedown in the Ohio River. The shooter's name was Gerald \\"Chick\\" Johnson, a former employee of a shady contractor who was seeking a city contract. Bey became a suspect in the Robert Doggett shooting. Cleveland Police investigators uncovered information, that three days earlier, Doggett had refused to pay Bey's $3,111 fee on his service contract. A Special Grand Jury was convened to Investigate the Model Cities shooting. Its purpose was to investigate Doggett's shooting and how the Model Cities program was administered. Sinito was one of the witnesses subpoenaed to testify. According to Sgt. Edward Kovacic, of the Cleveland Police intelligence unit, Johnson's car was leased from a dealership where Sinito worked. Although Sinito was granted immunity from any charges that might result from this Special Grand Jury's findings, he refused to cooperate, and testify before a grand jury. No individuals, including Bey, were ever indicted from the results of this Special Grand Jury. =Conflict with Danny Greene= In 1975, the legendary Irish-American mobster, Danny Greene began asserting himself in the vending machine racket, which had traditionally been a Mafia racket, and began muscling into many of the Cleveland Mafia's gambling operations. This greatly angered the Cleveland family leadership. According to a mob informant, this move brought him into conflict with Sinito. Sinito considered Greene an extortionist and felt that Greene's coined operated laundry contracts with their excessive fees were nothing more than extortion.Porrello, To Kill the Irishman, pp. 108 Danny Greene controlled some of the more lucrative laundry contracts which Sinito was competing for. Sinito and mob associate, Joseph \\"Joey Loose\\" Iacobacci soon murdered one of Greene's associates. Greene's response was to have one of his gang, possibly his cousin Kevin McTaggart, wire a bundle of dynamite to the frame of Sinito's car. Sinito found the bomb in his car, attached to the frame. He removed the bomb, disarmed it and later destroyed it. This act of war by Greene drew Sinito into the Mafia war with Greene in Cleveland during the 1970s, where he would play a significant role. =Kucinich assassination plot= As the Cleveland family waged its gang war against Danny Greene, newly elected Mayor Dennis J. Kucinich fought hard to sever the Mafia's old ties to local government. In 1977, Kucinich mandated that all city contracts Cleveland had with various companies would be re- evaluated. In an effort to save money for the financially strapped city, he would have these contracts re-bid on, with the contracts going to the lowest bidder. This decision put him at odds with the Cleveland Mob. That same year, Kucinich refused to sell Municipal Light, Cleveland's public power plant, to private interests that stood to financially gain from the purchase. The Cleveland family didn't care whether or not Kucinch sold the Municipal Light system to the highest bidder, its sale didn't affect them. Re-bidding on the city contracts they held through various front companies would, however, adversely affect the Cleveland family's interests. The most coveted deal was the garbage-hauling contract once held by Danny Greene, before an associate of his named James Palladino took it over. Palladino made no secret of his contempt for Kucinich, after the mayor awarded the contract to another businessman not directly connected to organized crime. Some city contracts, especially in garbage hauling, had been under total mob control since the late 1940s. When Kucinich announced in both daily papers, the Plain Dealer and the now defunct Cleveland Press, that he planned to review all city held contracts and open them to the lowest outside bids, it greatly infuriated the Cleveland family hierarchy. Kucinich also began reviewing all of the garbage hauling contracts after coming to office. Every mob-held front company having any city contracts were to be investigated and criminal charges brought against the racketeers. This meant being convicted on federal racketeering charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, with its stiff penalties, such as long jail sentences. These aforementioned reasons propelled mob boss, James Licavoli, with the advice of Lonardo to order a hit on Kucinich in 1978. In face of some opposition by lower level associates, Sinito stubbornly defended Licavoli's decision and it was then decided to use the services of an outsider professional hitman, since using local associates for the job could trace back to them. Sinito's uncle Joey Maxim, who worked in an Atlantic City casino helped him contact a contract killer. However, the supposed killer was, in fact, an undercover Maryland State Police officer using the name Gene, who specialized in posing as a contract killer. The two met in the Atlantic City casino where Maxim worked. Gene walked into the casino's lounge where he'd been told to meet Sinito. During the meeting, Sinito introduced himself only as Tommy and successfully hired Gene for the Assassination plot. Gene was initially paid $25,000 for his services. After the meeting, Gene informed Cleveland Police who soon made a connection to Sinito, after checking police records. Several bizarre plans were discussed. One was to kill Kucinich as he left Tony's Diner on West 117th and Lorain Avenue. Gene would perch on an outside steel fire escape across the street, armed with a sniper rifle and shoot Kucinich when he came out of the diner. A second plan was to shoot Kucinich as he marched down Euclid Avenue in the 1979 Columbus Day Parade. But the hit didn't happen because an ulcer inside Kunicich's stomach burst before the event, and the mayor was rushed to the hospital. The assassination plot continued for three long years, but never came to fruition. When Cleveland Trust called in long-standing debts in retaliation for Kucinich's refusal not to sell Municipal Light, the city went into default and Kucinich's popularity plummeted. The hit was eventually called off when Kucinich did not win reelection in 1979. Gene returned to Maryland. In 1984, the Kucinich plot would result in a probe into the Cleveland Mafia's part in the assassination plot. The plot to kill Kucinich was not made public until 1984. Even Kucinich had been kept in the dark. In the past, Kucinich has implied he believes it was divine intervention that kept him from the parade that day. =Made man= Due to his business savvy and tremendous money-earning abilities, Sinito soon acquired a reputation as an earner and gained a high level of trust in the Cleveland Family. His refusal to testify in the Model Cities scandal, as well as his active role in the Mafia's war with Danny Greene helped to cement this solid reputation within the family. Like many of the old time mafioso, he was very cautious in his dealings with others and extremely low profile. These factors caused him to slip away unknown and undetected from the attention of local law enforcement for a short period of time. Unlike many of his fellow mobsters such as Carmen Zagaria, Kevin McTaggart and the Graewe brothers, Sinito was not a psychopath. Ever the diplomat, Sinito always preferred to primarily use reason rather than violence, when dealing with a problem. He saw murder only as a means of preventing treachery and protecting their interests and profits from their criminal enterprises. However, Sinito would never shy away from using violence or committing a murder to protect his or the family's interest, when the situation deemed it necessary. He was strictly Machiavellian in his decisions, using and manipulating others as he saw fit. During the 1970s, Sinito became a regular at Jackie Presser‚Äôs restaurant \\"The Forge\\". These frequent visits to this notorious mob hangout brought him under Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surveillance. Throughout this period, Sinito and his mob cohorts never realized that Presser, along with his business partner, Tony Hughes, were FBI informants. Presser had been feeding information to the FBI about Mafia activities since 1968. When Lonardo was promoted to underboss in 1976, Sinito was given control over Lonardo's crew. Upon his promotion, Sinito also received a share of the profits which were regularly being skimmed from the Stardust, Fremont, and Desert Inn casinos in Las Vegas by the Chicago Outfit and the various mid-western Mafia families. The Cleveland family received a total of about $40,000 a month from the skim. In the midst of the Mafia's war with Greene, Licavoli gained permission from Anthony Salerno, head of the Genovese crime family, to initiate ten new official members, including Thomas Sinito in 1977. In 1979, Sinito together with his mob colleague, Joseph Gallo, was eventually made into the Cleveland family. The induction ceremony took place in a small private back room at the Italian-American brotherhood Club in Cleveland's Murray Hill district, on Mayfield Road. The sacred Mafia vow of Omerta was administered to the duo by the Underboss, Angelo \\"Big Ange\\" Lonardo. Also present in the ceremony was mob boss, James T. Licavoli, and Charlie Casra, a retired member of the Cleveland Family. =Involvement in the Zagaria drug trafficking network= After the assassination of Greene, Sinito became heavily involved in the drug trade. The underworld war with Greene and his subsequent assassination resulted in a massive federal crackdown that proved to be very costly and disastrous for the Cleveland family. Many high ranking mobsters were incarcerated and convicted for crimes related to the war, and the Cleveland family was losing a lot of money and potential profits due to these incidents. Determined to recover most of the profits lost, the Cleveland family soon turned to the previously taboo rackets of Narcotics trafficking. In spite of the official \\"no drugs\\" policy, Sinito engaged in drug trafficking for the family, and did so with the tacit approval of the imprisoned mob boss, James Licavoli. However, Licavoli's underboss, Angelo Lonardo, was totally opposed to drug dealing and unsuccessfully tried to steer Licavoli against it.Porello, Kill the Irishman, pp. 175 During this period, the Cleveland family was involved in a large-scale narcotics network that distributed and sold marijuana, cocaine, quaaludes, and other controlled substances. The narcotics network was overseen by Cleveland mobster, Carmen P. Zagaria, who was controlled in the operation by Sinito and another Capo, Joseph Charles Gallo. In spite of his Italian-American heritage and deep involvement in business dealings with the Cleveland family, Zagaria refused Gallo's offer to be \\"made\\" into the family, with the rank of a Caporegime. It is estimated that in 1981 alone, Zagaria's drug network brought in approximately $15 million and was considered the largest narcotics network in northeast Ohio.RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS FROM THE CLEVELAND DIVISION OF THE FBI Years later, while testifying in front of the US Senate, Lonardo testified that Sinito was running a major narcotics trafficking network for the Cleveland family in the late seventies. The profits were delivered up to Licavoli, with Sinito taking a cut. He also stated that, at that time, Sinito was known for organizing hits on anyone who crossed him, not only other drug dealers stepping on his turf, but friends, too.The Mafia Plot To Kill Dennis Kucinich The massive drug ring operation created by the merger of the smaller drug rings in the 1970s continued to operate and generate profit for the mob. It operated until the FBI arrested and got convictions to imprison the drug kingpins running it. Cocaine, marijuana, repackaged illegally obtained prescription drugs, hashish, LSD, PCP and heroin were sold through Zagaria's ring. Drug mules made regular deliveries of raw drugs to safe stash houses in Cleveland. The raw drugs would then be processed for street sales. Zagaria recruited new street level workers to keep the drug operation running, money counting, distribution, mules, processing raw drugs for sale and selling the drugs. Some of these new recruits, Keith Ritson and Greene's cousin, Kevin McTaggart, were former members of the Celtic Club. The Gallo, Sinito and Zagaria drug operation flourished, a triumph for all of its managers. The Zagaria, Gallo and Sinito drug ring accounted for 40% of illegal drug sales in Cuyahoga County. The drug ring's activities drew the attention of the FBI and it began a two-year investigation of the drug ring's activities.Thomas Sinito: The Mafia Years Part 2 After becoming the focus of an FBI investigation codenamed \\"Operation Busmark\\", Carmen Zagaria was convicted in state court of selling drugs, and sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison. He became a fugitive while out on bail, but gave himself up to the FBI at Holy Cross Cemetery on September 23, 1982. Facing the original conviction and sentence, additional federal drug charges, weapons charges, and potential indictments against his family members, Zagaria became a government witness and admitted to leading a drug enterprise and over 19 murders committed by the network. With his near photographic memory, Zagaria's testimony would prove incriminating and quite damaging to his former crime associates. He would go on to testify against Sinito, Angelo Lonardo, Hans Graewe, Joseph C. Gallo and Kevin McTaggart for vast narcotics dealings and the 19 murders.Porello, Kill the Irishman, pp. 195 =The Perrier and Bonarigo murders= Sinito was involved in the murder of a Cleveland gangster named Joseph Bonarigo. After supposedly hearing of a murder threat against the Cleveland family hierarchy from Bonarigo, Sinito went to Licavoli and Lonardo and informed them of the threat. Sinito was then given permission to contract for Bonarigo's murder, which was given to Joe Iacobacci. Iacobacci used the help of a Hell's Angels member in the murder of Joe Bonarigo. However, after finding out that Sinito was in the dope business with Zagaria, Lonardo assumed that Sinito wanted Bonarigo out of the way for his dope business, and not because of any real threat to them. David Perrier had been a collector of loanshark debts for Sinito. Perrier had a drug problem and would get drunk and get into fights at the local bars. Sinito had told Lonardo that he was worried about Perrier, as he thought Perrier had already talked to law enforcement about Sinito's illegal activities. One time, Perrier created a scene at a bar in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, when he made statements against Licavoli and slapped Licavoli's friend, Steve \\"Darby\\" Calcavecchio. Later, Perrier met Licavoli and got on his knees and begged Licavoli's forgiveness. Perrier continued his erratic behaviour. Around 1981, Perrier was found shot to death. Suspecting that Perrier was talking to the feds, Sinito killed him. He and another mobster picked Perrier up and drove him to an area near Warren, Ohio. After repeatedly shooting Perrier four to five times in the head, Perrier didn't die and continued to struggle with them. According to Lonardo's testimony to the Committee on Governmental Affairs in 1988, Perrier told Sinito, \\"You son of a bitch. I thought we were brothers.\\" Perrier lived for a short while, then died. They then dumped the body from the car. Sinito then disposed of the car by burning it, as it was soaked with blood. =Arrest and imprisonment= After Mafia boss James Licavoli was indicted for racketeering in connection with the murder of Danny Greene in 1982, Angelo Lonardo, took control of the Cleveland crime family. He led the family until 1984. During that year, Lonardo was convicted of running the Zagaria drug trafficking network, and was sentenced to life in prison. He then became an informant, making him the highest ranking Mafia turncoat up to that time. He informed on powerful Mafiosi from numerous families while in prison, and caused serious damage to the Cleveland family's infrastructure. On October 16, 1981, Sinito was convicted of conspiring to conduct a racketeering activity, engaging in a racketeering activity, making extortionate extensions of credit, making collections of extensions of credit by extortionate means, attempting to evade income tax, and filing false and fraudulent income tax returns. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment and a $20,000 fine. Sinito began serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland, Kentucky on November 19, 1981.United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit: Sinito vs Kindt On July 2, 1986, Sinito pleaded guilty to charges of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, and possession with intent to distribute; cocaine. He was sentenced by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, to a term of imprisonment of twenty-two years, and a concurrent term of imprisonment of five years, with a special parole term of three years. This sentence was to run concurrently with the federal sentence Sinito had been serving. On July 17, 1986, Sinito plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter in connection with the 1981 execution murder of David Perrier, in Trumbull County. He received a sentence of seven to twenty-five years for manslaughter from an Ohio state court. Even while incarcerated, Sinito remained a major influence in the Cleveland Mafia. Angelo Lonardo warned the FBI, that Sinito was one of the few made members who possessed the strong will and determination necessary, to revive the Cleveland family after being released from prison. From prison, Sinito recommended two new members, Russell Papalardo and Joseph \\"Loose Lips\\" Iacobacci, Jr, be inducted into the Cleveland crime family in 1983. He was seeking early release from the state parole board, when he died of a heart attack in the exercise yard, at the Belmont Correctional Institution near St. Clairsville, Ohio. He was 59 years old at the time of his death. During Sinito's funeral service, on December 23, 1997 at St. John's Cathedral, his former defense lawyer, James Willis summed up Sinito's life by calling him \\"courageous and honorable.\\" Of Sinito, Willis said; \\"If he told you something you could take it to the bank. He wasn‚Äôt a cry baby.... He was from the old school.\\" Sinito is buried in Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.  Citations  References  *Porrello, Rick.

Lymph vessels are channels larger than the lymph capillaries that have thicker walls, valves in their lumen and smooth muscles in their walls, thus lymph vessel lymphangion is muscular and capable of contracting on its own. Additionally the lymph in it is propelled forward only because of force exerted on its walls from the exterior. Such forces include skeletal muscle contractions and arterial pulsations. Also, the inspiration during respiration provides a suction pressure within the lumen. The semilunar valves are directed towards the flow of the lymph and open when the pressure in the first lymphangion is greater than the pressure in the next lymphangion.

Alternatively, pressure within the next lymphangion may decrease because of negative pressure as a result of inspiration. Once the lymph flows into the next lymphangion, it cannot return to the previous lymphangion, as the semilunar valves close tightly. In conditions when the pressure in a lymphatic is sufficiently great, the valves may fail, and there can indeed be backward flow of lymph resulting in edema of the drained region. This may happen with blockage of lymph flow because of pathology in the draining lymph node or at some point in the vessel.

It was subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The Border Guard also assisted with Search and Rescue missions. In 2010, the organization was superseded by the Police and Border Guard Board. History=Formation and disbandment (1918-1940)= On November 14, 1918, admiral Johan Pitka organized a meeting to discuss the guarding of borders of the freshly established Republic of Estonia. On November 18, 1918, the Border Guard government () was established, with captain Leopold T√µnson leading it. Until 1 January 1919, the agency was subordinate to the Estonian Defence League Council of Elders (), but was then subordinated to the Ministry of Finance. From 1 February 1919 to the end of the Estonian War of Independence the borders were guarded by the military. Since 15 February 1919 until May 1921 the crossing of borders was checked by the Republic's Border Control Government (). On 30 May 1922, the border guard agency was subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior. Following the recommendation of Minister of the Interior, Kaarel Eenpalu, the Border Guard Government () (not to be confused with the previous Border Guard government) was established on 20 September 1922. Lieutenant colonel Ants Kurvits was appointed to lead the organization on 1 November 1922, which is also considered the official formation date of the Estonian Border Guard. Lieutenant colonel Arved Engmaa became his deputy. On 1 December 1922, the Estonian government approved the structure of the agency, consisting of: a headquarters, departments, districts, and cordons. The headquarters started work in January 1923, at the White hall of the Toompea Castle. Positions were manned with reserve officers from the military and conscripts serving under a one year contract. By May 20, 1923, all control over the border was transferred from the Defence Forces to the border guard. There were eight district stations: Tallinn, L√§√§nemaa, P√§rnu, Valga, Petseri, Tartu, Peipsi and Narva. On 1 December 1923, Valga station was joined with Petseri, and on 1 July, Tartu station was joined with Peipsi, and P√§rnu was joined with L√§√§nemaa into L√§√§ne station. On 16 February 1923, a corporation for officers was established. On 16 June 1927, a similar corporation was established for the conscripts. Until the mid 1930s, the legal ground for the activities of the border guard was based on an old law, established under the Russian Empire. On 5 June 1936, a new Border Guard Act was entered into force. Despite legal agreements with the Soviet Union, a tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1938, when Soviet border guards entered Estonian territory and killed two Estonian border guards and one civilian. On the 10th anniversary of the Border Guard, the agency received its flag. In 1940, the agency was partially disbanded by the occupying Soviet Union forces. The eastern border structures were demolished. By then there were roughly 1100 border guards. Large number of Estonian Border Guard officers were repressed and sent to Gulags. =Restoration and unification (1990-2010)= Estonian customs office in Narva during 1991.Luhamaa border crossing in 2005. The restoration of Estonian Border Guard began with the formation of the Estonian Home Defence (), a volunteer organization, created in response to the attack on Toompea by the Intermovement on 15 May 1990. The guarding of borders was organized with volunteers. The situation with borders was dire - the border was unmarked, there was no communication equipment nor transport, not to mention work and living spaces. Furthermore, Soviet troops were still residing in Estonia. On 20 September 1990, the Minister of State Raivo Vare formed a commission, which was tasked with establishing control over Estonian borders. On October 1, training of future border guards began. On 15 October, an economic border defence service was established inside the Home Defence organization. An act regarding the economic border of Estonia was passed on 22 October and checkpoints began work three days later. The restoration date of the Estonian Border Guard is considered to be November 1, 1990, when the government approved 27 permanent checkpoints. On 15 September, Remniku Training Center began operating in Ida-Virumaa, with Johan Saar appointed to head it. The Estonian National Border Guard Board () was formed on April 8, 1991. During that period, the situation on the southern border was tense because Riga's OMON continuously assaulted Estonian checkpoints. On 15 November, border control was established on highway checkpoints, railway crossings, trains, harbours and airports. On 28 February 1992, the institution was reformed into the Estonian Border Guard (), under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. On March 9, the Border Guard College began work. On 1 July 1992, a visa regime was established on the border. On November 1, 1992, the organization received its former flag. On November 16, 1992, the Finnish Border Guard donated the first three ships (PVL-100, PVL-101, PVL-102) to the naval department. In 1993, the National Border Guard Squadron was established, which began operating with two L-410 airplanes donated by Germany. These were later supplemented with four Mil Mi-8 helicopters. In June 1993, Tarmo K√µuts became the head of the organization and the corporation for officers was re- established. In 2000, colonel Harry Hein became the next head of the organization. During that time, employment of conscripts for border control duties was seized and the organization transitioned to a fully professional staff. After Estonia joined the EU and NATO, the border guard went through a reform, establishing the Schengen Area in Estonia. In 2005, lieutenant colonel Roland Peets became the head of the organization. Estonia officially joined the Schengen Area on 21 December 2007. On January 1, 2010, the Estonian Border Guard was joined with the Estonian Police to form a new unified organization called the Police and Border Guard Board. The organizations duties were taken over by the Border Guard Board subdivision.

It has mostly simple, egg-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, small groups of creamy-white flowers and fleshy, more or less spherical, edible fruit. Description Acronychia oblongifolia grows as a shrub or medium-sized tree sometimes to high. The trunk is dark brown and generally smooth, sometimes with fine wrinkles, fissures or pustules. The leaves are mostly simple, arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are leathery, dark green, aromatic and sometimes trifoliate. The flowers are creamy-white and arranged in small groups long, usually in leaf axils, each flower about wide on a pedicel long. The four sepals are wide, the four petals long and there are eight stamens that alternate in length. Flowering occurs from February to June and the fruit is a fleshy, white, yellow or purplish, more or less spherical drupe long, that matures from May to December. The fruit are four-lobed and have a tuft of hairs on the end.Floyd, Alexander G., Rainforest Trees of Mainland South-eastern Australia, Inkata Press 2008, pp. 346‚Äì347. Taxonomy The white aspen was first formally described in 1934 by William Jackson Hooker in The Botanical Magazine from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham. Cunningham gave it the name Cyminosma oblongifolia. In 1840, Stephan Endlicher proposed changing the name to Acronychia oblongifolia and the change was published by the German botanist Gustav Heynhold in his book Alphabetische und Synonymische Aufzahlung der in der Jahren 1840 bis 1846 in den europ√§ischen G√§rten eingef√ºhrten Gew√§chse nebst Angabe ihres Autors. The specific name, from the Latin folium \\"leaf\\", refers to the oblong shape of the leaves. Distribution and habitat White aspen is found from near Gympie in central- eastern Queensland, south through eastern New South Wales to a few rainforest communities in eastern Victoria. Its natural habitat is rainforest and rainforest margin. Mostly shrubby, places where Acronychia oblongifolia reaches tree size include the rainforest of the McPherson Range on the New South Wales/Queensland border, and the Mitchell River Gorge in Victoria. Ecology The fruit are ripe between May and November (to January in Victoria) and are consumed by the green catbird, regent bowerbird, satin bowerbird, pied currawong, topknot pigeon, white-headed pigeon, blue-faced honeyeater and wompoo fruit dove. Uses=Use in horticulture= Acronychia oblongifolia is fairly readily cultivated in a well-drained soil with a sunny aspect, and benefits from extra water and fertiliser. It is somewhat frost tender when young. It is propagated by seed or cutting. =Use in food= Reported have an aromatic lemon/orange flavour, the berries can be served with salads and side dishes or served cooked with seafood or poultry. They can also be used in preserves, sauces, juices and cocktails.

Persons in immigration detention may at any time opt to voluntarily leave Australia for their country of origin, or they may be deported or given a bridging or temporary visa. In 1992, Australia adopted a mandatory detention policy obliging the government to detain all persons entering or being in the country without a valid visa, while their claim to remain in Australia is processed and security and health checks undertaken. Also, at the same time, the law was changed to permit indefinite detention, from the previous limit of 273 days. Mandatory detention continues to be part of a campaign by successive Australian governments to stop people without a valid visa (typically asylum seekers) entering the country by boat. The policy was instituted by the Keating Government in 1992, and has been varied by the subsequent Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison Governments. The policy is regarded as controversial and has been criticised by a number of organisations. The High Court of Australia has confirmed, by majority, the constitutionality of indefinite mandatory detention of non-citizens.Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562 Mandatory detention rules also apply to persons whose visa has been cancelled by the Minister, for example on character grounds, allowing such persons to be detained in immigration detention and deported, some after living in Australia for a long period. Furthermore, if a person has Australian citizenship and another citizenship, his Australian citizenship can be revoked. Length of detention There is no maximum time limit for detaining a person in Australia under immigration laws. The length of immigrant detention has steadily increased in the past decade, and as of May 2020, the average period of time for people held in detention facilities was 553 days. The Australian Department of Home Affairs provides updated monthly detention statistics. In some cases, people have been held in detention for over 10 years, such as Ghader, an Ahwazi man from Iran who has been detained since 2010, and Said Imasi, a stateless man born in Western Sahara. Ghader has a daughter, born in 2015, whom he has not seen since she was a baby. In February 2019, Imasi made a legal challenge to the High Court of Australia, attempting to overturn the landmark Al Kateb v Godwin decision. In June 2019 it was revealed that a Tamil man from Sri Lanka had been held in detention for 9 years. The man, who was blind, as well as mentally and physically disabled, was being held in Villawood Detention Centre at the time of publishing. In 2002-2003 the man was captured by the Sri Lankan Army and tortured, after which he fled the country. He was recognised as a refugee by Australia, but received an adverse security assessment from ASIO. History of mandatory detention Mandatory detention of asylum seekers (technically, \\"unlawful arrivals\\") in Australia was established by the Keating Government by the Migration Reform Act 1992 which came into operation on 1 September 1994. It was originally intended as an interim measure. Controls on unauthorised arrivals were tightened under the subsequent Howard Government, including under the Pacific Solution policy, contributing to a sharp decline in boat arrivals and, consequently, to numbers of people being detained. The Pacific Solution was dismantled by the Rudd Government and partially restored under the Gillard Government in response to increased boat arrivals and reported deaths at sea. Mandatory detention was introduced to \\"support the integrity of Australia's immigration program\\" and \\"management of Australian borders\\" and to distinguish between those who have submitted themselves to offshore entry processes prior to arrival and those who have not. Under the policy, asylum seekers are mandatorily detained while they \\"undergo an assessment process, including security and health checking, to establish if they have a legitimate reason for staying in Australia\\".(20 March 2013) Janet Phillips & Harriet Spinks. Immigration detention in Australia. Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Commonwealth of Australia. Retrieved 26 July 2013. =Keating Government (1992‚Äì1996)= Before 1992, the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 had created a regime of administrative detention of unlawful boat arrivals. Although officers were obligated to arrest and detain anyone suspected of being an ‚Äòillegal entrant‚Äô, detention was discretionary. Between November 1989 and January 1994, there was a \\"second wave\\" of unauthorised boat arrivals comprising eighteen boats carrying 735 people (predominantly Cambodian nationals). By June 1992 there were 478 people in immigration detention of whom 421 were boat arrivals (including 306 Cambodians), compared to five in immigration detention in January 1985. The Keating Government's interim measures in 1992 were contained in the Migration Amendment Act 1992, which set up a regime of mandatory detention, with bipartisan support. Immigration Minister Gerry Hand told Parliament in his Second Reading Speech: The Migration Amendment Act 1992 did impose a 273-day limit on detention, but specifically disallowed judicial review. The final scheme was contained in the Migration Reform Act 1992, which came into operation on 1 September 1994, which broadened the application of mandatory detention to all who did not hold a valid visa, and removed the 273-day detention limit. The Act also introduced detention charges (detention debts) whereby an unlawful non-citizen was liable for the costs of his or her immigration detention. Non-citizens in Australia without a valid visa were to be considered unlawful and would have to be held in detention, though those who met certain criteria and were not considered flight or security risks could secure lawful status by means of a bridging visa ‚Äì but bridging visas would not be made available to those who arrived in Australia without visas in the first place (such as boat arrivals). The government argued that this distinction was justifiable because visa overstayers had already submitted themselves to proper entry processing offshore and were therefore in a different category to those who had not and that boat arrivals had demonstrated a high likelihood of absconding where detention was not in place. =Howard Government (1996‚Äì2007)= The Liberal- National Party Coalition led by John Howard defeated the Keating Government in the 1996 federal election. In 1999 the Howard Government created the temporary protection visa category for asylum seekers whose claims for refugee status had been accepted. These visas were granted only to unauthorised arrivals and were criticised because they left the refugee in limbo indefinitely. These people did not have rights to work, to family reunion, a right to return to Australia if they left, and their status was to be reviewed every three years. Australia's immigration policies towards asylum seekers were a significant issue in the 2001 federal election. Howard said in a campaign policy speech: The Tampa affair arose during the election campaign. Following the election, the Howard Government made significant changes to Australia's immigration policy. It put in place a policy known as the Pacific Solution, which was implemented by then Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock. Under this policy, many islands were excised from the Australian migration zone, and asylum seekers were removed to third countries to determine their refugee status, namely at detention camps on small island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Also, a policy of turning back boats where possible was instigated. Howard's policies were often controversial, were criticised by some human rights groups and were the subject of protest both within and without detention centres. Through the final years of the Howard Government, Australia's detention facilities were near empty, few boat voyages were being attempted and the practice of detention of children had been ended.(14 August 2012) Gerard Henderson. Boats will keep coming until someone waves the red flag. The Sydney Institute. Retrieved 26 August 2013. Also in 2001, the Border Protection Bill provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia, use reasonable force to do so, provide that any person who was on the ship be forcibly returned to the ship, and guaranteed that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship. The Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 reinforced the practice of mandatory detention, providing for the indefinite detention of asylum seekers. Mandatory detention of asylum seekers was popular with sections of the Australian electorate. Some commentators argue that it helped Howard win the 2001 federal election. While the Australian Labor Party supported the policy as Opposition, in June 2005 a small backbench revolt in Howard's party led by Petro Georgiou and Judi Moylan resulted in some concessions to humanitarian concerns, including the promised release of long-term detainees and review of future cases by an ombudsman. Many of those detained in Australia's detention centres between 1999‚Äì2006 have been asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan who sought protection or asylum under Australia's obligations to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. More than 80 percent of these were found to be refugees by the Immigration Department, with some decisions taking more than 8 months. Few asylum seekers were able to be repatriated. On 6 August 2004, the High Court of Australia handed down its decision in the case of Behrooz v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and held that the harsh conditions of detention did not render the detention unlawful.Behrooz v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 219 CLR 486; On the same day, the High Court also handed down its decision in Al-Kateb v Godwin which held that unsuccessful asylum seekers who could not be removed to another country, despite their wish to leave Australia, could continue to be held in immigration detention indefinitely.Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562; National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention Dr Sev Ozdowski OAM Human Rights Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) held an inquiry into mandatory detention of children who arrived without a valid visa over the period 1999‚Äì2002 (with updates where possible ‚Äì the report was completed in April 2004) . The vast majority of children arrived and were put into mandatory detention facilities with their families for indefinite periods of time with no real opportunity to argue their case before independent tribunal or court. The inquiry found that between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2003, 2184 children were detained after arriving in Australia seeking asylum without a visa. Approximately 14% of those children came to Australia alone (unaccompanied children). Most of them came from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Almost 98 percent of the Iraqi children were recognised as refugees; The inquiry found that children detained for long periods of time were at a high risk of suffering mental illness. Mental health professionals had repeatedly recommended that children and their parents be removed from immigration detention. The inquiry found that the Australian government's refusal to implement these recommendations amounted to \\"..cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of those children in detention\\". The inquiry also found that many basic rights outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child were denied to children living in immigration detention. The key recommendations of the Inquiry were that children with their parents be released immediately into the community and that detention laws should be amended to comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Howard government released the children and introduced limited changes to Migration Act 1958 as a result of the report. Criticism In October 2001, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Australian Prime Minister John Howard regarding new legislation, The Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001. The new act further strengthened the practice of mandatory detention, allowing for indefinite detention of unauthorised arrivals. The letter said: :The recent legislation seriously contravenes Australia‚Äôs obligations to non-citizens, refugees and asylum seekers under international human rights and refugee law. As provided for in Article 2 of the ICCPR, the obligation to respect and ensure rights to all persons, including all non- citizens, applies throughout Australia‚Äôs territory and to all persons subject to Australia‚Äôs jurisdiction. We urge Australia, as we have already urged the US government in similar circumstances, to amend its new legislation or at a minimum to implement it in a manner that fully upholds fundamental norms of international human rights and refugee law. The system of mandatory detention has been the subject of controversy. Opposition to the system on humanitarian grounds came from a range of religious, community and political groups including the National Council of Churches, Amnesty International, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens and Rural Australians for Refugees. Among the intellectual opponents of the system has been Professor Robert Manne, whose Quarterly Essay \\"Sending Them Home: Refugees and the New Politics of Indifference\\" (2004) called for an end to both mandatory detention and the temporary protection visa system on humanitarian grounds. Throughout the controversy, Prime Minister John Howard and successive immigration ministers maintained that their actions were justified in the interests of protecting Australia's borders and ensuring that immigration law was enforced. A 2004 Liberal Party election policy document stated: :The Coalition Government's tough stance on people smuggling stems from the core belief that Australia has the right to decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. Deterrence has been achieved through excision, boat returns, offshore processing and mandatory detention. =First Rudd Government (2007‚Äì2010)= For the final few years of the Howard Government, Indonesian boats carrying asylum seekers to Australia had virtually ceased and Australia's offshore detention centres were near empty. The newly elected Rudd Government, under Immigration Minister Chris Evans, announced a series of measures aimed at achieving what it described as a more \\"compassionate policy\\".(30 July 2008) Sweeping changes to mandatory detention announced. ABC News. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Pacific Solution had involved offshore processing, a system of \\"temporary protection visas\\" for unauthorised arrivals, and a policy of turning back boats where possible. The Rudd Government dismantled all three components, dubbing them \\"ineffectual and wasteful\\". Throughout 2009‚Äì2010, a flow of boat arrivals re-emerged. In July 2008, the Australian government announced it was ending its policy of automatic detention for asylum seekers who arrive in the country without visas. While it remained committed to the policy of mandatory detention as an \\"essential component of strong border control\\", the Rudd Government announced that detention would now be restricted to unlawful non-citizens who pose a threat to the community, those who refuse to comply with visa conditions, or those who need to be detained for the period of conducting health, identity and security checks.(29 July 2008) Tony Burke. New Directions in Detention, Restoring Integrity to Australia's Immigration System .

Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Retrieved 26 July 2013. The Government announced that aspects of the original detention system in Australia would remain, but asylum seekers will be released more quickly. They would only be detained for lengthier time periods if they are deemed to pose a risk to the wider community or have repeatedly breached their visa conditions.(30 July 2008).

Boat people will also be able to access legal advice and apply for an independent review of adverse decisions. Each detainee's circumstances and justification for ongoing detention will be scrutinised by the Immigration Ombudsman every six months. A Migration Amendment (Immigration Detention Reform) Bill 2009 to make these amendments, was introduced but lapsed without being passed.Migration Amendment (Immigration Detention Reform) Bill 2009. Commonwealth of Australia. Retrieved 23 January 2012. The Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Act 2009 was passed by the Australian House of Representatives with several Liberal MPs threatening to 'cross the floor' and vote with Labor, and then passed into law on 8 September when the Senate passed the bill with the support of Senator Nick Xenophon, the Australian Greens, Liberal Senator Judith Troeth and at the last minute Steve Fielding.\\"Liberal senator crosses the floor for asylum seekers\\" Australian Associated Press, 8 September 2009 This act abolished the Keating-era policy whereby the government attempted to reclaim the costs of immigration detention from the detainee upon release. Immigration Department figures in October 2009 showed no improvement in the speed of processing claims since the change of government. As a proportion of the immigration intake, Australia accepted fewer refugees in 2009 than it did at any time under the Howard government. In October 2009, the MV Oceanic Viking was involved in an emergency operation rescuing 78 Sri Lankan asylum seekers in international waters within the Indonesian sea rescue zone. Those rescued were due to be landed in Indonesia, for transfer to an Australia-funded immigration detention centre on the Indonesian island of Bintan. However, the asylum seekers refused to disembark until 18 November, following assurances of fast-tracked processing of their cases for resettlement. As of 29 March 2010, 100 asylum seeker boats had been intercepted within Australian waters during the life of the Rudd government. On 9 April 2010, former Minister for Immigration Senator Chris Evans announced that, with immediate effect, no new applications for people from Afghanistan would be processed for six months; and for Sri Lankans, three months. Senator Evans was quoted as saying that this change would result in a higher rate of refusal of claims based on circumstances in these countries.The Australian. 10 April 2010. Following a complaint lodged in 2011 regarding the resulting indefinite detention, in 2013 the United Nations Human Rights Committee found Australia guilty of 138 counts of illegal detention, lack of judicial remedy, or inhumane or degrading treatment.Michael Gordon, UN finds Australia guilty in 150 cases, The Sydney Morning Herald, August 2013. =Gillard Government (2010‚Äì2013)= Protesters on the roof of the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney, 2011 The Gillard Government undertook a series of adjustments to Australia's system of mandatory detention amid a growing stream of unauthorised boat arrivals. Julia Gillard and immigration minister Chris Bowen mooted various regional options for asylum seeker processing ‚Äì notably East Timor and Malaysia ‚Äì before reverting to Nauru and Manus Island in late 2012. On 18 October 2010, Julia Gillard announced that changes would be made to Australia's mandatory detention policy, and that more children and families would be moved out of immigration detention centres into community-based accommodation, such as centres run by churches and charities.Families freed from detention. Christian Taylor. Australian Times. To accommodate the reduction in detainees, the federal government announced that they would open two new detention facilities ‚Äì a centre in Northam, 80 kilometres north-east of Perth, and an alternative place of detention in Inverbrackie, 37 kilometres north of Adelaide. Northam will house up to 1,500 single men and Inverbrackie will house up to 400 family members. In a press conference, Prime Minister Gillard told media \\"when we came to government we issued detention values about not having children in high security, behind razor wire, and obviously we have worked to deliver on those detention values.\\" She went on to say, \\"obviously we want to see kids in school. I understand that in some particular cases the minister will work through this case by case, there may be some reasons why this may not always be possible, but in the ordinary course of things I want to see kids getting a good education.\\" According to the Immigration Department, as of February 2011, there are currently 5,061 men, 571 women and 1,027 children under 18 living in detention.Statistics ‚Äì Facilities. Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Retrieved 23 January 2012. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that 382 of those under 18 arrived without their parents. Chris Bowen, Minister for Immigration in the Gillard Government oversaw a restoration of offshore processing of asylum seekers following the closure of the system by the Rudd Government. Department of Immigration and Citizenship statistics reflect that there were 4,783 people in immigration detention facilities and alternative places of detention, including 3,951 in immigration detention on the mainland and 832 in immigration detention on Christmas Island as at 31 January 2012. The number of people in immigration detention who arrived unlawfully by air or boat as at 31 January 2012 was 6,031, representing about 94 per cent of the total immigration detention population. There were also 344 people (about five per cent of the total immigration population) who arrived in Australia lawfully and were subsequently taken into immigration detention for either overstaying their visa conditions, resulting in visa cancellation. Following an extended period of increasing boat arrivals and deaths at sea, in May 2011 Gillard announced that Australia and Malaysia were \\"finalising\\" an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers for processed refugees (the plan was dubbed the \\"Malaysia Solution\\"). On 31 August the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed on the basis that it contravened human rights protections established under existing laws. The Government was unable to secure the support of the Greens or Opposition in the Senate for modifications to enable the Malaysia Solution to proceed and instead reverted to expanding onshore processing arrangements. Continued deaths at sea and ongoing boat arrivals kept the issue at the fore of policy debate during the term of the Gillard Government, leading to a major Parliamentary debate on the issue in June 2012, as news reports reached Canberra of another fatal sinking off Christmas Island.(27 June 2012). As it happened: Another sinking brings asylum debate to a head. ABC News. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved 26 July 2013. The government sought changes to the Migration Act, to allow asylum seekers to be processed in Malaysia. The Greens opposed the Bill outright and called for greater opening up of Australia's borders. The Opposition opposed the Bill on human rights grounds and called for restoration of the Howard Government's policies. The government allowed the possibility of returning processing to Nauru, on the condition that Malaysia was also permitted. Unable to secure passage of the Bill through Parliament following the emotional debate, the government convened a panel chaired by Angus Houston to consider options. The Houston Report found that \\"onshore processing encourages people to jump into boats\\" and called for the re-opening of offshore processing at Nauru and Manus Island. Gillard endorsed the plan in August 2012.(13 August 2012) Ben Packham. Labor to act quickly to reopen Nauru, PNG asylum-seeker processing centres. The Australian. News Limited.

If they are found not to be genuine refugees they may be repatriated to their country of origin or be sent to a safe third country other than Australia.

Following the election the newly elected Abbott Government toughened policies to stop asylum seekers arriving by boat and launched Operation Sovereign Borders. A feature of the new government's policy was the total secrecy of the operations and treatment of persons intercepted at sea and those in immigration detention in general. The immigration minister stated that no immigrant who arrives in Australia by boat will be granted a visa, regardless of the legitimacy or otherwise of their claim. The Abbott Government's policy was apparently successful because no IMAs have arrived in Australia since July 2014.Chart of the day: What does it mean when the Government says the boats have stopped? accessed 2.7.2019 The Abbot government also claimed responsibility for the overall decrease in boat arrivals during 2013 ‚Äì 2014, Tony Abbott says his government stopped the boats in 50 days accessed 11.3.2017 however this was primarily due to policy enacted by the 2nd Rudd Government (2013) shortly before the Abbott Government took power in the 2013 Australian federal election. While this claim was incorrect, it was easy to effectively communicate as boat arrivals did decreased around the time of the Abbot Government taking power. In addition, the Abbott Government has been more prepared to cancel visas on character grounds for people who have been lawfully present in Australia for some time, bringing them within the scope of the mandatory detention rules. Also, the Abbott Government has passed legislation to strip Australian citizenship of dual nationals in some circumstances, rendering such persons non-citizens and subject to immigration detention for not holding a valid visa, and deportation. In 2014, the Human Rights Commission published a report, The Forgotten Children, into children in Australian detention, both onshore and on Christmas Island, for the period January 2013 to September 2014 ‚Äî covering the period of Labor and Coalition governments. The report was limited because the HRC was barred from visiting and inquiring as to the condition of children in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru. The report was damning of the treatment of children in immigration detention, at least in Australian territories.Medical Journal of Australia: The Forgotten Children: National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention 2014 In January 2015, the first refugees were moved out of Manus Island Regional Processing Center to a new detention center near Lorengau on Manus Island, in the midst of a hunger strike. The condition of detainees in Nauru was reported in the Moss Review. The final report was produced 6 February 2015,https://www.border.gov.au/ReportsandPublications/Documents/reviews-and- inquiries/review-conditions-circumstances-nauru.pdf and released on 20 March 2015. =Turnbull Government (2015‚Äì18)= On 30 November 2015 there were 3,906 people in Australia's immigration detention, including people in immigration detention facilities in Australia and in Australian-run facilities in other countries. 585 of these were in community detention (a form of detention separate from actual immigration detention facilities) in Australia proper. 70 were children in offshore immigration detention facilities, such as Nauru. The time asylum seekers spent in Australian detention centres as stated by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection show that in December 2015 people in onshore immigration detention had been there for an average 445 days. The average detention period has increased since May 2014.The Age, 12 January 2016: Asylum seeker detention times blow out to record levels under Malcolm Turnbull There were 1792 people in onshore detention, including 91 children, and most were from Iran, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, China, Vietnam and Afghanistan. On 26 April 2016, the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island was breaching their constitutional right to freedom and thus illegal, and ordered the Australian- run detention centre to close. However, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton iterated that the 850 asylum seekers were the responsibility of Papua New Guinea and would not come to Australia. In September 2017, the Department of Immigration awarded a $423 million contract to Paladin Group, a little-known private military contractor, to manage the new centers at Lorengau. The closed-tender process of awarding of the contract, as well as Paladin's past record, attracted widespread criticism and controversy. In November 2017, the last refugees in the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre were forcibly removed to West Lorengau Haus, Hillside Haus and East Lorengau Refugee Transit Center in Lorengau. Doctors Without Borders was denied access to asylum seekers and refugees. On 20 December 2017 Peter Dutton was appointed Minister for Home Affairs, in charge of the newly-created Department of Home Affairs, to be responsible for national security, law enforcement, emergency management, transport security, border control, and immigration functions. =Morrison Government (August 2018 ‚Äì present)= Morrison, with Dutton still in place as Minister for Home Affairs, continued the policies of the previous Coalition governments towards asylum seekers, although they did promise to ensure that all children would be off Nauru by the end of 2018. Medevac bill On 12 February 2019, the Morrison government suffered the first substantive defeat on the floor of the House of Representatives since 1929, after the Labor Party and several cross-benchers supported amendments to the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 (the Home Affairs Bill) proposed by the Senate. The proposed amendments would give greater weight to medical opinion in allowing the medical evacuation of asylum seekers to Australia from Nauru (in the Nauru Regional Processing Centre) and Manus Island (in the Manus Regional Processing Centre). Further amendments followed negotiations between the Opposition and the House of Reps cross-bench members, before the Senate considered and agreed to the amendments to its original amendments on the following day, 13 February. The proposed amendments would affect three laws, being the Migration Act 1958, the Customs Act 1901 and the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. The amended legislation, which had become known as \\"the Medevac Bill\\", passed in the House by 75 votes to 74 and passed in the Senate by 36 votes to 34, being passed as the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Act 2019. The approval of two doctors is required, but approval may still be overridden by the home affairs minister in one of three areas. Human rights advocates hailed the decision, with one calling it a ‚Äútipping point as a country‚Äù, with the weight of public opinion believing that sick people need treatment. In response to the bill passing into law, Scott Morrison announced the re-opening of the Christmas Island detention centre, intimating that this change in the law would provide the signal that people smugglers to begin operating again. In the days following, Dutton said that because of this change in the law, Australians on waiting lists for hospital treatment and those already in public housing were going to be adversely affected. This was seen by Robert Manne as a turning point in Labor Party policy, after having had almost identical asylum seeker policies as the Coalition for the past five years. He also points out the numerous obstacles any potential people smuggler or asylum seeker would have to face, because the deterrent aspects of the policy are still firmly in place, and the new legislation applies only to the approximately 1000 people still on Nauru and Manus (of whom only a relatively small number will be allowed to access the urgent medical attention they need). However, the 2018 ruling was overturned in December 2019, after 37 votes to 35 supported the government's move to repeal the law. Move into detention (Aug 2019) In August 2019, PNG‚Äôs immigration department transferred more than 50 men deemed to be non-refugees to the Bomana Immigration Centre, a detention centre next to the Bomana Prison in Port Moresby. Boochani reported that some men had been approved for a Medevac transfer, and were most likely being targeted. PNG officials said that they continued to encourage non-refugees to depart voluntarily. About 100 men are unable to be deported because their country of citizenship refuses to accept involuntary returns. Ian Rintoul said that many of those being detained are being deemed not to be refugees even though they have never had a refugee determination in PNG.  Criticism of government policy: 2010s  Recent global developments highlight the growing polarisation of the Australian public in relation to their government's policies. From late 2009, the increase in arrivals by boat fuelled a divide in public perception of people seeking asylum between sympathy and apathy. Following election victory by the Liberal/National coalition in 2013, the government mandatory detention policy has been widely criticised. The Refugee Council viewed the immigration detention program as detrimental to Australia's interests in three ways: the people subjected to the detention programs endure inhumane conditions; those working in the detention centres often subjected to emotionally jarring situations; and Australia's reputation as a fair and just nation has been eroded. Timing is also of concern, with many refugees and asylum seekers reporting being detained for several years before receiving status determination from the government. The government often cites deterrence to frame the context in which their policies operate. While the immigration detention program draws some support from the Australian public, the program's treatment of children in detention has been widely criticised. There has been great concern about the adverse impact detention centres have on the health, well-being and development of children. Particularly worrying was the use of detention centres previously used for adults to house children. Wickman Point, one such Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) was previously deemed only suitable for adults, with reports that children had been brought in to live concurrently with the adult population. Re-detention occurs when those being detained by the immigration program are released on Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) while their refugee status is being determined, or who have succeeded in obtaining refugee status and subsequently re-detained for often minor violations, sometimes with lack of access to legal advice. Unaccompanied children have been removed from care in the community and re-detained in closed communities. =2019: Report urges changes to policy= On 13 June, the Andrew & Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales published a paper citing seven principles which should be key to Australia's refugee policy, supported by law and evidence-based research. Professor Jane McAdam, director of the Centre, said that in the last 25 years, policy has changed direction, and that offshore processing, boat turnbacks and mandatory detention \\"not only deny the humanity to people that applied and deflect problems elsewhere, but also violate many of our obligations under international law‚Äù. Deaths in detention From 2000‚Äì2018 there have been dozens of deaths in Australia's immigration detention facilities, as many as 20 of those were suicide. In one case, a man died after publicly setting himself on fire in Nauru Regional Processing Centre to protest how he was being treated. Several more people have committed suicide after release, due to mental health issues connected with them being detained. Cases of wrongful immigration detention In February 2005, it was revealed that a mentally ill German citizen holding Australian permanent residency, Cornelia Rau, had been held in immigration detention as an unauthorised immigrant for 11 months, after identifying herself as a backpacker from Munich under the name of Anna Brotmeyer. An audit in May 2005 revealed 33 cases of people wrongfully detained under the Migration Act 1958. This included the case of a woman, Australian citizen Vivian Alvarez Solon, who was forcibly deported to the Philippines and who subsequently went missing. As of May, it was not known how many actually spent time in an immigration detention facility. By late May, Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone announced that more than 200 cases of possible wrongful immigration detention had been referred to the Palmer Inquiry. In October 2005, the Commonwealth Ombudsman revealed that more than half of those cases were held for a week or less and 23 people were held for more than a year and two of them were detained for more than five years. Australia's longest-serving detainee in immigration detention was at the time, Peter Qasim who was detained for almost 7 years before being released in 2005 on a bridging visa. However there has since been prisoners held for longer. In 2006, the federal government made a $400,000 compensation payout to an 11-year-old Iranian boy, Shayan Badraie, for the psychological harm he suffered while being detained in Woomera and Villawood detention centres between 2000 and 2002.

ThunderRoad, Le Survivant) Board Game Geek's game data is a post-apocalyptic themed racing board game invented by Jim Keifer and published by Milton Bradley. Using an assortment of four different vehicles each ranging from a modified dune buggy to a gyrocopter, players must race down an infinite roadway against one another. The goal of the game for players is to either be the last player team alive (e.g., eliminate all other player vehicle teams) or simply out race (i.e., out distance) the other teams. Although the game was originally published by Milton Bradley in 1986, Hasbro currently owns the rights to the game, since it acquired Milton Bradley in 1984. Game play After the game pieces have been assembled (first time setup time can be approximately ten minutes due to game piece complexity), the switch & link game board has been set up with its appropriate hazard areas (wrecks), and player colors have been selected play begins. Initial play consists of each player rolling three yellow dice and moving their vehicles for the number of spaces rolled on a per die per vehicle basis. Once all players have done this, the rest of the game proceeds with each player rolling to move and also trying to attack opposing player vehicles. Attacks can be done by a player ramming their vehicle into their opposition's vehicle, shooting at their opponent's vehicle with vehicle-mounted artillery or using their aerial vehicle (the Thunder Chopper) to attack. As play progresses along the game board, it is constantly extended by using the back portion of the board; the Rear Board. Indeed, a way in which a player can beat an opponent is by getting all of his cars and chopper onto the forward-most game board (Lead Board) faster than his opponent's vehicles. If a player is lagging too far behind and is still on the rear-most game board section (Rear Board) by the time another player has reached the end of the Lead Board, any vehicles on that portion of board are permanently removed from the game; this suggests that the car was \\"outrun\\". An exception to this rule applies only to the Thunder Chopper, it can stay in play as long as a player has at least one running car remaining.

Early life Tarapipipi Te Waharoa, later known as Wiremu Tamihana, was born around 1805 at Tamahere on the Horotiu plains, the son of the MƒÅori chief Te Waharoa and Rangi Te Wiwini. His father was the leader of the tribe NgƒÅti HauƒÅ, which settled the area along the Waikato River near Horotiu as far east as the Kaimai Ranges. In his youth he fought in several expeditions that took place in the Taranaki and Waikato as part of the Musket Wars. In 1835, Tarapipipi met Reverend A. N. Brown, who had set up a Church Mission Society (CMS) station near the Matamata pƒÅ. He was taught to read and write in the MƒÅori language and soon would become a key communicator for his father. He was still from time to time engaged in outbreaks of intertribal warfare, particularly against Te Arawa tribes; during one raid in the Rotorua region, he intervened to ensure the safety of two missionaries during the destruction of the CMS station at Ohinemutu by the Te Arawa tribe NgƒÅti Whakaue, with whom NgƒÅti HauƒÅ was fighting. The conflict at this time led to Brown abandoning the CMS station at Matamata and shifting to Tuaranga but he continued to influence Tarapipipi with his Christian teachings. As chief thumb Following the death of his father in September 1838, Tarapipipi became a leader of NgƒÅti HauƒÅ despite being the second oldest son. He quickly stamped his authority as chief, when he resisted efforts by his tribe to carry out raids against Te Arawa. In October 1838, wielding a bible and referring to Christian ideals, he made an impassioned plea at a hui of Tauranga and NgƒÅti HauƒÅ MƒÅori against war with Te Arawa. His efforts prevented a major battle between the tribes although there some isolated fighting. Soon after taking over as chief of NgƒÅti HauƒÅ, Tarapipipi had founded a new pƒÅ near Matamata, naming it Te Tapiri with rules based on the ten commandments. By the following year, there were 300 people living at Te Tapiri, which now included a chapel and a school. By this time, Tarapipipi had converted to Christianity, being baptised by Brown at Tauranga and given the Christian name Wiremu Tamihana, which translates to William Thompson. The replacement church was capable of holding up to a thousand people. There is no doubt Tamihana was a highly intelligent man with a creative mind keen to learn from the British. He also taught in a school, established farming in his community, and traded produce to PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers in Auckland. Another Christian community was founded in 1846 at Peria. He sold many acres of his tribal land that was swampy to the Scottish Morrin brothers who hired Irish navvies to dig ditches and drain the land and turn it into some of the most fertile dairy land in New Zealand. In the late 1850s, Tamihana was largely responsible for the establishment of the MƒÅori King Movement, which aimed to unify rebel MƒÅori by setting up a kingship in opposition to the British government. He was able to persuade several iwi to join the movement, and Potatau Te Wherowhero of NgƒÅti Mahuta to take on the role of first King. Tamihana provided a statement of laws, based on the Bible. Although the movement was seen by many PƒÅkehƒÅ and the government as rebellion, Tamihana intended that the MƒÅori King would be in alliance with Queen Victoria. Tamihana became a diplomat and publicist for the movement, founding a MƒÅori language newspaper for it. In 1861 Governor Thomas Gore Browne issued a declaration demanding MƒÅori submission to the British Crown. Tamihana wrote to him explaining that the King Movement was not in conflict with the Queen but refused to swear the oath of allegiance. He expressed concern that the Governor seemed intent on war but failed to see the implications of rebellion. Later, he wrote a series of 14 threatening letters to Grey who realised that Tamihana was backed by the fierce Rewi Maniapoto. When war did break out, after the killing of 7 British soldiers in a time of peace in Taranaki and the attempted murder of Gorst, a government agent at Te Awamutu, Tamihana remained in favour of negotiation, but others within the King Movement, such as Rewi Maniapoto preferred to fight. Throughout the Invasion of the Waikato Tamihana attempted to negotiate with government forces, to little effect. After the war he campaigned against the resultant confiscation of land. Later life and legacy John Kinder, January 1863 In 1865 the Pai MƒÅrire movement (commonly known as Hauhau) was active on the Eastern Bay of Plenty and at Opotiki on 2 March shot, hanged and decapitated the German-born Rev. Carl Sylvius V√∂lkner. Following the so-called V√∂lkner Incident, Tamihana separated himself from the Pai MƒÅrire movement and returned to his land. Tamihana became ill in July 1866 but despite this continued to play a role in tribal matters. He intervened in disputes between Tauranga Maori and surveyors and attend hearings at the Native Land Court. He died at Turanga-o-moana, near Peria, on 27 December 1866. By 1873, Waikato rebels had 120,000 acres of land returned and in 1926 and 1946 were paid large sums of cash annually as full and final payment for land. Tamihana's iwi NgƒÅti HauƒÅ were keen land sellers and this later bought them into conflict with NgƒÅti Maniapoto over the issue of land ownership or mana whenua. Tupu Taingakawa was one of Tamihana's sons. Tamihana continues to be recognised today, with the NZ Herald naming him one of the 10 greatest New Zealanders of the past 150 years and the new main connector road between SH21 (Airport Road) and Devine Road running along the public reserve in the heart of Tamahere bears his name : Wiremu Tamihana Drive.

Warje used to be one of the Octroi checkpoints. At the Warje junction, commonly referred to as the Warje Chowk, one road leads to Deccan Gymkhana, via Karve Road, and the other to Khadakwasla dam, one source of Pune's drinking water, and the National Defense Academy (India), one of India's premier military training institutes. Geography Warje is situated about 10 km from the center of Pune. Warje is on the bank of the Mutha river, making the village a catchment area for the western hills due to good soil and sufficient water for farming. It hosts a dense forest in the proximity of the river and creek areas.  History  Before 1970, Warje was a small village with farming as the main economic activity. Warje was one of the stops during sheep migration from Konkan to regions inland. Warje lies between Singhgad Fort and Pune. Signs of this linkage can be seen in rocky areas next to Ganpati temple at the west of the town. Ganpati temple has existed since 1982 and probably for quite some time before that. The temple was rebuilt in 1990 and is known as Ganpati Mathab. Warje gaon existed in Shivaji's era. After 1970, Pune's population increased dramatically. This led Warje to develop as a suburb. Major parts of the forest and fertile lands were converted to apartment complexes. Most of the land became occupied by housing complexes. Each morning just under the Warje fly-over bridge, a crowd of unskilled labourers await daily work from contractors, transporters and construction companies. The smaller region of 'Malwadi' within Warje has seen rapid growth in the new millennium mostly due to the advent of several large housing complexes. Population boomed increasing stress on public infrastructure.  Transport  Warje is connected by an extensive network of local municipal city buses to all parts of Pune. The buses operate from the \\"Ganpati Matha\\" bus station in Malwadi and connect the suburb to Swargate, Katraj, Shivajinagar, Pune station, Market Yard, etc. and even up to Chinchwad and Nigadi. It is near the heart of the Pune City (Deccan Gymkhana - 7 km, Pune Station - 10 km)  Real estate  Because of its proximity to downtown and to the National Defence Academy (preventing development to the west), land prices in Warje-Malwadi have skyrocketed.

Bible translations into Aramaic covers both Jewish translations into Aramaic (Targum) and Christian translations into Aramaic, also called Syriac (Peshitta). Jewish translations Aramaic translations of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) played an important role in the liturgy and learning of rabbinic Judaism. Each such translation is called a Targum (plural: Targumim). During Talmudic times the targum was interpolated within the public reading of the Torah in the synagogue, verse by verse (a tradition that continues among Yemenite Jews to this day). Targum is also an important source for Jewish exegesis of the Bible, and had a major influence on medieval interpreters (most notably Rashi). Maimonides (Hilchot Ishut 8:34) writes that the Talmudic definition of a \\"person who knows how to read and translate the Torah into Aramaic\\" refers to \\"the Aramaic translation of Onkelos\\".Yonatan Kolatch Masters of the Word: Traditional Jewish Bible Commentary from the ... 2006 - Volume 1 - Page 163 \\"See Rambam, Hilchot Ishut 8:34, where he writes that the Talmudic definition of a \\"person who knows how to read and translate the Torah into Aramaic\\" refers to \\"the Aramaic translation of Onkelos the proselyte.\\" E.Z.

It continues to serve as the Bible of churches in the Syriac tradition (Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic, and Syriac Orthodox) to this day. The history of Christian Translations of the Bible into Syriac language includes: the Diatessaron, the Old Syriac versions (Curetonian and Sinaitic), the Peshitto, the Philoxenian Version, the Harklean Version and the recent United Bible Societies' modern Aramaic New Testament. About AD 500 a Christian Palestinian Aramaic version was made. It contains 2 Peter, 2-3 John, Jude, and Apocalypse. It is a representative of the Caesarean text-type and is a unique translation different from any other which was made into Syriac. These are among the manuscripts used by John Gwynn in 1893 to complete his edition of the Catholic Epistles. In 1892 Agnes Smith Lewis discovered the manuscript of the Palestinian Syriac lectionary in the library of Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. It is designated by Syrpal. The first revision of the New Testament from the Syriac into Turoyo language (Western Aramaic in Syriac and Latin script) was made by Malphono Yuhanun √úzel (Bar Shabo), Benjamin Bar Shabo and Yahkup Bilgic in 2009 with notes from Harclean and Philoxenios.

The leaves are 1‚Äì3 cm long and 0.5 cm wide, opposite, lanceolate to elliptical, glossy above with silky hairs beneath. The small white flowers are 7-10 mm in length, they have five petals and a large number of sepals, they are then followed by dotted mauve sweet edible berries which ripen in summer and autumn and contain three to nine pale brown seeds. Elliot, W.R., and Jones, D.L., Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants, 1982, Distribution and habitat The species occurs in New South Wales and Queensland, from Grafton to Fraser Island. It occurs as a common understorey plant of heathland and woodlands and also growing on sandy soils and occasionally on the margins of rainforests. Uses The berries are a popular traditional bushfood, eaten by indigenous Australians and non- indigenous people. The melt-in-the-mouth berries are sweet and aromatic, with a pleasant gingery flavour. While recognized as having good flavour qualities, the berries have not been commercialized due to harvesting and handling issues. Midgen is also popular in amenity horticulture as an adaptable shrub for a variety of situations, handling a range of soils and climatic conditions.

In Nigeria it is played by the Dakarkari people. It is popular in Niger among the Zarma, who call it dili, and it is also played in Burkina Faso. In the Hausa language (Niger and Nigeria), the game is called doki which means horse. It is an alignment game related to tic-tac-toe, but far more complex. The game was invented in the 19th century or earlier. The game is also known as derrah and is very similar to Wali and Dama Tuareg. Goal To form three-in-a-rows, and eliminate enough of your opponent's pieces that he or she can no longer form three-in-a- rows. Equipment The board is a 5x6 square board. Each player has 12 pieces. One player plays Black and the other plays White, however, any two colors will do. In Niger, people simply dig out 30 holes in the sand; one side takes doum nuts, the other short sticks. Game play and rules # Players decide among themselves who starts first. # The board is empty in the beginning. Players take turn placing their stones onto the empty cells of the square board. This is known as Phase 1 of the game or the Drop phase. # After all 24 stones have been dropped, Phase 2 or the Move phase begins. Players will then take turns moving their pieces orthogonally into an adjacent empty cell. # Players attempt to make a three-in-a-row with their own pieces. The three-in-a-row must be orthogonal and not diagonal. Furthermore, it must be strictly three pieces in a row, and not four or more pieces in a row; four or more pieces formed in-a-row are illegal. If a three-in-a-row is made by a player, he or she can remove one enemy piece from the board which is not part of a three-in-a-row itself. # If a player can no longer make three-in-a-rows with their remaining pieces (e.g. if the player only has two pieces left), he or she is the loser, and the other player is the winner. Three-in-a-rows made during the Drop phase do not count. Therefore, a player cannot remove another player's stone during the Drop phase even if one were to make a three-in-a- row. (In Niger, it is not allowed to make a three-in-a-row during the Drop phase.) Moreover, the rule that four or more pieces in a row are illegal to form also applies in the Drop phase. If a player were to successfully form two three-in-a-rows in one move during the Move phase, only one enemy piece can be removed.

Embossing tape is used with embossing machines, often handheld. The company name and trademark \\"Dymo\\" is often associated with this sort of label as their CEO Rudolph Hurwich first introduced it as a consumer product in 1958. Embossing tape have largely been replaced with thermal transfer printing tape used by label printers, but is returning in popularity as 'vintage' looks become increasingly popular. Method The machine features multiple embossing dies arranged on two parallel wheels. Each character has one positive die and one negative die. Typically all of the negative dies are constructed on one rigid wheel, while all the positive dies are constructed on a divided flexible wheel, similar to the daisy wheel of a daisy wheel printer. The user turns the wheel to align the desired character with the tape and then presses a trigger, which forces one positive die against the tape, which deforms some of the tape into the negative die. Upon releasing the trigger, a mechanism advances the tape to the next character position. The embossed characters stand out from the tape and look white due to stretching of the plastic. Embossing tape and the embossing device itself are relatively inexpensive to buy, usually around $10 from stationery stores. Because of this, embossing tape has found popularity with children and adolescents. Unlike paper labels, embossing tape is very durable, does not fade over time, rarely leaves a sticky residue, and does not break upon removal. Because of the method for embossing, the characters can only be white in color. Sometimes, the adhesive backing of the tape can weaken, especially if it is placed in liquid or dust. The tape is more rigid than most other labeling materials, and may come loose if the labeled object bends or under the force of its original curvature, if the label is not straightened after being printed. Graphic design Because of the distinctively industrial, workaday image of embossing tape, it has been common for designers to use images of embossing tape as lettering. The practice was particularly common during the 'grunge typography' graphic design period of the 1990s and 2000s, which often used composited images produced by computer. Embossing tape lettering has been used by bands such as Snow Patrol and The Libertines and poet Rick Holland; it may be intended to evoke labelling used to mark magnetic tapes.

She was an independent candidate for the publicly elected Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation in the city's 2008 municipal election, after being controversially blocked from running on the Non-Partisan Association ticket.\\"Jamie Lee Hamilton calls Peter Ladner a \\"closeted Republican\\" , Georgia Straight, September 2, 2008. Hamilton was a lifelong resident of the Downtown Eastside and Strathcona, Vancouver. She ran for Vancouver City Council in 1996, becoming the first transgender person ever to run for political office in Canada.Peace River Block News Dawson Creek, BC; 1995 December 15, page 8. Early life Jamie Lee Hamilton was the child of Ralph Hamilton and Alice Hamilton. Ralph was an immigrant from Washington State, with Irish roots, who championed the unity of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ralph was also a union organizer with the Foundry Workers' Union. Alice was from the Rocky Boy Band and became a leader of the aboriginal community in Vancouver.Mirror Strathcona Community News, Vancouver, BC; 1977 September 22, pages 4 and 5) She was a founder of the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre in 1954. She was a cannery worker and member of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union (UFAWU). She was one of the Militant Mothers of Raymur who blockaded the Burlington Northern Railway tracks to demand an overpass for the children of Raymur housing project to attend school. In 1967, Hamilton's parents co- founded the Unemployed Citizens Welfare Improvement Council (UCWIC) along with later-to-be Member of Parliament Margaret Anne Mitchell, tenants advocate Margaret Ellen Mitchell, and others. They also were among the first members of the Downtown Eastside Residents' Association (DERA). Hamilton attended Lord Strathcona Elementary School, Britannia Secondary School, and Capilano University. In 1968, in the Moccasin for Miles, she walked from Vancouver to Hope. Beginning in her youth, Hamilton worked in the sex trade and became an advocate of the various communities of which she was a member. In 1970, she was the first youth to be treated in Canada for gender identity disorder. Her doctor was William Maurice of the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre.  Career  Hamilton served on the board of directors of the Greater Vancouver Native Cultural Society, which has served the aboriginal two- spirited community since 1978. Hamilton was a writer, entertainer, and guest lecturer in Women's and Gender Studies at the University of British Columbia and Capilano University, her alma mater. At the time of her death, she was working on a research project at the University of British Columbia, \\"The Expulsion of Sex Workers from Vancouver's West End, 1975‚Äì1985\\", as she was one of those expelled by the court ruling. Controversies In 2000, Hamilton was charged with running a bawdy house when it was revealed she allowed some sex workers to use an East End property as a brothel and safe house, charging them $15 per visit to cover expenses. A year later, Vancouver Sun reported Hamilton used money from her government-funded drop-in centre to help finance her 1999 city council campaign. At the time, Hamilton said her campaign would repay some of those expenditures which had been approved by the drop-in centre's board of directors. In August 2008, Hamilton was preparing a human rights complaint against the Non-Partisan Association, the city's governing party, after it rejected her as a parks board candidate, which she alleges was due to an advertisement she had placed on ShemaleCanada.com, an online meeting place for transgender individuals. This account conflicted with the NPA board's own explanation that neither her gender identity nor her work in the sex trade were factors in her suitability for candidacy. Her complaint was supported by a number of prominent local figures, including former NPA city councillor Alan Herbert, Little Sister's founder Jim Deva, and incumbent park commissioners Loretta Woodcock and Spencer Herbert. Death Hamilton died at age 64 on December 23, 2019. She had been in hospice care in Grandview‚ÄìWoodland since December 9.

(ed) South Africa: Military Intelligence and Intelligence Coordination, Library of Congress Country Studies, 1996 as well as to suppress political dissidents. He was known as \\"Tall Hendrik\\" () on account of his height (). Biography Born in Vredefort, Orange Free State into an Afrikaner farming family, van den Bergh was a lifelong Afrikaner nationalist. He opposed South African intervention in World War II, and, with future Prime Minister John Vorster, joined the Ossewabrandwag (\\"Oxwagon Sentinel\\"), a paramilitary organization modelled on the Nazi SA which engaged in acts of sabotage against the South African government to undermine the war effort. Both men were detained by the government under wartime emergency laws for their activities. After the war, van den Bergh rose rapidly through the police ranks. In 1963, he founded South Africa's first intelligence agency, the precursor to B.O.S.S. He and Vorster (later Justice Minister under Prime Minister H.F. Verwoerd) used new security legislation to crush growing resistance against apartheid.Byrnes, Rita M. (ed) South Africa: The ANC and the PAC Turn to Violence, Library of Congress Country Studies, 1996 Although van den Bergh denied B.O.S.S.'s use of hit squads against its enemies, he is nevertheless remembered for sanctioning the use of torture, assassinations, and other tactics against the government's enemies, and he once told a government commission, \\"I have enough men to commit murder if I tell them to kill. I don't care who the prey is. These are the type of men I have.\\" In the mid-1970s, the burgeoning Angolan Civil War between the pro-Soviet MPLA and the anticommunist UNITA factions, drew the attention of the South African government, which feared growing Soviet infiltration in the region. The government was divided on how best to counter the Soviet involvement, with Defence Minister P.W. Botha and Chief of the Army Magnus Malan advocating an all-out invasion, and Prime Minister Vorster (who had succeeded the assassinated Verwoerd in 1966) and van den Bergh favouring only a limited, covert operation. In the end, the latter option was chosen, and the South African intervention did not succeed, when South African forces, in sight of the Angolan capital, were repulsed by a fresh influx of Cuban troops. The United States, which had covertly backed the operation, was forced to withdraw its support when Congress vetoed the Ford administration's request for funding for UNITA; as a result, South Africa was forced to withdraw.Pieter Willem Botha South African History Online B.O.S.S. became increasingly powerful as the 1970s progressed, much to the dismay of Botha; by some accounts, the organization now wielded more influence than the Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs. Nevertheless, B.O.S.S., and by extension van den Bergh himself, met its downfall just a few years later. In 1979, Vorster, who had become State President in 1978, resigned amidst the Muldergate Scandal, in which government funds were used to buy a pro-government English newspaper, The Citizen. B.O.S.S. was found to have been deeply involved in the scandal, as well.Rhoodie's Story, TIME magazine, 26 March 1979More Dirty Tricks New Internationalist, May 1980, Issue 087The Information Scandal South African History Online The following year, Botha, who had succeeded Vorster as Prime Minister, called for van den Bergh's resignation, and in 1980, B.O.S.S. was replaced by a new agency, the National Intelligence Service, and van den Bergh was replaced by Dr. Ni√´l Barnard. In the aftermath of the scandal, van den Bergh retired and faded from public view to take up chicken farming. Reportedly, he was working on his memoirs in the 1980s, but abandoned the project under pressure from the government. He also resigned as a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond. Van den Bergh died at Bronkhorstspruit, Pretoria, aged 82, in 1997. He was married twice. See also *South African Bureau of State Security *Muldergate Scandal NotesFurther reading *Woods, Donald.

Haas lawsuit In 2008, Frank Joseph Haas, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge during 2005‚Äì2006 and a lawyer and administrative law judge himself, sued the Grand Lodge over its expulsion of him in 2007. In 2006, Haas tried to bring about reforms of the Grand Lodge which would do away with discriminatory practices. This included allowing men of varying races, age groups, and physical abilities into West Virginia Masonic lodges and allowing lodges in West Virginia to support non- Masonic charities. The changes would also permit Prince Hall Masons (predominantly African-American) from other recognized jurisdictions to visit West Virginia lodges. In the meeting at which his term of office expired, Haas claims the reforms were passed by a close vote. The reform proposals were immediately ruled invalid by Charles Coleman, one of two Grand Masters who succeeded him. In November 2007, Haas was expelled by the other Grand Master, Charlie Montgomery. In May 2008 Haas sued the Grand Lodge and the two successors over the expulsion, saying it was without due process, and seeking readmission and damages. The lawsuit was notable for offering \\"a glimpse into the world of the Masons\\", a society that \\"is not exactly secretive, [but] has often been veiled in mystery, as some of its customs and practices are not revealed to non-members.\\" Unusual pre-trial motions sought to ban discussion of Masonic rituals and comparisons to Hitler, and a subpoenaed witness was granted a protective order in which Masons are \\"enjoined and restrained from taking any punitive measures ... as a result of his giving a deposition.\\" One characterization of the result is that a judge ruled that the Grand Lodge had violated its own internal rules, but there was no legal penalty to be applied against the Lodge, and the jury awarded no damages for the breach of contract. More strongly, the defending lawyer stated the jury \\"found in the defendants' favor on all counts\\". A reporter summarized that the case \\"sends a message that [private] organizations have much leeway in how they manage their affairs, make their rules and deal with membership issues.\\" Haas was later admitted in to a Lodge in Ohio, which caused the Grand Lodge of West Virginia to withdraw its recognition of the Grand Lodge of Ohio. In 2013, Haas was reportedly expelled from the Ohio jurisdiction and GLWV again recognized the Grand Lodge of Ohio.

Operational history The 18th Field Artillery Brigade has served in multiple capacities over the past decade in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as the primary 155mm howitzer and HIMARS identity in the war in Afghanistan. The brigade was the only airborne field artillery brigade in the United States Army with 1st Battalion (Airborne), 321st Field Artillery Regiment providing the majority of the support for the 18th Fires Brigade's airborne mission. During the 1990s the Brigade had a single M198, 155mm battery (initially Battery C, 5th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery; later Battery C, 1st Battalion, 377th Field Artillery Regiment) assigned to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in support of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). This made for a healthy rivalry with the other two batteries of the Battalion that were assigned in support of the 82nd Airborne Division. It allowed for the entire Battalion to train together at both Fort Campbell and Fort Bragg. 1st Battalion (Airborne), 321st Field Artillery Regiment maintained a full capacity to provide 155mm howitzer fires anywhere in the world within 18 hours in support of the 82d Airborne Division and while supporting other global responsibilities. The unit had the unique ability to employ 155mm howitzer platforms through a \\"Howitzer Heavy Drop Package\\" capability which essentially allowed for the weapon system to be dropped from an aircraft while its paratroopers would then place the weapon into action. 1st Battalion (Airborne), 321st Field Artillery Regiment served as the United States Army's primary 155mm howitzer response in the Global War on Terrorism. In October 2013, the battalion's three firing batteries were reflagged to create 155mm composite battalions in the three brigade combat teams of the 82nd Airborne, and the battalion was officially inactivated at Fort Bragg on 14 March 2014.https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/5287/2117566/Deactivation-ceremony- of-1st-Battalion-321st-Airborne-Field-Artillery-Regiment During 2008 while serving as the General Support Artillery unit in Operation Enduring Freedom 8‚Äì9, 3d Section, Battery C, 3d Battalion, 321st Field Artillery Regiment became the first United States Army unit to fire the GPS Guided XM982 Excalibur Munition in support of combat operations while serving in the volatile Kunar Province while supporting the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry Regiment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. 3d Battalion, 27th Field Artillery Regiment (HIMARS) has served in the capacity to support various United States Army and other agencies with accurate and effective field artillery rocket fires. From August 2009 through October 2014, the 18th Fires Brigade wore the \\"All American\\" patch of the 82nd Airborne Division. The 18th Fires Brigade became a general support field artillery brigade in July 2008 and was under the Training Readiness Oversight of the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.The Unit Page at the Fort Bragg Website.

The area is roughly that covered by the modern London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and parts of the south of the London Borough of Hackney. The East End has been the subject of parliamentary commissions and other examinations of social conditions since the 19th century, as seen in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor (1851)Henry Mayhew, London Labour and the London Poor (London: Griffin, Bohn, and Company, Stationers' Hall Court) in Volume 1 (1861) , Volume 2 , Volume 3 , and an additional Volume (1862) all accessed 14 November 2007 and Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People in London (1902).Life and Labour of the People in London (London: Macmillan, 1902‚Äì1903) at The Charles Booth on-line archive accessed 10 November 2006 Narrative accounts of experiences amongst the East End poor were also written by Jack London in The People of the Abyss (1903) and by George Orwell in parts of his novel Down and Out in Paris and London, recounting his own experiences in the 1930s. A further detailed study of Bethnal Green was carried out in the 1950s by sociologists Michael Young and Peter Willmott, in Family and Kinship in East London.Family and Kinship in East London Michael Young and Peter Willmott (1957) Themes from these social investigations have been drawn out in fiction. Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural encounters and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes. Though the area has been productive of local writing talent, from the time of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) the idea of 'slumming it' in the 'forbidden' East End has held a fascination for a coterie of the literati.William Taylor (2001) This Bright Field: A Travel Book in One Place The image of the East Ender changed dramatically between the 19th century and the 20th. From the 1870s they were characterised in culture as often shiftless, untrustworthy and responsible for their own poverty. However, many East Enders worked in lowly but respectable occupations such as carters, porters and costermongers. This later group particularly became the subject of music hall songs at the turn of the century, with performers such as Marie Lloyd, Gus Elen and Albert Chevalier establishing the image of the humorous East End Cockney and highlighting the conditions of ordinary workers. This image, buoyed by close family and social links, and the community's fortitude in the Second World War, came to be represented in literature and film. However, with the rise of the Kray Twins, in the 1960s, the dark side of East End character returned, with a new emphasis on criminality and gangsterism. Literature The East End features in one of the earliest works in English, Geoffrey Chaucer's (1343‚Äì1400) The Prioress' Prologue and Tale (ca. 1390), which makes fun of the Prioress' Cockney accent: \\"After the scole of stratford atte bowe, For frenssh of parys was to hire unknowe\\".Line 125. Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales accessed on 14 November 2006 Chaucer, himself lived for many years on the edge of the East End, in the gatehouse of Aldgate. The Isle of Dogs plays a central role in two Jacobean plays, with which Ben Jonson was associated. The Isle of Dogs (1597) was reported to the authorities as a \\"lewd plaie\\" full of seditious and \\"slanderous matter\\". The authors and cast were quickly arrested and the play suppressed.Gurr, Andrew. The Shakespearean Stage, 1574‚Äì1642. (2nd ed.; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992) This play was the root of the argument in which Jonson killed Gabriel Spencer in 1598, at Hoxton fields. Eastward Hoe (1605) was equally scandalous, and resulted in the arrest of the playwrights.Chambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage. 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 254‚Äì6 Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì70), throughout his work, draws extensively on his experiences of poverty in London. His godfather had a sail making business in Limehouse, and he based the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in Our Mutual Friend (1864‚Äì65) on a public house still standing there. The Red Bull, a now demolished inn situated in Whitechapel, features in his Pickwick Papers. On leaving it Sam Weller makes the sage remark that Whitechapel is \\"not a wery nice neighbourhood\\". Fagin in Dickens's Oliver Twist appears to be based on a notorious 'fence' named Ikey Solomon (1785‚Äì1850) who operated in 1820s Whitechapel.Ed Glinert (2000) A Literary Guide to London: 256 Dickens was also a frequent visitor to the East End theatres and music halls of Hoxton, Shoreditch and Whitechapel, writing of his visits in his journals and his journalism.Commercial Traveller Charles Dickens (1865) A visit he made to an opium den in Bluegate Fields inspired certain scenes in his last, unfinished, novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870).Peter Ackroyd (1990) Dickens: 1046A Curious Burial 11 January 1890 East London Observer ‚Äì an account of the burial of Ah Sing, said to be the inspiration for the character of the opium seller. Retrieved 22 July 2008 Arthur Morrison (1863‚Äì1945), who was a native East-Ender, wrote A Child of the Jago (1896) a fictional account of the extreme poverty encountered in the Old Nichol Street Rookery. Oscar Wilde (1854‚Äì1900) observed the practice of 'people of quality' visiting the many entertainments available in Whitechapel and sent his hedonistic hero Dorian Gray there to sample the delights on offer in his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. The experiences of the Jewish community in the East End inspired many works of fiction. Israel Zangwill (1864‚Äì1926), educated in Spitalfields, wrote the influential Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (1892) and other novels on this subject. Another Jewish writer, Simon Blumenfeld (1907‚Äì2005) wrote plays and novels, such as Jew Boy (1935), informed by his years in Whitechapel.Simon Blumenfeld: Novelist, playwright, journalist and revolutionary 18 April 2005 (Obituary, The Guardian) accessed 17 November 2007 Wolf Mankowitz, of Bethnal Green, was another Jewish writer from the area. His 1953 book A Kid for Two Farthings, set in the East End, was adapted for the cinema three years later. Alexander Baron (1917‚Äì1999) was born in Whitechapel and wrote of his wartime experiences in the Invasions of Italy and Normandy in the trilogy From The City From The Plough, There's no Home and The Human Kind. Later he wrote of the East End, including the Jewish gangster novel, King Dido and the Human Kind.Alexander Baron: His novels of war and London caught the essential decency of mankind John Williams 8 December 1999, The Guardian. Retrieved 26 August 2008 Chinatown, Limehouse, also provided inspiration for novelists. Sax Rohmer (1883‚Äì1959) wrote fantasies set there, featuring many scenes in opium dens, introducing one of the 20th century's master villains, Fu Manchu, in a series of novels of which the first was The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu (1913). Thomas Burke (1886‚Äì1945) explored the same territory in Limehouse Nights (1916). Playwrights have often located their work in the East End. During the 1950s and 1960s, much drama was inspired and encouraged by the work of Joan Littlewood and Theatre Workshop, based in the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Their new works explored the experiences and position of their local audience. Many productions transferred both to the West End and were made into films. In the 1970s and 1980s the Half Moon Theatre presented premi√®res of European works and new works by London playwrights, such as Edward Bond and Steven Berkoff. One contemporary manifestation exploring the 'collision of worlds' made possible by the East End is the school of psychogeography espoused most prominently by Peter Ackroyd (1949‚Äì ) in such novels as Hawksmoor (1985) and Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem (1994) and Iain Sinclair (1943‚Äì ) in such novels as White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings (1987). A more realistic fictionalisation on the contemporary gentrification of the area, and the rise of the yuppie, is provided by Penelope Lively in Passing On (1989) and City of the Mind (1991) and by P. D. James in Original Sin (1994). Emblematic of the current worldwide clash of civilisations between West and East, of which the East End has historically been a microcosm, are Monica Ali's (1967‚Äì ) novel Brick Lane (2003), and Salman Rushdie's fantastic and controversial The Satanic Verses (1988) which also uses Brick Lane as a location.Ed Glinert (2000) A Literary Guide to London: 244‚Äì262 TV One of the earliest television portrayals of the East End was Dixon of Dock Green (1955‚Äì1976). In this programme, Sergeant George Dixon pounded the fictional beat of Dock Green, with a script by Ted Willis. The series arose from the film, The Blue Lamp (1950) that was based on the real life murder of a policeman based at Leman Street, Aldgate. The television series enjoyed considerable success. The script was based on research at Paddington Green Police Station and filmed at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios, in West London. The characterisation by the lead, Jack Warner, was held in such high regard that officers from Paddington Green bore the coffin at his funeral in 1981.Sydney-Smith, Susan Beyond Dixon of Dock Green: Early British Police Series pp 105‚Äì6 (I. B. Tauris, 2002) EastEnders, a BBC soap opera broadcast since 1985, is set in the fictional London Borough of Walford. The programme is actually filmed at a purpose-built set at the Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, and the paradigms for the show are thought to lie beyond the East End, in Stratford and Walthamstow. In that, the programme does represent the diaspora of East Enders who have moved out of the district, and draws on the themes of family and social integration. The show rarely evidences changes occurring to east London, such as the Docklands development. An earlier programme, Till Death Us Do Part (1965‚Äì1975) attempted to satirise the stereotypical attitudes of an East Ender, Alf Garnett, played by Warren Mitchell. The locale for this programme has been variously placed in Wapping and West Ham, with the principal character a supporter of West Ham United F.C.. The comedic theme of the programme was the interaction between members of the family, and the inability of the principal character to adapt to the rapid changes in his world. The piece inspired the hit American remake All in the Family, accessed 22 February 2008 among others. One Canada Square, the 235-metre tower, was the tallest building in the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2010, has achieved an iconic status, and is located on the Isle of Dogs.

Other shows set largely in the East End include Ripper Street, Penny Dreadful, Whitechapel, and Call the Midwife. Film Film has also explored the issues and themes affecting the East End. Many early films were made in Hoxton, at Gainsborough Studios. With their association with German cinema realism, many of these were made in the streets around the studio. In more modern films, gangsterism has featured. Sparrers Can't Sing (1962), accessed 22 February 2008 developed by Theatre Workshop, dealt with issues of change in the East End ‚Äì a sailor comes home from the sea, to find his home redeveloped and his family moved to a new council block.

His brutality is only matched by that of the IRA. accessed 22 February 2008 The theme of a return to find a changing society is also brought out in For Queen and Country (1989). accessed 22 February 2008 Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) again explores gangsterism, with change represented by amateur white collar criminals. Conflict arises between them and old firm criminals, immigrant gangsters and a group of less than honest friends, raised in the East End. accessed 22 February 2008 Romantic encounters with a multi- cultural erotic frisson, set in Limehouse's Chinatown, are the theme of Broken Blossoms (1919), derived from a story in Thomas Burke's Limehouse Nights and Piccadilly (1929) starring Anna May Wong as an alluring Chinese nightclub performer. accessed 22 February 2008 Limehouse is also the scene of the Fu Manchu films ‚Äì based on Sax Rohmer's novels. These began with some short British serials 1923‚Äì4 before the first American feature film The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu appeared in 1929, followed by many others.IMDb: Fu Manchu accessed 22 February 2008 Further multi-cultural encounters are featured in the film Brick Lane (2007) based on the novel by Monica Ali. accessed 22 February 2008 The East End is featured as the setting for the Hughes brothers' film From Hell (2001) based on the Alan Moore graphic-novel of the same name, providing a modern interpretation of the Jack the Ripper murders. accessed 15 March 2008 The East End also appears in the film Mary Poppins, when Jane and Michael flee from the bank, and wander into its slums, before going home safely with Bert, a chimney sweep. The 2004 British comedy-crime drama Spivs features a group of East End \\"spivs\\" (British slang for a black marketeer). Music Many music hall acts originated in the East End, including Marie Lloyd, Gus Elen and Albert Chevalier. From the middle of the 18th century, inhabitants of the area had begun to be characterised as shiftless, untrustworthy and responsible for their own poverty. These performers, in particular, saw the many honest people fighting poverty in lowly professions and established the image of the humorous East End Cockney as a part of their stage persona. There are only two surviving music halls in the area, Wilton's Music Hall and Hoxton Hall, but many of the songs survive in \\"pub songs\\"; communal singing in public houses with minimal accompaniment.

Gift of Screws peaked at #48 on the Billboard 200 album chart in September 2008. Billboard Album Chart - Lindsey Buckingham Additionally, it also reached number #15 on the Billboard Rock Album Chart. Album history The album title existed as a solo album set for release in 2001 by Reprise Records. Songs were recorded between 1995 and 2000, some of which were performed and recorded live by Fleetwood Mac for their The Dance album and tour in 1997.
