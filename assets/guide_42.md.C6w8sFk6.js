One is a 1776 letter from a retired royal prosecutor in J√©r√©mie to the Count de Maulde, the son-in-law of Thomas-Alexandre Dumas's uncle, Charles Davy de la Pailleterie. The letter states that Dumas's father (Alexandre- Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, then known as Antoine de l‚ÄôIsle) \\"bought from a certain Monsieur de Mirribielle a negress named Cesette at an exorbitant price,\\" then, after living with her for some years, \\"sold ... the negress Cezette\\" along with her two daughters \\"to a ... baron from Nantes.\\"Original French: \\"il achetais d‚Äôun certain Monsieur de Mirribielle une negresse nomm√©e Cesette √† un prix exhorbitant\\"; \\"qu‚Äôil a vendu √† son depart avec les negres cupidon, la negresse cezette et les enfants √† un sr barron originaire de nantes.\\" Letter from Chauvinault, former royal prosecutor in J√©r√©mie, Saint Domingue, to the Count de Maulde, June 3, 1776, privately held by Gilles Henry. (The spelling of her name varies in the letter itself.) The second is a legal judgment signed by Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, then known as Thomas Retor√© or Rethor√©, and his recently widowed step-mother Marie Retou Davy de la Pailleterie, which attests officially that Retou gave up her property rights over Marie-Cessette Dumas and her two daughters.\\"En consideration des obligations cy dessus contractees par led.

There has been some speculation that the family name \\"Dumas,\\" rather than representing a family name for Marie-Cessette, instead means \\"of the farm\\" (du mas) and constitutes a descriptive addition to her first names meant to signify that she belonged to the property.Gilles Henry, Les Dumas: Le secret de Monte Cristo (Paris: France-Empire, 1999), 73; Victor Emmanuel Roberto Wilson, Le g√©n√©ral Alexandre Dumas: Soldat de la libert√© (Sainte-Foy, Quebec: Les Editions Quisqueya-Qu√©bec, 1977), 25. Others have proposed that the name Cessette may have originated in Gabon, where Marie-Cessette might have been captured by slave traders. According to Francophone novelist Calixthe Beyala, the name \\"Dumas\\" was initially \\"D√ªma,\\" of Fang origin, meaning \\"dignity.\\"Calixthe Beyala's theory is discussed in Albert M‚ÄôPaka, F√©lix Ebou√©, 1884-1944, gouverneur g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique √©quatoriale fran√ßaise: Premier r√©sistant de l'Empire: Grand Fran√ßais, grand Africain (Paris: Editions L'Harmattan, 2008).

Racial identity  The two extant primary documents that state a racial identity for Marie-Cessette Dumas refer to her as a \\"n√©gresse\\" (a black female)‚Äîas opposed to a \\"mul√¢tresse\\" (a female of mixed race). The first is a June 3, 1776, letter from the retired royal prosecutor Chauvinault, who was hired by the Count de Maulde (son-in-law of Thomas-Alexandre Dumas‚Äô uncle Charles Davy de la Pailleterie). It states that Dumas‚Äô father (Alexandre-Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, then known as Antoine de l‚ÄôIsle) \\"bought ... a negress named Cesette,\\" then, after living with her for some years, \\"sold ... the negress Cezette\\" (the spelling of her name varies in the letter itself). In contrast to describing her as a \\"negress,\\" implying she was African, the letter classifies the four children she had with Antoine (including Thomas-Alexandre Dumas) as \\"mulattos.\\"Letter from Chauvinault, former royal prosecutor in J√©r√©mie, Saint Domingue, to the Count de Maulde, June 3, 1776, privately held by Gilles Henry. The second document is a legal judgment signed before \\"the Counselors of King, Notary Publics in the Ch√¢telet of Paris\\" on November 22, 1786, which settled property ownership issues between Thomas-Alexandre Dumas (then known as Thomas Rethor√©) and his step-mother, Marie Fran√ßoise Elisabeth Retou (widow of his father, Alexandre- Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie).

Death  Sources differ on the date and circumstance of her death. Two documents signed by Alex Dumas‚Äîhis contract and certificate of marriage to Marie-Louise Labouret‚Äîstate that Marie-Cessette died in La Guinaud√©e, near Trou J√©r√©mie, Saint-Domingue, in 1772. Based on this death date, Victor Emmanuel Roberto Wilson speculates that she may have died in the mass outbreak of dysentery following a devastating hurricane that struck principally the Grand'Anse region of Saint-Domingue that year.Victor Emmanuel Roberto Wilson, Le g√©n√©ral Alexandre Dumas: Soldat de la libert√© (Sainte-Foy, Quebec: Les Editions Quisqueya-Qu√©bec, 1977), 49-51. There is good reason, however, to believe that she did not die in 1772. Two other documents say Marie-Cessette remained alive after that year. The 1776 letter from Chauvinault to the Count de Maulde, cited above, states that Dumas's father Antoine sold Marie-Cessette in 1775 before returning to France.Letter from Chauvinault, former royal prosecutor in J√©r√©mie, Saint-Domingue, to the Count de Maulde, June 3, 1776, privately held by Gilles Henry. A second document, this one signed by Dumas in 1801, states \\"Marie-Cezette\\" will be in charge of General Dumas's properties in Saint-Domingue.\\" Par-devant le notaire public du departement de Seine-et- Oise [...] √©tait present Thomas Dumas Davy de La Pailleterie, connu et nomin√© Dumas, general de division, demeurant a Villers-Cotter√™ts, departement de l'Aisne [...]. Lequel a fait et constitue pour son procureur general et special Marie-Cezette, sa mere, a la quelle il donne pouvoir de, pour lui et en son nom, d'agir, gerer et administrer les biens, terres, habitations et propri√©t√©s appartenant au constituant, comme fils et heritier d'Antoine Alexandre Davy de La Pailleterie son pere, le tout situ√© cote et ile de Saint- Domingue ; de se mettre en possession du tout pour et au nom du constituant [...] ; et generalement, faire par ladite procuratrice constitue tout ce que sa prudence et les circonstances exigeront; le constituant entendant conferer a ladite procuratrice constitute tous les pouvoirs les plus illimites pour la regie desditeshabitations et autres proprietes, encore bien qu'elles ne soient pas litteralement √©noncees ou representees.\\" Legal document, November 8, 1801, quoted in Raph√§el Lahlou, Alexandre Dumas ou le don de l‚Äôenthousiasme (Paris: Bernard Giovanangeli, 2006), 13 (antique syntax in Lahlou). Lahlou mentions that Gilles Henry provided him with this document. This evidence makes it unlikely that Marie-Cessette Dumas died in 1772. According to the writer Claude Ribbe, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas may have deliberately entered a false death date on the marriage certificate. He had urgent reason to claim she was dead at the moment of his marriage in Villers-Cotter√™ts, France, in 1792. If she were living, he would have been required to consult her opinion on the marital union.\\"Under the Old Regime, an adult had to ask the 'advice' of his parents, even if he didn‚Äôt follow it, before getting married. General Dumas's mother was living in J√©r√©mie and was still legally a slave in 1792, which would probably have stopped the whole procedure, and thus prevented the wedding. The General was in a hurry. He had to leave for the front.\\" (Original: \\"Sous l‚ÄôAncien R√©gime, un majeur devait obligatoirement solliciter, quitte √† passer outre, le ¬´ conseil ¬ª de ses parents avant de se marier.

Stevenson was born in Woodford County, Kentucky, and after briefly living in Indiana in 1821, he studied medicine at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After earning his medical degree, Stevenson returned to Indiana for good in 1826, starting a practice in the city of Greencastle. While living in Greencastle, Stevenson campaigned for Indiana Asbury University to be located in the city; upon the success of his campaign in 1837, he served on the school's Board of Trustees for the next ten years and was its president for the first three.Dory, William A., Jr. National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Appleyard (Stevenson, Alexander C., Farm). National Park Service. July 6, 1988. Stevenson was also an active state politician who served in both the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate. A member of the Whig Party, Stevenson represented Putnam County in the House in 1831-32 and 1844-45; during his second term, he served as Speaker of the House. He served in the Senate for three consecutive terms from 1839 to 1842. In addition, Stevenson made an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, was a member of the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1850-51, and declined a nomination to the U.S. Senate in the 1860s.Weik, p. 698-99 Following his political career, Stevenson began another career as an agriculturalist and stock breeder. In 1843, Stevenson established Appleyard, a farm near Greencastle. While Stevenson first bred merino sheep, he began breeding shorthorn cattle in 1845, and his work with this breed brought him significant success. In 1853, Stevenson visited England to inspect and buy shorthorn cattle for his farm; he was the first breeder to import cattle from England to Indiana. He was appointed to an unofficial State Board of Agriculture in 1847, and when the board became an official state body in 1851, he was one of its founding members. Stevenson served on the Indiana State Board of Agriculture until 1859, excepting 1855 and 1856, and was the board's president for three years. While on the board, Stevenson helped found the Indiana State Fair to promote agricultural development and collaboration. Stevenson also served as a leader for private breeding societies, as he was named president the Indiana Shorthorn Breeders Association after organizing the Indiana Shorthorn Breeders Convention in 1872. Later in the same year, he became president of the American Shorthorn Breeders Association and chairman of the National Swine Breeders Convention.Weik, p. 699 Stevenson married three women, the first two of whom he outlived, and had twelve children, among which he divided his farm prior to his death in 1889. After his death, he was inducted to the Indiana Hall of Fame for Agriculture at Purdue University.

She is known for her work on the cognitive underpinnings of generic generalizations and the relationship between these generalizations and social cognition, and her work on perceptions of brilliance and academic gender gaps. She is the author of numerous articles in philosophy and psychology, and has published in journals such as Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Cognitive Psychology, and Philosophical Review. Leslie's work has been discussed by various media outlets, including The Washington Post, NBC, and The Wall Street Journal, and on the radio at NPR, WHYY, and CBC Radio. Education and career In 1998 Leslie entered Rutgers University as an undergraduate majoring in cognitive science, mathematics and philosophy. She graduated in 2002 summa cum laude. She received her Ph.D. in philosophy in 2007 from Princeton University and was subsequently appointed as Assistant Professor to the philosophy faculty that same year. In 2013 she was awarded tenure and promoted to Full Professor, skipping the position of Associate Professor. In 2014, she was named Class of 1943 Professor of Philosophy. On January 1, 2018, Leslie was appointed Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University. As dean, Leslie supervises the administrative duties of the Graduate School and acts as liaison between the Graduate School and the University. Prior to being named dean, Leslie held several administrative, professional, and service positions at Princeton and served on numerous committees, including the Faculty Advisory Committee on Diversity and the Committee on Appointments and Advancements. Between 2014 and 2017 Leslie was the Director of Princeton's Program in Linguistics, the Director of the Program in Cognitive Science, which she founded in 2015, Acting Chair of the Department of Philosophy, and Vice Dean for Faculty Development in the Office of the Dean of the Faculty. In 2013, Leslie recorded a series of videos titled Philosophical Conversations, in which she interviewed several prominent philosophers including Rae Langton, Roger Scruton, Joshua Knobe and Kwame Anthony Appiah. The series was sponsored by the Marc Sanders Foundation and made available free to promote excellence in philosophy. Research areas Leslie's main research interests lie at the intersection of philosophy and psychology. Much of her work has focused on generic generalizations, which are articulated in language via sentences such as \\"tigers are striped\\", \\"a duck lays eggs\\", \\"mosquitoes carry West Nile virus\\". These sentences are difficult to analyze from the perspective of formal semantics, but are nonetheless easy for young children to acquire and process. These findings and others have led Leslie and her collaborators to hypothesize that generic sentences articulate cognitively fundamental, default generalizations ‚Äì that is, the judgments formed by our cognitive systems' most basic way of generalizing information about kinds and categories. Leslie's work has shown important connections between generic generalizations and social cognition. For example, she and NYU psychologist Marjorie Rhodes‚Äîalong with Rhodes' student Christina Tworek‚Äîfound that when preschool-aged children hear a novel social group described with generic language, they come to think of the group in essentialist terms‚Äîthat is, as marking deep, important, and inherent distinctions amongst people. Further, they found that when parents themselves hold such beliefs about a social group, they tend to produce more generic language when describing the group to their children. Thus, generic language may be an important and powerful mechanism by which social essentialist beliefs are implicitly communicated across generations. More generally, Leslie's work has pointed to multiple connections between generic generalizations and social essentialism, stereotyping, and prejudice. More recently, Leslie and NYU psychologist Andrei Cimpian have studied the impact of stereotypes that link brilliance with men more so than women. In a 2015 paper published in Science, they found that academic disciplines that are perceived to require brilliance for success have larger gender gaps, even when adjusting for standardized test scores and other factors. In subsequent work, they found that even the frequency of adjectives like \\"brilliant\\" and \\"genius\\" in teaching evaluations can predict how diverse an academic field is. Their work has also examined the developmental roots of these stereotypes. In an article published in Science in 2017 with psychologist Lin Bian, they found that girls begin to absorb stereotypes linking brilliance with males by age 6. Further, 6- and 7-year-old girls show less engagement and motivation than boys when an activity is described as being for kids who are \\"really, really smart,\\" but not when it is described as being for kids who \\"work really, really hard.\\" This suggests that stereotypes about brilliance may impact girls‚Äô choices from a very young age. As of January 2017, both Science papers were in the journal's top 1% for media uptake and attention according to Altmetrics. Awards and fellowships Leslie has received numerous awards and fellowships, including the Class of 1943 Professorship in Philosophy, the Jacob T. Viner University Preceptorship, the Mrs. Giles Whiting Honorific Fellowship, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. In collaboration with Dr. Marjorie Rhodes and Dr. Andrei Cimpian, she has been the recipient of multiple grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and other sources. Cimpian and Leslie's work on academic gender gaps was cited as one of the most interesting scientific findings of 2015 by Edge. Leslie has delivered the Gareth Evans Memorial Lecture at Oxford University, and the Daniel Greenberg Distinguished Scholar Lecture at Reed College. She was awarded the Stanton Prize by the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and named a 250th Anniversary Fellow of Rutgers University.

The fossil was discovered by Bob H. Slaughter within some deposits dating back to 112.6 ‚Äì 109 million years ago. On the basis of the morphology of the molars' cusps, in 1965 Slaughter established the new genus Pappotherium and the new species P. pattersoni; he also created an apposite family, Pappotheriidae. Both this family and the genus are nowadays still monotypic. Slaughter argued that Pappotherium should have been a basal form close to the metatherian-eutherian divergence point; this mammal likely was an arboreal insectivore. Etymologically speaking, the name Pappotherium is a compound of the Latin words pappus (from ancient Greek œÄŒ¨œÄœÄŒøœÇ, p√°ppos, ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù) and therium (from ancient Greek Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒØŒøŒΩ, thƒìr√≠on, ‚Äúbeast‚Äù, a common suffix among extinct mammals), with the full meaning of ‚Äúmammal- grandfather‚Äù. The second part of the unique species' name, pattersoni, was instead chosen in honor of the American paleontologist Bryan Patterson. More recently, it has been recovered as a possible deltatheroidean.Guillermo W. Rougier; Brian M. Davis; Michael J.

Sanger‚ÄìBlack apparatusCh. R. Sanger and O. F. Black. The Quantitative Determination of Arsenic by the Gutzeit Method. Proc. Am. Acad. Arts Sci. 1907, 43 (8), 297‚Äì325. On the Web: http://www.unz.org/Pub/Daedalus-1907q1-00295 is a piece of chemical laboratory ware used for quantitative and semi-quantitative determination of arsenic element in the solution. It is constituted by glass bottle of volume ca. 30 mL, sealed with rubber stopper with one or two holes. Through one hole a thistle tube is inserted, almost reaching the bottom, for filling the bottle (what can be done also when the stopper is taken out ‚Äì for semi-quantitative determination). The second, S-shaped tube is for outflow of the gases and joined by another rubber stopper to a bulg tube, with bulb containing pre- dried cotton as adsorbent, presumably intended for homogenizing the gas flow. A thin reagent paper, impregnated with mercury(II) chloride (nowadays replaced by mercury(II) bromide)Kinniburgh, D. G. Kosmus, W. Talanta 2002, 58 (1), 165‚Äì180. or silver(I) nitrate, is placed in the open end of the bulb tube. If the semi-quantitative variant is to be performed, the paper is put in the (only) thistle tube ‚Äì i. e., vertically, not horizontally. During the test ca. 3 g of Zn granules are placed into the bottle, just below the end of thistle tube, and then acid solution is added (ca. 15 mL; authors recommend that HCl is preferable to H2SO4). About 10 minutes are required to let H2 flow along the reagent paper, while this flow and moisture content inside it is stabilizing. Then the sample is introduced, and in case of sample solution containing arsenic the paper becomes more or less stained. The Sanger‚ÄìBlack determination is based on the so-called Gutzeit reaction (1879):Gutzeit, H. Pharmaz. Zeitung. 1879, 24, p. 263 AsH3 is forming from arsenic in any oxidation state when it reduces with the hydrogen in statu nascendi, produced from the acid.Gutzeit test ‚Äì Medical Definition and More from Merriam‚ÄìWebster. On the Web: http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/gutzeit%20test Gutzeit originally used AgNO3 for determination. The innovation to the Gutzeit method by Sanger and Black is the use of long and narrow paper, so that gas flow is directed along it and the product of reaction used as analytic signal deposits almost uniquely in the surface layers of the paper, so that stain area is quantitative analytic signal (if all the prerequisites for determination are fulfilled). Unfortunately, yellow colour is not that human eye is especially sensitive for, so photometric tools were introduced for quantitative analysis quite a long time ago (in 1944).Satterlee, H. S. Blodgett, G. Ind. Eng. Chem. 1944, 16, p. 400 Zinc naturally contains some trace amounts of arsenic, so a modest yellow stain appears almost in any case on the reagent paper. This limits the sensitivity of this test, as arsenic amounts in zinc vary from one supplier to another. That is why later Zn was replaced by sodium borohydride NaBH4; then, strong and corrosive hydrochloric acid was also replaced with sulfamic acid NH2SO3H.

Hall was born in Lee County, Illinois, on March 29, 1874, and raised near Riverside, California. He studied botany at the University of California, earning a B.S. in 1901, M.S. in 1902, and Ph.D. in 1906. In 1910, he married fellow University of California graduate Carlotta Case. Their daughter Martha was born in 1916. He died while in Washington, DC for a conference on March 11, 1932.  Career and research  = University of California = Studying plant taxonomy under W. L. Jepson at the University of California, Hall completed his doctoral dissertation, The Compositae of Southern California, in 1906. He went on to be a professor of botany at the university and botanist for the agricultural experiment station. His early work focused on taxonomic studies of plants in California, and he added over 200,000 specimens to the herbarium. He resigned from his professorship in 1919, but continued to maintain an office and relationships in Berkeley. = Carnegie Institution = While professionally established, Hall went to work for ecologist Frederic Clements at the Carnegie Institution Division of Plant Sciences at Stanford University in 1919 in an effort to explore experimental methods of taxonomy. The pair established methods for conducting reciprocal transplant experiments, whereas plants were moved and studied in the habitats of similar taxonomic species. These experiments provided methods for studying plant adaptation, but did not readily explain mechanisms of plant evolution. In 1924, Hall began to work with geneticist, and friend, E. B. Babcock to look beyond ecological methods to genetics and cytology as experimental methods to explore taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. Hall left Clements group and started to assemble his own experimental team, hiring David Keck and William Hiesey in 1926 and Jens Clausen in 1931. In 1928, Carnegie president John Merriam sent Hall to Europe for a year to study national parks. His report suggested the creation of natural reserves with national parks for the purpose of scientific study.

to himself when he committed suicide by setting himself on fire in the East Texas town of Grand Saline, Texas. He also drew attention to how the United Methodist Church (UMC) treated gays and lesbians by going on a hunger strike years earlier. He had aligned himself with several progressive, liberal and left-leaning causes throughout his life, leaving behind a typed letter urging the community of Grand Saline and the United States to repent for its racism. Biography Moore was born near Grand Saline and grew up in a town he described as a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that was blighted by racial discrimination. As a 10-year-old boy, he was deeply affected by accounts of people of color who had been brutally decapitated and had their heads placed on poles. Moore graduated from Tyler Junior College in 1954,A Service of Worship in Memory of the life and ministry of Rev. Charles Robert Moore, June 12, 2014, Faith Presbyterian Church, Austin, Texas then earned a B.A. degree from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1956 and a B.D. from Perkins School of Theology at SMU in 1956. He served in various Texas churches from 1953 until 1965 when he began post doctorate studies at Harvard Divinity School and Boston University. In the mid 1960s he moved to Chicago and began working for the Ecumenical Institute. This work took him to Africa, Brussels, India, and the Middle East. In 1990, Moore led Grace Methodist church in Austin, Texas, where he opened the doors to gays and lesbians. Protests While serving in San Antonio in 1972, Moore organized a meeting of Methodists to bring attention to the injustice of the Vietnam War. When the United Methodist bishops held a worldwide meeting in Austin in 1995, Moore's 15-day hunger strike ended only after the bishops acknowledged their role in contributing to stigma and ostracism of gays and lesbians. Moore helped organize the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (TCADP), which operates as a resource for those opposed to capital punishment. In 2000 he received awards from Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and TCADP. Death On June 23, 2014, Moore drove from his home in the Dallas suburb of Allen, Texas, to Grand Saline, a notorious sundown town about 75 miles east of Dallas. He parked his car in a shopping center parking lot on the far eastern part of the city. He then proceeded to pour gasoline on himself and set himself ablaze. Bystanders retrieved a store fire extinguisher and put out the blaze. He was taken by helicopter to Parkland Hospital in Dallas, and died there later that night. Explanation of death Moore left a typed note on his car stating he was born in Grand Saline and grew up around racial discrimination. The note explained that his act was a protest of what he saw as Grand Saline's long-standing racist culture. He said that the Grand Saline community shunned blacks and resorted to violence, including hangings, burnings, and decapitations. Declaring himself heartbroken, he lamented that America and Grand Saline had never really repented for the atrocities of slavery. Moore himself predicted that some would judge him insane. His papers and personal notes were released to the media, revealing his thinking and intentions. In the weeks leading up to his death, he wrote that his mental and physical health were good, but he was frustrated that he had been unable to bring about the social change he felt was so urgent. In the notes, Moore sometimes criticizes himself harshly for not acting more decisively on social justice issues. He wanted the act of his death to get more people to care about gay rights, the death penalty, civil rights, and racism. Initially he had planned his self-immolation on the SMU campus on June 19, the annual Juneteenth commemoration, because of the decision by SMU to house the George W. Bush Presidential Center. He changed his mind and went to Grand Saline four days later to carry out his plan. After reading Moore's notes, family members concluded that his final act was an extension of his lifelong commitment to social justice. An in-depth article in Texas Monthly examining Moore's death quoted family members, \\"He wanted his death to count for something.\\" References External links * Man on Fire, a 2018 documentary film chronicling Moore's life, his self-immolation, and the pervasive racism that led to his act of protest Category:1934 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Methodist ministers Category:American clergy Category:Hunger strikers Category:Suicides by self-immolation Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Male suicides Category:People from Grand Saline, Texas ","title":"Charles R.

The bid is headquartered in Rockhampton, Queensland. The bid team is hoping to secure Gorden Tallis as their coach. History and bid region Rugby League has been played in Central Queensland for over a century and is currently represented in the Queensland Cup by the Central Queensland Capras. The bid aims to unite a region from Bundaberg in the south to Mackay in the north and west to the state border. Local government areas in the bid region, such as Rockhampton Regional Council and Mackay Regional Council also officially support the bid. Home Ground Rockhampton's largest stadium is Browne Park and is home to the Capras. The bid has proposed that the club will play out of a new stadium to be built in Rockhampton, called CQ Stadium & Convention Centre. In July 2013 both sides of government promised a detailed design and feasibility study for a new stadium to be conducted and carried out before 2015. Bid Chairman Geoff Murphy has suggested that while the club will call Rockhampton home, both trials and premiership matches could be taken to other cities in the CQ NRL bid region, such as Mackay, when the team is admitted to the NRL. Junior Development Program Since 2011 the bid has run junior development camps and organised matches against Northern Pride junior teams, as well as matches against Marsden State High School in Brisbane and Keebra Park State High School on the Gold Coast. Community A public petition was launched in June 2009 and had reached 30,000 signatures by 2011. The bid also envisions the development of feeder teams in the Queensland Cup, such as Bundaberg, to provide direct pathways for juniors to progress into the NRL team. In 2011 CQ University partnered with the bid to become a major sponsor and in return will provide academic scholarships for players.

An area of disturbed weather near the Philippines was first observed on November 1\\\\. Following an increase in organization, the disturbance was designated as a tropical cyclone on November 4\\\\. Moving west, Tess steadily strengthened due to favorable conditions aloft. During the evening of November 5, Tess was estimated to have achieved its highest intensity, with winds of . Rapid weakening then ensured as Tess neared Vietnam, and after making landfall in the country on November 6, Tess dissipated the next day. Tropical Storm Tess and its precursor disturbance brought extensive flooding to much of the central Philippines. In Cebu, eight people were killed, and many homes and bridges were destroyed. The province of Palawan, a geographically isolated island from the rest of the country, suffered severe damage due to mudslides and flooding. There, 75 people were confirmed to have died, and 600 others were later presumed to have perished. In the suburbs of the capital city of Manila, 3,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to rising floodwaters. In all, there were a total of 686 deaths in the country. Nationwide, 144,136 people were evacuated to shelter, and 86 homes were destroyed, with 430 others receiving damage. Damage in the country totaled $11.38 million (1988 USD). In addition to the impact on the Philippines, Tess killed 37 people and inflicted $11 million in damage in Vietnam. Meteorological history In what would later become the second of two tropical cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988, an area of disturbed weather was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November 1. Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Welpring. Over the next three days, the disturbance tracked southwest while embedded within the northeasterly flow of the winter monsoon. After passing through the Visayas island group and emerging into the open water of the Sulu Sea, the system began to increase in organization. At 17:30 UTC on November 3, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. At 00:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression, citing satellite intensity estimates of , while the JMA upgraded it to tropical storm intensity. At this time, the tropical cyclone was centered south of Manila. Almost immediately after the upgrades, the storm's track shifted from southwestward to westward in response to a trough weakening to the north; this also weakened the pressure gradient between the trough and a nearby ridge starting on November 4\\\\. In turn, wind shear decreased and allowed the storm to intensify. Following an increase in satellite intensity estimates, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, and named it Tess, at 06:00 UTC. As the storm tracked over the South China Sea, strengthening continued. On November 5, the JMA upgraded Tess into a severe tropical storm. At midday, the JTWC estimated that Tess attained typhoon intensity, which was also its maximum intensity of . At 18:00 UTC on November 5, the JMA reported that Tess attained winds of and a barometric pressure of , its peak intensities in terms of both winds and pressure. Data from the JTWC suggests the storm weakened rapidly as it approached Vietnam. At 00:00 UTC on November 6, the JTWC stopped tracking the system; however, intensity estimates from the JMA had only decreased slightly during this time, and continued to classify Tess as a severe tropical storm. Tess then moved across the Mekong River delta, moving ashore midday about east-northeast of Ho Chi Minh City. By early November 7, the JMA stopped tracking the system. Impact and aftermath By moving across the central Philippines in its formative phases, Tess became the second tropical cyclone to impact the island group within two weeks; the first was Typhoon Ruby. At least nine people were killed in the provinces of Cebu and Bukidnon, where the storm also rendered 600 people homeless. Eight of those deaths occurred in Cebu. There, the storm brought flash flooding that destroyed numerous bridges and homes. Palawan Island, a rugged, sparsely populated island chain isolated from the rest of the country, sustained widespread destruction from Tess, primarily due to flooding and landslides. On the island, the town of Rizal sustained the worst damage from the storm. There, 23 fatalities occurred. The island's north-south coastal road was covered in of water. By November 10, 75 people were confirmed to have been killed throughout Palawan, with 600 others subsequently listed as missing by the Philippine Red Cross. The missing were presumed dead by December 14. In part because the water level was already above normal due to Ruby, Laguna Lake, situated on the southeastern side of the capital city of Manila, overflowed its banks. This forced 3,000 people, mainly in the suburbs of Pasig, Taguig and Pateros, to evacuate their homes. Outside Palawan Island, Tess only resulted in 11 fatalities only in the island chain, all due to flooding. Nationwide, the storm was blamed for 686 deaths. Additionally, 144,136 people or 28,824 families were evacuated to shelters as a result of the flooding. A total of 86 homes were destroyed and 430 others were damaged. Furthermore, damage to private property totaled $7.58 million (1988 USD). In addition, the storm caused $3.8 million in damage to agriculture. Overall, the nation suffered $11.38 million damage due to the cyclone. Even though the storm had weakened drastically by this time, Tess killed 37 people in Vietnam, destroyed thousands of homes, and inflicted $11 million in damage. Following Tess, Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited the provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated to the north of Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project. A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone to hit the archipelago in two weeks.

Construction on the project began in 2015; partial completion is expected by mid-2021, and final completion by 2024.Garfield, Leanna (April 6, 2017) \\"11 billion-dollar mega-projects that will transform New York City by 2035\\" Business Insider Context =Seward Park Urban Renewal Area= Site of the Essex Crossing, with the Blue Tower in the background, Essex Street Market to the left, and the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets in the foreground. All of the buildings in the foreground will be replaced in the project (photo: September 2013) Historically, the Lower East Side was an immigrant neighborhood, including Germans, Irish, Italians, and Hispanics; Essex Crossing was envisioned during the neighborhood's period of gentrification,Mele, Christopher. ‚ÄúSelling of the Lower East Side: Culture, Real Estate, and Resistance in New York City.‚Äù Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000. but this part of the Lower East Side is an area alternatively known as SPURA, which has been up for development since the mid-1960s. SPURA covers five vacant plots of land acquired as part of a 1965 urban renewal plan, near Delancey and Grand Streets. These sites were originally part of the broader Seward Park Urban Renewal Area, a federal program designed to tear down several tenements to develop low-income housing, called the Cooperative Village. Some original SPURA land was eventually developed, but five lots remain vacant to this day. SPURA was the largest tract of undeveloped New York City-owned land in Manhattan south of 96th Street, but debate over what would be the \\"appropriate redevelopment\\" of SPURA had stalled the process and kept it undeveloped. In 1967, New York City leveled 20 acres on the southern side of Delancey Street and removed more than 1,800 low-income, largely Puerto Rican families, with a promise that they would return to new low-income apartments when they were built. However, political corruption abounded, and the new apartments were never built. The competing forces within the neighborhood debated whether the SPURA area should be used to develop affordable housing within Manhattan Community Board 3; or be developed as mixed-use ‚Äì low- and middle-income as well as commercial; or whether it should be all large commercial retail use. This debate is often waged in the community halls of local public school auditoriums and other city meeting places, in newspaper columns, at co-op board meetings, and at private strategy sessions in individual homes. During the Koch administration that ended in 1989, the city contracted with Sam LeFrak to build, but massive divided opposition caused it to be withdrawn. The land still sat vacant in 2012. In January and February 2011, the local community board took the issue of SPURA's development up and came to a community consensus that the area will be built to accommodate mixed use of low-income housing, commercial properties/retail spaces, and market-value homes. The Board, community and city planners and public officials were to finalize the plans for development. On October 11, 2012, the New York City Council approved the project, then still referred to as SPURA, in a unanimous vote. On September 18, 2013, the then Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled a definite plan for the Essex Crossing project. =Start of construction= In June 2014, demolition of structures in the area commenced making way for the development. On August 2, 2014, it was revealed that a municipal parking lot at Broome and Essex Streets would be closed for soil testing and planning of the future Warhol museum. Groundbreaking for the crossing was said to come as early as spring 2015, though a definite groundbreaking timeline had not been published. Another parking lot was closed on December 31, this time a private one on Suffolk Street. Final designs for Essex Crossing were to be released on January 14, 2015. The Essex Street Market and a firehouse on Broome Street were to be demolished by early 2015. Description Upon its completion, it will comprise the Essex Street Market, restaurants, office space, a movie theater, and a park. Ultimately, Essex Crossing, split among ten sequentially numbered lots, will be built on the east side of Essex Street between Stanton and Delancey Streets (lots 8, 9, and 10); the municipal parking lot at Broome and Essex Streets (lot 7); an area bounded by Attorney, Broome, Essex, and Delancey Streets (lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6); and a block bounded by Grand, Clinton, Broome, and Suffolk Streets (lot 5). =Existing= Housing Existing Seward Park towers There are both public housing and condominiums in the area. In the SPURA area, public housing is operated by the Seward Park Housing Corporation, part of the Cooperative Village, located in the triangle between Grand Street and East Broadway, and abuts Seward Park. The buildings, designed by Herman Jessor, were finished in 1959.Bagli, Charles V. \\"Spotlight on Architect's Work In Wake of a Garage Collapse\\", The New York Times, January 19, 1999. Condominiums include the Blue Tower at 105 Norfolk Street, designed by Bernard Tschumi, opened in 2007 with 32 condominium apartments over 16 stories, a ground floor commercial space occupied by the Thierry Goldberg Gallery, and a roof terrace for residents on the third floor, using a common setup with commercial space at the ground floor with residential space above. The Blue Tower is not LEED certified. The tower had a characteristic slant that sets it apart from other buildings in the vicinity. Essex Street Market Essex Street Market, pre-reconstruction The Essex Street Market is an indoor retail market, one of a number of such facilities built in the 1930s under the administration of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia at 120 Essex Street, north of Delancey Street. The Essex Street Market, a group of markets constructed in the 1940s to reduce pushcart congestion on the narrow streets of the Lower East Side, is operated and managed by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC). In September 2013, it was announced that the market would be integrated into the Essex Crossing. The new building, along Essex Street on the south side of Delancey, will have 39 stalls and two restaurants. It was originally planned to open in 2018, but was later pushed back to April 2019, then to May 13, 2019. Essex Street municipal parking lot An existing parking garage at 107 Essex Street, north of Delancey Street, is also being renovated as part of the redevelopment plan. Originally slated to be converted into housing under an idea by Councilwoman Margaret Chin, it was dropped from the project and later put back on. =New buildings= Broome Street Gardens Part of the development includes a new public park on Broome Street between Suffolk and Clinton streets, spanning . The park, which is part of the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area, will start construction in early 2015 with an estimated completion of 2017. The park, contrary to other city parks, will only be 35% planted, with open spaces, signage, bike racks, and skateboard-proof park benches. It will include a playground for toddlers, in anticipation of a new primary school nearby. Lowline park The large trolley terminal under Delancey and Essex Streets has sat unused for 60 years, and a new park is being proposed there.Foderaro, Lisa W. \\"Inspired by High Line, Park Is Envisioned With Sights Set Low\\", The New York Times, November 21, 2011; accessed November 21, 2011. The project was first proposed in 2011 and has quickly generated widespread media attention. In 2012, the project successfully raised over $150,000 from 3,300 backers on Kickstarter to create a full-scale exhibition of the solar lighting technology. The project was named by Mashable as one of the top Kickstarter projects of that year. If completed, it would have been within the Essex Crossing development, though the project was indefinitely postponed in February 2020 due to a lack of funding. Housing thumb Half of the 1,000 units to be constructed at the crossing will be affordable housing. While five buildings will be completed as early as 2018, the entire housing complex will not be completed until 2021. Housing on lots 1, 2, 5, and 6 will be completed first, in fall 2015, followed by Lot 8 in fall 2016 and lots 3 and 4 in spring 2017; lots 9 and 10 will be finished last, between 2019 and 2022. Most of the housing will be on lots 1, 2, 5, and 6, which will start construction in early 2015. They will have a combined 556 units, including 311 affordable units and 100 for senior residents. There will also be 155 condominiums, with 37 or 38 of them affordable. Retail Trader Joe's opened a location on the first floor and basement of 145 Clinton Street, at the northwest corner with Grand Street, on October 19, 2018. The space on the building's second floor, immediately above Trader Joe's, is occupied by a Target store, which opened in August 2018. Movie theater In October 2014, a movie theater, with 14 screens, was announced. Located at Delancey and Essex Streets, and operated by Regal Cinemas, it includes digital cinema projectors and recliners with padded footrests, among other amenities, as well as an RPX Regal Premium Experience auditorium and bar. Scheduled to begin construction in spring 2015 for completion by 2018, the theater opened on April 6, 2019.

Designed by architecture firm Gensler, the building has galleries, media labs, classrooms, darkrooms, shooting studios, a shop, caf√©, research library and public event spaces.Nancy Kenney (January 22, 2020), International Center of Photography prepares to move into a far bigger home in New York The Art Newspaper. = Canceled projects = Warhol museum A annex to the main Pittsburgh museum, the Warhol building was scheduled to open by 2017. It would have taken up a parking lot as well as the 75 Essex Street building, a building at the corner of Broome and Essex Streets that some locals are fighting to have landmarked. It was reported that Taconic offered 75 Essex Street's owners a huge sum to redevelop the building as part of the museum. Plans for this museum were canceled in March 2013. Political controversy The SPURA area, now the Essex Crossing's site, was kept empty, except for parking lots, since 1967 due to suspected political alliances. In 1977, then- to-be-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty (Met Council) head William \\"Bill\\" Rapfogel accompanied then-mayor Edward Koch through the area, promising to turn some of barren land on Delancey Street's south side into a never-delivered development that had displaced more than 1,800 residents a decade before. Rapfogel and Silver were accused of promoting specific plans for favored developers, which would maintain the area's Jewish identity, at the expense of other communities. They opposed a 1970s plan for affordable housing, which would have changed the demographics of the neighborhood and brought in more Chinese and Hispanic residents. Silver instead proposed a shopping center with no housing for the site in the 1980s. In the 1990s, they proposed a ‚Äúbig box‚Äù store, like Costco, to be built by Bruce Ratner, a developer. Ratner hired Rapfogel's eldest son in 2007, and Silver employed Rapfogel's wife as his chief of staff. Ratner also helped raise $1 million for the Met Council.

The Man in Possession is a 1931 American pre-Code romantic comedy film starring Robert Montgomery, Charlotte Greenwood and Irene Purcell, and based on the play of the same name by H. M. Harwood. The black sheep of a family finds himself falling in love with the wealthy woman his brother is seeking to marry. Plot Raymond Dabney (Montgomery) returns to a mixed reaction from his middle-class family in London after serving a sentence at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs for stealing a motorcar. His mother (Beryl Mercer) and the family servant (Maude Eburne) are delighted to see him, but his father (C. Aubrey Smith) and brother Claude (Reginald Owen) are less so. His father is particularly disappointed in him, having sent him to Cambridge. The two men offer him ¬£500 to leave the country and never return; it seems Claude is engaged to a rich widow, and they are anxious to avoid any scandal that might endanger the marriage. Raymond turns it down, however, and departs the same day. He obtains work as a sheriff's officer, helping a bailiff serve a writ on Crystal Wetherby (Purcell), a woman in serious debt, taking possession of her property. The bailiff instructs him to remain in Crystal's mansion to keep an eye on the seized property until the next day, but also to provide any reasonable assistance to the woman. Crystal and her sole remaining servant, Clara (Greenwood), have him take the place of the departed butler. Then Crystal mentions the name of her fianc√©, none other than Claude Dabney. Claude is bringing his parents to dinner that night to meet her. The situation is awkward for all the Dabneys. Meanwhile, Crystal's admirer, the wealthy and generous (if disreputable) Sir Charles Cartwright (Alan Mowbray), shows up. Crystal has carefully kept the news of her engagement from him. She manages to get the jealous man to leave without him meeting her dinner guests. Before Claude leaves, he informs Crystal that her butler has a crooked past (without revealing they are brothers), but she refuses to discharge him (without revealing he is actually in possession of the premises). To complicate matters even further, that night Raymond seduces a willing Crystal. The next morning, Raymond prepares Crystal's breakfast in bed, though Clara insists on taking it up to her. When Crystal removes the cover, she sees that the bacon has been arranged to spell the word \\"LOVE\\". Clara picks up Crystal's undergarments scattered around the room, noting that her chemise is torn. Crystal does not correct Clara's incredulous assumption that it was Claude who ripped it. Raymond then proceeds to sabotage Crystal's other relationships. When Sir Charles arrives, Raymond informs him of her engagement, causing the latter to tear up a check for ¬£1000 he was about to give Crystal. Claude then offers his brother ¬£1000 to leave England forever; Raymond insists on being paid an additional ¬£200 for immediate expenses. Then Raymond shows Claude the writ, proving Crystal is not the wealthy woman she pretends to be. Panic-stricken, Claude tells Raymond to reveal to her that they are brothers (in order to break off the engagement without being sued for breach of promise) and hastily departs. Sir Charles returns, having discovered that his love for Crystal is too strong, but she declines his proposal of marriage. When the bailiff shows up, Raymond pays off the outstanding debt, collects his wages, and informs Crystal that they can be married on the ship taking them to a fresh start in a new country. She reminds him of her past, but he is undeterred. She then happily embraces him. Cast * Robert Montgomery as Raymond Dabney * Charlotte Greenwood as Clara * Irene Purcell as Crystal Wetherby * C.

History  Mash Brewing opened in April 2006, one of a number of craft breweries operating in the Swan Valley. Owned by Brad Cox, the brewery is located behind the main bar and the open working area allows customers to view the brewing activities. Mash Brewing has a 12-hectolitre brewhouse. The foundation Head Brewer was Dan Turley. In mid-2008 the company opened Mash Bunbury, a scaled-down version of their Swan Valley operation, including a 100-litre microbrewery that produces seasonal beers for the venue, served on tap together with the full range of Mash beers. In November 2011 a new team, headed by brewer Charlie Hodgson, was brought in and set about reinventing the Brewery's beer range. The current brewing team are Kail Bryce and Lachlan Kirkwood, brewing Mash's core range as well as seasonal and limited releases.https://www.mashbrewing.com.au/core-range/  Awards  2018 AIBA ‚Äì Silver Medal ‚Äì Copy Cat 2018 AIBA ‚Äì Silver Medal ‚Äì The Guvnor 2018 AIBA ‚Äì Bronze Medal ‚Äì Little NEIPA 2017 AIBA -

Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials‚Äîincluding canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments‚Äîusually in a three- or four-sided shape. A sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack‚Äîits angle with respect to the apparent wind. Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or point of sail. On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface‚Äîjust as an airplane wing generates lift‚Äîwhich predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion. The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind. Sails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet. In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. Battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points. Other non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite- rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article. Rigs Sailing craft employ two types of rig, the square rig and the fore-and-aft rig. The square rig carries the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal spars, which are perpendicular or square, to the keel of the vessel and to the masts. These spars are called yards and their tips, beyond the last stay, are called the yardarmsOxford English Dictionary. A ship mainly so rigged is called a square-rigger. The square rig is aerodynamically most efficient when running (sailing downwind). A fore-and-aft rig consists of sails that are set along the line of the keel rather than perpendicular to it. Vessels so rigged are described as fore-and- aft rigged. History Egyptian sailing ship, ca. 1422‚Äì1411 BCE Archaeological studies of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture ceramics show use of sailing boats from the sixth millennium BCE onwards. Excavations of the Ubaid period (c. 6000‚Äì4300 BCE) in Mesopotamia provides direct evidence of sailing boats. =Square rigs= Sails from ancient Egypt are depicted around 3200 BCE,The sea-craft of prehistory, p76, by Paul Johnstone, Routledge, 1980 where reed boats sailed upstream against the River Nile's current. Ancient Sumerians used square rigged sailing boats at about the same time, and it is believed they established sea trading routes as far away as the Indus valley. Greeks and Phoenicians began trading by ship by around 1200 BCE. =Crab claw rigs= Fijian voyaging outrigger boat with a crab claw sail The first sea-going sailing ships were developed by the Austronesian peoples from what is now Southern China and Taiwan. Their invention of catamarans, outriggers, and the highly-efficient bi-sparred triangular crab claw sails enabled their ships to sail for vast distances in open ocean. It led to the Austronesian Expansion at around 3000 to 1500 BC. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe. The proto-Austronesian words for sail, lay(r), and other rigging parts date to about 3000 BCE when this group began their Pacific expansion. Austronesian rigs were distinctive in that they had spars supporting both the upper and lower edges of the sails (and sometimes in between), in contrast to western rigs which only had a spar on the upper edge. The sails were also made from salt-resistant woven leaves, usually from pandan plants. Crab claw sails used with single-outrigger ships in Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar were intrinsically unstable when tacking leeward. To deal with this, Austronesians in these regions developed the shunting technique in sailing, in conjunction with uniquely reversible single- outriggers. In the rest of Austronesia, crab claw sails were mainly for double-outrigger (trimarans) and double-hulled (catamarans) boats, which remained stable even leeward. In western Island Southeast Asia, later square sails also evolved from the crab claw sail, the tanja and the junk rig, both of which retained the Austronesian characteristic of having more than one spar supporting the sail. Junk rigs were later adopted by the Chinese Song Dynasty in the 10th century CE from contact with Srivijayan trading ships (known as \\"Kunlun ships\\" in Chinese records). =Lateen rigs= Maldivian Baghlah with a fore-and-aft rig lateen rig In the Mediterranean, single-yarded lateen sails emerged by around the 2nd century CE.I. C. Campbell, \\"The Lateen Sail in World History\\" , Journal of World History (University of Hawaii), 6.1 (Spring 1995), p. 1‚Äì23 Marchaj, Czeslaw A. Sail Performance, Techniques to Maximize Sail Power, Revised Edition. London: Adlard Coles Nautical, 2003. Part 2 Aerodynamics of sails, Chapter 11 \\"The Sail Power of Various Rigs\\" Though its origin remains contentious, it is believed that it developed from early contact with Southeast Asian Austronesian trading ships in the Indian Ocean with crab claw sails.Shaffer, Lynda Norene (1996). Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500. M.E. Sharpe. The fore-and-aft rig began as a convention of southern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea: the generally gentle climate made its use practical, and in Italy a few centuries before the Renaissance it began to replace the square rig which had dominated all of Europe since the dawn of sea travel. Northern Europeans were resistant to adopting the fore-and-aft rig, despite having seen its use in the course of trade and during the Crusades. The Renaissance changed this: beginning in 1475, their use increased and within a hundred years the fore-and-aft rig was in common use on rivers and in estuaries in Britain, northern France, and the Low Countries, though the square rig remained standard for the harsher conditions of the open North Sea as well as for trans-Atlantic sailing. The lateen sail proved to have better upwind performance for smaller vessels. During the 16th-19th centuries other fore-and-aft sails were developed in Europe, such as the spritsail, gaff rig, jib, genoa, staysail, and Bermuda rig mainsail, improving the upwind sailing ability of European vessels. Aerodynamic forces Aerodynamic forces for two points of sail. Left-hand boat: Down wind‚Äîpredominant drag propels the boat with little heeling moment. Right-hand boat: Up wind (close-hauled)‚Äîpredominant lift both propels the boat and contributes to heel. angles of attack and resulting (idealized) flow patterns that provide propulsive lift. Aerodynamic forces on sails depend on wind speed and direction and the speed and direction of the craft. The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface) is called the \\"point of sail\\". The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the apparent wind ( VA)‚Äîthe wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into drag‚Äîthe force component in the direction of the apparent wind‚Äîand lift‚Äîthe force component normal (90¬∞) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force‚Äîresisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)‚Äîand a lateral force, resisted by the underwater foils, ice runners, or wheels of the sailing craft. For apparent wind angles aligned with the entry point of the sail, the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. For apparent wind angles behind the sail, lift diminishes and drag increases as the predominant component of propulsion. For a given true wind velocity over the surface, a sail can propel a craft to a higher speed, on points of sail when the entry point of the sail is aligned with the apparent wind, than it can with the entry point not aligned, because of a combination of the diminished force from airflow around the sail and the diminished apparent wind from the velocity of the craft. Because of limitations on speed through the water, displacement sailboats generally derive power from sails generating lift on points of sail that include close-hauled through broad reach (approximately 40¬∞ to 135¬∞ off the wind). Because of low friction over the surface and high speeds over the ice that create high apparent wind speeds for most points of sail, iceboats can derive power from lift further off the wind than displacement boats. ;Downwind sailing with a spinnaker File:Sailboat on broad reach with spinnaker.jpgSpinnaker set for a broad reach, mobilizing both lift and drag.

(1913) Mer : la Mer Dans la Nature, la Mer et l'Homme, Paris: Librairie Larousse, p. 213 Each rig is configured in a sail plan, appropriate to the size of the sailing craft. A sail plan is a set of drawings, usually prepared by a naval architect which shows the various combinations of sail proposed for a sailing ship. Sail plans may vary for different wind conditions‚Äîlight to heavy. Both square-rigged and fore-and-aft rigged vessels have been built with a wide range of configurations for single and multiple masts. Types of sail that can be part of a sail plan can be broadly classed by how they are attached to the sailing craft: *To a stay ‚Äì Sails attached to stays, include jibs, which are attached to forestays and staysails, which are mounted on other stays (typically wire cable) that support other masts from the bow aft. *To a mast ‚Äì Fore-and-aft sails directly attached to the mast at the luff include gaff-rigged quadrilateral and Bermuda triangular sails. *To a spar ‚Äì Sails attached to a spar include both square sails and such fore-and-aft quadrilateral sails as lug rigs, junk and spritsails and such triangular sails as the lateen, and the crab claw. *To a halyard ‚Äì Spinnakers are the predominant sail supported solely by a halyard. High-performance yachts, including the International C-Class Catamaran, have used or use rigid wing sails, which perform better than traditional soft sails but are more difficult to manage. A rigid wing sail was used by Stars and Stripes, the defender which won the 1988 America's Cup, and by USA-17, the challenger which won the 2010 America's Cup. USA 17's performance during the 2010 America's Cup races demonstrated a velocity made good upwind of over twice the wind speed and downwind of over 2.5 times the wind speed and the ability to sail as close as 20 degrees off the apparent wind. Shape Corners and sides of a quadrilateral fore-and-aft sail The shape of a sail is defined by its edges and corners in the plane of the sail, laid out on a flat surface. The edges may be curved, either to extend the sail's shape as an airfoil or to define its shape in use. In use, the sail becomes a curved shape, adding the dimension of depth or draft. *Edges ‚Äì The top of all sails is called the head, the leading edge is called the luff on fore-and-aft sails and on windward leech symmetrical sails, the trailing edge is the leech, and the bottom edge is the foot. The head is attached at the throat and peak to a gaff, yard, or sprit. For a triangular sail the head refers to the topmost corner. :A fore-and-aft triangular mainsail achieves a better approximation of a wing form by extending the leech aft, beyond the line between the head and clew on an arc called the roach, rather than having a triangular shape. This added area would flutter in the wind and not contribute to the efficient airfoil shape of the sail without the presence of battens. Offshore cruising mainsails sometimes have a hollow leech (the inverse of a roach) to obviate the need for battens and their ensuing likelihood of chafing the sail. The roach on a square sail design is the arc of a circle above a straight line from clew to clew at the foot of a square sail, which allows the foot of the sail to clear stays coming up the mast, as the sails are rotated from side to side. *Corners ‚Äì The names of corners of sails vary, depending on shape and symmetry. In a triangular sail, the corner where the luff and the leech connect is called the head. On a square sail, the top corners are head cringles, where there are grommets, called cringles. On a quadrilateral sail, the peak is the upper aft corner of the sail, at the top end of a gaff or other spar. The throat is the upper forward corner of the sail, at the bottom end of a gaff or other spar. Gaff-rigged sails, and certain similar rigs, employ two halyards to raise the sails: the throat halyard raises the forward, throat end of the gaff, while the peak halyard raises the aft, peak end. :The corner where the leech and foot connect is called the clew on a fore-and-aft sail. On a jib, the sheet is connected to the clew; on a mainsail, the sheet is connected to the boom (if present) near the clew. Clews are the lower two corners of a square sail. Square sails have sheets attached to their clews like triangular sails, but the sheets are used to pull the sail down to the yard below rather than to adjust the angle it makes with the wind. The corner where the leech and the foot connect is called the clew. The corner on a fore- and-aft sail where the luff and foot connect is called the tack and, on a mainsail, is located where the boom and mast connect. :In the case of a symmetrical spinnaker, each of the lower corners of the sail is a clew. However, under sail on a given tack, the corner to which the spinnaker sheet is attached is called the clew, and the corner attached to the spinnaker pole is referred to as the tack. On a square sail underway, the tack is the windward clew and also the line holding down that corner. *Draft ‚Äì Those triangular sails that are attached to both a mast along the luff and a boom along the foot have depth, called draft, which results from the luff and foot being curved, rather than straight as they are attached to those spars. Draft creates a more efficient airfoil shape for the sail. Draft can also be induced in triangular staysails by adjustment of the sheets and the angle from which they reach the sails. Material Laminated sail with Kevlar and carbon fibers. Sail characteristics derive, in part, from the design, construction and the attributes of the fibers, which are woven together to make the sail cloth. There are several key factors in evaluating a fiber for suitability in weaving a sail-cloth: initial modulus, breaking strength (tenacity), creep, and flex strength. Both the initial cost and its durability of the material define its cost-effectiveness over time. Traditionally, sails were made from flax or cotton canvas. Materials used in sails, as of the 21st century, include nylon for spinnakers‚Äîwhere light weight and elastic resistance to shock load are valued‚Äîand a range of fibers, used for triangular sails, that includes Dacron, aramid fibers‚Äîincluding Kevlar, and other liquid crystal polymer fibers‚Äîincluding Vectran. Woven materials, like Dacron, may specified as either high or low tenacity, as indicated, in part by their denier count (a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers). Construction Cross-cut genoa jib with sail components. Conventional sails comprise panels, which are most often stitched together, other times adhered. There are two basic configurations, cross-cut and radial. Cross-cut sails have the panels sewn parallel to one another, often parallel to the foot of the sail, and are the least expensive of the two sail constructions. Triangular cross-cut sail panels are designed to meet the mast and stay at an angle from either the warp or the weft (on the bias) to allow stretching along the luff, but minimize strutting on the luff and foot, where the fibers are aligned with the edges of the sail. Radial sails have panels that \\"radiate\\" from corners in order to efficiently transmit stress and are typically higher-performance than cross- cut sails. A bi-radial sail has panels radiating from two of three corners; a tri-radial sail has panels radiating from all three corners. Mainsails are more likely to be bi-radial, since there is very little stress at the tack, whereas head sails (spinnakers and jibs) are more likely to be tri-radial, because they are tensioned at their corners. Higher-performance sails may be laminated, constructed directly from multiple plies of filaments, fibers, taffetas, and films‚Äîinstead of woven textiles‚Äîand adhered together. Molded sails are laminated sails formed over a curved mold and adhered together into a shape that does not lie flat. Conventional sail panels are sewn together. Sails are tensile structures, so the role of a seam is to transmit a tensile load from panel to panel. For a sewn textile sail this is done through thread and is limited by the strength of the thread and the strength of the hole in the textile through which it passes. Sail seams are often overlapped between panels and sewn with zig-zag stitches that create many connections per unit of seam length. Whereas textiles are typically sewn together, other sail materials may be ultrasonically welded‚Äîa technique whereby high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld. It is commonly used for plastics, and especially for joining dissimilar materials. Sails feature reinforcements of fabric layers where lines attach at grommets or cringles. A bolt rope may be sewn onto the edges of a sail to reinforce it, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in the luff foil of a roller- furling jib. They may have stiffening features, called battens, that help shape the sail, when full length, or just the roach, when present. They may have a variety of means of reefing them (reducing sail area), including rows of short lines affixed to the sail to wrap up unused sail, as on square and gaff rigs, or simply grommets through which a line or a hook may pass, as on Bermuda mainsails. Fore-and-aft sails may have tell-tales‚Äîpieces of yarn, thread or tape that are affixed to sails‚Äîto help visualize airflow over their surfaces. Running rigging Running rigging on a sailing yacht: 1\\\\. Main sheet 2\\\\. Jib sheet 3\\\\. Boom vang 4\\\\. Downhaul 5\\\\. Jib halyard Square sail edges and corners (top). Running rigging (bottom). The lines that attach to and control sails are part of the running rigging and differ between square and fore-and-aft rigs. Some rigs shift from one side of the mast to the other, e.g. the dipping lug sail and the lateen. The lines can be categorized as those that support the sail, those that shape it, and those that control its angle to the wind. =Fore-and-aft rigged vessels= Fore- and-aft rigged vessels have rigging that supports, shapes, and adjusts the sails to optimize their performance in the wind, which include the following lines: *Supporting ‚Äì Halyards raise sails and control luff tension. Topping lifts hold booms and yards aloft. On a gaff sail, brails run from the leech to the spar to facilitate furling. *Shaping ‚Äì Barber haulers adjust a spinnaker/jib sheeting angle inboard at right angles to the sheet with a ring or clip on the sheet attached to cordage which is secured and adjusted via fairlead and cam cleat. Kicking straps/boom vangs control a boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting downward force mid-boom. Cunninghams tighten the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. Downhauls lower a sail or a yard and can adjust the tension on the luff of a sail. Outhauls control the foot tension of a boom- footed sail. *Adjusting angle to the wind ‚Äì Sheets control angle of attack with respect to the apparent wind, the amount of leech \\"twist\\" near the head of the sail, and the foot tension of loose-footed sails. A preventer attaches to the end of the boom from a point near the mast to prevent an accidental gybe. Guys control spinnaker pole angle with respect to the apparent wind. =Square-rigged vessels= Square-rigged vessels require more controlling lines than fore-and-aft rigged ones, including the following. *Supporting ‚Äì Halyards raise and lower the yards. Brails run from the leech to the spar to facilitate furling. Buntlines serve to raise the foot up for shortening sail or for furling. Lifts adjust the tilt of a yard, to raise or lower the ends off the horizontal. Leechlines run to the leech (outer vertical edges) of a sail and serve to pull the leech both in and up when furling. *Shaping ‚Äì Bowlines run from the leech forward towards the bow to control the weather leech, keeping it taut and thus preventing it from curling back on itself.

Early life Wright was born in Sandhurst, Berkshire, England, to Colonel Charles Wright and Harriet, n√©e Frere. In 1833, after officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Wright served with the 50th Regiment in New Zealand and on Norfolk Island. Career in Australia He sold his army commission in 1838 and trained as a surveyor in New South Wales. He joined the New South Wales Survey Department under Major Thomas Mitchell on 27 July 1838. Wright became Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Wellington District on 13 June 1843. In 1845, Wright ordered a number of troopers to deal with Aboriginal disturbances at the Macquarie Marshes and at Narromine. This force killed upwards of twenty people in these punitive expeditions. Thomas Mitchell travelled through this region about 12 months after the raids and described how most of the males of the tribe who lived in that area had been killed and many of the women taken to work as slaves on cattle stations. In late 1846, Wright was transferred to be Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Wimmera district. He was appointed chief commissioner of the goldfields on 1 May 1852 by Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe. Wright appointed as a member of the Victorian Legislative Council on 29 August 1853 and held that position until the original Council was abolished in March 1856. Wright was later appointed a police magistrate in the Jamieson district. This position he retained until he was appointed secretary for railways on 29 July 1862. Wright acted in this latter capacity for a number of years, giving general satisfaction to the successive responsible heads of the department, and proving himself an efficient public officer. When the previous sheriff of Victoria, Claud Farie, died in 1871, Wright, by his own request, was appointed to the position, which he continued to hold up to the time of his death. Wright married Mary Meek on 28 August 1866. He died in Brighton, Victoria at the home of George Higinbotham sometime on the morning of 1 February 1877 after dining there the previous night, and was buried in St Kilda Cemetery.

Predominantly serving the Township of York, the Township contracted the City of Toronto's TTC to run the line on its behalf. The initial route ran north from St. Clair Avenue, along Oakwood Avenue and turned west at Rogers Road, continuing to Dufferin Street. It was extended on August 29, 1925 to Bicknell Loop, located just east of Weston Road on Bicknell Avenue. After the Yonge Subway opened, in 1954, streetcars were extended eastward from Oakwood to St. Clair Station during rush hour. By 1974 many of the TTC's large fleet of PCC streetcars had worn out. The final Rogers Road streetcar travelled east to the St. Clair Carhouse on July 19, 1974. The route was replaced by the 63F Ossington trolley bus line beginning on July 21, 1974. According to Sean Marshall, closing the Rogers Road route was seen as a way to service other routes until the TTC could acquire new replacement vehicles.

This is a resident breeding species in woodlands in southern and eastern South Africa. Description The forest buzzard is very similar to the abundant summer migrant steppe buzzard Buteo buteo vulpinus, the head, the back and upperwings are brown, marked out with rufous edges to the feathers the amount of which varies between individuals. The chin is whitish and unmarked, the breast and belly are whitish but marked with a variable amount of brown spots, and the undertail coverts are plain whitish. There is variation and some adults show brown barring along the breast sides and the belly while all but the palest birds show a distinctive white ‚ÄòU‚Äô mark in the middle of the otherwise blotched abdomen. The underwings are white, with a reddish-brown tinge on the lesser underwing coverts and a dark comma shaped mark at the tip of primary coverts . The plumage on the thighs are uniformly reddish-brown, and the axillary feathers are white with brown barring. The upper tail is brown, washed with reddish-brown and the tail has some narrow dark brown bands with a broad dark brown subterminal band while the undertail bands can be indistinct. The body length is and the wingspan is . Distribution and movements The forest buzzard is endemic to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland where it occurs in an arc from the mountains of eastern Limpopo Province south through the Drakensberg of Kwazulu-Natal to the Western Cape. It as, at least, a partial migrant and seems to be a winter visitor (June‚ÄìAugust) in the Drakensberg of Eastern Cape northwards where there are no breeding records. Two birds ringed in the east (Kwazulu-Natal and Mpumalanga) were subsequently recovered in the south of South Africa having moved between . Habitat The forest buzzard, as its name implies, inhabits evergreen woodlands, including introduced eucalyptus and pines, whereas the steppe buzzard prefers more open habitats. However, habitat alone is not a good indicator for these species. Habits The forest buzzard hunts along the edge of or in the forest, where it is a sit and wait predator which pounces on prey from a perch. It has been recorded as preying on small mammals, birds up to the size of a turaco or a francolin, snakes, lizards, frogs, grasshoppers, wasps, beetles and scorpions. Its breeding biology is little known but it is thought to be territorial and monogamous. The nest is a large structure of sticks with an interior cup, lined with green leaves and sometimes with beard lichen Usnea spp. It is typically situated in the fork or lower branch of a tree in the forest interior, especially pines or eucalyptus but also indigenous trees such as small-leaved yellowwood (Afrocarpus falcatus). The two eggs are laid in the period from August‚ÄìNovember, with most being laid in September‚ÄìOctober. The eggs are laid asynchronously so the first laid hatches first and the older sibling is aggressive to its younger chick, preventing it from having food and if food is scarce the younger one will starve. They fledge at about 47 days old and become fully independent roughly four months. Taxonomy The forest buzzard forms part of a superspecies which includes the common buzzard and the Madagascar buzzard, as well as the mountain buzzard. The decision to treat forest buzzard and mountain buzzard as different species is based on differences in habitat, structure and plumages and the fact that the two taxa are not monophyletic. It is likely that the forest buzzard evolved from the steppe buzzard, which is a common wintering bird within the breeding range of the forest buzzard. The steppe buzzards is a generalist and breeds over a large area of the eastern Palearctic in a variety of habitats and winters widely in eastern and southern Africa, with a few non-breeding birds remaining in southern Africa over the northern summer. Conservation status The forest buzzard was formerly considered threatened in South Africa but the increase in exotic plantations and the species adaptation to breed in those plantations has allowed the population to increase. It is therefore treated as Near Threatened by the IUCN References * Clements, J. F., T. S. Schulenberg, M. J. Iliff, B.L. Sullivan, C. L. Wood, and D. Roberson. 2011.

O'Brien cast the film with a mixture of newcomers and faces familiar to genre audiences. He re-united with Maria del Mar, having first worked with her on the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Robocop: Prime Directives, which he co-wrote. The physically-demanding lead role of Jacinta was written specifically for Casey Hudecki, whose background as a stage actor and stunt performer made her ideal for the part. O'Brien was already a fan of David Hayter's work as both a writer and actor, and was delighted when he agreed to join the cast as the villainous Toby after reading the script. Synopsis Toby (David Hayter), Cally (Maria del Mar), and Jacinta (Casey Hudecki) are a fractious team of professional kidnappers who become lost while en route to deliver a valuable \\"package\\" -- two teenage girls, Kanako (Amanda Joy) and Suki (Samantha Wan) -- to their employer Mr. Arkadi (Frank Moore), a mysterious and terrifying mob boss. Tensions between the group reach critical mass after a botched escape attempt leaves Kanako dead, a failure that the notoriously cruel Arkadi will not forgive. As the survivors struggle to find an escape from the dire consequences awaiting them, they discover they have a bigger problem: Devil's Mile, the lonely stretch of highway they've found themselves on, seems to have no end. But when Kanako returns from the dead, transformed into a shape-shifting demonic entity (Shara Kim), they are forced to accept that the laws of not only time and space, but life and death, no longer apply. With no escape in sight, secrets are exposed, true identities are revealed, and one of them discovers that redemption can be had... at a terrible price.

Studies show consistently throughout the literature that most cannabis users self-report the experience of a slowed perception of time. In the laboratory, researchers have confirmed the effect of cannabis on the perception of time in both humans and animals. Studies have sought to explain how cannabis changes the internal clock. Matthew et al. (1998) looked at the cerebellum, positing a relationship between cerebellar blood flow and the distortion of time perception. Psychoactive effects Reports of the effects of cannabis on time perception can be found first in arts and literature, and then in medical reports and studies. Notable discussions of the effects occur in \\"Le Club des Hachichin\\" (1846), a work by French poet Th√©ophile Gautier, and in Les Paradis Artificiels (1860), a work by Charles Baudelaire. French physician Jacques-Joseph Moreau studied the effects of cannabis with the help of Gautier and other artists who experimented with hashish in the Club des Hashischins. Moreau published his findings in Hashish and Mental Illness: Psychological Studies (1846), noting that hashish caused \\"errors of time and space\\" and \\"time dragging\\". Later, in 1958, South African physician Frances Ames studied the effects of cannabis extract, noting the \\"disordered time perception\\" experienced by her subjects where \\"brief periods seemed immensely long\\".Jones, Helen Cc; Paul W. Lovinger (1985) The Marijuana Question and Science's Search for an Answer. Dodd Mead. . American poet Allen Ginsberg's \\"First Manifesto to End the Bringdown\\" (1966) noted that \\"the vast majority all over the world who have smoked the several breaths necessary to feel the effect, adjust to the strangely familiar sensation of Time slow-down.\\" (part two of article) American physician Jerome Groopman of Harvard Medical School, reported that the \\"perception of time is altered, generally with perceived time faster than clock time\\" in people who have ingested cannabis.Groopman, Jerome. (February 20, 2014). Marijuana: The High and the Low. The New York Review of Books. Retrieved August 9, 2014. Multiple review studies have confirmed these reports. In music Most notably, cannabis has had a long association among musicians and the music industry.Fachner, J√∂rg (July 2001). The Space between the Notes‚ÄîResearch on Cannabis and Music Perception. 11th IASPM Conference, Day Two (Subjectivities and Identities). pp. 308-319. Musicians and audiences who use cannabis often report the primary subjective effects as a distortion of time perception, which acts to augment both musical performance and music appreciation. Contrary to the effects produced by stimulant use, cannabis use is reported to give the performer or listener a subjective perception of time expansion, resulting in the overestimation of the passage of time. Dosage and method of ingestion may lessen or accentuate this effect. This subjective effect of time expansion is responsible for most of the anecdotal accounts in the literature. The effects of cannabis on musicians and those who listen to music are the subject of research in social pharmacology and music therapy. See also *Alice in Wonderland syndrome *Frederick T.

Opened in 1988, the mall features Kohl's, Sears, and Target, plus a go-kart track, indoor Laser Tag park, and movie theater. History Sierra Vista Mall was built in 1988 by the Hahn Company. While early plans called for both May Co. and Macy's stores, the original anchor stores were Mervyn's, Gottschalks, and Target. The mall was sold to Citicorp in 1995 and again to LandValue in 2002. A Sears was added in 1999 along with 10 other stores. In 2006, an outdoor lifestyle center section was added, including several restaurants and a 16-screen movie theater. Both Mervyn's and Gottschalks closed when the chains declared bankruptcy, in 2008 and 2009 respectively. causing a decrease in mall foot traffic. The Gottschalks store was intended to reopen in 2010 as a flagship for a failed revival of the chain. Kohl's replaced the Mervyn's in 2010, and an indoor go-kart track replaced part of the former Gottschalks in 2014. The mall was sold at a foreclosure auction for $39 million to LNR Property LLC in January 2015. No Surrender Laser Tag & Adventure Park moved from their location across town to the rest of the former Gottschalks store in 2017. In recent years, the mall has struggled to attract and retain tenants, with many major chains, including Sunglass Hut, PacSun, Foot Locker, and Wet Seal, leaving the mall. Some chains currently remaining include Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, New York & Company, Claire's, GameStop, and GNC. Multiple stores closed in the mall after the 2018 holiday season, including Sunglass Hut, Payless Shoesource, Blast Pizza, and Things Remembered, among other less known shops. In early 2020, the mall's Starbucks store closed, relocating to a freestanding drive-thru building across the street.

Born as Simson Alexander David in Brunswick, Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel as the tenth and youngest son of the \\"court jew\\" Alexander David, he grew up in a family with a great fortune and much political influence. His father was one of the most respected advisers of duke Charles (Karl) I., who needed the wealth of his \\"Kammeragent\\" or chamber agent for his luxury expenditures. With the death of his father (1765), young Simson inherited at least 10 000 gold taler, worth a few million dollars compared to the purchasing power of the present. Due to the financial inability and extravagance of his young mother Deborah Siemons, Simson was in danger of becoming bankrupt, even before he started as an adult his own business as an arts dealer. Only the intervention of his guardian saved him from early ruin. Under the name Alexander Daveson, he started his business in the year 1778. Even while he had famous customers like the duke of Brunswick, the scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, his income seems to have been very modest. Plans to produce a collection of copies of ancient engraved gems never became reality. Shortly after he was involved in a scandal at the very popular lottery of nearby Kassel (April 1779). The authorities of Kassel suspected Simson of fraud by consistently filling out lots after the drawings. The successor of the late duke of Brunswick, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, sent him to jail. Despite a detailed investigation, there was no incriminating evidence against Simson. Maybe the new duke only wanted to take revenge against the man who had sold many luxury goods to the former duke. While in jail at Brunswick, the only man, who helped Simson was the famous author and librarian Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who had great sympathies for outsiders of all kind. After his release Simson moved to Lessings home at Wolfenb√ºttel and stayed with him until the death of his benefactor (February 15, 1781). Lessing literally died \\"in the arms\\" of Simson, a fact, that was stubbornly disbelieved by the local public, who felt annoyed by it. Even after his death, Lessing was regularly criticized by authorities and Christian contemporaries for his contacts with Jews and \\"dubious people\\". Many years later, Simson asserted, that he helped Lessing with a lot of money, for the librarian got only a very modest salary from the duke. Soon after Lessings death, Simson travelled to England, where he stayed nine years. Since no detailed information or documents were found in the archives about these years of Simsons life, it is left to speculation, what kind of profession he had. Maybe he worked as a teacher, translator, travel companion or even Deklamator (recitator). He contended having been a student of the English language, trained by the prominent London publicist and philologist Samuel Johnson. Apparently Simson attended consistently British parliament sessions, being enthusiastic about the prominent orators, especially the liberal politician Charles James Fox, who openly sympathized with the American and later on with the French revolution. In October 1790 Simson came back to Germany, having become at that time a warm admirer of British culture and politics. He appeared at Hamburg first under the name Charles Lange, altering it shortly afterwards to Karl Julius Lange (apparently he was baptized). At the same time he adopted arbitrarily the title of a \\"professor of eloquence and English language\\". On the stage of the Hamburg theatre he tried to impress the audience with \\"attic entertainment\\", excerpts from Shakespeare plays and parliamentary debates. The spectators reacted with ridicule and laughter. Simson was mocked at for his small stature, his unmanageable hair, his bad teeth and his total inability to act. Nevertheless, Simson repeatedly tried to make a living as an actor. In Brunswick he was welcomed by the court and got a chance to perform with recitations in the local opera house, being applauded at least by the attending court members. After a short stay at Hanover and Vienna, where he published his first article about German language in the Wiener Zeitung, he went on a voyage to Switzerland. In 1794 he settled at Schweinfurt, Upper Franconia, where he married the sister of a Bayreuth official and wrote his first, two-volume book (√úber die Schweiz und die Schweizer/On Switzerland and the Swiss). It was widely discussed in the German and Swiss press, because Karl Julius Lange criticized the political system of Swiss cities like Zurich and Basel as undemocratic and inhuman. For a few months Lange worked as a journalist for the Englische Bl√§tter, a magazine about English politics, which was published at Erlangen. In 1796 he started his career as secret press agent of Karl- August von Hardenberg, the Prussian minister for the recently acquired Franconian principalities of Bayreuth and Ansbach. Hardenberg urgently needed a capable journalist for his propaganda against local and regional noblemen, who felt overruled by Prussia and who looked for some help in Vienna, where the Austrian Emperor took any chance to weaken Prussia. After several years as the much lauded editor-in-chief of the firmly democratic and liberal Deutsche Reichs- und Staatszeitung, Lange was sent to jail in May 1799 at Bayreuth for insulting the Emperor and the Austrian army. He had insinuated, that the Austrian authorities actively participated in the murder of three French diplomats at the Rastatt peace talks on April, 29, 1799. This allegation was never confirmed, but many eyewitnesses of the Rastatt events shared Simson's perception. Even while he had published his biweekly newspaper and all his personal articles with the secret assistance and subsidies of Hardenberg, the minister could not help him any longer, for the Berlin authorities had no interest in provoking the Austrian government. Lange twice fled from jail and emigrated to Altona, then a Danish town next to Hamburg with a very liberal press law. The next years he published a lot of articles and books about his life at Bayreuth, his sentence and stubbornly tried to get a pardon from the Prussian king. Not before 1804, when political circumstances had changed a lot, he could return to Prussia and moved to Berlin, becoming a journalist and propagandist of Karl August von Hardenberg again. He released a few magazines, who all had a very limited life span, for Simson again and again had troubles with the censorship (Der Nordische Merkur, Der deutsche Herold). With the outbreak of the Prussian-French war in early autumn 1806, Lange started a new paper Der Telegraph, the first German newspaper, which was published daily, including Sundays and holidays. For he changed his political views after the great victory of Napoleon at Jena and Auerstedt in a very spectacular way and in the short period of only two weeks from a Prussian patriot to an admirer of Napoleon and the French army, Lange became the most hated man in Berlin. He was blamed being corrupt, opportunistic and an impertinent, for he criticized the old Prussian regime as outdated and swore at Queen Luise, the most admired woman of that time in Prussia. After the withdrawal of the French from Berlin in December 1808, Lange went with the French army to Stettin and Erfurt, but his Telegraph was never published again after December 3, notwithstanding the personal will of Napoleon, who tried to revive the paper in January 1809. Lange worked as a consultant of the French army in the censorship of German newspapers. The Bamberg journalist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, later on a famous philosopher, and the author August von Kotzebue mocked Lange as a corrupt servant of the French. In the summer of 1811 Lange planned to write his memoirs in Frankfurt, but they were never published. According to newspaper articles of March 1813, Lange died at Minsk, presumably in the last months of 1812 or early 1813. There is no information about his job or even how he came there. According to a note from the Bayreuth city archive, he was a \\"civilian official\\" with the French army, who invaded Russia in 1812. His wife Caroline lived in poverty in Bayreuth and died January 1848. Writings *Alexander Daveson ( i.e. S. A.

Family background  Elwes was the second son of Henry Elwes of Colesbourne in Gloucestershire. His mother, Susan Hamond of Westacre, Norfolk, brought as her dowry the estate of Congham, eight miles from King's Lynn. It was here that Robert Elwes and his wife settled, building Congham House in the late 1850s. Today only one wing remains following the disastrous fire of November 1939. The fire has meant the loss of much valuable material relating to the Elwes family, but the surviving work of Robert Elwes, in the form of paintings and journals, provides an insight into the life of this Victorian country gentleman, exceptional not only for the extent of his travels, but also for the meticulousness of his artistic and literary records.  First world tour  Robert Elwes, Hong Kong Robert Elwes travelled extensively in his twenties and thirties, but in 1848 he embarked on a journey that was to take him round the world. Robert Elwes, aged 28, left England on 20 March 1848 on board the Eclipse. This voyage around the world took two years and three months, sailing on 10 different ships. He painted and sketched many scenes on his journey. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, having crossed the Atlantic from Tenerife in 30 days. He explored a little of Brazil and then sailed to Buenos Aires, Argentina. He crossed the Pampas on horseback, a journey of 1,000 miles, crossing the Andes by mule and up the Pacific coast to Lima. He sailed across the Pacific to Honolulu and Tahiti and was shipwrecked off Tasmania in September 1849. Rescued by sealers and taken to Hobart with a cargo of 500 sheep, he then travelled overland across Tasmania to Launceston where he sailed (nervously) for Australia. He continued his voyage, visiting and painting in Manila, Hong Kong, Canton and Shanghai and started towards home on 1 April 1850. His journey took him to Singapore, Penang, Bombay, Aden, the Red Sea and the Suez. From there, he travelled overland to Cairo (the Suez Canal was not built until 1859). His journey across the desert was in a horse-drawn \\"van\\" carrying six passengers. He sailed the most direct route home from Alexandria via Malta, Sicily, Naples and Genoa. From Genoa he travelled by \\"poste\\" to Milan and Chur and then by steamer down the Rhine to Rotterdam and thence to London where he arrived on 20 June 1850.  Family life  Soon after his return he married Mary Lucas, daughter of the rector of Edith Weston in Rutland. Over the next eighteen years she bore him ten children, five sons and five daughters. His eldest son Robert Hamond Elwes was the young lieutenant who met a glorious death at the Battle of Laing's Nek, South Africa, in 1881. His last cry of \\"Floreat Etona!\\" as he led the charge was immortalized in the Royal Academy painting of that title by Lady Butler. Following the death of the eldest son, the second son Arthur Elwes (1858-1907) inherited the Congham estate. The third son Gervase (1860-1895) was a tea and coffee planter in the Far East. The fourth son Richard (Dick) (1866-1841) ran the Elwes family tea estates at Kituldeniya in Ceylon and the youngest son Hugh (1869-1882) died whilst at school at Hunstanton. Of the five daughters, all of whom were talented watercolour painters, Evelyn (1852-1940) never married, Susan (1853-1934) married Gustavus Talbot who became Member of Parliament for Hemel Hempstead, and Milly (1855-1915) married Sir William ffolkes of neighbouring Hillington. Ysabel (1859-1934) married Henry Birkbeck of Westacre and in the 1930s created a village industry, Westacre Doll's House furniture, which was sold in the Burlington Arcade in London. The youngest daughter, Violet, inherited her father's talent and enthusiasm for travel, painting and sketching as she travelled to visit her brother in Ceylon and thence to Malaya, Burma and Indonesia. Violet Elwes became the first white woman to visit Lombok, Indonesia, all recorded in her sketch books and her diaries.  Second world tour  On the second major tour of which a published account survives, Robert Elwes was accompanied by his wife in 1865 to the West Indies, visiting Panama, Jamaica, Dominica and Trinidad. His journal \\"W.S.W.: A Voyage in that Direction to the West Indies\\" was published the following year.  Art career  Robert Elwes belongs to an inveterate band of 19th-century travellers and explorers. He was to reach many of the places on the South American continent which, just sixteen years earlier, Charles Darwin had visited on his inland journeys from HMS Beagle. Sketching vigorously as he went, he would note with care the different varieties of flora and fauna to be found. It was an interest that was to produce a more renowned family representative in the person of Henry John Elwes of Colesbourne, FRS, who led many expeditions to Turkey, India, Asia Minor, Tibet and Nepal in addition to writing with Augustine Henry the multi-volumed Trees of Great Britain and Ireland. The painter's journeys were conducted at an easy pace, dependent on the frequency of trading ships, coastal cruisers, the availability of pack horses and the hospitality of the local people. His contacts and acquaintanceships were extensive: letters of introduction ensured that he frequently lodged with distinguished company. However, his desire to see for himself the sights of which he had heard and read so much, contributed to some uncomfortable nights and dangerous encounters with bandits and unscrupulous guides. In his books Robert Elwes sought to record his experiences and observations for the future traveller. In the preface of his West Indies volume he explains his intention as informative, \\"for...unless a studies and reads up a country before he goes there he must often be liable to pass by objects worthy of notice without knowing it till afterwards... The lithographs have been done entirely by myself and I hope they will give some idea of the beauty of the scenery.\\" Briefly captured illustrations though these lithographs may be, their accuracy and detail, together with the strength of tonal observation, give them a satisfying quality. From his sketches also came the larger watercolours on rough dark paper, distinguished by his characteristic use of blue and sharp white highlights. At their best these are fine, sensitive evocations of the familiar coastline and countryside round his home, contrasting with the exotic scenes he encountered abroad, from the craggy slopes of the Alps and the Andes, to the shining domes of Moscow and Constantinople. Robert Elwes seldom signed his pictures; however, he used his cipher \\"RE\\" with the R inverted as his signature on sketches and china and \\"R E\\" is how he was affectionately referred to by his family.

Planned as a single performance for 1 July, it was expanded to 10 shows due to the high demand for tickets. It was their first live performance together in 16 years, the second without member Graham Chapman (who died in 1989) and the last with Terry Jones before his death in 2020. The final date was broadcast in cinemas around the world on 20 July. Prior to this Eric Idle stated, ‚ÄúIt is a world event and that‚Äôs really quite exciting. It means we‚Äôre actually going to say goodbye publicly on one show. Nobody ever has the chance to do that. The Beatles didn‚Äôt get a last good night.‚Äù Overview In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the producer of their second film, Holy Grail, over royalties for its musical adaptation Spamalot. They owed a combined ¬£800,000 ($994,600) in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater. To pay these, a reunion show was proposed. It soon became apparent to the group that owing to his theatrical experience with the creation of Spamalot (and because his schedule was free), Eric Idle was best suited to supervise the production. He envisaged an extensive assembly of the best-known Python sketches; to facilitate costume changes, they would be linked by short video clips and elaborate routines of the troupe's songs. The latter would be performed by a full chorus line, choreographed by Arlene Phillips. The music was to be arranged and conducted by Idle's long-time collaborator, John Du Prez. The ten stage shows were held on 1‚Äì5 and 15‚Äì20 July 2014. Tickets for the first night of the show sold out in 43 seconds of being available to purchase. All five surviving Pythons performed on stage together for the first time in 34 years, with archive footage of Graham Chapman interspersed throughout the show. The three-hour show had a 30-minute intermission. The show was billed as \\"The show that leaves you wanting less\\". Some of the sketches were updated to include contemporary references. Carol Cleveland, who appeared in many of the original TV episodes, assisted by playing additional characters, as did newcomer Samuel Holmes, who was given several lead roles, some of which were originally played by Chapman. Eddie Izzard made a small guest appearance as a 'Bruce' on the final night, as well as having appeared the previous evening as the 'Blackmail' special guest. There were also surprise cameos by (amongst others) Stephen Fry, Mike Myers, and Professors Brian Cox and Stephen Hawking. Cox and Hawking were shown in a pre-recorded video towards the end of the Galaxy Song. While Cox was criticising the scientific flaws of the song lyrics, he was run down by Hawking in his wheelchair, who continued to sing the song. Robin Williams was scheduled to be the 'Blackmail' special guest for the final night but declined, as according to Idle he was \\"suffering from severe depression\\" at the time, which ultimately contributed to his suicide in August 2014. When the show was released on video, it was dedicated to Williams. The last of the ten performances was broadcast in the UK on the television channel Gold and internationally in cinemas by Fathom Events through a Dish Network satellite link on Sunday 20 July 2014. The filming of the performance was directed by Aubrey Powell. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, download and streaming on 11 November 2014. A re-edited audio-only recording of the show was exclusively included on two Compact Discs which formed part of the ‚ÄúDeluxe Edition‚Äù of the release - a 60-page 12 inch (60 cm) square hardback picture book with the DVD, Blu-ray and the two CDs housed inside the back cover. The audio only recording of the show omits some material due to its highly visual nature but includes additional dialogue and material not included in the video version. The CDs have a combined running time of 2 hours and five minutes. Critical reception Critical reviews of the show were generally positive. Ed Power from The Telegraph wrote, it was ‚Äúpoignant and predictable, but tremendous fun.‚Äù The negatively tinged review from the Daily Mail was incorporated into the last show with John Cleese and Michael Palin mocking the newspaper and its editor, Paul Dacre onstage. The ten-night show was a financial success, allowing the members of the troupe to pay off their creditor, each pocket ¬£2.2 million and to donate substantially to selected charities.Monty Python team pocket ¬£2.2m each from reunion shows and raise more than ¬£20,000 for charities The Sunday Herald (Scotland), July 17, 2014.

It consists of 15 life-size steel horses which appear to be galloping across a ridge above the Columbia River. Presented as a gift for the centenary of Washington's statehood, the sculpture was conceived as a memorial to the wild horses which once roamed the region. According to the Seattle Times, it is one of the most-seen public artworks in Washington state. Design The original design was for a 36-foot-high tipped basket with two horses still inside and 16 more galloping away from it, a gift from the Grandfather Spirit. In Govedare's imagined tale, the Grandfather Spirit says as he tips the basket: > Creatures of this planet, behold, a Great Basket! I send this basket, > bearing the gift of life, to all corners of the universe. Now, take these > ponies; I am cutting them loose. They will inspire a spirit of free will. > They will be a companion for work and play on this planet. The basket was to be decorated by local artists with designs of people, leaping salmon, and running deer, \\"a sort of futuristic Noah's Ark\\", as Govedare said in 1988.Webster, Dan (1 May 1988). \\"Sculptor Govedare Wants to Free the Ponies\\". Spokesman-Review, p. C10. Retrieved 21 July 2014. However, funds ran out and the basket has yet to be erected. The 15 life-size horses which comprise the sculpture (as of 2014) are made from half-inch-thick panels of COR-TEN steel, a special iron alloy that rusts on the surface but still retains its structural integrity. The horses, now colored a rich red from oxidation and each weighing approximately 1000 pounds, are welded to four- foot-long metal poles set into the ridge on which the sculpture stands.Associated Press (7 October 1990). \\"Sculpture begins ride on river bluff\\". The Bulletin, p. A7. Retrieved 21 July 2014.Ellensburg Daily Record (20 November 1987). \\"Centennial monument gets support\\", p. 3. Retrieved 21 July 2014. History Govedare had previously created several public art sculptures in Washington, most notably The Joy of Running Together, 40 life- size steel runners installed in Spokane's Riverfront Park to honor the annual Bloomsday Run. He conceived the idea for the wild horse project in 1986. The sculpture would celebrate Washington's 100 years of statehood with a monument both to the native peoples of the state and to the wild horses which once roamed there. A ridge above the Columbia River near Vantage Bridge was proposed as the site because the last great roundup of Washington's wild horses took place in the area in 1906. Govedare's proposal was given official support by the Centennial Committee of Grant County in March 1987 followed by support from the centennial committees of the surrounding counties‚ÄîSpokane, Adams, Lincoln, and Kittitas. In November 1987 members of the Washington Centennial Commission also wrote a letter in support of the project. The state's Department of Transport ceded the land on the ridge to Grant County which had pledged to maintain the sculpture and the Thundering Hooves Centennial Sculpture Committee was set up to raise the $250,000 in private funds needed to construct and install the sculpture. The original plan was to install the horses in the spring of 1989 during the state's centennial celebrations. However, fundraising was slow with many potential corporate donors reluctant to support a sculpture that would not be situated in their own community. Only the lead stallion had been completed by August 1989 and was unveiled in Riverfront Park as part of the fundraising drive.Sowa, Tom (14 September 1989). \\"Chasing a dream\\", pp. B1; B3. Spokane Chronicle. Retrieved 22 July 2014. The first six horses were finally installed on the ridge in October 1990 with 9 more in the ensuing months. The sculpture has remained unfinished since then for lack of funds. The 13-ton steel basket from which the horses were to emerge was never constructed. By 2008 the cost of constructing and installing it was estimated at $350,000. Over the years Grandfather Cuts Loose the Ponies has become one of the most-seen public art installations in the state according to the Seattle Times, with 100 million vehicles having driven past it between 1990 and 2008 alone.Lacitis, Erik (4 August 2008). \\"All the pretty horses of Vantage are only half done\\". Seattle Times. Retrieved 21 July 2014. Access Although it can be seen for miles in all directions, the sculpture itself can be accessed via a rough footpath which leads from the east-bound side of the I-90 freeway near Vantage to the top of the ridge. According to the guide book Washington Curiosities, the best viewing point from a distance is Wanapum Vista on I-90 three miles east of Vantage.Baskas, Harriet (2011).

Terminology and categorizations  Deborah Pacini Hern√°ndez noted that due to the majority of Latino immigrants living in New York City mostly being of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent and the area being dominant in the music industry during the 1950s, \\"Latin music\\" had been stereotyped as music simply originating from the Spanish Caribbean. She also observed that even the popularization of bossa nova and Herb Alpert's Mexican- influenced sounds in the 1960s did little to change the perceived image of Latin music. Since then, the music industry classifies all music sung in Spanish or Portuguese as Latin music, including musics from Spain and Portugal. Following protests from Latinos in New York, a category for Latin music was created by National Recording Academy (NARAS) for the Grammy Awards titled Best Latin Recording in 1975. Enrique Fernandez wrote on Billboard that the single category for Latin music meant that all Latin music genres had to compete with each other despite the distinct sounds of the genre. He also noted that the accolade was mostly given to performers of tropical music. Eight years later, the organization debuted three new categories for Latin music: Best Latin Pop Performance, Best Mexican/Mexican-American Performance, and Best Tropical Latin Performance. Latin pop is a catch-all for any pop music sung in Spanish, while Mexican/Mexican-American (also to referred to as Regional Mexican) is based any musical style originating from Mexico or influences by its immigrants in the United States including Tejano, and tropical music focuses any music from the Spanish Caribbean. In 1997, NARAS established the Latin Recording Academy (LARAS) in an effort to expand its operations in both Latin America and Spain. In September 2000, LARAS launched the Latin Grammy Awards, a separate award ceremony from the Grammy Awards, which organizers stated that the Latin music universe was too large to fit on the latter awards. Michael Greene, former head of NARAS, said that the process of creating the Latin Grammy Awards was complicated due to the diverse Latin musical styles, noting that the only thing they had in common was language. As a result, the Latin Grammy Awards are presented to records performed in Spanish or Portuguese, while the organization focuses on music from Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. Since the late 1990s, the United States has had a substantially rising population of \\"Latinos\\", a term popularized since the 1960s due to the wrong and confusing use of the term \\"Spanish\\" and the more proper but less popular term \\"Hispanic\\". The music industry in the United States started to refer to any kind of music featuring Spanish vocals as \\"Latin music\\". Under this definition, Spanish sung in any genre is categorized as \\"Latin\\". In turn, this has also led to artists from Spain being labelled as \\"Latin\\" as they sing in the same language. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Billboard magazine use this definition of Latin music to track sales of Spanish-language records in the United States. Billboard however considers an artist to be \\"Latin\\" if they perform in Spanish or Portuguese. The RIAA initiated the \\"Los Premios de Oro y Platino\\" (\\"The Gold and Platinum Awards\\" in Spanish) in 2000 to certify sales of Latin music albums and singles under a different threshold than its standard certifications. Billboard divides its Latin music charts into three subcategories: Latin pop, Regional Mexican, and tropical. A fourth subcategory was eventually added in the mid 2000s to address the rise of Latin urban music genres such as Latin hip hop and reggaeton.  History  = 1940s‚Äì1950s = The term \\"Latin music\\" originated from the US due to the growing influence of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the American music market, with notable pioneers including Xavier Cugat (1940s) and Tito Puente (1950s) and then accelerating in later decades. As one author explained the rising popularity from the 1940s: \\"Latin America, the one part of the world not engulfed in World War II, became a favorite topic for songs and films for Americans who wanted momentarily to forget about the conflagration.\\" Wartime propaganda for America's \\"Good Neighbor Policy\\" further enhanced the cultural impact. P√©rez Prado is the composer of such famous pieces as \\"Mambo No. 5\\" and \\"Mambo No. 8\\". At the height of the mambo movement in 1955, P√©rez hit the American charts at number one with a cha-cha-ch√° version of \\"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White\\".http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p√©rez-prado-mn0000310383 El manisero, known in English as The Peanut Vendor, is a Cuban son-preg√≥n composed by Mois√©s Simons. Together with \\"Guantanamera\\", it is arguably the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician.Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba.

[list fairly complete up to 1988] sold over a million copies of the sheet music, and was the first million-selling 78 rpm single of Cuban music. = 1960s = The Brazilian bossa nova became widespread in Latin America and later became an international trend, led especially by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. Rock en espa√±ol became popular with the younger generation of Latinos in Latin America, notably including Argentine bands such as Almendra. Mexican-American Latin rock guitarist Carlos Santana began his decades of popularity. = 1970s = Spanish singer Julio Iglesias was recognized by the Guinness World Records in 2013 as the best-selling male Latin artist of all time. Salsa music became the dominant genre of tropical music in the 1970s. Fania Records was credited for popularizing salsa music, with acts such as Rub√©n Blades, H√©ctor Lavoe, and Celia Cruz expanding the audience. In the late 1970s, an influx of balladeers from Spain such as Julio Iglesias, Camilo Sesto, and Raphael established their presence on the music charts both in Latin America and the US Latin market. In 1972, OTI Festival was established by the Organizaci√≥n de Telecomunicaciones de Iberoam√©rica as a songwriting contest to connect the Ibero-American countries (Latin America, Spain, and Portugal) together. Ramiro Burr of Billboard noted that the contest was considered to be the \\"largest and most prestigious songwriting festival in the Latin music world\\". = 1980s = In the 1980s, the Latin ballad continued to be the main form of Latin pop music, with Juan Gabriel, Jos√© Jos√©, Julio Iglesias, Roberto Carlos, and Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez dominating the charts. Salsa music lost some traction, and its musical style changed to a slower rhythm with more emphasis on romantic lyrics. This became known as the salsa romantica era. = 1990s = Bolero music saw a resurgence of popularity with the younger audience. Mexican singer Luis Miguel was credited for the renewed interest due to the success of his album, Romance (1991), a collection of classics covered by the artist. By the mid-1990s, Latin pop music was dominated by younger artists such as Menudo alumnus Ricky Martin, Colombian teen Shakira, and Julio's son Enrique Iglesias. Around the same time, artists from Italy such as Eros Ramazzotti, Laura Pausini, and Nek successfully crossed over to the Latin music field by recording Spanish-language versions of their songs. In the Regional Mexican field, Tejano became the most prominent genre. Selena helped push Tejano music into the mainstream market with her albums Entre a Mi Mundo (1992) and Amor Prohibido (1994), although the genre's popularity declined following her death in 1995. In the tropical music field, merengue, which gained attention in the 1980s, rivaled salsa in popularity. = 2000s = In the mid-2000s, reggaeton became popular in the mainstream market, with Tego Calderon, Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, and Wisin & Yandel considered to be the frontiers of the genre. In the tropical music scene, bachata music became popular in the field, with artists such as Monchy & Alexandra and Aventura finding success in the urban areas of Latin America. Banda was the dominant genre in the Regional Mexican music field. = 2010s = By the turn of the decade, the Latin music field became dominated by up- tempo rhythms, including electropop, reggaeton, urbano, banda and contemporary bachata music, as Latin ballads and crooners fell out of favor among U.S. Latin radio programmers. Streaming has become the dominant form of revenue in the Latin music industry in the United States, Latin America and Spain. Latin trap gained mainstream attention in the mid-2010s with notable artists such as Ozuna, Bad Bunny, and Anuel AA.

Plot synopsis  A successful actor named Michael (Stefano Patrizi) has a dark past where, at a young age, he stabbed his father to death. Along with his girlfriend Deborah (Silvia Dionisio), he visits mother (Anita Strindberg) for the weekend and are joined by the director and other people involved in a film. Soon, the guests begin to get picked off and Michael fears his past will come back to kill him.  Cast  * Stefano Patrizi as Michael Stanford * Martine Brochard as Shirley * Henri Garcin as Hans Schwartz * John Richardson as Oliver * Laura Gemser as Beryl * Anita Strindberg as Glenda Stanford * Silvia Dionisio as Deborah Production In the early 1970s, Fabio Piccioni wrote a short story titled Il grido del Captricorno, which he later apdatpted into an adult comic book in the Oltretomba series. Living across from the office of Salvatore Argento, Piccioni approached Argento and sold him the rights to Il grido del capricorno for 500,000 Italian lire. Some elements of Il grido del capricorno would later appear in Dario Argento's films The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red. Piccioni reused elements of his story again years later in a contemporary setting, with a script made with Antonio Cesare Corti and Riccardo Freda that would become Murder Obsession. Some sources credit the film's original title as L'ossessione che uccide whereas the script located at the BiFi (Biblioth√®que du film) in Paris is titled Deliria and is credited to Corti and Piccioni and dated from 1976. The Deliria script is generally identical to the script used in Murder Obsession with only a few characters named changed. According to Riccardo Freda's daughter Jacqueline Freda, her father took on the script to re-enter the film market and to find room and potential financing for a project based on Francesco Baracca. Murder Obsession was an Italian and French co-production, with the Italian producer Enzo Boetani and his company Dinoysio Cinematografica. Boetani had known Freda for years but never had a chance to complete a production together, working on one unknown project and another titled Superhuman, which Boetani described as a superhero and professional wrestling styled film. Freda brought the script to Boetani and suggested the Italian and French co-production, with the French producer being his friend Simon Mizrahi. Filming went on for three weeks in April 1980, predominantly in palace Borghese in Artena and at Parco della Mola in Oriolo Romano. Actress Laura Gemser recalled her negative experience making the film, who described filming as a \\"nightmare\\" specifically mentioning a scene where Anita Strindberg used a real knife to pretend to stab her. Martine Brochard also did not have fond memories of filming, noting a scene where there is glass specifically cut to fit over her head and a camera with a chainsaw attached to it that got very closer to the actress. Both Brochard and Stefano Patrizi spoke negatively about working with the director, with Brochard noting he treated the French actors badly and Patrizi who had little recollection of the film other than vaguely recalling that Freda was a \\"harsh man, of a few words and not very affable\\" Riccardo Freda did uncredited work on the film as the editor. Release Murder Obsession was submitted to Italian film censors on October 15, 1980 and was passed on October 31 but was only released in Italy on February 24, 1981. Italian film historian Roberto Curti described it as having \\"mediocre business\\" which Boetani blamed on the distributor, who did not pay back the expected sum which lead to the production losing over 50 percent of the production costs. Freda dismissed the film, referring to it as \\"shit\\". The film has been released on home video in the United States as Murder Obsession, Fear and The Wailing. The film was released as Fear on VHS by Wizard Video. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Raro Video. Reception From retrospective reviews, Louis Paul in his book Italian Horror Film Directors declared Murder Obsession to be \\"Freda's best film, although it doesn't make much sense\\" noting that Freda \\"confounds the viewer with hallucinations, red herrings galore and a decidedly downbeat ending\\" and concluding that the film \\"loves to play with the limitations of the genre and seeks to exceed the demands of its audiences at the same time.\\" See also * List of French films of 1981 * List of horror films of 1981 * List of Italian films of 1981  References  =Footnotes= =Sources=  External links * Category:1981 films Category:1981 horror films Category:Films directed by Riccardo Freda Category:Italian films Category:French films Category:Italian horror films Category:French horror films Category:Films shot in Rome ","title":"Murder Obsession"},{"id":"43355275","text":" The Chasle LMC-1 Sprintair is an all-metal, single-seat sports light aircraft designed in France in the early 1970s and intended to be built by aero clubs from plans. Design and development Yves Chasle worked as an A√©rospatiale stress engineer and independently designed several light aircraft, starting with the Chasle YC-12 Tourbillon. Beginning in 1973 he designed the LMC-1 Sprintair, an all-metal, side-by-side two-seater. The first prototype was built by about twenty members of the L√©on-Morane Club, hence the model initials. Most club members were SOCATA employees, based in Tarbes. The Sprintair has a low, cantilever, unswept, constant-chord wing, mounted with 4¬∞ of dihedral and with square tips which have slightly rounded leading edges. Structurally, the wing is a torsion box with a single main spar at 30% chord and a lighter rear auxiliary spar. Almost the whole trailing edge is occupied by a control surface, the outer parts hinged as ailerons and the inner halves as three position flaps. The fuselage is a metal semi-monocoque with a Rolls- Royce Continental O-200-A air-cooled flat four aircraft engine in the nose, driving a two-blade propeller. The two seats are over the wing under a one- piece, forward-hinged canopy which extends ahead of the leading edge. There is a fixed rear transparency that drops down to the fuselage. At the rear, the tall vertical tail is straight-edged with sweep on both fin and rudder; overall sweep is 30¬∞. The tailplane is mounted on top of the extreme rear fuselage and, together with the elevator, is rectangular apart from a projecting, cockpit-adjustable trim tab. Both the tailplane angle of incidence and a rudder trim tab are adjustable on the ground. The Sprintair has fixed tricycle landing gear with main wheels on faired legs mounted on the lower fuselage and an unfaired, telescopic, sprung, steerable nosewheel. Operational history The L√©on-Morane built first prototype was first flown on 18 June 1975 and remained there until written off at Tarbes in 1984. At least two more, possibly three, were completed from plans provided by Chasle; one of them was still active at Toulouse in 2008.

It is a short novel, and could be regarded as a novelette. It first appeared in September 1911 in Popular Magazine.The Abysmal Brute The World of Jack London, accessed July 18, 2014. In the story, a successful boxer, who was brought up in a log cabin and knows little of the real world, begins to realize the corrupt practices in the game of boxing. Background In 1910, when the story was written, London had become a famous writer but he was worried that he had exhausted his ideas. The Abysmal Brute was based on one of several plot outlines he bought from Sinclair Lewis, an admirer of London who was at the beginning of his career. Introduction to the novel, by Michael Oriard accessed July 16, 2014. Other stories by Jack London about boxing are his novel The Game, published in 1905, his short story \\"A Piece of Steak\\" of 1909, and his short story \\"The Mexican\\" of 1911.\\"A Piece of Steak\\" The World of Jack London, accessed July 16, 2014.\\"The Mexican\\" The World of Jack London, accessed July 16, 2014. Summary Sam Stubener, a boxing manager in San Francisco, travels to a remote log cabin in northern California on getting a letter from retired boxer Pat Glendon, who lives there with his son, Pat Glendon Jr, a promising young boxer. Pat Jr fights well; otherwise, he knows little of city life; he hunts and fishes in the forest, he reads poetry and avoids women. Sam brings Pat Jr back to San Francisco. Although Sam and Pat both know he could win a fight with a top boxer, the conventions of boxing require that Pat has to start with a boxer of lower rank. In his first three fights, he knocks out his opponent immediately with one punch. Sam tells Pat to make his fights last longer; since Pat says that he is master of his opponent \\"at any inch or second of the fight\\", they agree on which round the knockout will happen. Pat's career takes off, winning fights worldwide. The newspapers, who interpret his detachment from the real world as unsociability, call him \\"The Abysmal Brute.\\" Sam protects him from the corruption in boxing. Pat is not aware that Sam is using his knowledge of the timing of the knockout in a betting syndicate. Pat is interviewed by Maud Sangster, a journalist from a family of millionaires, at the Cliff House, San Francisco. They immediately fall in love. Maud tells him she has heard in which round he will knock out his opponent in his next fight, and Pat wonders how his agreement with Sam became known. He tells her the knockout will be in a later round; this is to be a secret. When his opponent is knocked out in the round originally agreed with Sam, Maud is angry with Pat. He tells her his opponent faked the knockout; he is beginning to realize the corruption in the game, and says he is quitting boxing, although Sam has arranged a fight against top boxer Tom Cannam. Pat and Maud get married; their honeymoon is spent in the forest and mountains. He decides to return for the fight with Cannam. The event, promoted as an important occasion, starts with speeches from boxing legends to which, unexpectedly, he adds his own, describing the corruption in boxing. This has a sensational effect; he then knocks out Cannam in the first round, and the event ends in uproar.

He was the first lawyer to be cited on California Proposition 215 (1996), the medical marijuana statute, and worked as a professor of law at the San Fernando Valley College of Law from 2006 to 2007. Since 2011 Richards has sat as a temporary judge on the Los Angeles Superior Court. Early and personal life Educated at Beverly Hills High School, he later gained a BA in Political Science at University of California, Los Angeles. While studying at the University of La Verne College of Law, he was elected Student Faculty Representative, and acted as advocate for students facing discipline. He also won the American Jurisprudence Award in bankruptcy. He also is an alumnus of the Anderson School of Management at UCLA and has a certificate of management. He is a lifelong resident of Beverly Hills, California and is very active in the community, including the Beverly Hills Police Officers Association. He was married to Louise Linton. He is currently married to Lauren Boyette-Richards. Career In 2004, Richards was the NBC News Legal Analyst for the Michael Jackson trial. From August 2006 to January 2007, Richards also worked as a professor of law at the San Fernando Valley College of Law. In 2011 he obtained a $630,000 settlement against Tom Cruise's ex-wife for a client, and won a $1,000,000 judgment against a real estate developer at trial in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2012, Richards won over $40 million in commercial guaranty and borrower enforcement judgments. He collected far over that amount through ADR and pretrial resolutions. The firm successfully closed over $100 million in debt transactions. Richards had a decision published in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that dramatically improved the rights of persons who contested forfeiture proceedings. On September 9, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office approved Ronald Richards & Associates' trademark. In December of 2019, Richards was admitted into the D.C. Bar. https://join.dcbar.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=dcbar&WebCode;=FindMemberResults Notable cases In 2000 in U.S v. Orgad, Richards represented Jacob \\"Cookie\\" Orgad (No. 00-344 FMC) and had the charges dismissed in Los Angeles due to government violating the Speedy Trial Act. The case was dismissed with prejudice. Subsequent to this rare procedural victory, Orgad was indicated in New York on related charges. Richards was disqualified as trial counsel only due to the fact that Richards may have been a witness in the case. Ultimately, Mr. Orgad pleaded guilty without the aid of Richards in his New York case after he had lost the attorney who had won his case in Los Angeles. This was a play out of the John Gotti playback where the government disqualified Bruce Cutler causing Gotti to lose his trusted advocate. Ironically, the trial court judge now a defense attorney was the prosecutor who used the same tactic against Bruce Cutler. In 2003, in U.S. v. Tamer Adel IBRAHIM (9th Cir. 2008) 522 F.3d 1003 (No. 07-50153), Richards represented alleged drugs courier and dealer Tamer Adel Ibrahim. During the search of Ibrahim's apartment in 1999, state and federal law enforcement officers seized nearly $500,000 in cash; Ibrahim was eventually convicted and sentenced to 188 months in prison, and ordered to pay $9 million in fines and restitution. Shortly after the seizure, the United States moved to forfeit the money seized from Ibrahim's apartment, but sent the notice to Ibrahim's cousin John instead. In 2006, Tamer Ibrahim filed for return of property, as he had never received proper notice of forfeiture from the government. The motion for return of property was denied in district court, and Richards, representing Tamer Ibrahim, successfully argued to overturn the seizure ruling before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. After the forfeiture order was reversed, the government settled the case with Ibrahim and released him five years early. In February 2011, in People v. Troyer (2011) 51 Cal.4th 599, Richards filed an amicus curiae brief to the case, stating that \\"judges evaluating police searches must look at whether police had an objectively reasonable basis to believe there was an emergency\\", citing the conflict between People v. Ray (1999) and Brigham City v. Stuart. The Supreme Court of California ruled that the entry of local police in Sacramento County into the bedroom of Albert Troyer without a warrant was legal, covered by the emergency-aid exception to the Fourth Amendment's legal protections against unreasonable search and seizure. In 2011, Richards represented former venture capitalist Russell Armstrong in numerous matters. He was married to Taylor Armstrong, a cast member of the Bravo TV series The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. After allegations of money troubles and claims of domestic violence surfaced within the show, Russell committed suicide, found by his landlord and Taylor on August 15, 2011. In June 2014, Richards successfully represented Navabeh Borman in the California Court of Appeal in suing her ex-attorney Hillel Chodos in Chodos v. Borman (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 76. Borman was being sued by Chodos for unpaid attorney fees relating to Borman's divorce and subsequent Marvin action, which had resulted in a tax-free $26 million settlement to Borman. Justice Richard Mosk said that Judge Barbara Ann Meiers in her original ruling should not have allowed the jury to consider a multiplier, and hence reduced Chodos's payment from $7.8 million to $1.8 million, which the court said represented a reasonable hourly rate of $1,000 for the 1,800 hours the jury found Chodos had worked on the case.

Barber II (born August 30, 1963) is an American Protestant minister and political activist. He is the President and Senior Lecturer at Repairers of the Breach and co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. He also serves as a member of the national board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the chair of its Legislative Political Action Committee. From 2006-2017, Barber served as president of the NAACP's North Carolina state chapter, the largest in the Southern United States and the second-largest in the country. He has pastored Greenleaf Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Goldsboro, North Carolina since 1993.  Education and family  Barber was born in Indianapolis to Eleanor Barber and William J. Barber, Sr, who then moved their young family to Washington County, North Carolina to participate in the desegregation of the public school system there: his mother as a secretary/office manager, his father as a physics teacher, and young Barber as a kindergarten student. Barber was elected president of the local NAACP youth council in 1978, at the age of 15. At 17, he became student body president of his high school, the first president to serve the integrated school for an entire year, breaking the previous tradition of alternating a black president & white president for each semester. He then enrolled at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and became student government president at age 19. He received his bachelor's degree in political science from NCCU, cum laude; a Master of Divinity degree from Duke University; and a doctorate from Drew University with a concentration in public policy and pastoral care. In 1984, he met a first-year NCCU student, Rebecca McLean, at a march in support of Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign; they married three years later. In his early 20s, Barber was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, which has affected his spine ever since.  Activism  Beginning in April 2013, Barber led regular \\"Moral Mondays\\" civil-rights protests in North Carolina's state capital, Raleigh. The Wall Street Journal credited Barber's NAACP chapter with forming a coalition in 2007 named Historic Thousands on Jones Street People's Assembly, composed of 93 North Carolina advocacy groups. \\"With this changing demographic, we had to operate in coalition,\\" Barber was quoted as saying. Historian and professor Timothy Tyson named Barber, \\"the most important progressive political leader in this state in generations,\\" saying that he \\"built a statewide interracial fusion political coalition that has not been seriously attempted since 1900.\\" An article in the Michigan State Law Review, \\"Confronting Race: How a Confluence of Social Movements Convinced North Carolina to Go where the McCleskey Court Wouldn't\\" credits him with bringing together a statewide political coalition. He, \\"has become as well known [in North Carolina] as [Governor] Pat McCrory and Republican leaders of the House and Senate,\\" according to a 2013 Huffington Post profile of him. He traveled with NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous to meet with Georgia prison officials. In 2014, he founded Repairers of the Breach, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization \\"formed to educate and train religious and other leaders of faith who will pursue policies and organizational strategies for the good of the whole and to educate the public about connections between shared religious faith.\\" In 2016, he delivered a speech at the Democratic National Convention; the address was described as rousing and was well-received. On May 30, 2017, Barber was arrested after refusing to leave the North Carolina State Legislative Building during a protest over health care legislation. The following month, a state magistrate banned Barber and the other protesters from entering the Legislative Building. Barber and his lawyers contend that the ban is unconstitutional, because the state constitution guarantees citizens the right to assemble to communicate with their legislators. In May 2017 Barber announced he would step down from the state NAACP presidency to lead \\"a new 'Poor People's Campaign'\\", named Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for a Moral Revival in honour of the original 1968 campaign founded by Martin Luther King Jr..  Recognitions  Barber meeting with Senator Kamala Harris in 2018. Barber was awarded the 2006 Juanita Jackson Mitchell, Esq. Award for legal activism, the highest award in the NAACP for legal redress for advocacy, he was the 2008 recipient of the Thalheimer Award for most programmatic NAACP State Conference, and in 2010 he won the National NAACP Kelly M. Alexander Humanitarian Award. North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue awarded him the Order of the Long Leaf Pine in 2009‚Äîa North Carolina citizenship award presented to outstanding North Carolinians who have a proven record of service to the state. In 2017, Barber was awarded an honorary doctorate from Drew University, his alma mater, and also delivered the university's sesquicentennial address at commencement exercises. Barber was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Occidental College preceding his speech (which was also livestreamed) to students, alumni, and community members in Thorne Hall. In 2018, Barber was named a MacArthur Fellow (popularly known as the \\"Genius Grant\\") for \\"building broad-based fusion coalitions as part of a moral movement to confront racial and economic inequality.\\" Publications *Preaching Through Unexpected Pain (self- published) *Forward Together: A Moral Message for the Nation (Chalice Press, 2014, ). *The Third Reconstruction: Moral Mondays, Fusion Politics, and the Rise of a New Justice Movement (Beacon Press, 2016, ) *Revive Us Again: Vision and Action in Moral Organizing (Beacon Press, 2018, ) * We Are Called To Be A Movement (Workman Publishing Co., Inc., 2020), References  Further reading  \\"The Rev.

Characteristics As of 2012, it is one of seven galaxy clusters that exhibit separation of dark matter and baryonic matter following cluster collision and merger. The separation between the galaxies and their dark matter components is on average . This separation may indicate that dark matter may interact with itself, through a dark force (a force that only interacts with dark matter) or a set of dark forces.

Package forwarding is becoming more and more popular among international shoppers because of the high growth rate of e-commerce websites and shipping limitations of most such websites. Package forwarding service is provided by package forwarders to make cross-border shopping convenient and easy, getting rid of the problems in payment and shipping. A package forwarding service is different from mail forwarding. Mail forwarding refers to the mail in traditional meaning, or magazines or papers that are normally called mail, while package forwarding refers to online purchases or orders that are shipped within a bag or a box. Reasons There are several reasons that caused package forwarding service into existence: # Fast development of online e-commerce shopping. # The convenient of international checkout with PayPal and others. # The needs of shoppers in one country that desire to buy from online retailers from another country. # Transit safety and insurance features provided by some providers. # The price differences between domestic stores and international stores. There are several challenges with cross- border (US retailer) online shopping, and these include shipping and paying for orders. For instance, US online stores are popular worldwide, but some of them only ship to US addresses or their international shipping rates are prohibitive. US package forwarding services help international shoppers with shipping their purchases from the US to their home address or help them place a direct order with the US retailers if they do not have a US billing address. Since 2010, this (US) model has been emulated internationally and currently there are many countries offering a very similar service to overseas buyers. Procedure A package forwarding service works normally with five steps: # The shopper first gets a native shipping address (which is the same as the package forwarders warehouse) and a member number (account number) from a package forwarder. # The shopper places an online order and for the shipping address, uses the native shipping address and the member number (usually presented like a suite number). # Package forwarders receive the package and register to the shopper and usually provide some sort of storage. # Shoppers pay the package forwarder for various package handling services and an international shipping fee. # The package forwarder ships the package out and the shopper receives the package at home.

He was born at Erpingham, Norfolk and died at Sheringham, also in Norfolk. Cricket career Kemp appeared in four first-class matches. He played once for MCC in 1872 and then in three games while he was at Cambridge University in 1873, though in only one of the three did he appear for the university side ‚Äì he played against the university for an MCC team and a side that was called \\"An England XI\\". He was a middle- or lower-middle-order batsman and for the \\"England\\" team he bowled three overs without taking a wicket; his highest score was also in that game with an innings of 41. Though Kemp's senior cricket ended in 1873, he continued to play in non-first-class MCC matches for the next decade and more, and also appeared in non-first-class games for the Norfolk county side which was founded in 1876. Career outside cricket Kemp was the son of Nunn Robert Pretyman Kemp, a Norfolk clergyman; he owed his middle name to his mother, who had been a Miss Hagar. His father died when he was six years old, and Kemp was then educated at the Clergy Orphan School in Canterbury, followed by Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1874, following the deaths of two elderly and childless cousins (and the death the previous year of his own elder brother), he inherited the Kemp baronetcy which dated from 1642 and which brought him ownership of Gissing Hall in Norfolk and substantial landholdings. Following graduation from Cambridge University in 1875, Kemp had a varied career. He joined the British Army as a second lieutenant, but also trained as a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1880. He was also a partner in the Norfolk bank, Lacon Youell & Kemp, and in the 1895 general election and the 1899 by-election he stood for the Conservatives in the North Norfolk constituency, unsuccessfully. Kemp's military and legal careers lasted for many years. He served with the Norfolk Regiment in South Africa from 1899 to 1902 and was colonel of the Third Battalion, a Territorial Army unit from 1904 to 1910. During the First World War, he was a colonel in the 2nd (Garrison) Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment before returning to the Norfolk Regiment at a colonel; at the end of the war he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire \\"for valuable services rendered in connection with the War\\". As a lawyer, he was the author of a book on the Law of Allotments and practised as a barrister on the South-East Circuit. Family Kemp married Henrietta Hamilton in 1876; they had one son, Richard Hamilton Kemp, and four daughters. Richard Kemp predeceased his father and left two daughters of his own, so the baronetcy became extinct on Kenneth Kemp's death in 1936.

In each chapter, a different story is detailed, with a focus on specific people Singer encountered in his neighborhood during this period.

Obelisk Support uses a flexible 'outsourcing' working model where lawyers work remotely for the client, either on stand-by or as supporting legal advisers. Lawyers are placed with City law firms or in-house on an interim basis, and work as an extension within a business. Obelisk Support uses former city solicitors, many of them women who may enjoy a more flexible schedule (e.g. to raise a family). Obelisk Support also provides a language facility which uses qualified lawyers to translate legal documents into 27 world languages. History and Development Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, (former president of The Law Society and the current House of Lords Commissioner for Standards), noted the exodus of women solicitors leaving the profession to have children and argued that the situation will only change if the legal sector invests in targeted career development support for women. Obelisk Support was founded by Dana Denis-Smith in 2010 to aid both women and men, who take time out of law to have a family. The company was founded on the idea of flexible work in law. The name of the company was inspired by Cleopatra's Needle in London.History of the name on the company website Paul Owers, a partner at private-equity firm Actis and an Obelisk client, documents Obelisk Support‚Äôs ethical mission of providing flexible working solutions to professional women and men who take time off work for personal and family reasons. He notes, however, that there is a challenge in promoting the model from a business perspective, given the legal sector‚Äôs traditionally conservative approach to innovation in the market. In 2014, Obelisk Support recorded a revenue growth of 400%. In March 2017, Obelisk Support signed a deal with Linklaters to use its pool of flexible lawyers to provide an additional staffing resource. Obelisk Support provides legal support to 35 FTSE 100 companies, including Barclays, BT, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, ING, Intel and Vodafone.

The fort is positioned 18 miles north-east of Eboracum on the River Derwent. Site name The Roman name for the Malton military complex first appears in the Antonine Itinerary of the late-second century.Wenham, L.P. and Haywood, B. 1997. The 1968-1970 excavations in the vicus at Malton, North Yorkshire (Yorkshire Archaeological Report no.3). Leeds: Yorkshire Archaeological Society, Roman Antiquities Section It is also mentioned in the 4th/5th century Notitia Dignitatum as Deruentione - the last auxiliary garrison \\"at the disposal of the Right Honourable Duke of the Britains\\". Archaeological investigations Initial investigations at the site were undertaken by Philip Corder and John Kirk in the 1930s.Jones, R. 2009. Roman Malton. Malton: Malton Museum The excavated material from this site formed the core collection of the Malton Museum. These excavations took in both the defences and interior buildings of the north-east corner of the fort and trial trenches in the south-west of the fort. A further series of excavations between 1949 and 1952 by the Ministry of WorksMitchelson, N. 1964. 'Roman Malton: the civilian settlement. Excavations in Orchard Field, 1949-1952.' Yorkshire Archaeological Journal Vol. 41. pp209-61 in the civilian settlement uncovered multiple phases of activity as well as a road, several buildings and a mosaic. Timber and stone structures were identified during excavations on the fort in 1970 by Leslie Peter Wenham. A complex building sequence was revealed, with major phases occurring during the Trajanic, Severan, Constantian and Theodosian periods. The south and west defences of an early Roman military work were confirmed beneath the vicus buildings, very likely a southern annexe of the known fort. These additional defences comprised a turf rampart 16 ft (4.9m) wide, backing a ditch 6 ft (1.8m) wide and 3¬Ωft (1.2m) deep. Plaque recording the excavations by Philip Corder The fort The earliest secure construction of a fort at Malton was in the AD 70s under Agricola, contemporary with the nearby fortress at Eboracum. Built on the north side of the River Derwent, this original phase was in timber, with the wall being rebuilt in stone in the early second century. The presence of the Ala shows that for at least part of its history, Derventio was capable of housing a mounted cavalry unit. Only a single unit has been clearly associated with occupation at this site, the Ala Gallorum Picentiana (The Picentine wing of Gauls). The single record of this unit is an altar dedicated by the Prefect Candidus, from the ruins of the Severan bathhouse. It remains unclear when the Ala Gallorum Picentiana were first established at Malton and when they left. Civilian settlement As with many Roman forts, a civilian settlement grew up around the established military base. The evidence at Malton shows extramural settlement surrounding the south gate of the fort and crossing to the south side of the river, following the roads leading away from the fort. Many buildings were discovered, the most elaborate of which was found some 150 ft south of the fort, measured 90 ft by 30 ft and included heated floors. One mid-second century structure contained circular baking ovens. To the west of the road a series of rectangular buildings of an average size of 25 by 40 ft stood closely compacted together and have been interpreted as workshops or store-houses; most of the pottery from this area, including much local ware, and coin evidence dates this area to the second half of the third and the first half of the fourth century. It has been suggested that a spring in the north-east of the civilian settlement may have been the source for the bath- house, although the structure has not been located. A canal, dug in 1810, destroyed any of the structures which may have been close to the line of the river. Trade and economy The fort lies on the north banks of the River Derwent, the civilian settlement on the south site. The Roman road network provides access to the east coast and to larger settlements like Eboracum. Evidence exists for the working of bronze, iron and pewter. The locally sourced jet was worked at the site into jewellery. A single inscription, from beneath the New Malton Church, offered a dedication to the genius of the place and to wish good luck to a young slave inheriting a goldsmith's shop,Collingwood, R.G. and Wright, R.P. 1965.

Oxford: Claredon Press. no.711 Post-Roman Malton Castle, a motte-and-bailey castle was built by the de Vesci family over the west corner of the Roman fort in the 11th Century. This was demolished in the 17th century when a mansion was built on the site by Lord Eure, which was destroyed in 1674. The Dark Age settlement is the setting for much of the action in An East Wind Blowing by Australian author Mel Keegan. Visible remains The original earthworks are still visible in the centre of the modern town in an area known as 'Orchard Fields'.

Recent work to raise the profile of Tea-tree Fingers (Hypocreopsis amplectens) including an educational booklet produced by Fungimap in 2016https://fungimap.org.au/tea-tree-fingers-project-photo-monitoring/ resulted in a fourth site being found in the Victorian Yarra Valley by the Fungi Group of the Victorian Field Naturalists Club in 2017. This new population has had the largest number of individual fruiting bodies recorded on new host plant the Yarra Burgan (Kunzea leptospermoides). Since 2016 repeated visits the Adams Creek and Grantville Nature Conservation Reserves have confirmed small populations survive, however recent surveys of the original location in Greens Bush, on the Mornington Peninsula have resulted in no sightings. Observations based on photographs indicate that this species was observed in 2006 at Hamner Forest Park, Canterbury of the South Island New Zealand and in 2015 the New England National Park, New South Wales Australia. Despite identification information about this species being available since 2005, Tea-tree Fingers (Hypocreopsis amplectens) is confirmed from only three sites of 5 sites in the since 2016 in Australia, making it a rare fungus eligible for inclusion on national threat status lists in AustraliaMay TW, McMullan-Fisher SJM 2016 Holding on to Tea-tree fingers: a critically endangered fungus.

Barcelona. Catalan Encyclopedia Group was a post- impressionist painter. Artistic biography His first teacher in Sabadell was Joan Vila Cinca. He would later study at the Royal Academy of Beaux Art of San Fernando in Madrid, and at the School of Beaux Arts of Sant Jordi (Llotja) in Barcelona with the masters Josep Calb√≥ and Antoni Caba. He completed his studies in Brussels. During his early years, he combined the family business with painting. In 1921 he exhibited his work for the first time in the Serra Salon of Barcelona, and in 1926 he had his first personal exhibition in the Par√©s Salon in Barcelona. In 1931 he abandoned all his mercantile activity to dedicate himself exclusively to painting, until his death in 1955. Family The Planas family had extensive properties in Les Corts, Barcelona (now the manor and terrains of the Bar√ßa Football Club), in Sant Mart√≠ de Proven√ßals and Badalona. Planas Doria married Assumpci√≥ Viloca Puig, the daughter of a textile industrialist from Sabadell. His descendants are two daughters and five grandchildren. Of all of them, only his granddaughter, Gl√≤ria Rognoni, dedicates herself to the arts, as actress, playwright and stage director. Positions and distinctions In 1921 he won two prizes at the competition ‚ÄúBarcelona seen by its artists.‚Äù In 1936 he was granted the Prize of Honor at the Autumn Salon in Madrid. In 1936 he was elected president of the Royal Artistic circle of Barcelona, and in 1942, vice-president of the Water-color Artists Association of Catalonia. After the civil war (1936‚Äì1939) he participated as a painter in the board of restoration of the church of El Pi in Barcelona. In 1946, the City Hall of Sabadell gave him the Silver Medal of the city. Work Planas Doria described himself as an urban landscaper. Dedicating his entire work to figurative art, in 1926 he wrote: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe myself authorized to judge the new art, but I must tell you in truth, clearly and definitely, that I do not like it, and if someday you see me painting it, think that I am no longer myself.‚Äù In 2005 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of his death, the critic Arnau Puig named his conference at the Royal Artistic Circle, ‚ÄúFrom Claudio Lorena and the theatrical landscape to the natural landscape of Planas Doria‚Äù.Lecture of Arnau Puig on Dec 1, 2005 at the Royal Artistic Circle of Barcelona The teachers of Planas Doria at the Llotja were set designers. His paintings breathe this influence in their perspective and light. The journalist Pl√†cid Garc√≠a-Planas in a lecture in 2006 refers to Planas Doria in the journal La Vangu√†rdia as ‚Äúthe painter of factories.‚Äù \\"El pintor de f√°bricas\\". Published in La Vanguardia Sept 10, 2006 According to him few Catalan artists ‚Äì not to say none ‚Äì have painted with such veracity fumes and steams and furnaces.

These are generally used to produce plastic parts using a core and a cavity. Molds are designed as two-plate or three-plate molds, depending on the type of component to be manufactured. The two plate mold requires a single day in light, while the three plate mold requires two days. Mold construction depends on the shape of the component, which determines the parting line selection, runner and gate selection and component ejection system selection. The mold base size depends on component size and number of cavities to be planned per mold. Design considerations * Draft: Required in both the core and cavity for easy ejection of the finished component * Shrinkage allowance: Depends on shrinkage property of material core and cavity size * Cooling circuit: In order to reduce the cycle time, water circulates through holes drilled in both the core and cavity plates. * Ejection gap: The gap between the ejector plate face and core back plate face should hold dimension within the core. It must allow component to be fully removed from the mold. * Air vents: Removes gases entrapped between core and cavity (usually less than 0.02 mm gap), because excessive gaps can result in flash defects. * Mold polishing: The core, cavity, runner and sprue should have good surface finish and should be polished along material flow direction. * Mold filling : The gate should be placed such that the component is filled from the thicker section to thinner section. Injection mold in molding machine cavity plate cooling by drilled holes Direct cooling of core insert Annular cooling of cavity insert Elements * Register ring‚ÄîAligns injection molding machine screws with the injection mold. Usually made of case-hardened, medium carbon steel material (CHMCS). * Sprue bushing ‚Äî The bush has a taper hole of 3¬∞ to 5¬∞ and is usually made of CHMCS. The material enters the mold through the sprue bush. * Top plate‚ÄîIt is used to clamp the top half of the mold to the moving half of the molding machine and is usually made of mild steel. * Cavity plate‚ÄîThe plate used to create a cavity (via a gap) that will be filled with the plastic material and form the plastic component. Usually made of mild steel. * Core plate‚ÄîThe core plate projects into the cavity place and creates hollow portions in the plastic component. This core plate is usually made of hardened hot die P20 steel without hardening after core machining. * Sprue puller bushing ‚Äî The sprue puller bush is used to accommodate the sprue puller pin; usually made of CHMCS. * Sprue puller pin‚ÄîThe sprue puller pin pulls the sprue from the sprue bush. It is usually made of CHMCS * Core back plate‚ÄîIt holds the core insert in place and acts as a \\"stiffener\\". It is usually made of mild steel. * Guide pillar and guide bushing ‚Äî The guide pillar and guide bush align the fixed and moving halves of a mold in each cycle. The material cases are usually made of medium carbon steel and will have higher hardness. * Ejector guide pillar and guide bush‚ÄîThese components ensure the alignment of the ejector assembly so that the ejector pins are not damaged. They are usually made of CHMCS. The guide pillar typically has higher hardness than the guide bush. * Ejector plate‚ÄîThis holds the ejector pins and is usually made of mild steel. * Ejector back plate‚ÄîIt prevents the ejector pins from disengaging; usually of mild steel material. * Heel blocks‚ÄîProvides a gap for the ejector assembly, so that the finished component ejects from the core. Usually made of mild steel. * Bottom plate‚ÄîClamps the bottom half of the mold with the fixed half of the molding machine; usually made of mild steel. * Centering bush‚ÄîProvides alignment between the bottom plate and the core back plate; usually made of CHMCS. * Rest button‚ÄîSupports the ejection assembly and reduces the area of contact between the ejection assembly and the bottom plate. It is most helpful when cleaning the injection molding machine, which is essential to ensure an \\"unmarked\\" finished component. Small foreign particles sticking to the bottom plate may cause ejection pins to project out from the core and result in ejection pin marks on the component. The core and cavity will be usually be made of either P20, En 30B, S7, H13, or 420SS grade steel. The core is the male part which forms the internal shape of molding. The cavity is the female part which forms external shape of molding. = Gate types = The two main gate systems are manually trimmed gates and automatically trimmed gates. The following examples show where they are used: * Spru gate: Used for large components, the gate mark is visible in component and no runner is required. e.g.: bucket molding (backside cylindrical gate mark visible and can be felt). * Edge gate: Most suitable for square, rectangular components * Ring gate: Most suitable for cylindrical components to eliminate weld line defect * Diaphragm gate: Most suitable for hollow, cylindrical components * Tab gate: Most suitable for solid, thick components * Submarine gate: Used when auto de-gating is required to reduce cycle time * Reverse taper sprue gate (Pin gate): Generally used in three plate molds. * Winkle Gate: Its mainly used for electronics product gate flow the material under the core side = Ejection system types = * Pin ejection‚ÄîCylindrical pins eject the finished component. In the case of square and rectangular components, a minimum of four pins (at the four corners) are required. In the case of cylindrical components, three equidistant pins (i.e. 120¬∞ apart) are required. The number of pins required may vary based on the component profile, size and area of ejection. This ejection system leaves visible ejection marks on the finished component. * Sleeve ejection‚ÄîThis type of ejection is preferred for (and limited to) cylindrical cores, where the core is fixed in the bottom plate. In this system, the ejection assembly consists of a sleeve that slides over the core and ejects the component. No visible ejection marks are apparent on the component. * Stripper plate ejection‚ÄîThis ejection is preferred for components with larger areas. This system calls for an additional plate (stripper) between the core and cavity plates. To avoid flash, the stripper plate remains in contact with the cavity plate and a gap is maintained between the cavity and core plate. Visible ejection marks are usually not noted on components. * Blade ejection‚ÄîThis type of ejection is preferred for thin, rectangular cross sections. Rectangular blades are inserted in cylindrical pins (or cylindrical pins are machined to rectangular cross sections) to create an appropriate ejection length for the component. For easy accommodation of the ejection pin head, a counter bore is provided in the ejection plates. * By rotation of core (internal threaded components)‚ÄîUsed for threaded components, where the component is automatically ejected by rotating the core insert. * Air ejection‚ÄîUsed to actuate the ejection pin fitted in the core using compressed air. The ejection pin is retracted using a spring. = Alignment = Injection molds are designed as two halves, a core half and a cavity half in order to eject the component. For each cycle, the core and cavity are aligned to ensure quality. This alignment is ensured by guide pillar and guide bush. Usually, four guide pillars and guide bushes are used, out of which three pillars are of one diameter and one is of a different diameter, to force the plates into a single configuration (based on the \\"POKE YOKE\\" [mistake proof] concept). The register ring has interference fit in top plate and transmission fit with the injection molding machine pattern, aligning the machine pattern and top plate. = Mold cooling = Desirable attributes of the mold cooling design include: * Constant mold temperature for uniform quality * Reduced cycle time for productivity * Improved surface finish without defects * Avoiding warpage by uniform mold surface temperature (warpage caused by nonuniform cooling) * Long mold life  Methods  * Cavity plate cooling by drilled holes‚ÄîThe cavity plate is drilled around the cavity insert and plugged with copper or aluminum taper plugs at the ends of openings. Using pipe connected at the inlet and outlet ports, water is circulated to cool the mold. * Direct cooling of core insert (baffle system)‚ÄîThe core is drilled by keeping sufficient wall thickness. A baffle plate is located between the drilled hole, dividing the hole into two halves, allowing the water to contact the maximum area in core so cooling may take place. * Annular cooling of cavity insert‚ÄîA circular groove is made on the core for water circulation. To prevent leakage, O-rings are used above and below the cooling channel. * Core is moving side & cavity is fixed side in a .eg Cooling can affect product quality See also * Injection molding * Injection molding machine References * Injection Mould Design R.G.W.

After spending a couple of summers working as a laborer and clay modeler for Ford Motor Company, McRae was hired as a designer at Kaiser-Frazier Corporation in September, 1949 where he was involved with the development of the 1951 Kaiser. He went on to work at Studebaker Packard Corporation beginning in August, 1955, where he became chief stylist. Along with other designers at Studebaker, McRae helped design several models, including the 1958 Packard Hawk and the 1959 Studebaker Lark, a small car which sold in sufficient numbers to keep Studebaker afloat for several more years. McRae left Studebaker in 1960 and worked for a year at Curtiss-Wright Corporation. He then operated his own design studio in Muskegon, Michigan, working on various freelance design projects. In 1964 McRae was hired by Ford Motor Company as a designer. He was transferred later that year to Ford of England, where we worked on the design of the Mark II Cortina, the Escort and the original Capri. In 1967 McRae was transferred to Ford of Germany where he led the design team which developed the Taunus 23M. After spending a year back at Ford's design center in Dearborn, Michigan, McRae was transferred to Ford of Australia in September 1969 where he became chief of design.

It is now in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia.Museum page This is the first of three large paintings of the subject done by Tiepolo. In addition the much smaller oil studies or modelli for each survive.Christiansen, 152‚Äì153 Tiepolo's fresco version for the ballroom of the Palazzo Labia, Venice (slightly trimmed) Tiepolo returned to the subject a few years later at the Palazzo Labia in Venice with his frescos on Antony and Cleopatra: the Banquet was paired with a Meeting of Cleopatra and Mark Anthony and surrounding scenes of gods and attendants. Two further large oils by Tiepolo of these scenes are in Arkhangelskoye Palace near Moscow (1747, 338 x 600 cm).Anderson, 209 Tiepolo typically made oil sketch modelli with varying degrees of finish to show his composition and, perhaps, submit it for approval to the client. The modello for the Melbourne painting is in the Mus√©e Cognacq-Jay in Paris, and was owned by Count Francesco Algarotti until his death.Christiansen, 152Anderson, 201 There is a small () oil sketch by Tiepolo in the National Gallery, London, which may relate to the Palazzo Labia, although it differs considerably from the work in Venice, and it is more usually regarded as a study for the Archangelskoye painting. There is another small oil in the collection of Stockholm University in Sweden, a modello for the Palazzo Labia composition, and there are a number of preparatory drawings in various collections.Anderson, 201, 209; Christiansen, 150‚Äì152 Composition All three large compositions show the banquet taking place in the open air or a loggia with a grand architectural setting but with the sky visible, and include a raised terrace closing off the back of the pictorial space. In the Palazzo Labia and Arkhangelskoye paintings (and the Paris and London modelli) there are steps in the foreground leading up to the dining table; although the Melbourne painting lacks these steps, the pattern of the marble floor gives a similar visual effect. Only the two or three main figures are seated, but various attendants stand around them. All the compositions show a clear debt to the grandly theatrical feast paintings of Paolo Veronese, nearly a century earlier, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563, Louvre) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573, Accademia, Venice). Venetian taste approved of such explicit reference to the city's artistic tradition. In the Palazzo Labia the frescos were designed in conjunction with a scheme of trompe l'oeil architecture by Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna embracing the whole space. The frescos come almost down to the floor, so that the steps bring the main scene up to a height where they could be seen across a crowded room.Martineau & Robinson, 194 The subject of the Banquet paintings is an supposed episode described by both Pliny's's Natural History (9.58.119-121) and Plutarch's Lives (Antony 25.36.1), in which Cleopatra takes an expensive pearl and dissolves it in her wine, prior to imbibing the drink.Tiepolo, Theater, and the Notion of Theatricality, Keith Christiansen. The Art Bulletin Vol. 81, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), pp. 665-692. The episode depicts the spartan Roman warrior represented by Antony being seduced by the sensual opulence of the East, as exemplified by Cleopatra. The wealth of the scene is compounded by the presence of black servants, often held as slaves in Venice. With respect to the Labia frescoes, it is not clear if this family, newly inducted into the patriciate, would have been attempting through this fresco, not only to display their ability to employ one of the best local artists, but also to remind visitors of the Labia's wealth, and specifically the palazzo's owner, Maria Labia's jewelry collection. It is also not clear if the fresco, is a distant allegory of the movement eastward of the Labia family, originally from Spain,Web Gallery of Arts, short note. to this mainly Levantine republic. Provenance The Melbourne painting was commissioned for Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, by his agent Francesco Algarotti.Anderson, parts II and III According to a letter of 1744 from Algarotti to Heinrich von Br√ºhl (1700‚Äì1763), the Saxon chief minister, he saw it unfinished in Tiepolo's studio, where it had been commissioned by someone else, and persuaded Tiepolo to finish it for Dresden.Christiansen, 150 It has been speculated that the original commissioner was the English \\"Consul Smith\\". It was acquired in 1764 by Catherine the Great in Amsterdam. The work remained in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in what was then Saint Petersburg and later became Leningrad. It was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, and was purchased by an English art dealer in 1932. It was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1933 for A¬£25,000; according to some accounts the National Gallery in London wanted the painting, but stood aside to allow Melbourne to improve their collection.

Wurm draws on a combination of modern German, Austrian, and American aesthetics to depict human interactions and daily life.  Biography  Born in New York, Wurm moved at age three to California, then to Innsbruck, Austria at age eight before returning to Los Angeles four years later. It was during this early sojourn in Europe that Wurm first began drawing.Bonny Zanardi, ‚ÄúCity Arts Presents an Exhibit of Works of Jan Wurm,‚Äù Oakland Tribune, Feb. 22, 2007 At the University of California Los Angeles Wurm achieved a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts, studying with Richard Diebenkorn and Llyn Foulkes. She gained her graduate degree at the Royal College of Art in London where her tutors were Peter Blake and Philip Rawson. in 1978, her work was shown at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall Park in the vibrant program headed by director Josine Ianco- Starrels. Infused with the light of the Southland, Jan Wurm's canvases dipped into a luminous palette. Yet, as later noted by critic, Josef Woodard, \\"Angst hums in the periphery of seemingly casual scenes.\\" Wurm eventually settled in Berkeley, which became the base from which she established an active role in the community, teaching and lecturing for the ASUC Berkeley Art Studio and UC Berkeley Extension. Working with the UC Art Alumni Group Steering Committee Wurm organizes an annual symposium and facilitates a monthly Art Meet Up. She established ‚ÄúSpring Training‚Äù, a new program connecting artists with dealers, critics, and curators in one-on-one mentoring sessions. In 2009 she established and facilitated the ongoing Artist Lecture Series for the Berkeley Art Center. She teaches summer courses in Europe, including the Kuenstlerdorf in Neumarkt an der Raab, Austria in Summer 2014. In 2014, she curated \\"Closely Considered - Diebenkorn in Berkeley\\" at the Richmond Art Center in Richmond, CA.  Work  The monumental, life size paintings of Jan Wurm depict the cycle of life from childhood through old age, reflecting on relationships, unspoken emotions, and specific moments in time. As art historian, Suzaan Boettger, has written, \\"This 'social realism' exemplifies not the didactic, overly politicized American painting of the 1930s nor the propagandistic version perverted and promoted by authoritarian governments everywhere, but that of Gustave Courbet's 1855 demonstration of a 'realist allegory' -- of that desire to portray representative figures and situations that suggest the actualities of modern life.\\" Wurm's paintings are sometimes painted with single images, and sometimes with \\"double exposure\\" style images in which figures occupy more than one position on the canvas. In reference to Wurm's layered painting style, Miller writes \\"the figments of previous presences hover like ghosts, crowding the scene with an unexplained history.\\" These unexplained figures create a space for viewers to build their own meaning and identify with the image individually. The paintings reveal \\"the public and private aspects of a relationship\\", and invite the viewer to become a part of that relationship or interaction. The scenes commonly present figures in motion, encouraging viewers to sense a \\"weighty, something's-going-to-happen feeling, or a sight sense of the bizarre or surreal.\\" Wurm‚Äôs work was first placed in the context of Bay Area Figurative Painting in an exhibition at the University of California San Diego‚Äôs Mandeville Art Gallery, which showcased Joan Brown, Roy De Forest, and Robert Colescott. In 1985, Boettger wrote \\"Her flattened, expressively outlined forms also merge the expressionistic and realist approaches to figuration, which are both prominently associated with the art of the San Francisco Bay region since World War II.\\" While the California painting scene has strongly influenced Wurm's work, her ties to modernist European painting styles are undeniable. In a 2001 Artweek article, Josef Woodard wrote \\"Echoes of the Expressionists from the \\"Neue Sachlichkeit\\" school, especially Max Beckmann's style, provide a paradigm for Wurm's paintings, both as social statements and in terms of a rough, slashing painting attack that disguises an underscoring beauty.\\" Jan Wurm's narrative drawing has most recently been presented within a fundamental context of Los Angeles artists Charles Garabedian, Martin Lubner, and Pierre Picot at the Carl Cherry Center for the Arts exhibition, \\"Off Center.\\" The idiosyncratic work crosses categories and styles to establish new visual vocabulary. In the view of Cherry Center director, Robert Reese, the task of the work is \\"to paint what it means to be human in a place advertised as paradise.\\" Suzanne Muchnic contextualized the work as indicative of the all-American lifestyle, writing \\"If you dug these paintings up a thousand years from now, you'd have a fair idea of American middle-class mentality in the mid-20th century.\\" Under the brush of Jan Wurm, even the most costumed and innocuous of male sportsmanship as golf can be distilled into a display of male power and assertion as noted in \\"Man as Object: Reversing the Gaze. Curator Sinem Banna notes how Wurm's work \\"flows between painting and drawing just as her visual language bridges abstraction and figuration.\\"  Collections and archives  The artist‚Äôs archives are maintained in the United States by the Library of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington DC and in Britain by the National Art Library in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Her artwork is in public collections including the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, the New York Public Library Print Collection, the Universit√§t f√ºr Angewante Kunst in Vienna, University of California, Tiroler Landesmuseen, Moderne Galerie / Graphische Sammlungen, Innsbruck The series of watercolors developed for the Ladengalerie exhibition ‚ÄúDas Tier‚Äù are now part of the Archive Verein der Berliner K√ºnstlerinnen and documented in \\"Torso,\\" the third volume of an historical survey of women artists in Berlin.

All three were members of the Bolshevik faction before the Russian Revolution. Old Bolshevik (, stary bolshevik), also called Old Bolshevik Guard or Old Party Guard, was an unofficial designation for a member of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party before the Russian Revolution of 1917. Many Old Bolsheviks became leading politicians and bureaucrats in the Soviet Union and the ruling Communist Party until most had died from natural causes or were removed from power in the Great Purge by the late 1930s. Overview =Definition= Initially, the term \\"Old Bolshevik\\" (—Å—Ç–∞ÃÅ—Ä—ã–π –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≤–∏ÃÅ–∫, stary bolshevik) referred to Bolsheviks who joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party before 1905.

The first Statute required membership before January 1, 1905, with admission in some cases of other Social Democrats with the same career time who later joined the Bolsheviks. Initially there were 64 members. Later it was renamed into the All-Union Society. The 1931 Statute had requirement of continuous party membership of at least 18 years, with exceptions to be granted by the Society Presidium (approved by the Society Council). By 1934 there were over 2000 members. The All-Union Society was self-dissolved in 1935 announcing that \\"it has completed its tasks\\".Great Soviet Encyclopedia, article \\"–û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—Ö –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≤–∏–∫–æ–≤\\" Vadim Rogovin cites the statistics published by the 13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), that in 1924, of 600,000 Party members, 0.6% joined before 1905, 2% joined in 1906‚Äì1916 and <9% joined in 1917.Vadim Rogovin, Was There An Alternative?

Over time the definition of \\"Old Bolsheviks\\" has become more lax. For example, according to a 1972 Soviet book by D. A.

By the mid-1930s, General Secretary Joseph Stalin and the upper ranks of the party were predicting that major social upheaval would occur in the aftermath of the forced collectivization process since 1928 and the subsequent Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. Stalin, himself an Old Bolshevik, became paranoid of challenges to his rule from within the party, fearing that Old Bolsheviks were potential usurpers who could exploit the upheaval and use their prestige to depose him. Stalin used the assassination of Sergei Kirov in 1934 as a pretext to purge the party, and removed a great part of the surviving Old Bolsheviks from positions of power during the Great Purge from 1936 to 1938. Purged Old Bolsheviks were condemned in a series of show trials known as the Moscow Trials, and then executed for treason or sent as prisoners to the Gulag system of labor camps. By 1938, the number of Old Bolsheviks who remained in power (other than Stalin himself) was small, and the vacant positions were filled by a younger generation of party members who were considered to be more loyal to Stalin himself. Various things in the Soviet Union had the name Old Bolshevik, such as a publishing house, several steamships, motorboats, kolkhozes and populated places. –ü–æ–¥–≤–∏–≥ —ç–∫–∏–ø–∞–∂–∞ –ø–∞—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∞ ‚Äú–°—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–π –ë–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≤–∏–∫‚Äù Victory of crew of \\"Stari Bolshevik\\" (in Russian) (Article about one of 5 steamships called \\"Old Bolshevik\\" or \\"Stari Bolshevik)–ü–µ—á–∞—Ç—å –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ –≤ 1917 –≥–æ–¥—É : –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–æ—Ä—å–±—ã –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–π –≤ –ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–∏ (in Russian).

The reforms consisted of changing or removing key institutions that helped Stalin hold power: the cult of personality that surrounded him, the Stalinist political system, and the Gulag labour-camp system, all of which had been created by Stalin. These reforms were started by the collective leadership which succeeded him after his death in March 1953, consisting of Georgi Malenkov, Premier of the Soviet Union; Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Ministry of the Interior; and Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).  Terminology issues  The term de-Stalinization is one which gained currency in both Russia and the Western world following the collapse of the Soviet Union, but was never used during the Khrushchev era. However, de- Stalinization efforts were set forth at this time by Nikita Khrushchev and the Government of the Soviet Union under the guise of the \\"overcoming/exposure of the cult of personality\\", with a heavy criticism of Joseph Stalin's \\"era of the cult of personality\\". However, prior to Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\" to the 20th Party Congress, no direct association between Stalin as a person and \\"the cult of personality\\" was openly made by Khrushchev or others within the party, although archival documents show that strong criticism of Stalin and his ideology featured in private discussions by Khruschchev at the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.  \\"Silent de-Stalinization\\"  There were dangers in denouncing Stalin as he was placed on a pedestal both at home and among communists abroad. In the years 1953‚Äì1955, a period of \\"silent de- Stalinization\\" took place, as the revision of Stalin's policies was done in secret, and often with no explanation. This period saw a number of non- publicized political rehabilitations, by way of persons and groups such as Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Politburo members Robert Eikhe and JƒÅnis Rudzutaks, those executed in the Leningrad Affair, and the release of \\"Article 58ers\\". However, due to the huge influx of prisoners returning from the camps (90,000 prisoners in 1954‚Äì55 alone), this could not continue. In December 1955 Khrushchev proposed that a commission be set up in order to investigate Stalin's activities on behalf of the Presidium. This investigation determined that out of the 1,920,635 arrested for anti-Soviet activities ‚Äì who were often arrested on fabricated evidence in the first place and confessed under torture authorized by Stalin ‚Äì 688,503 were executed ‚Äì 35.8 per cent.  Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\"  O kulcie jednostki i jego nastƒôpstwach, Warsaw, March 1956, first edition of the Secret Speech, published for the inner use in the PUWP De-Stalinization meant an end to the role of large-scale forced labour in the economy. The process of freeing Gulag prisoners was started by Lavrentiy Beria. He was soon removed from power, arrested on 26 June 1953, and executed on 24 December 1953. Nikita Khrushchev emerged as the most powerful Soviet politician. While de-Stalinization had been quietly underway ever since Stalin's death, the watershed event was Khrushchev's speech entitled \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\", concerning Stalin. On 25 February 1956, he spoke to a closed session of the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivering an address laying out some of Stalin's crimes and the \\"conditions of insecurity, fear, and even desperation\\" created by Stalin. Khrushchev shocked his listeners by denouncing Stalin's dictatorial rule and his cult of personality as inconsistent with communist and Party ideology. Among other points, he condemned the treatment of the Old Bolsheviks, people who had supported communism before the revolution, many of whom Stalin had executed as traitors. Khrushchev also attacked the crimes committed by associates of Beria. = Motivation = One reason given for Khrushchev's speech was his moral conscience; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said that Khrushchev spoke out of a \\"movement of the heart\\". This, the Communists believed, would prevent a fatal loss of self-belief and restore unity within the Party. Martin McCauley argues that Khrushchev's purpose was to \\"liberate Party officials from the fear of repression\\". Khrushchev argued that if the Party were to be an efficient mechanism, stripped from the brutal abuse of power by any individual, it could transform the Soviet Union as well as the entire world. However, others have suggested that the speech was made in order to deflect blame from the Communist Party or the principles of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and place the blame squarely on Stalin's shoulders, thus preventing a more radical debate. However, the publication of this speech caused many party members to resign in protest, both abroad and within the Soviet Union. By attacking Stalin, McCauley argues, he was undermining the credibility of Vyacheslav Molotov, Georgy Malenkov, Lazar Kaganovich and other political opponents who had been within \\"Stalin's inner circle\\" during the 1930s more than he had been. If they did not \\"come over to Khrushchev\\", they \\"risk[ed] being banished with Stalin\\" and associated with his dictatorial control.  Changes  = Prisons = The amnesty decree of March 1953 began the release of most prisoners. Former political prisoners often faced ingrained hostility upon their return, which made it difficult to reintegrate into normal life. Nanci Adler, The Gulag Survivor: Beyond the Soviet System (2002) On 25 October 1956, a resolution of the CPSU declared that the existence of the Gulag labour system was \\"inexpedient\\".Memorial http://www.memo.ru/history/nkvd/gulag/Articles/chapter3main.htm The Gulag institution was closed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) order No 020 of 25 January 1960.Memorial http://www.memo.ru/history/NKVD/GULAG/r1/r1-4.htm For those who remained, Khrushchev attempted to make the Gulag labour system less harsh, by allowing prisoners to post letters home to their families, and by allowing family members to mail clothes to prisoners, which was not allowed under Stalin. = Re-naming of places and buildings = Khrushchev renamed or reverted the names of many places bearing Stalin's name, including cities, territories, landmarks, and other facilities. The State Anthem of the Soviet Union was purged of references to Stalin, and so were the anthems of its republics. The Stalin-centric and World War II-era lines in the lyrics were effectively excised when an instrumental version replaced it. The Joseph Stalin Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, Poland was renamed in 1956. Stalin Peak, the highest point in the USSR, was renamed Communism Peak. After the collapse of the USSR, the mountain was renamed Ismoil Somoni Peak. = Destruction of monuments = Statue of Stalin on Stalinallee in Berlin- Friedrichshain was removed in 1961. The Yerevan monument was removed in spring 1962 and replaced by Mother Armenia in 1967. Thousands of Stalin monuments have been destroyed not only in the Soviet Union, but in other former Communist countries as well. In November 1961, the large Stalin Statue on Berlin's monumental Stalinallee (promptly renamed Karl-Marx-Allee) was removed in a clandestine operation. The Monument in Budapest was destroyed in October 1956. The biggest one, the Prague monument, was taken down in November 1962. = Re-location of Stalin's body = Given momentum by these public re- namings, the process of de-Stalinization peaked in 1961 during the 22nd Congress of the CPSU. Two climactic acts of de-Stalinization marked the meetings: first, on 31 October 1961, Stalin's body was moved from Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square to a location near the Kremlin wall; second, on 11 November 1961, the \\"hero city\\" Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd. = Foreign policy changes after Stalin = The Stalin era ended with the appointment of Nikita Khrushchev, who defined Soviet foreign policy after Stalin and entering into the Cold War. The biggest change to foreign policy dealt with \\"uncommitted nations\\". There were two types of neutrality according to the Soviets, those by ideology and those by circumstance. Many of the nations that were neutral came from both of these groups and were former colonies of European powers. During Stalin there was no room for neutral countries and the idea of neutral powers came about under Khrushchev. Khrushchev's biggest contribution to foreign policy is taking advantage of other aspects of de- Stalinisation to try and show the world a different Soviet Union more in line with traditional socialist ideals.  Extent of de-Stalinization  Contemporary historians regard the beginning of de-Stalinization as a turning point in the history of the Soviet Union that began during the Khrushchev Thaw. It subsided during the Brezhnev period until the mid-1980s, and accelerated again with the policies of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail Gorbachev. De-Stalinization has been considered a fragile process. Historian Polly Jones said that \\"re-Stalinization\\" was highly likely after a brief period of \\"thaw\\". Anne Applebaum agrees: \\"The era which came to be called the 'Thaw' was indeed an era of change, but change of a particular kind: reforms took two steps forward, and then one step‚Äîor sometimes three steps‚Äîback.\\"  See also  *History of the Soviet Union (1953‚Äì1964): de-Stalinzation and the Khrushchev era *Decommunization  References  Further reading * Dobson, Miriam. \\"The post-Stalin era: de-Stalinization, daily life, and dissent.\\" Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 12.4 (2011): 905‚Äì924. online * Filtzer, Donald.

After a period of debate, a vote is taken. If one vote clearly wins (gaining a share of 60% or above among two options, for example) all party members are expected to follow that decision, and not continue propagandizing or otherwise working against it, aiming to act in unity. In the development of socialism in the Soviet Union and China, it was largely taken up in response to dramatic developments and violence which required faster mechanisms of decision-making. A constellation of practices surround this in order to encourage participation and debate, such as Don't Blame the Speaker.  Vladimir Lenin's conception and practice  The text What Is to Be Done? from 1902 is popularly seen as the founding text of democratic centralism. At this time, democratic centralism was generally viewed as a set of principles for the organizing of a revolutionary workers' party. However, Vladimir Lenin's model for such a party, which he repeatedly discussed as being \\"democratic centralist\\", was the German Social Democratic Party, inspired by remarks made by the social democrat Jean Baptista von Schweitzer. Lenin described democratic centralism as consisting of \\"freedom of discussion, unity of action\\". The doctrine of democratic centralism served as one of the sources of the split between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The Mensheviks supported a looser party discipline within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1903 as did Leon Trotsky, in Our Political Tasks, although Trotsky joined ranks with the Bolsheviks in 1917. The Sixth Party Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) held at Petrograd between 26 July and 3 August 1917 defined democratic centralism as follows: # That all directing bodies of the Party, from top to bottom, shall be elected. # That Party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective Party organizations. # That there shall be strict Party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority. # That all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all Party members.History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) (1939). New York City: International Publishers. p. 198. After the successful consolidation of power by the Communist Party following the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War, the Bolshevik leadership, including Lenin, instituted a ban on factions in the party as Resolution No. 12 of the 10th Party Congress in 1921. It was passed in the morning session on 16 March 1921.Protokoly (1933). ed. 585‚Äì7; 1963 ed. 571‚Äì573. Trotskyists sometimes claim that this ban was intended to be temporary, but there is no language in the discussion at the 10th Party Congress suggesting such.Protokoly (1933) ed. 523‚Äì548. The Group of Democratic Centralism was a group in the Soviet Communist Party who advocated different concepts of party democracy.  Arguments for  In On Party Unity, Lenin argued that democratic centralism prevents factionalism. He argued that factionalism leads to less friendly relations among members and that it can be exploited by enemies of the party. By the Brezhnev period, democratic centralism was described in the 1977 Soviet Constitution as a principle for organizing the state: \\"The Soviet state is organized and functions on the principle of democratic centralism, namely the electiveness of all bodies of state authority from the lowest to the highest, their accountability to the people, and the obligation of lower bodies to observe the decisions of higher ones\\". Democratic centralism combines central leadership with local initiative and creative activity and with the responsibility of each state body and official for the work entrusted to them.  Soviet practice  For much of the time between the era of Joseph Stalin and the 1980s, the principle of democratic centralism meant that the Supreme Soviet, while nominally vested with great lawmaking powers, did little more than approve decisions already made at the highest levels of the Communist Party. When the Supreme Soviet was not in session, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet performed its ordinary functions. Nominally, if such decrees were not ratified by the full Supreme Soviet, they were considered revoked. However, ratification was usually a mere formality, though occasionally even this formality was not observed. Thus, decisions made by the Party's top leaders de facto had the force of law. The democratic centralist principle extended to elections in the Soviet Union. All Communist countries were‚Äîeither de jure or de facto‚Äîone-party states. In most cases, the voters were presented with a single list of unopposed candidates, which usually won 90 percent or more of the vote. In some countries, those who did not vote for the lone candidate on the ballot could face serious reprisals.Nohlen, Dieter; St√∂ver, Philip, eds. (2010). Elections in Europe: A Data Handbook. Nomos. p. 457. .  China  Democratic centralism is also stated in Article 3 of the present Constitution of the People's Republic of China: > Article 3.

Workplace democracy is implemented in a variety of ways, dependent on the size, culture, and other variables of an organization. Workplace democracy can be anything from direct democracy to employers asking opinions of employees without taking into consideration their beliefs and opinions. Advantages and arguments for =Economic argument= From as early as the 1920s, scholars have been exploring the idea of increasing employee participation and involvement. They sought to learn if whether including employees in organizational decision-making would lead to increased effectiveness and productivity within the organization. According to Lewin, individuals who are involved in decision-making also have increased openness to change. Different participative techniques can have either a stronger impact on morale than productivity, while others have the reverse effect. Success of the employee-owned and operated Mondragon suggests economic benefits from workplace democracy. =Citizenship argument= Workplace democracy acts as an agent to encourage public participation in a government's political process. Skills developed from democracy in the workplace can transfer to improved citizenship and result in a better functioning democracy. Workers in a democratic environment may also develop a greater concern from the common good, which also transfers to fundamental citizenship. =Ethical justification= Making workplaces more democratic is the \\"right\\" thing to do. Philosopher Robert Dahl claims that 'if democracy is justified in governing the state, it must also be justified in governing economic enterprises'. =Employee power and representation= Workers working for democratic leaders report positive results such as group member satisfaction, friendliness, group mindedness, 'we' statements, worker motivation, creativity, and dedication to decisions made within an organization.Northouse, P. G. (2015). Introduction to leadership: Concepts and practice (3rd ed). Kalamazoo, MI: SAGE Publications. 978-1-4833-1276-7 When workplace democracy is used the effect typically is raised employee potential, employee representation, higher autonomy, and equal power within an organization (Rolfsen, 2011). Political association Workplace democracy theory closely follows political democracy, especially in larger workplaces. Democratic workplace organization is often associated with trade unions, anarchist, and socialist (especially libertarian socialist) movements. Most unions have democratic structures at least for selecting the leader, and sometimes these are seen as providing the only democratic aspects to the workplace. However, not every workplace that lacks a union lacks democracy, and not every workplace that has a union necessarily has a democratic way to resolve disputes Historically, some unions have been more committed to workplace democracy than others. The Industrial Workers of the World pioneered the archetypal workplace democracy model, the Wobbly Shop, in which recallable delegates were elected by workers, and other norms of grassroots democracy were applied. This is still used in some organizations, notably Semco and in the software industry. Spanish anarchists, Mohandas Gandhi's Swadeshi movement, farm and retail co-operative movements, all made contributions to the theory and practice of workplace democracy and often carried that into the political arena as a \\"more participatory democracy.\\" The Green parties worldwide have adopted workplace democracy as a central platform, and also often mimic workplace democracy norms such as gender equity, co-leadership, deliberative democracy applied to any major decision, and leaders who don't do policy. The Democratic socialist parties have supported the notion of workplace democracy and democratically controlled institutions. The best known and most studied example of a successfully democratic national labor union in the United States are the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, known throughout the labor movement as the UE. An independent trade Union, the UE was built from the bottom-up, and takes pride in its motto that \\"The Members Run This Union!\\" In Sweden, the Swedish Social Democratic Party made laws and reforms from 1950-70 to establish more democratic workplaces. Salvador Allende championed a large number of such experiments in Chile when he became president of Chile in 1970. Studies by management science There are many management science papers on the application of democratic structuring to the workplace, and its benefits. Benefits are often contrasted to simple command hierarchy arrangements in which \\"the boss\\" can hire anyone and fire anyone, and takes absolute and total responsibility for his own well-being and also all that occurs \\"under\\" him. The command hierarchy is a preferred management style followed in many companies for its simplicity, speed and low process overheads. London Business School chief, Nigel Nicholson, in his 1998 Harvard Business Review paper: \\"How Hardwired is Human Behavior?\\" suggested that human nature was just as likely to cause problems in the workplace as in larger social and political settings, and that similar methods were required to deal with stressful situations and difficult problems. He held up the workplace democracy model advanced by Ricardo Semler as the \\"only\\" one that actually took cognizance of human foibles. =Influenced matrix management= Managerial grid models and matrix management, compromises between true workplace democracy and conventional top- down hierarchy, became common in the 1990s. These models cross responsibilities so that no one manager had total control of any one employee, or so that technical and marketing management were not subordinated to each other but had to argue out their concerns more mutually. A consequence of this was the rise of learning organization theory, in which the ontology of definitions in common among all factions or professions becomes the main management problem. Current approaches =Limits on management= Many organizations began by the 1960s to realize that tight control by too few people was encouraging groupthink, increasing turnover in staff and a loss of morale among qualified people helpless to appeal what they saw as misguided, uninformed, or poorly thought-out decisions. Often employees who publicly criticize such poor decision making of their higher management are penalized or even fired from their jobs on some pretext or other. The comic strip Dilbert has become popular satirizing this type of oblivious management, iconically represented by the Pointy-haired Boss, a nameless and clueless social climber. The Dilbert principle has been accepted as fact by some. Much management philosophy has focused on trying to limit manager power, differentiate leadership versus management, and so on. Henry Mintzberg, Peter Drucker and Donella Meadows were three very notable theorists addressing these concerns in the 1980s. Mintzberg and Drucker studied how executives spent their time, Meadows how change and leverage to resist it existed at all levels in all kinds of organizations. Adhocracy, functional leadership models and reengineering were all attempts to detect and remove administrative incompetence. Business process and quality management methods in general remove managerial flexibility that is often perceived as masking managerial mistakes, but also preventing transparency and facilitating fraud, as in the case of Enron. Had managers been more accountable to employees, it is argued, owners and employees would not have been defrauded. = Codetermination = German law specifically mandates democratic worker participation in the oversight of workplaces with 2000 or more employees. Similar laws exist in Denmark for businesses with more than 20 workers and France for businesses with more than 5000 workers. = Staff and Worker Representative Congresses = In China, a form of workplace democracy is mandated by law for state-owned enterprises.http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/article/lawsdata/chineselaw/200303/20030300072563.shtml. This is done through Staff and Worker Representative Congresses (SWRCs), composed of workers directly elected by all workers in the workplace to represent them.http://bellschool.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/IPS/PSC/CCC/publications/papers/Anita_Staff_and_Workers_Rep_Congress_pdf.pdf = Examples of companies organized by workplace democracy = Mondragon The Mondragon Cooperative Corporation is the largest worker cooperative in the world, and as such the largest corporation that operates some form of workplace democracy. The Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff states it is \\"a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production\\".Wolff, Richard (24 June 2012). Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way. The Guardian. Retrieved 12 August 2013. Marland Mold Marland Mold was a company started in 1946 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, by Severino Marchetto and Paul Ferland. The company at first, designed and built steel molds for plastic products throughout the 1950s and 60s. In 1969 the owners sold the company to VCA which was later bought by The Ethyl Corporation. The Marland Mold employees voted to join the International Union of Electrical Workers, because of a dispute that took place over health insurance. The plant's manager started to pay less attention and put less time into the Pittsfield plant so the profits declined. The plant was put up for sale in 1992. The employees ended up buying out the plant, even though they weren't fans of employee ownership before, they needed to save their jobs. There immediately was a burst in production and they were able to produce molds that normally took the 3000 hours to make in 2200 hours. They had financial stake in the company now which gave them new motivation for the company's success. The other two ideas that were key components to their success was the education of all members about their new roles, and building an ownership culture within the organization. In 1995, they had officially bought all ownership stock and buyout lenders and the company was completely employee owned. Through all of this employees were also able to gain a broader perspective on the company, like being able to understand others views of different conflicts in the workplace. In 2007, Marland Mold celebrated their 15th anniversary of employee ownership. In 2010 Marland Mold were acquired by Curtil. In 2017 the Pittsfield plant was shut. Semco In the 1980s, Brazilian businessman Ricardo Semler, converted his family firm, a light manufacturing concern called Semco, and transformed it into a strictly democratic establishment where managers were interviewed and then elected by workers. All managerial decisions were subject to democratic review, debate and vote, with the full participation of all workers. This radical approach to management got him and the company a great deal of attention. Semler argued that handing the company over to the workers was the only way to free time for himself to go build up the customer, government and other relationships required to make the company grow. By giving up the fight to hold any control of internals, Semler was able to focus on marketing, positioning, and offer his advice (as a paid, elected spokesman, though his position as major shareholder was not so negotiable) as if he were, effectively, an outside management consultant hired by the company. Decentralization of management functions, he claimed, gave him a combination of insider information and outsider credibility, plus the legitimacy of truly speaking for his workers in the same sense as an elected political leader.

A report looking at research on democratic workplaces in the USA, Europe and Latin America found workplace democracy had staff working 'better and smarter' with production organized more efficiently. They were also able to organize more efficiently on a larger scale and in more capital-intensive industries than hierarchical workplaces. A 1987 study of democratic workplaces in Italy, the UK and France found that workplace democracy has a positive relationship with productivity and that democratic firms do not get less productive as they get larger. A report on democratic workplaces in the USA found that they can increase worker incomes by 70-80%, that they can grow 2% faster a year than other businesses and have 9-19% greater levels of productivity, 45% lower turnover rates and a 30% less likely to fail in the first few years of operation. A 1995 study of workplace democracy in the timber industry in the Northwest United States found that productivity increased by 6 to 14% with workplace democracy. A 2006 meta-study on workplace democracy found that it can 'equal or exceed the productivity of conventional enterprises when employee involvement is combined with ownership' and 'enrich local social capital.' = Effects on business longevity = According to an analysis, businesses with democratic workplaces in British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec in the 2000s were almost half as likely as businesses with hierarchical workplaces to fail in ten years. According to an analysis of all businesses in Uruguay between 1997 - 2009, businesses with democratic workplaces have a 29% smaller chance of closure than other firms. In Italy, businesses with democratic workplaces that have been created by workers buying a business when it's facing a closure or put up to sale have a 3 year survival rate of 87%, compared to 48% of all Italian businesses. In 2005, 1% of German businesses failed but the statistic for businesses with democratic workplaces was less than 0.1%. A 2012 study of Spanish and French businesses with democratic workplaces found that they ‚Äúhave been more resilient than conventional enterprises during the economic crisis.\\" In France, the three year survival rate of businesses with democratic workplaces is 80%-90%, compared to the 66% overall survival rate for all businesses. During the 2008 economic crisis, the number of workers in businesses with democratic workplaces in France increased by 4.2%, while employment in other businesses decreased by 0.7%. = Effects on Workers = Overall, the effects on workplace democracy on workers seems to be positive. A 2018 study from South Korea found that workers had higher motivation in democratic workplaces. A 2014 study from Italy found that democratic workplaces were the only kind of workplace which increased trust between workers. A 2013 study from the United States found that democratic workplaces in the healthcare industry had significantly higher levels of job satisfaction. 2011 study in France found that democratic workplaces ‚Äúhad a positive effect on workers‚Äô job satisfaction.‚Äù A 2019 meta-study indicates that ‚Äúthe impact [of democratic workplaces] on the happiness workers is generally positive‚Äù. A 1995 study from the United States indicates that ‚Äúemployees who embrace an increased influence and participation in workplace decisions also reported greater job satisfaction‚Äù. One 2012 study of three Italian towns of similar demographics, income and geography found that towns with more democratic workplaces had: # Better mental and physical health, and longer lives, with less strokes and heart attacks. # Children that were less likely to skip school and skipped school less. # Less crime, including less domestic violence and greater feelings of safety among citizens. # Higher rates of ‚Äòsocial participation‚Äô (joining clubs and charities; giving blood; voting). # Perception of a more positive society, more supportive personal networks and more trust in the government.

It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small affinity group based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.  Origins and evolution  = 19th century = An influential individualist concept of insurrection appears in the book of Max Stirner, The Ego and Its Own from 1844. There he manifests: Mikhail Bakunin \\"was historically important to the development of an anarchism that focused its force in insurrection. Unlike Marx, who built his support in the First International, mostly within the central executive structure, Bakunin worked to build support for co-ordinated action through autonomous insurrections at the base, especially in Southern Europe. And since Bakunin's time insurrectionary anarchists have been concentrated in Southern Europe.\\"\\"Insurrectionary Anarchy: Organising for Attack! \\" by Do or Die Issue 10. pp. 258‚Äì266. Later in 1876, at the Berne conference of the First International, \\"the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta argued that the revolution \\"consists more of deeds than words\\", and that action was the most effective form of propaganda. In the bulletin of the Jura Federation he declared \\"the Italian federation believes that the insurrectional fact, destined to affirm socialist principles by deed, is the most efficacious means of propaganda.\\" As anarcho-communism emerged in the mid 19th century it had an intense debate with Bakuninist collectivism and as such within the anarchist movement over participation in syndicalism and the workers movement as well as on other issues.\\"This inability to break definitively with collectivism in all its forms also exhibited itself over the question of the workers' movement, which divided anarchist-communism into a number of tendencies.\\"\\"Anarchist- Communism\\" by Alain Pengam So \\"In the theory of the revolution\\" of anarcho- communism as elaborated by Peter Kropotkin and others \\"it is the risen people who are the real agent and not the working class organised in the enterprise (the cells of the capitalist mode of production) and seeking to assert itself as labour power, as a more 'rational' industrial body or social brain (manager) than the employers.\\" So \\"between 1880 and 1890\\" with the \\"perspective of an immanent revolution\\", who was \\"opposed to the official workers' movement, which was then in the process of formation (general Social Democratisation). They were opposed not only to political (statist) struggles but also to strikes which put forward wage or other claims, or which were organised by trade unions.\\" But \\"While they were not opposed to strikes as such, they were opposed to trade unions and the struggle for the eight-hour day. This anti-reformist tendency was accompanied by an anti-organisational tendency, and its partisans declared themselves in favour of agitation amongst the unemployed for the expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles, for the expropriatory strike and, in some cases, for 'individual recuperation' or acts of terrorism.\\" = Narodnism and Russian populism = The Narodniks were a politically conscious movement of the Russian middle class in the 1860s and 1870s, some of whom became involved in revolutionary agitation against tsarism. Their ideology was known as Narodnichestvo (–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ), from the Russian –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥, narod, \\"people, folk\\", so it is sometimes translated as \\"peopleism\\" or more commonly \\"populism\\". A common slogan among the Narodniks was \\"—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥\\", khozhdeniye v narod, \\"going to the people\\". Though their movement achieved little in its own time, the Narodniks were in many ways the intellectual and political forebears of the socialist revolutionaries who went on to greatly influence Russian history in the 20th century. Narodnaya Volya's program contained the following demands: convocation of a Constituent Assembly (for designing a Constitution); introduction of universal suffrage; permanent people's representation, freedom of speech, press, and assembly; communal self-government; exchange of the permanent army with a people's volunteer corps; transfer of land to the people; gradual placement of the factories under the control of the workers; and granting oppressed peoples of the Russian Empire the right to self-determination. Narodnaya Volya's program was a mix of democratic and socialist reforms. Narodnaya Volya differed from its parent organization, the narodnik Zemlya i volya, in that its members had come to believe that a social revolution would be impossible in the absence of a political revolution; the peasantry could not take possession of the land as long as the government remained autocratic. One response to this repression was the formation of Russia's first organized revolutionary party, Narodnaya Volya (\\"People's Will\\"), in June 1879. It favored the use secret society-led terrorism as an attempt to violently destabilize the Russian Empire and provide a focus for popular discontent against it for an insurrection, justified ‚Äúas a means of exerting pressure on the government for reform, as the spark that would ignite a vast peasant uprising, and as the inevitable response to the regime's use of violence against the revolutionaries‚Äù. The group developed ideas‚Äîsuch as targeted killing of the 'leaders of oppression'‚Äîthat were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age‚Äîsuch as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of‚Äîenabled them to strike directly and with discrimination. Much of the organization's philosophy was inspired by Sergei Nechayev and \\"propaganda by the deed\\" theorist Carlo Pisacane. The attempt to get the peasantry to overthrow the Tsar proved unsuccessful, due to the peasantry's idolisation of the latter as someone \\"on their side\\". Narodism therefore developed the practice of terrorism: the peasantry, they believed, had to be shown that the Tsar was not supernatural, and could be killed. This theory, called \\"direct struggle\\", intended \\"uninterrupted demonstration of the possibility of struggling against the government, in this manner lifting the revolutionary spirit of the people and its faith in the success of the cause, and organising those capable of fighting\\". On March 1, 1881, they succeeded in assassinating Alexander II. This act backfired on a political level, because the peasantry were generally horrified by the murder, and the government had many Narodnaya Volya leaders hanged, leaving the group unorganized and ineffective. = Resistance and propaganda by the deed = Caricature of the Bonnot gang, the most famous of the French illegalist groups After Peter Kropotkin along with others decided to enter labor unions after their initial reservations, there remained \\"the anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists, who in France were grouped around Sebastien Faure's Le Libertaire. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'.\\" Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it \\"The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (\\"propaganda by the deed\\") and the anarchist burglars (\\"individual reappropriation\\") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt.\\" In late April 1919, at least 36 booby trap dynamite-filled bombs were mailed to a cross-section of prominent politicians and appointees, including the Attorney General of the United States, as well as justice officials, newspaper editors and businessmen, including John D. Rockefeller. Among all the bombs addressed to high-level officials, one bomb was addressed to the home of a Department of Justice Bureau of Investigation (BOI) field agent once tasked with investigating the Galleanists, Rayme Weston Finch, who in 1918 had arrested two prominent Galleanists while leading a police raid on the offices of their publication Cronaca Sovversiva. Luigi Galleani Such acts of rebellion, which could be individual were in the long run seen as act of rebellion, which could ignite en masse insurrection leading to revolution. Proponents and activists of these tactics among others included Johann Most, Luigi Galleani, Victor Serge, and Severino Di Giovanni. \\"In Argentina, these tendencies flourished at the end of the 20s and during the 30s, years of acute repression and of flinching of the once powerful workers movement ‚Äìthis was a desperate, though heroic, of a decadent movement.\\"\\"Notes on the article 'Anarchism, Insurrections and Insurrectionalism'\\" by Collin Sick The Italian Giuseppe Ciancabilla (1872‚Äì1904) wrote in \\"Against organization\\" that \\"we don't want tactical programs, and consequently we don't want organization. Having established the aim, the goal to which we hold, we leave every anarchist free to choose from the means that his sense, his education, his temperament, his fighting spirit suggest to him as best. We don't form fixed programs and we don't form small or great parties. But we come together spontaneously, and not with permanent criteria, according to momentary affinities for a specific purpose, and we constantly change these groups as soon as the purpose for which we had associated ceases to be, and other aims and needs arise and develop in us and push us to seek new collaborators, people who think as we do in the specific circumstance.\\"\\"Against organization\\" by Giuseppe Ciancabilla. Retrieved 2010-06-10. Nevertheless, he also says \\"We do not oppose the organizers. They will continue, if they like, in their tactic. If, as I think, it will not do any great good, it will not do any great harm either. But it seems to me that they have writhed throwing their cry of alarm and blacklisting us either as savages or as theoretical dreamers.\\" An article by eco-anarchist magazine Do or Die manifests that \\"This is a debate that has gone on and still goes on within the insurrectionary anarchist circles; Renzo Novatore stood for individual revolt, Errico Malatesta for social struggle, whilst Luigi Galleani believed there was no contradiction between the two.\\" = Contemporary approaches = A resurgence of such ideas for Joe Black happened \\"in the peculiar conditions of post war Italy and Greece\\". \\"Towards the end of World War II there was a real possibility of revolution in both countries.\\" \\"Greece was to suffer decades of military dictatorship while in Italy the Communist Party continued to hold back struggles. Insurrectionalism was one of a number of new socialist ideologies which arose to address these particular circumstances.\\" In Italy a tendency that did not identify either with the more classical Italian Anarchist Federation or with the platformist inclined (GAAP Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action) started to emerge as local groups. These groups emphasized direct action, informal affinity groups and expropriation for financing anarchist activity. From within these groups the influential Italian insurrectionary anarchist Alfredo Maria Bonanno will emerge influenced by the practice of the Spanish exiled anarchist Josep Llu√≠s i Facerias. Battle of Seattle\\" One insurrectionalist has described how the ideas spread from Italy: \\"Insurrectionary anarchism has been developing in the English language anarchist movement since the 1980s, thanks to translations and writings by Jean Weir in her Elephant Editions and her magazine Insurrection.... In Vancouver, Canada, local comrades involved in the Anarchist Black Cross, the local anarchist social center, and the magazines No Picnic and Endless Struggle were influenced by Jean's projects, and this carried over into the always developing practice of insurrectionary anarchists in this region today ... The anarchist magazine Demolition Derby in Montreal also covered some insurrectionary anarchist news back in the day.\\" Insurrectionalist ideas also spread to the New Left movement in the United States, often being present in various revolutionary terrorist organizations, such as the Weathermen, Black Liberation Army, and M19CO. Weathermen leader Bernardine Dohrn argued for violence, saying: \\"We've known that our job is to lead white kids into armed revolution. We never intended to spend the next five to twenty-five years of our lives in jail. Ever since SDS became revolutionary, we've been trying to show how it is possible to overcome frustration and impotence that comes from trying to reform this system. Kids know the lines are drawn: revolution is touching all of our lives. Tens of thousands have learned that protest and marches don't do it. Revolutionary violence is the only way.\\" Magazine Do or Die reports that \\"Much of the Italian insurrectionary anarchist critique of the movements of the '70s focused on the forms of organisation that shaped the forces of struggle and out of this a more developed idea of informal organisation grew. A critique of the authoritarian organisations of the '70s, whose members often believed they were in a privileged position to struggle as compared to the proletariat as a whole, was further refined in the struggles of the '80s, such as the early 1980s struggle against a military base that was to house nuclear weapons in Comiso, Sicily. Anarchists were very active in that struggle, which was organised into self-managed leagues.\\" Later in 1993 the Italian insurrectionary anarchist Alfredo Bonanno writes For An Anti- authoritarian Insurrectionalist International in which he proposes coordination between mediterranean insurrectionists after the period of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and civil war in the ex-Yugoslavia. WTO protests For Joe Black \\"That insurrectionalism should emerge as a more distinct trend in English language anarchism at this point in time should be no surprise. The massive boost anarchism received from the summit protest movement was in part due to the high visibility of black bloc style tactics.\\" In the USA Feral Faun (later writing as Wolfi Landstreicher and Apio Ludd) gained notoriety as he wrote articles that appeared in the post-left anarchy magazine Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. Feral Faun wrote in 1995, \\"In the game of insurgence‚Äîa lived guerilla war game‚Äîit is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them. So I, Feral Faun, became [...] an anarchist [...] a writer [...] a Stirner-influenced, post-situationist, anti-civilization theorist [...] if not in my own eyes, at least in the eyes of most people who've read my writings.\\" Also Wolfi Lanstreicher has translated works by Alfredo Maria Bonnanno and other similar writers such as the early 20th century Italian illegalist anarchists Renzo Novatore and Bruno Filippi as well as other insurrectionist texts. This shows how more recent theories have taken relevance within insurrectionary anarchist theory along the egoist anarchism of Max Stirner. This contemporary approach has relevance in other place such as Chile where in 2008 after a few incidents of bombs claimed by anarchist groups a group called Frente Anarquista Revolucionario (Anarchist Revolutionary Front) after correcting what they see as misunderstandings of their position they wrote in the same pamphlet how they have been influenced by the \\"postmodernists texts of Alfredo Bonnano, Wolfi Landstreicher, Constantino Cavalleri, Gustavo Rodr√≠guez, Alfredo Cospito, as well as other insurrectionary anonymous texts\\".\\"nuestra teor√≠a no la basamos de manera alguna en 'lo o√≠do o le√≠do por ah√≠', ya que hemos pasado gran parte de nuestro tiempo leyendo y discutiendo los textos postmodernistas de Alfredo Bonnano, Wolfi Landstreicher, etc√©tera, como tambi√©n adem√°s una caterva de textos insurreccionalistas an√≥nimos\\". \\"Aclaraci√≥n del Frente Anarquista Revolucionario\\" by Frente Anarquista Revolucionario, 20 December 2008 The contemporary imprisoned Italian insurrectionary anarchist philosopher Michele Fabiani writes from an explicit individualist anarchist perspective in such essays as \\"Critica individualista anarchica alla modernit√†\\" (Individualist anarchist critique of modernity) Anarchist graffiti during the 2008 Greek riots As was mentioned before, insurrectionary anarchist discourse also had relevance in Greece. In the 2008 Greek riots the old disputes between organizationalist and insurrectionary anarchists reappeared when there was a conflict \\"between insurrectionary anarchists associated with the Black Bloc, and the heavily organized Antiauthoritarian Movement (AK, in Greek) ... the schism between insurrectionists and the Antiauthoritarian Movement has even led to physical fighting.... People with AK bullied and beat up anarchists whom they suspected of stealing some computers from the university during an event AK organized, getting them in trouble. In response, some insurrectionists burned down the Antiauthoritarian Movement's offices in Thessaloniki.\\"\\"Insurrection vs. Organization. Reflections from Greece on a Pointless Schism\\" by Peter Gelderloos The Informal Anarchist Federation (not to be confused with the synthesist Italian Anarchist Federation also FAI ) is an Italian insurrectionary anarchist organization. It has been described by Italian intelligence sources as a \\"horizontal\\" structure of various anarchist terrorist groups, united in their beliefs in revolutionary armed action. In 2003, the group claimed responsibility for a bomb campaign targeting several European Union institutions. In 2010, Italy's postal service intercepted a threatening letter containing a bullet addressed to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. A large envelope containing a letter addressed to Berlusconi with the threat \\"you will end up like a rat\\" was discovered on Friday in a post office in the Libate suburb of the northern city of Milan. On 23 December 2010, credit for exploding parcels delivered to the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome was claimed by the Informal Anarchist Federation. Anarchists organizing a protest During the first years of the 2000s, the Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth in Spain started to evolve towards insurrectionary anarchist positions and its differences with anarcho- syndicalism became more evident due to the influence of the Black bloc in alterglobalization protests and the examples of developments from Italy and Greece. The FIJL faced repression from the state, which led to inactivity A new generation of anarchist youth decided to establish a new FIJL in 2006. It tried to establish a clear difference with the other insurrectionist FIJL while defending anarcho-syndicalism critically.Juventudes Anarquistas de Le√≥n, \\"La Teor√≠a de Cuerdas del Sindicalismo\\" o Grupo Bandera Negra \\"Lo que es y no es el 19 de julio\\" In 2007 it re-established itself as the FIJL since it did not have news from the other insurrectionist organization, but after finding out of a communique by the insurrectionist organization it decided to name itself \\"Iberian Federation of Anarchist Youth\\" (spa: Federaci√≥n Ib√©rica de Juventudes Anarquistas or FIJA) but knowing that they are the continuing organization to the previous FIJL from the 1990s. They publish a newspaper called El Fuelle. In march of 2012 the FIJL of insurrectionist tendencies decides to not continue and so the FIJA goes to call itself again FIJL.  Theory  A few main points can be identified within contemporary insurrectionary anarchism that go back to tactics employed by illegalism and propaganda by the deed anarchists. 1\\\\. \\"The concept of 'attack is at the heart of the insurrectionist ideology.\\" As such it is viewed that \\"It is through acting and learning to act, not propaganda, that we will open the path to insurrection.\\"\\"Some Notes on Insurrectionary Anarchism\\" although \\"propaganda has a role in clarifying how to act.\\" In the state of action is in the state that one learns. The Italian text Ai ferri corti says: \\"An individual with a passion for social upheaval and a 'personal' vision of the class clash wants to do something immediately. If he or she analyses the transformation of capital and the State it is in order to attack them, certainly not so as to be able to go to sleep with clearer ideas.\\" \\"Attack is the refusal of mediation, pacification, sacrifice, accommodation, and compromise in struggle.\\" 2\\\\. Insurrection(s) and Revolution: Revolution is seen as \\"a concrete event, it must be built daily through more modest attempts which do not have all the liberating characteristics of the social revolution in the true sense. These more modest attempts are insurrections. In them the uprising of the most exploited and excluded of society and the most politically sensitized minority opens the way to the possible involvement of increasingly wider strata of exploited on a flux of rebellion which could lead to revolution.\\" 3\\\\. \\"The self-management of struggle\\" as \\"those that struggle are autonomous in their decisions and actions; this is the opposite of an organization of synthesis which always attempts to take control of struggle. Struggles that are synthesized within a single controlling organization are easily integrated into the power structure of present society. Self-organized struggles are by nature uncontrollable when they are spread across the social terrain.\\" It is seen that the system and its institutions are afraid of rebellious acts becoming propaganda by the deed and thus making rebellion extend itself. \\"Small actions, therefore, easily reproducible, requiring unsophisticated means that are available to all, are by their very simplicity and spontaneity uncontrollable.\\" This also means that insurrectionary anarchists should not see themselves as a vanguard or as the conscious ones but just as part \\"of the exploited and excluded\\". 4\\\\. Temporary affinity groups instead of permanent organizations: This means rejection of \\"thus we are against the party, syndicate and permanent organization, all of which act to synthesize struggle and become elements of integration for capital and the state.\\" Instead the view that \\"organization is for concrete tasks\\". \\"The informal anarchist organization is therefore a specific organization which gathers around a common affinity.\\" 5\\\\. The transcendence of the dichotomy between the individual and the rest of society and of individualism and communism: \\"Insurrection begins with the desire of individuals to break out of constrained and controlled circumstances, the desire to reappropriate the capacity to create one's own life as one sees fit.\\" But the view that \\"Individuality can only flourish where equality of access to the conditions of existence is the social reality. This equality of access is communism; what individuals do with that access is up to them and those around them. Thus there is no equality or identity of individuals implied in true communism.\\" Insurrectionary anarchists often identify with differing theoretical positions within the anarchist spectrum.

L. R. James.Barberis, Peter; McHugh, John; Tyldesley, Mike. Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century. A & C Black, 2000, p160 In August 1938, James P. Cannon and Max Shachtman came to London in an attempt to unite all four British Trotskyist groups. The RSL, the Militant Group, and the Revolutionary Socialist Party merged to form a new Revolutionary Socialist League, but the Workers International League (WIL) refused, claiming that agreement on perspectives was insufficient and that the new group represented a dilution of democratic centralism. The new RSL became the British affiliate of the newly formed Fourth International. It maintained the Militant Labour League for those members who were involved in Labour Party entryism, and published The Militant. The group adopted a defeatist policy during the Second World War, which it modelled on Lenin's revolutionary defeatist tactics of the 1914‚Äì1918 war. This was seen by its rivals in the WIL as pacifism. However, it had some initial successes when the Shop Assistants' Union adopted its position in 1940. This led the Labour Party to ban the Militant Labour League. In addition, the group became increasingly inactive as many younger members were conscripted into the British Army. The group's opposition to the war became a major cause of factional strife both within the group and between it and the WIL. Three major positions developed, with ensuing factional divisions. Firstly, a Left Fraction formed, which opposed the war on a basis all other factions described as pacifist. Secondly, the leadership faction around Denzil Dean Harber held a position that opposed the Proletarian Military Policy (PMP) of the WIL and was described by its opponents as semi-pacifist. Third, the WIL and tendencies leaving the RSL at different times adhered to the aforementioned PMP. In 1939, some RSL members split to form the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL), which Isaac Deutscher soon joined, due to the inaction of the RSL leadership when the war began. Initially, they used the RSL name and only changed the name later. However, the majority of the RWL joined the WIL in 1940, with the remainder returning to the RSL in 1941. Another split produced the Socialist Workers Group which published Socialist Fight and entered the Independent Labour Party, some of its former members eventually joining the Trotskyist Opposition which had been expelled from the RSL in 1942. This group, led by John Lawrence, advocated adoption of the PMP of the Socialist Workers Party and was in favour of fusing with the WIL. Collaboration between the Trotskyist Opposition and the WIL was so close that Lawrence was employed by the latter on technical tasks. In 1943, the Left Fraction who were opposed to that policy were expelled. The leadership of the Revolutionary Socialist League refused to enter into any unity negotiations, despite the party's drastic reduction from 300 to 20 members, until in 1944 the Fourth International held a two-day conference. This conference was required to reunite the group so that it could fuse with the WIL into a single organization which could then affiliate to the Fourth International. As planned on the first day, the Trotskyist Opposition and the Left Fraction were reunited with the RSL. Despite the objections of the Left Fraction, the second day saw the reformed RSL unified with the WIL ‚Äì on the WIL's terms ‚Äì to form the new Revolutionary Communist Party.

Collapse of the RSL and founding of the RCP The party was founded as the official section of the Fourth International in Britain after the Revolutionary Socialist League collapsed. Moreover, the RSL had not adopted the positions of the Fourth International with regard to the Second World War and was polemicising against the Workers International League (WIL), declaring it to be following politics which it characterised as social patriotic. The positions of the WIL corresponded to those of the Fourth International and the American SWP and as a result the latter decided that the WIL should become the International's British section. In order to draw the WIL into the International, the Americans exerted pressure on the three factions of the RSL to re-unite, after which the re-formed RSL could fuse with the larger WIL. The fused group, which adopted the politics of the majority WIL group, became the Revolutionary Communist Party. The leadership bodies of the new party incorporated leaders of the RSL such as Denzil Dean Harber and John Lawrence, with the exception of the old RSL Left Fraction who soon left. Recruiting methods The new party maintained an entrist faction in the Labour Party. This faction was led by Charlie van Gelderen and maintained publication of The Militant as its organ. The main area on which the party concentrated however was the industrial front. This led to recruitment from the Communist Party but more recruits came from direct intervention in the industrial struggles of the war years such as that of the Kent miners and the Tyneside engineering apprentices. This latter dispute led to the RCP receiving the attention of the police as their headquarters in London were raided and a number of leading members were jailed. In furtherance of this industrial work a Militant Workers Federation was organised by the RCP in conjunction with the Industrial Committee of the Independent Labour Party and some anarchists. During the war the RCP opposed the electoral truce which guaranteed that where parliamentary seats fell vacant they would automatically be filled by another member of the incumbent party. When an opportunity for the RCP to stand occurred, the party stood their leader, Jock Haston, in the Neath by-election of 1945. The Left Faction of the former RSL remained organised within the RCP but were expelled in 1945 and pursued entrist work in the Labour Party work around the Voice of Labour newspaper. It broke up in 1950, when most of its members joined the Socialist Fellowship group which was associated with the paper Socialist Outlook. Other former Left Fraction members revived the group in the early 1960s. End In 1947, the party split over the question of entrism into the Labour Party. Jock Haston and Ted Grant opposed it; Gerry Healy and John Lawrence formed a faction in favour of it. With the agreement of both groups, the International Secretariat divided the British section and the minority pursued the entry tactic and published the newspaper Socialist Outlook from 1948. The remaining RCP found existence outside the Labour Party increasingly difficult with the end of wartime militancy. The RCP's membership and influence started to decline. The new regimes in Eastern Europe caused further debate within the RCP, as they did within the International as a whole. The leadership of the RCP around Haston was more cautious with regard to declaring these new regimes to be degenerated workers states than the International's leadership around Ernest Mandel and Michel Pablo. A debate developed as to whether the RCP should enter the Labour Party. The majority supported entry. A faction was declared by some supporters of the leadership, which firmly opposed entry. This grouping of RCPers called itself the Open Party Faction and was increasingly disillusioned with the leadership around Jock Haston and Ted Grant whom they thought to be caving in to Healy's entry group, ultimately leading to a decision to dissolve the RCP in 1950 and join the Labour Party. The International then ordered that the members of the RCP join Healy's entry group, known as The Club, but that despite being in a majority they were not able to exercise democratic control of the fused group. Jock Haston immediately dropped out of politics as did much of the remaining leadership. Ted Grant made a decision to join the fused group but was purged by Healy who strongly discouraged dissent. Some of Tony Cliff's supporters in Birmingham were expelled ‚Äì Cliff himself could not be expelled being resident in Dublin and therefore beyond Healy's reach ‚Äì and then when Grant attempted to defend the rights of Cliff's supporters he too was expelled. Cliff would regroup his supporters around the magazine Socialist Review and Grant similarly formed a group called the International Socialist Group. Most former members of the RCP had left the Trotskyist movement by the end of 1951.

This area is already growing as Nigeria‚Äôs technology hub and cluster of hundreds of banking institutions, educational institutions, technology and startup companies which steadily attracts angel investors, venture capitalists, enthusiasts and media people from all over the world. This cluster is the major reason many technology firms are considering opening up shops in Yaba. Close to the region is the Lagos Lagoon which lies on its south-western side, it empties into the Atlantic via Lagos Harbor, a main channel through the heart of the city, 0.5 km to 1 km wide and 10 km long. The term originally was born from an unintentional act of an absent mind, manipulating the Silicon Valley name to create a nick version for this cluster while writing a story title. from thebusinessaim.com.ng More so, due to the lagoon near this region, the term Silicon lagoon has also been used to refer to this cluster although this is yet to stick and its origin or creator is unknown. Regardless of the tech clusters in Africa, Yabacon Valley (YV) or Silicon lagoon ‚Äî whichever name you chose to call it ‚Äî continues to be a leading hub for high-tech innovation and development, buoyed by the country‚Äôs budding, technology-savvy middle-class and massive online population of 126 million internet users. Nigeria‚Äôs fledgling technology start-up scene is witnessing a flurry of activities in the frame of new investment drive, acquisitions, strategic partnerships as well as plans to establish more incubation centers. Geographically, Yabacon Valley encompasses all Yaba Local Council Development area which was carved out of the old Lagos Mainland Local Government created in 1977 as a separate local government following the national reform of Local government in September 1976. The Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city council which administered the Lagos Metropolitan city consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former Lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it. The present Yaba Local Council Area has the look of an urban setting; some areas however mirror rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yabacon Valley is a development, a commercial nerve center for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations. Origin of term It is not known if the term Yabacon Valley has been mentioned or used in reference of this tech cluster in the past, but its first published use is credited to The Business Aim, an online publishing platform with focus on business, strategy, innovation, startup culture and everything new. According to Google search results, the name was first used by Blaise Aboh, then an award-winning editor, now Data Analysis/Design Lead and Founding Partner at Orodata Science Nigeria a Civic technology organization as part of a title for an article on reasons for the arrival of startup accelerators, and also to announce the emergence of a new player named Passion Incubator in Yaba technology ecosystem. The article is dated 13 March 2014. The term is still not widely known however it is been used in conversations among the geeks, players and enthusiasts in the tech ecosystem especially on technology focused blogs and social media. There's still controversy surrounding the name, arguments and comments made on article a popular Nigerian technology blog Techcabal confirms this as few are disgruntled and think a better nickname can be created. They feel the name ought to be something else without the ‚Äòcon‚Äô and the ‚Äòvalley‚Äô arguing why Nigeria must mimic the west in almost everything. But there are many who actually like the name. Weekly in conversations, this name pops up and there are those who are of the opinion that if the name is disliked so much, it should not be brought up regularly. from techcabal.com Late 2015, a tech blog's community post declared Yabacon Valley is dead. Long live Yaba Right'. The conversation was about how the name Yabacon Valley was not a good branding of the tech cluster, and why other suggestions like 'Yaba Right' or 'Yaba District' or even 'Silicon Yaba' were more suitable names. The Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative (PIN) a social enterprise, 'Gbenga Sesan in a comment said that 'If something wasn't broken, why fix it'? That the whole thing was but a fruitless argument. He was of the opinion that when the time was right, the right name would come, that 'instead of looking for a new name by all means, let all cities focus on real work without assumptions'. It must be noted that one person alone does not have the power to name a country, let alone a district. It comes from careful or careless deliberations, negotiation, discuss, or in the case of YV; incessant community debates and arguments over its origin, originality and suitability. Yabacon is a portmanteau of ‚ÄòYaba‚Äô the Lagos suburb and ‚ÄòSilicon‚Äô, a chemical element used to create most semiconductors commercially for electronic computers. Although there are technology companies in this area, there are no companies involved in the making of semiconductors since the cluster is still at its green stage and Nigeria is yet to advance to the technology level of manufacturing electronics. Thus, the name is just a sheer but unconscious imitation of America's Silicon valley. The name Yabacon Valley (YV) is alive although proclaimed dead because the Yaba technology community made it a continuous topic of discussion on blogs, social media and community posts. The name was an ordinary creation of a creative writer while penning the title of an article. The tech community made it the monster it is today. Demographics The population of Yabacon Valley is between 200 and 300 thousand approximately. It is assumed that females outnumber males in the majority of the localities in Yabacon Valley due to concentration of tertiary institutions in the area. Boundaries North of this area is Shiro Street down to other side of Morocco road towards the roundabout. This also includes Abule- Ijesha South - Muritala Muhammed way from Jibowu to Wright street junction. To the East is the Lagos lagoon, Onike, Onitiri, Makoko, Iwaya, University of Lagos communities also overlooking lagoon. To the West; a descent of 3rd mainland bridge to Wright Street to Murtala Muhammed way to include Total services station at that junction. History Yaba is a part of Lagos Nigeria with many small towns and communities such as Onyigbo, Ebute metta, Makoko, Sabo, Akoka, Abule Ijesha, Onike, Jibowu, and Iwaya among others. Yaba Local council development area as it is today has its secretariat at 198, Herbert Macaulay Street, carved out of the old Lagos Mainland local government which was created in 1977 as a separate Local government following the national reform of Local government in September 1976. Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city council which administered the Lagos Metropolitan city; this consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it. Yaba Local council Development area as one of the Thirty Seven (37) newly created Local council Development areas was created out of Lagos Mainland by the administration of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu after the state assembly passed a law creating new local council Development areas. The present Yaba local council area wears an urban setting; some part however mirrored rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yaba Local council development area is the commercial nerve centre for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations. \\"Perhaps the strongest push responsible for this industrial powerhouse and cluster is the increase in demand of products leveraging technology for growth\\". = Presence of leading institutions of higher learning = Yabacon valley has two of Nigeria‚Äôs leading educational institutions in Yaba College of Technology (Yabatech) and University of Lagos. Both higher institutions are known to be of higher learning standards and have some of the country‚Äôs best brains as lecturers. There of course are the less seasoned institutions which are prestigious in their own right ‚Äì the Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka (a teacher training institute) and Queens‚Äô college one of Africa‚Äôs best post primary educational institutions. Historical significance, landmarks and memorials. Yaba also has notable landmarks like the statue of Herbert Macaulay the father of nationalism in Nigeria. Many other landmarks such as Tejuosho Market, E-center, National library of Nigeria, Yabatech among other notable landmarks there are also historically significant landmarks, such as the tallest building on the mainland Corner stone house, the first filling station in Nigeria - (Total at Sabo) and many more. = An expanding middle class = Yaba has one of the fastest expanding middle class groups in Nigeria as a whole. This is why developers fall over themselves to renovate old buildings or expand them out rightly to create apartments for working class folks. Real estate boom is in no small way an issue to consider when middle-class families demand for accommodation. =Reduced crime rate= Crime rate in most parts of yaba is low. Perhaps the heavy presence of security details around the place deters criminals or could be that the ever busy nature of the place seems to inconvenience criminals. Also there is the possibility that many so called criminals may consider productive work readily available for idle hands to be more rewarding. =Nearness to the island= Lagos island is the nerve center of commerce and the service based industry in Nigeria as a whole. Living in Yaba keeps you close to the Victoria island, Ikoyi and Lekki and thereby reduces Yaba residents' transportation expenses and stress due to heavy traffic jams relative to the aforementioned areas. =Rapid economic expansion= The local economy in this part of Lagos is rapidly expanding. Eateries, banks, hotels, retail stores, insurance companies, night clubs are booming implying a lot of opportunities both for investors and employment seekers. The expansion of this area is rapid and many companies are setting up so as to not miss out of its financial benefits. =The emergence of Yaba as a startup cluster= In 2011, Wennovation Hub in partnership with African Leadership Forum started incubating startups in the tech ecosystem but not much noise was made till 2012 when Bosun Tijani a social innovator & entrepreneur and a group of individuals set out to help animate a community of change agents who believe in building a strong base for Nigeria through technology. They were certain they could help accelerate a movement of people who are driven by the need to disrupt the status quo in Nigeria through smart application of technology. The name was later changed to Cc-HUB, and it became Nigeria‚Äôs first startup incubator. With investment and support in cash and kind from organisations such as the Indigo Trust, Omidyar Network, MainOne Cable Company and the Lagos State government, it soon gained momentum and proceeded to install a fibre-optic-powered information superhighway. In 2011, former banker Seun Onigbinde co-founded BudgIT, a fiscal transparency project, on the third floor of CC Hub‚Äôs six-storey building in Yaba. As one of the first early-stage startups to benefit from CC Hub‚Äôs incubation drive in 2011, it received $5,000 of its $90,000 seed funding from billionaire businessman Tony Elumelu. Big names like Konga, eCommerce company valued at approximately $200 million as after raising $20 million in Series C rounds, arrived in 2013, while Africa Internet Group which has $469 million in 4 Rounds from six investors transferred six of its companies to Yaba in 2014. In same 2014 BudgIT received $400,000 grant from Omidyar. Mid 2016, Andela ‚Äì a Nigerian- founded talent accelerator for programmers that has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi and New York ‚Äì received $24 million in investment from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In 2015 Hotels.ng, which claims to be the largest hotel booking site in Nigeria secured $1.2 million in funding from Omidyar Network to expand its listings across Africa. A number of startups including Iroko ‚Äì the biggest digital retailer of Nollywood worldwide with total funding of $40 million ‚Äì and Paystack, an alternative e-payments company which raised $1.3 million investment in December 2016 from international investors Tencent, Comcast Ventures and more, have offices outside the cluster but still intermingle with those from Yabacon Valley. =The coming of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder= In August 2016, Mark Zuckerberg visited Nigeria, and specifically Yaba. A day after Zuckerberg's visit to Yaba, local and international media went agog as to why Yaba is 'Nigeria's Silicon Valley' after all. In Zuckerberg‚Äôs first visit to Africa, his first stop was at Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) in Yaba, Lagos, ground zero for start-ups in order to listen, learn and take ideas back to California on how Facebook can better support tech development and entrepreneurship across Africa. In a Facebook post he said; \\"the energy here is amazing and I‚Äôm excited to learn as much as I can, I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting more people in Nigeria\\" after he met and interacted with kids at a summer coding camp in CCHub, developers and entrepreneurs in the startup ecosystem in Nigeria. He then went to Andela where the Chan Zuckerberg foundation had made an investment months back. The visit was part of a series of global town hall meetings.

He wrote the PadƒÅrtha-dharma-sa·πÖgraha (Collection of Properties of Matter) and a commentary, titled Pra≈õastapƒÅda BhƒÅ·π£ya , on the Vaisheshika Sutras of Kanada (Circa 6th Century BCE), both texts are comprehensive books in physics. In these texts Prashastapada discusses the properties of motion. Ganganath Jha had translated Pra≈õastapƒÅda BhƒÅ·π£ya which translation was published in 1916. Prashasta or Pra≈õasta (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡§∏‡•ç‡§§) means praised or praiseworthy, lauded or laudable, commended or commendable or eulogized. Dayananda Saraswati writes that the Sutras of KanƒÅda and PadƒÅrthadharmasa·πÖgraha of Pra≈õastapƒÅda do not show much influence of the Nyaya System. Pra≈õastapƒÅda BhƒÅ·π£ya is actually not a commentary but an independent compendium of the tenets of the Vaisheshika School. Udayanacharya of the Navya-NyƒÅya School, the author of Lak·π£a·πáƒÅvalƒ´ which gives the definitions of Vai≈õe·π£ika terms, and NyƒÅya Kusumanjali which is a systematic account of Nyaya Theism, who also belonged to Mithila, had written Kiranavali which is a commentary on Pra≈õastapƒÅda BhƒÅ·π£ya . Pra≈õastapƒÅda can be tentatively dated to the second half of the 6th century C.E.Potter, Karl H., ed. The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2: Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology: The Tradition of Nyaya-Vaisesika up to Gangesa. Vol. 2. Princeton University Press, 2015. P. 282. The Vai≈õe·π£ika philosophy recognizes twenty-four gunas or qualities that are inherent in substances; these include seventeen gunas listed by Kanada and seven gunas ‚Äì gurutva (heaviness), dravatva (fluidity), sneha (viscidity), dharma (merit), adharma (demerit), shabda (sound) and samskara (faculty) - added by Pra≈õastapƒÅda. Vyomavati of Vyoma≈õekhara, Nyayakandali of Shridhara, Kiranavali of Udayana and Lilavati of ≈örƒ´vatsa are well known commentaries on his works. Pra≈õastapƒÅda refers to a type of perception that is the simple intuition ( alochana ) of the proper form ( svarupa ) of an entity, which is the apprehension of an undifferentiated ( avibhktam ) whole arising from cognition of its specific universals. This is the preliminary stage. He differs from DignƒÅga for whom the determinates of cognitions are subjective constructs imposed upon the given, and constructive cognition is not a perception; Pra≈õastapƒÅda, who was a realist, avers that the determinates are objective constituents of reality and their conceptual co-relates are not inter- subjective fictions. Pra≈õastapƒÅda by redefining substance as per se a possessor of attributes opened new turf by separating the cosmological from the logical dimensions of concepts. His commentary overshadowed the Vaisheshika Sutras and became the main vehicle for later commentaries. Pra≈õastapƒÅda describes the dissolution of the earth, water, air and fire in terms of their atomic constituents but excludes space because space is non- atomic. With regard to the conjoining and disjoining of atoms he includes a higher will or order as the guiding principle of universal dissolution which over-rides the natural karma of atoms. Ka·πáƒÅda does not directly refer to Ishvara (God) but Pra≈õastapƒÅda sees Ishvara as the cause of the universe but does not explain how God creates.

Formation After the dissolution of the Revolutionary Communist Party, Ted Grant and his supporters were expelled from the RCP's successor The Club in 1950 and formed the International Socialist Group. They went on to fuse with supporters of the International Secretariat of the Fourth International in Britain as the Revolutionary Socialist League in 1956 and were recognised as the official British section at its fifth world congress in 1957. The RSL held its first congress in 1957.Aitman, T. (1991) A comment on some aspects of entrism It was an entryist group within the Labour Party that published Socialist Fight. In 1958 the group was recognised as the British section of the International Secretariat of the Fourth International and, after the reunification in 1963, the British section of the Fourth International. However, the League registered substantial political differences at the 1965 World Congress, and failed to integrate other supporters of the International in Britain. The Congress recognised two sympathising sections in Britain: the RSL and what became the International Marxist Group, prompting the RSL to turn its back on the International. In 1964, the RSL founded the newspaper Militant and the group itself soon became known by this name, although the official name was still used internally.

Being active both on emergency projects as well as longer term development projects, it aims to provide support to the most in- need populations in Lebanon (locals or foreigners), through its 24 centers and 6 mobile clinics in the most disadvantaged areas of Lebanon (South Beirut suburbs, Bekaa region and South-Lebanon). In 2010, the Association established Amel Association International and opened representation in Geneva. Since 2010, Amel has had a consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and has been a member of the Collective of Lebanese NGOs, the Collective of Arab NGO,s the ICVA, the Global Coalition for Social Protection, and many other networks. History Lebanese Civil War and creation of the association Amel was born in 1979 in reaction to the second Israeli invasion of South Lebanon (Operation Litani) which led to several massacres, much displacement and destruction of Lebanese infrastructure. In this context, Dr. Kamel Mohanna, a doctor from Khiam (South Lebanon) created Amel Association with the help of a group of professors, journalists and intellectuals Hence, through its 27 centers and dispensaries, its 3 rural hospitals, its important civil defense team and its 30 ambulances, Amel engaged in emergency and assistance actions targeting the victim populations. Peace settlement and development of the association In 1989, the Taef Agreements put an end to 15 years of civil war and marked the beginning of a progressive return to peace in the country. After 10 years of emergency relief and assistance to people wounded in war, Amel decided to move from an emergency approach to a longer-term development approach, embodied by an interim restructuring (election of a new board committee and reorganization of centers and tasks). 2012-2014: Syrian crisis and emergency response In April 2012, a wide and comprehensive program named \\"Syrian Refugee Emergency Response\\" was implemented in order to guarantee decent conditions of living to all the populations affected by the conflict (to both refugees populations and host populations (by providing them for example primary healthcare, food and clothes distribution). Vision and actions Vision and principles Amel Association is committed to a universal and international vision of human rights, a vision of moving towards building a common future with the spirit of human solidarity that seeks to serve the just causes of the world. One of the main objectives of Amel Association is to endorse the sense of belonging and citizenship in the Lebanese and Arab communities, a belonging that maintains the civil rights of each citizen that protect him from all forms of discrimination based on color, religion, or political affiliations. At this point, the aim of spreading the culture of rights is to make people more aware and conscious of their fundamental rights, especially children, women and people with special needs, to be able to defend them, which will foster the building of a citizenship of equivalent rights and duties. Amel in Action =Health Program= Amel organizes several campaigns of free vaccination, distribution of medicines and medical consultations in order to ensure general and systematic access to primary health care for everyone, in collaboration with local institutions and schools. =Education, Child protection and Psychosocial support to families= The education projects implemented by Amel seek to reinforce the equal rights of education for every children. They mainly consist of remedial summer courses for out-of-school children or for those in an accelerated learning program (ALP). The Association also provided psycho-social support and assistance for the most impoverished families through the production and diffusion of educative material, the implementation of kinder gardens, day care centers and prevention sessions on several themes (child labor, domestic violence, teenager psychology, etc.). Those initiatives are completed through recreation activities aiming to promote the values of friendship, respect and tolerance among children, as well as nurturing their creativity and their self-perception of their rights. =Vocational Training and Human Capacity Development= Improving individual personal abilities, in particular those of women and youth, is an important part of Amel strategy. On that matter, Amel has set up vocational and educational training programs in several centers since 1990. =Protection of Migrant Domestic Workers= This program is set to raise awareness on their rights and to clarify the responsibilities and duties of employers over their employees in order to prevent abuses. Examples of activities: English lessons, awareness sessions, psychological support and capacity development workshops. Since March 2012, Amel has been part of a consortium of NGOs to reinforce coordination and assistance to this population. =Rural Development= An agricultural cooperative project was started in April 2004 in Ebl el-Saqi thanks to a collaboration with European Commission and the Italian NGO \\"Africa 70.\\" This cooperative is dedicated to the production of organic soap from essential oils and medicinal plants. Anchorage in Lebanese civil society, and main partners Cooperation and coordination with other actors has always been a core principle of the association.

On September 23rd of the same year, Rosario municipality adopted Decree No. 24478 where the intersection of the streets Arist√≥bulo del Valle and Pueyrred√≥n in Barrio Pichincha were named after Rodolfo Cholo Montironi. The following year he appeared, to great acclaim, on Ariston Milan, along with (among others) pianist Barbara Varassi (Rosario) and Alfonso Pac√≠n who played violin and also doubled on guitar. In 2005, he returned to the recording studio where he conducted the backing group for the singer Germ√°n Becker (1980 ‚Äì ). During the following years, he continued to visit different countries with his bandoneon while he intensified his teaching. In July 2006, he recorded the album Paris Rosario, accompanied by Alfonso Pac√≠n on guitar in the studio Lo Pac√≠n en Romainville (Par√≠s). They performed works by Carlos Gardel, Piazzolla, Lennon-McCartney, Charles Aznavour. In 2010, the Musimedios Foundation and the Ministry of Culture in Rosario edited this album. These tracks were cut from the album recorded in Lo Pacin studio Romain, Paris, July 2006. Montironi has written numerous arrangements for a wide range of performers, from solo bandoneon to large orchestral scores. He has arranged a large number of tango pieces for the Norwegian bandoneonist K√•re Jostein Simonsen who has visited \\"Cholo\\" repeatedly over the last ten years. Among these works are the trio pieces for Simonsen‚Äôs Master's Degree concert for performing bandoneon at the NTNU Trondheim Conservatory of Music in 2013. During an interview in 2010, he stated that he has made sixty-four trips to Europe and nine to the United States, he has also performed in Algeria, China and Japan. On August 24, 2012, the Argentine House of Representatives honored Montironi as a ¬´Famous ambassador of Argentina¬ª in the main hall of Parliament (Buenos Aires). Montironi continues to be active in various venues in Rosario with his trio, with Javier Mart√≠nez Lo Re (piano) and Ruben Mill (bass), and alternated between Rodolfo Demar, Gaby Estrada and Leonel Capitano (vocals), and has used Ernesto Renzi as reciter. Personal orchestras =Discepol√≠n= In the middle of 1964, he formed his own orchestra Montironi Discepol√≠n. The members of the orchestra were Rodolfo Montironi (bandoneon), Ra√∫l Oca√±a (piano), Carlos Padula (guitar), David Elia (violin), Domingo Fiore (bass), Roberto Dumas and Oscar Ju√°rez (vocals). In the following years he alternated the singers with √Ångel Barrios and Ra√∫l Encina. In 1968, the Polish singer Roberto Goyeneche traveled regularly to Rosario and collaborated with Cholo. Together they toured the northern part of the province of Santa Fe, Chaco and Corrientes. He also shared the stage with other great performers within the genre such as Floreal Ruiz, Miguel Montero and Jos√© Libertella. =Montironi trio= In 1969 he formed a trio with Francisco Tejedor (piano) and Joseph Rios (bass). The trio often performed with singers such as; Jorge Valdez, Mario Bustos. Together with the singer Carlos Budini, Montironi formed a duo for a cabaret in Morocco, where they shared the stage with Rita Salvaje. Besides this, he worked with Ra√∫l Lavi and his wife Lidia Elsa Satragno (Pinky) in a performance of music and poetry. The plot of the performance took place in Rosario and other cities in the province of Santa Fe, such as Rafaela and Corral de Bustos. He recorded an album with his band and singer Luis Correa to lyrics from their own tango poet Francisco Sappietro.

Shakespeare and Ellis were described as \\"best friends\\" and \\"innocent victims\\". Charlene's twin sister Sophie, cousin Cheryl Shaw and a friend, Leon Harris, were also injured. Shaw was shot in the hand. The shooting, investigated by the West Midlands Police under its new Chief Constable, Paul Scott-Lee, was part of a feud between two Birmingham gangs, the \\"Johnson Crew\\" and the \\"Burger Bar Boys\\", and was in response to the murder of Yohanne Martin, a Burger Bar Boys associate. Four men were each convicted of murder and attempted murder at Leicester Crown Court in March 2005. Marcus Ellis, 24 (Charlene's half-brother), Michael Gregory, 22, and Nathan Martin, 26 (brother of Yohanne), were jailed for a minimum of 35 years. Rodrigo Simms, 20, was sentenced to 27 years ‚Äì the lesser figure being due to his age at the time of the shooting. The trial was the first in England at which witnesses were allowed to remain anonymous. In 2005, the convicted men appealed at Woolwich Crown Court but the appeal was turned down. They were also refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In 2012, Ellis, Martin and Simms appealed to the European Court of Human Rights that they had not received a fair trial. This appeal was also dismissed. The mothers of the two dead women, Marcia Shakespeare and Beverley Thomas, have since actively campaigned against gun crime and gangs. They set up the 'Letisha and Charlene Education Awards', administered by the Birmingham & Black Country Community Foundation, a registered charity, in 2006. In December 2016 it was announced that Marcia Shakespeare had been appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours.

It is now in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan, Italy. An oil painting on canvas, it measures by . In a conscious revival of the convention in classical sculpture of showing important political figures in heroic nudity, it depicts the Genoan admiral, Andrea Doria, posing as the classical god of the sea, Neptune.G√°ldy, 60-64 Description The subject of the painting is Andrea Doria, a Renaissance condottiero and admiral from Genoa, who was also the effective ruler of the city-state. He was around 60 or 80 years old when the portrait was painted (the date is somewhat disputed); either way his physique hardly reflects his age at the time.G√°ldy, 64 He chose to be depicted nude as the \\"God of the Sea\\". Although Doria is depicted naked, he is not fragile or frail. He is depicted as a powerful virile man, showing masculine spirit, strength, vigor, and power. He is stern and resolute, looking calmly over all that he surveys, yet also refined and mannered. The picture was meant to symbolize Doria's power, success, and fame as a celebrated admiral of his time. His beard is lengthy, flowing like the waves on the sea, and tufts of hair on his head recall the Roman emperors. Although his body is aged, his skin is still supple. He originally held a squared oar, a symbol of his command over his own fleet, but a trident head ‚Äì described by art critic Camille Paglia as \\"cartoonish\\" ‚Äì was painted over it by an unknown artist. The outline of the original oar is still faintly visible. The same individual probably added Doria's name. Doria is holding a piece of sailcloth which barely covers his genitals and exposes some of his pubic hair. Paglia asserts that his taut, yet somewhat portly, stomach appears to direct its strength into Doria's covered penis. She finds the innuendo of an erection in the stiff wood of the trident and mast. Jonathan Jones of The Guardian describes the painting as \\"consciously equat[ing] naval and sexual prowess\\". Doria stands on the deck of his ship, as Neptune would upon his chariot. Behind him is a black, \\"oppressive\\" sky, but he is highlighted as if by a full moon or the lightning of an approaching storm. He stands in a strained manner, his head facing to the right but his thighs and buttocks remaining in profile. Through the allegory to Neptune, Doria ‚Äì \\"a conqueror of the forces of Nature\\" through his work ‚Äì is connected to the mythological powers. He becomes Neptune, ruler of the oceans. Doria Andrea Doria was born into an aristocratic family who had been wealthy political leaders of the Genoan republic since 1134, together with another influential family, the Spinola. He was orphaned at an early age. Aged about sixty when this portrait was completed, Doria was famous as a naval commander. For several years, he scoured the Mediterranean in command of the Genoese fleet, waging war on the Turks and the Barbary pirates. Although he was wealthy himself, Doria entered the service of King Francis I of France, who made him captain-general. On the expiration of his contract with Francis in 1528, Doria entered the service of Emperor Charles V. As imperial admiral, he commanded several expeditions against the Turks. He was generally successful and perpetually active in military assignments from a very early age until he was over eighty, and he was especially successful at sea. Through his military successes he gained power, wealth, weapons, equipment and land, taking war booty from his enemies; this was the general method by which the Genoese nobles gained power and influence. In 1528, Doria's fleet won a victory over the French and drove them from Genoa; Doria became the new ruler. Even at the age of 84, he was leading military operations against the pirates in the waters of Genoa. Creation and provenance Bronzino's so-called \\"allegorical portraits\\", such as this Genoese admiral, are not representative of his art, or of contemporary portrait painting in general, but are possibly more captivating due to the eccentricity of depicting a publicly recognized personality as a nude mythical figure.Maurice Brock, Bronzino (Paris: Flammarion; London: Thames & Hudson, 2002).Deborah, Parker, Bronzino: Renaissance Painter as Poet (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000). In painting Doria, he may have been inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's 1503 sketch of Poseidon and his horses. The painting was commissioned for Paolo Giovio, bishop and retired papal physician, who lived near Como, and was perhaps completed around 1530. Giovo developed a \\"Museum of Famous Men\\" of commissioned portraits.G√°ldy, 64 Contemporary prints of the work provide documentary evidence for how it originally looked. There is a second version in the Villa Doria in Genoa, where Doria holds an oar rather than a trident; this seems to have been the original intention in the Milan painting.G√°ldy, 64 See also *Statue of Neptune, Valletta References *G√°ldy, Andrea M, Agnolo Bronzino: Medici Court Artist in Context, 2014, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, , 9781443866354 Doria, Andrea as Neptune Doria, Andrea as Neptune Category:1530 paintings Doria, Andrea as Neptune Doria, Andrea as Neptune Doria, Andrea as Neptune Category:Paintings of Pinacoteca di Brera Category:Neptune (mythology) ","title":"Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune"},{"id":"43357010","text":"Yusra Medical & Dental College () (YM&DC;) is a private medical college located in Islamabad.

Additionally they could levy revenues from inns and tithe in ≈Ωukov, Tƒõrlicko, Ostrava and Lacbanty, and in the late 13th century they also had rights to revenues from three villages in the Castellany of Racib√≥rz: Gorzyce, Uchylsko and Go≈Çkowice.I.

As the first abbot served father Jan from Tyniec. He was accompanied by a few to no more than a score of brothers. They had started building a new church and a monastery. In the beginnings of 15th century they suffered through a financial crisis. To survive they sold a part of their belongings. In 1540s the Reformation began in the Duchy of Teschen. In 1545 Wac≈Çaw III Adam secularised belongings of the abbey, which sparkled a conflict with Orlov√°'s abbot, which ended in 1560 when the remaining belongings were also confiscated by the duke. The buildings of the monastery were demolished, apart from the church. The monks never managed to regain what they lost afterwards.

History  In 1850, a branch was opened from the Bad Kleinen‚ÄìRostock railway in B√ºtzow to G√ºstrow. In the following years the network was further expanded, including a connection from G√ºstrow to Neubrandenburg opened in 1864, which was extended to Stettin (now Szczecin in Poland) in 1867. The line from Gustrow to Plau was opened in 1882. What was still missing was a direct connection between Rostock and G√ºstrow, the largest and the fourth largest towns in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg- Schwerin. The Neustrelitz‚ÄìWarnem√ºnde railway (Lloyd Railway) was put into operation in 1886, connecting Rostock with Neustrelitz and Berlin, but bypassing G√ºstrow. A year later, two lines between Rostock and G√ºstrow emerged almost simultaneously. On the one hand, the Priemerburg‚ÄìPlaaz railway was built by the G√ºstrow Plau Railway (), which provided a connection to Rostock via the Lloyd Railway. On the other hand, a state line was built by the Grand Duchy to Schwaan on the Bad Kleinen‚ÄìRostock railway. Originally the line was controlled from Schwiesow and Rukieten on the existing main lines, but by the end of the 19th century the line was controlled from local signal boxes in the stations of G√ºstrow and Schwaan. Mistorf station (July 2008). To the left is the catenary on the dismantled second track. In addition to local traffic, the line was significant for long-distance traffic. From 1895, trains from Berlin to Rostock and Copenhagen ran via G√ºstrow instead of on the direct route via Plaaz on the Lloyd Railway. After the Second World War, the Lloyd Railway south of Plaaz was dismantled as reparations to the Soviet Union. As a result, after the reconstruction in 1948 of the Schwaan‚ÄìRostock line, which had also been dismantled for reparations, the G√ºstrow‚ÄìSchwaan line became an important route for passenger and freight traffic. The traffic between Berlin and Rostock ran via Neubrandenburg and G√ºstrow. The route via Karow served as an alternate route. G√ºstrow station was rebuilt from 1952 to 1954 because of the increased freight traffic. The first relay interlocking of the Reichsbahndirektion (railway division) of Schwerin went into operation there in 1954. Even after the reconstruction of the Lloyd Railway in 1960, the route was particularly important for long-distance services between Rostock and Berlin with more than half of the Durchgangszug (express) trains continued to run via G√ºstrow. The line was electrified in May 1985. Since 1998, local trains running between Rostock and G√ºstrow have been included in the Rostock S-Bahn network. In subsequent years, the line speed was raised to 120 km/h and the last crossing opportunity located in former Mistorf station was removed. = Current situation = The line is served hourly (every two hours on weekends) by line S2 of the Rostock S-Bahn (Warnem√ºnde‚ÄìRostock Hauptbahnhof‚ÄìG√ºstrow). Every two hours, a Regional-Express (RE5) runs on the Rostock‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìLutherstadt Wittenberg route; once a day this time slot is operated as the InterConnex service on the Warnem√ºnde‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìLeipzig route.

He was director of the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology until 2010 and head of the institute department until 2013. Since 2014 he serves as the chairman of an emeritus group at the institute. He has made substantial contributions to the field of brain research, in particular on the mechanisms of perception, behaviour and their adaptability. Within the framework of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Science Association he has exerted a lasting influence on the German community of researchers.  Life  Two neighboring Eigenmannia perform the Jamming avoidance response. When a fish with an electric discharge of 400 Hz encounters another fish with the same discharge frequency, one fish shifts its frequency upward and the other shifts its frequency downward. After finishing school at the Geschwister-Scholl- Gymnasium in D√ºsseldorf, Scheich studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Cologne (1961‚Äì63), at Munich (1963‚Äì64 and 1965‚Äì66) and Montpellier, France (1964‚Äì65). He concluded his medicine studies with the State examination at the University of Munich in 1966. From 1967 to 1969 Scheich worked as a PhD student on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) at the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry Munich in the department run by Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt. He completed his PhD degree with highest praise (summa cum laude) in 1969. While working on his PhD, he published a series of scientific works on the physiology of the visual system of cats. From 1969 to 1972 Scheich served as post-doctoral student under Theodore H. Bullock at the University of California in San Diego, USA. Here he participated in the research on the Jamming avoidance response, a characteristic of Behavioral communication among electric fish and on its neurophysiological foundations. From 1972 to 1974 Scheich led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G√∂ttingen, on the subject of acoustic communication. In 1974, Scheich accepted a professorship for zoology and neurobiology at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. Between 1977 and 1985 he undertook field research trips to the Amazon basin, central Africa and Thailand, where he studied electric fish and the Behavioral communication of birds, that led to the discovery of Ultrasonic hearing. Scheich was guest professor at the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and joint the Australian National University Canberra, for a research period, during which time he discovered the electric sensory organ of the platypus. After German reunification and the foundation of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Science Association in 1992, Scheich was appointed director and head of the department at the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology (IfN, since 2010 LIN) in Magdeburg, that included a professorship for physiology at the medical faculty of the Otto-von-Guericke University. The LIN, that has originated from an institute of the Scientific Academy of the GDR (East Germany), focuses on research into the mechanisms of learning and memory. The research program of Scheich at the LIN concentrated on the organisation of auditory and vocal behaviour in animals and humans and in this context on the role of the Auditory cortex during learning events. In 2003 Scheich participated in the establishment of the annual International Conference on Auditory Cortex event. Scheich‚Äôs tenure as the director of the LIN ended in 2010. During the same year he also retired from the Otto-von- Guericke University. From 2014 to 2018 Scheich has continued his work with his emeritus group. Scheich has missed no opportunity to publicly emphasize the significance of brain research for human education and was involved in organizations associated with research support, the self-administration of science and political counselling (e.g. the so-called ‚ÄòBlue List‚Äô Committee, the Evaluation Committee of the German Council of Science and Humanities, the Heisenberg Committee of the German Research Foundation, the Health Research Council of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research).

Kozal was noted for his intelligence and dedication to studies and studied to become a priest during World War I, which disrupted his studies but did not prevent his ordination in 1918; he gained fame for his abilities and rose to several positions that superiors endowed upon him all culminating in being named a Monsignor in 1932 and then appointed to the episcopate in 1939 just before World War II started. But his pastoral mission as a bishop did not last long since the Nazi forces arrested and tortured him and sent him to Dachau where he died after being injected with a lethal substance. His beatification was celebrated in Poland on 14 June 1987 after Pope John Paul II had made his apostolic visit to that nation. Life Kozal was born on 27 September 1893 in Congress Poland to the peasants Jan Kozal and Marianna P≈Çaczek. His father married in 1888 to his mother, who was widowed with five children at the time; Kozal had six siblings, including brother Wojciech, who participated in the Greater Poland Uprising and the Polish-Bolshevik War, in which he was killed at Grodno in 1920. Kozal commenced his education on 27 April 1905 at Krotoszyn and at one stage participated in a student strike to take action against the forced Germanization and the forced teaching of the German language. He passed his examinations in 1914 and was offered further studies but rejected the offer to instead pursue a path to the priesthood first in Poznan and then in Gniezno for theological and philosophical studies. Kozal was ordained to the priesthood in the Gniezno Cathedral in 1918. On 1 June 1920 he was appointed as the administrator of the Saint Nicholas parish until 1923 and around this time collaborated with the Catholic Action movement and the Polish Red Cross. Cardinal Edmund Dalbor ‚Äì in 1923 ‚Äì moved him to Bia≈Ço≈õliwiu as a parish priest and that April served as a catechist and teacher as well. Cardinal August Hlond ‚Äì on 1 November 1927 ‚Äì placed him in a leadership position at Gniezno in addition to serving as a theological and liturgical studies professor; he was appointed as the rector on 25 September 1929. In 1932 he became titled as a Monsignor after Cardinal Hlond sought papal approval for this. Pope Pius XII ‚Äì on 10 June 1939 ‚Äì appointed him as the Titular Bishop of Lappa and the Auxiliary Bishop of W≈Çoc≈Çawek, and he received his episcopal consecration as such the following 13 August in the W≈Çoc≈Çawek Cathedral. The outbreak of World War II saw him tend to the wounded victims and those who were displaced due to the war and the Polish invasion; he was expelled from his diocese when the Germans arrived on 14 September 1939, and one German warned him to leave lest he risk being killed. The Gestapo called him and a fellow priest forward in October 1939 and instructed them to preach in German, but both refused; both said German was not well understood among the people, so the Gestapo ordered sermons to be submitted for translation, but again the two refused to do this. The Gestapo arrested him and 44 other priests and seminarians on 7 November 1939, and he was tortured and jailed in his diocese; he was later moved to Lad before being sent to both Szczeglin and Berlin before the fatal transfer to Dachau, from which he would never again leave. He was locked in confinement where the guards tried to break his resolve when banging on the doors with the butts of their rifles. On 16 January 1940 he was relocated to a Cistercian convent turned camp for a brief imprisonment and suffered frostbite on his ears and nose during the cold in his transfer; he was there until 3 April 1941 when moved to Inowroc≈Çaw. It was there he was beaten upon arrival, and his first interrogation saw him suffer an inflamed ear due to the severe torture; he received the prisoner number 24544 on 25 April 1941. Kozal never shirked from his duties and spent his time in imprisonment ministering to fellow prisoners despite extensive abuse he received from the guards at the camp. Kozal suffered from typhoid, and his situation grew worse on 17 January 1943; on 26 January the Nazi doctor Joseph Sneiss gave him a lethal injection of phenol in his right arm, and his remains were cremated in the camp's crematorium on 30 January. His death was announced on Polish radio on 1 February. Kozal's paternal cousin Ceslao was also a prisoner and heard the words Sneiss said to the bishop before his murder: \\"Now the way to eternity will be easier\\". Beatification The beatification process commenced under Pope John XXIII on 8 October 1960, and Kozal became titled as a Servant of God as a result; Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski opened the informative process on 8 October 1960, and this process later closed on 29 August 1964 with the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validating the process on 27 September 1986 and receiving the Positio in 1987. Theologians approved the cause on 24 March 1987, as did the C.C.S. on 28 April 1987. On 8 May 1987 he was confirmed to have died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith), and so Pope John Paul II approved the beatification. John Paul II beatified Bishop Kozal during his visit to Poland on 14 June 1987. Kozal has been the patron for W≈Çoc≈Çawek since 8 October 2002 and the patron for Krotoszyn since 9 June 2013.

He is known for developing a circus act of juggling with the feet known as the Risley act. He also notably brought a Japanese circus act briefly to America in the 1860s. Biography Richard Risley Carlisle was born in Burlington County, New Jersey in 1814.Groves, Dana. Images of America: New Carlisle. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2010: 7. On October 15, 1833, he married Rebecca C. Willits of Philadelphia, though her father sued him a year later for unknown reasons.Schodt, Frederik L.

In 1835, he offered $2,000 to purchase 160 acres from Lazarus Bourissa, a Potowatami, to establish what is now New Carlisle, Indiana. His first noted performance as a circus performer was in 1841; he came to be known professionally under the name \\"Professor Risley\\".Groves, Dana. Images of America: New Carlisle. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2010: 52. Some time before 1850, he teamed with John Rowson Smith to establish a traveling panorama display of the Mississippi River to compete with John Banvard. A minor rivalry between the two acts soon arose, with Banvard calling Smith and Carlisle imposters; they in turn referred to the \\"crude efforts of the uncultivated artist\\" Banvard.Huhtamo, Erkki. Illusions in Motion: Media Archaeology of the Moving Panorama and Related Spectacles. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2013: 187‚Äì188.

Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1993: 51. George Catlin accused Banvard of copying his own paintings, but Banvard responded that his panorama was copied by Catlin for use by Smith and Risley.Hanners, John. \\"It was Play Or Starve\\": Acting in the Nineteenth Century American Popular Theatre.

The act involves the performer lying on his or her back on a chair and juggling children with the feet, an act also used by the Hanlon-Lees and others.Cosdon, Mark. The Hanlon Brothers: From Daredevil Acrobatics to Spectacle Pantomime, 1833-1931. Southern Illinois University Press, 2009: 10. It has alternatively been referred to as the \\"Risley business\\"Picton, Col. Tom. Old Gotham Theatricals. San Bernardino, CA: The Borgo Press, 1995: 155. or the \\"Risley stunt\\".Law, Jonathan. The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre. London: Market House Books, 2011: 4. Carlisle developed this act as early as 1840‚Äì1841. The act has since come to refer to juggling anything with the feet while lying on one's back. Carlisle moved to Japan in 1864 and is recognized as the first Western professional acrobat in that country. Two years later, financial concerns forced him to pursue the dairy business; he became the first seller of both milk and ice in Japan. He eventually returned to performing and moved back to the United States, bringing with him a troupe of professional Japanese acrobats who already mastered traditional Japanese acrobat acts. The Imperial Japanese Troupe, as they were called, had their east coast debut in Philadelphia and performed there for a month in 1867.Schodt, Frederik L.

Profile. Page iv. PerfumersWorld Ltd. Partnership. 3rd Ed. Background In 1971 Dowthwaite started as an apprentice at Picot Laboratories in London, England. Picot was one of the last perfume houses in the UK to create, compound, package and distribute their own fragrances. He trained under the perfumer Kenneth Burrows, and ex-Guerlain compounder Brian Maquaire. He later worked in milled soap manufacture and became manager of the cosmetic chemistry department of Grossmiths Co. Ltd. From there went on to become a perfumer at R. Sarant & Co. Ltd. and then Norda Schimmel Co. Ltd. Between 1979 and 1988 he had two careers, as a London Metropolitan Police officer and a freelance perfumer working with several companies, notably Quintessence Fragrances Ltd., suppliers to the Body Shop and Cosmetics-To-Go (now Lush). He states that police training was a major influence on his perfumery career using the systems he had learned as a policeman and applying them to perfumery creation and manufacture. Using a fusion of this systematic approach to perfumery with computer programming wrote the perfume creation software \\"The Perfumer's Workbook\\" which generates perfume formulations from odour descriptions. In 1989, Dowthwaite moved to Bangkok, Thailand and set up agencies for Quintessence Fragrances Ltd., including training the sales staff of agents. In 1991, he set up the fragrance division of Adinop Co. Ltd., the first perfume compounding facility in Thailand, using a forerunner of the ABC's of Perfumery system for creation and manufacture. From 1996 under the sponsorship of The National Science and Technology Development Agency Dowthwaite worked with Thai-China Flavors and Fragrances Co. Ltd. and Guanghouz Baihua Flavours and Fragrances Co. Ltd. as assistant director, perfumer, technical consultant and trainer.  PerfumersWorld  In 1998, he formed PerfumersWorld to distribute the newly launched The Perfumer's Workbook.

The lake is located in a basin setting of wooded rolling sand hills approximately 3 miles south of Good Harbor Bay and the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The M-22, a State of Michigan scenic heritage route, skirts Lime Lake to the north.  Description  The lake is approximately 1.6 miles long, from south to north, and 1.1 miles wide, from east to west, and 65 ft at its deepest. It covers 670 acres. Lime Lake is part of the Good Harbor Bay watershed. In addition to a number of small creeks and springs, it is fed by Lime Creek at the southwestern corner of the lake. Shetland Creek flows out of the north end of the lake and into Little Traverse Lake, and from there Shalda Creek flows out of Little Traverse Lake and into Good Harbor Bay on Lake Michigan. Migratory fish from Lake Michigan have access to Lime Lake through this connection when there are no beaver dams or other natural obstructions. Chinook salmon have been observed spawning in Lime Creek. Lime Lake has a healthy fish community with abundant species diversity including brown trout, largemouth bass, northern pike, and smallmouth bass.Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources 2011, Status of the Fishery Resource Report The south and north ends of the lake feature lowland swamps dominated by cedar, hemlock, and birch trees. Rolling hillsides to the east and west feature upland hardwoods and conifers. Teichner Preserve, a 41-acre parcel located on the northeast shore of the lake, was gifted to the Leelanau Conservancy in 1996. Open to the public, a trail and boardwalk lead through extensive wetlands and forested lowlands to the lake shore. The Lime Lake Association is the riparian association representing property owners on Lime Lake.  Lumber- era history  In the late 19th century the lumber industry dominated the area. The Lime Lake Lumber Company mill was constructed around 1880. Timber harvested from the surrounding land was cut at the mill, and then hauled down a 3-mile plank road to Good Harbor Bay for shipping. The northeastern corner of the lake has some slabwood remnants easily visible on the shallow bottom.  Geological history  Lime Lake is a glacial lake, formed by natural and geologic forces. With the re-treat of the Laurentian Glacier, approximately 11,000 BP (before present), and the ice burden gone, the earth‚Äôs crust in the northern part of the region began to rise. Over time the shoreline of the proglacial Lake Algonquin Lake Algonquin evolved with long peninsulas and bays becoming truncated from the main body lake to form separate lakes. At Good Harbor Bay, Lime Lake as well as neighboring Bass and School lakes, all at an elevation of 620 feet, were closed off early during the Lake Algonquin stage (about 7,000 years ago). During the Lake Nipissing stage (about 6,000 to 4,000 years ago), a crescent-shaped belt of dunes closed off Little Traverse Lake.The Glacial Lakes around Michigan, By William R.

The initial assets were some 247,747 Thaler and the Count of Hoym who administered royal affairs in Silesia had a mathematician calculate that, as the number of initial beneficiaries was so small, the interest would accrue to the extent that in a few decades the assets would exceed those of the State of Prussia.Gust. Freytag: ‚ÄòPictures from the German Past‚Äô, Ch IV, p. 469 and 470 A long process of negotiation with the King concluded with half the assets being kept for beneficiaries and the remainder was used to build the first state 'Werksschulen' in Silesia, thus paving the way for state education.

The story delves into the life of Ben Lovatt following the events of the first book dedicated to this character, The Fifth Child. Plot Ben, in the World takes place a number of years after the events in The Fifth Child. In the beginning of Ben, in the World, Ben Lovatt is 18-years-old and living with an elderly lady named Mrs. Biggs. However, she cannot afford to support the both of them, and sends Ben to his estranged family to ask for his birth certificate so that he can get an unemployment benefit. By the time Ben returns (without the birth certificate), he learns that Mrs. Biggs has passed away. He goes to a couple that had looked after him before he'd met Mrs. Biggs: Rita, a prostitute he'd once had a recurring relationship with, and Johnston, her procurer. Johnston comes up with a plan to smuggle a large amount of narcotics into France, which would give him and Rita enough money to permanently get off the streets, using Ben. The plan succeeds, and effectively allows him and Rita to cease being responsible for Ben, as they leave him in France under the temporary care of Richard, one of Johnston's men, in an expensive hotel, with a cut from the smuggling deal. Soon after Richard leaves Ben in the hotel, Ben meets Alex, a film producer who decides to make a film about Ben, set in Rio de Janeiro. He takes Ben to Brazil and introduces Ben to Teresa, an actress who is Alex's girlfriend when he stays in Rio. Teresa grows attached to Ben, and introduces him to Inez (her friend, and a scientist) after Alex abandoned the idea he had of the movie, and Ben himself. This leads to Ben meeting Alfredo, a man who claims to have seen people like Ben before, but doesn't explain where or when. The book climaxes with the scientific institute Inez works for kidnapping Ben to experiment on, Teresa saving him with the help of Alfredo, and a trek into the mountains of Brazil to see the people who are 'like Ben'. As it turns out, those people are only rock paintings. Ben is the only person of his species still alive- he is a step backwards in evolution. The crushing despair Ben feels leads him to throw himself off the edge of a cliff, killing him instantly. This is where the novel ends. Characters *Ben Lovatt.

Reception In his review for The New York Times, Michael Pye said the book \\"lets you see things as Ben sees them, as you have not seen things before. The book shares that uncanny effect with the best fiction.\\" In her analysis of Lessing's experimental comments on literary genre, Susan Watkins argues that by exaggerating the picaresque, Lessing forces her readers \\"to ask a series of questions about the meaning of the distinction between the animal and the human.\\" Watson finds that Ben is \\"a marginal figure, critical of society but unable to find a place outside it\\", like a picaro hero. Lessing uses the figure of Ben \\"as a way to comment on a society experiencing intense social upheaval.\\" While the traditional picaro is a semi-outsider, Ben is much more isolated. Furthermore, it is far more in doubt if he is able \\"to survive by his wits and turn a series of exploitative situations to his advantage (another feature of the genre).\\" Watkins observes that in Ben, in the World prolepsis is used to a humorous effect by which the 'objectivity' of the narrator's voice is being parodied. The device of omniscience is exaggerated so that the reader is made to see how naive it is to believe in what the narrator relates. Another effect of this is, according to Watson, that the reliability of perception is questioned and that any 'commons sense' judgments about Ben's alleged difference from others are called into doubt.Susan Watkins, Doris Lessing, Manchester University Press, Manchester, 2010, , pp. 128-130. By its depicting an outsider, Ben, in the World has recently been seen as comparable to Bartleby, the Scrivener (1853) by Herman Melville, to The Metamorphosis (1912) by Franz Kafka, to The Stranger (1942) by Albert Camus, to Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) by George Orwell, to The Bluest Eye (1970) by Toni Morrison, and to Unaccustomed Earth (2008) by Jhumpa Lahiri.C. Fred Alford: Politics Through Popular Fiction and Short Stories, Spring term 2014: \\"In one way or another, all the books and short stories in this course are all about outsiders. Some are outsiders by choice, most not. Each is an outsider in a different way.\\" References  External links  * PBS interview with Lessing Category:2000 British novels Category:2000 fantasy novels Category:Novels by Doris Lessing Category:Sequel novels ","title":"Ben, in the World"},{"id":"43357308","text":"Ludwig H√∂rmann (6 September 1918 ‚Äì 19 June 2001) was a German cyclist.

Until mid 2003 the NAD was headed by President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), then Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee. After President Abbas was selected by the Palestinian Legislative Council in April 2003 to become the first Palestinian Prime Minister, Dr. Saeb Erekat, former Minister for Local Government and Chief Palestinian Negotiator was nominated as Head of the NAD by the PLO. The NAD has two offices ‚Äì one in Gaza and a second in Ramallah. The NAD office in Gaza is composed of units responsible for Israeli affairs, Israel‚Äôs violations of signed agreements, Israel‚Äôs colonization (illegal settlement policies), and Palestinian refugees. The Ramallah office is responsible for following up on the Interim Agreements and preparing Palestinian positions for the Permanent Status talks with Israel. The office is therefore structured into six units: Israeli Affairs, Research and Information, Interim Agreement, Permanent Status, Public Relations, and Administrative and Finance.  The Negotiations Support Project  In late 1998 the NAD approached the Government of the United Kingdom seeking technical assistance to its preparations for Permanent Status talks. The U.K. Department for International Development consequently agreed to support the establishment of the Negotiations Support Project in Ramallah. The purpose of the Negotiations Support Project is to provide highly professional legal, policy and communications advice to the NAD and Palestinian negotiators in preparation for, and during, Permanent Status negotiations with Israel. Following the collapse of formal negotiations at the outset of 2001, an additional purpose of the project is to encourage the resumption of Permanent Status negotiations by contributing to a variety of diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing the two sides back together. Following the establishment of the Negotiations Support Project, the governments of Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden also agreed to support the project. Since that time, these five governments have continuously provided funding to the project and have committed to doing so until today. The Negotiations Support Project has two main departments: the Legal & Policy Department and the Communications Department. The Legal & Policy Department has three objectives. The first is to strengthen and refine existing Palestinian negotiation positions. The second is to develop new positions where no policy previously existed. The third is to contribute to interim initiatives intended either to lead Palestine and Israel out of the current political crisis and towards resumption of permanent status negotiations or to minimize the damage inflicted by continuing Israeli actions on the likelihood of a fair and sustainable outcome to permanent status negotiations. The Department provides advice on the permanent status issues (security, settlements, Jerusalem, refugees, borders and water), as well as other issues (economic relations, compensation, agriculture, tourism, health, transport, energy, telecommunications and archaeology). The Communications Department aims to explain and increase support for the Palestinian positions on permanent status issues and interim initiatives, to mobilize local and international civil society organizations to undertake advocacy on behalf of those positions, and to overcome misperceptions held by the Israeli public concerning Palestinian goals and intentions towards Israel. In essence the Department publicizes and explains Palestinian negotiation positions in order to confront and balance out alternative misleading narratives, thereby creating an atmosphere that will both allow negotiations to occur and increase the likelihood of a fair and sustainable outcome. The Department achieves its goals through a range of communications activities such as providing briefings to international journalists, parliamentarians and representatives of civil society; facilitating their access to the PLO leadership; providing communications advice to that leadership; publishing fact sheets, maps, and newsletters on key topics; maintaining the website of the NAD; lobbying editorial boards of international media organizations to ensure accurate reporting; building an email distribution list for NAD materials, and undertaking outreach activities in the United States, Europe and Israel.  Activities  In November 2008, PLO's Negotiations Department published ads promoting the Arab Peace Initiative in Israeli dailies. According to Yossi Alpher it was the first time a leading Arab institution published a \\"peace ad\\" in the Israeli press. In response, the Israeli activist group Peace Now published ads in Palestinian press.

It was one of the 6 original \\"Iron and Steel\\" Divisions of the Viet Minh. First Indochina War In December 1953 the 325th took part in the Viet Minh probe into Laos. In late December 1953 seven battalions from Regiment 101 of the 325th and Regiment 66 of the 304th Division moving from Vinh attacked isolated French outposts in the Annamite Range in Annam and Central Laos. Vietnam War In early 1961 the Division was sent to Laos to support Pathet Lao forces and on 11 April captured Tchepone. This secured an essential area for the expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The Division's 95th Regiment arrived in Kon Tum Province in December 1964. In February 1965 the 95th was joined by the 101st Regiment. U.S intelligence indicated that the 325C Division was operating in the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone by July 1967. On 3 February 1968, a battalion of the 325C attacked the Marines on Hill 861A north of Khe Sanh Combat Base, the attack was repulsed with 7 Marines and 109 PAVN killed. On the night of 6/7 February, the 101st Regiment and the 22nd Regiment (attached to the 304th Division), supported by 12 PT-76 lights tanks of the 203rd Armored Regiment overran the US special forces camp at Lang Vei killing 316 of the camp's defenders including seven Americans for the loss of 90 PAVN killed and seven tanks destroyed. On 8 February a reinforced Battalion of the 101st Regiment attacked a 9th Marines' position west of the Combat Base, 21 Marines and 150 PAVN were killed. On 12 July 1972 the Division together with the 312th Division was sent to support the Second Battle of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. On 15 May 1974 the Division's 95th Regiment attacked Dak Pek Camp overrunning one of the last Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) bases on Route 14. On 17 May 1974 PAVN 2nd Corps was formed comprising the Division, the 304th and 324th Divisions, the 673rd Air Defense Division, the 164th Artillery Brigade, the 203rd tank Brigade, the 219th Engineer Brigade and the 463rd Signal Regiment under the command of Major General Ho√†ng VƒÉn Th√°i. As part of the Hue-Da Nang Campaign on 19 March the Division and the 324th Division attacked the ARVN 1st Division and the 15th Ranger Group along Route 1 south of Hu·∫ø. On the afternoon of 22 March the 324th pushed the 15th Rangers out of Ph√∫ L·ªôc cutting Route 1 and forcing the ARVN forces to withdraw back to a defensive line around Phu Bai Combat Base On 24 March all ARVN forces were ordered to abandon Hu·∫ø and regroup in Danang, a disorganised seaborne evacuation followed and by 25 March the PAVN was in control of the city. For the attack on Danang, by 26 March the Division advanced from the north, the 9th Regiment of the 304th was located northwest of Danang, while the rest of the 304th and 711th Divisions encircled from the south and the 3rd Regiment of the 324th was located southwest of the city. By the afternoon of 29 March the 2nd Corps had penetrated the ARVN defences and entered the city which finally fell on 31 March. On 16 April the Division's 101st Regiment captured Phan Rang and then after defeating several ARVN counterattacks captured Phan Rang Air Base. On 18 April the Division's 18th Regiment captured Phan Thi·∫øt. By 26 April the Division and the 304th Division were attacking Route 15, the last overland link between Saigon and Vung Tau.

The album features a more uptempo style of rockabilly in comparison to May's previous releases, with several critics drawing comparisons to the psychobilly punk band the Cramps and artists such as the B-52s. The album was supported by two singles: \\"It's Good to Be Alive\\" and \\"Wild Woman\\". Upon its release, Tribal received generally favourable acclaim and placed in several international charts‚Äîincluding Ireland, where it debuted at number 1; the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 3; and New Zealand, where it placed in the top 20. Release Tribal was announced for release in early 2014. In the original announcement the album was planned for release in June 2014, although the official date was moved forward and Tribal was released on 25 April on Decca Records. The album was made available on CD, LP and as a digital download. Tribal is due to be released in the United States on 23 September on Verve Records. Two singles were released from Tribal. Its lead single, \\"It's Good to Be Alive\\", was released on 1 March 2014; the song had debuted prior to its official release when May performed it on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno in November 2013.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 11 reviews, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". AllMusic writer Matt Collar awarded Tribal three-and-a-half out of five stars and referred to the album as her \\"call to arms; her statement of purpose\\", comparing it to material by Bow Wow Wow, the Cramps and the B-52s. Writing for the Guardian, Caroline Sullivan said that \\"in May's hands, rockabilly is a feral form, vitally alive and compelling\\" and surmised that \\"[Tribal] is no time capsule; it's fresh and bracing\\" in her four out of five star review. In a three-star review for the Independent, Andy Gill noted that on Tribal May is \\"still indulging the boisterous rapscallion character suggested by titles like 'Wild Woman', 'Hellfire Club' and 'Gypsy In Me'\\", adding that \\"there's sweetness to balance the earthier aspects\\". Hot Press rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars. The Irish Times reviewer Tony Clayton-Lea describe the Tribal as \\"an astute mix of signature creative riffs ‚Ä¶ blending film noir-like theme songs with burning and emotive torch ballads\\", rating the album four out of five stars. Phil Mongredien of the Observer was more critical towards the album writing in his review that although \\"May [is] an engaging and entertaining storyteller on the more breakneck material\\", her performance on the album's ballads and low-tempo tracks \\"are less distinguished\\" and \\"more delicate than memorable\\". He awarded the album three out of five stars. PopMatters writer Steve Horowitz said in a seven out of ten review that May \\"ferociously attacks the lyrics\\" on Tribal, \\"growling and stuttering as needed to reveal the urgency exploding inside of her. Meanwhile, the guitars swirl and the drums pound to create the whirlwind in which May operates.\\" Rating the album four of five in State, Graham Mooney concluded that \\"with Tribal, Imelda May continues to impress and surprise in equal measure\\" and referred to the album as \\"the strongest collection of songs [she] has assembled to date.\\" Track listing Personnel All personnel credits adapted from Tribals album notes. ;The Imelda May Band *Imelda May *Darrel Higham *Al Gare *Steve Rushton *Dave Priseman ;Technical personnel *Mike Crossey ‚Äì production, programming *Imelda May ‚Äì production *Jonathan Gilmore ‚Äì engineering *Graham Dominey ‚Äì engineering *Guy Davie ‚Äì mastering ;Design personnel *Stylorouge ‚Äì art direction, design *Barry McCall ‚Äì photography *Rob O'Connor ‚Äì photography Chart positions { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2014) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders)  172 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia)  186 - ! scope=\\"row\\" French Albums Chart  133 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Irish Albums Chart  1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" New Zealand Albums Chart  17 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Spanish Albums Chart  81 - ! scope=\\"row\\" UK Albums Chart  3 } References External links Category:2014 albums Category:Decca Records albums Category:Imelda May albums ","title":"Tribal (album)"},{"id":"43357514","text":"Karl Anthony RacineUniversity of Pennsylvania (Class of 1985) Commencement (born December 14, 1962) is a Haitian-born American lawyer and politician. He is the first independently elected attorney general of the District of Columbia, a position he has held since January 2015. Before that, he was the managing partner of Venable LLP. Early life and education Born in Port-au- Prince, Haiti, Racine and his family fled the Duvalier regime and emigrated to Washington, D.C. when he was three years old. He attended public schools until eighth grade and graduated from St. John's College High School, and was a star high school basketball player. Racine attended the University of Pennsylvania and became the team captain of the basketball team. He led the team to a two Ivy League championships and made the second team all-Ivy League two times. Racine then went to the University of Virginia School of Law, where he worked at a pro bono clinic representing migrant farm workers. He said he was drawn to the law because of the role lawyers played in advancing civil rights. While in law school, he and his mother produced the first Haitian Creole/English legal dictionary, intended to aid Haitian immigrants in the United States. Legal career After graduating from law school in 1989, Racine joined Venable LLP but left in 1992 to become a staff attorney at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia. He then returned to private practice at Cacheris & Treanor, where he handled large white-collar and civil cases, and later served as associate White House counsel in the Clinton administration. In addition, he served as a member of the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission, a selection panel for judges. Racine returned to Venable in 2000 and was elected managing partner in 2006, becoming the first black managing partner of a top-100 law firm. He led the team representing food services corporation Sodexo in a class action racial discrimination suit brought by over 2,500 African American employees, one of the largest such suits brought after the 1991 amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. From 2011 to 2012, Racine represented D.C. Councilmember Harry Thomas Jr., who pleaded guilty after a protracted investigation to diverting $300,000 in grants earmarked for charity and youth baseball groups to pay for personal luxury items. During sentencing, Racine successfully argued that Thomas deserved a lighter sentence because his guilty plea was an example of his commitment to teaching the District's youth how to \\"take responsibility when you have done wrong.\\" Racine later said Thomas \\"needed counsel to represent him zealously\\" and told possible critics, \\"I would represent them if, God forbid, they made significant mistakes, errors and violated the law.\\" In July 2014, Racine led an inquest into state-issued credit card spending by members of the Board of Education in Montgomery County, Maryland, finding no evidence of intentional wrongdoing but recommending that access to the cards be revoked. Campaign for Attorney General In July 2014, Racine announced his candidacy for D.C. Attorney General, prompting friend and fellow prominent white-collar attorney Mark Tuohey to drop out of the race and endorse him, saying he \\"has all the qualifications.\\" On November 4, 2014, Racine became the first elected Attorney General for the District of Columbia, beating out four other challengers with 37% of the vote. Attorney General As Attorney General, Karl Racine has established four priorities for the DC Office of the Attorney General: data- driven juvenile justice reform, protecting consumers from abusive tactics by unscrupulous businesses, preserving affordable housing and protecting tenants in communities across the District, and advancing democracy and safeguarding public integrity. In line with these priorities, Attorney General Racine has helped end mandatory shackling of juveniles appearing before D.C. Superior Court and expanded options for rehabilitating low-risk juvenile offenders. A diversion program that helps these young people get and stay on the right track has achieved a success rate of nearly 80 percent. Under Attorney General Racine, OAG has increased participation in the program five-fold, positively impacting young lives and increasing public safety. In 2015 Attorney General Racine established a standalone Office of Consumer Protection within OAG focused on outreach, education and legal actions to protect consumers. He has brought tens of millions of dollars to the District through settlements and judgments in cases against corporate wrongdoers.

In September 2017, Racine announced he will run for reelection. Racine won reelection in the May 15 general election with 93% of the vote against Libertarian candidate Joe Henchman. Racine has been mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor in 2022, to challenge incumbent Mayor Muriel Bowser. Personal life Racine served as a board member of the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia, as a member of the steering committee of the Whitman-Walker Clinic's Legal Services Program and as a board member of the local literacy organization Everybody Wins.

By 2014, the firm had 40 staff members and had worked on over 2,000 projects. Designing both buildings and interiors their work covers the commercial, residential, restaurant and retail sectors, primarily in London but also across the UK and overseas. Some of their projects include the first Wagamama restaurant in 1992 and the first in the chain of Giraffe Restaurants. They have also designed various Italian restaurants for Jamie Oliver. Their residential clients have included Adele and Blur (band) and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn.  Background  Michael Stiff and Andrew Trevillion were graduates when they founded Stiff + Trevillion in the spring of 1981. In 1991 Stiff and Trevillion designed the first Wagamama restaurant in Bloomsbury which opened in 1992. After Wagamama was finished the practice was asked to create a restaurant with a similar concept of Japanese dining called Satsuma. The dark-stained timber back wall and the black and white terrazzo floor reflected Japanese and Scandinavian influences. Stiff and Trevillion have designed a few buildings abroad. One of their projects was designing Aspria Health Club in Hamburg. They collaborated with Colwyn Foulkes & Partners to fit out a large building. The architects created a two-storey enclosure within the space, the overall approach was to give a sense of arrival to a welcome hub, providing glimpses of the sporting activities on offer. Stiff and Trevillion were chosen to design Jamie's Italian flagship restaurant in Bath. This subsequently led to the firm designing a Jamie's Italian in Guildford and in other cities across the UK. Further work for clients has included Portobello Dock for Derwent London who acquired the site in 2004. Stiff and Trevillion were commissioned to refurbish the building on the north side of the canal and to revitalise the nineteenth century dock site with a mixture of restaurant, office and residential buildings. They completed the construction on the building in 2008. In April 2010 the practice designed the office interiors for Innocent Drinks after winning the competitive creative pitch. In 2012 the practice designed the new interiors for the food and drink chain Eat (restaurant). The practice won a competition in early 2010 to design and implement the new concept of the Metropolitan Costa Coffee. The aim was to refresh the brand image through interior design, emphasising the use of the existing elements such as exposed brick walls and ceilings coupled with concrete flooring and statement lighting. The architect's completed Sloane Street for the Cadogan Estate in 2016. Stiff and Trevillion have designed 5,500sq m of retail space across the ground floor. The other five floors are office spaces.

Jacob's father was the last British-appointed mayor of Albany. Abraham Cuyler remained loyal to the crown, but was banished from New York by the revolutionaries, and lost all of his substantial land holdings in Albany. At the start of the American War of Independence, Jacob Glen Cuyler's father was incarcerated and the family went from exile in New York City to Canada where Abraham Cuyler died in 1810. In 1789, Jacob was among several family members compensated for their American losses by the British with land in Canada. Abraham Cuyler was able to purchase commissions as officiers for his sons in the British army in 1799. Arrival in South Africa In 1806, Jacob Glen Cuyler was a captain in the 59th Regiment of Foot when it sailed from England to South Africa. In October 1808 he married a South African, Maria Elizabeth Hartman, they had two daughters and three sons; none of the sons had issue. His granddaughter was the botanist and botanical illustrator Maria Elizabeth Holland. He settled on a large farm and was one of the founders of Uitenhage, a town in the East Cape district of Albany. The farm museum survives today. According to a newspaper obituary, \\"General Jacob Glen Cuyler died at his residence, Cuyler Manor, near Uitenhage, on Friday, the 14th April [1854].\\" 1820 Settlers Cuyler together with Lord Charles Somerset persuaded the British Parliament to vote funds to finance the settlement of parties of British settlers in order to strengthen the frontier. In 1820 numbers of English and Scots arrived. The Scots were settled in the Baviaans River Mountains, on land confiscated from the Slagtersnek rebels while the English were settled in the Albany district to the south. Slagtersnek Rebellion In 1815, a farmer from the eastern border of the Cape Colony, Frederik Bezuidenhout, was summoned to appear before a magistrate's court after repeated allegations of his mistreating one of his Khoi labourers. Bezuidenhout resisted arrest and fled to a cave near his home where he defended himself against the soldiers sent to capture him. When he refused to surrender he was shot dead by one of the soldiers. Bezuidenhout's brother, Hans, swore revenge. Together with a neighbour Hendrik Prinsloo, Hans Bezuidenhout organised an uprising against the British colonial power, believed by them to be hostile towards the Afrikaner farmers. On 18 November 1815, a commando of rebels met an armed force led by Jacob Glen Cuyler at Slachter's Nek. Negotiations failed but 20 rebels surrendered, followed by several more over the following days. However, some of the leaders, among whom was Hans Bezuidenhout, refused to turn themselves over to Cuyler. On 29 November 1815, they were attacked by colonial troops. Everybody but Bezuidenhout surrendered and, like his brother, Hans died while resisting arrest. The rebels were finally charged at Uitenhage. Some were cleared, others imprisoned or banished, six were sentenced to death but one of these was pardoned by the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset. On 9 March 1816 the remaining five were hanged in public at Van Aardtspos. Four of the nooses broke during the execution due to old ropes being used. The four whose ropes broke, as well as the public, pleaded for their lives but Cuyler ordered that they be hanged a second time and they were hanged one by one. The names of the five who were hanged were Hendrik Prinsloo, Stephanus Bothma, Abraham Bothma, Cornelius Faber and Theunis de Klerk. The hanging of these five caused deep resentment towards the British by the Boers. Commemoration Toposcope, Bathurst Bathurst toposcope plaque The village of Cuylerville was established by British settlers in 1820. They named it in honour of Cuyler, then military commander at Fort Frederick, in recognition of the assistance he rendered them. There is a Cuyler Street in the city of Grahamstown. A toposcope and commemorative cairn in Bathurst mark the spot where Cuyler made his camp while supervising the placing of the 1820 Settlers on their locations. While camped here at the same time Sir Rufane Donkin chose the site for the administrative centre to be named Bathurst. The beacon was erected by Captain W. Bailey as an observing station during his survey of the eastern districts, 1855-1859.

From the early Middle Ages there were bardic schools, that trained individuals in the poetic and musical arts. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools. In the High Middle Ages, new sources of education arose including choir and grammar schools designed to train priests. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had charitable almonry schools to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood. Some abbeys opened their doors to teach the sons of gentlemen. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. In rural areas there were petty or reading schools that provided an elementary education. Private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers sometimes developed into \\"household schools\\". Girls of noble families were taught in nunneries and by the end of the fifteenth century Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as \\"sewing schools\\". There is documentary evidence for about 100 schools of these different kinds before the Reformation. The growing humanist-inspired emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496. After the Protestant party became dominant in 1560, the First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible. In the burghs the existing schools were largely maintained, with the song schools and a number of new foundations becoming reformed grammar schools or ordinary parish schools. There were also large number of unregulated private \\"adventure schools\\". Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Acts in 1616, 1633, 1646, and 1696 obliged local landowners (heritors) to provide a schoolhouse and pay a schoolmaster, known in Scotland as a dominie, while ministers and local presbyteries oversaw the quality of the education. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas. In the eighteenth century, wealth from the Agricultural Revolution led to a programme of extensive rebuilding of schools. Many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or spinster to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century. With urbanisation and population growth the kirk established 214 \\"assembly schools\\" by 1865. There were also 120 \\"sessional schools\\", mainly established by kirk sessions in towns and aimed at the children of the poor. The Disruption of 1843, which created the breakaway Free Church of Scotland, fragmented the kirk school system. By May 1847 it was claimed that 500 schools had been built, along with two teacher training colleges and a ministerial training college. The influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants in the nineteenth century led to the establishment of Catholic schools. Attempts to supplement the parish system included Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. The ragged school movement attempted to provide free education to destitute children. Andrew Bell pioneered the Monitorial System, which developed into the pupil-teacher system of training. In contrast David Stow, advocated the \\"Glasgow method\\", which centred on trained adult teachers. Scottish schoolmasters gained a reputation for strictness and frequent use of the tawse. The 1872 Education (Scotland) Act created approximately 1,000 regional School Boards, which immediately took over the schools of the old and new kirks. The emphasis on a set number of passes at exams also led to much learning by rote and the system of inspection led to even the weakest children being drilled with certain facts. The 1918 Education (Scotland) Act introduced the principle of universal free secondary education. Most of the advanced divisions of the primary schools became junior secondaries, while the old academies and Higher Grade schools became senior secondaries. Increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and the leaving age was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area of growth, particularly for girls. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations. In the 1980s the curriculum was reformed to take account of the whole range of abilities. Gender differences disappeared as girls' attainment caught up with boys in the early 1980s. Middle Ages =Early Middle Ages= A French illustration of teaching from the late fourteenth century From the early Middle Ages there were bardic schools, that trained individuals in the poetic and musical arts, but because Scotland was a largely oral society, little evidence of what they taught has survived.K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. The establishment of Christianity from the sixth century brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. In the early Middle Ages monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 128. =High Middle Ages= In the High Middle Ages, new sources of education arose. Choir and grammar schools were designed to train priests, with an emphasis respectively on music and Latin grammar. The reorganisation of the church that began in the reign of David I (1124‚Äì53) gave the church a clearer diocesan and parochial structure, meaning that the seats of sheriffdoms like Perth received schools that were usually under monastic patrons. Early examples of grammar schools include the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church. The newly created diocesan chancellors may have had authority over cathedral schools and schoolmasters within their diocese.S. Murdoch, \\"Schools and schooling: I to 1696\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 561‚Äì3. The new religious orders that became a major feature of Scottish monastic life in this period also brought new educational possibilities and the need to train larger numbers of monks. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had almonry schools, charity schools using funds from the almoner to provide a type of bursary to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood.S. Boynton, \\"Boy singers in Monasteries and Cathedrals\\", in S. Boynton and E. N. Rice eds, Young Choristers: 650‚Äì1700 (Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2008), , p. 44. At the Cluniac Paisley Abbey, secular chaplains were employed as schoolmasters. Some monasteries, including the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, Sweetheart Abbey and Beauly, opened their doors to a wider range of students to teach the sons of gentlemen. St Andrews, which was both the seat of a bishop and the site of a major Augustinian foundation, had both a grammar school, under the archdeacon, and a song school, under the priory. =Late Middle Ages= alt=A colour painting of a man with a bishop's mitre and crook praying, with a window in the background The number and size of song and grammar schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. The foundation of over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests between 1450 and the Reformation would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers. Sometimes, as at Lochwinnoch, they were taught both music and grammar. Dominican friars were noted for their educational achievementsJ. P. Foggie, Renaissance Religion in Urban Scotland: The Dominican Order, 1450‚Äì1560 (BRILL, 2003), , p. 101. and were usually located in urban centres, probably teaching grammar, as at Glasgow and Ayr. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Educational provision was probably much weaker in rural areas, but there were petty or reading schools in rural areas that provided an elementary education.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , pp. 104‚Äì7. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers. Sometimes these developed into \\"household schools\\", that may also have catered to farming neighbours and kin, as well as the sons of the laird's household, which is known to have happened at Huntly. All these schools were almost exclusively aimed at boys. Girls of noble families were taught in nunneries such as Elcho, Aberdour and Haddington. By the end of the fifteenth century Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as \\"sewing schools\\", whose name probably indicates one of their major functions, although reading may also have been taught in these schools.E. Ewen, \\"'Hamperit in ane hony came': sights, sounds and smells in the Medieval town\\", in E. J. Cowan and L. Henderson, A History of Everyday Life in Medieval Scotland: 1000 to 1600 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), , p. 126. The students were probably taught by a combination of lay women and nuns. There is documentary evidence for about 100 schools of these different kinds before the Reformation. Most of the schoolmasters of these schools were clergy, and also chaplains of religious foundations, hospitals or private chaplains of noblemen, which they probably undertook in order to supplement merge incomes.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 106. To some extent, all education was controlled by different branches of the church, but towards the end of the period there was an increasing lay interest. This sometimes resulted in conflict, as between the burgh of Aberdeen and the cathedral chancellor, when the former appointed a lay graduate as schoolmaster in 1538, and when a married man was appointed to the similar post in Perth. Education began to widen beyond the training of the clergy, particularly as lay lawyers began to emerge as a profession, with a humanist emphasis on educating the future ruling class for their duties.I. S. Ross, William Dunbar (Brill Archive, 1981), , p. 75. The growing humanist- inspired emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, thought to have been steered through parliament by the Keeper of the Privy Seal William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \\"perfyct Latyne\\". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 29‚Äì30. with perhaps 60 per cent of the male nobility being literate by the end of the period.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 68‚Äì72. Early modern era =Sixteenth century= John Knox, the main architect of the First Book of Discipline, which set out a plan for a school in every parish The humanist concern with increasing public access to education was shared by the Protestant reformers, who saw schools as vehicles for the provision of moral and religious education for a more godly society. After the Protestant party became dominant in 1560, the First Book of Discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 5. In the burghs the existing schools were largely maintained, with the song schools and a number of new foundations becoming reformed grammar schools or ordinary parish schools. Schools were supported by a combination of kirk funds, contributions from local heritors or burgh councils and parents that could pay. They were inspected by kirk sessions of local elders, which checked for the quality of teaching and doctrinal purity.M. Todd, The Culture of Protestantism in Early Modern Scotland (Yale University Press, 2002), , pp. 59‚Äì62. There were also large number of unregulated private \\"adventure schools\\". These were often informally created by parents in agreement with unlicensed schoolmasters, using available buildings and are chiefly evident in the historical record through complaints and attempts to suppress them by kirk sessions because they took pupils away from the official parish schools. However, such private schools were often necessary given the large populations and scale of some parishes. They were often tacitly accepted by the church and local authorities and may have been particularly important to girls and the children of the poor.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , pp. 115‚Äì6. Outside of the established burgh schools, which were generally better funded and more able to pay schoolmasters, masters often combined their position with other employment, particularly minor posts within the kirk, such as clerk. Immediately after the Reformation they were in short supply, but there is evidence that the expansion of the university system provided large numbers of graduates by the seventeenth century. There is evidence of about 800 schools for the period between 1560 and 1633. The parish schools were \\"Inglis\\" schools, teaching in the vernacular and taking children to the age of about 7, while the grammar schools took boys to about 12. At their best in the grammar schools, the curriculum included the catechism, Latin, French, Classical literature and sports.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 183‚Äì3. The widespread belief in the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even to be able to independently read the Bible, but most commentators of the period, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , pp. 63‚Äì8. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.K. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from Reformation to Revolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 187. =Seventeenth century= A carving of a seventeenth- century classroom with a dominie and his ten scholars, from George Heriot's School, Edinburgh In 1616 an act in Privy council commanded every parish to establish a school \\"where convenient means may be had\\". After the Parliament of Scotland ratified this law and the Education Act of 1633, a tax on local landowners was introduced to provide the necessary endowment.. From 1638 Scotland underwent a \\"second Reformation\\", with widespread support for a National Covenant, objecting to the Charles I's liturgical innovations and reaffirming the Calvinism and Presbyterianism of the kirk. After the Bishop's Wars (1639‚Äì40), Scotland had virtual independence from the government in Westminster.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , p. 204. Education remained fundamental to the ideas of the Covenanters. A loophole which allowed evasion of the education tax was closed in the Education Act of 1646, which established a solid institutional foundation for schools on Covenanter principles, emphasising the role of presbyteries in supervision.J. R. Young, \\"The Covenanters and the Scottish Parliament 1639‚Äì51: the rule of the Godly and the second Scottish Reformation\\", in E. Boran and C. Gribben, Enforcing Reformation in Ireland and Scotland: 1550‚Äì1700 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), , p. 143. Although the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 brought a reversal to the 1633 position, in 1696 new legislation restored the provisions of 1646 together with means of enforcement \\"more suitable to the age\\" and underlined the aim of having a school in every parish. In rural communities these acts obliged local landowners (heritors) to provide a schoolhouse and pay a schoolmaster, known in Scotland as a dominie, while ministers and local presbyteries oversaw the quality of the education. In many Scottish towns, burgh schools were operated by local councils. Some wealthy individuals established \\"hospitals\\", boarding schools for deserving pupils, such as George Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh, which was founded in 1628 and whose impressive building was opened in 1656 for 180 boys. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish Education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post- Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 219‚Äì28. Eighteenth century =School building= The old school at Kingsford, East Ayrshire Hospitals continued to be built by benefactors and some of these had very impressive buildings, like that of Robert Gordon's Hospital in Aberdeen, which was designed by William Adam (1689‚Äì1748) in the 1730s. Until the late eighteenth century most schools buildings were indistinguishable from houses, but the wealth from the Agricultural Revolution led to a programme of extensive rebuilding. Most schools had a single schoolroom, which could hold up to 80 pupils, were taught by a single schoolmaster. There might be smaller adjoining rooms for the teaching of infants and girls. There was sometimes with a schoolmaster's house in the same style nearby. Many burgh schools moved away from this model of teaching from the late eighteenth century as the new commercial and vocational subjects led to the employment of more teachers. From the 1790s urban schools were often rebuild in a more imposing classical style, from public subscription, or a legacy, and renamed academies.R. D. Anderson, \\"Buildings: 2 educational\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 53‚Äì5. =Democratic myth= One of the effects of the extensive network of parish schools was the growth of the \\"democratic myth\\", which in the nineteenth century created the widespread belief that many a \\"lad of pairts\\" had been able to rise up through the system to take high office and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England. Historians now accept that very few boys were able to pursue this route to social advancement and that literacy was not noticeably higher than in comparable nations, as the education in the parish schools was basic and short and attendance was not compulsory.T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation, 1700‚Äì2000 (London: Penguin Books, 2001), , pp. 91‚Äì100. =Girls= By the eighteenth century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or spinster to teach reading, sewing and cooking.B. Gatherer, \\"Scottish teachers\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , p. 1022. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised.K. Glover, Elite Women and Polite Society in Eighteenth-Century Scotland (Boydell Press, 2011), , p. 26. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 per cent from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries, and perhaps 85 per cent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 72. =Highlands= In the Scottish Highlands, popular education was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, as well as teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in the Highlands was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture.C. Kidd, British Identities Before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), , p. 138. Literacy rates were lower in the Highlands than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 70. Nineteenth century =Church schools= A schoolmaster administering punishment with the tawse As society urbanised and population expanded there was a growing shortfall in provision. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland formed an education committee in 1824. The committee had established 214 \\"assembly schools\\" by 1865. There were also 120 \\"sessional schools\\", mainly established by kirk sessions in towns and aimed at the children of the poor.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 111. The Disruption of 1843, which created the breakaway Free Church of Scotland, fragmented the kirk school system. 408 teachers in schools joined the breakaway Free Church. By May 1847 it was claimed that 500 schools had been built, along with two teacher training colleges and a ministerial training college,G. Parsons, \\"Church and state in Victorian Scotland: disruption and reunion\\", in G. Parsons and J. R. Moore, eds, Religion in Victorian Britain: Controversies (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988), , p. 116. 513 schoolmasters were being paid direct from a central education fund and over 44,000 children being taught in Free Church schools.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 397. The influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants in the nineteenth century led to the establishment of Catholic schools, particularly in the urban west of the country, beginning with Glasgow in 1817.J. C. Conroy, \\"Catholic Education in Scotland\\", in M. A. Hayes and L. Gearon, eds, Contemporary Catholic Education (Gracewing, 2002), , p. 23. By 1872 there were 65 Catholic schools with 12,000 pupils. The church schools system was now divided between three major bodies, the established Kirk, the Free Church and the Catholic Church. =Supplementary education= Attempts to supplement the parish system included Sunday schools. Originally begun in the 1780s by town councils, they were adopted by all religious denominations in the nineteenth century. The movement peaked in the 1890s. By 1890 the Baptists had more Sunday schools than churches and were teaching over 10,000 children. In 1895, 50,000 teachers were working within the Church of Scotland in these schoolsC. Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), , p. 130. and 60 per cent of children aged 5‚Äì15 in Glasgow were enrolled on their books.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Missions at Home\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 423. From the 1830s and 1840s there were also mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes, open to members of all forms of Protestantism and particularly aimed at the growing urban working classes.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 403. The ragged school movement attempted to provide free education to destitute children. The ideas were taken up in Aberdeen where Sheriff William Watson founded the House of Industry and Refuge, and they were championed by Scottish minister Thomas Guthrie who wrote Plea for Ragged Schools (1847), after which they rapidly spread across Britain.G. Morton, Ourselves and Others: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2012), , p. 181. =Theory and practice= Scots played a major part in the development of teacher education. Andrew Bell (1753‚Äì1832) pioneered the Monitorial System, by which the more able pupils would pass on the information they had learned to other children and which developed into the pupil-teacher system of training. It was further developed by John Wood, Sheriff-Depute of Peebles, who tended to favour fierce competition in the classroom and strict discipline. In contrast David Stow (1793‚Äì1864), who founded the first infant school in Scotland, in Glasgow in 1828, emphasised the importance of play and was highly influential on the development of the idea of school playgrounds.C. Burke and I. Grosvenor, School (Reaktion Books, 2008), , pp. 37‚Äì38. He focused on the bond between teacher and child and advocated the \\"Glasgow method\\", which centred on trained adult teachers. He established the first teacher training college in the United Kingdom, the Glasgow Normal Seminary. When, after the Great Disruption it was declared the property of the Church of Scotland, he founded the Free Church Normal Seminary in 1845.T. M. Devine, Glasgow: 1830 to 1912 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1996), , pp. 398‚Äì9. Ultimately Wood's ideas played a greater role in the Scottish educational system as they fitted with the need for rapid expansion and low costs that resulted from the reforms of 1872. Scottish schoolmasters gained a reputation for strictness and frequent use of the tawse, a belt of horse hide split at one end that inflicted stinging punishment on the hands of pupils.M. Peters, \\"Scottish education: an international perspective\\" in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 1024. =Commissions= George Douglas Campbell, the Duke of Argyll (c. 1860) by George Frederic Watts The perceived problems and fragmentation of the Scottish school system led to a process of secularisation, as the state took increasing control. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants, then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship. The 1861 Education Act removed the provision stating that Scottish teachers had to be members of the Church of Scotland or subscribe to the Westminster Confession. In 1866 the government established the Argyll Commission, under Whig grandee George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, to look into the schooling system. It found that of 500,000 children in need of education 200,000 were receiving it under efficient conditions, 200,000 in schools of doubtful merit, without any inspection and 90,000 were receiving no education at all. Although this compared favourably with the situation in England, with 14 per cent more children in education and with relatively low illiteracy rates of between 10 and 20 per cent, similar to those in the best educated nations such as those in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Scandinavia, the report was used as support for widespread reform. The result was the 1872 Education (Scotland) Act, based on that passed for England and Wales as the Elementary Education Act in 1870, but providing a more comprehensive solution. =1872 act= Under the act approximately 1,000 regional School Boards were establishedL. Patterson, \\"Schools and schooling: 3. Mass education 1872‚Äìpresent\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 566‚Äì9. and, unlike in England where they merely attempted to fill gaps in provision, immediately took over the schools of the old and new kirks and were able to begin to enforce attendance, rather than after the decade necessary in England. Some ragged and industrial schools requested to be taken over by the boards, while others continued as Sunday schools. All children aged from 5 to 13 years were to attend. Poverty was not accepted as an excuse and some help was supplied under the poor law. This was enforced by the School Attendance Committee, while the boards busied themselves with building to fill the gaps in provision. This resulted in a major programme that created large numbers of grand, purpose-built schools.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 112‚Äì13. Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch (later Scottish) Education Department in London.. Demand for places was high and for a generation after the act there was overcrowding in many classrooms, with up to 70 children being taught in one room. The emphasis on a set number of passes at exams also led to much learning by rote and the system of inspection led to even the weakest children being drilled with certain facts. There was an extensive programme of school building undertaken by the boards between 1872 and 1914. Where there was space these new board schools were two stories tall, but on crowded urban sites they could be four stories tall and designed to house 1,000 children. The Episcopalian and Catholic schools remained outside of the system, with the number of Catholic schools growing to 188 by 1900, serving 58,000 pupils. =Secondary education= The Mearns Street Public School built for the Greenock Burgh School Board still bears its name, carved on the stone pediment above the entrance Unlike the English act, the Scottish one made some provision for secondary education.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 114‚Äì15. The Scottish Education Department intended to expand secondary education, but did not intend to produce a universal system. The preferred method was to introduce vocational supplementary teaching in the elementary schools, later known as advanced divisions, up until the age of 14, when pupils would leave to find work. This was controversial because it seemed to counter the cherished principle that schooling was a potential route to university for the bright \\"lad o' parts\\". Larger urban school boards established about 200 \\"higher grade\\" (secondary) schools as a cheaper alternative to the burgh schools. Some of these were former grammar schools, such as the Glasgow and Edinburgh High Schools, Aberdeen New High School and Perth Academy. Some hospitals became day schools and largely remained independent, while a few, including Fettes College in Edinburgh, became public schools on the English model. Other public schools emerged around the mid century, such as Merchiston, Loretto School and Trinity College, Glenalmond. The result of these changes was a fear that secondary education became much harder to access for the children of the poor. However, in the second half of the century roughly a quarter of university students can be described as having working class origins, largely from the skilled and independent sectors of the economy. The Scottish Education Department introduced a Leaving Certificate Examination in 1888 to set national standards for secondary education. In 1890 school fees were abolished, creating a state- funded, national system of compulsory free basic education with common examinations. Twentieth century =Early twentieth century= Perth High School, opened in 1950 The 1918 Education (Scotland) Act introduced the principle of universal free secondary education, although, due to financial crisis and resistance from the SED, it took almost two decades to implement. Most of the advanced divisions of the primary schools became junior secondaries, where students received a vocationally orientated education until the age of 14. The old academies and Higher Grade schools became senior secondaries, giving a more academic education, presenting students for the leaving certificate, which was the entry qualification for the universities. Selection between the two types of school was determined at age 12 by an intelligence test, the \\"qualifying examination\\", known colloquially as \\"the qualy\\". The 1918 Act brought the Episcopalian and Roman Catholic schools into the state system. While most Episcopalian schools would be absorbed through local mergers,G. Walker, \\"The religious factor\\", in T. M. Devine, Jenny Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 558. the 224 Catholic schools, with 94,000 pupils in 1918,L. Paterson, Scottish Education in the Twentieth Century (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 40. retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church.C. Harvie, No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-Century Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 3rd edn., 1998), , p. 78. This move led to prolonged objections from some Protestants who complained that the state funding of Catholic schools was \\"Rome on the rates\\".A. Davies, \\"'They sing that song': football and sectarianism in Glasgow in the 1920s and 1930s\\", in J. Flint and J. Kelly, Bigotry, Football, and Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2013), , p. 52. The Act also replaced the School Boards with 38 specialist local education authorities, which were elected by a form of proportional representation in order to protect the rights of the Catholic minority. These would be subsumed into local government in 1929. Between the wars new school building was mainly associated with suburban growth. Space was less constrained and styles tended to be simpler with some experiments in modernism. Unlike the Education Act 1944 in England and Wales, which established the tripartite system, the Education (Scotland) Act 1945 was a consolidation measure, because universal secondary education had already been in place for over a decade. Plans to raise the school leaving age to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, but increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area of growth, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. The 1947 Report on Secondary Education by the Education Advisory Council, established by Labour minister Tom Johnston, proposed an end to selection and, although rejected by Labour and Conservative governments, became a benchmark for reform. =Late twentieth century= Girls at Cranhill Secondary School, Glasgow, 1967. The increased opportunities for girls in secondary education were a major feature of twentieth century schooling. Selection was ended by the Labour government in 1965, which recommended that councils produced one kind of comprehensive secondary school that took all the children in a given neighbourhood. By the late 1970s 75 per cent of children were in non-selective schools and by the early 1980s only the five per cent of children in private schools were subject to selection. New schools were mainly associated with the creation of new towns and housing schemes. There was no distinctive Scottish style of school building in this period and patterns reflected those used in England, tending to be more open in plan and less rigid in design. Existing schools were also adapted for more child-centred learning. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. In the 1980s these were replaced by the Standard Grade qualifications. The greater availability of academic qualifications encouraged students to stay on at school. In 1967 22 per cent of students stayed on beyond age 15, but by 1994 the number staying on beyond 16 was 74 per cent. The reorganisation of local government in 1975, which transferred education to nine mainland and three smaller island authorities, allowing those containing large urban centres, to redistribute resources to poorer areas, making education part of a programme of wider social reform. In the 1980s the curriculum was reformed to take account of the whole range of abilities. In 1955 only 22 per cent of pupils achieved five or more passes at ordinary grade. By 1995 the proportion achieving the equivalent in the standard grade was 55 per cent. Gender differences disappeared as girls' attainment caught up with boys in the early 1980s.

Early years Ren√© Jeanrichard (later shortened to Ren√© Richard) was born on 1 December 1895 in La Chaux-de- Fonds, Switzerland. His father engraved pocket watches. His mother's family were artists. He had two brothers and four sisters. At the age of eleven Ren√© began to work in the watch factory after school. Due to financial difficulties, the family decided to emigrate to Canada, and landed in Quebec City in 1909. At first they stayed in Montreal. Ren√© Richard went on to Edmonton, Alberta, in 1910 with his father and brothers, and then to Cold Lake, Alberta, where they began to work the land. Richard's mother and sisters joined them later. Conditions on the prairies in the early days were brutally demanding, and after some time Richard's father gave up farming. Instead he opened a general store. Ren√© Richard helped his father in the store as a teenager, and made trips into the bush to trap furs. Ren√© was attracted by the lifestyle of the nomadic First Nations people. From 1913 to 1926, travelling by canoe or by snowshoe, Richard traveled widely in northern Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. He voyaged down the Mackenzie River to the Beaufort Sea, and lived for a while with the Inuvialuit. On these expeditions he would make sketches of the scenery. Richard studied drawing and painting in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1926. Artistic career Richard spent 1927‚Äì30 in Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and the Acad√©mie Colarossi. While in Paris he met Clarence Gagnon and James Wilson Morrice. Gagnon encouraged him to devote himself to art. After returning to Alberta in 1930, Richard resumed his former career as a trapper. He made hundreds of sketches during his long wilderness journeys. He would depict landscapes and the camps of prospectors and trappers. This was an intensely productive period, when his unique style began to emerge. With little money, often he would draw on butcher's paper cut into sheets. In 1938 Clarence Gagnon invited him to move to Montreal. That summer he helped Gagnon make an inventory of the work of Horatio Walker, a painter who had recently died, on the √éle d'Orl√©ans near Quebec City. They went to Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, where they stayed with the Cimons, friends of Gagnon. Gagnon helped Ren√© to get seasonal work as a game warden in the Parc de la Montagne de la Table below Mont Albert on the Gasp√© Peninsula. Richard was laid off and returned to Baie-Saint-Paul where the Cimons gave him a place to stay in exchange for doing odd jobs. Richard fell in love with Blanche Cimon, the daughter of the family, and they married in 1942. Richard sold his first paintings in 1943. His first exhibition at L'Art fran√ßais gallery in Montreal was a great success, and his reputation began to grow. In 1948, Richard joined a McGill University-Canadian Museum of Nature expedition to Quebec's Ungava Peninsula. In 1951, he returned to George River with botanist Jacques Rousseau from the Montreal Botanical Gardens. He produced large landscapes between 1950 and 1965 based on memories of these journeys. In 1957 Richard drove with his wife and Gabrielle Roy across the United States to Mexico. His later work mostly depicted the Charlevoix region around Baie-Saint-Paul. Richard's landscapes became highly valued by collectors. When Queen Elizabeth II visited Canada in 1959 she was given one of Richard's paintings by the mayor of Chicoutimi. Richard often exhibited in Quebec City and Montreal. The Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec held a solo exhibition of his work in 1967, and a retrospective ten years later. He received the Order of Canada in 1973. In 1980 Richard was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Ren√© Richard died on 31 March 1982 at Baie Sant-Paul, aged 86. His autobiography Ma vie pass√©e was published in 1990. Work Ren√© Richard sketched with lead pencil, charcoal, soft lead pencil and red pencil, and painted in oil. He is known for his landscapes, drawn or painted in a semi- abstract style. Unlike other Canadian landscapes, Richard's pictures often included trappers, hunters and the Inuit and First Nations people who lived in the north country, with their homes and sled dogs. Richard donated many of his works to Laval University in 1980. His work is held by museums in Montreal, Qu√©bec and La Malbaie. The Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Baie-Saint-Paul holds some of his work. Richard illustrated the novel Menaud ma√Ætre draveur by F√©lix-Antoine Savard. One of his works showing the Northwest Territories was used by Canada Post in a series of stamps on Canadian Art.

History =Championship tournament= On July 21, 2014, a full year after the start of the promotion, Wrestle-1 announced the creation of its first own title, the Wrestle-1 Championship. Previous Wrestle-1 events had featured matches for championships owned by other promotions like All Star Wrestling (ASW), European Wrestling Promotion (EWP), Pro Wrestling Zero1 and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was announced that the inaugural champion would be determined in a sixteen-man single-elimination tournament taking place between September 21 and October 8. Wrestle-1's founder Keiji Mutoh quickly announced that he would not be taking part in the tournament. The tournament brackets were revealed on August 8, with the exception of two participants, who would be determined in qualifying matches on August 31. In the qualifying matches, Jiro Kuroshio defeated Andy Wu and Daiki Inaba defeated Koji Doi. The tournament featured only wrestlers officially signed to Wrestle-1 and none of the freelancers or outside wrestlers working regularly for the promotion. Pro Wrestling Zero1's reigning World Heavyweight Champion Masakatsu Funaki announced he was looking to defend his title throughout the tournament and unifying it with the Wrestle-1 Championship. However, just before the start of the tournament on September 19, Funaki lost the World Heavyweight Championship. The Wrestle-1 Championship belt was unveiled at a press conference on September 17. The first two rounds of the tournament were held over three shows between September 21 and 23 and saw Kai, Masakatsu Funaki, Masayuki Kono and Shuji Kondo advance to set up the two semifinal matches for October 8.

Esplin represented Clatterbuck in those proceedings, which ultimately resulted in a plea deal, where the death penalty was taken off the table, and Clatterbuck pleaded to two homicide charges resulting in a sentence of 5 to life in the Utah State Prison.

It is sung by the manic Amy, as the thought of marriage sends her into a panic on the day of her wedding. It is often incorrectly called \\"Not Getting Married Today\\". With 68 words sung in a total of 11 seconds, \\"Getting Married Today\\" was notable for being the most difficult musical song with the fastest verse in history. Production \\"Getting Married Today\\" was conceived as \\"Sondheim‚Äôs psychotic notion of a patter song\\" to simulate the sensation of having a mental breakdown through verbal diarrhea and constantly changing the subject mid-sentence. Stephen Sondheim gave a masterclass on some of his songs, including this one, at London's Guildhall School. The song features operatic interludes described by Edge Boston as \\"soprano intermezzos\\", sung by a priest who comically comments on the bride's breakdown and extols the glory of marriage. Lyrical content In her meltdown, Amy discusses the very nature of a wedding, and how it is not relevant to a modern society: > Wedding, what's a wedding? It's a prehistoric ritual where Everybody > promises fidelity forever, which is Maybe the most horrifying word I ever > heard, and which is Followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he'll realize > he's Saddled with a nut and wanna kill me which he should. Covers The song was covered in a Glee episode where Emma Pillsbury starts to second-guess marrying Will Schuester, before fleeing from the wedding. The song was also covered in a performance in the 2019 Broadway Backwards charity event in which Darren Criss sang the role of \\"Amy\\". Critical reception It has been described as \\"one of Sondheim‚Äôs toughest songs\\". Journal Sentinel said the song captures \\"both the crazed humor and darker undertow within this manic bride\\". White Rhino Report wrote \\"Amy's frenetic rant about not being ready for marriage is a rapid-fire patter song. Set off against this insanity is the ironic counterpoint of Jenny's operatic aria about the beauty of a wedding day.\\" Commenting on Stephen Sondheim‚Äôs 'Company' With The New York Philharmonic, The AV Club wrote \\"it‚Äôd be hard for anyone to sing the patter- iffic 'Getting Married Today' as fast as it‚Äôs meant to be, even with months to work on it instead of the short time that Finneran had.\\" Chichester Observer said Amy is a \\"jittery bride-to-be\\" with an \\"epic breakdown and breakneck teeth-rattling delivery\\". The Guardian wrote the show \\"boasts the most astonishing score of any Stephen Sondheim work, and at the same time a book demonstrating an almost complete lack of commitment to coherent narrative\\", adding that the show has a \\"large dollop of irony\\". It continued by saying: \\"The result is numbers, such as 'The Little Things You Do Together' and 'Getting Married Today', that are sheer bliss to listen to, but often unexpectedly disappointing and distancing in performance.\\" References Category:1970 songs Category:Patter songs Category:Songs from musicals Category:Songs written by Stephen Sondheim Category:Songs about marriage ","title":"Getting Married Today (song)"},{"id":"43358181","text":"Victoria D√≠ez Bustos de Molina (11 November 1903 - 12 August 1936) was a Spanish Roman Catholic and a member from the Teresian Association. Molina worked as a teacher who became well-loved among her students for her deep faith and her passion as well as her commitment to the education of children. Molina was beatified on 10 October 1993. Life Victoria D√≠ez Bustos de Molina was born on 11 November 1903 as the sole child to Jos√© D√≠ez Moreno and Victoria Bustos de Molina. Molina became a teacher instead of enlisting in the missions so as to appease her parents. She spent time in Seville while both teaching and preparing for her final examinations and received her master's degree in education in 1923; she studied there since 1919. She was sent to teach in Cheles in 1927 - close to the border of Portugal - before being moved not long after to Hornachuelos on 13 June 1928 to teach there and remained there until 1936. Molina remained there for almost a decade and often came into conflict with the authorities due to her refusal to remain silent about her faith which was well-noted across the area among those she came into contact with. She joined the Teresian Association in 1928 and had a devotion to Teresa of √Åvila and received first exposure to the movement after attending an afternoon conference with some friends on 25 April 1926. The local parish priest Antonio Molina Ariza approved for her to evangelize to the townspeople and offered classes for the adults. She collected clothing and food as well as medicine for poor people and often made clothing for girls. She maintained correspondence with the Mar√≠a Josefa Segovia Mor√≥n. Molina was arrested in the evening on 11 August 1936 as she taught to fellow women and two armed men entered the room demanding that she follow them. She kissed her mother - who was present - and waved farewell to the woman and followed the men out to be taken to a detention center. On 12 August at 2:00am she and seventeen men - Father Molina included who was captured the month prior - were awoken and ordered to walk for three hours and several men collapsed. But she urged them on and said: \\"Take heart! I see the heavens opening. The prize awaits us!\\" and said this in full awareness that death was approaching. Molina was shot at dawn and the bodies of those present fell into an abandoned mineshaft where the group was killed; her final words were: \\"Long live Christ the King!\\" Her remains were later relocated on 11 December 1965. Beatification The beatification process opened on 24 May 1962 in an informative process that later closed not long after sometime in May 1963; she was titled as a Servant of God on 24 May 1962 under Pope John XXIII when the cause started and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 11 March 1988 in Rome. The C.C.S. received the Positio in 1989 and theologians received it and approved it on 16 March 1993 as did the C.C.S. on 1 June 1993. Pope John Paul II confirmed on 6 July 1993 that she was killed in hatred of her faith and later beatified her on 10 October 1993. The current postulator for the cause is Dr. Encarnaci√≥n Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez.

According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he was of Persian origin, and had served originally under Narses, who occupied the post of chief minister (vuzurg framadhƒÅr) of the Sasanian Empire for almost the entire first half of the 5th century. He first appears in the Byzantine court in . At the time he was a servant of the imperial bedchamber (cubicularius), and although young of age enjoyed the favour of emperor Arcadius (). This allowed him to influence imperial policy, and gained him the post of tutor (baioulos) to the young heir to the throne, the future Theodosius II (). The 9th-century chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor reports erroneously that Antiochus came to Constantinople only after Arcadius' death in 408, having been dispatched by the Persian shah Yazdegerd I () to watch over the young Theodosius. It may be, however, that this report reflects the recognition of his position as imperial tutor by Yazdegerd, whom the dying Arcadius had entrusted with ensuring his son's position during his minority. Antiochus was a zealous Christian, and in his correspondence with Yazdegerd succeeded in securing the well-being of Christians in his home country. Antiochus probably exercised his duties as tutor until 414, when Theodosius' sister Pulcheria took over. By , he had risen to the post of praepositus sacri cubiculi, head of the imperial bedchamber, and the exalted rank of patricius. At about that time, he was dismissed from his palace posts by Theodosius, who resented his patronising attitude, probably after the emperor's marriage to Aelia Eudocia. His property was confiscated, and he was forced to retire as a monk to the Church of Saint Euphemia at Chalcedon, where he later died. His palace in Constantinople, adjacent to the Hippodrome, was also confiscated by the emperor.

He was married to Crystle, a fellow socialist from Austria, and he spoke French and German fluently. He was known for excellent oratory in Marathi and English. Of his debates in the Lok Sabha, veteran journalist D. B. Karnik, wrote ‚ÄúOnce he had the floor to himself, he would not miss a single opportunity to put his opponents, particularly the ruling party, in the wrong box. Then quotations would flow, in English, Marathi and Sanskrit. There would be stories and anecdotes. There would be legal arguments and a flourish of emotional outbursts. Above all there would be the beauty of the language coming out with such superb power of expression‚Äù. Achievements * He fought elections, unsuccessfully, for Mumbai State's assembly in 1952 from Belgaum region. * He was elected Member of Parliament for 3 consecutive terms from Rajapur (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1957 Indian general election, 1962 Indian general election & 1967 Indian general election. * He died in January 1971, just before that year's general election. His socialist friend Madhu Dandavate succeeded him as Lok Sabha member from the Rajapur seat. * The Konkan railway was his brainchild.

It consists of eight episodes, each running approximately 23 minutes in length. FX broadcast the fifth season on Thursdays at 10:30 pm in the United States. The season was produced by 3 Arts Entertainment and the executive producers were Louis C.K., Dave Becky and M. Blair Breard. Louie was created, written and directed by Louis C.K., who stars as a fictionalized version of himself, a comedian and divorced father raising his two daughters in New York City. The show has a loose format atypical for television comedy series, consisting of largely unconnected storylines and segments (described as \\"extended vignettes\\") that revolve around Louie's life, punctuated by live stand-up performances. Production Louie was renewed by FX for a fifth season in July 2014 with a seven-episode order. When FX announced the season's premiere date in January 2015, it was announced the season would consist of eight episodes instead of thirteen or fourteen. It was later revealed by Louis C.K. during a panel to promote the show that the shortened season length was due to an unfortunate decision he made while high on marijuana. In January 2015, C.K. spoke about the writing and tone of the season, \\"This season is more laugh-centric and funny than season four. The feeling I was having when I wrote the season...was a goofy and playful feeling.\\" The fifth season features the return of the opening credits and theme song, which were absent in the fourth season. Cast =Main cast= * Louis C.K. as Louie =Recurring cast= =Guest stars=  Episodes  Reception =Critical response= The fifth season of Louie has received acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a rating of 97%, based on 29 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, \\"A renewed focus on the show's singular blend of sincerity and hilarity keep Louie at the top of its game.\\" On Metacritic, the season has a score of 91 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Sonia Saraiya of Salon wrote that \\"Louie is a treasure\\" and that season 5 of the show \\"is as confident and distinctive as ever, a sitcom that is not quite like anything else on television\\". James Poniewozik of Time wrote that season 5 is \\"by and large, blisteringly funny\\" and \\"also poignant\\", stating that \\"Louie has again successfully reinvented itself, this time as what it used to be.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety praised the series and wrote, \\"Almost nothing else on TV ‚Äî certainly in half-hour form ‚Äî rivals the particularity of C.K.'s approach, which has garnered the kind of well-deserved accolades that have kept FX quietly humming that 'Brother Louie' tune.\\" =Accolades= For the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, the series received nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Louis C.K. for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and Pamela Adlon for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. C.K. also received nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for \\"Bobby's House\\" and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for \\"Sleepover\\". For the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards, Louie C.K. was nominated for Best Comedy Actor. For the 68th Directors Guild of America Awards, Louis C.K. was nominated for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Comedy Series for \\"Sleepover\\".
