Each brigade was to have approximately 3,600 officers and enlisted men organized into three regiments and, with three such brigades, each division was to total about 11,000 officers and men. Thus the division was to be about the same size as the division of 1861, but army corps were to be larger. The division staff initially was to have an adjutant general, quartermaster, commissary, surgeon, inspector general and engineer, with an ordnance officer added later. The brigade staff was identical except that no inspector general or ordnance officer was authorized. General Order 46 of May 16, 1898 assigned commanding officers and training camps to the new corps. Major General James F. Wade was named as commander of Third Army Corps, which was to assemble at Camp Thomas, Georgia. Brigadier General Royal T.

It started in 2007 on YouTubeIllinois Times before copyright claims caused Jones to move the series to its own personal site, TheCinemaSnob.com, in August 2009. The series became part of Channel Awesome in January 2010. Jones is one of three creators, the other two being Doug Walker and Larry Bundy Jr., to remain on the site as of April 2018. The series has obtained a large cult following, and has met with a positive reception. A movie adaptation, The Cinema Snob Movie, was made in 2012, directed by frequent Jones collaborator Ryan Mitchelle. A sequel, Another Cinema Snob Movie, was released on July 26, 2019. Summary The series follows the Cinema Snob, a caricature of pretentious film critics, as he reviews obscure exploitation films, religious films, and pornography from the late '60s through the early '90s. Since 2013, however, the Snob has started to review more recent and widely released films alongside older entries, such as the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street series, The Babe Ruth Story, God's Not Dead, and Sex and the City. Some of the films he reviewed are generally considered as the worst films ever made.  History  Brad Jones was inspired to create The Cinema Snob after watching Roger Ebert's review of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. He said that the review \\"made me think of how odd it is in general to see film snobs try to review horror or exploitation films...I'm reviewing these movies the same way a pretentious cinema snob would and I'm trying to give some laughs at the expense of the movies to people like me who really do love exploitation films.\\" Jones based the Snob's appearance and voice on an audience member he saw at a Q&A; panel for George A. Romero, who told Romero how he had interpreted Monkey Shines as a metaphor for evolution and the bond between animal and man. The first episode, a review of Burial Ground: The Nights of Terror, aired on YouTube on June 16, 2007. He ran the show on his channel until he was confronted by a copyright claim from the distributors of Nail Gun Massacre. Then, Jones moved his videos to its own website, TheCinemaSnob.com, in 2009. For this new site, Jones also created several more series, such as Kung Tai Ted, The Big Box, The Bruno Mattei Show, and Brad & Jerrid, and uploaded two of his feature films (Freak Out and Cheap) to the site that same year. \\"So I built up a back log,\\" Jones says, \\"so there would be a lot of content, to where I could apply to That Guy With the Glasses when my site had been up for a few months.\\" Jones managed to rise in popularity when Noah Antwiler promoted his website. Rob Walker accepted Brad's request to join That Guy with the Glasses in January 2010, and premiered Season 2 on Channel Awesome with his review of E.T.: The Porno. Since joining the site, Jones has done many collaborations with fellow members of the site as The Cinema Snob.  Episode format  The series focuses on a pretentious highbrow art critic, the Cinema Snob. He wears an all-black suit, large vintage glasses and no shoes, and sits in a \\"comfortable\\" chair, positioned in the middle of the screen so Snob can talk directly to the audience. In the early days, the setting was in Jones' basement, a couch surrounded by movie posters. Starting with Season 2, Snob moved to a living room with a standard blue chair. When Jones moved to a new home in 2013, the location changed again to the same chair in front of a tan wall, complete with a poster for Caligula (one of Jones's favorite films)INTERVIEW: Brad Jones, a.k.a. The Cinema Snob, Discusses His Channel — Nerds and Beyond and a poster that changes depending on the reviewed film's subject matter or characters. The Cinema Snob often reviews a film by stating how inferior or offensive the film is, and proceeds to complain about the film's production quality, content, and/or plot. He frequently makes pop culture references throughout the review, usually to horror films, TV series, his own films, and films he has already reviewed. Sometimes he will review a film considered as being among the worst ever made while satirizing the critical response the film had upon release, such as the case with Maniac, Mommie Dearest, At Long Last Love or Heaven's Gate and frequently imply that the film did not, in his opinion, deserve the amount of criticism it received. On occasion, he will point out there was something good in a terrible film,An Interview With “Cinema Snob” Brad JonesInnovation & Tech Today such as Michael Chiklis's performance as John Belushi in Wired. Sometimes, the Cinema Snob will say a variation of his catchphrase, \\"I'll stick with real ______ films, like _______, thank you very much.\\"  Reception  Over time, the series has received a cult following. Many people have praised the series for its humor and characters. Melissa Garza of Scared Stiff Reviews said, \\"Jones delivers with quick wit, charm, and humorous, cutting observations. =Reception from review subjects= Several subjects of the films reviewed by the Cinema Snob have responded to their reviews. Gary Cohen, director of Video Violence, appreciated Jones' review of the film. After the Snob's review of Savage Vengeance, the film's director, Don Farmer, commented on the video. Jones says it was \\"basically a plea saying that I was wrong in stating that Porno Holocaust was the worst film ever made, because he made the worst film ever made: Savage Vengeance\\". Double Helix Films posted the Cinema Snob's reviews of the Sleepaway Camp films on their site, stating that \\"[Y]ou might find them hit or miss, but the Snob clearly put a lot of work into these reviews\\".  Copyright issues  A few months after Cinema Snob's review of Grizzly II: The Predator, Jones received an angry letter from Suzanne E. Nagy, one of the film's producers. Jones, reasoning that the film was unfinished and therefore illegal to distribute without permission, took down his review. However, the \\"lost episode\\" has since been leaked onto YouTube.

The Cinema Snob Movie and sequel In 2011, Jones announced that he was writing a movie adaptation of the series to be directed by Ryan Mitchelle. The Cinema Snob Movie is about Craig Golightly, a struggling exploitation writer who, along with director Neil Hall, are trying to get their movie Black Angus made, but they need the correct permits from pretentious film snob Dan Phillips. In order to get the permits, he takes on the guise of Vincent Dawn and infiltrates Phillips' film snob group. While there, he gets involved in a murder mystery and attracts the interest of Phillips' wife Nancy. = Reception = The Cinema Snob Movie was released on DVD on September 27, 2012. It has met with mixed to positive reception from critics, audiences, and the fandom. Stefan Ellison of The Scene Magazine gave the film a B, saying, \\"Joining the ranks of recent fare like Grindhouse and Corman's World, this film is a fun toast to B-movies with the thesis being that while they won't lift the human spirit, you have to admire the filmmakers' chutzpah in putting all they have into them.\\" Luke Owen of Flickering Myth gave it two stars as a film and three stars as a movie. \\"While not a perfect film,\\" Owen wrote, \\"The Cinema Snob Movie is an enjoyable no-budget affair made with a lot of heart and dedication. You can see the progression Jones has made as a writer and Mitchelle as a director. With some more time and a bigger budget, these two could really make a fantastic exploitation film that would rival a lot of the direct-to-DVD trash I'm used to picking up in the cheap section at ASDA.\\" Geno McGahee of Scared Stiff Reviews gave the film a 6.5 out of 10, praising the acting, message, and humor, but criticizing the two-hour length. =Another Cinema Snob Movie= In June 2018, Jones announced on his YouTube channel that a sequel, titled Another Cinema Snob Movie, is in development with Jones and Mitchelle returning as writer and director, respectively. A crowdfunding page on Indiegogo was launched to help raise money for its budget, much like Jones' other film, Jesus, Bro!. It exceeded the target of $50,000. The sequel is about Craig, whose latest film bombs miserably, going on a road trip with Neil and two other people to see Craig's father, Stanley, played by Lloyd Kaufman. Along the way, they encounter clowns in a museum and cannibals. Another Cinema Snob Movie was released on July 26, 2019.

Early life Ingraham \\"Gitz\\" Rice was born in 1891 in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. He earned the nickname \\"Gitz\\" from his brother, due to his odd walking style during his earliest years. Rice studied piano during his childhood. He attended Victoria School, Montreal High School, the Feller Institute, and French Protestant School at Grande Ligne, Quebec before enrolling in the McGill Conservatory in Montreal. Military career Rice enlisted in the army on the exact day Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, beginning as a gunnery officer. He began writing songs during training, mostly jokingly musing on the training procedures. Once deployed, he fought in various battles across Europe. He first wrote about trench life in 1915, at the battle of Neuve Chapelle. Rice organized the first World War I concert party for servicemen in France. Rice joined Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Comedy Company as a piano player from time to time. In an interview with the New York Times, Rice cites one of his clearest war memories as a time when he saved a piano from destruction: > I shall never forget, in one town, stealing a piano out of an old house that > was being shelled. The piano would have been destroyed anyhow. We got a > wagon, put the piano on the wagon, and drove down a road where thousands of > infantry boys were lined along the sides. I couldn't keep my fingers from > the keys, and started to play as we went along. There were shouts, cheers, > and singing, and one English soldier came up to me in all seriousness and > said: 'What is the idea of the celebration? Has peace been declared?' Of > course, I had to answer the negative. Following the Battle of Somme, Rice created a committee to develop concerts to entertain soldiers. He was removed from combat upon being gassed at Vimy Ridge in 1917, and returned to Canada. There he became lieutenant of musical entertainment for soldiers, overseeing the entertainment of approximately 70,000 troops per week. Life after service Having developed a reputation for writing numerous popular war songs, Rice moved to New York City in 1919 to pursue an entertainment career further. He began as a piano accompaniment player, and continued to write. Much of his work was based around emulating his war time experiences and performances, and he often appeared on stage in uniform. He went on to create the successful vaudeville act \\"Gitzy Rice and His North West Mounted Police,\\" which featured performers in Royal Canadian Mounties uniforms. He wrote multiple musicals, although none matched the success of his other work. Rice stopped performing in 1930 in order to enter a public relations career, though he returned to the stage to entertain Canadian troops during World War II. Personal life Rice married silent film actress Ruby Hoffman in 1918. He died in October 1947 after facing bronchial asthma for a number of months.

After the declaration of war, General Order 36 of May 7, 1898 defined the organization of eight \\"army corps,\\" each of which was to consist of three or more divisions of three brigades each. Each brigade was to have approximately 3,600 officers and enlisted men organized into three regiments and, with three such brigades, each division was to total about 11,000 officers and men. Thus the division was to be about the same size as the division of 1861, but army corps were to be larger. The division staff initially was to have an adjutant general, quartermaster, commissary, surgeon, inspector general and engineer, with an ordnance officer added later. The brigade staff was identical except that no inspector general or ordnance officer was authorized. General Order 46 of May 16, 1898 assigned commanding officers and training camps to the army corps; Major General Fitzhugh Lee was named as commander of Seventh Army Corps, which was to assemble at Tampa, Florida. On May 29, the War Department authorized General Lee to move his headquarters to Jacksonville, Florida, where he established Camp Cuba Libre. The corps' First Division (division names were not unique in this era) remained at Tampa and was swapped on June 27 for the First Division of the Fourth Army Corps, under Brigadier General Theodore Schwan, encamped at Miami. On July 4, Schwan was relieved and replaced by Major General J. Warren Keifer; this division was ordered to Jacksonville on July 31. The corps was ordered to move to Savannah, Georgia on October 8 and it embarked for Cuba during December 1898 and January 1899 for occupation duty in Havana Province. During March 1899 the strength of the corps was reduced by over half, from 14,972 officers and men to 5,617; Seventh Army Corps was \\"discontinued\\" on May 1, 1899.

She is Associate Professor of Integrated Media and Chair of the Studio Art Department at Oberlin College.  Art Practice  Julia Christensen's art practice spans photography, video, sound, installation, sculpture, and performance. Christensen's projects explore the intersections of technology, time, change, and memory. Her work has been presented at venues such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Los Angeles, CA), Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, MN), Eyebeam (New York, NY), Ronald Feldman Gallery (New York, NY), Carnegie Museum of Fine Arts (Pittsburgh, PA), 21C Museum/Hotel (Louisville, KY), and the Museum of Contemporary Art (Cleveland, OH). Her work has been shown internationally in India, France, Greece, Croatia, Finland, and beyond. Christensen's practice often consists of long-term research projects, expressed through multidisciplinary artworks. Her project, Big Box Reuse, examined the civic reuse of abandoned Walmart and Kmart stores in the United States; Big Box Reuse manifested as photography, video, installation, and her first book, _Big Box Reuse_ (MIT Press, 2008). Her project, Waiting for a Break, tracked the formation of Lake Erie's ice in real time over the course of extreme winter conditions; the work resulted in a live video kiosk in downtown Cleveland, Ohio (commissioned by LAND studio), and a solo exhibition at SPACES (Cleveland, OH). Another project, Upgrade Available, is about the phenomenon of \\"upgrade culture,\\" and how the perceived need to endlessly upgrade electronics impacts life in the 21st century; this research produced photography, installation, sculpture, and led Christensen to collaborate with scientists at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to design spacecraft mission concepts that prioritize long-term technological stability.  Writing  Julia Christensen is the author of Big Box Reuse, published by MIT Press in 2008, and Upgrade Available, published by Dancing Foxes Press in 2020. Big Box Reuse is a culmination of her multi-year art project documenting the civic reuse of abandoned “big box” stores in the United States. The book presents case studies, through photography and writing by Christensen, of museums, schools, churches and more in renovated Walmart and Kmart buildings. Big Box Reuse was met with wide acclaim, and was reviewed and featured in the New York Review of Books, New York Magazine, Washington Post, New York Times, New York Times Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle, Cleveland Plain Dealer, among other publications. Amazon.com named it one of the Top 10 Art Books of 2008; it won “Best of Category,” General Trade Illustrated Books in the 2009 New England Book Show (sponsored by Bookbuilders of Boston); it was selected as a winner in the Trade Illustrated Category and the Jackets and Covers Category, 2009 Association of American University Presses (AAUP) Book, Journal, and Jacket Show. Upgrade Available documents an ongoing investigation by Christensen into how our relentless \\"upgrade culture\\"—the perceived notion that we need to constantly upgrade our electronics to remain relevant—fundamentally impacts our experience of time. In a personal narrative interspersed with related interdisciplinary artwork and conversations with experts from different fields (other artists, archivists, academics), Christensen takes readers along a path from the international \\"e-waste\\" industry to institutional archives, eventually leading her to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Christensen’s writing has also appeared in Slate, Hyperallergic, Print, Orion, and Cabinet magazines.  Awards and Honors  Christensen is a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship, Creative Capital Fellowship (Emerging Fields, 2013), LACMA Art + Tech Lab Fellowship (2017), Ohio Arts Council Individual Excellence Award (2015), SPACES R&D; Award, and the MacDowell Fellowship (2015). She has received commissions from LAND studio (2017), Turbulence (2007), and New and Performing Arts Inc. (2007). Her work has been supported by artist residencies at the MacDowell Colony, Media Archaeology Lab (University of Colorado, Boulder), Experimental Television Center, and the Wexner Center for the Arts Film/Video Studio.

This program has been seen by over 500,000 students. Minas also created PhilaSamba, a samba school in Philadelphia, in 1987, with the help of the city's Latin American Musicians Association and musician Eugene Rausa. In 2015 Minas 6th studio album 'Symphony in Bossa' was up for four Grammy nominations, including for Best Latin Jazz album of the year. Members Orlando Haddad (born Orlando Haddad Filho on April 19, 1953, in Lavras, Minas Gerais) was the son of a physician and a piano teacher of Lebanese descent. He began playing piano at age six and as a child growing up in Brazil he studied classical piano and guitar. In his hometown of Lavras, Haddad was the leader of the pop-rock band Os Miseráveis (later renamed Electron 6). The group disbanded and with three other high school friends, he formed the group Zin performing mostly British/American as well as popular Brazilian music. Haddad later moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he studied at the Villa-Lôbos Institute and pursued private classical guitar studies. At the height of the military dictatorship, music schools were not well funded in Brazil, so Haddad transferred to the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he received his bachelor's degree in composition in 1979. He later received a Masters of Science in Arts Administration from Drexel University in 1986, and in 2002 a Masters in Composition from Temple University, in Philadelphia. Patricia King Haddad (born Patricia Gale King on April 27, 1956, in Denver, Colorado) grew up in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where she began her music education studying voice and piano, performed in musicals and theatrical productions at age six. In 1974 she enrolled at University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA) where she studied opera and continued piano studies and composition. She holds a master's degree in Jazz Piano Performance from Philadelphia's University of the Arts and a degree in classical voice from UNCSA. In addition to performing, composing and recording works with Minas, King wrote the story, music, and lyrics for her operetta La Giara (The Water Jug) a story about her families emigration from Sicily to Philadelphia. History In 1975, Haddad and King met while attending the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, NC and first began performing as the duo \\"Orlando & Patricia\\" on campus as well as local bars and small concert halls. In 1978, trip to Brazil, Haddad and King met Coquinho, Carlos Roberto Teixeira Alves, the drummer of Os Miseráveis, and Electron 6, bands Orlando played in during his high school years. Alves moved to the US and joined King & Haddad to form a trio which they named Minas, after Haddad and Alves’ home state of Minas Gerais. Soon the trio became a quartet with the addition of bassist Rick Heyman, who was from Paramus, NJ. Minas went on for a couple of years performing until Alves left the group and was replaced by Brazilian Manoel Monteiro, originally from São Paulo. The group worked extensively in the southern states of North and South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and up north in Pennsylvania, until both Rick and Manoel left the group for unknown reasons. Haddad and King continued performing under the name Minas as a duo from then til present time. Haddad and King were married in October 1979 in Lexington, VA. The ceremony was officiated by a long time friend, Rev. Langston Randolph Harrison, a teacher and missionary at Lavras' Instituto Gammon. Now as husband and wife the couple continued performing in North Carolina until 1981. After the birth of their daughter Nicole, they decided to move to Brazil, where they lived near Haddad's family and continued to perform in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Pernambuco at clubs, festivals and universities. Joining a recent movement of independent recording artist and labels started by pianist, bandleader and composer Antonio Adolfo, they released their first vinyl “Num Dia Azul” in 1983, which was part of the first catalog of independent record producers in Rio de Janeiro. After living in Brazil for some time, Haddad and King returned to the United States and settled in the city of Philadelphia where they now live with their two children, daughter Nicole Michele Haddad and son Jordan Alexander King Haddad. Through their musical writings and arrangements as MINAS and its various projects, many jazz musicians in the U.S. and Brazil have collaborated with Haddad and King (MINAS) on recordings and/ or live performances to include: Paul Winter, Herbie Mann, Gerald Veasley, Cyro Baptista, Hendrik Meurkens, Rob Hyman, Djalma Correa, John Swana, Rogerio Boccato, David Finke, Adriano Santos, Adriano Giffoni, João Cortez, Vanderlei Pereira, Cid Teixeira, Andrew Neu, Larry McKenna.

Its lyrics were written by Carol Hirsch and its music composed by Baker and Blink. The song is considered to be part of a larger effort to create support for American efforts during World War I. Composition The composition was published in 1918 by the Metropolitan Music Company, with Carol Hirsch as the lyricist, and Baker and Blink (of the Metropolitan Music Company) composing the score. The piece was arranged for piano and includes a single voice part. The song is upbeat and set to an allegro moderato tempo. Thematically, the song is considered part of American patriotic music. Usage during World War I Although Abraham Lincoln's death was well before the beginning of the twentieth century, he was often used symbolically, particularly during World War I. \\"Abraham Lincoln, what would you do?\\" was a popular composition upon its release, and Lincoln's image was used in the composition's lyrics to promote and build support for American involvement during wartime. Sociologist Barry Schwartz suggests that the lyrics represented American involvement in the war in terms of a collective debt to be paid to Lincoln's contributions and legacy, specifically in the line: \\"Abraham Lincoln, we owe it to you, to protect this great country today\\". This idea of indebtedness is also reflected in the illustration on the cover of the sheet music; Schwartz comments that the United States is portrayed as Columbia, a woman draped in the American Flag with open arms looking up to Lincoln's statue and seeking to follow his example.

It was released nearly seven years after their first, Visible Idea of Perfection, in 2007. Previously, the band was planning to release it in 2012 but had to be postponed because of some reasons. On March 15, the single \\"Let the Right One In\\" was released for free on their website. This album received great receptions from fans and many local music critics. In January 2014, Detourn was named the best album of 2013 by Rolling Stone Indonesia.  Background  Post Visible Idea of Perfection era, they raced around the country’s rock circuit, visiting a variety of places and performing their songs numerous times. But still they were in the process of finishing the album. On an interview, the band promised the new album would be released in mid or late 2012 but later had to be postponed because they ran out of money or/and they had production issues. Also the band was working towards perfection. They won’t release it if they think it was not as good as the materials on the first LP. That helped to explain why the band had taken so long to finish their latest album. If they felt it wasn’t good enough, this album might not have been released for another five years.  Recording & Composition  Detourn was recorded at Massive Studio, Bandung. The album was produced by Rekti Yoewono (vocalist, guitarist) and Farri Icksan (guitarist). The album showed the group's fusion of blues, psychedelic and rock. For fans and the industry, the album was like a thirst-quencher—it was something had been awaiting for a very long time. Retail sales certainly point in that direction. The S.I.G.I.T. offered a fresh approach to their kind of rock music. The production on the album— which was a long process—comes across very well. They did a lot of sound explorations, flowing from one song to another, working on beats and few other things. Probably for some people, it will be quite hard to get this on the first hearing. This album was not as friendly to the ear as the previous one, but this was The S.I.G.I.T. now. And on the musical side, Rekti was given the opportunity to realize his long-held wish to have a flute and Irish whistle in \\"Son of Sam\\"; admittedly, not a common choice of instruments for a rock band.  Released  The band planned to do another release show, just like what they did once when they released Hertz Dyslexia. And with the help from their label, and an event organized, \\"Detournement\\" was held on 26 October 2013, at the same venue as \\"The Dyslexia Concert\\". Renowned for their lavish stage shows, The S.I.G.I.T. set high standards in sound quality, used innovative sound effects, and lightnings. Also, many great local musicians were invited to have appearance. Like choir, backup singers, saxophone player, and many more talents. The preparations for the solo concert was, one could say— absolutely amazing. Proper one for the tenth anniversary of the band's togetherness. Like the concert four years ago, fans from all over the country attended this legendary event. Over three thousand fans came to a venue of five thousand. Many were left wondered because of several bizarre gestures from the personnel. One was as Rekti came out from backstage with eyes of Fatima on the palm of his hands and was in dark cloak. People might have misinterpreted this gimmick as \\"illuminati\\", but that was just his blessing for the fans—so they may be kept away from bad lucks. But though, the show went on clock-wise and was considered successful. The S.I.G.I.T. released 3 version of physical albums, which are LP, CD, and Cassette. They also released the boxset version containing CD, cassette, poster, and alternative cover artworks. On March 15, 2013, the single \\"Let the Right One In\\" was released for free on their website.

Michael Seifert (born February 1969 in Copenhagen) is a Danish computer programmer, inventor,Seifert and Christensen, United States Patent 8,255,526, \\"A method for collecting human experience analytics data\\", August 2012 businessman, and entrepreneur in the IT industry. He is co-developer of DikuMUD, a popular multiplayer text-based role-playing game codebase, and chief executive officer of Sitecore, a global customer experience management software company, which he co-founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. In 2013 Seifert won Denmark's annual IT Prize (IT-Prisen) for lifetime achievement in the field of information technology.  Early life  Seifert was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in February 1969 to Erik J. Thomsen and Kirsten Seifert, who divorced when he was two years old. His great-grandfather was Carl Seifert (d. 1935), a Danish blacksmith and manufacturer who was recorded in the Kraks Blue Book (Kraks Blå Bog) of well-known Danes in 1929. Throughout his childhood and high school years, Seifert resided with his mother and two brothers on the Danish island of Bornholm. From the age of 11, Seifert spent summers and Christmas holidays in San Rafael, California with his father, who immigrated to the United States and founded the microcomputer products firm Sun-Flex Company, which was later sold to Xidex Corporation. There, his father co-invented an anti-glare device for computer terminals, which was awarded United States Patent number 4,253,737 in 1981.Thomsen and Brennan, United States Patent 4,253,737, \\"Anti-Glare device for a computer terminal display tube\\", March 1981 It was during the first summer holiday with his father that Seifert became interested in computers and wrote his first computer program. At age 15, with the help of a friend and his mother, Seifert started his first IT company, Danbyte, which imported computer disks to Bornholm. From 1990 to 1996, Seifert attended the University of Copenhagen, where he received a master of science degree in computer science and an exam.art in human computer interaction. His 135-page university thesis, Evaluation and Implementation of Operating System Support for Multiple Network Interfaces was co-authored with Ole Sas Thrane and published in 1995.DIKU 1995 Yearkbook of Theses PublishedMichael Seifert, Ole Sass Thrane, “Evaluation and Implementation of Operating System Support for Multiple Network Interfaces”, Google Books, 1995 It was at DIKU (Danish: Datalogisk Institut, Københavns Universitet)—the department of computer science at the University of Copenhagen—where Seifert got involved in the DikuMUD project and also met the colleagues with whom he would later found Sitecore.  DikuMUD  In June 1990 at DIKU, Seifert joined Hans Henrik Stærfeldt, Tom Madsen, and Sebastian Hammer (and later Katja Nyboe) to work on the development of DikuMUD, a multiplayer text-based role- playing game, which is a type of MUD. DikuMUD became one of the first multi- user games to become popular as a freely available program for its gameplay and similarity to Dungeons & Dragons. At the time, DikuMUD was only available to university students with Internet access, so Seifert solicited funds from the Tuborg Foundation, run by Danish brewing company Carlsberg Group, in order to purchase modems and hubs to make DikuMUD more widely available to the Danish population at large. Seifert won the funds by putting a special Tuborg- branded drink into the game and awarded points to players who drank it (in the game).Published/living Valhalla source code with Tuborg reference Seifert and the team released the DikuMUD source code in October 1990 and it became the root of one of the largest trees of derived code from a MUD-like source code package. After the last official release of DikuMUD in July 1991, the team moved on to the development of DikuMUD II, which continues to run today under the name of Valhalla MUD.DikuMUD After graduating, Seifert made efforts to commercialize DikuMUD and, later, start an online casino business, neither of which proved fruitful. In 1998, with fellow University of Copenhagen students Thomas Albert, Jakob Christensen, Peter Christensen, and Ole Sas Thrane, Seifert co-founded systems integration company Pentia A/S, from which Sitecore was later spun off as a separate business entity.  Sitecore  Seifert started Pentia in 1998 as a systems integration company focused on Microsoft technologies. As consultants, Seifert and his team were hired to design and implement websites, among other things, for a number of large Danish international corporations. To make their jobs easier, Thrane had devised a set of automated tools and methods for developing and managing websites. At the time, making changes to a website required the expertise of a programmer or developer. The group recognized a growing demand for their website services and decided to turn Thrane’s inventionThrane and Christensen, United States Patent 7,856,345, \\"Method for building and managing a web site\\", December 2010 into a marketable product (that would today be classified as a content management system). In 2001, Seifert and his Pentia co-founders spun off Sitecore as a separate business entity, which initially sold content management systems in the Danish market but has grown profitably into a recognized global provider of customer experience management software with more than 850 employees and competition that includes IBM, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com, and Adobe Systems. Seifert has served as CEO since 2001 and was initially joined by Ole Sas Thrane and Jakob Christensen. Sitecore expanded business into the United States in 2004. Seifert moved to Kentfield, California, United States with his wife and three children in 2013. He works out of the Sitecore USA headquarters in Sausalito, California. In 2014 Seifert was included in the Kraks Blue Book (Kraks Blå Bog).  Awards  Seifert is credited as the co-inventor of a method for collecting human experience analytics data, which was awarded United States Patent number 8,255,526 in August 2012. In 2013, Seifert joined the likes of Skype co-founder Janus Friis and Turbo Pascal author Anders Hejlsberg as a recipient of Denmark’s annual IT Prize (IT-Prisen) for lifetime achievement in the field of information technology.

PreQ1-III riboswitches are a class of riboswitches that bind pre-queuosine1 (PreQ1), a precursor to the modified nucleoside queuosine. PreQ1-III riboswitches are the third class of riboswitches to be discovered that sense this ligand, and are structurally distinct from preQ1-I and preQ1-II riboswitches.

Other examples are Vrbanjci village and Vrbanja, near Banja Luka, as well as Vrbas and a bridge in the center of Sarajevo. Geography The Vrbanja source is on the slopes of Vlašić Mountain, upstream of Pilipovina village (at about 1,530 meters above sea level). The area around the source is called \\"Prelivode\\", with a radius of around 2-3 kilometers. Prelivode is on a ridge between the Vlašić (1933 m) and Meokrnje (1425 m) mountains. The Vrbanja flows through Kruševo Brdo, Šiprage, Obodnik, Vrbanjci, Kotor Varoš, Zabrđe, Čelinac and the settlement of Vrbanja. It joins the Vrbas river in Banja Luka. During the Austro-Hungarian administration of 1878-1914, a wide network of railway communications was built along the Vrbanja, with the support of the Bosnian Government. Exploitation of the natural resources (especially wood and mining) was the primary intended purpose of this investment. The railroad was built along the valley of the Vrbanja from Kotor Varoš to Šiprage, where it branched along a few tributaries of the river. It leads to the area of the Riječice, across the pass between Jasen and Šepirice.Vojnogeografski institut, Ed. (1955): Travnik (List karte 1:100.000, Izohipse na 20 m).

The most significant right-side tributaries are the Bobovica, Lopača, Trnovac, Crkvenica, Kruševica, Jezerka, Bosanka, and Jošavka, and the most significant left-side tributaries, the Čudnić, Ćorkovac, Demićka, Sadika, Grabovička rijeka, Duboka river, Vigošća/Vigošta, Cvrcka and Jakotina.Vojnogeografski institut, Ed.

It deals with the prescription of actions relating to contracts for the international sale of goods due to the passage of time. The Limitation Convention was originally prepared as a chapter of a broader treaty on contracts for international sale of goods. Adopted in 1974, it was amended in 1980 to be fully aligned, especially with respect to scope of application, to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), adopted in the same year.For an introduction to the Limitation Convention see, recently, Luca G. Castellani, An Assessment of the Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods Through Case Law, Villanova Law Review, vol. 58, no. 4 (2013) 645-660, available online at and additional citations there. Adoption As of February 2016, the following states have ratified, acceded to, succeeded to, or participate under the Limitation Convention:The status of signatories to the Limitation Convention is listed at http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1974Convention_status.html, and is updated whenever the UNCITRAL Secretariat is informed of changes in status of the Limitation Convention. The Limitation Convention has been signed, but not yet ratified, acceded to, succeeded to, or participated under, by Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Mongolia, Nicaragua, and the Russian Federation. Substantive provisions What follows is a very summary description of the content of the Limitation Convention, provided for preliminary information only. Readers are encouraged to refer to the explanatory note to that convention prepared by the UNCITRAL secretariat for further introductory information on the Limitation Convention. In its original unamended version, the Limitation Convention applies when both parties have their place of business in contracting States (Article 3(1)). In the amended version, the Limitation Convention applies also when rules of private international law make the law of a Contracting State applicable to the contract of sale (Article 3(1)(b)). Hence, the Limitation Convention, as amended, applies in the same case as the CISG. The reference is to the rules of private international law applicable to the contract itself, and not to limitation matters.See Kazuaki Sono, The Limitation Convention: The Forerunner to Establish UNCITRAL Credibility, at IV.C, available online here. Likewise, other matters relating to scope of application of the Convention, especially in its amended form, are treated similarly as in the CISG. However, article 5 of the Limitation Convention contains an additional list of excluded matters that is not present in the CISG. The limitation period is four years, starting from the date when the claim accrues (Articles 8 and 9). The limitation period stops to run when judicial or arbitral proceedings are commenced (Articles 13 and 14). If the debtor recognizes in writing its debt before the end of the limitation period, a new limitation period runs (Article 20). The limitation period is also extended in case of force majeure (Article 21). In any case, the limitation period expires in ten years from the date on which it commenced (Article 23). The effect of the expiration of the limitation period is that no related claim may be recognized or enforced; however, that claim may be used as a counter-claim to set off, under certain conditions (Article 25). The expiration of the limitation period may be taken into account only if invoked by the parties to the proceedings (Article 24); however, a State may lodge a reservation to Article 24 and therefore allow for the judge to declare the expiration of the limitation period ex officio (Article 36). Practical relevance The Limitation Convention has often been considered as a lesser, and less lucky sister of the CISG. However, it is applied regularly in certain regions of the world, especially Eastern Europe. The Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts database has an increasing collection of decisions relating to the Limitation Convention.Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts (CLOUT) While the USA has been a party to the Limitation Convention for more than two decades, only one recent judicial precedent deals with the Convention.Maxxsonics USA, Inc. v. Fengshun Peiying Electro Acoustic Co., No. 10 C 1174, 2012 WL 962698, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 21, 2012) [CLOUT Case 1186] This is unusual given that, for instance, the Limitation Convention applies to all contracts for sale of goods concluded between parties with place of business in the USA and in Mexico, unless opted out of, and may indicate limited awareness of its existence.

Description Mitrophyllum mitratum showing the papery sheath in which the new pairs of leaves are held before rains. Mitrophyllum clivorum. Mitrophyllum grande. The species generally grow stems, at the top of which two succulent leaves appear. Similar to the closely related genera of Monilaria and Meyerophytum, these leaf-pairs alternate consecutively between two different types of leaf-growth (heterophylly) and during the exceptionally hot summer they remain inactive in a dry sheath. When fused together into a cone-shaped corpuscle, this leaf pair is referred to as the plant's \\"mitre\\", and this is the origin of the genus name. The two separate leaves of the free leaf-pair are rounded-triangular to tongue-shaped. The fused leaf-pair forms a cone-shaped to cylindrical corpuscle, which bears two smaller ear-like anthers at the top. This fused corpuscle dries out in the plant's dormancy period, eventually becoming a papery sheath in which the new (separate) leaf-pair forms. Cultivation In cultivation, the plants are not difficult to grow. However they require deep well-drained sandy soil and sufficient sun exposure. They are also adapted to very dry summers and watering mainly over the winter. Their period of growth is primarily over late autumn and winter. They are slow growing, maturing over many decades, and are difficult to propagate by cuttings; consequently seed is the preferred means of propagation.http://www.succulentguide.com/cactus/?genus=Mitrophyllum Specieshttp://redlist.sanbi.org/genus.php?genus=172 * Mitrophyllum abbreviatum, a slender, low and densely-branched shrub, up to 40 cm tall.

The next instance are the courts of appeal (). The district court handle criminal cases, some civil law disputes and a number of non-contentious matters. There are 48 district courts across Sweden, and the catchment area is based on the geographic boundaries of several municipalities. The number of employees vary, from ten to several hundreds. Types of cases in Örebro The general courts in Sweden deal with criminal and civil cases. Criminal cases are the cases in which someone stands trial under the suspicion of having committed an act defined in the Swedish Penal Code or in another law, for which a sanction is prescribed, like theft or tax offences. Civil cases are cases where two parties are in disagreement, for example, over the contents of a business agreement or cases relating to family law. The district court also handles a number of other non-contentious matters; such as adoption and appointment of legal guardians. Proceedings are generally open to the public, but access can be restricted for example in cases about sexual offences. Organization Sweden is divided into 48 judicial districts (), as prescribed by the government (SFS 1982:996). The district courts are general lower courts and usually courts of first instance. In the district courts, a judge other than the president of a court or a division of a court is simply titled Judge (). A judge who presides over a division is titled Senior Judge (), and the head official of the district court is titled Chief Judge (). Each district court has a Chief Judge, and usually one or more permanent salaried judges (). In order to be accepted for training as a judge one must be a Swedish citizen, hold a degree of bachelor of law at minimum and earned qualifications as a court clerk. in Tureberg There are also more than 5,000 lay judges () linked to the district courts. Lay judges are laymen, not legally qualified representatives of the people, appointed by the municipal assembly, serving four years at a time. The district court make use of lay judges in criminal cases only. Quorum of the court The main rule in civil cases is that the district court should consist of three legally qualified judges, but there are several exceptions to this rule. In simple cases, and if the parties agree to it, the court can consist of one legally qualified judge. Another exception is if the value of the claim is obviously low (not exceeding approximately SEK 22,000 in 2012), then the quorum is also one legally qualified judge. If a judge is excused after the commencement of the main hearing, the remaining two judges constitute a quorum. in Flemingsberg At main hearings in criminal cases the district courts are prescribed to consist of one legally qualified judge and three lay judges. In criminal cases where the penalty is imprisonment, the presence of lay judges is required. However, if a lay judge is unable to attend after a main hearing has commenced, the bench constitutes a quorum with one legally qualified judge and two lay judges. In simpler criminal cases, where the penalty is a fine or where the legislation calls for imprisonment not exceeding six months, a legally qualified judge, without lay judges, constitutes the quorum. Appeal The person who has been convicted, the prosecutor and the victim of the crime can appeal against a district court in the appellate court. This must be made within three weeks of the date of the judgement. In some circumstances a leave to appeal is required, meaning a legally trained person at the court of appeal will examine the case and present a report to three qualified judges, before the case can proceed. If there is reason to believe that the next instance would arrive at a conclusion different from that of the district court, a leave to appeal will be granted. A judgement in a civil case can also similarly be appealed. List and map of general courts The map shows geographic boundaries of the general courts, i.e. the district courts and its appellate court.

The team was sponsored by Zaxby's Chicken Restaurants, co-founded by John Wes' father and team owner Tony Townley, and the team name is likely a reference to the company's home in Athens, Georgia. The team closed down in 2017, and sold its owner points to MDM Motorsports' No. 99 team. History The team debuted in May 2014 in the Nationwide Series (now Xfinity Series) running a partial schedule. In July 2014, the team expanded their operation into the Camping World Truck Series. In September, it was announced that veteran crew chief Mike Ford would join the team as the crew chief for the No. 25 Nationwide Series team, while Mike Beam would stay on as the crew chief of the No. 05 truck.

Silas Seth Weeks (September 8, 1868 – December 1953) was an American composer who played mandolin, violin, banjo and guitar.Oxford African American Center, Weeks, SethHenry T. Sampson, reprint of Banjo World, Vol. 8, No. 73, December, 1900, p. 20, in his book Blacks in Blackface: A Sourcebook on Early Black Musical Shows, Scarecrow Press, Oct 30, 2013, pages 1439-1440. Although he played many instruments he concentrated professionally on the mandolin. He is considered to be the first African American to play mandolin during its golden period and was considered instrumental in bringing the mandolin to the prominent national standing that it had in the early 1900s. He was the first American known to write a mandolin concerto (in 1900) and led a mandolin and guitar orchestra in Tacoma, Washington. Biography Weeks was born in Vermont, Illinois. One of his musical goals was to make the mandolin independent of other instruments, and his playing emphasized the duo style, a way of playing in which the mandolin takes the melody, counter melody and harmonic parts all at once. Properly done, duo style produces what sounds like \\"two or more instruments\\" instead of only one.ARCHIVED TOPIC: \\"Duo Method?\\" Banjo Hangout. A review of his music by Lyon and Healy of Chicago indicated success, saying that he had included harmony with the melody in most of his arrangements. He toured America in \\"circuits\\" performing and teaching, including in public schools in Chicago, Boston, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco. He also performed in New York City, Philadelphia, Providence, Rhode Island, and internationally in Montreal, Canada. He composed and arranged as well, performing his own works on tour. He became prominent enough that he was able to tour Europe (England, France and Russia) and live there periodically. He settled temporarily in Europe, living first in London until World War I, when he returned with his family to New York and played in jazz bands. When he returned to Europe in 1920, he went to France, playing at the Apollo in Paris. His place of death is unknown, but was reported in the January 9, 1954, edition of the New York Amsterdam News, on page 9. He was an admirer of the performances of America's other mandolinists of his day, Samuel Siegel, W. Eugene Page, Valentine Abt, J. W. Marler, W. L. Barney (a Chicago musician in the 1890s through the 1920s), and Fred Lewis. Recordings Weeks made recordings with Edison Records in London and with Berliner Gramophone in Berlin while touring Europe. His recordings are mostly unknown or lost today and are available on compact disk only as part of box set about Black-people who made music in Europe.Rainer Lotz, \\"Black Europe, Some early African- American recording artists outside the United States\\" (presented at the 2011 IAJRC Convention), IAJRC Journal, December 1, 2011.

The concept of the Hyperloop was popularized by Elon Musk, not affiliated with HTT. The project was to develop a high speed, intercity transporter using a low pressure tube train which would reach a top speed of with a yearly capacity of 15 million passengers. HTT's Quintero One HTT also plans to build slower, privatized urban Hyperloops for inter-suburb travel. History = JumpStarter, Inc = The company was founded by JumpStarter, Inc., utilizing the company's crowdfunding and collaboration platform JumpStartFund. The company has assembled a team of community members, attracting high level engineers and contributing corporations including Ansys for computer simulation resources and GloCal Network Corporation and UCLA Architecture & Urban Design for developing the social interface for the Hyperloop project. A December 2014 article in Wired revealed that the initial development work was done by approximately 100 engineers located mostly in the United States. The contributors were working in exchange for stock options, and were selected from a group of about 200 who initially applied. In 2013, HTT partnered with the engineering software developer Ansys, which ran simulation models for the fluid dynamics of the Hyperloop. = Early Routes = The company was not focused on the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco route that was the baseline of the Hyperloop Alpha design from 2013, and considered other routes. , the company was projecting the completion of a technical feasibility study in 2015, but also said that they were at least ten years away from a commercially operating Hyperloop. In 2014, HTT teamed up with UCLA's Suprastudio master's in architecture program, which designed the “human factor” of the HTT user experience, from pods to station architecture to boarding and ticketing. = Employee Growth = By February 2015, the company had grown to nearly 200 people, and had announced that it would hold an initial public offering that year to raise . HTT also entered a formal agreement with GROW Holdings, the developer of Quay Valley, California, to construct a demonstration track beginning in 2016. By November, HTT had grown to just under 500 people. In August 2015, engineering design and construction firm AECOM began providing engineering services to HTT for the design of the full-scale Quay Valley prototype track. Also in August 2015, HTT announced partnerships with international engineering giant Aecom and Oerlikon, the world's oldest vacuum technology .\\" = Early Agreements = In 2016 the CEO, Dirk Ahlborn, announced an agreement with the Slovak government to perform feasibility studies regarding routes connecting Vienna, Austria to Bratislava, Slovakia, and Bratislava to Budapest, Hungary. Total costs for this project are estimated to be . The resulting annual system capacity is projected to be 10 million passengers. HTT announced in March 2016 that they would be using passive Inductrack systems for their titular Hyperloop. In August 2018, however, the agreement expired. In September 2017, HTT signed an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh State Government in India to build a Hyperloop between the cities of Amaravati and Vijaywada. The two-phase project would begin with a 6-month feasibility study which would be followed by actual construction. = Funding = In 2016, HTT had raised $108 million ($31.8 million in cash, $77 million in man hours, services rendered, land rights usage and future in- kind investments).  Test Facility  Test track in Toulouse, France In January 2017, HTT announced that it would be opening a new facility in Toulouse, France. The facility is to be used to host its research. In April 2018, HTT announced that it would begin building the first of two test tracks at its facility there. The company said that the first shipment of tubes has arrived at its R&D; site in Toulouse. The first track, which was about to enter construction, is a ground-level setup running around 320 meters in length. It was thought that the smaller track would be ready for testing at some point that year.

After the declaration of war, General Order 36 of May 7, 1898 approved the organization of eight \\"army corps,\\" each of which was to consist of three or more divisions of three brigades each. Each brigade was to have approximately 3,600 officers and enlisted men organized into three regiments and, with three such brigades, each division was to total about 11,000 officers and men. Thus the division was to be about the same size as the division of 1861, but army corps were to be larger. The division staff initially was to have an adjutant general, quartermaster, commissary, surgeon, inspector general and engineer, with an ordnance officer added later. The brigade staff was identical except that no inspector general or ordnance officer was authorized. General Order 46 of May 16, 1898 assigned commanding officers and training camps to the new corps. Major General John J. Coppinger was named as commander of Fourth Army Corps, which was to assemble at Mobile, Alabama. Instead of seeing combat, the corps spent the summer traveling the railways of Alabama and Florida; on June 2, it began moving to Tampa, Florida and on July 3, the Third Division of the corps (division numbers of this era were not unique) was transferred to Fernandina, Florida. In the meantime, the First Division, under the command of Brigadier General Theodore Schwan, was transferred to Miami on June 20. On June 27, the Fourth and Seventh Army Corps exchanged their First Divisions, the Seventh's having remained in Tampa when the corps headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida. On August 11, with the end of the war in sight, the corps was transferred again, to Huntsville, Alabama. Upon the retirement of General Coppinger, Major General Joseph Wheeler (USV) took command on October 13, and stayed at the head of the corps until December 3.

She attended Hochschule der Bildenden Künste Saar in Saarbrücken, Germany from 1996–2002. She works with photography, sculpture and in multimedia, performance, and installation art. Life and career Ingrid Njeri Mwangi was born in Nairobi in 1975 to a German mother and a Kenyan father. She moved to Germany at the age of 15. Mwangi works and lives in Berlin, Germany with her husband and collaborator Robert Hutter. Mwangi's work is concerned with social conventions and identity. She participated in the 2007 Brooklyn Museum exhibition Global Feminisms. Her 2001 series of photographs, Static Drift, was included. The work makes use of images evoking national and racial identities projected onto her body. Mwangi's 2000 work Neger Don't Call Me features photographs of her face covered with masks made from her dreadlocks. =Mwangi Hutter= In 2005, she and her husband merged their biographies and names to form one artist, Mwangi Hutter. As a creative strategy to resist fixed notions of identity based upon gender, race, and cultural backgrounds, Mwangi Hutter strategically merged names and biographies to become one artist. They consciously use themselves as the sounding board to reflect on changing societal realities, creating an aesthetics of self-knowledge and interrelationship. Mwangi Hutter reflect on the subjects of border-crossing and finding identity, which both can be understood in a political, as well as a very personal, intimate sense. Their works can be seen as a vision of unification and the pacification of contrasts: female-male, African-European, black-white and the borders separating you and me. They have four children.

It has a surface area of 165 acres. The lake is situated on Middle Branch Chillisquaque Creek, which it is named after. Nearby communities include Danville and Washingtonville. The lake has an elevation of above sea level and is up to deep. It has several coves, including Goose Cove, Heron Cove, and Jellyfish Cove. The lake is dammed on its southern side by the Lake Chillisquaque Dam, which is long and high. The metals with the highest concentrations are calcium and iron. Nonmetals such as nitrogen and phosphorus are also found in the lake. It experiences agricultural runoff as well. Lake Chillisquaque is owned by Pennsylvania energy company Talen. It was constructed in 1972 and was originally created to serve as a supply of cooling water for the Montour Power Plant (a purpose which it still serves), but has also come to be used for recreational purposes. Approximately 200 bird species have been observed on or near the lake and more than 50 species of waterfowl pass by the lake during migration. It is also inhabited by numerous species of fish, some of which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Various trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants live in the vicinity of the lake as well. The main recreational activities on or near Lake Chillisquaque include fishing, boating, and hiking. The lake is also surrounded by the Montour Preserve, a nature preserve. Geography Lake Chillisquaque is located on Middle Branch Chillisquaque Creek, in Anthony Township. However, other streams feed into the lake as well. It is north of Danville and north of Washingtonville. The lake can be accessed via Pennsylvania Route 44 and Pennsylvania Route 54. The nearest road is Preserve Road/State Route 1006. The lake has an elevation of . With a surface area of 165 acres, the lake is the largest of 82 bodies of water in Montour County. Lake Chillisquaque is the only reservoir in Montour County. Lake Chillisquaque is surrounded by forested hills and agricultural land. The Muncy Hills are situated to the north of the lake. Large parts of Lake Chillisquaque are fairly shallow. Most of Heron Cove is less than deep and a large area near the lake's boat ramp is approximately deep. The deepest parts of the lake, near the lake's dam, are deep. Lake Chillisquaque has a number of coves, including Heron Cove and the nearby Jellyfish Cove. Goose Cove is another cove on the lake. It is located in the lake's northwestern section. There are numerous other smaller coves and bays. Numerous objects, including tire reefs and cement blocks, have been placed in Lake Chillisquaque to increase its suitability as a fish habitat. There are also basking platforms for turtles on the lake. =Dam= The top of the dam on Lake Chillisquaque Lake Chillisquaque is dammed by an earth-fill dam known as the Lake Chillisquaque Dam. Located on the southern side of the lake, the dam is long and high. The dam is wide at its highest point and the top of the dam forms an access road. The inner part of the dam is a silty clay material, while the outside is made of weathered shale. According to the Montour County Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, a major failure in the Lake Chillisquaque Dam could cause damage to several nearby communities, such as Strawberry Ridge and Washingtonville. It could also result in a decrease in the output of the Montour Power Plant, causing a brownout in the area. A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County. Hydrology The water temperature of Lake Chillisquaque ranges from to in the summer. The specific conductance of the lake ranges from 135 to 202 micro- siemens per centimeter. The lake's pH is between 6.6 and 9.3. It is a dimictic lake. The concentration of suspended solids in Lake Chillisquaque ranges from less than 2 to 58 milligrams per liter. The concentration of water hardness is between 54 and 78 milligrams per liter. It experiences agricultural runoff due to the presence of large tracts of agricultural land near the lake. The concentration of hydrogen ions in the waters of Lake Chillisquaque ranges from 0.00011 to 0.00031 milligrams per liter. The concentration of dissolved oxygen ranges from 0.1 to 10.8 milligrams per liter and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the lake is between 0.1 and 41 milligrams per liter. There are between 3.0 and 5.8 milligrams per liter of organic carbon in the lake. The total concentration of nitrogen in the lake's waters ranges from 0.34 to 3.1 milligrams per liter, while the concentration of ammonia ranges from less than 0.026 to 3.21 milligrams per liter. The phosphorus concentration ranges from 0.015 to 0.172 milligrams per liter. The waters of Lake Chillisquaque also contain varying amounts of metals. These include calcium, whose concentration ranges from 15.6 to 20.9 milligrams per liter and magnesium, whose concentration ranges from 3.7 to 6.2 milligrams per liter. Additionally, the concentration of copper is less than four milligrams per liter and the lead concentration is less than one microgram per liter. The lake's iron concentration ranges from 30 to 13,000 micrograms per liter, its manganese concentration ranges from less than 2 to 4620 micrograms per liter, its zinc concentration ranges from less than 10 to 57 micrograms per liter. The lake's concentration of aluminum ranges from 200 to 1400 micrograms per liter. The light intensity on the surface of Lake Chillisquaque is 1200 micro-moles per square meter. below the surface of the lake, the light intensity is only 100 micro-moles per square meter. At this depth, only light wavelengths between 450 and 700 nanometers are visible, with 550-millimeter wavelengths (green light) being the most common. The Sechhi depth of the lake ranges from to . History and etymology Lake Chillisquaque is named after Middle Branch Chillisquaque Creek, which in turn is derived from a chillisuagi, a Native American word for \\"song of the wild goose\\". It was built in 1972 by the PPL, with the dam having been constructed in 1971. The lake is also owned by this organization. The lake's original purpose was as a secondary supply of cooling water for the Montour Power Plant. Still used as a supply of cooling water in emergencies, it is also used for recreation. As is typical of manmade lakes, however, this use of the lake only started several years after its creation. One person drowned in a boating accident on February 16, 2006, and there was another accidental death in April 2011. Biology =Animals= A total of approximately 200 bird species have been observed on or near Lake Chillisquaque, which has been described as \\"a mecca for migrating birds\\". Numerous species, including more than 50 species of waterfowl pass by the lake during migration in March. These include ducks, geese, swans, and other species. Shorebirds are also common on the lake. The Montour Preserve and the lake are in the Central Susquehanna Wild Pheasant Recovery Area. A sizable population of ringneck pheasants can be found near the lake. Additionally, numerous species of fish are stocked in Lake Chillisquaque by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. These include bullhead catfish, largemouth bass, yellow perch, northern pike, and several other species. A 2005 trapnet survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission showed that the most common fish species in Lake Chillisquaque was the black crappie, of which 717 individuals were observed. These ranged between and long. 290 golden shiners were also observed in the survey, as were 168 bluegills, which ranged between and . 106 walleyes from were also observed. Less common fish species in the lake include yellow perch, of which 83 specimens between and long were observed; pumpkinseeds, 21 of which were observed; northern pikes, 19 of which between and long were observed; and white suckers, 16 of which were observed. Additionally, eight quillback carpsuckers, five largemouth bass, four rock bass, three bluntnose minnows, three common carp, two fathead minnows, and a single green sunfish. An electrofishing survey done by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission on Lake Chillisquaque discovered 54 walleyes from long and 48 largemouth bass from . =Plants= Twelve tree species have been observed near Lake Chillisquaque. These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, shagbark hickory, black tupelo, American basswood, eastern hop- hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake. =Microbes= Various types of cyanobacteria inhabit Lake Chillisquaque. The specific genera that inhabit the lake vary at different times of the year and also at different depths within the lake. Due to the presence of light attenuation in the lake, light plays a role in determining which species of cyanobacteria inhabit it. In September 2009, the most common type of microbe on the surface of Lake Chillisquaque was Oscillatoria, which made up approximately 75 percent of the total. Raphidiopsis was the second most common type, making up approximately 15 percent of the total. In May 2010, approximately 40 percent of the microbes were Navicula and 35 percent were Oscillatoria. Slightly less than 10 percent of the microbes are Anabaena. In July 2010, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus each made up approximately 25 percent of the microbes and between 10 and 15 percent were Anabaena. Slightly less than 60 percent of the microbes under the surface of Lake Chillisquaque were of the genus Oscillatoria in September 2009. Slightly more than 10 percent each of the microbes were of the genera Xylophilus and Verrucomicrobia. In May 2010, slightly less than 40 percent of the microbes in the depths of the lake were of the genus Dolichospermum. The genera Synechococcus, Navicula, and Xylophilus each made up approximately 20 percent of the microbes. In July 2010, nearly 85 percent of the microbes were of the genus Xylophilus and less than 10 percent were of the genus Oscillatoria. Recreation Fishing, including ice fishing, is a common pastime on Lake Chillisquaque. Fishing and boating are permitted on the lake at any time of day, although boats fueled by gasoline are forbidden. Boating of any kind is also forbidden annually between March 15 and April 30 and is also forbidden in Goose Cove year round. The only area for boating access on the lake is on the eastern side of the lake, at the Heron Cove Boat Access Area. The paddling and running stages of the Chilli Challenge triathlon are on Lake Chillisquaque and the Chillisuagi Trail, respectively. Lake Chillisquaque is surrounded by a thousand-acre nature preserve known as the Montour Preserve, which is also owned by the PPL. A 148-acre wildlife refuge is also located near the lake. A pair of hiking trails known as the Chillisuagi Trail and the Ridgefield Point Trail circumnavigate the lake. Their combined length is . The latter trail is not blazed. The Chillisuagi Trail is wide and fairly flat for part of its length, but is hillier near Goose Cove. On the eastern side of the lake, the trail stays close to the shoreline, but it passes through fields, meadows, and forests on the western side. The scenery on Lake Chillisquauque is described as \\"good to very good\\" by Jeff Mitchell in his book Paddling Pennsylvania: Canoeing and Kayaking the Keystone State's Rivers and Lakes. The lake is one of 18 lakes in Pennsylvania with Panfish Enhancement Special Regulations.

Biography Robert O'Dwyer was born to Irish parents in Bristol, England, where he received private musical education and acted as a chorister and assistant organist during the years 1872 to 1891. O'Dwyer's interest in opera manifested itself initially by becoming the conductor of a local amateur opera company in 1889, before he became a conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Society (1891–97) and the Arthur Rousby Opera Company (1892–96), with which he undertook tours throughout the British Isles. After one such tour he settled in Dublin in 1897, where he held various positions as organist in the counties of Dublin and Wicklow. From 1899 he taught music at the Royal University of Ireland and from 1901 conducted the choir of the Gaelic League, for which he wrote numerous arrangements of Irish traditional music. He also wrote articles and concert reviews for The Leader, which became an outlet for his increasingly nationalist views. O'Dwyer completed his major composition, the three-act opera Eithne, in 1909, on the strengths of which he was appointed Professor of Irish Music at University College Dublin (1914–1939). Although he wrote (and published) a number of other works, including a second opera, none of his later works came near the success and significance of Eithne. O'Dwyer died in Dublin.The foregoing is based mainly on Klein (1996) and (2013); see Bibliography. There was also an Obituary in The Irish Times, 7 January 1949. Music O'Dwyer is chiefly notable for having written the opera Eithne (1909), one of the first full- scale operas written entirely in the Irish language. Although Muirgheis (1903) by Thomas O'Brien Butler (1861–1915) was earlier, that work had initially been performed in an English translation, whereas Eithne was performed in Irish. After a small-scale performance in 1909, the first full performance took place at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, on 16 May 1910. A concert performance of the work took place at the National Concert Hall, Dublin, in October 2017 featuring the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra and singers Orla Boylan, Gavan Ring, Robin Tritschler and Eamonn Mulhall. The background to both Muirgheis and Eithne – and other works including Connla of the Golden Hair (1903) by William Harvey Pélissier, The Tinker and the Fairy (1909) by Michele Esposito, and to some extent Diarmuid and Gráinne (1901) by Edward Elgar – is the increasing recourse to Celticism in Irish culture as a means for national identification in the (cultural) struggle for independence. Eithne is one of the best pieces of its kind and would certainly deserve a modern revival. The composer's background in church music led to a number of works in this area, too, including Benediction Music (c.1924) and some works in the Irish-language collection of religious songs, Dánta Dé (1928), of which O'Dwyer was one of the editors. His second opera was a one-act piece called Cleopatra (1929) that was not successful. He also wrote a number of choral works, mostly arrangements of folksongs.

She was born into poverty. The only known account of her early life is her autobiography Tiger Woman, in which May writes that her father left the family when she was very young, leaving her mother to raise four children on the ten shillings a week she earned working long hours. The family had little furniture and no bed, so they slept on bundles of rags at night. May's mother was half French and was described as good-looking, with an olive complexion and dark eyes, features May claimed to have inherited. May described her grandmother, who lived nearby, as a formidable character who influenced May's life. According to May, when the struggle of supporting four children became overwhelming, her mother sent May and her brother to live with their father. It was the first time May had ever seen him. He was an engineer by profession, but was living a life of idleness, drink and violence in a brothel run by his girlfriend in Limehouse. May wrote that she and her brother left the house after her father was arrested by his grandfather, an inspector of police, and later jailed. She first stayed with her paternal grandmother and then with her aunt and uncle on a barge, where she was washed frequently, taught the Lord's Prayer, and had her hair brushed more than she thought necessary but was otherwise ignored. She described herself as a \\"little brown-faced marmoset ... and the only quick thing in this very slow world.\\" Her aunt described her as \\"a regular little savage\\". May earned pennies singing and dancing for sailors on passing vessels. Some time later she was sent to live with another aunt who had a farm in Somerset where May attended the village school. Coster roots, gypsy style In her autobiography, May described her \\"coster\\" (costermonger) roots as being inherited from her grandmother, saying \\"I am a true coster in my flamboyance and my love of colour, in my violence of feeling and its immediate response in speech and action. Even now I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness of it all.\\" May was small, green-eyed, and dressed like a gypsy. She stated in her autobiography that soon after she arrived in London she \\"could only afford one outfit, but every item of it was a different colour. Neither red nor green nor blue nor yellow nor purple was forgotten, for I loved them all equally, and if I was not rich enough to wear them separately ... I would wear them, like Joseph in the Bible, all at once! Colours to me are like children to a loving mother.\\" After she became involved with the London Bohemian set which included Augustus John, who also affected a gypsy style, Anthony Powell said: \\"her hair tied up in a coloured handkerchief, she would not have looked out of place telling fortunes at a fair.\\" Indeed, May's most popular song as an entertainer was \\"The Raggle- Taggle Gypsies\\" which she was said to have performed at Wally's, a subterranean club in Fitzroy Street, while removing her skirt and twirling it in front of her.\\"Bose, Douglas 1915–36\\" in Donaldson, William. (2004) Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics: An A-Z of Roguish Britons Through the Ages. New edition. London: Phoenix, p. 92. She also sang \\"Sigh No More Ladies\\", \\"Bonnie Earl O'Murray\\" and \\"There Lived a Girl in Amsterdam\\". Café Royal set The Café Royal, London (William Orpen, 1912) Around 1910, May travelled to London where she quickly became familiar with the pubs and clubs of the West End. She became a regular at the Endell Street Club and the Café Royal which before World War I was a much different place from the later Café Royal. May described it as a real café with sawdust on the floor, cheap drinks and gilded decorations \\"as gaudy and as bright as possible\\" where you could get a plate of chips for sixpence. May said, \\"The lights, the mirrors, the red plush seats, the eccentrically dressed people, the coffee served in glasses, the pale cloudy absinthe ... [I] felt as if I had strayed by accident into some miraculous Arabian palace\\" continuing \\"No duck ever took to water, no man to drink, as I to the Café Royal\\". She met the painter Augustus John and the sculptor Jacob Epstein. It was Epstein in particular who introduced her to other members of the Bohemian set, which including the \\"Queen of Bohemia\\" Nina Hamnett, prankster Horace de Vere Cole, heiress Nancy Cunard, painter William Orpen, Anna Wickham, Iris Tree and poet Ezra Pound, many of whom May knew. At the Café and other central London venues, penniless models networked for work among London's artists. Those that could, like Betty May, also performed in order to make a living and in many cases women occupied a grey area between professional model and prostitute.Gardiner, Stephen. (1993) Epstein: Artist Against the Establishment. London: Flamingo, p. 74. The lives of many of May's contemporaries ended tragically. Among them were Lilian Shelley, also known as \\"The Bug\\" or \\"The Pocket Edition\\", who later killed herself; the suffragette Laura Grey, who overdosed on veronal in 1914; Sunita Devi who was reported to have been poisoned;\\"Beautiful Indian Model Killed as Spy, Those Who Know Her Say,\\" A. John Kobler Jr., The Daily Pantagraph, 4 November 1932, p. 1. Bobby Channing; and Lilian Browning. Others are identified only by first names or pseudonyms: \\"The Limpet\\", who was always falling in love; Eileen, who modelled for Augustus John and was shot by her lover; and Bunny, who received a six-month sentence for bigamy and was later strangled by a man in Brixton. Other models May knew included Euphemia Lamb (Nina Forrest), wife of the painter Henry Lamb.Euphemia Lamb, 1908. Tate. Retrieved 27 October 2014. Apart from the Café, May sang and danced at the Cabaret Theatre Club, which later became the Cave of the Golden Calf under the ownership of Madame Strindberg and featured frescoes by Epstein.Waddell, Nathan. (2013) \\"Bohemian Retrospects: Ford Madox Ford, Post-War Memory and the Cabaret Theatre Club\\" in According to May, when not entertaining, she was educated in taste by a distinguished older man she christened \\"the Cherub\\", with whom her relationship was strictly platonic. \\"Tiger Woman\\" Le Petit Journal, 14 August 1904 May gave her version of how she came to be known as the \\"Tiger Woman\\" in her 1929 autobiography of the same name. There is no independent confirmation of the story, but according to May, soon after meeting the Cherub, and before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became involved with a criminal known as the White Panther, a member of L'Apache Gang, whom she met in a bar. May wrote that she went with him to Paris and after arriving at the gang's lair was immediately set upon by the Panther's girl Hortense who saw May as a rival. May wrote of the moments after the Panther broke up the fight, \\"I must say that I was in a frightful passion ... when White Panther dragged me by the hair to my feet, In an instant my teeth had met in his wrist ... \\"Tigre\\" he muttered\\" and in this way May claimed to have earned the nickname \\"Tiger Woman\\". Other sources, however, attribute the name to a tiger skin coat or outfit she wore or a party trick that involved crawling on all fours and drinking from a saucer like a cat.\\"Dylan Thomas played cats and dogs with Tiger Woman in The Fitzroy\\", Fitzrovia News, Issue 132, Spring 2014, p. 19. May herself, in the 1934 Crowley libel case, implied that the name had been made up specifically for her 1929 autobiography, Tiger Woman: My Story, saying: \\"I am rather feline in looks. I thought perhaps it was rather a good name for me.\\" Return to London By 1914, May was in London. According to Nina Hamnett, May and Lilian Shelley were the \\"principal supports\\" of the Crab Tree Club on Greek Street founded by Augustus John that year.Hamnett, Nina. (1932) Laughing Torso: Reminiscences of Nina Hamnett. New York: Ray Long & Richard R. Smith, pp. 175–6. The Crab Tree was particularly informal with customers making their own entertainment and helping themselves to food. May recalled that there was a pole from the floor to the ceiling which she often had to scamper up if she had played a trick on someone. May writes in Tiger Woman that she was friendly with a young man called Richard who became ill and died after a canoeing accident while they were out together. She also wrote that she was later engaged to a barrister named Dick and while staying with his family in the country, she went for a stroll with a young farmer who claimed he loved her. According to May, he stumbled, and shot himself fatally in the head when his gun fired accidentally. There is no independent verification of either death however. May wrote in Tiger Woman that she returned to London almost immediately, her engagement to Dick was broken and quickly replaced by a new engagement to a former suitor, Miles L. Atkinson, (1888–1917) who May knew as Bunny. Atkinson was a Cambridge University graduate and university blue who May had met prior to her visit to Paris. They were married at the Marylebone Registry Office in the third quarter of 1914.\\"England & Wales marriages 1837–2008 Transcription\\", Marylebone District, Quarter 3 1914, findmypast.co.uk, 26 September 2014. Cocaine Stewart Gray, activist and hunger marcher According to May, Atkinson was a cocaine user. A trainee doctor at a London hospital, he had access to as much cocaine as he wanted and May quickly began to use the drug herself. She would later comment that \\"I learnt one new thing on my honeymoon – to take drugs.\\" May wrote that on their honeymoon they were thrown out of their hotel when the management became suspicious. On their return to London they became part of the unorthodox household of Stewart Gray (founder of the \\"Back to the Land\\" movement) in Ormonde Terrace, Primrose Hill. The house was occupied by a constantly changing group of artists and models, usually penniless. It was furnished in the most basic way possible in accordance with Gray's philosophy and was without utilities, even water.Epstein, Jacob. (1940) Let There Be Sculpture. New York: Putnam, p. 102. May wrote that she and her husband attended dope parties where \\"all forms of drug-taking used to be indulged in\\". They became part of the circle of Billie Carleton and Ada Song Ping You, a Scotswoman who had married a Chinese man (Song Ping You) from whom she learned to use opium.\\"Drug Traffic in London\\", Daily Express, 14 December 1918, p. 1. After the war, Carleton was found dead, apparently of an overdose, and Ada Song Ping You was sentenced to five months in jail with hard labour for preparing opium for smoking and supplying it to Carleton. Atkinson joined the Army in 1914 following the outbreak of the First World War, originally in the Motor Machine Gun Service.The Roll of Honour. A biographical record of all members of His Majesty's naval and military forces who have fallen in the war Vol. III. London: Standard Art Book Co., 1916, p. 11. According to May, they took a house in Bisley, Surrey while he was training and later May rented a flat in Richmond where she got a job in a shop which she left in a panic after handling Chinese hair-nets which she had read in the newspaper had given a woman leprosy. She moved back to London. According to May, Atkinson demanded a divorce, but died in action in France (1917) before it came through though marriage records appear to show her remarrying at the end of 1916 to a man by the name of Waldron. May's drug use escalated. By her own account, soon she was taking 100 grains of cocaine per day, and morphia too. Her cocaine habit increased to 150 grains, causing her to become paranoid. She recalled that on one occasion a \\"waiter brought me white coffee instead of black. Immediately I concluded that the whole world was against me.\\" Second marriage According to Tiger Woman, sometime midway through the First World War, May met an Australian army major called Roy (probably not his real name) who was in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and they were married at the Henrietta Street registry office. Marriage records show a Betty M. Golding marrying a man by the name of Waldron in St. Martin district, London, during the fourth quarter of 1916.\\"England & Wales marriages 1837–2008 Transcription\\", St. Martin District, London, Quarter 4 1916, findmypast, 30 October 2014. According to May, Roy beat her if he found her using drugs, and on one occasion, returning home to find that she had attended a dope party that had lasted three days and three nights, he \\"took off his Sam Browne belt and gave me the severest beating with it I have ever had\\". She credited the beating as the start to breaking her addiction. Roy was sent to France and according to May they divorced after she found love letters written to Roy by a French girl. It is unclear, however, whether \\"Roy\\" was Waldron and there is no independent verification of May's relationship with Roy or of May's account of their marriage. Harlequin Club Betty May claimed to be the model for The Sphinx, Jacob Kramer, oil on canvas, c. 1919. After the end of the First World War (1918), May sat for Jacob Epstein for the first time at his home in Guilford Street in around 1919 or 1920. The resulting bronze bust with arms crossed was displayed at the Leicester Galleries in 1920. Epstein also completed a bronze head of Betty in 1921.Epstein, 1940, pp. 362-363. It was also at about this time that she sat for Jacob Kramer's The Sphinx which had been commissioned from Kramer by a Bradford manufacturer who had met May at the Harlequin Club and been much taken with her. According to May, the sittings took place at the Harlequin as Kramer was too poor to be able to afford a studio. May wrote that Kramer fell in love with her and they became engaged but were prevented from marrying by Kramer's mother who would not let him marry a non-Jew (although his sister Sarah married the non-Jewish painter William Roberts and Roberts and her mother apparently got on well).Pauline Paucker, Sarah: An Anecdotal Memoir of Sarah Roberts, Wife, Model, Muse and Defender of William Roberts RA (Tenby: The William Roberts Society, 2012), p. 11. The painting was exhibited at the 1924/25 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. The Harlequin Club, at 55 Beak Street, off Regent Street, became a popular haunt of the poorer bohemians around this time. Betty May and her group became regulars. The club was based in the home of Yanni Papani who was also a waiter at the Café Royal. William Roberts remembered in his posthumously published (1990) memoirs the Harlequin's female customers \\"whose vocal talents turned the place at times into a sort of Café Chantant, when the dark-skinned Helene sang the 'Raggle- Taggle Gypsies, O!' or Gypsy Lang sang Casey Jones the engine-driver's lament; with the vivacious Betty May, called the Tiger Woman, together with Dolores and the Snake Charmer (so called from her habit of carrying around a small basket of snakes) joining in the chorus.\\"Roberts, William.

Dope-Darling The cover of Dope-Darling: A Story of Cocaine In 1919, \\"Bunny\\" Garnett, writing as Leda Burke, published a sensational novel titled Dope-Darling: A Story of CocainePublished by T. Werner Laurie, London, 1919. whose central female character \\"Claire\\" was loosely based on Betty May whom he knew well. The plot revolves around an idealistic young man \\"Roy\\" who is taken to a club near Fleet Street frequented by journalists. There he is enraptured by the singer, a sexually experienced young woman who had arrived in London aged sixteen just two years earlier, was duped into taking drugs and then into a life of prostitution. Roy marries Claire and tries to reform her but instead is drawn into drug use himself. Garnett wrote of Claire: > She was always asked to all the parties given in the flashy Bohemian world > in which she moved. No dance, gambling party, or secret doping orgy was > complete without her. Under the effect of cocaine which she took more and > more recklessly, she became inspired by a wild frenzy, and danced like a > Bacchante, drank off a bottle of champagne, and played a thousand wild > antics. The story concludes when Roy and Claire are separated by his military service during the First World War. Claire dies and Roy finds happiness with his childhood sweetheart. Abbey of Thelema In autumn 1922, May travelled to Sicily with her third husband Frederick Charles Loveday (later Raoul Loveday) whom she had married earlier that year in Oxford\\"England & Wales marriages 1837–2008 Transcription\\", findmypast.co.uk, 23 August 2014. and who had become an acolyte of Aleister Crowley. Loveday was aged 20 or 23, had achieved a first in history from the University of Oxford, and had been published as a poet.\\"A Song of Town\\", Raoul Loveday, Oxford Poetry, 1922, 26. They met Nina Hamnett in Paris en route. Hamnett later recalled in Laughing Torso that > he was very good-looking, but looked half dead ... He was very much > intrigued with Crowley's views on magic. He had been very ill the year > before and had had a serious operation. I had heard that the climate at > Cefalu was terrible; heat, mosquitoes, and very bad food. The magical > training I already knew was very arduous. I urged them not to go ... but > they were determined. Raoul Loveday, died 1923 Crowley thought Loveday his \\"magical heir\\" but condemned the marriage, saying that Loveday had committed the \\"fatal folly of marrying a girl whom he had met in a sordid and filthy drinking den in Soho, called the Harlequin, which was frequented by self-styled artists and their female parasites\\".Crowley, Aleister. (1989) The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: An autohagiography. Corrected edition. Edited by John Symonds & Kenneth Grant. London: Arkana, Penguin Books, pp. 904–5. Although Crowley thought the marriage a mistake, he praised May, describing her as a \\"charming child, tender and simple of soul\\" but suffering from the consequences of a childhood accident that had \\"damaged her brain permanently so that its functions were discontinuous\\" and saying that she had not helped matters by taking to cocaine at age 20. Despite this, Crowley admired her for subsequently curing herself of her addiction, which he said she had done by first switching to morphia and then to alcohol. Crowley saw his offer of a job to Loveday as a way out of their precarious existence in London which he described as \\"one filthy room in Fitzroy Street, a foul, frowsty, verminous den ... They were living from hand to mouth, with disaster eternally looming ahead\\". (They also lived for a time in Beak Street, Soho.) May confirmed in testimony at Crowley's 1934 libel trial that she was supporting them both at the time by sitting as a model for £1 per day and that they were living in one furnished back room. Loveday had little money, no profession and many debts to tradesmen from his time at Oxford. Crowley believed the job would rescue Loveday from the \\"vagabonds, squalid and obscene, who constituted the court of Queen Betty.\\" In his Confessions, Crowley described, in typically censorious terms, May at work at the Harlequin Club just before she left for Italy: \\"In a corner was his wife, three parts drunk, on the knees of a dirty-faced loafer, pawed by a swarm of lewd hogs, breathless with lust. She gave herself greedily to their gross and bestial fingerings and was singing in an exquisite voice ... an interminable smutty song, with a ribald chorus in which they all joined\\". Although relations between Crowley and May were always cool, Raoul participated enthusiastically in the magical rituals and studies that Crowley set. May took part only reluctantly in order not to be ejected from the Abbey and separated from Raoul. She did spend some time on her own with Crowley. They sometimes went rock-climbing, which was almost the only time they were on friendly terms. The dilapidated Abbey of Thelema in 2004 According to Tiger Woman, on one occasion May was exploring the Abbey when she came across a chest containing men's ties which were stiff from what she took to be dried blood. She asked Crowley about it and he claimed that they were the ties of Jack the Ripper who had worn a new one before each murder and who he had known and was still alive. Crowley claimed that the Ripper was a surgeon and a magician who had learned to make himself invisible. Crowley also believed that he could make himself invisible through magic.From the archive, 13 April 1934: \\"Black Magic\\" Libel Action. The Guardian, 13 April 2012. Retrieved 29 September 2013. As their stay went on, Raoul's health, never strong, worsened. He suffered a recurrence of malaria and was diagnosed with acute enteritis. According to May, he took part in a ritual in which he killed a cat and drank its blood. He died at the Abbey of Thelema on 16 February 1923, having drunk water from a stream that Crowley had warned about.Kaczynski, pp. 389–90. May testified under oath in 1934 to the truth of the story about the cat\\"Woman's Story of Weird Rites And A Living Sacrifice in The 'Temple' of Mr. Aleister Crowley\\", Daily Express, 13 April 1934, p. 1. but Crowley was equally emphatic that the incident never happened, testifying that \\"There was no cat, no animal, no blood, and no drinking\\". Since their arrival in Sicily, May had been sending reports to the Sunday Express of activities at the Abbey which they had turned into articles. On her returned to England after the death of her husband she sold the rest of her story for an additional £500 and it appeared in the Sunday Express and John Bull. The details were instrumental in further stoking outrage about Crowley's activities, which had been growing since the publication in 1922 of his Diary of a Drug Fiend. Typical headlines about Crowley in John Bull were \\"The King of Depravity\\", \\"A Man we'd Like to Hang\\" and \\"The Wickedest Man in the World\\", the last being the soubriquet that stuck with Crowley for the rest of his life. Princess Waletka According to Tiger Woman, soon after selling her story, May was introduced to \\"Princess Waletka\\" at the Waldorf Hotel. The princess was a Vaudeville \\"mind- reading\\"Eastman Design Collection, *T-VIM 2010-051, The Billy Rose Theatre Division, The New York Public Library., p. iii. Retrieved 23 October 2014. entertainer who adopted the style of a Native American. May wrote that she joined Waletka's British theatrical tour and soon after sailed with her for New York before returning to London. Fourth marriage According to May, after her return to England, she married for the fourth time, a journalist named Carol (probably not his real name). May described him as the assistant editor on a well-known sports paper. May wrote that they moved to live with Carol's mother in the countryside where Carol divided his time between field sports, writing about field sports and talking about them in the local pub. May writes in Tiger Woman, that one day they visited a local rookery which Carol thought overcrowded. He spent hours shooting the birds and May had to break the necks of those that fell to the ground alive. She found the work disgusting. A rook-pie was made which she refused to eat. Soon after, Carol fell ill with a high temperature and vomiting. May left the house after her mother-in-law accused her of poisoning Carol with the meals she had prepared. There is no independent verification, however, of this episode in May's life. By the 1930s, she was again describing herself as divorced. Model and muse Bust of Betty May by Jacob Epstein. May became the model for Augustus John, and the sculptors Jacob Kramer and Jacob Epstein. She was drawn by Gerald Reitlinger and Michael Sevier. She had a rival by the name of Dolores who was also of striking appearance and it was not unusual for there to be friction, and even blows, between the two.Fiber, Sally, & Clive Powell-Williams. (1995) The Fitzroy: The Autobiography of a London Tavern. Lewes: Temple House Books, pp. 27–29. Dolores died of cancer in 1934.\\"Dolores Dead\\", The Daily Mirror, 9 August 1934, p. 2. About July 1928,Fiber & Powell-Williams, 1995, p. 19. May had a brief affair with married Australian writer Jack Lindsay, who was also seeing Elza de Locre.James M. Borg, \\"Lindsay, John (1900–1990)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 4 August 2014. They were together in the Fitzroy Tavern one evening and chanced to see poet Edgell Rickword. Lindsay recalled: \\"I remember going over to Betty, who did not know him, and saying, 'It's Edgell Rickword, the person I most wanted to meet in England'.\\"Lindsay, Jack. (1962) Fanfrolico and After. London: Bodley Head. May soon left Lindsay for Rickword, though the two men became friends. Rickword wrote the poem \\"The Lousy Astrologer's Present to his Sweetheart\\", where the speakers are Rickword and May, which was published in the literary magazine London Aphrodite.\\"Twenty-One Aspects of Edgell Rickword\\" Jack Lindsay, PN Review 9, Vol. 6, No. 1, Sept–Oct 1979.

In 1929 May, Rickword and two friends were arrested on a weekend trip to Dieppe in northern France after discovering that they did not have enough money to pay their hotel bill. They were all deported back to England. The hotel was next door to the local police station.\\"Epstein model in prison.\\" Daily Express, 6 February 1929, p. 1. Poet, translator and cryptic crossword compiler for The Observer (\\"Torquemada\\") Edward Powys Mathers also wrote verse for Betty May, titling one work \\"Oh, That We Two Were Betty Maying\\". In 1928 the Café Royal was renovated and its gilt and mirrors were replaced with a jazz age theme that caused it to lose some of its former atmosphere. By the 1930s, the bohemian crowd who once frequented the Café had largely decamped to North Soho, or Fitzrovia as it was beginning to be called, where they were centered on The Fitzroy, and to a lesser extent The Wheatsheaf in Rathbone Place. Dylan Thomas, a regular at both, wrote to his friend Bert Trick in 1934 that \\"Betty May, is as you probably know, an artist's model – who posed, though that is not perhaps the most correct word, for John, Epstein and the rest of the racketeers\\".FitzGibbon, Constantine. (1965) The Life of Dylan Thomas. London: Dent, p. 174. He told Trick that he planned to write an article in May's name, sell it to the News of the World and then ask her to pay him with her body.Fryer, Jonathan. (2013) Dylan: Nine Lives of Dylan Thomas. New edition. London: Thistle Publishing, p. 71. In 1933, May was living with Hugh Sykes Davis at South Hill Park Gardens in Hampstead, London. The couple entertained Malcolm Lowry and Jan Gabrial there in the autumn that year. Soon after, May and her former lover Edgell Rickword took the couple to \\"Kleinfled's\\" (The Fitzroy Tavern), The Marquis of Granby and The Plough, and finally to Smokey Joe's, \\"a non-alcoholic speakeasy-cum-lesbian pub\\".Gabrial, Jan. (2000) Inside the Volcano: My Life with Malcolm Lowry. London: St Martin's Press, pp. 33 & 36\\\\. Autobiography In 1929, Gerald Duckworth and Company published May's autobiography Tiger Woman: My Story. She promised it would be a frank account of her life but the names of many important characters were changed or missing. The quality of the writing led to suspicions that the book had been ghost-written by one of May's many journalistic and literary friends. During the 1934 Crowley stolen letters trial, May admitted that the book had been written by someone else, based partly on articles she had supplied to the newspapers, though she didn't say who the author was. Challenged about the truth of the book, she testified that \\"My whole early life and my latter life is very true, but there is one little thing that is untrue\\", adding that part of the book was written as \\"padding\\" and was not true. The novelist Anthony Powell, then working for Duckworth, called it a \\"somewhat bizarre work which I was responsible for Duckworth's publishing – not without some trepidation on Balston'sOne of the three owners of Duckworth. part\\".Powell, Anthony. (2001) To Keep the Ball Rolling: The Memoirs of Anthony Powell. Abridged edition. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 161-162\\\\. Powell recalled, \\"For some time she had been anxious to have certain newspaper articles (bestowing the sobriquet 'Tiger-Woman') cobbled into a book. A young journalist with whom she was then living was prepared to take this job on\\". According to Powell, when May asked if Jacob Epstein would allow her to dedicate the book to him, he \\"refused in a cross letter\\". Powell mostly dealt with May's ghostwriter by letter regarding the book but May visited him several times at Duckworth. Powell found that contrary to her tigerish reputation, she was \\"diffident in conversation, articulating with the utmost refinement, [and] always behaved with complete decorum\\". On meeting Powell's publishing colleague A.G. Lewis, who was himself nervous of May, she was terrified. Soon after publication, Aleister Crowley took Powell to lunch and expressed his dissatisfaction with Duckworth for publishing the book. Under British law, however, Crowley would only have been able to sue the Sunday Express, where most of the content was originally serialised in 1923, but too much time had passed.\\"Anthony Powell: A Biographical Sketch of a Friend & Acquaintance of Aleister Crowley\\" by Gerald Edward Cornelius in Newsletter, Anthony Powell Society, No. 26, Spring 2007, pp. 20–23. ISSN 1743-0976 The book was reprinted in 2014 to promote the upcoming musical about May's life, written by Celine Hispiche. Aleister Crowley libel suit Nina Hamnett, here painted by Roger Fry in 1917, was accused of libelling Aleister Crowley. In 1934 Betty May was the principal witness in the suit brought by Aleister Crowley against Nina Hamnett for libel in her book Laughing Torso which had alleged that a child had disappeared at the Abbey. By then, May was Mrs Betty May Sedgwick. May testified to the ritual sacrifice of a cat and that her then husband Raoul Loveday had to kill the cat and drink a cup of its blood. As a result of her evidence, May's character and truthfulness were attacked in a long cross-examination by J.P. Eddy, counsel for the plaintiff.\\"Woman Tells of Her Life in Crowley's Temple\\", Daily Express, 13 April 1934, p. 11. May stated, in response to allegations of drug use, that she had taken cocaine for the first time at 18 but not after 25 and she had not \\"drugged\\" for years. Asked whether the cats in Italy were wild and destructive, May replied that she only knew two and they were both very charming.\\"Jury Stops Aleister Crowley's 'Black Magic' Libel Suit\\", Daily Express, 14 April 1934, p. 11. Under cross-examination, May repeatedly faced accusations from Eddy that her testimony had been bought. He produced letters to May from the defendant's solicitors about the expenses she would receive in connection with the case. May claimed that the letters had been stolen from her with the clear implication that they had been stolen by or for Aleister Crowley. The letters were retained by the court. The case was stopped by the Jury and dismissed by the Judge. Stolen letters In June 1934, Aleister Crowley was arrested in his solicitor's office on suspicion of receiving stolen goods to the value of 7 1/2d. These were the letters belonging to Betty May dealing with the libel case and her book.\\"Mr. Aleister Crowley\\", Daily Express, 22 June 1934, p. 1. At the Old Bailey trial in July that year, May testified that the letters had been stolen from her attaché case by a friend, Captain Eddie Cruze, with whom she had been living at Seymour Street in June the previous year.\\"Charge Of Receiving Letters\\". The Times, 25 July 1934, p. 9. It emerged in evidence that Cruze had sold the letters to Crowley for £5. Cruze's whereabouts were unknown. Crowley was convicted and bound over for two years.\\"Aleister Crowley Bound Over By The Judge\\", The Daily Express, 26 July 1934, p. 7. During the cross-examination, counsel for Crowley tried to impugn May's character, asking her if she thought it fraudulent to publish Tiger Woman as her own work when she now admitted that she was not the author. May replied that she had not thought about it. She said that part of the work was written from articles she had provided to the newspapers and it was partly true, but when pressed admitted that much of it was fabrication. Around the same time, a popular newspaper printed a photograph with the caption \\"Miss Nina Hamnett, the artist and author of Laughing Torso, takes a walk in the Park with a friend\\". The picture, however, showed Betty May. Both May and Hamnett were able to extract £25 from the newspaper within hours of each other on the grounds that both had been libelled. A party at the Fitzroy, funded by the windfall, lasted all day. Murder of Douglas Bose In 1936, Douglas Bose (born 1915), a writer and practitioner of black magic was murdered by book- reviewer Douglas Burton (aged 30). Bose had been living with Sylvia Williams (known as Sylvia Gough), a diamond heiress and former dancer who had appeared in The Ziegfeld Follies in New York. Now in London, she had modelled for and become the lover of Augustus John. At Burton's trial, Williams explained that she and Bose had had a stormy relationship and he once gave her a black eye. All three of them, Bose, Burton and Williams, were present at a dinner party in February 1936 at a studio in Canonbury when Burton had said that it was a mistake to give a woman a black eye. Sometime later, after dinner, Burton launched an attack on Bose with a sculptor's hammer or mallet he had picked up. Bose subsequently died from his injuries.\\"Two Brothers Loved The Same Woman\\" in The Daily Express, 29 April 1936, p. 7.\\"Studio Party of Death\\" in The Daily Mirror, 29 April 1936, p. 9. From other witnesses it emerged that Burton believed he would marry Betty May but that he had been very agitated when she did not keep an appointment that he believed they had. A letter was read in court from December 1935 in which Burton said \\"About the only thing that will evoke the female in woman is murder, bullets, knives. Betty has disappeared. Meanwhile I love her. If we were living together, I should kill her at the end of a few days\\". Another letter read: \\"My life has become an almost continuous ecstasy. The reason for all this – I am going to marry Betty. She might laugh me to scorn if she heard that proclaimed, but I should have the love of a panther.\\" Further evidence was given of Burton's disordered mental state over a length of time and of relations which he and his twin brother both had with a Belgian woman they had met on ship as they travelled to Britain. Betty May did not give evidence at the trial. Burton was found guilty of murder but insane and ordered to be detained \\"during the King's pleasure\\".\\"Twins Meet at Cell After Murder Trial\\" in The Daily Express, 1 May 1936, p. 7. Later life Little is known of Betty May's life after the mid 1930s but in 1955 a notice was placed in a London newspaper by her publishers, Duckworth, seeking information about her: \\"TIGER WOMAN – Will \\"BETTY MAY\\" or anyone who knows her whereabouts since 1934 communicate by letter with her publishers...\\"\\"'Tiger Woman' Betty sought again after twenty years\\" Daily Express, 12 February 1955, p. 3. Just two days later, the Daily Express published a story saying that Betty May had been \\"found\\". The Express reported that she was living in a \\"semi-basement bed-sitter in Luton Road, Chatham\\" and that \\"After she disappeared from London she 'went north.' she said. Then for three years after the war she camped out in a beauty spot. After that to her bed-sitter in Chatham\\"\\"'Vanished' Tiger Woman is found\\" Daily Express, 14 February 1955, p. 3.

It was founded in 2005 after being split from Elektroprivreda Srbije and it is specialized in the transmission of electrical power. It is a member of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity. History On 1 July 2005, the electric power transmission division of Elektroprivreda Srbije was split from the company and established its own public enterprise subsidiary Elektromreža Srbije (EMS). In November 2016, Elektromreža Srbije changed its legal form to joint-stock company with 100% of shares being owned by the Government of Serbia. In March 2018, the European electricity transmission association ENTSO-E warned over delay of electric clocks throughout Europe's power network due to lower frequency which was caused by the loss of electricity in the network. Namely, the loss was created due to political dispute between Serbia and Kosovo where the Kosovar power transmission company KOSTT took 113 GWh unauthorizedly from the network in the period of January–February 2018. Elektromreža Srbije has legal jurisdiction over Kosovar electricity transmission network, but due to political dispute, does not exercise full control over it. The direct loss of 113 GWh would amount to 24.86 million euros, as per average euro area electricity price (per KWh) of 22 eurocents for households in 2017. Market and financial data As of 2017, EMS posted a profit of 25.51 million euros and had 208.45 million euros of revenues.

Whilst playing collegiately for Siena, he led the NCAA Division I in assists during his senior season (2009–10).  High school career  Moore attended Plymouth- Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. In his senior season, Moore averaged 17 points, 8 assists, and 2 steals, which earned him an All-Southern Pennsylvania Third Team selection by The Philadelphia Inquirer. His height, culminating at , and his weight, less than , reportedly deterred major colleges from recruiting him, with offers solely from mid-majors. In December 2005, his Plymouth Whitemarsh coach contacted Siena – an NCAA Division I college in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) - head coach Fran McCaffery to talk up Moore. McCaffery, who thought Moore was already recruited, came down to watch him play (with Moore collecting 15 assists in that game) and sent him a scholarship offer soon after.  College career  Moore debuted against Stanford on 11 November 2006, posting 10 points, 3 assists, and 3 steals off the bench. He started 27 games over his freshman season, leading the Saints in minutes (31.2 minutes) and assists (4.9, third-best in the MAAC), adding 7.4 points and 3.5 rebounds per game. He posted a MAAC-third best 5.3 assists per game in his sophomore season, adding 4.1 rebounds and 1.5 steals in nearly 32 minutes per game. Moore contributed 11 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists in the NCAA Tournament upset of Vanderbilt. He led the MAAC in assists for his junior year, with 6.4 per game (twelfth best nationally) on his way to Second Team All-MAAC and All-MAAC Tournament Team selections. Two three-pointers in the NCAA Tournament game against Ohio State, the first to tie the game in a first overtime and the second to win the game with 3.9 seconds left, allowed Siena to progress to the Second Round. He proceeded to have \\"one of the best 1-for-10 shooting performances\\", posting 10 assists for 2 turnovers as he evaded Louisville's press, though that was not enough to topple the No. 1-seed. As a senior in 2009–2010, Moore was a First-team All-MAAC selection. He had 9 points and 6 assists against Fairfield in the MAAC Tournament final to help Siena win the tournament for the third consecutive year. Moore led the entire NCAA Division I in assists during the season with 261 assists (7.7 per game), he finished his career with an MAAC record 823 that also ranked 23rd all-time best in the Division I. Professional career Going undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft, Moore signed his first professional contract for Slovak Extraliga side Edymax SPU Nitra over the summer, averaging 17 points and 7 assists during the 2010–11 season. The next season saw Moore move to PGE Turów Zgorzelec of the Polish Basketball League. He had 7.2 points and 4.4 assists a little more than 22 minutes per game in the Polish league, complemented by 9.8 points and 5.2 assists in nearly 26 minutes in Europe's second-tier Eurocup. In September 2012, the American moved to Alba Fehérvár of the Hungarian NB I/A, helping the side win the league and cup with 11.5 points, 6.3 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game. On 2 July 2013, he signed with Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague outfit Cherkaski Mavpy. However, he left the team in February 2014 due to the unrest in the country. He joined Italian Serie A side Pasta Reggia Caserta on 25 February 2014 to finish the season. During the summer, his contract was renewed for the 2014–15 season. On 10 August 2015, Moore signed with fellow Serie A side Giorgio Tesi Group Pistoia. On June 26, 2018, Moore left Pistoia after 3 years and signed a deal with Pallacanestro Varese. On July 30, 2019, he has signed with Élan Béarnais of the French LNB Pro A. He averaged 9.5 points, 3 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game. On August 2, 2020, Moore has signed for Cibona of the ABA League.  Personal  Three members of Moore's family have also been involved in the sport at a high level. His uncle, Jimmie Baker, played in the ABA. His older brother, Chuck Moore, played college basketball for Vanderbilt and his cousin, Moore's cousin, John Salmons, played in the NBA.

In 2013, investigators had hoped that a new reconstruction of the victim might uncover more leads. In August 2018, Joseph Wayne Burnette was indicted for her murder, following a confession, stating her name may have been \\"Ashley.\\" The victim's case was later submitted to the DNA Doe Project, who made an identification in January 2019, 12 years later. While she remained unidentified, she was known by the nickname \\"Lavender Doe.\\" Discovery The body of a white or possibly Middle Eastern female between 17 and 25 years old was found on October 29, 2006 in Kilgore, Texas, lying face- down on a pile of burning brush. The body was severely burnt, but clothing including a purple sweater and a pair of jeans was recovered. It is believed the body was set on fire merely minutes before it was discovered. A total of forty dollars was found in her pockets. It is believed she died between 8:15 PM and 10:00 PM on the previous day. Two of her deciduous teeth were still present and were expected to be of help in determining her identity. She had perfect teeth without cavities or fillings. She weighed approximately 100 to 120 pounds, was between 5 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 5 inches tall and was most likely from a middle-class household. The victim's hair color was likely reddish or blond with blond or red highlights, but may have been entirely strawberry-blonde or light brown. Initially, she was believed to have been as young as 13, and race and sex were considered unknown until further study. Due to the recovery of an empty gasoline can from the scene and the nature of her death, the case was investigated as a homicide. Semen was found upon forensic examination, indicating that she may have been a victim of rape prior to death. Investigation 2014 NCMEC reconstruction According to residents of the area, there were many \\"suspicious people\\" in the vicinity of the oil field where the body was discovered and some referred to the location as a \\"killing ground.\\" Because of the condition of the body, the face was reconstructed three times—with clay, in a sketch by a forensic artist, and in January 2014, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released a digital composite image produced from a CT scan after the remains were exhumed on October 2, 2013. Despite comparison with the dental records and DNA of a large number of missing persons, the search for her identity long remained fruitless. After the release of the most recent reconstruction, the mother of missing 23-year-old Brandi Wells, who disappeared after going out to a nightclub in Longview, Texas in August 2006, contacted authorities, feeling the composite strongly resembled her daughter. DNA testing eliminated the possibility that the unidentified body could be Brandi Wells. In 2007, a suspect in the case emerged, Joseph Wayne Burnette, then 36, who is a convicted sex offender and was in prison for another crime at the time police announced their suspicions that he was the murderer. Burnette previously denied involvement in the murder; however, on August 27, 2018, he confessed to the killing of Lavender Doe, along with the 2018 murder of Felisha Pearson. Burnette claimed he convinced the victim to enter his vehicle when she was selling items from a magazine. After Dodd's body remained unidentified, it was buried in Longview, Texas. In 2013, an exhumation took place in order to create the digital three-dimensional forensic facial reconstruction by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to provide an estimation of her appearance during life, as the state of her body upon discovery prevented visual identification. A three-dimensional clay reconstruction and a sketch had previously been created. Aftermath In 2018, the DNA Doe Project took on the case to try to uncover Lavender Doe's identity. The organization raised $1,400 to analyze her DNA profile for genealogy research and estimate her ethnicity. They found Lavender Doe had Czech ancestry and identified a first cousin once removed who lived in East Texas 30 miles from where the body was found. In January 2019, the DNA Doe Project, in collaboration with the Aerodyne and Full Genomes Corporation team, announced they had identified Lavender Doe and that her identity would be released after Burnette's trial. Despite this, her identity was released on February 11, 2019. Her mother had left her when she was a baby and died in 2006; her father was homeless. She lived for a time with her stepmother and was last known to reside in Jacksonville, Florida, where she had lived with her half siblings. Dodd left her family in Florida in 2000, but was reportedly last seen in 2003. She had joined a door-to-door magazine-sales team known for human trafficking with the ruse of travel opportunities. It is speculated by authorities Dodd may have been selected by Burnette as a victim as she solicited customers in the parking lot of a Walmart in the area. It was decided to leave Dodd's body where it was originally buried, as members of the police community spent years visiting and caring for the gravesite.

Route description FM 548 begins at an intersection with FM 740 just south of Forney. FM 548 travels northeast for about before intersecting FM 741, near Forney High School. At the intersection with FM 1641, FM 548 runs in a more north–south direction, intersecting with FM 688 and US Highway 80 (US 80). The highway turns back to the northeast at Marketplace Drive, the location of a major shopping center in the town. Leaving Forney, FM 548 travels by many subdivisions before taking a more rural route. Entering Rockwall County, the highway enters the town of McLendon-Chisholm. In the community, FM 548 shares a short overlap with State Highway 205 (SH 205). Exiting the town, the highway continues to run in a northeast direction, before making a nearly 90-degree turn to the northwest. Just south of the intersection with SH 276, FM 548 turns to the north, entering Royse City a few miles to the north. The highway intersects with Interstate 30 (I-30) before ending at SH 66 in downtown. History The first section of FM 548 ran from SH 205 near McLendon-Chisholm to US 67 (now SH 66) in downtown Royse City; this section was designated on July 9, 1945. On November 4, 1955, the section from FM 1142 west to then-FM 551 was transferred to FM 1143 (which became part of SH 276 on November 26, 1969) and the section from FM 550 to SH 205 was transferred to FM 550. FM 548 was rerouted over FM 1142 (which was cancelled as a result) from FM 1143 to SH 205. On May 2, 1962, the highway was extended further south to I-20 (now US 80) in Forney, replacing FM 2081. On January 26, 1986, the highway rerouted north of I-20. The routing between FM 740 and US 80 was transferred back to Kaufman County and the city of Forney. On October 29, 1998, FM 548 was extended southwest to FM 740 near the new route of I-20.

SBFC is practiced by a wide variety of mental health professionals, including: psychologists, social workers, school counselors, psychiatrists, and marriage and family therapists, as well as special education teachers. What they all share in common is the belief that children who are struggling in school can be best helped by interventions that link family and school. SBFC is typically practiced at the school site, but may be based in a community mental health agency that works in close collaboration with schools. The Need for SBFC Family problems, such as marital discord, divorce, financial difficulties, child abuse and neglect, life-threatening illness, sibling in a gang, and poor parenting skills are associated with a wide variety of children's problems, e.g. delinquency, depression, suicide attempts, and substance abuse. These family problems can have a negative effect on children's learning and school behavior. However, there is research showing that healthy families that cope effectively with their problems help children succeed at school. Traditionally trained school counselors and school psychologists may lack the family counseling training necessary to help students who are experiencing problems at home. If school personnel recommend that a parent seek counseling from a community agency for family problems, the parent and family may not go because of the stigma associated with therapy or because of restrictions imposed by managed care. SBFC reduces the stigma associated with therapy by emphasizing that counseling for family members has an educational goal: helping the student to succeed at school. Parents, guardians, and family members are approached as partners with the SBFC professional, all working together to promote school success. The SBFC professional is an advocate for the child, the family, and the school. Some of the problems SBFC approaches have been used to address are:bullying and cyber-bullying, depression, marital problems, school violence, grief and loss, trauma, life-threatening illness, school crises, learning disorders, immigrant families, suicide, and school suspension. Some examples of large SBFC programs are: \\"The Copper River Project\\" in Copper River District Alaskan schools; and \\"Place2Be\\" - a SBFC program based in over 200 British schools. Origins The earliest pioneer of SBFC was Alfred Adler, the Austrian psychiatrist who developed 30 guidance clinics attached to schools in Vienna in the 1920s. Through these guidance clinics Adler and his colleagues counseled parents and teachers (often both together in large meetings where both groups were present) on how to help children overcome problems at home and school. This Adlerian home-school approach to counseling was strength-based with its emphasis on helping children develop Social Interest. Later Developments With the advent of World War II, the Vienna guidance clinics closed. The psychiatrist Rudolf Dreikurs, who worked with Adler, emigrated to the USA in the 1930s and popularized the Adlerian approach to home-school intervention through books like: Children the Challenge (for parents), Maintaining Sanity in the Classroom (for teachers), and Discipline Without Tears (for parents and teachers). In the USA, during the 1950s, 60's, and 70's the mental health professions developed somewhat independently of each other with the result that children having difficulty at school would typically be seen by a school counselor or school psychologist. Children having difficulty at home would typically be seen by a community-based mental health professional. Beginning in the 1970s the mental health literature begins to show an increasing emphasis on linking home and school interventions. By 2000 there existed a substantial literature on the integration of family and school counseling approaches. Strengths of SBFC SBFC is a strength-based approach to counseling that emphasizes working with parents and guardians as partners. It emphasizes integrating intervention (remedial) and prevention approaches at school and in the family. This emphasis on working collaboratively with parents and guardians in order to help their children succeed in school is appealing to families because of its educational focus. It allows for counselors to hold interventions with students to connect school preparation with future career options is critical for the ever-developing technological work economy. SBFC is also a culturally sensitive counseling approach because it reduces the stigma associated with the mental health professions. This approach is practiced by many different mental health professionals and educators. Evidence-based Support for SBFC Evidence-based support for the effectiveness of SBFC comes from numerous randomized control group studies employing combined school and family interventions. This research indicates positive effects at post and follow up tests for problem behaviors at home and at school, and also for Latino, African American,Native American, and Thai children and families as well. The challenges of working with low income families are well known in the mental health literature. . However, SBFC programs such as the Center for Child & Family Development SBFC program , the Families and Schools Together (Fast) program, and the Linking the Interests of Families and Teachers (LIFT) program were designed precisely to engage these families. There are several randomized control group studies demonstrating the effectiveness of SBFC with low income families. SBFC Challenges and Solutions in Low-Income Communities The SBFC approach focuses on reducing family and school problems (such as school violence, trauma, and other challenges experienced by immigrants and low-income families) and increasing family and school resources in order to strengthen child well-being. An important part of SBFC is eliciting the support of the family. This section describes common challenges experienced by school mental health professionals when working with low income communities and how SBFC is designed to address these challenges. = Challenge: Developing Parent Support = SBFC requires family members' participation. This can be a challenge for those students whose family members are not available to go to workshops and trainings either because they cannot take time out of work or because they do not support or relate to the principles of the SBFC approach. Students seeking counseling to navigate difficulties of the immigrant family experience often have family members who work long hours and cannot give time to the trainings of the SBFC method of counseling. Immigrant families rarely have the time, or the language literacy, to help their children navigate school institutions which can create a disconnect between school counseling programs and immigrant households. The processes of acculturation and assimilation are slow and delicate; their complications extend to a lack of understanding of the Western practice of multicultural progressive school counseling. People in immigrant households may have different traumas and experiences that make them feel lost, depressed, stuck with regard to life choices, and alienated from all formal institutions of mainstream society, including schools. School counseling is often stigmatized by immigrant families because school counselors often approach immigrant students with English-only career tests and one-size-fits- all resource guides.Rowland, Karen D.; Davis, Terah (2014/11/00). \\"Counseling Immigrant Students in the Schools\\". Georgia School Counselors Association Journal. 21 (1) Immigrants students are often subject to ethnic stereotypes by school counselors; for example, Hispanics are considered physical laborers and not scholars and Asian immigrant students are held to higher academic standards and considered intelligentRowland, Karen D.; Davis, Terah (2014/11/00). \\"Counseling Immigrant Students in the Schools\\". Georgia School Counselors Association Journal. 21 (1) Common ethnic stereotypes assumed by school counselors undermine the intended impact of the SBFC approach.Rowland, Karen D.; Davis, Terah (2014/11/00). \\"Counseling Immigrant Students in the Schools\\". Georgia School Counselors Association Journal. 21 (1) SBFC Solutions SBFC addresses these challenges in a number of ways. First, school transformation is a fundamental SBFC premise. Schools must change to accommodate the needs of parents and families and to avoid marginalization of immigrant and low-income parents Strickland, 2020). A common SBFC approach to involve parent is for the SBFC practitioner to have flexible hours that (for example) would permit the SBFC practitioner to work from 12-8 pm on a weekday and work every second Saturday. Further, many SBFC practitioners trained in working with families understand the need to address barriers. This may result in the SBFC practitioner visiting the family in the home to establish a relationship, explore barriers, and make a plan that works for moving forward based on the family’s needs. This SBFC flexibility makes it easier for working parents to meet with the SBFC practitioner. In situations where it is impossible for the parents to meet with the SBFC practitioner, the SBFC practitioner will reach out to the parents using the phone, the internet (email and Zoom), and sending letters. Research on immigrant parents shows that they value schools reaching out to them if it is done in a respectful and culturally sensitive manner. Second, it is a hallmark of the SBFC approach to treat the parents/guardians with respect and as equal partners with the SBFC practitioner. (G&S;, 2020, p.6). The family is viewed as a source of strength for children and that even in dysfunctional families there are family members willing to advocate for the educational success of a child. Assessing family strengths is basic to the SBFC approach. Third, the parents/guardians are approached – not for therapy – but for consultation on how to help their child succeed at school. This educational approach, rather than a therapy approach, is very appealing to immigrant and low-income families who may not regard therapy as a solution and who are not comfortable with traditional Eurocentric approaches to therapy that emphasize individualism and assertiveness. Schools have a long history of marginalizing immigrant and low income parents, but approaches like SBFC that emphasize respect, caring, cultural humility, and reaching out to parents, can increase parent involvement in schools. School personnel trained in SBFC may be in the best position to implement SBFC because the focus in a school setting is on improving student functioning for success as opposed to addressing mental health issues which is frequently stigmatized in immigrant communities. Most parents are willing to attend counseling sessions at a school versus attending family therapy at a community health clinic. Fourth, multicultural competence is an essential part of the SBFC approach. Gerrard, 2020, pp.51-59). For example, when working with Latino/a immigrant families, SBFC practitioners understand the role of familia and educacion: that the valuing of family and education is a core part of the culture and that parent involvement may be expressed by home-support rather than school visits. Parent home-support for children’s academic performance and well-being includes: support for doing homework, having a quiet place to study, emphasizing respect for teachers, discussing future plans, and excusing chores so that more time can be spent on homework.  Challenge:School violence  School violence is often a response to a lack of present family members which can be correlated with an economy demanding extremely long work hours for low-income household survival. Low-income families that are constantly working can be less active participants in their children's schools and upbringing. Studies note that many low-income communities lack mentors who can stress the value of schooling, which in turn correlates to student disengagement and an increase in acting out and violent behavior. Lack of engagement among community members can translate to a lack of parent involvement in schooling institutions which can impede the counselor-teacher partnership the SBFC approach urges. Low-income communities' high numbers of population turnover rates, lack of strong well-funded institutions, and displacement of people from their neighborhoods not only increases school violence among students, but can also create a disconnection between households and local institutions. Students in low-income communities with high crime rates are more prone to commit violence in their local schooling institutions which can promote fear into many students yet students in general are prone to stay silent when approached by school administration to speak about this issue.Rawles, P. D. (2010). The link between poverty, the proliferation of violence and the development of traumatic stress among urban youth in the United States to school violence: A trauma informed, social justice approach to school violence. In Forum on Public Policy Online (Vol. 2010, No. 4). Oxford Round Table. New York: The New Press.Guerra, Nancy G.; Huesmann, L. Rowell; Spindler, Anja (2003). \\"Community Violence Exposure, Social Cognition, and Aggression Among Urban Elementary School Children\\". Child Development. 74 (5): 1561–1576. doi:10.1111/1467-8624.00623. ISSN 1467-8624. Violence in schooling institutions is often normalized by parents due to constant violence in their communities which then disrupts possible connections between counselors and parents. The high rates of school violence within low-income urban schools can lead to traumatic stress which is often neglected by low-income/ethnic minority families while only further undermines the SBFC method of counseling.Rawles, P. D. (2010). The link between poverty, the proliferation of violence and the development of traumatic stress among urban youth in the United States to school violence: A trauma informed, social justice approach to school violence. In Forum on Public Policy Online (Vol. 2010, No. 4). Oxford Round Table. New York: The New Press. SBFC Solutions SBFC practitioners address school violence in a number of ways. As a general strategy, SBFC practitioners collaborate with school administrators and teachers to increase student engagement. Student engagement refers to: having a sense of belonging and being a part of the school;experiencing teacher support and caring; having friends at school; and experiencing fair and effective discipline. SBFC strategies to promote student engagement include: promoting a positive school climate; strengthening school organization and infrastructure; and facilitating student interactions. Studies show that increasing student engagement reduces bullying and school dropout, and creates “caring schools” that are family-friendly and create a safe place for communities where violence is prevalent. Student engagement falls largely in the area of prevention through the SBFC meta-model and framework. Student engagement is a vital construct to be used in prevention and intervention efforts that target issues related to dropout prevention, bullying, and the behaviors associated with the disengagement of students to school (academic failure, chronic absenteeism, behavioral issues). Student engagement is the central construct in student dropout. It is the slow process of disengagement that contributes to student dropout. There are disproportionate rates of student dropout, chronic absenteeism, and behavior-related suspensions for black and latino/a students. Focusing on student engagement through the SBFC systemic model provides an infrastructure of protective factors that can mitigate negative influences and prevent involvement in school or community violence (Hernandez, 2020). Implementation of student engagement interventions through the SBFC model focusing on school prevention and family prevention have been found to be highly associated with student outcomes. SBFC practitioners following the SBFC meta-model focus their interventions on school prevention and family intervention which largely includes a “whole- school” approach engaging multiple stakeholders, most importantly families. SBFC also places importance on developing community resources to reduce school problems. Community violence is a complex problem and not easily solved – but SBFC practitioners view community intervention as part of their approach to helping children, families and schools.  Challenge: Trauma and mental health access  Low-income households often do not validate students' traumatic experiences and can show little interest in attending training with school counselors. Being low-income can produce various traumas that most families tend to ignore, creating a culture of mental health negligence and a lack of proper self care within these households. A 2008 survey shows that the mental health needs of the poor are often unmet due to the lack of insurance coverage.Thornicroft, G. (2008). Stigma and discrimination limit access to mental health care. Epidemiologia E Psichiatria Sociale, 17(1), 14-19. doi:10.1017/S1121189X00002621 A 2015 study found that 48% of whites received mental health services compared to 31% of African Americans and Hispanics, and 22% of Asians.Thornicroft, G. (2008). Stigma and discrimination limit access to mental health care. Epidemiologia E Psichiatria Sociale, 17(1), 14-19. doi:10.1017/S1121189X00002621 Mental health negligence can be attributed to low-income communities being often misdiagnosed and misunderstood with their trauma or mental healthcare overall. SBFC approaches can also fail to account for ethnic/cultural attitudes toward mental health. For example, Mexican American families were found to have a lower rate of mental health problems due to the strong cultural belief of natural healing in comparison to traditional psychiatric services.Vega, William A.; Rumbaut, Rubén G. (1991-08). \\"Ethnic Minorities and Mental Health\\". Annual Review of Sociology. 17 (1): 351–383. doi:10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002031. ISSN 0360-0572 SBFC Solutions Although SBFC practitioners often offer parent education training at school and community sites, parent consultation is the form of counseling most frequently provided by SBFC. Parent consultation can also be provided by phone or internet (Zoom) for parents who do not want to visit the school or community counseling center. While many low-income parents are not interested in participating in “therapy”, many are very interested in seeing their children succeed at school and welcome the opportunity to speak with a SBFC practitioner who treats them with respect and approaches them as equal partners in helping their child succeed. (Gerrard, Carter, & Ribera, 2020). Parents who do not feel comfortable attending a parent education workshop at their child’s school, may welcome meeting with the SBFC practitioner at the school or in a home visit, or through brief weekly phone calls. In rare situations where contact between the parents and SBFC counselor is not feasible, SBFC practitioners may use a family systems counseling approach with students that helps them to relate more constructively to their family and strengthen family relationships. Most SBFC programs based in schools, such as the Center for Child & Family Development Mission Possible program,the Families and Schools Together (FAST) program, the Linking the Interests of Families and Teachers (LIFT) program, and the Place2Be program were developed especially to reach low-income families and are free for students and families, making mental health services accessible to low income families. The educational focus of SBFC services also makes mental health counseling more accessible to these same families. '''  Barriers to Entry for SBFC  ''' The development of SBFC programs requires both cross-disciplinary and cross- cultural thinking and a willingness to set aside mental health professional \\"turf\\" issues. Graduates of mental health discipline academic programs who have not been exposed to other mental health professions, may develop a “silo” approach to mental health that leads to competition and “turf” battles with professionals from other disciplines. Strategies to overcome interprofessional barriers to SBFC practitioners include: using discipline inclusive language (e.g. SBFC practitioner rather than SBFC counselor, SBFC social worker, etc.; becoming familiar with the SBFC literature in other mental health professions; fostering a collaborative relationship with members of other mental health disciplines; gathering evidence-based support for your SBFC program; developing support from administrators leading the organization in which you are practicing an SBFC approach .

It is a delicacy commonly found in Javanese and Sundanese cuisine (of Java, Indonesia), and often consumed as a snack. It is similar to lontong, but with a stickier texture and richer flavor due to the use of coconut milk and peanuts. Lepet is made by steaming the ketan (sticky rice) until half cooked in coconut milk then mixed with pandan leaf and salt until all of the coconut milk is absorbed into the sticky rice. Then the half-cooked coconut milk sticky rice is mixed further with grated coconut flesh and peanuts then wrapped inside janur (young yellowish coconut leaf) in a cylindrical-shape and secured with strings made from coconut leaf fibers (or any kind of strings). The rice packages inside the coconut leaf are then steamed further until completely cooked. The most common filling is peanuts, however other kinds of beans such as kidney beans, cowpeas, jack beans, or corn might also be used. In the Sundanese area of West Java, it is known as leupeut and usually made in a smaller size with peanut filling and usually consumed with tahu sumedang (fried tofu). It is a popular snack in the Kuningan and Sumedang Regency.

April 13, 2011) was an American woman who disappeared on April 13, 2011, from her family home in Darden, Tennessee. Bobo was last seen alive by her brother, Clint, shortly before 8 a.m., walking into the woods outside her home with a man wearing camouflage. In September 2014, partial remains were found in northern Decatur County, and her death was ruled a homicide via a gunshot to the back of the head. Six men have been arrested for varying degrees of involvement in the crime. However, only three of the six have been prosecuted. Most of the arrests were made on the basis of a confession by a man with an intellectual disability named John Dylan Adams, who told police he saw his brother, Zach, and another friend, Jason Autry, with Holly at his brother's home after her kidnapping. It is unknown what led police to question Dylan about Bobo's disappearance. Dylan, Zach, and Autry were charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder and rape. Of the other three men arrested, charges against two men were dropped, and one committed suicide without any charges being filed against him. The case has been met with several setbacks such as the death of a suspect, multiple changes to the prosecutorial team, and disputes with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). The prosecution has been heavily criticized for its refusal to produce evidence against the defendants, missing multiple discovery deadlines, and for making frequent changes to the charges against the defendants with little explanation. The TBI even briefly withdrew its services to the entire district after the prosecutor accused it of compromising the case by proceeding \\"so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI... was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence.\\" Defense attorneys for the men said they still had yet to receive a bill of particulars detailing the case against their clients and the results of forensic testing done on evidence from the case over a year after the arrests were made, and filed motions to dismiss charges on the grounds of \\"silence or stonewalling.\\" The arrests took place in early 2014, but it was not until July 2015 that it was announced that the defendants finally received access to all the evidence against them. On September 22, 2017, a jury found Zach guilty on all charges, including first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years on September 23. He maintains his innocence. In January 2018, Zach's brother, Dylan, accepted an Alford plea and he was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Autry chose to make a deal with prosecutors wherein he would testify against Zach Adams in exchange for a significantly reduced sentence. On September 16, 2020, after accepting a plea deal that reduced his sentence to eight years of time served, Jason Autry was released from prison. History At the time of her disappearance, Holly Bobo was a 20-year-old nursing student in the Registered Nurse program at the University of Tennessee at Martin Parsons Center in Parsons, living with her parents and brother in Darden. Friends described her as shy and sweet. She was the cousin of country singer Whitney Duncan. In 2017, Duncan released a song called \\"Better Place\\" in memory of Holly. Disappearance A timeline of events on the morning of April 13, 2011, is given below, on the basis of witness statements and reported phone records: * 4:30 a.m. Holly awoke to study for an exam. * 7:30 a.m. Holly answered a call from her boyfriend, Drew Scott, who was turkey hunting nearby on her grandmother's property. Holly's parents had left for work by this point and her brother Clint was still asleep. * 7:42 a.m. Holly made her last cell phone call. After this point, all phone calls and texts were incoming and unanswered. At some point after this call ended, a neighbor heard a scream from the Bobo residence. * 7:46 a.m. The neighbor called his mother to tell her about the scream, who called Karen Bobo at work. * 7:50 a.m. Clint was awakened by the family dogs barking and saw a man with Holly outside. \\"It appeared to be Holly kneeling down and Drew [Scott]. They looked like they were kneeled down, facing each other in the garage, and they were talking back and forth. Holly sounded very upset and heated. He was doing much of the talking, and she would answer back and things like that. I couldn't make out hardly any of the words. The only words I could make out from here were Holly saying, 'No, why? Clint said that he believed the couple were breaking up. At some point, Karen called home and spoke to Clint. \\"I said, 'Clint, that's not Drew. Get a gun and shoot him. Clint reportedly replied, \\"You want me to shoot Drew?\\", still believing the man was Holly's boyfriend. * 7:55 a.m. Karen called 9-1-1, but because she was calling from work she reached the dispatcher for the wrong county. At home, Clint looked outside again and saw the man dressed in camouflage walking with Holly into the woods. At this point, he noted that the man with Holly was larger than Drew Scott. He tried to call Holly's cell phone as well as Scott's cell phone, but neither call was answered. * 8:00 a.m. Karen called her house again. Clint told her what he saw and she instructed him to call 9-1-1. Clint got a loaded pistol and went outside, where he found bloodstains belonging to Holly in the carport, then dialed 9-1-1. * 8:10 a.m. Police began to arrive at the Bobo residence. * 8:17 a.m. Cell phone pings showed Holly's cell phone moving away from her home tower heading north. Her cell phone continued north to a wooded area near Interstate 40, where her remains were eventually found. *8:30–9:00 a.m. The cell phone stopped moving for 20–30 minutes. The cell phone then began traveling south again using a different route. * 9:25 a.m. The last cell phone ping came from Holly's phone in the area where her phone and its SIM card were later found. Investigation Clint described the man as being between 5′10″ and 6 feet tall (1.78–1.80 m), weighing and having dark hair sticking out from under his cap that was long enough to cover his neck and touch his collar. Clint said the man was wearing a hat and camouflage clothing from head to toe and identified the pattern as either Mossy Oak break up or leafy wear. He described the male voice he heard as very deep and low. Extensive searches of the area were conducted following Bobo's disappearance. Several items belonging to Bobo were found scattered throughout the town, including her lunchbox, a receipt with her name on it, a card from school, her cell phone, and the SIM card, which had been removed from it. Early in the investigation, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) focused heavily on a registered sex offender who matched the witness description named Terry Britt. His home was wire-tapped and searched during the course of the investigation, but he was never charged. In September 2014, Bobo's partial remains were found by ginseng hunters in a wooded area of northern Decatur County, Tennessee, just off I-40, nearly 20 miles (32 km) from Darden. The owner of the property said it was not uncommon for people to hunt there without permission. One of the men who found the remains said he saw a large bucket in the woods, which he upturned. Details of the contents have not been released. He then spotted Bobo's remains spread on the ground behind him. Investigators recovered her skull, teeth, several ribs, and one shoulder blade. Her skull had a bullet hole in the back of it on the right with the trajectory going left, fracturing her left cheek bone when it exited. Arrests A total of six men have been implicated in connection with Bobo's disappearance, with the first of the arrests occurring in March 2014, prior to the discovery of Holly's remains. Zach Adams, his brother Dylan Adams, and friend Jason Autry were ultimately charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder, and rape. Another two men, Jeffrey and Mark Pearcy, were arrested on charges of accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence; however charges against the Pearcy brothers were dropped. Another man, Shayne Austin, committed suicide. It is unclear what initially led law enforcement to suspect these men, but the investigation began with the arrest of Dylan Adams on unrelated weapons charges. Following this arrest, he told police that he witnessed Bobo alive with his brother at Zach's home following her abduction. An affidavit for a search warrant states that Dylan told authorities that on April 13, 2011, he went to Zach's residence to get his truck. Dylan reportedly \\"observed Holly Lynn Bobo sitting in a green chair in the living room wearing a pink t-shirt, with Jason Wayne Autry standing just a few feet away.\\" He also told police Zach was \\"wearing camouflage shorts, black cut-off-sleeve t-shirt and a pair of green Crocs\\" shoes. Dylan also said that Zach told him \\"he had raped Bobo and videotaped it.\\" The alleged videotape has not been found. Dylan later recanted the confession and alleged that he was coerced, but his confession led to the arrests of Zach Adams, Jason Autry, and Shayne Austin. Many of the details contained in the confession were eventually found to be inconsistent with the known evidence, and the narrative presented later in court was vastly different. In early 2017, it was announced that Jason Autry had agreed to testify against Zach in exchange for leniency. In 2014, District Attorney Matt Stowe said he and the TBI were still \\"actively looking\\" to bring criminal charges against additional people, although he declined to name the parties or the charges. =Shayne Austin= Shayne Kyle Austin was initially offered immunity in exchange for information regarding the location of Bobo's body.Shayne Austin immunity agreement Phone records indicate that Austin was in contact with Adams several times on the day of Bobo's abduction and police believed that Austin helped dispose of the body. The agreement was withdrawn after Austin was unable or unwilling to lead them to the body and the district attorney released a statement saying that Austin \\"has not been completely truthful, forthcoming and cooperative as to any and all aspects of this investigation.\\" In April, Austin's attorney filed a complaint against the State asking for an immediate and permanent injunction preventing the state from charging Austin. Austin was found deceased in February 2015 while in custody at the Henderson County Sheriff's Department located in Lexington, TN while being held on unrelated previous charges of Theft and Burglary. He had committed suicide. Austin's attorney blamed the suicide on the continual threats of prosecution as well as the \\"witch hunt\\" style of investigation, where they relied on rumors instead of evidence. His attorney insists he had nothing to do with the murder and cooperated fully with police. =Jeff and Mark Pearcy= In July 2014, Jeffrey Pearcy and his brother Mark Pearcy were arrested and charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. They were arrested on the basis of allegations made by Jeff's former roommate Sandra King, who alleged that in May 2014, Jeff showed her part of a video showing Adams assaulting Bobo, who was tied up and crying. She told police that she watched only a small clip and did not see the sexual assault. Police arranged for King to make a recorded call to Jeff where she told him over the phone \\"That video of Holly, if it had been you, I would have watched it,\\" to which he replied, \\"I know.\\" King alleges that Pearcy's brother Mark shot the video. Both brothers deny that a video existed and Jeff Pearcy denies knowing the other men who have been arrested for the crime. Jeff claims that he was unable to hear Sandra during the phone conversation and that his ex-wife's name is also Holly. Police have analyzed over 20 phones but have not found any video. Charges against both men were subsequently dropped and the narrative described at Zach Adams's trial did not include any mention of involvement by the Pearcy brothers. Trial of Zach Adams In September 2017, Zach Adams was the first to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other forensic evidence tying him to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from those in Dylan Adams' confession. Autry testified that he was not involved in the abduction himself, but that he went to Austin's home to buy drugs, where he saw Austin and the Adams brothers disposing of evidence from the crime. Autry said that Zach Adams had a body in the back of his truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and that Austin was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel. Autry claimed that he agreed to help Zach Adams dispose of the body. They drove to a spot along the Tennessee River underneath the Interstate 40 bridge with plans to \\"gut\\" the body so that it would not float in the water. After unloading the body from the bed of the truck, they realized that Bobo was still alive, so Adams shot her in the back of the head. Fearing that the noise of the gunshot might have attracted attention, Adams and Autry loaded the body back into the truck, and Adams dropped Autry off. Autry testified that Adams later said that he had dumped the body near a place called Kelly Ridge. (Bobo's remains were found in a different location and it is unclear how the body ended up where it was ultimately found.) The narrative presented at trial was that Austin and the Adams brothers went to the Bobo residence to teach Clint Bobo to make methamphetamine, an allegation that Bobo denies. Holly Bobo came out of the home \\"screaming and hollering\\", and the men then abducted her. The prosecution alleged that Austin was the man whom Clint Bobo had described as walking into the woods with his sister, as he was the only one of the men who was close to the size of the man he had described. The three men were alleged to have raped Holly Bobo in a local barn owned by the grandmother of both Austin and Autry. Two pieces of paper belonging to Holly Bobo, a receipt and a note card, were found on the road where Austin lived; the receipt was found 75 feet from his driveway. The prosecution also presented other pieces of circumstantial evidence linking Zach Adams to the murder, including that he drove a white truck. A neighbor of the Bobo family had seen a white truck driving rapidly on the morning of the murder. A number of other witnesses testified that Adams made statements implicating himself in Bobo's disappearance. Adams' then-girlfriend Rebecca Earp testified that \\"He said he would tie me up just like he did Holly Bobo and nobody would ever see me again.\\" Zach Adams also allegedly threatened his brother after his arrest that he would \\"put him in a hole beside her\\" if he didn't keep his mouth shut. A gun, listed as an Arminius model HW5 32-caliber Smith & Wesson long revolver, was introduced into evidence by the prosecution. A local man, Victor Dinsmore, led police to the gun, claiming that Austin and Autry sold him the weapon in exchange for drugs. The gun was reportedly found underwater. Forensic tests on the weapon failed to find any DNA or fingerprints, and prosecutors were unable to link the gun to the case with ballistics tests On September 22, 2017, a jury found Zach Adams guilty on all charges, including first-degree murder, especially aggravated kidnapping and aggravated rape. On September 23, 2017, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole and two consecutive terms of 25 years for both the kidnapping and rape convictions. John Dylan Adams On January 18, 2018, John Dylan Adams pled guilty to charges of facilitation of first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. He was sentenced to 15 years for facilitation of first-degree murder and 35 years for especially aggravated kidnapping. Those sentences are set to run concurrently, meaning he will serve 35 years without parole. Dylan entered an Alford plea, a type of guilty plea in which the defendant does not admit to the criminal act and maintains his innocence, but concedes that the prosecution's case may result in a guilty verdict. Innocence claims Despite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men arrested for the crime have vehemently denied involvement in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators tried to get him to testify falsely against Zach Adams. The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that \\"[T]hey kept him up all night, would not give him anything to eat or drink and finally he said, 'What do you want me to say? According to family members, Dylan has some ability to read but cannot perform other tasks such as telling time, and they believe that Dylan is being manipulated. At the trial for Zach Adams, it was alleged that the state used unethical investigatory techniques to coerce a confession from his brother. In 2014, Dylan Adams was arrested on federal gun charges that would have ended in a lengthy prison sentence. The prosecutor, who was also handling the Bobo case, arranged a no-jail plea deal on the condition that he go live with a retired police officer, Dennis Benjamin, whom Dylan did not know. Five weeks later, Benjamin called 9-1-1 to report that he had someone in his home who wanted to confess to the murder of Holly Bobo. Despite the fact that this confession led to the arrests, much of what Adams confessed to did not match the evidence. Dylan Adams' mother claims that there was extensive coercion in his interrogation: \\"In this statement Dylan is trying to tell his story as to what happened, and you've got this TBI agent saying, 'Don't you mean this? Don't you mean it happened like this?' And, 'No, Dylan, it went down like this.' And you can honestly tell at [that] point that Dylan, I can as his mother, he gave up. He's like, 'OK, if that's what you said, OK. Jeffrey Pearcy also claims the statements regarding his involvement were fabricated by King to assist her son, who is serving a long prison sentence. \\"I have been up front and honest about everything. I have willingly given them everything. Take it, I mean, it's there,\\" he said. \\"My heart goes out to the Bobo family. It could have very well been one of my kids. For someone to give them false hope, and that's exactly what's been done to them,\\" he said. \\"But for the justice system to just haul someone in and destroy their whole life, I mean, there's no sense in that at all.\\" =Zach Adams defense= At Zach Adams' trial, his defense contended that he was \\"100% innocent.\\" The defense alleged that Autry concocted a story in exchange for a reduced sentence, and that although some of his story seemed to be corroborated, he had access to all of the details through discovery. The defense also pointed to the fact that cell phone pings did not follow the path that Holly Bobo's cell phone took and that none of the men matched the witness description given by Clint Bobo. The Adams brothers and Autry were all too tall and were either too slim or too heavy to be the abductor. Austin was the correct weight and height, but Bobo described a man with dark hair that covered his neck; Austin had short red hair. Former TBI agent Terry Dicus, who had been the lead investigator on the case, testified for the defense. He told the jury that he ruled the men out early in the case because Austin passed a polygraph, their alibis checked out and cell phone records put Zach Adams and Holly Bobo several miles apart during the critical timeframe. According to a defense expert, Adams' and Bobo's cell phones were in separate sectors during nearly the entire time frame of the abduction; the cell phones came into the same sector only at about 9:10 a.m., over an hour later. Dicus also noted that for Autry's story to fit with the cell phone pings, the men would have had to drive 106 miles per hour, a scenario that is unlikely on the winding gravel roads they traveled. The defense also noted that all four men had been ruled out as the originator of a palmprint found on Holly's car, while another suspect, Terry Britt, could not be excluded. =Terry Britt= Zach Adams' defense attorney, Jennifer Thompson, contended that the initial suspect in the case, Terry Britt, was the real killer, saying that he \\"has never been cleared by the TBI and in fact it appears the government has more evidence of his guilt than it does of the three defendants charged in the present case.\\" Britt is a convicted sex offender who has been convicted of multiple rapes. It was argued at trial that Britt fit the physical description and had a history of stalking blonde women. Clint Bobo also identified a voice sample of Britt's voice as being very similar to the voice he had heard that morning. Dicus testified that Britt had fabricated an alibi. Britt told investigators that his wife stayed home from work that morning to help him install a bathtub. Through the investigation, Dicus discovered that Britt's wife, Janet, had gone to work that morning, but Britt called and made her leave \\"on the biggest news day\\" of the county's history. The Britts did produce a handwritten receipt for the bathtub, but the store had no record of the sale. According to Dicus, Britt's wife had been with him on previous occasions when Britt had stalked girls. Britt could not be excluded as the contributor of the handprint. Dicus also testified that following the Bobo abduction, Britt allegedly changed his appearance by cutting his hair. A U.S. Marshals Service senior inspector testified that at one point, Britt said, \\"Sounds like you have it all figured out,\\" and said he would \\"plead to it,\\" but did not clarify specific charges or conditions for a plea deal. Criticisms of the prosecution The criminal case against the men charged has been met with strong criticism and conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation. District Attorney Matt Stowe was elected to office in the summer of 2014 following the arrests and stated that he believes he was elected in part due to skepticism regarding the arrests and questions over whether enough evidence exists against them to obtain a conviction. \\"[Voters] wanted another set of eyes on this Holly Bobo case; they weren't happy with everything that was coming out of there, and I think that they wanted someone else to take a look and someone else to say, 'We know what's going on. In the fall of 2014, Jason Autry's attorney, John Herbison, accused the prosecutor of arresting the defendants without probable cause as an unethical \\"investigatory technique\\", then adding and dropping charges strategically before hearings to avoid having to produce evidence against the defendants. In October 2014, when evidence tampering charges were dropped against Dylan Adams just days after he was charged with rape, Herbison said: \\"If those reports are correct, it means that they're just playing games,\\" Herbison said. \\"They charged him with something less serious in order to keep him locked up, and then when it comes time to answer questions about the charge, they dismiss that and charge him with a more serious charge in circuit court, where he's not entitled to a preliminary hearing.\\" He also noted the state's similar treatment of Mark Pearcy to avoid hearings. In August 2014, the state failed to arrange transport for Pearcy to the courthouse causing the hearing to be rescheduled for September, but just prior to the new hearing the charges against him were dropped with the explanation given that Pearcy was facing unrelated federal charges and they were being forced to wait to proceed with the state charges. Herbison said the laws regarding the charges would not preclude the state charges. \\"If the state is claiming that is the case, the prosecutor is either ill-informed or being disingenuous,\\" he said. Charges were never reinstated and the case against his brother, Jeff, was similarly dropped. Zach Adams's attorney, Jennifer Thompson, repeatedly said that evidence was not turned over to the defense. For example, in 2014, DA Matt Stowe made a statement that because Holly was menstruating at the time of her abduction there was a lot of DNA evidence in Zachary Adams's Decatur County home. No DNA evidence was ever turned over to the defense or produced at trial. She also said that the medical examiner referred to materials that were never given to her. On December 17, 2014, nine months after Zach Adams's arrest, Judge Creed McGinley chastised prosecutors for delays in the case and for the state's failure to turn over evidence to the defense. \\"I am absolutely out of patience with these cases not moving,\\" he said. Judge McGinley ordered that a bill of particulars be filed for Zachary Adams's case within seven days and that discovery take place immediately. The prosecution ignored both deadlines. In response, attorneys for the men filed motions to dismiss charges. The motions filed accused the state of \\"silence or stonewalling\\", stating that, among other things, the state had yet to disclose evidence that the skull found belonged to Bobo. \\"It would appear to me if they had a skull with a dental match they would have given that to us right away. It's a little suspicious why we don't have that forensic information,\\" said Autry's attorney Fletcher Long. Following the hearing in December 2014, a dispute regarding the handling of the case led the TBI to briefly drop its investigation of the case and cut ties with the entire district, saying District Attorney Matt Stowe had accused them of misconduct. The TBI agreed to come back on the case after Stowe recused himself from the case and Jennifer Nichols was appointed as special prosecutor. Following Stowe's allegations of misconduct by the TBI, the defense attorneys working on the case stated that they intended to subpoena Stowe to question him regarding the alleged misconduct. Emails by Wally Kirby, Executive Director of Tennessee District Attorney's Conference, revealed that Stowe accused TBI of compromising the case by proceeding \\"so slowly that the culprits were always one step ahead and that TBI...was leaking information and possibly covering up evidence.\\" Media coverage The case attracted a high level of national media coverage. Discovery Channel published an article several months after her disappearance, discussing how the high levels of media coverage, including some instances of inaccurate media coverage, hurt the investigation. A notable example of misinformation was the description of her last known movements. Early reports inaccurately reported that Bobo was dragged into the woods. Clint later clarified that Holly had, in fact, walked with the man wearing camouflage into the woods, either willingly or by coercion. This clarification led to rumors that Clint had changed his story and was a suspect in his sister's disappearance. Whitney Duncan defended him in an April 17 Twitter statement, stating that he was innocent and not a suspect in the case. Some early sources also erroneously reported that the skull was found on property owned by Zach Adams's family. Her body was found 10 miles away from Adams's property on land owned by the Tubbs family. Police received scores of erroneous tips from the public, including a number of \\"psychics\\", making it difficult for police to identify important leads. On September 29, 2017, the ABC Network aired an investigative journalism segment, \\"Justice for Holly Bobo\\", on its prime-time television program 20/20.

Early life  Anthony Joachim (Tony) Glynn was born in Casino, northern New South Wales in 1926, one of eight children of Harold Marcus Glynn, a successful store owner, and Nina Rose Glynn née Dougherty. Following the death of his mother, when he was six, her younger sister Molly stepped in to help raise the children. His aunt's decision to sacrifice her career and her own marriage plans offered a model of selflessness that deeply influenced the boy.Glynn, Paul. \\"Like a Samurai\\": The Tony Glynn Story. Sydney: Marist Fathers Books, 2008. Tony was attending boarding school in Sydney at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill when the British colony of Singapore fell to the Imperial Japanese Army in 1942. Because of widespread fear of a possible Japanese invasion of Australia, he and his younger brother Paul Glynn were called back to Lismore to finish their schooling at St John's College, Woodlawn.Brigginshaw, Jim. Shimpu-san: Healer of Hate. Lismore: Marist Fathers' Province of Australia, 1996.  Religious vocation  The Glynns were a devout Roman Catholic family of Irish immigrant stock. Three of the boys, John, Tony and Paul, would train for the priesthood at the Toongabbie (Sydney) seminary of the Society of Mary or Marist order. While studying at Toongabbie in 1946 Tony met Fr Lionel Marsden who while serving as a chaplain in the 8th Division Australian Imperial Force (AIF) had become a prisoner-of-war and been put to work on the notorious Thai-Burma Railway. Marsden later experienced a spiritual crisis in revulsion at his feelings of hatred for his former captors and decided to establish a mission in Japan with the aim of healing the wounds of war and promoting reconciliation. The newly-ordained Fr Tony Glynn was accepted for the Japanese mission in January 1952.  Nara  After arriving at the Marist headquarters in Kyoto, Tony went to work studying the Japanese language. His early pastoral duties included ministering to the sick at a leprosarium near Tokyo. The Allied military Occupation of Japan had just ended, and the defeated country showed many signs of the ravages of war. In 1953 Tony was appointed to a parish in the city of Nara. He visited the sick and prisoners in jail, taught Bible studies, ran youth groups and organised aid deliveries from abroad. During his career he delivered more than 150,000 items, such as winter clothing, to the poor. In this last endeavour he was assisted by his brother and fellow Marist priest, Fr John Glynn, who edited a magazine, The Harvest, that publicised the order's overseas missions. Tony also made a point of forging close ties with members of the Buddhist and Shinto faiths and he would lead seven pioneering Buddhist/Christian prayer pilgrimages to Pacific War sites, from Lae, in Papua New Guinea, to Nagasaki.Glynn, \\"Like a Samurai\\".  Marlon Brando and Glenn Ford  One night in May 1956 Tony Glynn took a telephone call at the Nara presbytery. On the other end of the line was the American actor Glenn Ford who was in Japan filming The Teahouse of the August Moon. Another member of the cast, Louis Calhern, had suffered a heart attack and died, explained Ford, could the priest come immediately? The next day Ford and fellow actor Marlon Brando arrived at the church to arrange Calhern's funeral. Ever eager to promote Japanese-American friendship, Tony alerted the press to the story. As Tony's brother, Fr Paul Glynn, writes: \\"After the obsequies, Glenn Ford joined Tony and his 45 boy scouts and American children from the US Marine Camp in a suki-yaki party.\\"Glynn, \\"Like a Samurai\\", p. 78.  Breaking down prejudice  Tony Glynn was posted back to Australia temporarily in 1957. When news circulated of his impending departure he was showered with gifts by parishioners, community organisations and local dignitaries grateful for his services to the people of Nara. This gave Tony the idea of making a public exhibition of the gifts, which included many valuable works of art. Back in Sydney he approached several potential venues, but none would accept the proposal. One store executive commented that ill- feeling towards the Japanese was so great \\"we couldn't guarantee safety\\".Glynn, \\"Like a Samurai\\", p. 85. The Glynns appealed to Prime Minister Robert Menzies for help. Menzies personally arranged for Mark Foy's department store to provide space and took time out to open the exhibition in August 1958. Tony toured the cultural display to more than 40 cities and towns in Australia and New Zealand.  Japanese swords  The publicity generated by the exhibition gave the priest an opportunity to spread the message of reconciliation. Some war veterans remained hostile, but others responded by coming forward with traditional Japanese swords they had picked up on battlefields in the Pacific or confiscated from surrendering Japanese soldiers. Tony Glynn undertook to return them to the families of their owners in Japan and for this purpose collected around 80 swords during his lifetime.Canberra Times, 28 April 1959.  Mixed-race children  On his return to Japan in 1959 Tony Glynn took up the cause of mixed-race children who had been left behind in the city of Kure where the British Commonwealth Occupation Force was based between 1946 and 1952. A welfare agency identified around 100 children—many fathered by Australian servicemen—who were in desperate need due to poverty and social prejudice. The priest thought they should be allowed into Australia to be adopted, but government officials refused to grant an exception to the White Australia policy. Tony campaigned to raise money to provide living allowances and pay for the education of the children in Japan.Hamilton, Walter. Children of the Occupation: Japan's Untold Story. Sydney: NewSouth Books, 2012/New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2013.  Honours  For the last 26 years of his life, Tony was pastor of Tomigaoka, a new suburb on the outskirts of Nara. He raised more than US$1 million to build a new church, convent and kindergarten and in the process won many admirers from both high and low of society. He drew hundreds, if not thousands, of Japanese to the Catholic faith—in a country where Christians make up less than 1% of the population. In the 1964 New Years' Honours List he was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). He was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1982 and also received the Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese Emperor in 1985.  Death  In 1982 Tony Glynn was first diagnosed with cancer, leading to a series of operations over the following decade. Concerned that if he went back to Australia for treatment he would never be able to return to Japan, he resolved to keep working in his parish at Tomigaoka until the end. In the last weeks of his life he was made an honorary citizen of Nara. He died on 1 December 1994. An estimated 5,000 mourners attended the wake and funeral mass.  Tributes  John Menadue, a former Ambassador to Japan, commented: \\"In his very direct way, Tony focused on the power of symbols and used them more effectively than any other person. He was the first to see a means to meet the need for reconciliation and forgiveness after the bitter war years and he became the heart and soul of it\\".Sydney Sunday Telegraph, 11 December 1994. Another friend, the author Morris West, said: \\"He believed what he taught [as a Marist missionary] and taught by his own example the essential message of the Gospel: reconciliation and love\\".Brigginshaw, Shimpu-san. Fr Paul Glynn, who has likewise been honoured for his achievements as a missionary and author, recalled: \\"Tony told me there is no cheap grace. We must struggle and sometimes suffer if we and others are to experience Christ's grace in ourselves and in those for whom we are responsible.\\"  Legacy  Tony Glynn has been the subject of two biographies: Shimpu-san: Healer of Hate by Jim Brigginshaw (1996) and \\"Like a Samurai\\": The Tony Glynn Story by Paul Glynn (2008). He was featured in a Japanese film documentary The Railroad of Love (1999) made by director Shigeki Chiba. His name was given to the Tony Glynn Australia-Japan Centre at the Lismore campus of Southern Cross University, which was dedicated in 2004. His image is preserved in a bronze plaque erected at Cowra, a city in country New South Wales that maintains close relations with Japan.

He has an acute ear, dazzling command of seemingly the entire history of pop and a pleasingly wide range of taste, drawing on examples from Gershwin to Guns 'n' Roses to make his points.\\" Lindgren, Michael. \\"What Makes Song Lyrics Poetry?\\" The Washington Post, March 13, 2017. Works on Ralph Ellison Bradley has published two books related to the novelist Ralph Ellison. Three Days Before the Shooting...: The Unfinished Second Novel, written by Ralph Ellison and edited by Bradley and John Callahan, is a collection of manuscripts from Ellison's never-completed second novel. Ellison began writing his second novel around the time of Invisible Man’s publication in 1952.Bradley, Adam. Ralph Ellison in Progress, \\"Yale University Press\\", 2010. Though he released several excerpts from his novel-in-progress over the next forty years, Ellison failed to publish the long-anticipated novel during his lifetime. In 1999, Callahan released a portion of Ellison’s novel under the title of Juneteenth.Gates, Jr., Henry Louis. “The Last Sublime Riffs of a Literary Jazzman”, \\"Time Magazine\\", June 28, 1999. At more than a thousand pages, Three Days Before the Shooting... constitutes the fullest version of Ellison’s uncompleted vision. Set at the dawn of the civil rights movement, the novel concerns the relationship between a black minister named Alonzo Hickman and his surrogate son of indeterminate race, Bliss, who grows up to become a racist New England senator. [Howard] Three Days Before the Shooting... was named one of the year’s best works of outsider fiction by NPR, one of “Oprah’s Books to Watch,” and a Best Book of 2010 by The Root.Evans, Danielle. “Us and Them: The Year’s Best Outsider Fiction”, \\"NPR\\", December 10, 2010.“Books to Watch For,” O Magazine, January 21, 2010.Walker, Rebecca. “The Root’s Top Ten Books of 2010” , The Root, December 11, 2010. Soon after the publication of Three Days Before the Shooting..., Bradley published Ralph Ellison In Progress, which traces the history of Ellison's composition of his two novels, one published to great acclaim, the other remaining unpublished until years after his death. Among the insights in the book is that Ellison was an early adopter of the personal computer as a tool of literary composition. Using an Osborne 1 and Osborne 2, marketed as among the world's first portable computers for business, and WordStar software, Ellison amassed several thousand pages of drafts related to his second novel.Baer, Drake. “The 'Game Of Thrones' Creator's Secret Weapon For Productivity Is A 31-Year-Old Word Processor”, \\"Business Insider\\", July 8, 2014. Bradley speculates that though the computer undoubtedly facilitated Ellison's productivity, it may well have inhibited his ability to complete his novel so long in progress. The African-American novelist Ishmael Reed observed that with Ralph Ellison in Progress “Adam Bradley has made literary criticism interesting again.” Ralph Ellison in Progress, \\"Yale University Press\\" website.

His documentary We The People, Genetically Modified? won first prize in C-SPAN's 2014 StudentCam competition. To collect the award, he visited the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. where he met and questioned former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, on matters concerning the National Security Agency's metadata collection. He recorded the short confrontation with his mobile phone, and the video subsequently went viral online.  Education/Personal Info  Andrew Demeter was born in Cleveland, Ohio, where he currently lives with his family. He attends high school and is now in his Junior year. When he was in sixth grade, Demeter started experimenting with his father's video camera by interviewing relatives during family gatherings. He later created technology and video game reviews and then, at 14, turned to political activism. Demeter has continued to hone his skills by posting videos about politics and current events on the \\"TeenTake\\" YouTube channel. In the future, Demeter plans to further develop his reporting and videomaking endeavors by traveling the world to \\"cover hot-button political issues with on-scene commentary.\\"  We The People, Genetically Modified? Documentary  In tenth grade, Demeter was informed by his computer teacher — Vicki Eby — of StudentCam, an annual video competition that invites middle- and high-school students to produce short documentaries on an issue of national importance. While at first Demeter juggled with ideas related to the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act or the implications of surveillance with military drones used in warfare, he eventually chose to document issues concerning genetically modified organisms, a topic that \\"transcends all sociopolitical boundaries.\\" Assisted by one of his classmates, Andrew Wright, Demeter produced We The People, Genetically Modified?, a 7-minute documentary that explores several facets of the GMO controversy, such as testing, labeling, and impacts on both the environment and human health. Demeter's documentary features C-SPAN programming (per contest requirements) and interviews with farmers, consumers, biologists, public health officials, and even investigative reporter Ben Swann. In April 2014, the video was chosen as one of five \\"First Prize\\" winners in the StudentCam competition. \\"That documentary was so clever,\\" said C-SPAN's founder Brian Lamb. Demeter was awarded a $3,000 cash prize for We The People, Genetically Modified?, which he joked he would invest in the biotech giant Monsanto. Later that month, Demeter visited Washington D.C. to participate in a roundtable discussion about his winning entry with Greta Brawner and the other top four winners. He also met with U.S. Senator Rob Portman.  Nancy Pelosi Confrontation  Demeter, on the same trip, toured the U.S. Capitol and landed a meeting with Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. During the appointment with Pelosi, Demeter questioned her support of the NSA's \\"illegal and ubiquitous data collection.\\" Pelosi replied, \\"I don't think we should not fund the National Security Agency. They do many, many things.\\" Demeter recorded the confrontation with his mobile phone, and uploaded it to YouTube. The video quickly went viral, with approximately 750,000 views since it was posted on June 2, 2014. Furthermore, the video attracted immediate media attention from outlets such as Fox News, Drudge Report, Russia Today, TheBlaze, and The Washington Times.  POLITICAST  On August 4, 2014, Demeter launched on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo a project dubbed \\"POLITICAST,\\" which \\"aim[ed] to become the first news and political broadcasting network run entirely by teenagers.\\" Demeter targeted the youth demographic because, in his view, teens are politically apathetic. Despite being the literal future of the world, the youth lack an interest in politics — he postulated — not only because they are disenfranchised, but also due to the intimidating and intentionally confusing \\"bureaucratic lexicon\\" of both policymakers and media pundits. Adopting the phrase \\"simplification [of information] without dilution [of content],\\" Demeter sought to combat the political apathy of his generation by harnessing the historically unprecedented reach and influence of the Internet, in hopes of rendering critical information more easily digestible, while also immersing the world's youth in both politics and journalism. POLITICAST was ultimately unsuccessful at meeting its funding goal of $50,000, raising only slightly over 4%. When asked prior to the project's deadline about its viability, Demeter responded, \\"At the end of the day, this is all reliant on the free market. If [POLITICAST] doesn't get funded, the market doesn't want it. If it does get funded, that means the youth [have] valuable opinions and people want to hear them.\\" Likewise, Demeter's brainchild was both glorified as an \\"ambitious dream\\" and also vilified as worthless.  Activism and Political Views  A self-described libertarian, Demeter attributes the Internet and other technology as key elements in achieving more freedom and autonomy from government. \\"The advent of Internet, social media in particular, has provided for humanity the ability to decentralize the traditional government narrative. No longer can government control media with such ease[;] Americans are becoming the new, alternative media. The potential power of information is literally in the hands and at the fingertips of millions of Americans.\\" Demeter credits Ron Paul, Glenn Beck, Adam Kokesh, and Jesse Ventura as his main ideological influences.

The houses were built by Oscar Richard Hundley, a prominent local judge and politician. Hundley built the two houses behind his own, along with a third one block away, in 1905. The houses all represent the transition from Victorian styles popular in the late 19th century to Colonial Revival styles of the early 20th century. A fire damaged the house at 400 Franklin Street in 1909, and a rear addition was likely added at this time. Hundley sold his own house the same year, and sold 400 Franklin in 1912 and 108 Gates Avenue in 1918. The houses are in use today as offices. 108 Gates, also known as the Hundley-Van Valkenburgh House, is a two-story house with strong Victorian influences. The main roof is a Dutch gable, with the gable projecting over a chamfered bay. Both floors of the chamfered bay have a small, multi-light window, while all other windows on the house are one-over-one sashes. 400 Franklin, also known as the Hundley-Clark House, is a two-story Dutch Colonial Revival structure, with the second floor featuring large gambrel gables. Both houses have similar full-width, one story porches, supported by plain wooden columns with tapered capitals. The houses also have similar front doors, with a transom and sidelights with diamond-shaped panes, although 108 Gates lacks the sidelights.

Born in 1934 as the only child in a poor family in Spain, Corripio’s family migrated to the Dominican Republic when he was still an infant, fleeing from the Spanish Civil War. The Corripio family went from rags to riches: his father, Manuel Corripio García, founded a small shop, and by the time of the death of the strongman Rafael Trujillo in 1961, Corripio García was the third richest man in the Dominican Republic, only after Trujillo himself and Rafael Esteva Menéndez (the founder of IMCA S.A.). The business grew and diversified, becoming in Grupo Corripio, an economic empire in the Dominican Republic creating over 12000 jobs; Corripio Estrada became the wealthiest man in the country.  Early life  Corripio Estrada born in 1934 in the Spanish village of Arroes, in Asturias, to Sara Estrada and Manuel Corripio García (1908–2004). In 1938, the Dominican Republic became his new home amid the Spanish Civil War. Corripio studied at the De La Salle School in Santo Domingo, where he directed its monthly periodical; he graduated in 1951. On 16 August 1963, Corripio married Ana María Alonso, a native of Piloña (Asturias), at the Holy Cave of Covadonga (Asturias). They have 4 children: Manuel, José Alfredo, Lucía, Ana. Manuel married to Rafaela Martínez; José Alfredo married Laura Pereda; Lucía married Alejandro González; Ana married Rafael Barceló. During the decade of the 70's, Corripio was kidnapped by the Sanchez Tejada brothers' band, and kept holed up for days inside a water reservoir (cisterna) near the San Isidro's Air Force base. During the time Corripio remain kidnapped, the kidnappers made him believe they were members of the military. The Sanchez Tejada brothers had an auto mechanics shop near the Braulio Alvarez city park where they would disassemble stolen vehicles for stolen parts profiting. One of the Sanchez Tejada brothers resided in the Jose Amado Soler street in the affluent Naco neighborhood.

The framework uses static routing in the form of: \` <base URL>/<module name>[/<action name>] \` \`<module name>\` is determined from the name given as argument to \`RegisterHTTPModule\` call, while \`<action name>\` is determined from the key in the action map of each module. As alternative, GET style routing is also supported: \` <base URL>/?module=<module name>[&action=<action name>] \` The string \\"module\\" and \\"action\\" can be configured through \`ModuleVariable\` and \`ActionVar\`, respectively. Request handling is done in cascading manner using the following algorithm: # Execute module's request handler (TFPWebModule.OnRequest) # If the request is handled (TFPWebModule.OnRequest Handled parameter set to true), send the response # Otherwise, delegate request handling to web actions ## Find web action corresponds to current request path, optionally use redirection/rewriting (TFPWebModule.OnGetAction) ## If found, execute the web action's request handler (TFPWebAction.OnRequest) ### If the request is handled (TFPWebAction.OnRequest Handled parameter set to true), send the response ### Otherwise, raise request not handled exception ## Otherwise, raise request not handled exception  References   Further reading  * Leonardo M.

His home was at the southeast corner of Main and Arcadia streets. Here he built a substantial, wide spreading adobe surrounding a large courtyard. The house was a one-story adobe, and covered the entire ground occupied by the block, with an extensive \\"patio\\" or inner court in the center. When the outer gates were closed, this was a citadel capable of withstanding a siege. The residence was on the site of what became the Baker Block; and it was for many years, both before and after the change of government, a prominent social center for Southern California. Abel Stearns was married to Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker, and it was at this home that the famously beautiful daughters of Don Juan Bandini (Arcadia, Josefa, and Ysidora) entertained their wide circle of acquaintances from San Diego and Santa Barbara at grand balls and other social functions characteristic of life in Spanish countries. Here Commodore Jones in 1842, and Captain Fremont in 1846 and 1847, and other distinguished historical figures at various periods were hospitably entertained. History Abel Stearns bought the lot at Main and Arcadia streets. in 1834. The house was erected between 1835 and 1838. It was a flat-roofed one-story structure covering a large area. At the corner of Arcadia and Main streets, a wing extended out to the line of the sidewalk. At the southern end, there was a similar projection. The central part of the building stood back from the street and the space between it and the sidewalk was paved with cobble stones. In the rear was a large patio or court yard partially enclosed by projecting wings from the main building. There was also a patio. The lot extended through to Los Angeles Street. Within the home, the city's elite as well as foreign guests were often entertained. Here Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones of the United States Navy and his officers were lodged and entertained when the Commodore came to Los Angeles to meet Governor Manuel Micheltorena and apologize to him for capturing Monterey. At the Stearns house occurred the flag episode of 1839, which came near precipitating a revolution. Prefect Cosme Pena, appointed by Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado to keep the turbulent Angelenos in subjection, had established his headquarters in the Don Abel Stearns house. In front of the house, he had raised the flag of his prefecture and planted a cannon. Stearns, with but little respect for the Mexican flag (he hated Mexico), used the flagstaff for a post to tie cattle to, that were designated for slaughter. This desecration the patriotic young Angelenos resented; and while Pena was absent at San Pedro, a number of them gathered to pull down the flag; or as another account says, to sacrifice a bullock that was picketed to the flag pole as a peace offering to the outraged dignity of the cactus-perched eagle of the Mexican flag. Pena, on his return, had the leaders arrested for sedition and obtained a guard of ten soldiers to protect his flag. The citizens petitioned the Ayuntamiento to ask him to remove the flag to the public building where it would be treated with more respect, Pena, in a rage, resigned his office and left breathing vengeance against the Pueblo de Los Diablos (town of the devils). He reported his grievances to Governor Alvarado at Monterey. The twenty patriotic citizens who signed the petition were fined US$5.00 each, and the members of the Ayuntamiento, US$10.00 each, for their attempts to secure respect for the flag. The Stearns house was demolished in 1876, and the Baker Block erected on its site.

He studied natural sciences and medicine in Geneva, and following graduation, returned to Paris as an assistant to psychiatrist Gaétan de Clérambault. In 1928 he became a privat-docent for neurology and psychiatry. In 1941 he became an associate professor at Geneva, where in 1960, he was appointed professor of neurology and director of the university neurological clinic. From 1962 onward, he was also in charge of the neurological polyclinic.Georges de Morsier @ Who Named It Known for his research of visual hallucinations, he is credited with coining the terms \\"Charles Bonnet syndrome\\" (named after Swiss biologist Charles Bonnet) and \\"Zingerle syndrome\\" (named after Austrian neurologist Hermann Zingerle) for specific hallucinatory conditions. He also honored his mentor, Gaétan de Clérambault, with a syndrome -- it being defined as a hallucinatory state characterized by auditory and visual hallucinations associated with chronic psychosis.The term \\"Clérambault syndrome\\" is also used to denote a delusional syndrome characterized by erotomania. The condition was earlier described by Clérambault in the context with his research on mental automatisms. The eponym \\"De Morsier's syndrome\\" is a synonym for septo-optic dysplasia.

Madhu-vidya or 'Honey-knowledge' is that of the supreme Bliss of the Self; it is an important Vedic teaching. This knowledge is meant to be communicated by the teacher to the disciple, by father to the son – who is worthy and inwardly ready. Indra taught Madhu-vidya to Rishi Dadhichi with a warning that it should not be communicated to anyone else. Vedic background In the Rig Veda, Soma, the Vedic symbol for deep spiritual truth, is addressed as Madhu, the nector or ambrosia, the drink of Immortality sought by both gods and men. Rishi Vamadeva has described how the saving of the knowledge of Madhu or Soma Doctrine came to him through a hawk in a sudden flash in his darkest hour. It is believed that Rishi Dadhichi had his ashrama in Dudheshwara on the banks of Sabarmati River near present-day Ahmedabad. His name appears in the Rig Veda. Dadhichi was a sage of Vedic repute (Rig Veda I.84.13: इन्द्रो दधीचो अस्थ भिर्वृत्राण्यप्रतिष्कुतः जघान नवतीर्नव ). He was the son of Rishi Atharvan of the Atharvaveda, and the father of Pippalada of the Prasna Upanishad. His name is seen to occur in the first Mandala of the Rig Veda, and in the Bhagavata Purana. Rishi Kakshivana,the sage of the Rig Veda Sukta 119 which is addressed to the Ashvins, in Mantra 9 tells us : :उत स्या वां मधुमन्मक्षिकारपन्मदे सोमरयौशिजा हुवन्यति  :युवं दधीचो मन आ विवास्थोऽथा शिरः प्रति वामश्व्यं वदत्  :\\"The bee desirous of honey sang praise-song for you. Aushij in delight of Soma tells how Dadhichi, told you the secret of his mind after the head of his horse was cured.\\" Dadhichi's exposition Dadhichi knew the secret of the Madhu-vidya; he held the doctrine of the mutual interdependence of things, because all things are indissolubly connected in and through the Self. As all the spokes are contained between the axle and felly of a wheel, all things and all selves are connected in and through the Supreme Self. Nothing exists that is not covered by the Supreme Self. Thus, he taught the doctrine of the supreme existence of the one, and the apparent existence of the many. Dadhichi states that the sun is surely the honey of the gods. Of it, heaven is surely the bent bamboo. The intermediate-space is the hive. The rays are the off-springs. Of that sun, those which are the eastern rays, they themselves are its eastern cells. The Rk-mantras are verily the bees. The Rig Veda is indeed the flower. Those waters are the nectars. They, which are verily these Rk-mantras – heated up this Rig Veda. From that which was heated up issued the juice in the form of fame, lustre, vigours of organs, strength, and eatable food. It flowed profusely and settled on a side of the sun. That verily is this, which is the red appearance (aspect) of the sun. Thus, he begins narrating the scheme of colours – red, white and black which are the different colours of the sun, and concludes that the Vedas indeed are the nectars.\` Significance Madhu-vidya occupies a unique place in the Upanishadic scheme of upasana , due to its supremely hidden significance and peculiarly mystic presentation. Chandogya Upanishad takes the Sun as the main symbol and works out the vidya thereon; Brihadaranyaka Upanishad depicts a long series of cause and effect, showing their mutual interdependence and finally leads to the Atman which is shown to be the supreme source of everything else. Sankara takes madhu to mean effect, and he also accepts the primary sense of delight. The effects that flow are not mere imaginary things but are actualities that become visualised; every effect takes shape in a particular form or colour which signifies its concretisation and completion but the essence or the honey has no particular form or colour because it happens to be beyond all manifestations; it is recognized by the heaving at the centre of the Sun. Chandogya Upanishad concludes by saying that, to him, who gains this knowledge, there dawns the eternal day. In the case of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the search for the essence begins with the earth, the essence of all bhutas or creatures, the effects of the earth and essence are identical. All physical, moral and psychical principles make up man who in turn produces these principles, beyond man is the composite self of body, mind etc., the producer of all this – this Brahman is the Atman, the very self of the seeker; nothing exists apart from it, everything is of the nature of everything. Implication Madhu-vidya establishes the following five truths:- :1) The correspondence and interrelationships between the elements of the external world and the individual beings are analogous to those existing between the honey and the bees. :2) There is only one supreme god and that is Brahman. All the divine powers witnessed in the macrocosm (the external world) and the microcosm (the individual being), are but his manifestations. Brahman behind the cosmic universe is same as the Atman underlying the individual self. :3) Brahman exists within each and every element of the external universe and also within the individual beings as their essence (Dharma or law). He is immanent through and through. The idea of transcendent God separate from the external universe and the individual is rejected. :4) The eternal laws governing the union of the two fundamental principles – Annam ('matter') and the prana ('life- breath') – and the interaction between the elements of the macrocosm and the microcosm and the evolutions from these interactions and unions are also Brahman. :5) Brahman is an integral whole and unity like a wheel; in Brahman are held together all the elements of the external universe, all worlds, all divinities and all breathing creatures. Chandogya Upanishad (III.i.1) begins teaching Madhu Vidya by stating – The Sun is verily honey to the Devas (Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Maruts and Sadhyas), the Heaven is like the cross-beam, the intermediate region is the beehive; and the rays are the sons. But, this vidya does not teach meditation on Devas but on Brahman who is also known by the names Devas are known; it is a Brahma-vidya. The bondage that is experienced as individuals is due to the emphasis on individuality rather than the task, and independently on the cause which is organically connected by the same Atman that is present in both; the essence of the Madhu-vidya is the cosmic contemplation of the reality of Prana within and Vayu outside, and the correlation with the Universal Consciousness. Tantra sadhana Transformation of Jiva into Shiva is the goal of Tantra sadhana; Jiva is Shiva in the state of bondage due to samskaras whose increase must be halted for attaining release. When a sadhaka takes initiation he comes to know the art of stopping further increase of samskaras. This art is known as Madhu-vidya whose practice burns the seed of samskaras and paves the path for liberation.

George Karslidis was born in 1901 in Chadik, Tsalka, Georgia. His grandparents were refugees who had come from Argyroupolis, Pontos following the Crimean War. At a young age, he is orphaned, losing both his father and his mother on the same day. Wounded by the abusive treatment given to him by his older brother, he escaped, alone, to the mountains, where he was saved by Turkish villagers, who took him with them back to Pontos.Excerpt From: Anonymous. “Saint George of Sipsa, From Child to Saint.” iBooks. He is known to have been in Georgia, Armenia, and Russia before spending most of his life in the village of Taxiarches (Sipsa), in Drama, Northern Greece. He founded the Monastery of the Ascension of Christ in the village of Taxiarches (Sipsa), which was officially consecrated in 1939, and became the spiritual leader of the community of Drama. Like other contemporary elders and many saints throughout Christian history, Karslidis would sometimes be seen levitating in prayer during the Divine Liturgy.Middleton, Herman A. \\"Elder George of Drama.\\" In: Precious Vessels of the Holy Spirit: The Lives and Counsels of Contemporary Elders of Greece. 2nd Edition.

He was glorified on Sunday November 2, 2008, during the visit to the city of Drama of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, and his Feast Day is celebrated every year on November 4.

However, while he was still an infant, his parents died on the same day, and he was raised by his grandmother, who raised him with exemplary Pontic piety. From a very early age, Karslidis gave signs of his inclination towards God. While still a child, he prayed constantly, practiced fasting, and at the age of seven years he went on a pilgrimage to venerate Panagia Soumela, at the Soumela Monastery. At the age of just nine years old Karslidis became a Novice monk at a monastery in Georgia, after travelling to Tiflis, Georgia, where a priest cared for him. Thus beginning his monastic life, he waited nearly ten years to be officially tonsured a monk, which took place in July 1919, at the age of eighteen. He was given the new name Symeon.Middleton, Herman A. \\"Elder George of Drama.\\" In: Precious Vessels of the Holy Spirit: The Lives and Counsels of Contemporary Elders of Greece. 2nd Edition.

During the days of the persecution of the church by the communists in Georgia, Karslidis and his fellow monks were arrested as \\"enemies of the state\\", suffering imprisonment, humiliation, executions, public shaming, and tortures. He was sentenced to death by firing squad, and was shot, but survived miraculously, as the three bullets which hit him only grazed him, and did little harm. Karslidis was given the new name George.

In 1938 the Greek government made a permanent distribution of farmland, and Karslidis was given an acre of land, on which he managed to build the foundations of a humble monastery dedicated to Christ's Ascension. The monastery was officially consecrated in 1939. Karslidis foresaw the coming of World War II as well as the Greek Civil War that would follow it. He was sentenced to death for the second time in his life in 1941 by Bulgarian forces, but after he prayed with calmness and asked them to proceed with their work, they abandoned him out of fear and ran away; thus once again he survived miraculously. Karslidis died a few hours after midnight on November 4, 1959, and was buried behind the Katholikon of the Monastery of the Ascension.  Monastery of the Ascension  After Karslidis' death, the monastery he had worked so hard to establish fell into disrepair until 1970, when Metropolitan Dionysios (Kyratsos) of Drama undertook its renovation. Since then the monastic life has been re-established, with a monastic sisterhood dedicated to Christ, and to the memory of the monastery's founder.Middleton, Herman A. \\"Elder George of Drama.\\" In: Precious Vessels of the Holy Spirit: The Lives and Counsels of Contemporary Elders of Greece. 2nd Edition.

These 7 characteristics are also divided into 4 levels.  Animals  Sheep, Puppies, Cats, Cows, Pigs, and Donkeys are animal characters that help users earn money for the gameplay.  Special Characters  Due to a cross promotion with Sanrio, there are special characters in Dragon Friends, including Hello Kitty, My Melody, Kuromi, and Cinnamoroll. These characters were first released through the special event.  Updates  Updates of Dragon Friends are consistent and mainly serviced in special days such as Christmas and Valentine's Day. In such days, Dragon Friends provides chances for users to get special characters which can only be taken in a limited event period. The first big update had added the extra islands which allow users to add additional small islands near their mainland. Players freely decorated the main island and it amplified flexibility of the game. Also it added Safe Touch, which protected the user from mistakenly using resources by asking twice for the decision-making.

Central Huijin Investment is a state-owned enterprise and wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, a sovereign wealth fund that reports to the State Council of the People's Republic of China.  Controversies  In September 2016, the largest DDoS attack to date, on KrebsOnSecurity.com, was traced back to a botnet. According to internet provider Level 3 Communications, the most commonly infected devices in this botnet were Dahua and Dahua OEM cameras and DVRs. Nearly one million Dahua devices were infected with the BASHLITE malware. A vulnerability in most of Dahua's cameras allowed \\"anyone to take full control of the devices' underlying Linux operating system just by typing a random username with too many characters.\\" This was exploited, and malware installed on devices that allowed them to be used in \\"both DDoS attacks as well as for extortion campaigns using ransomware.\\" In March 2017 a backdoor into many Dahua cameras and DVRs was discovered by security researchers working for a Fortune 500 company. The vulnerability had been activated on cameras within the Fortune 500 company's network, and the data trafficked to China through the company's firewall. Using a web browser, the vulnerability allowed unauthorised people to remotely download a device's database of usernames and passwords and subsequently gain access to it. Dahua issued a firmware update to fix the vulnerability in 11 of its products. Security researchers discovered that the updated firmware contained the same vulnerability but that the vulnerability had been relocated to a different part of the code. This was characterized by the security researchers as deliberate deception. Dahua has played a role in the mass surveillance of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In October 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security sanctioned Dahua for its role in surveillance of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and of other ethnic and religious minorities in China.

It is considered as part of the Latin-American indigenista movement. Set in the village of Puquio (in the Southern Sierra of Peru) it depicts the performance of a bullfight in the Andean style (turupukllay) as part of a celebration called 'yawar punchay'. According to critics, is the most successful of Arguedas' novels, from a formal point of view. The author's effort is appreciated for offering the most authentic version possible of Andean life, without resorting to convention or the paternalism of previous indigenous literature. Plot The novel relates one of the most traditional customs of the indigenous communities of Peru: the \\"Indigenous bullfight\\", that takes place every year on the 28th of July, the anniversary of the founding of Peru. The indigenous bullfight is a spectacular event where a bull (which wears a \\"pampon\\") must confront one or two hundred \\"Indians\\" who can be professional toreros or spontaneous \\"capeadores\\". The event is accompanied by elements such as music of wakwak'ras (trumpets made from the bulls' horns), traditional chants (huaynos), consumption of hard liquor, usage of dynamite in order to kill the bull, and even death of the participants who were gored during the event. This tradition is threatened by an order from the capital, which prohibits what is considered a 'barbarian' practice. Faced with the refusal of the Indians to comply with the order, the authorities seek a way to allow the bullfights to be performed 'decently': by hiring a professional bullfighter (toreador) who will flight in the 'Spanish' tradition. With this, the very essence of the festival is threatened, but it is ultimately carried out anyway, the Indians reinstating their tradition in the eyes of the village leaders. It is worth noting that Arguedas' story does not mention the tying of a condor to the back of the bull, that is currently the most well-known variant of Yawar Fiesta. Composition The theme of an Andean (or 'Indian') style bullfight as the center of a conflict between races and social groups in a village in the Peruvian Andes came to Arguedas when, according to his confession, he attended a bullfight in Puquio in July 1935. On this occasion one of the Indian capeadors (matador assistants), nicknamed Honrao, was gored by the bull. In 1937 Arguedas published two stories which preceded the novel. One entitled \\"The Dispossession\\", which appeared in the Lima magazine 'Palabra', No. 4, April (which later became the second chapter of the novel); and the other entitled \\"Yawar (Festival)\\", published in the 'Revista Americana', Year XIV, No. 156, in Buenos Aires (which is a primitive draft of the novel). His desire to remake the story was interrupted by his stay at the El Sexto prison, between 1937-38, therefore he could only re-start writing in the second half of 1940, after attending the Indian Congress of Patzcuaro, in Mexico. He was then in Sicuani, where he was teaching at a public school. Taking advantage a school vacation, Arguedas wrote the novel non-stop. One incentive was a competition of Latin-American novels announced by a publisher in the United States: juries gathered in each Hispanic country were to select a representative novel which would be sent to an international jury sponsored by said publisher. In Peru, the national jury consisted of Augusto Tamayo Vargas, Estuardo Núñez and Luis E. Valcárcel, among others. As he progressed on chapters of his novel Arguedas sent them to Lima, to his friend the poet Manuel Moreno Jimeno. The correspondence between them documents Arguedas' work in detail. But he must have been disappointed that his novel was not chosen to represent Peru in the international competition, being displaced by the work of an unknown, José Ferrando, entitled 'Panorama hacia el alba' (Panorama toward dawn). The winner of the international competition was the indigenous novel by Ciro Alegría, 'El mundo es ancho y ajeno' (Broad and Alien is the World), sent on behalf of Chile, where its author was exiled.Vargas Llosa 1996, pp. 114; 127-128. Themes The principal theme is the performance of the Andean-style bullfight. Secondary themes are: the encroachment of white or misti (mestizo) people into Puquio, the abuses and violence of the gamonales (parasitic landlords) towards the Indians, the construction of the road from Puquio to Nazca, and the migration of thousands of Indians to Lima.

Electron was developed to service the commercial small satellite launch market. Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket. Although the rocket is designed to be expendable, Rocket Lab considers adding capabilities to reuse the first stage of Electron. In December 2016, Electron completed flight qualification. The first rocket was launched on 25 May 2017, reaching space but not achieving orbit due to a glitch in communication equipment on the ground. During its second flight on 21 January 2018, Electron reached orbit and deployed three CubeSats. The first commercial launch of Electron, and the third launch overall, occurred on 11 November 2018.  Design  Electron uses two stages with the same diameter () filled with RP-1/LOX propellant. The main body of the rocket is constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material. Both stages use the innovative Rutherford rocket engine, the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital rocket. The electric pumps are powered by Li-Polymer batteries. The second stage uses three batteries which are \\"hot swapped\\", two of the batteries are jettisoned once depleted to shed mass. There are nine Rutherford engines on the first stage and one vacuum-optimized version on the second stage. The first stage engines deliver of force and the second stage delivers of force. Almost all of the engines' parts are 3D printed to save time and money in the manufacturing process. Rocket Lab has also developed an optional third stage designed to circularize the orbits of its satellite payloads. The stage also puts satellites into a more accurate orbit in less time. This \\"kick\\" stage employs a new rocket engine, named Curie, that is capable of performing multiple burns, uses an unspecified \\"green\\" bipropellant, and is 3D printed. It was first used during Electron's second flight. The \\"kick\\" stage can transport up to of payload. Another third stage design, called 'Photon', is being developed to inject small payloads up to into lunar orbit. = Production = Manufacturing the carbon composite components of the main flight structure has traditionally required 400 hours, with extensive hand labor in the process. In late 2019, Rocket Lab brought online a new robotic manufacturing capability to produce all composite parts for an Electron in just 12 hours. The robot was nicknamed \\"'Rosie' the Robot\\", after The Jetsons character. The process can make all the carbon fiber structures, as well as handle cutting, drilling, and sanding such that the parts are ready for final assembly. The company objective as of November 2019 is to reduce the overall Electron manufacturing cycle to just seven days. Rutherford engine production makes extensive use of additive manufacturing and has since the earliest flights of Electron. This allows the capability to scale production in a relatively straightforward manner by increasing the number and capability of 3D printers. = Reflight = On 6 August 2019 Rocket Lab announced recovery and reflight plans for the first stage of Electron, although plans had started internally from late 2018. Electron was not originally designed to be a reusable launch vehicle as it is a small-lift launch vehicle but was pursued due to increased understanding of Electron's performance based on analysis of previous flights though sensors on the vehicle. In addition, reusability was pursued to meet launch demands. To counteract decreased payload capacity caused by recovery technology, performance improvements to Electrons are expected. Early phases of recovery included data gathering and surviving atmospheric reentry also known as \\"the wall\\". The next phase will require a successful deployment of an aerodynamic decelerator or ballute to slow the booster followed by the deployment of parafoil concluded by a touchdown in the ocean. After a successful touchdown in the ocean the stage would be moved onto a ship for refurbishment and reflight. Rocket Lab has not released information on aerodynamic decelerator that would be required to slow down the booster after atmospheric reentry. Late phases Electron reuse will involve using a parafoil and mid-air retrieval by a helicopter. After a successful mid-air retrieval the helicopter would bring the Electron to a ship that would bring the stage to the launch site for refurbishment and launch.  Aerothermal decelerator  Rocket Lab, while investigating reusability, decided that they will not pursue propulsive recovery like SpaceX. Instead they will use the atmosphere to slow down the booster in what's known as \\"aerothermal decelerator\\" technology. The exact methods used are proprietary but may include keeping proper orientation when reentering the atmosphere and other technologies. = Vehicle modification history = The Electron initially had a payload capacity of to a x Sun-synchronous orbit. In pursuit of reusability, Rocket Lab has made changes to Electron. Flight 6 and 7 (\\"That's a Funny Looking Cactus\\" and \\"Make it Rain\\") had instruments on the first stage needed to gather data to help with the reflight program. Flight 8 (\\"Look Ma No Hands\\") had Brutus, an instrument that collected data from the first stage to study reentry and was designed to be able to survive splashdown in the ocean. Flight 10 (\\"Running out of Fingers\\") had a block update to the first stage of the Electron to allow the first guided reentry of the first stage booster. Updates included additional hardware for guidance and navigation; onboard flight computers; and S-Band telemetry to both gather and livestream data gathered during reentry. The first stage also had a reaction control system (RCS) to orient the booster. After stage separation, the first stage using the new hardware installed flipped 180° to prepare for reentry. Throughout the reentry the stage was guided though the atmosphere such that it has the right orientation and angle of attack for the base heat shield to protect the booster from destruction using RCS and onboard computers. The booster successfully survived its guided re-entry despite having no deceleration hardware onboard and destructively splashed down into the ocean at as planned if reentry was successful. Rocket Lab had no plans to recover the stage and instead wanted to demonstrate the ability to successfully reenter. Flight 11 (\\"Birds of a Feather\\") demonstrated similar success. No further atmospheric reentry tests similar to flight 10 and 11 are expected. Following flight 11 in mid-February 2020, low altitude tests were done to test parachutes. In April 2020 Rocket Lab shared the successful demonstration of mid-air retrieval done in March 2020. An Electron test article was dropped by a helicopter and deployed its parachutes. A helicopter carrying a long-boom snagged a drogue line from the parachute at demonstrating a successful retrieval. Following the catch the test article was brought back to land. Flight 17 will demonstrate a parachute full recovery with a splashdown into the ocean. In August 2020 Rocket Lab announced increased payload of Electron to . The payload capacity increase was mainly due to battery advancements. The increased payload capacity allows offset of mass added by recovery technology. In addition, more payload mass could be flown on interplanetary missions and others when Electron is expended. Rocket Lab also announced expanded fairings with a diameter, larger than the standard long and in diameter fairings.  Use  Electron is designed to launch a payload to a Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and other small payloads. In October 2018 Rocket Lab opened a factory large enough to produce more than 50 rockets per year according to the company. Customers may choose to encapsulate their spacecraft in payload fairings provided by the company, which can be easily attached to the rocket shortly before launch. The starting price for delivering payloads to orbit is about $7.5 million per launch, which offers the only dedicated service at this price point. Moon Express contracted Rocket lab to launch lunar landers (multiple launches contracted, some planned for Moon Express operations after GLXP) on an Electron to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize (GLXP). None of the contenders met the prize deadline, and the competition was closed without a winner. For sometime after the closure of GLXP, the Moon Express Electron launches remained scheduled, but before February 2020, all the launches of Moon Express using Electron were canceled.  Launch sites  Mahia launch site under construction in 2016 The rocket is launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 on Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand. The launch pad's remote and sparsely populated location is intended to enable a high frequency of launches. The rocket and launch pad were both privately funded, the first time all parts of an orbital launch operation were entirely run by the private sector (other private spaceflight companies lease launch facilities from government agencies or only launch suborbital rockets). In October 2018, Rocket Lab selected Virginia Space's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at the Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia, as its future secondary launch site in the United States, called Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2. The first launches from Wallops are planned in the third quarter of 2020. Launch Complex 2 is expected to serve government customers. Additionally, the UK Space Agency is giving Highlands and Islands Enterprise the opportunity to develop an Electron launch pad on the A' Mhòine Peninsula in Sutherland, Scotland. The location would be named Sutherland spaceport.  Launch history  A National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) payload was successfully launched aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Launch Complex-1 The Electron has flown 14 times since May 2017. There have been 12 successes and 2 failures. The initial test flight, called \\"It's a Test\\", failed due to a glitch in communication equipment on the ground, but the follow-up missions, called \\"Still Testing\\", \\"It's Business Time\\" and \\"This One's For Pickering\\", delivered multiple small payloads to low Earth orbit. In August 2019, a mission named \\"Look Ma, No Hands\\" successfully delivered four satellites to orbit, and in October 2019, the mission named \\"As the Crow Flies\\" successfully launched from Mahia LC-1, deploying a small satellite and its kick stage into a 400 km parking orbit. In July 2020, an Electron rocket failed with customer payloads onboard, the first failure after the maiden flight. =Notable launches= *\\"Still Testing\\", Electron's first successful launch *ELaNa-19 \\"This One's For Pickering\\", Electron's first NASA- sponsored launch *NROL-151 \\"Birds of a Feather\\", Electron's first NRO- sponsored launch =Launch statistics=  See also  * Small-lift launch vehicle * Comparison of orbital launcher families * Comparison of orbital launch systems * Falcon 1 * Firefly Alpha * Miura 5 * Vector-R  References   External links  * Electron website at RocketLabUSA.com * Electron Payload User's Guide at RocketLabUSA.com * Category:Rocket Lab Category:Expendable space launch systems Category:Microsatellite launch vehicles Category:Space launch vehicles of New Zealand Category:Space launch vehicles of the United States Category:Vehicles introduced in 2017 Category:2017 in spaceflight ","title":"Electron (rocket)"},{"id":"43438628","text":"Narcissister is an American, Brooklyn-based, feminist performance artist, born of Moroccan Jewish and African-American descent. Narcissister's work tends to focus on race, gender, and sexuality, using her slight anonymity to explore such topics controversially. In February 2013, she headlined her first solo gallery. She was a contestant on America's Got Talent. Huffington Post declared her the \\"topless feminist superhero of New York\\". She prefers her identity remain secret. Art and performance Narcissister studied dance at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City before turning that skill into a more interdisciplinary performance. She then worked as a window stylist and designer while completing the Whitney Independent Study Program and performing at burlesque shows around New York. Most of her work tends to be very sexualized and sexually charged, dealing mostly with women and female sexuality with reoccurring uses of a merkin and items being held in bodily orifices. =Narcissister in the mainstream= In 2011, Narcissister was picked as one of the 30 young artists to recreate the various pieces—specifically the Luminosity piece—from the Marina Abramović retrospective The Artist is Present performance piece at MoMA. These pieces were all recreations of past pieces done by Abramovic throughout her career. In 2011, Narcissister was also asked to be the date of and accompany goth singer Marilyn Manson to various events in California surrounding the screening of his film Born Villain. She currently holds a residency at the downtown club and performance venue The Box Soho. =Work and collaborations= Narcisisster's use of masks and mannequins was initiated in her first public performance called, \\"The Mannequin\\". However, according to her that's the only consistent element in her work, explaining how its continuously evolving adding so many layers. Her most notable works include I'm Every Woman, a piece named after the song by Chaka Khan, in which she coined the term \\"reverse strip tease,\\" by pulling clothing out of her bodily orifices and getting dressed that way. Narcissister is also well known for her 2008 film The Self-Gratifier, a piece in which she constructs an abstract bicycle machine, connecting it to whips that whip the body as the machine is being used. The Self-Gratifier won the Best Use of a Sex Toy award at the Good Vibrations Erotic Film Festival that same year. Burka Barbie consists of an elaborate dance routine fantasy sequence and Hot Dog consists of her emerging as a wiener from a hot dog bun. Most recently she worked on a movement about women's top freedom in NYC, consisting of up to 30 women, all wearing the classic Narcissister mask walking around in their daily lives topless. This piece ended with an outside viewing of the videos at a Newsstand on Canal Street, a gallery space called Petrella’s Imports'. Another more recent work of hers is Organ Player a full length cabaret piece in which Narcissister embodies multiple parts of the body, including but not limited to the hand, the breasts, the mouth, and the vagina. Her piece Winter/Spring Collection was a collaboration with A.L. Steiner for MOCAtv. She held an exhibition in New York in 2013 called, \\"Narcissister is You\\". The exhibit showed her unedited video project where willing participants were invited to step behind her famous mask and explore her artistic process in their own way, highlighting Freud's two types of narcissism \\"primary\\" and \\"secondary\\". This exhibit included a sculpture installation as well, which invited spectators to identify with her image presented in the mirror. While attempting to get viewers to identify what it is in the \\"self\\" image that gets us to fall in love with it, it also beckons the question how can such beauty be admired in an artificially constructed subject. http://www.narcissister.com/theater/#/narcissister-is-you2/ As a side project, Narcissister also collaborates musically with the electronic and noise musician EarthMasters, and their first 10-track album, Subliminal Weight Loss, was released on October 29, 2014.  Awards and honors  In 2015 Narcissister won a Creative Capital grant for her project the Organ Player.

Sudharshan Vembutty, however, liked the script of Burma and agreed to fund the film. Dharani Dharan had plans to cast popular actors for the lead roles in Burma and met many \\"top heroes\\" but said that nobody believed in his script or that they were not interested in the project since it was not produced by a known studio. Therefore, he decided to work with newcomers and cast Michael Thangadurai and Reshmi Menon, who had both appeared in few low-profile films only, in the lead roles. Atul Kulkarni was recruited for a pivotal role, that of a \\"car financier, who appoints people to recover the car, if funds don't come on time\\", with the actor telling that he experimented with his hairdo, and got a new hair colour. According to Dharanidharan, Kulkarni and Sampath Raj, are the only two popular actors in the cast, who agreed to work for lesser remuneration than what they usually charge. Before the actual shoot began, Dharani Dharan shot every scene with Michael, on a 5D camera for one month, like a rehearsal. A luxury vehicle was needed for the film and he approached a BMW team and showed them the script, who were impressed with it and lent a BMW X6 worth 1.5 crores for the shoot. Most of the story takes place in real places in north Chennai and the team shot in highly crowded places like Royapuram, Pudhupet and Ennore, with the director stating that filming in those locations was \\"extremely challenging\\". Soundtrack Sudharshan M Kumar composed the soundtrack and film score of Burma. The audio rights were purchased by Think Music India. The lyrics were written by Kabilan Vairamuthu, Aaryan Dinesh, Tupakeys (MC Rude, MC Akram) and S.A. The album features eight tracks and was released on 28 August 2014 by C. V. Kumar at the Suryan FM 93.5 studio in Chennai along with the film's theatrical trailer. Critical reception Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"There’s so much attitude, atmosphere, flavour and wry comedy in Burma that I readily forgave the minor sins and its major one — the story takes a detour into a race-against-time thriller, and there really isn’t all that much tension. But Dharanidharan doesn’t try to pump in life artificially — everything is beautifully organic, one of a piece...Burma made me so high on how crime can entertain that I almost forgot it doesn’t pay\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"With interlinking story lines, a smartly written screenplay and slick narration, the film keeps one engaged for its crisp 96 minutes of viewing time....Burma is a rollicking, breezy roller-coaster ride\\". IANS gave it a score of 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Burma could've easily been an excellent film with its interesting premise and an equally exciting non-linear narrative...Dharani uses the narrative style of Guy Ritchie films, but what he misses out is the deft execution style of the latter...Nevertheless, Burma is still a reasonably good watch with some decent performances\\". Sify called the film a \\"decent crime-thriller\\" that was \\"quite racy and entertaining\\" but added, \\"the script is a mess. Some scenes are badly written and incoherent\\".

The Somorrostro name was forgotten and the beach became one of the most popular in the city. It was not until 2010, Somorrostro beach got its original name back.

Known during this time as a gypsy community. It was not until the 1966 visit of Spanish caudillo Francisco Franco that the slum removal began.http://www.blog.oneholidayrentals.com/somorrostro-beach/ Most all of these slums were pulled down between the 1960s and 1980s.

Prior to her death from cancer in 2010, Earl befriended author John Green, who credited her for the inspiration to complete his bestselling 2012 novel The Fault in Our Stars. In 2014, Earl's writings were compiled with her biography This Star Won't Go Out, which appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for young adult books. Earl has been cited as an influential activist, with her family and online followers continuing to hold charity and fundraising events in her memory. Early life and activism Earl was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Wayne and Lori (née Krake) Earl, one of five siblings. The Earls, whom The Boston Globe characterizes as \\"self- described wanderers\\", moved between Saudi Arabia, Massachusetts, and France. While in Massachusetts, she resided in Medway before moving with her family to North Quincy and attending North Quincy High School. In 2007, Earl met John Green, who Margaret Talbot of The New Yorker states, \\"was one of the earliest nerdfighters.\\" Initially the two maintained an online friendship, which grew from her self-identification as a Nerdfighter, a member of Nerdfighteria, the online community of Vlogbrothers fans. Earl developed her friendship with Green upon meeting him at LeakyCon 2009, a Harry Potter conference. Following the conference, she would continue in the Nerdfighter community, including her involvement with the Harry Potter Alliance (HPA) and their winning of a $250,000 grant, after Green encouraged voters to vote \\"with Esther\\" for the HPA. Earl built an online presence on platforms such as Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube.  Cancer and death  At the age of 12 in November 2006, in Marseille, Earl was diagnosed with metastasized papillary thyroid cancer. The following Thanksgiving in 2007, her parents sought a second opinion at Boston Children's Hospital. Earl's doctors informed her and her parents that her cancer was terminal. She continued her online community activities until her death due to thyroid cancer on August 25, 2010. John Green, saddened by Earl's death, dedicated a eulogy in vlog format titled, Rest in Awesome, Esther. Earl's YouTube videos remained available for streaming following her death. Legacy Esther Earl doing the \\"Nerdfighter salute\\" Following her passing, Earl inspired communities she participated in such as Nerdfighteria and the Harry Potter Alliance. She inspired two books, \\"Esther Day\\", as well as the founding of a nonprofit organization. In 2014, after the release of the film adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars, and Esther's novel, Esther's parents spoke at Wallace State Community College, as well as the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute about the legacy which Esther left behind. In 2015, Alba, a Quincy restaurant, held a Summer Gala fundraising event in her honor. =Esther Day= Shortly before her death, Green uploaded I Love Hank: Esther Day 2010. The video was uploaded in celebration of \\"Esther Day\\", a day which Earl stated she wanted to be about \\"family and love.\\" Esther Day is celebrated annually on August 3, coinciding with Esther's birthday. Green has stated Earl was the one to suggest \\"the idea of celebrating friends and family and love,\\" specifically, \\"the kinds of love that are too often overlooked in our culture: love among friends and family.\\" In 2014, bookstores around the United States celebrated Esther Day. Additionally, Green has called Esther Day, \\"the most important holiday in Nerdfighteria.\\" =This Star Won't Go Out= Following her death, Earl's parents, Wayne and Lori founded This Star Won't Go Out, a non profit organization which helps families that have cancer-stricken children. To assist the organization, the VlogBrothers donate proceeds from TSWGO merchandise sold on DFTBA.com. Earl's biography, co-authored by her parents, was posthumously published under the title This Star Won't Go Out: The Life and Words of Esther Grace Earl. Green wrote the introduction. The book was inspired by a promise between Earl and her father: whoever outlived the other would write about the other. The book includes a collection of her journals and drawings. =The Fault in Our Stars= Esther Earl inspired the character Hazel Grace Lancaster in Green's 2012 novel, The Fault in Our Stars, as well as its 2014 film adaptation. Shailene Woodley portrayed Lancaster in the novel's film adaptation. Although Earl inspired the novel and the character of Hazel Grace, the novel is not intended to be biographical. Green dedicated the novel to Esther but also found inspiration through others, including his son and wife, as well as his experience as a children's hospital chaplain. Green wrote on his Tumblr blog, \\"I don’t want people conflating Esther with Hazel (they’re very different), and it’s extremely important to me that I not claim to be telling Esther’s story.\\" References External links *This Star Won't Go Out (TSWGO) Official Website *Esther Earl's YouTube account *Esther Day 2013 video by the VlogBrothers *USA Today video story on Esther Earl's life * Category:1994 births Category:2010 deaths Category:21st-century American writers Category:American community activists Category:American expatriates in France Category:American expatriates in Saudi Arabia Category:American women bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:American women writers Category:American YouTubers Category:Deaths from cancer in Massachusetts Category:Deaths from thyroid cancer Category:Internet activists category:North Quincy High School alumni Category:People from Beverly, Massachusetts Category:Video bloggers Category:Women video bloggers Category:Writers from Boston Category:Writers from Quincy, Massachusetts ","title":"Esther Earl"},{"id":"43438972","text":"Robert (Bob) Montgomery McDowall (15 September 1939 – 20 February 2011) was one of New Zealand's most prominent freshwater ichthyologists. Biography McDowall was born on 15 September 1939, the son of dairy scientist Frederick Henry McDowall and entomologist Grace Edith Wall. He attended Palmerston North Boys' High School and went on to study for a BSc at Victoria University in 1958. Despite only receiving a C pass in Zoology, he was accepted into the graduate program where he completed an MSc thesis on the biology of the redfin bully. In 1963 he joined the Fisheries Division of the Marine Department of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. At that time, the main laboratories of the Marine Department were housed on the ground floor of the old Wellington City morgue - which McDowall described as an \\"unhappy and \\"exceedingly primitive' place with inadequate power and heating. McDowall's dissatisfaction at the Fisheries Division reached Barry Fell, formerly a professor at Victoria University and then working at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Fell encouraged McDowall to apply to Harvard and supported his entry. Conveniently, McDowall was then awarded a National Research Fellowship with the condition that he study overseas. He left New Zealand on a small cargo ship with an \\"entry permit to the United States and Harvard, a good scholarship, an extensive fish collection and a wife of 10 days.\\" There he studied the taxonomy of the galaxiid fishes. His PhD thesis on the systematics and phylogeny of the New Zealand whitebait was praised as one of the best submitted at the time. He returned to New Zealand and the Fisheries Division in 1968, where he was supposed to be working on the diet of trout. Quietly, he resumed his galaxiid studies, focusing on the ecology of the whitebait species. In 1978 he moved to Christchurch to run the expanding Christchurch freshwater fisheries laboratory, and was promoted to Assistant Director (Freshwater) in 1983. In this role he managed 60 staff around New Zealand, which restricted his research opportunities. Nevertheless, he continued to work on the biology and biogeography of native fishes. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1984, as his father had been in 1962. During his scientific career, McDowall wrote 14 books, as well as 230 papers in 66 different journals. His last book, Ikawai: freshwater fishes in Māori culture and economy, was published in October 2011 following his death on 20 February 2011. He was posthumously awarded the Le Cren Medal by the Fisheries Society of the British Isles in 2011.

They were inspired to create the company by the Chernobyl disaster where many of the firemen and engineers, who were first on the scene, died from high doses of gamma radiation in an illness known as Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation sickness.

This technology was designed to increase whole-body protection, particularly to the head, while providing physicians relatively free-range motion capabilities while operating. For ergonomic relief, the StemRad MD system uses a proprietary exoskeleton system that transfers the system's shielding weight to the floor, reducing the possibilities of musculoskeletal strain. The protective ensemble consists of four main parts: a protective apron, a protective visor, a thyroid collar, and an exoskeletal system. The protective apron is of a state-of-the-art bismuth-antimony bilayer composition and offers 0.5mm lead-equivalent protection with a small overlap area of 1mm in the front. The visor is made up of a transparent lead-acrylic material and is designed to provide full head and eye protection, areas that are many times exposed in users of standard lead apron solutions. It is positioned at an angle so that it blocks most of the radiation coming from underneath and allows the physician to wear unshielded prescription glasses while performing procedures. The thyroid collar is unique in the sense that it is integrated into the protective apron component and is flush with the bottom side of the protective visor.

Poblacion I in Marilao, Bulacan. In 1997, a historical marker bearing the brief history of the church was installed by the National Historical Institute, precursor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. History Prior to the construction of the present church of masonry, a previous chapel (locally called bisitang matanda) annexed to the parish of Meycauayan was established by Fr. Vicente de Talavera in 1796 on a nearby site, namely Tawiran. The present church was finished on April 21, 1868 under the supervision of the Franciscan Friars. The church became a casualty of the Philippine Revolution when it was gutted by fire in 1896. The church was transferred to the secular priests of the Archdiocese of Manila after the Philippine–American War and the expulsion of all regular friars. In 1961 it was transferred to the Diocese of Malolos. The church structure has undergone significant reconstruction in the years 1922 and 1967. On 8 May 2018, feast day of St Michael the archangel, The late Malolos Bishop Jose F. Oliveros celebrated one of his final masses in the parish 3 days before his death Architecture Image of Saint Michael enshrined at the main retablo with the relic from his 492 Apparition in Italy The church façade is reminiscent of a typical Philippine Barn-Style Baroque church architecture, with its two levels and triangular pediment. The main portal, now with an attached concrete canopy, is flanked by niches of Saint Peter and Paul. The second level has three openings and is devoid of any intricate embellishment save for the pilasters rising to the bottom of the pediment, panels with embossed eye-shaped details and reliefs of heart sand the Franciscan seal. The four pilasters that rise from the first level to the base of the pediment are topped not by finial caps but by four statues that of the four evangelists. On the center of the pediment is an ornate niche with a statue of Saint Michael. The pediment's edge is decorated by a raking cornice which tapers down to the two ends with scrolls. To the right of the façade is the two-storey octagonal bell tower which falls directly behind the façade and sits atop one of the two rectangular buttresses framing the façade. The belfry's first level is adorned with blind windows with balustrade on all sides. The top level has alternating blind and open windows and is capped with a cone. Relic of the Apparition of Saint Michael Located at the foot of the image of Saint Michael on the main retablo is a relic of the Apparition of Saint Michael in Italy. Recalling the history of the said apparition, a herdsman named Gargan was pasturing his heard in the area when a bull wandered off into the mountains and went inside a cave. After locating the cave where the bull sought refuge, a man shot an arrow inside the cave but mysteriously bounced back and shot the one who released the arrow. With the puzzling event, the people sought the help of the local bishop. It is said the Saint Michael presented himself to the bishop and ordered the cave to be consecrated under his name. It is now known as the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo. Relics associated with the said apparition, such as that found inside this church, may have been rocks chipped off from the cave or pieces of cloth that has touched it.

The museum occupies part of Pier 21, the former ocean liner terminal and immigration shed from 1928 to 1971. Pier 21 is Canada's last remaining ocean immigration shed. The facility is often compared to Ellis Island (1892–1954), in terms of its importance to mid-20th- century immigration to Canada an association it shares with 19th century immigration history at Grosse Isle, Quebec (1832–1932) and Partridge Island in Saint John, New Brunswick (1785–1941). The Museum began as an independent institution run by the Pier 21 Society in 1999. It became a national museum run by the Canadian federal government in 2011. History The Museum is located in the former Pier 21 immigration facility built in 1928 as part of the Ocean Terminals development in Halifax. The Pier played a crucial role in World War II and in the peak years of postwar immigration to Canada in the 1940s and 50s. Pier 21 closed as an immigration terminal in 1971. From the 1970s until 1991, Pier 21 housed the Nova Scotia Nautical Institute, a training facility for professional mariners. During the 1990s, the former immigration quarters provided studio and workshop space for artists.Schwinghamer, Steven. \\"Historic Pier 21\\". Web blog entry accessed 2 April 2016. The ocean liner pier itself became increasingly used as the Halifax Port Authority's cruise ship dock. On September 22, 1997, the site was designated a National Historic Site by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. =Pier 21 Society Museum= Part of the exhibition in 2007 In 1990, the Pier 21 Society was co-founded by J.P. LeBlanc and Ruth Goldbloom to raise funds and renew the public's interest in the derelict shed, which was the last of its kind in Canada. Goldbloom became the organization's second president in 1993, and the push to turn the property into a National Historic Site and museum proceeded quickly. In cooperation with the Halifax Port Authority, Pier 21 was re-opened as a museum on Canada Day in 1999, and began its new role to celebrate the 1.5 million immigrants that passed through its doors. =National Museum= In 2009, the Government of Canada, the Pier 21 Society, the Pier 21 Foundation and the Halifax Port Authority agreed to partner in support of a new national museum at Pier 21. On June 25, 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced a Statement of Intentions to designate a National Museum of Immigration at Pier 21. Later that year, Pier 21 was chosen to compete in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) \\"Seven Wonders of Canada\\" television show, placing out of the top seven places. As the sixth national museum in Canada—and only the second national museum outside of Canada's National Capital Region—Pier 21 joined Canada's five other national museums officially on February 7, 2011. The Museum was voted bronze for Best Museum by readers of The Coast from 2012 to 2015. Permanent exhibitions = The Pier 21 Story = The Pier 21 Story exhibition shows visitors what it was like to immigrate through Pier 21 between 1928 and 1971. Visitors can open replica children's trunks to see what five immigrant children might have brought with them to Canada, walk through a replica of the colonist train cars that newly arrived immigrants boarded for the next stage of their journey, and even dress up as some of the key staff and volunteers at Pier 21.

A multimedia immigration map allows visitors to visualize migration trends. The BMO Oral History Gallery includes almost 200 oral histories that visitors can browse by theme. The exhibit is divided into four sections: Journey, Arrival, Belonging, and Impact. Pier 21: Bigger and better than ever, Chronicle Herald, Joel Jacobsen, September 28, 2015 =Temporary exhibitions= Empress of Ireland: Canada's Titanic is a temporary exhibition from November 23, 2015, to November 13, 2016. It was created by the Canadian Museum of History and co- presented by the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21. The exhibit tells the story of the thousands of passengers who took the RMS Empress of Ireland to and from Canada and Great Britain and its subsequent maritime disaster on 29 May 1914 that saw it sink after a collision with the Norwegian collier SS Storstad. =Wall of Service= CP01 Herman Heppell, HMCS Bonaventure, on the Wall of Service The Wall of Service commemorates Pier 21 as the departure point for over 500,000 Canadians during the Second World War. The wall recognizes the sacrifices of service personnel past and present, war brides, and individuals who have provided service at Pier 21. Bricks are purchased on behalf of a designate and displayed on the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21's WWII Deck as well as on the Virtual Wall of Service. =The Sobey Wall of Honour= The Sobey Wall of Honour gives tribute to individuals who have chosen Canada as their home and have helped build Canada as a nation. It is supported by the Sobey Foundation. Bricks are purchased on behalf of a designate and displayed in the entrance to the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21. =Wadih M. Fares Wall of Tribute= The Wadih M. Fares Wall of Tribute recognizes community and cultural groups with a connection to Pier 21 and immigration to Canada. Bricks are purchased by community and cultural groups and displayed in the Hall of Tribute at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21. The wall is named after Wadih M. Fares, an immigrant to Canada from Lebanon in 1976 and Chair of the Board at Pier 21 from 2007 to 2009.  Collection  The Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 has both a physical artifact collection and a vast Oral History collection. Pier 21 currently holds 2,000 stories, 500 oral history interviews, 700 donated books, 300 films, and thousands of archival images and scans of immigration and WWII documents. Many of the resources can be found on the website and all can be accessed by contacting Pier 21's Scotiabank Family History Centre. The Pier 21 story collection has broadened from those who actually passed through Pier 21's doors, to include stories about immigration from all points of entry from the early beginnings of Canada (including First Nations) and concentrating on all immigration from 1867 to the present. Pier 21 is collecting family histories that go back to 1867 and is eager to begin collecting stories from those that arrived after 1971. These stories will be among the raw materials used to create future exhibits. Oral historians conduct oral history interviews onsite and occasionally in different centres across Canada. These interviews are vital to the Museum's collection and its ongoing commitment to preserving and sharing stories of all Canadians. The image collection includes thousands of scanned newspaper clippings, immigration related documents and ship memorabilia, as well as digital photos donated by individual families and organizations. The museum actively collects donated personal and family stories on immigration to Canada to add to the Museum's Story Collection. =MS St. Louis memorial= On January 20, 2011, a memorial sculpture, the \\"Wheel of Conscience\\", was displayed at Pier 21. It commemorated the German passenger liner MS St. Louiss 1939 voyage from Europe to North America. Over 900 Jewish passengers, fleeing the early stages of the Holocaust, were turned away as refugees from many North American ports. A quarter died in the Holocaust. Designed by Daniel Libeskind with graphic design by David Berman and Trevor Johnston, it was produced by the Canadian Jewish Congress. The memorial is a polished stainless steel wheel. Symbolizing the hateful and racist policies that turned away more than 900 Jewish refugees, the wheel incorporates four gears of descending size named to represent the process that led to the denial of sanctuary - antisemitism, xenophobia, racism, and then hatred. On the back of the memorial is a list of the passengers aboard the MS St. Louis. After an initial display period, the sculpture was shipped to its fabricators, Soheil Mosun Limited, in Toronto for repair and refurbishment. As of the museum re-opening in the spring of 2015, the memorial is back in place in the main lobby of the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21.\\"Exhibitions\\", Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 Programs and services =Research and genealogy services = The Scotiabank Family History Centre (SFHC), located on the main floor of the museum, houses a large, publicly available collection of non-circulating books, periodicals, and archival records related to the Pier 21 National Historic Site and the broader study of immigration in Canada, with a focus on the role that immigrants and their descendants have had in shaping Canadian life.

Considering one of the world's top Greco-Roman wrestlers in his decade, Jablonski has yielded a remarkable tally of five career medals, including his prestigious gold from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships, and later represented as part of the Polish team in three editions of the Olympic Games (1996, 2000, and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Jablonski trained for Cement Gryf Wrestling Club in Chełm, under his personal coaches Krzysztof Grabczuk and 1988 Olympic silver medalist Andrzej Głąb. Jablonski made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he competed in the men's flyweight division (52 kg). He pinned Romania's Valentin Rebegea in the opening bout, before losing his next match 0–8 to Russia's Samvel Danielyan. Entering the repechage rounds, Jablonski wrestled his way to successfully defeat Dominican Republic's Ulises Valentin with another pin and South Korea's Ha Tae-yeon with a rigid 3–2 decision. He fell behind Ukraine's Andriy Kalashnykov in the fifth round 5–8, and had an astounding 2–3 upset from Ha in their rematch for seventh place, dropping Jablonski to eighth. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Jablonski qualified for his second Polish squad in the men's bantamweight division (54 kg). Unlike his previous Olympics, Jablonski undermined his gaming strategy in the prelim pool. He lost his opening match to eventual Olympic champion Sim Kwon-ho of South Korea on technical superiority and was wretchedly pinned by Kazakhstan's Rakymzhan Assembekov, leaving him on the bottom of the pool and placing penultimate out of 22 wrestlers in the final standings. Shortly after the Games, Jablonski regained his form and came powerful with two bronze medals in the bantamweight division at the European Championships. Upon entering the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Créteil, France, Jablonski ousted South Korea's Im Dae-won on his final match to capture the featherweight title and guarantee a spot on the Polish Olympic team. Determined to return to the Olympic scene and medal, Jablonski arrived at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens on his third stint, as a 31-year-old veteran, in the men's 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, he won a gold medal over South Korea's Im at the World Championships. Jablonski lost his opening match to eventual Olympic silver medalist Geidar Mamedaliyev of Russia by a 3–0 verdict, but sailed smoothly to turn down India's Mukesh Khatri on the mat with an identical margin during the prelim pool round. Finishing second in the pool and fifteenth overall, Jablonski's performance was not enough to advance him to the quarterfinals.

He is sometimes referred to as Abdel Kader Baba Laddé.  Biography  He was born on July 21, 1970 in Gounou Gaya in Mayo-Kebbi East and is of Fulani ethnicity. Gendarme, he went into rebellion on October 15, 1998 by founding an armed group, the Popular Front for Recovery (PFR). He was imprisoned for the first time from November 1998 to September 1999. He then took refuge in Nigeria for several years. He joined Darfur with his PFR fighters from 2006 to 2008 alongside other rebel groups. For a few months, he was the Defense Commissioner of the Forces unies pour le changement (FUC) coalition, the coalition bringing together most of these groups. In 2008, he joined the Central African Republic with his men. He was arrested by Chadian forces in Bangui in 2009 while taking part in negotiations, but imprisoned in N'Djamena, he managed to escape in 2010. On December 23, 2011, in an article entitled \\"Central African Republic: Laddé, the man who wants to liberate the Peuls\\", the newspaper Jeune Afrique affirms that Baba Laddé wants to unite the Fulani movements with AQIM, the Polisario Front, the Tuaregs and the separatists of the Ogaden. However, it could be a disinformation campaign to discredit the Chadian opposition. On January 23, 2012, Chadian and Central African armies launched an offensive against his bases located near Kaga-Bandoro, Kabo, Ouandago, Gondava (north-central Central African Republic), causing losses among PFR rebels, civilians and military from both countries. Baba Laddé and most of his men then left the area. The Guardian claims on March 7, 2012 that 16,000 people have been displaced as a result of these clashes, in May the United Nations mentions of 22,000 displaced. According to researcher Roland Marchal, “What is different is the fact that he (Baba Laddé) was able to have a political discourse that was not confined within the borders of the Central African Republic, and within the localist claims. He developed an argument on the marginalization of Fulani Bororos pastoralists.\\" In an interview with Radio France Internationale on February 28, 2012, Baba Laddé affirms that his new objective is to overthrow the Chadian and Central African regimes. At that moment, the Romanian mercenary Horațiu Potra, a former legionary, offered to help him. On March 16, 2012, Pierre Buyoya, former president of Burundi, affirmed “As for Baba Laddé, we have known for a long time that he is a bandit, a coupeur de route. I am surprised to see that he now has political demands. Is he manipulated? Maybe.\\" According to The Huffington Post of April 20, 2012 and Human Rights Watch, Baba Laddé and his men were on that date in the south-east of the Central African Republic, in the area where the Lord's Resistance Army is operating. On June 1, 2012, Baba Laddé told Radio France Internationale that he was in South Sudan. He settled in Boro Madina (or Boro Medina) in the state of Western Bahr el Ghazal, in Raga county. On July 23, 2012, Idriss Déby told Jeune Afrique that Baba Laddé \\"is a former Chadian gendarme who became a coupeur de route and trafficker in ivory, he is not a rebel, as some media claim, but a great bandit. This kind of character does not constitute a threat to Chad. For the Central African Republic, maybe.\\" On August 14, 2012, François Bozizé reaffirmed to Radio France Internationale that Baba Laddé was in South Sudan. On September 2, 2012, Baba Laddé surrendered to the Central African authorities in the town of Ippy after announcing a few days before his return to the Central African Republic that he wanted to negotiate with the Chadian and Central African governments. He was officially welcomed in Bangui on September 3, then a United Nations plane transferred him to N'Djamena on September 5. On September 8, the communiqué of agreement signifying the surrender of Baba Laddé was signed by the ministers of the interior and of defense of Chad and the Central African Republic. On January 15, 2013, he was appointed advisor in charge of mission in the cabinet of the head of government of Chad. In conflict with the Prime Minister, he went into exile in Nigeria then in Niger in September 2013. He traveled to Benin then to Kenya where he met Jean-Francis Bozizé (son of François Bozizé) in Nairobi in November, then Joachim Kokaté in Niamey. After negotiations, the Nigerian Toubou Goukouni Zen and the Central African of Séléka Abakar Sabon brought Baba Laddé back to Chad at the end of January 2014. On July 19, 2014 he was appointed prefect of the department of Grande Sido. On November 24, 2014, like most prefects and sub-prefects of Chadian departments, Baba Laddé was dismissed from his post by decree. But having invested a lot in his department, the population of Maro is opposed to his eviction. A military convoy picks him up on December 1st, but he escapes while his wife and bodyguard are beaten. He was then reported on December 5th in Bateldjé, in the Central African Republic between Kabo and Batangafo, where his men would have killed five civilians, a Central African minister affirmed on December 8 that Baba Laddé's presence in the Central African republic is for the moment only a rumor, but on December 10, the United Nations announces that the rebel leader was arrested on December 8 in Kabo by MINUSCA and transferred to Bangui. On the 11th, a former minister, Sheikh Aboulanwar Mahamat Djarma Khatir gave his support to Baba Laddé. He was extradited to Chad on January 2, 2015 and imprisoned in the prison of Koro Toro. In the Central African crisis that began at the end of 2012, some of the RPF fighters joined the Séléka, mainly under the command of Ali Darassa, former right-hand man of Baba Laddé and now at the head of his own Fulani militia, the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic. On December 6, 2018, the N'Djamena Court of Appeal sentenced him to 8 years' imprisonment. After serving his sentence in Koro Toro, then at Amsinéné prison in N'Djamena, he was transferred in 2019 to Moussoro. His prison term ends on January 5, 2020, but he is not released until September 7, 2020.

The church is one of the ten Anglican chaplaincies in Switzerland that have a resident chaplain (minister) and together form the Archdeaconry of Switzerland.Archdeaconry of Switzerland home page (Accessed 31 July 2014) St Ursula’s has a long tradition of ministry to all English-speaking people in the Canton of Bern and beyond. It also provides a home for Christians from many different denominations and cultural backgrounds. History = 19th Century = Between 1832 and 1847, the Chaplain from Christ Church, Lausanne held 21 services in Bern at the invitation of the British minister. These were probably held at the British Legation.Paul W Schniewind Anglicans in Switzerland Past and Present - Texte der Evangelischen Arbeitsstelle Oekumene Schweiz 17 (1992) Hoteliers throughout Switzerland were eager to offer facilities for worship. In 1845, the Bernese authorities gave permission for English services to be held in the chapel of the Bürgerspital. A group of innkeepers undertook to pay the cost of bringing a chaplain from England. Twelve years later, the former deer-park outside the city walls was sold for redevelopment. The Cantonal Forestry department made a grant of land at the top of Hirschengraben for building an English church. Plans were drawn up in 1858 by the influential English architect, George Edmund Street, but although the community raised Fr 8454.50 towards the construction, this was not enough, and the grant was revoked. In 1859, the Colonial and Continental Church Society undertook to support a chaplain in Bern. In 1887, funding was taken over by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Services were held for a while in the Old Catholic church of St Peter and St Paul, but there were complications due to the bitterness felt by Roman Catholics against the Old Catholic movement, which spilled over into the diplomatic field. It was fortunate that the congregation moved in 1887 to the hall of the Lerber School (now the Freies Gymnasium) in Nageligasse. The city authorities offered St Anthony's Chapel (the Antonierkirche in Postgasse, at the time being used as a fire brigade storehouse) to the Anglican church in 1889. The architect Reginald Blomfield (best remembered today as architect of the Menin Gate in Ypres) reported favourably on the opportunity. Despite the enthusiasm of the proprietor of the Hotel Bernerhof, and of Bishop Wilkinson, the offer failed for lack of financial support. Permission was given for services to be held in the Cathedral (or, if service times clashed, in the French church), but the church did not act on this offer. Services continued to be held in the Lerberschule. = Construction = Bern began to expand on the other side of the River Aare, and in 1881, the English-Bern Land Company bought the area of Kirchenfeld, getting permission to develop it on condition that they build a bridge spanning the Aare to link it to the city centre. At their meeting on 14 June 1904, the Directors, \\"being very anxious to meet the wishes of the promoters of the Church\\", offered a central site in their development at Jubiläumsplatz on condition that money for funding a church be provided by the end of 1905. An appeal fund had already been set up. However, by July 1904, only Fr 13318.50 of the hoped-for Fr 25000 had been raised. An intensive campaign was launched to raise the remainder, which was reckoned as the equivalent of £468, a considerable sum at the time. (Prospective donors were reminded that \\"the few resident English people pay for a clergyman which costs them £95 per annum, and cannot do more.\\") A wealthy American episcopalian, Mrs John Castleman from St Louis, Missouri, came to Bern with her adopted daughter, who was to have an operation at the clinic of Dr Theodor Kocher. There she met the mother of the then Chaplain, Gilbert Sissons, who was having a similar operation. Both made near-miraculous recoveries, and as a thank offering, Mrs Castleman donated a large sum for the building of the church. The application for building permission was published by the \\"English-American Church\\" in November 1905 and the land was transferred to the SPG on 16 January 1906. The church was designed to seat a hundred people. It was completed in only a few months, and was ready in the spring of 1906. The architects were Eduard Rybi and Ernst Salchli. The church was consecrated on Thursday, 20 September 1906 by the Coadjutor Bishop for North and Central Europe, Thomas Edward Wilkinson, in the presence of Ludwig Forrer, the President of the Confederation, and of Sir George Bonham, the British Minister to Switzerland. Maintaining the church represented a considerable expense for members of the congregation. Funds were also established for an \\"east\\" window, dedicated by Bishop Herbert Bury in memory of Cecil Bonham at the end of 1911. There was a bell fund, and a fence fund (for one of the conditions on which the land was given was the construction of a substantial fence, which was to cost Fr. 5000). A fund was also established to buy a permanent house for the chaplain. Richard Pring, writing in 1912, remarked that even when the new Lötschberg railway had been opened, and the Bellevue and Schweizerhof Hotels reopened, the chaplain's income was unlikely to exceed £130 or £150 a year, \\"and that, without a house, especially for a married man, is totally inadequate.\\" He hoped that a house would soon be built, so that \\"Berne may no longer be looked upon as quite one of most underpaid chaplaincies on the Continent.\\" St Ursula's Church, Berne, Switzerland – Anglicans in Bern – 1832 to the present (Accessed 31 July 2014) In 1914, the church received a grant of Fr 1752.30 from SPG, and 29 individual subscriptions added Fr 1690. Collections totalled Fr 3079.70. Out of this, the church had to fund the chaplain's stipend, which amounted to Fr 4432.50 (the equivalent then of £180). The remainder went to pay the cleaner, the gardener, and the expenses of running the church. The chaplain at the time lived in the Pension Herter in Kramgasse. Although a Vicarage Fund existed (amounting in 1914 to Fr 435 (or £17)), successive chaplains found their own accommodation up until 1956 (latterly at Kirchenfeldstrasse 50, adjacent to the church). The Bell Fund and the Sanctuary Fund were regarded as more important. (The bell was cast in 1918 by the firm of Rüetschi in Aarau.) = The last 100 years = During the First World War, the church was sometimes filled to overflowing. However, in the interwar years, the congregation seldom exceeded 30, and consisted largely of Anglo-Swiss families, with a small representation from the diplomatic community. (A notable event was in 1922, when General Booth of the Salvation Army visited.) The permanent English-speaking population of Bern was relatively small between the wars. As part of the Coronation celebrations in 1953, the church community had already started an ambitious campaign to raise Fr 120000 to build a hall and adjacent house for the chaplain. The city architectural department gave support and advice, but part of the plan involved the city's education department using the hall during the week. This was contrary to the covenants which the Bern Land Company had given the church's neighbours when the church was originally built, that the land would only be used for a church. After a public inquiry, the city withdrew its plans to use the hall, and permission was given. Preliminary building work was completed in 1956, but the final structure was only finished in January 1960. After the evening service on Tuesday, 21 September 1976, an electric heater was left on. At 6.45 the next day, the organ burst into flames, and although the fire brigade was called promptly, the damage was considerable. A change in tax legislation in 1991 made a windfall sum available for additional building work. As a result, the church hall was extended in 1992-4, and other church buildings were improved. A focus for English-speaking Christians St Ursula's is a strongly ecumenical church, and this is reflected in its membership. St Ursula's is also a member of the Council of Churches in Bern. Worship is an important priority. Around 80 people come to the main Eucharist service at 10.00 on Sunday mornings. Services follow the Church of England's Common Worship Order One. The main service on the second Sunday of the month is more informal, aiming to cater for a wider range of people. Outreach, prayer, study and pastoral care form other important parts of the ministry, as well as support the work of Christ through a charity and mission team. There is a Junior Church and an active Youth Group.

Cast  * Adnan Novo (as Damir) * Sanja Popovic (as Jelena) * Seda Eğridere * Dina Ganic * Sara Stambol * Sacha Ferer Gonzales Background Work on Seasons of War commenced in 2014. The film's plot was conceived by director Seda Eğridere while she was traveling in the Balkans and Bulgaria to research the history of her family during the 1950s through 1970s. Drawing parallels between her family experience and the experiences of local Sarajevans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Seda Eğridere wrote the script for Seasons of War with writing partner Mark Harley. The script is based on true events of the Bosnian War. Production Production took place in Sarajevo over the course of three weeks in July 2014. Eğridere cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom had lived through the war and were therefore able to incorporate their experiences into their performances. Film production was delayed due to the 2014 Southeast Europe floods. In response to the tragedy, Eğridere called on fans via Twitter and Facebook to aid in flood relief by donating funds through the film's Indiegogo campaign. Before production started, comparisons were drawn between Seasons of War and Angelina Jolie's directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey. In response to these comparisons, Eğridere conveyed that she respected Jolie's film and her work as both a director and scriptwriter, but stressed that Seasons of War was a completely different story; not a war film, but rather a film about a couple and the difficult choices they were forced to make.  Soundtrack  The complete soundtrack of Seasons of War was arranged by Yasin Aydın and Kemal Eren of the Turkish rock band PUL, with which Eğridere had collaborated on a music video in 2012.

While classic F1 races can't be recreated this year, the career mode is a far more diverse and enjoyable experience. The racing action is more intense than ever before, leading this to be one of most enjoyable F1 games ever created.\\" PC Gamer rated the game 67 out of 100, concluding that \\"With its fundamentals unchanged and last years foray into classic cars removed, F1 2014 provides very little beyond a perfunctory car and track update.\\" They criticised the lack of new major features, sarcastically commenting that \\"on the back of F1 2014's box under 'new features', there may as well be a picture of a man shrugging apologetically\\".

The tunnel runs from the western approaches to Zürich Hauptbahnhof railway station, east under the station and city centre before turning north and surfacing on the southern approach to Zürich Oerlikon railway station, and allows trains running between east and west to pass through Zürich without reversal. It includes a new set of underground platforms at Zürich Hauptbahnhof, and carries twin standard gauge () tracks electrified at 15 kV AC 16 2/3 Hz using overhead catenary. The tunnel was opened on 14 June 2014, and forms part of the Altstetten–Zürich–Oerlikon cross-city line, also known as the Durchmesserlinie Zürich, which also includes new elevated approach tracks from Altstetten to Zürich Hauptbahnhof, and the rebuilding of Oerlikon station with two additional tracks and platforms. At Zürich Hauptbahnhof, the tunnel serves a pair of underground island platforms, with four platform tracks, numbered as Hauptbahnhof tracks 31 to 34 but sometimes referred to as Löwenstrasse station. These platforms are linked to the station's other platforms and facilities, both underground and surface, by a complex of subways and shopping malls. The Weinberg Tunnel is one of three different routes from Oerlikon to Hauptbahnhof, each of which tunnels through the intermediate ridge. Unlike the Weinberg Tunnel, the other two, the Wipkingen Tunnel and the Käferberg Tunnel, both connect to the Hauptbahnhof's western approaches. All three tunnels emerge from adjacent portals to the south of Oerlikon station. The tunnel is used by both long-distance passenger trains and by suburban trains on Zürich S-Bahn lines S2, S8 and S14. From December 2015, when the full Altstetten–Zürich–Oerlikon cross-city line is planned to open, it is expected that the line will be served by 460 trains per day, comprising 320 S-Bahn services and 140 long-distance services. Along its route, the Weinberg tunnel passes under several other tunnels, including the Hirschengraben rail tunnel that links Zürich Hauptbahnhof and Zürich Stadelhofen stations, the now disused Letten rail tunnel, and the Milchbuck road tunnel.

The p-group generation algorithm by M. F. Newman and E. A. O'Brien is a recursive process for constructing the descendant tree of an assigned finite p-group which is taken as the root of the tree. Lower exponent-p central series For a finite p-group G, the lower exponent-p central series (briefly lower p-central series) of G is a descending series (P_j(G))_{j\\\\ge 0} of characteristic subgroups of G, defined recursively by (1)\\\\qquad P_0(G):=G and P_j(G):=\\\\lbrack P_{j-1}(G),G\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot P_{j-1}(G)^p, for j\\\\ge 1. Since any non-trivial finite p-group G>1 is nilpotent, there exists an integer c\\\\ge 1 such that P_{c-1}(G)>P_c(G)=1 and \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G):=c is called the exponent-p class (briefly p-class) of G. Only the trivial group 1 has \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(1)=0. Generally, for any finite p-group G, its p-class can be defined as \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G):=\\\\min\\\\lbrace c\\\\ge 0\\\\mid P_c(G)=1\\\\rbrace. The complete lower p-central series of G is therefore given by (2)\\\\qquad G=P_0(G)>\\\\Phi(G)=P_1(G)>P_2(G)>\\\\cdots>P_{c-1}(G)>P_c(G)=1, since P_1(G)=\\\\lbrack P_0(G),G\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot P_0(G)^p=\\\\lbrack G,G\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot G^p=\\\\Phi(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. For the convenience of the reader and for pointing out the shifted numeration, we recall that the (usual) lower central series of G is also a descending series (\\\\gamma_j(G))_{j\\\\ge 1} of characteristic subgroups of G, defined recursively by (3)\\\\qquad \\\\gamma_1(G):=G and \\\\gamma_j(G):=\\\\lbrack\\\\gamma_{j-1}(G),G\\\\rbrack, for j\\\\ge 2. As above, for any non-trivial finite p-group G>1, there exists an integer c\\\\ge 1 such that \\\\gamma_c(G)>\\\\gamma_{c+1}(G)=1 and \\\\mathrm{cl}(G):=c is called the nilpotency class of G, whereas c+1 is called the index of nilpotency of G. Only the trivial group 1 has \\\\mathrm{cl}(1)=0. The complete lower central series of G is given by (4)\\\\qquad G=\\\\gamma_1(G)>G^{\\\\prime}=\\\\gamma_2(G)>\\\\gamma_3(G)>\\\\cdots>\\\\gamma_c(G)>\\\\gamma_{c+1}(G)=1, since \\\\gamma_2(G)=\\\\lbrack\\\\gamma_1(G),G\\\\rbrack=\\\\lbrack G,G\\\\rbrack=G^{\\\\prime} is the commutator subgroup or derived subgroup of G. The following Rules should be remembered for the exponent-p class: Let G be a finite p-group. :# Rule: \\\\mathrm{cl}(G)\\\\le\\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G), since the \\\\gamma_j(G) descend more quickly than the P_j(G). :# Rule: If \\\\vartheta\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Hom}(G,\\\\tilde{G}), for some group \\\\tilde{G}, then \\\\vartheta(P_j(G))=P_j(\\\\vartheta(G)), for any j\\\\ge 0. :# Rule: For any c\\\\ge 0, the conditions N\\\\triangleleft G and \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G/N)=c imply P_c(G)\\\\le N. :# Rule: Let c\\\\ge 0.

Parents and descendant trees The parent \\\\pi(G) of a finite non-trivial p-group G>1 with exponent-p class \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G)=c\\\\ge 1 is defined as the quotient \\\\pi(G):=G/P_{c-1}(G) of G by the last non-trivial term P_{c-1}(G)>1 of the lower exponent-p central series of G. Conversely, in this case, G is called an immediate descendant of \\\\pi(G). The p-classes of parent and immediate descendant are connected by \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G)=\\\\mathrm{cl}_p(\\\\pi(G))+1. A descendant tree is a hierarchical structure for visualizing parent-descendant relations between isomorphism classes of finite p-groups. The vertices of a descendant tree are isomorphism classes of finite p-groups. However, a vertex will always be labelled by selecting a representative of the corresponding isomorphism class. Whenever a vertex \\\\pi(G) is the parent of a vertex G a directed edge of the descendant tree is defined by G\\\\to\\\\pi(G) in the direction of the canonical projection \\\\pi:G\\\\to\\\\pi(G) onto the quotient \\\\pi(G)=G/P_{c-1}(G). In a descendant tree, the concepts of parents and immediate descendants can be generalized. A vertex R is a descendant of a vertex P, and P is an ancestor of R, if either R is equal to P or there is a path (5)\\\\qquad R=Q_0\\\\to Q_1\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to Q_{m-1}\\\\to Q_m=P, where m\\\\ge 1, of directed edges from R to P. The vertices forming the path necessarily coincide with the iterated parents Q_j=\\\\pi^{j}(R) of R, with 0\\\\le j\\\\le m: (6)\\\\qquad R=\\\\pi^{0}(R)\\\\to\\\\pi^{1}(R)\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to\\\\pi^{m-1}(R)\\\\to\\\\pi^{m}(R)=P, where m\\\\ge 1. They can also be viewed as the successive quotients Q_j=R/P_{c-j}(R) of p-class c-j of R when the p-class of R is given by \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(R)=c\\\\ge m: (7)\\\\qquad R\\\\simeq R/P_c(R)\\\\to R/P_{c-1}(R)\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to R/P_{c+1-m}(R)\\\\to R/P_{c-m}(R)\\\\simeq P, where c\\\\ge m\\\\ge 1. In particular, every non-trivial finite p-group G>1 defines a maximal path (consisting of c=\\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G) edges) (8)\\\\qquad G\\\\simeq G/1=G/P_c(G)\\\\to\\\\pi(G)=G/P_{c-1}(G)\\\\to\\\\pi^2(G)=G/P_{c-2}(G)\\\\to\\\\cdots ::\\\\cdots\\\\to\\\\pi^{c-1}(G)=G/P_1(G)\\\\to\\\\pi^c(G)=G/P_0(G)=G/G\\\\simeq 1 ending in the trivial group \\\\pi^c(G)=1. The last but one quotient of the maximal path of G is the elementary abelian p-group \\\\pi^{c-1}(G)=G/P_1(G)\\\\simeq C_p^d of rank d=d(G), where d(G)=\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}(H^1(G,\\\\mathbb{F}_p)) denotes the generator rank of G. Generally, the descendant tree \\\\mathcal{T}(G) of a vertex G is the subtree of all descendants of G, starting at the root G. The maximal possible descendant tree \\\\mathcal{T}(1) of the trivial group 1 contains all finite p-groups and is exceptional, since the trivial group 1 has all the infinitely many elementary abelian p-groups with varying generator rank d\\\\ge 1 as its immediate descendants. However, any non-trivial finite p-group (of order divisible by p) possesses only finitely many immediate descendants. p-covering group, p-multiplicator and nucleus Let G be a finite p-group with d generators. Our goal is to compile a complete list of pairwise non- isomorphic immediate descendants of G. It turns out that all immediate descendants can be obtained as quotients of a certain extension G^{\\\\ast} of G which is called the p-covering group of G and can be constructed in the following manner. We can certainly find a presentation of G in the form of an exact sequence (9)\\\\qquad 1\\\\longrightarrow R\\\\longrightarrow F\\\\longrightarrow G\\\\longrightarrow 1, where F denotes the free group with d generators and \\\\vartheta:\\\\ F\\\\longrightarrow G is an epimorphism with kernel R:=\\\\ker(\\\\vartheta). Then R\\\\triangleleft F is a normal subgroup of F consisting of the defining relations for G\\\\simeq F/R. For elements r\\\\in R and f\\\\in F, the conjugate f^{-1}rf\\\\in R and thus also the commutator \\\\lbrack r,f\\\\rbrack=r^{-1}f^{-1}rf\\\\in R are contained in R. Consequently, R^{\\\\ast}:=\\\\lbrack R,F\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot R^p is a characteristic subgroup of R, and the p-multiplicator R/R^{\\\\ast} of G is an elementary abelian p-group, since (10)\\\\qquad \\\\lbrack R,R\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot R^p\\\\le\\\\lbrack R,F\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot R^p=R^{\\\\ast}. Now we can define the p-covering group of G by (11)\\\\qquad G^{\\\\ast}:=F/R^{\\\\ast}, and the exact sequence (12)\\\\qquad 1\\\\longrightarrow R/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\longrightarrow F/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\longrightarrow F/R\\\\longrightarrow 1 shows that G^{\\\\ast} is an extension of G by the elementary abelian p-multiplicator. We call (13)\\\\qquad \\\\mu(G):=\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}(R/R^{\\\\ast}) the p-multiplicator rank of G. Let us assume now that the assigned finite p-group G\\\\simeq F/R is of p-class \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G)=c. Then the conditions R\\\\triangleleft F and \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(F/R)=c imply P_c(F)\\\\le R, according to the rule (R3), and we can define the nucleus of G by (14)\\\\qquad P_c(G^{\\\\ast})=P_c(F)\\\\cdot R^{\\\\ast}/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\le R/R^{\\\\ast} as a subgroup of the p-multiplicator. Consequently, the nuclear rank (15)\\\\qquad u(G):=\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}(P_c(G^{\\\\ast}))\\\\le\\\\mu(G) of G is bounded from above by the p-multiplicator rank. Allowable subgroups of the p-multiplicator As before, let G be a finite p-group with d generators. Proposition. Any p-elementary abelian central extension (16)\\\\qquad 1\\\\to Z\\\\to H\\\\to G\\\\to 1 of G by a p-elementary abelian subgroup Z\\\\le\\\\zeta_1(H) such that d(H)=d(G)=d is a quotient of the p-covering group G^{\\\\ast} of G. For the proof click show on the right hand side. The reason is that, since d(H)=d(G)=d, there exists an epimorphism \\\\psi:\\\\ F\\\\to H such that \\\\vartheta=\\\\omega\\\\circ\\\\psi, where \\\\omega:\\\\ H\\\\to H/Z\\\\simeq G denotes the canonical projection. Consequently, we have R=\\\\ker(\\\\vartheta)=\\\\ker(\\\\omega\\\\circ\\\\psi)=(\\\\omega\\\\circ\\\\psi)^{-1}(1)=\\\\psi^{-1}(\\\\omega^{-1}(1))=\\\\psi^{-1}(Z) and thus \\\\psi(R)=\\\\psi(\\\\psi^{-1}(Z))=Z. Further, \\\\psi(R^p)=Z^p=1, since Z is p-elementary, and \\\\psi(\\\\lbrack R,F\\\\rbrack)=\\\\lbrack Z,H\\\\rbrack=1, since Z is central. Together this shows that \\\\psi(R^{\\\\ast})=\\\\psi(\\\\lbrack R,F\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot R^p)=1 and thus \\\\psi induces the desired epimorphism \\\\psi^\\\\ast:\\\\ G^{\\\\ast}\\\\to H such that H\\\\simeq G^{\\\\ast}/\\\\ker(\\\\psi^\\\\ast). In particular, an immediate descendant H of G is a p-elementary abelian central extension (17)\\\\qquad 1\\\\to P_{c-1}(H)\\\\to H\\\\to G\\\\to 1 of G, since 1=P_c(H)=\\\\lbrack P_{c-1}(H),H\\\\rbrack\\\\cdot P_{c-1}(H)^p implies P_{c-1}(H)^p=1 and P_{c-1}(H)\\\\le\\\\zeta_1(H), where c=\\\\mathrm{cl}_p(H). Definition. A subgroup M/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\le R/R^{\\\\ast} of the p-multiplicator of G is called allowable if it is given by the kernel M/R^{\\\\ast}=\\\\ker(\\\\psi^\\\\ast) of an epimorphism \\\\psi^\\\\ast:\\\\ G^{\\\\ast}\\\\to H onto an immediate descendant H of G. An equivalent characterization is that 1 is a proper subgroup which supplements the nucleus (18)\\\\qquad (M/R^{\\\\ast})\\\\cdot(P_c(F)\\\\cdot R^{\\\\ast}/R^{\\\\ast})=R/R^{\\\\ast}. Therefore, the first part of our goal to compile a list of all immediate descendants of G is done, when we have constructed all allowable subgroups of R/R^{\\\\ast} which supplement the nucleus P_c(G^{\\\\ast})=P_c(F)\\\\cdot R^{\\\\ast}/R^{\\\\ast}, where c=\\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G). However, in general the list (19)\\\\qquad \\\\lbrace F/M\\\\quad\\\\mid\\\\quad M/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\le R/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\text{ is allowable }\\\\rbrace, where G^{\\\\ast}/(M/R^{\\\\ast})=(F/R^{\\\\ast})/(M/R^{\\\\ast})\\\\simeq F/M, will be redundant, due to isomorphisms F/M_1\\\\simeq F/M_2 among the immediate descendants. Orbits under extended automorphisms Two allowable subgroups M_1/R^{\\\\ast} and M_2/R^{\\\\ast} are called equivalent if the quotients F/M_1\\\\simeq F/M_2, that are the corresponding immediate descendants of G, are isomorphic. Such an isomorphism \\\\varphi:\\\\ F/M_1\\\\to F/M_2 between immediate descendants of G=F/R with c=\\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G) has the property that \\\\varphi(R/M_1)=\\\\varphi(P_c(F/M_1))=P_c(\\\\varphi(F/M_1))=P_c(F/M_2)=R/M_2 and thus induces an automorphism \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Aut}(G) of G which can be extended to an automorphism \\\\alpha^\\\\ast\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Aut}(G^\\\\ast) of the p-covering group G^\\\\ast=F/R^\\\\astof G. The restriction of this extended automorphism \\\\alpha^\\\\ast to the p-multiplicator R/R^\\\\ast of G is determined uniquely by \\\\alpha. Since \\\\alpha^\\\\ast(M/R^{\\\\ast})\\\\cdot P_c(F/R^{\\\\ast})=\\\\alpha^\\\\ast\\\\lbrack M/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\cdot P_c(F/R^{\\\\ast})\\\\rbrack=\\\\alpha^\\\\ast(R/R^\\\\ast)=R/R^\\\\ast, each extended automorphism \\\\alpha^\\\\ast\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Aut}(G^\\\\ast) induces a permutation \\\\alpha^\\\\prime of the allowable subgroups M/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\le R/R^{\\\\ast}. We define P:=\\\\langle\\\\alpha^\\\\prime\\\\mid\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Aut}(G)\\\\rangle to be the permutation group generated by all permutations induced by automorphisms of G. Then the map \\\\mathrm{Aut}(G)\\\\to P, \\\\alpha\\\\mapsto\\\\alpha^\\\\prime is an epimorphism and the equivalence classes of allowable subgroups M/R^{\\\\ast}\\\\le R/R^{\\\\ast} are precisely the orbits of allowable subgroups under the action of the permutation group P. Eventually, our goal to compile a list \\\\lbrace F/M_i\\\\mid 1\\\\le i\\\\le N\\\\rbrace of all immediate descendants of G will be done, when we select a representative M_i/R^{\\\\ast} for each of the N orbits of allowable subgroups of R/R^{\\\\ast} under the action of P. This is precisely what the p-group generation algorithm does in a single step of the recursive procedure for constructing the descendant tree of an assigned root. Capable p-groups and step sizes A finite p-group G is called capable (or extendable) if it possesses at least one immediate descendant, otherwise it is terminal (or a leaf). The nuclear rank u(G) of G admits a decision about the capability of G: :* G is terminal if and only if u(G)=0. :* G is capable if and only if u(G)\\\\ge 1. In the case of capability, G=F/R has immediate descendants of u= u(G) different step sizes 1\\\\le s\\\\le u, in dependence on the index (R/R^\\\\ast:M/R^\\\\ast)=p^s of the corresponding allowable subgroup M/R^\\\\ast in the p-multiplicator R/R^\\\\ast. When G is of order \\\\vert G\\\\vert=p^n, then an immediate descendant of step size s is of order \\\\\\\\#(F/M)=(F/R^\\\\ast:M/R^\\\\ast)=(F/R^\\\\ast:R/R^\\\\ast)\\\\cdot (R/R^\\\\ast:M/R^\\\\ast) =\\\\\\\\#(F/R)\\\\cdot p^s=\\\\vert G\\\\vert\\\\cdot p^s=p^n\\\\cdot p^s=p^{n+s}. For the related phenomenon of multifurcation of a descendant tree at a vertex G with nuclear rank u(G)\\\\ge 2 see the article on descendant trees. The p-group generation algorithm provides the flexibility to restrict the construction of immediate descendants to those of a single fixed step size 1\\\\le s\\\\le u, which is very convenient in the case of huge descendant numbers (see the next section). Numbers of immediate descendants We denote the number of all immediate descendants, resp. immediate descendants of step size s, of G by N, resp. N_s. Then we have N=\\\\sum_{s=1}^ u\\\\,N_s. As concrete examples, we present some interesting finite metabelian p-groups with extensive sets of immediate descendants, using the SmallGroups identifiers and additionally pointing out the numbers 0\\\\le C_s\\\\le N_s of capable immediate descendants in the usual format (N_1/C_1;\\\\ldots;N_ u/C_ u) as given by actual implementations of the p-group generation algorithm in the computer algebra systems GAP and MAGMA. First, let p=3. We begin with groups having abelianization of type (3,3). See Figure 4 in the article on descendant trees. :* The group \\\\langle 27,3\\\\rangle of coclass 1 has ranks u=2, \\\\mu=4 and descendant numbers (4/1;7/5), N=11. :* The group \\\\langle 243,3\\\\rangle=\\\\langle 27,3\\\\rangle-\\\\\\\\#2;1 of coclass 2 has ranks u=2, \\\\mu=4 and descendant numbers (10/6;15/15), N=25. :* One of its immediate descendants, the group \\\\langle 729,40\\\\rangle=\\\\langle 243,3\\\\rangle-\\\\\\\\#1;7, has ranks u=2, \\\\mu=5 and descendant numbers (16/2;27/4), N=43. In contrast, groups with abelianization of type (3,3,3) are partially located beyond the limit of computability. :* The group \\\\langle 81,12\\\\rangle of coclass 2 has ranks u=2, \\\\mu=7 and descendant numbers (10/2;100/50), N=110. :* The group \\\\langle 243,37\\\\rangle of coclass 3 has ranks u=5, \\\\mu=9 and descendant numbers (35/3;2783/186;81711/10202;350652/202266;\\\\ldots), N>4\\\\cdot 10^5 unknown. :* The group \\\\langle 729,122\\\\rangle of coclass 4 has ranks u=8, \\\\mu=11 and descendant numbers (45/3;117919/1377;\\\\ldots), N>10^5 unknown. Next, let p=5. Corresponding groups with abelianization of type (5,5) have bigger descendant numbers than for p=3. :* The group \\\\langle 125,3\\\\rangle of coclass 1 has ranks u=2, \\\\mu=4 and descendant numbers (4/1;12/6), N=16. :* The group \\\\langle 3125,3\\\\rangle=\\\\langle 125,3\\\\rangle-\\\\\\\\#2;1 of coclass 2 has ranks u=3, \\\\mu=5 and descendant numbers (8/3;61/61;47/47), N=116. Schur multiplier Via the isomorphism \\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\to\\\\mu_{\\\\infty}, \\\\frac{n}{d}\\\\mapsto\\\\exp(\\\\frac{n}{d}\\\\cdot 2\\\\pi i) the quotient group \\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\mathbb{Z}=\\\\lbrace\\\\frac{n}{d}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\mid d\\\\ge 1,\\\\ 0\\\\le n\\\\le d-1\\\\rbrace can be viewed as the additive analogue of the multiplicative group \\\\mu_{\\\\infty}=\\\\lbrace z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\mid z^d=1 \\\\text{ for some integer } d\\\\ge 1\\\\rbrace of all roots of unity. Let p be a prime number and G be a finite p-group with presentation G=F/R as in the previous section. Then the second cohomology group M(G):=H^2(G,\\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\mathbb{Z}) of the G-module \\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\mathbb{Z} is called the Schur multiplier of G. It can also be interpreted as the quotient group M(G)=(R\\\\cap\\\\lbrack F,F\\\\rbrack)/\\\\lbrack F,R\\\\rbrack. I. R. Shafarevich Translasted in Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2), 59: 128-149, (1966). has proved that the difference between the relation rank r(G)=\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}(H^2(G,\\\\mathbb{F}_p)) of G and the generator rank d(G)=\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{F}_p}(H^1(G,\\\\mathbb{F}_p)) of G is given by the minimal number of generators of the Schur multiplier of G, that is r(G)-d(G)=d(M(G)). N. Boston and H. Nover have shown that \\\\mu(G_j)- u(G_j)\\\\le r(G), for all quotients G_j:=G/P_j(G) of p-class \\\\mathrm{cl}_p(G_j)=j, j\\\\ge 0, of a pro-p group G with finite abelianization G/G^\\\\prime. Furthermore, J. Blackhurst (in the appendix On the nucleus of certain p-groups of a paper by N. Boston, M. R. Bush and F. Hajir ) has proved that a non-cyclic finite p-group G with trivial Schur multiplier M(G) is a terminal vertex in the descendant tree \\\\mathcal{T}(1) of the trivial group 1, that is, M(G)=1 \\\\Rightarrow u(G)=0. =Examples= :* A finite p-group G has a balanced presentation r(G)=d(G) if and only if r(G)-d(G)=0=d(M(G)), that is, if and only if its Schur multiplier M(G)=1 is trivial. Such a group is called a Schur group and it must be a leaf in the descendant tree \\\\mathcal{T}(1). :*A finite p-group G satisfies r(G)=d(G)+1 if and only if r(G)-d(G)=1=d(M(G)), that is, if and only if it has a non-trivial cyclic Schur multiplier M(G). Such a group is called a Schur+1 group.

In Japanese, refers to the skewers used while katsu means a deep- fried cutlet of meat.  Ingredients  Kushikatsu can be made with chicken, pork, seafood, and seasonal vegetables. These are skewered on bamboo kushi; dipped in egg, flour, and panko; and deep-fried in vegetable oil. They may be served straight or with tonkatsu sauce. ; Meat : beef (gyūniku), pork meat (butaniku) and cartilage (nankotsu), sausage, chicken parts including tsukune (minced chicken), gizzard (sunagimo), skin (torikawa), and horse meat (baniku), chicken egg and Japanese quail egg ; Seafood : Atlantic horse mackerel (aji), Japanese smelt-whitings (kisu), shishamo smelt, wakasagi blackwater smelt, prawn and shrimp (ebi), Japanese scallop (hotate or kaibashira), oyster (kaki), octopus (tako), squid and cuttlefish (ika) ; Vegetable : onion, egg plant (nasu), bamboo shoot (takenoko), okra, tomato, potato, sweet potato, Chinese yam (nagaimo), bell pepper (pīman), lotus root (renkon), greater burdock (gobō), pumpkin (kabocha), broccoli, asparagus, shiitake mushroom, garlic and shishito pepper ; Products and prepared : fish products: chikuwa, hanpen and kamaboko : dairy: hard, cream, and smoked cheeses : prepared: bell pepper stuffed with minced pork, asparagus wrapped with bacon strips, chikuwa filled with hard cheese, mochi rice cakes, dumplings including Jiaozi (gyōza), shūmai, and beni shōga pickled ginger root colored bright pink  Geographical varieties  = Osaka area = Shirotaya restaurant in Osaka The origin of kushiage is said to be served at food bars in downtown Osaka, in the Shinsekai neighborhood. Kushikatsu restaurants specialize in the dish. An owner of a small Shinsekai food bar since 1929 is said to be the pioneer cook, and her menu was quite popular among the district of blue collar workers. She prepared meat on skewers and deep fried, which was a kind of fast food handy to eat, not costly, and filling. As that menu spread to other areas of Osaka and beyond, it is standard that kushikatsu are prepared with a single food not like that in Tokyo where, for example, they alternately put pork and onion on a skewer. Wider varieties of foods were prepared as the menu developed, on the contrary to those in Nagoya or Tokyo, for instance thin slices of pickled ginger or sausage by itself. Generally speaking, the food on a skewer is smaller in Osaka style, and customers tend to order larger numbers of kushi compared to Tokyo or Nagoya. That encouraged many kushiage restaurants to use a premixed \\"batter flour\\" of powdered egg and flour (compared to that in Tokyo or Nagoya where batter is prepared with fresh egg, water and flour topped with panko crusts). High-end kushiage restaurants in Osaka serve kushikatsu in Tokyo-Nagoya style. Grated yam is added for softer texture. New types of kushikatsu restaurants serve fondue-style kushikatsu where customers fry kushi at the table in a deep pan with cooking oil. Kushinobō is a typical high-end Osaka-style kushiage restaurant with franchises across Japan, and it is appreciated for its unique serving style — until a customer informs them that they are full and don't need any more, they continue to bring variations of kushiage to their table. Diced cabbage leaves are a free condiment prepared in a large bowl on the table, which is believed to prevent a feeling dull in the stomach. =Tokyo area = The basic kushikatsu in Kanto eastern Japan area including Tokyo is cooked with pork rib sliced in 3–4 cm (1.5 in) dice, thrust on skewer with sliced onion or leek alternately. Battered with fresh egg, flour and thin layer of panko crust, the skewer is deep fried in vegetable oil — cottonseed, soybean, canola or rapeseed oil. At the table, skewers are seasoned with thick brown sauce, sweeter than Worcestershire sauce, with mustard if they have it in the cruet stand. = Nagoya area = Miso kushikatsu, kushikatsu with miso sauce. Originated in Nagoya region. Yabaton, a Nagoya-style miso katsu restaurant in Ginza In Nagoya and its surrounding cities, they serve the local delicacy doteni, and have an option to order kushikatsu with that. Unlike the serving style in Osaka and Tokyo, in Nagoya, they dip kushikatsu in the thick sauce they grilled and sauteed beef sinew. That sauce is based on hatcho-miso, and the kushikatsu is called miso katsu.  Other varieties  Sophisticated sauces are prepared in suburban areas of other cities including Nishinomiya and Kobe, and several sauces are served along with kushikatsu course. Plain salt, soy sauce, sesame oil and ketchup along with tartar sauce, miso, mayonnaise and other dip style sauce could be the speciality of each restaurant. Eating manner  Eating style is unique at kushikatu restaurants and food bars as kushikatsu is dipped into a pot of thinner sauce before eating. As a sauce pot is shared among customers, reinserting food after a bite is seen as bad manners and unsanitary. Instead, a slice of cabbage is used to scoop up sauce from the pot and pour it onto the kushikatsu. In some restaurants they put a brush or spoon at the shared pot to season the kushi. Some kushiyaki restaurants have a menu and instructions in English and other languages to warn travelers not to dip food into the shared sauce pot after biting it.  Children's songs  A comic kushikatsu song titled \\"Kushikatsu wa ippon\\" became popular to the generation born in 1990s as they enjoyed the song in children's song program on TV broadcast. * \\"Kushikatsuwa ippon\\" (Single Kushikatsu Skewer), broadcast on NHK channel * \\"Daruma no Ossan no Uta - sōsu no nidozuke wa kinshi ya de\\" (Song dedicated to Mr. Darma - never dip your kushikatsu twice in the sauce pot) See also * List of deep fried foods * Notes References Further reading Category:Japanese cuisine Category:Japanese cuisine terms ","title":"Kushikatsu"},{"id":"43440006","text":"Juan Louw Schoeman (born in Pretoria, South Africa) is a South African rugby union player for the Bath in Premiership Rugby.

The game was a modification of Exidy's 1975 game Destruction Derby in which players crashed into cars to accrue points. In Death Race, the objective became to run into \\"gremlins\\" to gain score. The game could be played with one or two players controlling different cars. The original working title for the game which appeared on some early advertisements was Death Race 98. The game attracted a great deal of controversy over the content of the game which was centered around killing humanoid figures. In July 1976, newspapers and civic organizations began to attack the game for facilitating violence in virtual form.  History  In 1975, Exidy licensed its game Destruction Derby to arcade game company Chicago Coin to manufacture. However, the following year Chicago Coin entered financial difficulties which would eventually lead to the dissolution of the company, and as Exidy had sold exclusive manufacturing rights they could no longer profit from Destruction Derby. Needing an interim product to introduce to distributors, they decided to modify the Destruction Derby game so that it would be saleable by their organization. Newly-arrived engineer Howell Ivy from Ramtek made several modifications to Destruction Derby in order to create this new product. He added curbs to the left and right of the screen that the enemies could hide behind, but players would be stalled if they attempted to cross over. On the top and bottom of the screen, players could wrap around to the opposite side in a manner similar to Atari's Space Race (1973). The enemy opponents were changed to animated figures which walked around the screen instead of vehicles. These 'gremlins' would wander the playspace until one of the players collided with them, at which point they would let out a 'screech' and leave behind a cross representing a tombstone. Though a number of sources have reported that the game was a licensed adaptation of the 1975 film Death Race 2000, Exidy has denied that this was the case. The name \\"Death Race\\" was chosen as a reflection of the undead monsters depicted in the cabinet art and marketing, both devised by artist Michael Cooper-Hart. = Controversy = Exidy only intended Death Race as an interim product until their subsequent game Car Polo (1977) was completed. However, in July 1976 Associated Press reporter Wendy Walker reached out to Exidy based on her viewing of the game at a Seattle arcade. Concerned about the game's violent content and its potential effect on those playing it, she wrote a widely disseminated article which pointed out the game's content unfavorably. Following this article, many news organizations through 1976 and 1977 reported on Death Race, including national newspapers like The New York Times. Many at Exidy attribute a large jump in sales for the company to this increase in national profile for Death Race, even though most of the coverage was negative. By the end of 1977 the game no longer graced headlines. Gameplay An upright cabinet In the game, one or two players control an on- screen car with a steering wheel and an acceleration pedal. The object is to run down \\"gremlins\\" who are fleeing the vehicle. As the player hits them, they scream or squeal and are replaced on-screen by tombstones. This increases the challenge of the game as the screen clutters up and the player has to avoid the tombstones. The cabinet is black-with-white graphics of a muscle car racing through a cemetery with a vulture in a tree looking on. The marquee and monitor bezel are colored. A limited number had white sides with the artwork in black, instead of the reverse. It was in an upright standard racing-style cabinet. Legacy Funspot has a working arcade machine in an all-yellow cabinet. An original arcade version of Death Race is present in the Musée Mécanique in San Francisco. The Galloping Ghost Arcade in Brookfield, Illinois, received an original black cabinet as a donation. In 2016 Binary Star Software released a dual title cartridge called \\"Nox / Death Chase\\". The release of \\"Death Chase\\" recreates the look, feel, and play of the 1970s Death Race on the 1980s Vectrex vector graphics home video game system.

He has several important public works, most notably a statue of Sarah Siddons in Westminster Abbey. He also has several works in the National Gallery in London. He was heavily patronised by the British aristocracy, as evidenced by his works. Life He was born in Tolbooth parish, Edinburgh Old Town, now part of the Royal Mile. He was the son of Douglas Campbell, \\"gentleman servant\\", and Helen Thorburn. He was apprenticed to John Marshall, marble cutter on Leith Walk. Around 1817 he attracted the patronage of Gilbert Innes of Stow, depute governor of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He paid for Campbell to study at the Royal Academy Schools in London from 1818, and also permitted him to set up a studio in Rome, Italy in 1819, where a connection continued until 1830. In Rome he met with both Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen.Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660–1851, Gunnis (online database) In London he studied under Joseph Nollekens and assisted Edward Hodges Baily.

The former Batley General Hospital Record requests began in the late 1950s when the station set up a studio in the attic of Batley General Hospital. From there it broadcast to the former Dewsbury General Hospital, Staincliffe Hospital and five care homes across the Heavy Woollen District. In the 1980s, the National Health Service announced plans to build a new hospital to replace Batley General Hospital, Dewsbury General Hospital and Staincliffe Hospital. HWD Hospital Radio moved to a brand-new studio complex at the newly built Dewsbury and District Hospital in 1989, where it remains to this day. The studios were officially opened on 23 November 1989 by Harry Gration of BBC Look North. HWD Hospital Radio has extended and refurbished its studio complex over the years to include the latest digital technology. The station broadcasts 24 hours a day online through its website. Studio One at HWD Hospital RadioA wide variety of programmes are broadcast covering a range of genres as well as sports commentary, entertainment and news.

Sri Lankan government forces currently have Ms Jeyakumari and her 13-year-old daughter Vipoosika in detention at an unknown location. They gained prominence during British Prime Minister David Cameron’s visit to Jaffna in November, when Vipoosika’s desperate pleas for the return of her missing brother gained widespread coverage. Civil society campaigners have expressed concern for the safety of mother and daughter. Protests against the Government of Sri Lanka =Forced disappearance of son= Jeyakumari's youngest son was conscripted into the LTTE prior to the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War that was being waged in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country. Having survived the war and rejoined his family, the boy was asked to surrender to the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. Jeyakumari heeded the call of the authorities and surrendered her son, who was 15 years old at the time. He vanished while in the custody of the Lankan state, after he was photographed being ‘rehabilitated’. Since then Jeyakumari has been engaged in a peaceful struggle to discover the whereabouts not only of her son, but also of thousands of others who 'disappeared' while in the Sri Lankan military's custody. She emerged as one of the leading human rights activists in the Northern Province among thousands of widows and children who lost their husbands, fathers and loved ones during the conflict. She and Vipoosika have been prominent in campaigns to establish the whereabouts of missing people. =Demonstrations in 2013= Jeyakumari led the demonstration that greeted British Prime Minister David Cameron when he visited Jaffna in November 2013. She and Vipoosika were at the forefront of a weeping crowd that held up photographs of their missing relatives. Arrest Demonstrators holding placards supporting Jeyakumari's release Jeyakumari and Vipoosika were arrested in March 2014 on alleged charges that they were harboring a suspected criminal who had shot and wounded a policeman. Hundreds of troops surrounded the area while the arrest took place. The Sri Lankan Police later announced that both had been detained by officers attached to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID). When one of her friends tried to contact her by phone, the military personnel terminated the call and the phone was switched off. TNPF leader, Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, who was able to speak briefly to Ms Jeyakumari soon after the raid began, said she was being threatened for taking part in protests by families of those who had disappeared. Jeyakumari is still being detained without any charge. She fears for her life because she possesses tangible evidence against the Sri Lankan Armed Forces for rights violations, especially in relation to the disappearance of her husband, the killing of her two sons and the disappearance of the third. She has a strong case against the government because it published a photograph of her son in a government book depicting rehabilitation of rebel fighters. Furthermore, the Sri Lankan state has also detained Ruki Fernando and Father Praveen Mahesan, human right defenders in the north, who were documenting her arrest and trying to assist her. International organisations such as the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAID) and Asian Human Rights Commission(AHRC) have expressed shock and concern over Jeyakumari's arbitrary detention and believe that her life is in danger. Prior to the arrests of Fernando and Jeyakumari, several other human rights defenders and critics of the authoritarian Rajapaksa-led government were intimidated, harassed, and have disappeared.

It is generally applied to the misery of realising that one has contributed to one's own injury but also as a warning against self-reliant pride. The fable and its interpretations The earliest mention of the fable is a brief reference in The Myrmidons, a lost tragedy of Aeschylus written in the 5th century BCE. Here it is said to be of Libyan origin and is generally supposed to refer to the personal blame felt by Achilles for the death of his friend Patroclus.G.J. van Dyck, Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi, Brill 1997, pp.169 ff ::So the eagle, pierced by the bow-sped shaft, looked :: At the feathered device and said, “Thus, not by others, ::But by means of our own plumage are we slain”.Apuleius and Africa, Routledge 2014, p.194, note 17 Widespread references to the fable afterwards suggest that it had gained proverbial force.Francisco Rodríguez Adrados, History of the Graeco-latin Fable vol.3, Brill 2003, p.587 A version titled \\"The Archer and the Eagle\\" and ascribed to Aesop appeared among the collection of fables by Babrius.Fables of Æsop and Babrius, verse translation by J.B. Rose, Dover 1870, p.87 The fable did not appear in mediaeval collections of fables reliant on Latin sources but began to be noticed in Europe from the 16th century. In Guillaume La Perrière's Emblem book Le théatre des bons engins (The theatre of fine devices, 1544), there is an illustration of the wounded eagle accompanied by a verse commenting that its sorrow at being struck down is doubled by the knowledge that it has furnished the means for its own destruction.Emblem 52 But when the situation appeared in La Fontaine's Fables, it was under the more generalised title of \\"The bird wounded by an arrow\\" (II.6) and a wider lesson is drawn from the incident. The dying bird blames humans for using its own parts against itself and claims that they have learnt this cruelty from the way they treat each other.Norman Shapiro, 50 Fables of La Fontaine, University of Illinois 1997, p.23 A savage landscape by Anne-Louis Girodet A contemporary French emblem book took a different view of how the bird had contributed to its own hurt. Daniel de la Feuille's Devises et emblêmes (1691) starts from the perception that the bird in the poem was on the look-out for a hare. If another hunter brings it down while so engaged, then it is a case of poetic justice, of having inflicted on itself the harm it was purposing to inflict on others. Illustrated under the Latin title Capiens capior (the preyer become prey), it shows a sparrow hawk perched on a hare with an arrow through its own neck.Emblem Project Utrecht There is also a coded reference to the fable in a mountain landscape by Anne-Louis Girodet dating from 1793/5. There an eagle pierced by an arrow lies at the foot of the picture, while towards it a huge snake is crawling across the rocks. Its writhing is echoed by the strangling ivy that climbs the tree beneath which the bird has fallen. Violence and cruelty is not limited to the human sphere; in the artist's eyes they are characteristic of nature as a whole.See the commentary on the drawing in the Gazette Drouot The Greek origin of the fable was not lost sight of in France and Isaac de Benserade included L'aigle percé d'une flèche in his collection of Aesop's fables, recounting how it had allowed certain feathers to drop while grooming itself which were collected by the hunter who shot it.Fables d'Ésope mises en François, 1678, fable 179 Pierre de Frasnay (1676–1753) also provided a four-line poetic version in his Mythologie ou recueil des fables grecques, ésopiques et sybaritiques (Orléans 1750). The moral he drew from the story was that one should not be too self-reliant, for that too is an avenue that leads to harm. Condemnation of pride was the interpretation given the fable when it travelled eastwards as well. In the 11th century Diwan (poetical works) of Nasir Khusraw, an eagle soars through the air, vaunting itself. When it is brought down by a hunter and recognises the feathers on the arrow, the realisation comes that it has been injured by its own means.A translation by Henri Massé is included in Anthologie persane (XIe-XIXe siècles) Pieter de la Court was to give the story a similar interpretation in his Sinryke Fabulen (1685), making the point that those who thrust themselves into prominence become the mark for others to harm. The point is underlined by the Latin tag beneath the illustration of the injured bird, an adaptation of proverbial lines from the 4th century Latin poet Claudian: Vivitur exiguo melius, natura beatis / omnibus esse dedit, si quis cognoverit uti (it is better to live on little, [nature has provided for all to do so happily,] could one but know it).In Rufinum 1, 215–6, cited in 5000 proverbi e motti latini, Milan 1990 Yet another fable of similar meaning is numbered 303 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site In it an oak (or a pine in another version) complains of being split by wedges made from its own branches. Commentaries on these fables point out that suffering is increased by the knowledge that it is one's own fault.History of the Graeco-Latin Fable : Volume I. Introduction and from the Origins to the Hellenistic Age. Poetical allusions The proverbial image of the wounded eagle was to become a common conceit in English poetry of the 17th century and after. Just as Aeschylus described his image as coming from Libya, James Howell identifies the 2nd century writer Lucian as his source in a commendatory poem on the work of Giles Fletcher: ::England, like Lucian’s eagle with an arrow ::Of her own plumes, piercing her heart quite thorow.The Works of Beaumont and Fletcher, London 1840, p.lxiii As he does so, he is also echoing the same conceit used in Fletcher's poem \\"Christ's Victory in Heaven\\".The Works of the British Poets, vol.4, Edinburgh 1795, p.498, stanza XIX Two poets identified with the Cavalier cause also used the conceit. Katherine Philips placed it at the start of her poem \\"On Controversies in Religion\\" (1667), arguing that religion becomes the victim of misapplied texts ::And meets that Eagles destiny, whose breast ::Felt the same shaft which his own feathers drest.Rutgers University, lines 5–6 Edmund Waller, on the other hand, turned the image to Baroque hyperbole by making himself the victim of \\"A Lady singing a Song of his Composing\\".The works of the English poets, from Chaucer to Cowper, London 1810, vol.8, p.50 The image was still current at the start of the 19th century. Lord Byron used it in the course of lamenting the early death of Henry Kirke White while still a student.\\"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers\\", lines 826ff At more or less the same time, Thomas Moore applied it in his early political poem \\"Corruption\\" (1808).The Works of Thomas Moore, Paris 1823, Vol.6, pp.26–7 Artistic use Rosa Bonheur's The Wounded Eagle c.1870, LACMA La Fontaine's version of the fable was illustrated by woodcuts in various editions over the centuries, usually by nothing more original than a picture of a bird lying on the ground with an arrow piercing its neck or breast. One or other of these served as model for the left-hand page of Kawanabe Kyosui's coloured woodcut in the collectors edition Choix de Fables de La Fontaine published from Tokyo in 1894 with illustrations by Japanese artists. What brings the composition to life is the depiction of the bowman crouching on the bushy shore on the right-hand page. Marc Chagall also included a distant bowman in his coloured print of 1927 but gives greater prominence to the death agonies of the wounded bird, which is echoed by the waving foliage in the background. André Masson's L'oiseau percé de flèches (1925) equally gives a sense of painful movement. In this Cubist work, the stricken bird inclines diagonally across a stylised rocky background and still aspires upwards. The painting by Rosa Bonheur of a wounded eagle in mid-air (c. 1870) is not generally referred to the original Greek fable and no arrow is shown there. Instead, it is the eagle's political symbolism on which critics comment, interpreting the work as referring both to the defeat of Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian war and to the injury to the Prussian state of its aggression.Eric Zafran, Fantasy and Faith, Yale University 2007, p.193, note 61 Nevertheless, the theme of harm brought by its own agency is available as an alternative reading. Among musical settings of La Fontaine's fable are Heitor Villa-Lobos' for voice and piano (1913), and that of Marcelle de Manziarly as the second of her Trois Fables de La Fontaine (1935).The Lied, Art Song and Choral Text Archive In addition, it was Marianne Moore’s poetical versions that were used in Ned Rorem's Fables (1971) as the basis of his 'very short operas', of which \\"The bird wounded by an arrow\\" is placed third.

At St. Celestine, the Lucky 13 gang tells Samantha that Top is waiting outside before playing a live song performance. She goes outside and sees Top at his car apologizing that she can't do anything about the marriage but she still loves him promising that she will be back for him and Top replied to her that he is willing to wait for the day she returns and they kiss under the fireworks. Two years later, Samantha receives a call from Audrey that Top got into an accident after he mysteriously vanished without anyone knowing. Samantha and Red return home and Samantha realizes that Top could be at his beach house. She goes to the beach house and she watches a video footage of a boy and a girl making promises to each other that they will be getting married someday as seen in the beginning of the film. Meanwhile, Red admits to Audrey that he has fallen in love with Samantha. As Samantha remembers the lost memories of her past that she and Top made promise to each other when they were just kids, a dog walks through and lead her to Top at the beach. Samantha saw him as she realizes that he lost his sight as Top asks God for a miracle because he badly needs one as Samantha/Miracle hugs Top/Timothy with so much tears of joy of their reunion. After the first part of the credits, a scene was featured where Samantha and Red kisses each other as they saw Top watching them unhappy of what he just saw, and a sequel (Never Talk Back To A Gangster) is then confirmed that will be released soon.

Translation: Come What May), a duet featuring the two stars of the movie, Nadine Lustre and James Reid. Reception =Critical response= Philbert Ortiz-Dy of Click the City gave a mixed review in the film, he stated that \\"The film just feels hastily assembled, its only real purpose to provide another platform for the onscreen pairing of Nadine Lustre and James Reid [...] but the pair works best outside the machinations of the plot, when the movie simply gives them the room to linger in an intimate moment.\\" He also stated that \\"Talk Back and You're Dead makes so little sense that it may as well be taking place in an entirely different universe. What starts out as a weird little tale of animosity growing into affection turns into a monster of melodramatic convolutions reliant on information that's mostly hidden from the audience.\\" Zig Marasigan of Rappler gave a harsh review of the film, stating \\"Trying to make sense of Talk Back and You're Dead is very much like watching a snake eat its own tail. It's fascinatingly grotesque, watching a serpent devour itself from the outside. It slowly works towards its delicate innards, oblivious to its own demise. The snake eventually dies from its own gastric juices, and all you're left with is a reptilian corpse that is just too eager but too consumed to tell its tail from its meal. Talk Back and You're Dead doesn't have a horrible story, it simply doesn't have a story. But if a film like Talk Back and You're Dead can be produced and released without a need for story, who needs writers?.\\" =Box office= According to the showbiz news reporter Ginger Conejero of TV Patrol, the film earns PHP 30 Million on its first 3 days of showing. Box Office Mojo places the total gross of PHP 76,941,733 as of September 14, 2014, second to the top-grosser Rurouni Kenshin. There has been no official release of the final box office gross from the film's production. Potential sequel During the end credits, a clip from the sequel was shown and it is confirmed that there will be a sequel of this film, entitled Never Talk Back To A Gangster. As of 2018, there is still no confirmation by the director or the production staff about the said sequel coming out.

Goblinshead. p.52 The structure is unsound and is protected as a scheduled monument. History The estate originally belonged to the Crawford family, and they built the castle in about 1470. In about 1540 it passed by marriage to the Livingstones, who built an extension at the south west. They also built an extension along the south east wall in 1586. When James Livingstone was created Baron Livingstone of Almond in 1633 the castle’s name was changed to Almond from Haining. After the Jacobite rising of 1715 the castle was forfeited to the crown by the Livingstone Earls of Callendar. It was abandoned in the 1750s. In 1783 the ruin was sold to William Forbes by the York Buildings Company. Structure The ruin has a vaulted basement. The hall was on the first floor, while there is a kitchen in the wing. There is a courtyard, with a wall and ditch, enclosing the remains of 16th-century buildings. The castle was four storeys and a garret high.

They can be reserved for meetings or celebrations. The Promenade des Berges de la Seine is a public park and promenade located along the left bank of the Seine river in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay. The promenade, created on the former highway that ran along the left bank, includes five floating gardens, planted atop barges, plus exhibition areas, performance and classroom spaces, playgrounds, sports facilities and cafes. Begun in 2008, it was opened by Mayor Bertrand Delanoë on June 19, 2013. Everything in the park can be dismantled and moved within 24 hours if the water of the river rises too high.Le Moniteur, June 19, 2013 History The first quay along the Seine, the Quai des Grand-Augustins, was built at the beginning of the 16th century. By the early 19th century the riverbanks were fully paved and developed; the site of the modern park was occupied by a depot for building stones, docks, and some waterfront cafes. In the early 20th century it was the home of a floating swimming pool. Between 1961 and 1967, a highway was built along the river to reduce traffic in the center of the city. In 1991 the banks of the Seine were declared a UNESCO cultural site, and efforts began to turn the waterfront into a park. Beginning in 2001, the highway was closed to traffic on Sundays and used by runners and promenaders. In 2008, under Mayor Bertrand Delanoe, a project was approved to turn the section of the highway from the Musee D'Orsay to the Pont de l'Alma into a permanent public promenade. The promenade was designed by architect Franklin Azzi, while one of the most prominent new features, a series of five floating gardens, was created by Jean Christophe Chobet. The project cost a total of 35 million euros, and was dedicated by Mayor Delanoe on June 19, 2013. Description The promenade is 2.3 kilometers long, and occupies an area of 4.5 hectares. It is accessible by the former onramps and offramps that once served the highway. The most unusual feature of the park is the floating garden, composed of five \\"islands\\", or barges permanently moored to the riverbank at the port du Gros Caillou, near the Pont de l'Alma. The \\"islands\\" have been planted with about sixty trees, 280 bushes, and three thousand other plants, and provide benches and chairs for relaxing beside the river. They are securely anchored to the bottom of the river, and designed to resist a flood higher than the great Paris flood of 1910. Another unusual feature of the promenade is a group of tipis which can be hired, and a collection of cargo containers with large glass windows which have been turned into meeting rooms which can be rented for use for parties, banquets or meetings. The promenade has several playgrounds, as well as a climbing wall and a course for gymnastics and exercises. It also has meeting spaces for classes in dance and sports, performance spaces and open-air classrooms, and an area for outdoor photo exhibits. There are several outdoor cafes near the bridges along the promenade. Given that the park is situated just above the level of the river, and well below the street level of Paris, all the equipment and structures in the park are designed to be portable. With twenty-four hours' notice, everything moveable in the park can be taken to higher ground in the event that the site is flooded.

It is located at 10 Bunker Hill Avenue. History Stratham had private libraries since 1793, and began to financially support the last of these in 1896. In 1912 a dedicated library building was built at 158 Portsmouth Avenue. The single-story stone structure was designed by Charles Howard Walker. Its construction was funded by a bequest from Emma Blodgett Wiggin, and was named as a memorial to her and her husband, George Wiggin. It served as the town's public library until 1989, when it moved to its current facilities. The old building now serves as a research library and meeting place for the Stratham Historical Society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. In March, 2018, the Wiggin Memorial Library was named one of 14 library finalists for the National Medal for Museum and Library Service, the highest honor given to museums and libraries for service in the community, awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services in Washington D.C.

Probably built in the 1770s, it is a remarkably little-altered example of vernacular Federal period architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Cornet Thomas Wiggin House is located north of the town center of Stratham, on the north side of Portsmouth Avenue at its junction with Depot Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, two interior brick chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical arrangement of windows around a center entrance. The entrance includes an original wide six- panel door, flanked by tapered flat pilasters, which rise to a transom window and corniced entablature. This surround is believed to date to about 1830, when other alterations were made to the building. A two-story ell extends to the left, and a single-story ell extends to the rear, projecting slightly to the right side. The house was built c. 1775, although it was apparently not completed until the 1790s, after the death of Thomas Wiggin and the resolution of legal disputes concerning his estate. The interior is thought to have been finished by Nathan Barker, Wiggin's son-in-law and eventual purchaser of the property. The house is a well-preserved example of vernacular Federal architecture, and the property includes a barn that is believed to date to the same period.

He was born in Norwich and lived for almost fifty years in Ipswich. For although Reynolds is most widely known as a sculptor, he possessed the capacity to be an inspirational teacher as well as an artist, and he fulfilled both of these roles with his own particular kind of integrity. Reynolds was characterised for his quietly rigorous self-imposed discipline to every project he undertook – and due to his multiple pursuits, his projects were many and varied. Early life Bernard Reynolds was born on 2 June 1915 in Norwich and lived for almost fifty years in Ipswich. In 1932, at the age of 17, he studied at Norwich School of Art (currently Norwich University of the Arts), where he was inspired by the art master, W.T. Watling. In the final year of his studies, he expressed his inclination towards sculpture. Led by Susan Lascelles for wood engraving, Reynolds became an admirer of Blair Hughes-Stanton. In 1937, he moved to London to continue his studies at the Westminster School of Art. One year later, Reynolds got a post as a naval instruments engineer in Norwich and this endured throughout the war times and thereafter. This wartime experience as an engineer seems to have strengthened rather than repressed his artistic practice. In fact, craftsmanship has influenced his observations vis-a-vis nature and mankind. He constantly expanded the knowledge of materials and techniques in his sculpture studio. As he noted, \\"I was one who was always interested in things, in specimens, and so that brought me round strongly on the side of sculpture ... the forms of solid nature rather than views of nature.\\" Apropos of his Bird Skull Series, he explained \\"...it's symbolic of primaeval life which runs through nearly all my themes ... an upthrust of growth and energy.\\" Post-War years Reynolds co-founded Norwich Twenty Group in 1944. After the formation of Colchester Art Society in 1946, Cedric Morris proposed Reynolds to join the society where he became a committee member for a period of time. In 1947, he was offered a temporary post as Lecturer in Sculpture at Sheffield College of Art, which transformed to the Psalter Lane campus of Sheffield Hallam University in Sheffield, England and officially closed on 31 August 2008. This was the beginning of his thirty-four years of art school teaching. The following year, he gained the post at Ipswich School of Art, for which his application was very exceptional in showing evidence of his talented techniques. Thanks to him the sculpture course in East Anglia stood out amongst other schools of art by the late fifties. Being always active in the art world, thereon, John and Pam Dan invited Reynolds to share his expertise on a visual arts panel of the Wivenhoe Arts Club just after its opening in 1966. He was an astute critic of art, whose carefully judged opinions were valued by colleagues, friends and students alike. In conjunction with these artists and later Edward Barker of Norwich, Reynolds's multiple pursuits led him to run exhibitions of East Anglian Sculpture since 1949 to 1966. The very first one happened indoors in Ipswich School of Art, while the ones that followed gave breath to parks and castle gardens of East Anglian areas. This highlighted his interest about the natural environment along with arts, which reveal a precise and searching sensibility. Among the outdoor spaces were the Norwich Castle Gardens, Christchurch Park, Ipswich, Mary Potter's Garden, Aldeburgh, Anthony Stokes' Hintlesham Park, Colchester, and the Colchester Castle Gardens. Additionally, once the Corn Exchange, Ipswich, was transformed into an Arts and Entertainment Centre, Reynolds organised the 'Sculpture in Anglia' Exhibitions of 1975, 1978 and 1981. He also participated in shows at King's Lynn, Halesworth and of course London. Unquestionably, his vivid work stood out in all of the above. In 1971, he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and two years after that he was presented with the Sir Otto Beit Medal by Sir Charles Wheeler. Other achievements As a man who \\"lived by and for his art\\", Bernard Reynold's deep dedication to his calling was never in question. Apart from his involvement in exhibitions and teaching, Reynolds was commissioned to create sculptures for several buildings in Ipswich. He made cement reliefs on the Castle Hill and Sprites Lane schools, a stone relief on the Eastern Counties Farmers Head Office, the pair of 22 ft. 'Pylons' which flank the entrance to Suffolk College, a 24 ft. stained-glass window in St. Matthew's School and the 14 ft. Ship Fountain Sculpture at the Civic Centre. Because of it, he was awarded the Sir Otto Beit Medal for 1972. It was 'the best piece of sculpture to come to the notice of the R.B.S. as being set up anywhere in the British Commonwealth, excluding London, during that year'. In addition, he made the 8 ft. aluminium sculpture on a theme of plant growth for Messrs Fison's factory at Stanford-le-Hope in Essex. Family Reynold's wife was a painter. They have a son and two daughters. Tributes In April 1991, on the occasion of the private view of an exhibition of Reynolds's sculpture at the Chappel Galleries near Colchester, the painter Colin Moss commented that Reynolds was 'as near, in these days of specialisation, to the archetypal renaissance man as one may find.' ‘He is the kind of man', wrote Hamilton Wood of Bernard, 'who does every job well.' ‘As a man who \\"lived by and for his art\\", Reynolds's deep dedication to his calling was never in question. Reynold's contribution to Art in East Anglia, as an artist, colleague and teacher, when combined with his sculpture and drawings, leaves a considerable legacy' . – Pat Hurrell References Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Norwich Category:1915 births Category:20th-century British sculptors Category:British male sculptors Category:Artists from Ipswich Category:Alumni of Norwich University of the Arts ","title":"Bernard Reynolds"},{"id":"43440543","text":"Jorge Barreto Xavier (born, 6 November 1965, Goa, India) is a Portuguese cultural manager, university professor and politician. He was, between October 2012 and October 2015, the Secretary of State for Culture of the XIX Constitutional Government of Portugal, under the authority of the Prime- Minister, Pedro Passos Coelho.  Biography  He was born in Goa. In 1970 he moved to Portugal, to the city of Guarda, Beira Interior. He lived in Guarda and Sabugal before he went to Lisbon in 1984 to study Law. In 1986, when he was 20 years old, he founded the Portuguese Club of Arts and Ideas (PCAI). In 1987, he created and coordinated the 1st Portuguese Arts and Ideas Show, an initiative that aimed to present the contemporary art and that has integrated works in the fields of architecture, fine arts, comics, cinema, dance, graphic design, photography, literature, music, theatre and video, a pioneer joint in Portugal. This presentation model would be used in further initiatives that he has directed, like \\"New values of Culture\\" (1988), \\"Culture and Development\\" (1989 and 1990), \\"Tendencies\\" (1991) and \\"Young Artists\\" (1992), a name that continues to be used in initiatives annually developed by the PCAI to promote artists in the beginning of their careers. In 1991, with colleagues from the first graduate program on Arts Management in Portugal (1989), he founded the Portuguese Association of Arts´ Managers. In 1992, creates the Paideia program- artistic animation on secondary schools, an initiative through which contemporary art (music, theatre, dance, photography, fine arts, video) was taken to 180 Portuguese secondary schools until 1997. Alongside that, since 1988, through the PCAI, he became representative of Portugal on the Biennial of Young Artists from Europe and the Mediterranean, important for the internationalization of the Portuguese artists in the 80's and 90's of the twentieth century. In 1994 he directed the 7th Edition of the Biennial of Lisbon, with more than 500 artists from 20 countries. In 1997, he created the \\"Common Place- Experimentation Arts Centre\\" at a gunpowder factory in Barcarena, Oeiras. It was the first integrated centre of artistic experimentation in Portugal and one of the largest in Europe (with the possibility to work in several fields: visual arts, dance, music, theatre, writing, video and intermedia projects). Also in this year, created the \\"Biennial of Young Creators of Lusophone Countries\\", which continues to take place. Still on that period, as a member of the National Education Council, with Emília Nadal, he wrote the report \\"Arts Education, Aesthetic Education and the internationalization of Knowledge\\", published in 1998. In January 2003 he became Deputy Mayor of the Municipality of Oeiras, in charge of Culture, Youth and Consumer's Protection. In Oeiras he created the Youth Network by extending the available public spaces to the young people throughout the municipality. On the Cultural area, he put into action the requalification project of Palácio Anjos, in Algés, to host the art collection Manuel Brito, one of the most important in the country. It was also in this period that Jorge Barreto Xavier led the Inter-ministerial Commission on Education/Culture. In January 2006, he began his collaboration with Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, where, until April 2008, he led the project \\"Reintegration through Arts\\" on the Educational Centres of the Directorate- General of Social Reintegration from the Ministry of Justice. In April 2008, he becomes General-Director for the Arts. On that position, Jorge Barreto Xavier leads the reform of the State supports for the artistic activities and draws and implement the program \\"Inov-Art\\" that would become, in 2009 and 2010, the biggest program of professional international internships in the Cultural field promoted by a public authority from the European Union, with more than 200 interns per year, allocated in dozens of cities from 28 countries of the five continents. In July 2010 he resigns from the position of General-Director for the Arts. In September 2011 he started teaching at ISCTE – Lisbon University Institute, by designing and teaching the modules of cultural policies and creative industries´ management.

It was built by Mexico City architect Jose Luis Moreno a specialist in designing restaurants and small hotels, and opened in 1995. Moreno had first visited the area in 1976, when Cancún had few hotels and an airport terminal with a thatched roof. He first built a home for himself and then another which he planned to sell. In 1988 a hurricane destroyed the second house and he decided to rebuild it as a hotel. The hotel is built from local materials, including palm, bamboo and stone quarried in Mérida (the Yucatán’s old Hispanic capital). Two- or three-storey buildings are dotted on the 25-acre beachfront portion of the 500-acre property, linked by stone walkways through the jungle. The resort was constructed without formal blueprints as Moreno always drew his free-flowing designs in the sand. Once he had his concept, a family of local masons, with whom he had worked on other projects, came to implement his designs. In 2002 the resort was acquired by Orient-Express Hotels, which in 2014 changed its name to Belmond Ltd. At that time the hotel was renamed Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa The company still uses the same family of Maya masons that have been working at the resort for over four decades and have added new oceanfront spa villas, expanded the restaurant and bar, added two new pools and built Kinan Spa.

It is known to form fairy rings. Naming Sowerby's illustration which is part of the original definition of P. flaccida The naming history of this mushroom is complicated by the fact that for a long time it was regarded as two different species, \\"flaccida\\" (associated with broad-leaved trees) and \\"inversa\\" (associated with conifers and with a smoother shinier cap). These forms can still be differentiated as varieties within P. flaccida if desired. The earliest description was by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772 as Agaricus inversus in his book Flora Carniolica, then in 1799 James Sowerby created a description under the name Agaricus flaccidus in his major work \\"Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms\\". In later years there were defined the combinations Clitocybe flaccida (by Paul Kummer, 1871), Clitocybe inversa (by Lucien Quélet, 1872), and Lepista flaccida and Lepista inversa (by Narcisse Patouillard, 1887). There followed long-standing confusion over whether Clitocybe or Lepista was the appropriate genus. Using molecular analysis, in 2012 Alfredo Vizzini published a paper showing (with a detailed phylogram) that these mushrooms together with Lepista gilva form a clade which is separate from other Lepista species (such as Lepista nuda) and also from Clitocybe species (such as Clitocybe fragrans). Jörg H. Raithelhuber had already proposed the name Paralepista as a genus for those mushrooms in 1981, this had become accepted as a subgenus only, and Vizzini accordingly adopted the same name at the genus level. The new genus is recognized by Species Fungorum, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, but not necessarily in derivative databases such as the Encyclopedia of Life. Older mushroom references generally listed the flaccida and inversa forms as separate species, but modern authorities merge them into one. In English P. flaccida is sometimes called the tawny funnel cap. Description Var. flaccida The following sections use the given references throughout. =General= *The cap grows up to 10 cm in diameter It is depressed in the centre or funnel-shaped when old and has a variable brownish colour which may be ochraceous, orange or reddish. *In the flaccida form the upper surface is matt and silky and the mushroom as a whole is flaccid. In the inversa form the surface is shiny and the mushroom is rigid. *The gills are decurrent and closely packed. They are a similar hue to the cap, but paler. The spore print is white or pale pink. *The stem is up to about 7 cm long and about 0.8 cm thick, a similar colour to the cap. *The smell is agreeably mushroomy and the taste is mild. =Microscopic characteristics= The spores are almost spherical with small spines or warts, about 4.5 µm in diameter. There are no distinctive cystidia. There is no microscopic difference between the flaccida and inversa forms. =Distribution, habitat & ecology= This fungus is a saprobe growing on humus-rich soil, compost or conifer needles from summer to autumn. The flaccida form grows in deciduous woods and the inversa form under conifers. Often numerous mushrooms \\"fruit\\" together and it may form fairy rings. It is most frequent in Europe where it is common. It also occurs in the U.S.A. and there have been reports of it from Mexico, and Australia. =Similar species= Paralepista gilva The inversa form is sometimes regarded as a separate species, in which case it is distinguished because it grows under conifers rather than broad-leaved trees, has a shinier cap surface, and is more rigid (less flaccid). Both forms are closely allied to Paralepista gilva (also edible) which can be identified by its yellower cap and stem, and the presence of dark spots on the cap surface. P. flaccida is also similar to the edible Infundibulicybe gibba which has thinner flesh, less crowded gills, and (microscopically) smooth teardrop-shaped spores. More worrying for consumers of this species is the resemblance to the poisonous Paralepistopsis amoenolens, which however seems to be limited in distribution to North Africa, southern France and southern Italy. P. amoenolens has a strong characteristic smell, a beige colour, and a less depressed cap; also the spores are smooth. Human uses According to Marcel Bon this is a good edible mushroom, but other commentators are less enthusiastic, regarding it as poor. In relevant regions care should be taken to avoid confusion with Paralepistopsis amoenolens. Relating to pest control, a substance called clitolactone or 5-(chloromethyl)-3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone, which is claimed to inhibit banana slug feeding behaviour, has been isolated from P. flaccida.

It was published by Losada in Buenos Aires in 1958, received the Peruvian National Culture Award (Premio Nacional de Cultura) in 1959, and was a finalist in the William Faulkner Foundation Ibo-American award (1963). Since then, critical interest in the work of Arguedas has grown, and the book has been translated into several languages.Vargas Llosa 1996, p. 195. According to critics, this novel marked the beginning of the current neo-indigenista movement, which presented, for the first time, a reading of indigenous issues from a closer perspective. Most critics agree that this novel is one of Arguedas' masterpieces. The title of the work ('Uku Mayu' in Quechua) alludes to the depth of the Andean rivers, which rise in the top of the Andes. It also relates to the solid and ancestral roots of Andean culture, which, according to Arguedas, are the true national identity of Peru. Context The last years of the 1950s were very fertile for Arguedas' literary production. The book appeared when Indigenismo was in full swing in Peru. Education Minister at the time, Luis E. Valcárcel, organized the Culture Museum, an institution that contributed decisively to indigenous studies. Moreover, with the publication of Deep Rivers, the growing reception to Arguedas' work began, both in Peru and throughout the continent.Jessica Tapia Soriano: Guía de lectura de El Comercio, Nº 19, 2001. Composition The genesis of the novel was the story 'Warma kuyay\\" (part of the collection of short stories entitled 'Water', published in 1935), one of whose characters is the child Ernesto. This Ernesto is unmistakably the same as the Deep Rivers character. A text of Arguedas which was published in 1948 in the form of autobiography (Las Moradas, vol. II, No. 4, Lima, April 1948, pp. 53-59), took shape as the second chapter of the novel under the title 'Los Viajes'. In 1950 Arguedas wrote the essay 'The novel and the problem of literary expression in Peru' (La novela y el problema de la expresion literaria en el Peru), in which he announced the existence of the novel project. The push to complete the novel emerged years later in 1956, while conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the Mantaro Valley. He then worked hard to its completion. Some texts of ethnographic study were attached to the story, such as the etymological explanation of 'zumbayllu' or magical spinning top. Plot The novel describes the maturation process of Ernesto, a 14-year-old who must confront the injustices of the adult world that he becomes a part of, and who is required to take sides. The story begins in Cuzco, where Ernesto and his father Gabriel arrive. Gabriel, an itinerant lawyer, is looking for a rich relative called 'El Viejo' (the old one), in order to ask for work and shelter. But he does not succeed. He then recommences his wanderings through many cities and villages of southern Peru. In Abancay, Ernesto is enrolled as a boarder at a religious school while his father continues his travels in search of work. Ernesto then has to live with the boarding students who are a microcosm of Peruvian society and where cruel and violent behaviour is the norm. Later, outside the boundaries of the school, a group of chicheras mutiny, demanding the distribution of salt, and a mass of Indian peasants enter the city to ask for a mass for the victims of epidemic typhus. This pushes Ernesto into a profound awareness: he must choose the values of liberation rather than economic security. This completes a phase of the learning process. The novel ends when Ernesto leaves Abancay and goes to a ranch owned by \\"El Viejo\\", situated in the valley of the Apurimac, awaiting the return of his father. Analysis > \\"With deep rivers Arguedas's work reached a wide continental distribution. > This novel fully develops the lyrical potentialities that lay in Arguedas' > prose from the beginning. Offering the story from the perspective of an > introverted teenage character, to some extent autobiographical, this > narrative of internal examination presents however, from its first line, a > distressing reflection on reality, on the nature of the Andean world and its > relations with westernized sectors.

With regard to the revelation of the meaning of the Indian reality, > Deep Rivers repeats certain dimensions of Yawar Fiesta, Arguedas's previous > novel: its contextualization within the Andean, the emphasis on the > opposition between such a universe and the coastal one, the assertion of > power and the Quechua people of the Andean culture, etc. The chapters > recounting the revolt of the chicheras and settlers insist on showing that > hidden capacity.

In > this respect the novel functions as a dazzling lyrical operation. Deep > Rivers is not the most important work of Arguedas; it is however, without a > doubt, the most beautiful and perfect.\\"Antonio Cornejo Polar, pp. 129-130. Style and Narrative Technique Mario Vargas Llosa, who along with Carlos Eduardo Zavaleta was the first to develop the \\"modern novel\\" in Peru, recognizes that Arguedas, although not developing modern techniques in his narratives, is nevertheless much more modern than other writers who respond to the characteristic nineteenth century classical model, that of the \\"traditional novel\\", as in the case of Ciro Alegría. Vargas Llosa says of it: > \\"With the stories Agua (Water) and Los rios profundos (Deep Rivers), after > the progress he had made Yawar Fiesta, Arguedas had perfected his style as > much as his technical resources, which, without spectacular innovations or > experimental daring, still reached full functionality in this novel. [These > technical recources] provide the persuasive power without which no fiction > can come alive before the reader nor pass the test of time.\\"Vargas Llosa > 1996, pp. 178-179. Vargas Llosa recognizes the emotional impact reading Deep Rivers left him, which unambiguously qualifies it as a masterpiece. Vargas Llosa also highlights Arguedas mastery of the Spanish language in this novel to reach a style of great artistic effectiveness. It is a functional and flexible Spanish, which brings to light the different shades of a plurality of issues, people and peculiarities of the world exposed in the work. Arguedas, a bilingual writer, succeeds in \\"quechuization\\" of Spanish: what some characters say in Quechua is translated to Spanish, sometimes including those speeches in italics in the original language. This does not happen often, but as often as needed to make the reader see that these are two cultures with two different languages.Vargas Llosa 1996, pp. 176-177. The zumbayllu The zumbayllu or spinning top is the quintessential magical element of the novel. > \\"The ball (of the top) was made of a store-bought coconut, from those tiny > grey coconuts that come in cans; the spike was large and thin. Four round > holes, like eyes, emanated from the sphere.\\" These holes produce the typical buzzing sound when spun, which give the object its name. There is also a more powerful type of zumbayllu made from a deformed object but without being round (winku) and with the quality of sorcery (layka). For Ernesto, the zumbayllu is the ideal instrument for capturing the interplay between objects. As such, its functions are varied, but it is first used to send messages to distant places. Ernesto believes that his voice can reach the ears of his absent father by chanting the zumbayllu. It is also a pacifying object, a symbol of restoring order, as in the episode where Ernesto gives his zumbayllu to Anauco. But it is also a purifying element of negative spaces, and it is under that belief that Ernesto buries his zumbayllu in the backyard of the toilets, in the same place where older inmates sexually abused a mentally disabled woman. The zumbayllu purifies the land and flowers start to sprout, which Ernesto then decides to place in the woman's tomb. Notes References * Arguedas, José María Arguedas: Los ríos profundos.

It was opened as an upmarket hotel for the booming town in 1882. Since then it has had a complex history. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property in the Las Vegas Plaza historic district. Location The Plaza Hotel is on the north side of the old town plaza in Las Vegas, originally an area where wagons were parked. The town was founded in the 1830s. During the Mexican–American War, in 1846 Stephen W. Kearny gave a speech on the plaza where he proclaimed that New Mexico was part of the United States. The town remained relatively small and quiet for many years. This changed when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached the town in 1879, with a station to the east of the plaza. In 1880, after a campaign by the local newspaper, The Las Vegas Optic, a public subscription was raised to convert the plaza into a park. Trees were planted, a bandstand was built and the plaza surrounded by a picket fence. Construction By 1882 the town's population had grown to six thousand. The Plaza Hotel was built that year by a group of businessmen led by Don Benigno Romero. The local merchant Carlos Blanchard was among the partners. Construction cost $25,000. The Plaza is a three-story brick building with an Italianate facade. The hotel was grandly decorated, with high-ceilinged guest rooms. The lobby was connected to the second floor by towering twin staircases. The first floor balcony had ornate iron railings, since removed. It was advertised as the finest hotel in the territory. The Plaza was often called the \\"Belle of the Southwest\\". History View from the park In 1883 Charles Ilfeld opened his Great Emporium, a three-story department store, next door to the hotel. The plaza was the commercial center of the region for the next thirty years. In 1885 the former outlaw Dick Liddil (1852–1901) sold his saloon in West Las Vegas and leased the Plaza Hotel's bar and billiard room. The Plaza was the leading hotel in Las Vegas until the late 1890s, when Santa Fe Railroad built the luxurious La Castañeda, which was operated by Fred Harvey as part of the Harvey House chain. By the end of the 1890s Las Vegas rivaled Denver, El Paso and Tucson in importance. The dry climate of Las Vegas began to attract invalids suffering from pulmonary ailments, particularly tuberculosis, for which no other cure was known. By the 1890s many of the guests at the Plaza were convalescent victims of tuberculosis. The One Lung Club was organized at the hotel in the 1890s to provide social activities for the invalids that did not require exertion. The first reunion of Theodore Roosevelt’s Rough Riders was held at the Plaza Hotel in 1899. Roosevelt stayed at the hotel twice, and announced his presidential candidacy from Las Vegas. The hotel was used in many cowboy films, including Tom Mix westerns. From 1913 to 1915 the silent film director and actor Romaine Fielding leased the entire hotel, and renamed it the Hotel Romaine. It is still possible to see traces of that name on the brick facade. The first film than Fielding made in Las Vegas was The Rattlesnake, a story about two rivals in love. Four more shorts were made within the next month. His five-reel thriller The Golden God employed about 5,000 local extras and featured a cavalry and artillery charge through the streets of the old town. The print for the film was lost in a fire, and there are no surviving copies. Mrs. Lucy Lopez, known as Mama Lucy to her friends, ran the Plaza Hotel Restaurant and Bar for fourteen years with her husband. They rented part of the hotel as a dormitory for New Mexico Highlands University students and sold meal tickets for the restaurant as an alternative to the university cafeteria. Daily lunch and dinner cost $30 a month. Students who were short of money could make a special arrangement in exchange for helping out. Recent years Plaza Hotel entrance In 1982 the hotel was restored by new owners, giving thirty six guest rooms and a fine dining room. The adjoining building was purchased later, adding another thirty five rooms and of space for meetings and banquets. The rooms in the new Ilfeld section are more modern than in the older part of the hotel which holds its comfy luster. In 2006 the hotel had a restaurant and a lobby bar named Byron T's after the former owner Byron T. Mills, whose ghost is said to haunt the building. Several scenes of the 2007 film No Country for Old Men feature the Plaza Hotel. In March 2014 it was reported that the entrepreneur Allan Affeldt was investigating purchase of the hotel from the Valley National Bank in Española, which held an outstanding $3.7 million note on the property. Affeldt was also looking at buying and restoring its former rival, the vacant Castañeda Hotel. The Plaza Hotel is registered on the National Register of Historic Places.

The current is informally referred to as the Pathfinder tendency because its members operate Pathfinder Bookstores which sell the products of the SWP's publishing arm, Pathfinder Press. The current is also known as the International Communist League, although this term is not widely used, and can cause confusion with other organizations of the same name. The Communist Leagues, even those in non-English-speaking countries, sell the publication of the SWP, The Militant.  History  In the 1980s, the Socialist Workers Party and its international supporters within the Fourth International (FI) broke from many of the traditional positions of Trotskyism, including the theory of Permanent Revolution, and embraced positions that marked a political convergence with the Cuban Communist Party and the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional. Upon adopting these new positions, the SWP expelled supporters of the FI from the party, and SWP supporters abroad split from or attempted to take over sections of the FI in various countries. By the late 1980s, this process was completed and national sections of the FI had either been taken over with supporters of the international's mainstream being expelled--this happened with the Revolutionary Workers League in Canada, the Socialist Action League in New Zealand and the SWP in the US--or supporters of the US SWP had split from FI sections and founded their own organisations -- as occurred in Australia, Sweden and Britain. In 1990, the SWP and its supporters formally left the FI. Supporters of the SWP internationally renamed their organisations the Communist League in each country. Since the creation of the Pathfinder tendency, new Communist Leagues have formed to organise previously existing groups of supporters in Iceland and in France (1999). The Youth sections of the Pathfinder Tendency are increasingly active in the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

Publication history  = Forerunners = An earlier publication called The Militant was launched in November 1928 by James P. Cannon and other American Trotskyists gathered together in the Communist League of America (CLA). It declared its goal to be a fight \\"in the interest of the working people\\" against the capitalist system, imperialist wars, and the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, which according to the Trotskyists had betrayed and corrupted the October Revolution. The original Militant terminated in 1934 at the time of the merger of the Cannon-led CLA with the American Workers Party headed by A. J. Muste to form the Workers Party of the United States (WPUS). The paper was succeeded by a similar broadsheet that served as the official organ of the WPUS called the New Militant, edited by Cannon. This paper was in turn terminated after about 18 months when the main section of the WPUS joined the Socialist Party of America en masse in 1936 and was replaced by a new publication Socialist Appeal by Trotskyists in the SPA. Albert Goldman edited the Chicago-based publication from 1935, he and other Trotskyists in Chicago had joined the SPA prior to the rest of the WPUS. In 1937, the newspaper was transferred to New York City. = Current publication = The Socialist Workers Party was founded on December 31, 1937, by Trotskyists following the expulsion of the \\"Socialist Appeal faction\\" from the Socialist Party of America. The SWP's newspaper continued to be known as Socialist Appeal until 1941 when it was renamed The Militant. This publication has continued without interruption into the decade of the 2010s. In the summer of 2005, The Militant became a bilingual newspaper, published in both English and Spanish (El Militante), and with lead articles and editorials appearing in both languages. A French edition was inaugurated in 2012 named Le Militant. The Militant is not officially owned or controlled by the SWP. To protect the party and the paper, The Militant is owned by a private group, although the endorsement the paper gives to the SWP is clear.

Khomeini took over unacknowledged Yazdi's idea, and on August 7, 1979, he declared the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan each year as Quds Day, in which Muslims worldwide would unite in solidarity against Israel and in support of the Palestinians. Khomeini declared the \\"liberation\\" of Jerusalem a religious duty to all Muslims. That day, he stated: There have been recorded incidents of violence on Quds Day, including 28 people killed and 326 wounded by bombs in 1985 during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran celebrates the event characteristically by putting on public display poster images of the city of Jerusalem, thematic speeches, art exhibitions reflecting the issue, and folkloric events. In Lebanon, the Hezbollah organization marks the occasion by a substantive military parade organized for the last week of Ramadan. Since 1989, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan observes the event by hosting academic conferences, whose venue from university to university varies each year. Arab societies generally pay the occasion lip service in order to make a show of solidarity with the cause of Palestinian aspirations for nationhood.Yitzhak Reiter, Jerusalem and Its Role in Islamic Solidarity, Springer, 2008 p.142. Quds Day has actually become a day for protestors in Iran and in other societies \\"to attack the legitimacy of the state of Israel and threaten the United States\\". The day is also marked throughout Muslim and Arab countries. During the First Intifada in January 1988, the Jerusalem Committee of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference decided that Quds Day should be commemorated in public events throughout the Arab world. In countries with significant Shi'a populations, particularly Lebanon, where Hezbollah organizes Quds Day observances, there is significant attendance at the day's events. Events are also held in Iraq, the Palestinian Gaza Strip, and Syria. Hamas, and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine endorse Quds Day, and hold ceremonies. Outside of the Middle East and the wider Arab World, Quds Day protests have taken place in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Sweden, France, the United States, as well as some predominantly Muslim countries in east Asia. According to the BBC, while the idea behind Quds Day originally was to gather all Muslims in opposition to the existence of Israel, the event has not developed beyond an Iranian experience. Apart from rallies, usually funded and organized by Iran itself, in various capital cities, the ritual never took root among Muslims at large. Quds Day events In Iran, the day's parades are sponsored and organized by the government.Iranians rally on 'al-Quds Day', aljazeera.net, (September 18, 2009 )Iran eyewitness: protest videos, BBC, (September 18, 2009) Events include mass marches and rallies. Senior Iranian leaders give fiery speeches condemning Israel, as well as the U.S. government. The crowds respond with chants of \\"Death to Israel\\", and \\"Death to America\\". According to Roger Howard, many Iranians under the age of 30 continue to participate in Quds Day events, though proportionately less than those on the streets. He adds that many Iranian students on campus say in private that the Arab–Israeli conflict has \\"nothing to do with us.\\"Roger Howard, Iran in Crisis?: The Future of the Revolutionary Regime and the US Response, Zed Books (2004). . p. 49. Quds Day protests have been held in parts of the Middle East and in London and Berlin and the United States. Marches in London have drawn up to 3,000 people, while Berlin saw 1,600 protestors in 2018. Rallies were held in at least 18 cities across the United States in 2017. In 2020, for the first time since the initiation four decades ago, the Quds day event was held virtually in Iran amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Its caput was at Cardinham Castle, Cornwall. The Barony was held in recent times by the Vivian family, the last being Nicholas Vivian, 6th Baron Vivian. Brigadier Nicholas Crespigny Laurence Vivian, 6th Baron Vivian (11 December 1935 - 28 February 2004), conveyed the title to John Anthony Vincent of Edifici Maxim's, Carrer General, Arsinal, Principat Andora, in 1995. Mr. Vincent was a member of the Manorial Society of Great Britain and died in Douglas, Isle of Man, on 31 March 2018. The Barony was then conveyed after the probate of his estate to an American citizen on 25 May 2019.

This was the opinion of Leland (died 1552) who writing of Robert de Cardinan as founder of Tywardreath Priory, called him quidam ex Dinamiis (\\"a certain (man) from the Dinam (family)\\")Quoted in Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.3: Cornwall, 1814, Extinct peers and baronial families Moreover, Lysons (1814) pointed out a further factor giving this opinion validity in that the arms of the two families were similar. Cardinan was later quartered by their descendants the Prideaux family of Prideaux Place, Cornwall, as Sable, three lozenges in fesse ermine, whilst the arms of Dynham were Gules, four lozenges in fesse ermine.Quoted in Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.3: Cornwall, 1814, Extinct peers and baronial families, note 4 It was suggested to Lysons (1814) by Mr Austen, of Place-House, in Fowey, that the Castle was named by its builder, possibly a member of the Dynham family who had inherited the property by marriage to the FitzWilliam heiress, Car - Dinham.Quoted in Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.3: Cornwall, 1814, Extinct peers and baronial families, note 5 *Richard Fitz Turold (died post 1103-6) * William Fitz Richard, possibly son and heir, mentioned in deeds in 1110 and 1130, date of death unknown.Sanders, p.110 It has been suggested that William's daughter and heiress became the wife of Reginald, Earl of Cornwall.Sanders, p.110, note 2 *Robert FitzWilliam (died c. 1169–77), recorded in 1166 Cartae Baronum to be holder of lands formerly held by Richard FitzTurold.

For brevity, it is usually called the Petrograd Soviet (, Petrogradskiy soviet). The soviet was established in March 1917 after the February Revolution as a representative body of the city's workers and soldiers, while the city already had its well established city council, the Saint Petersburg City Duma (Central Duma). During the revolutionary days, the council tried to extend its jurisdiction nationwide as a rival power center to the Provisional Government, creating what in Soviet historiography is known as the Dvoyevlastiye (Dual power). Its committees were key components during the Russian Revolution and some of them led the armed revolt of the October Revolution. Formation Before 1914, Petrograd was known as Saint Petersburg, and in 1905 the workers' soviet called the St Petersburg Soviet was created. But the main precursor to the 1917 Petrograd Soviet was the Central Workers' Group (Центральная Рабочая Группа, Tsentral'naya Rabochaya Gruppa), founded in November 1915 by the Mensheviks to mediate between workers and the new Central Military-Industrial Committee in Petrograd. The group became increasingly radical as World War I progressed and the economic situation worsened, encouraging street demonstrations and issuing revolutionary proclamations. On January 27, 1917 (all dates Old Style) the entire leadership of the Central Workers' Group was arrested and taken to the Peter and Paul Fortress on the orders of Alexander Protopopov, the Minister of the Interior in Imperial Russia. They were freed by a crowd of disaffected soldiers on the morning of February 27, the beginning of the February Revolution, and the chairman convened a meeting to organize and elect a Soviet of Workers' Deputies that day. That evening, between 50 and 300 people attended the meeting at the Tauride Palace. A provisional executive committee (Ispolkom) was chosen, named \\"Provisional Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies\\" and chaired by Nikolay Chkheidze, and with mostly Menshevik deputies. (Chkheize was replaced by Irakli Tsereteli in late March). Izvestia was chosen as the official newspaper of the group. The following day, February 28, was the plenary session; elected representatives from factories and the military joined the soviet, and again moderates dominated. Non-representative voting and enthusiasm gave the Soviet almost 3,000 deputies in two weeks, of which the majority were soldiers. The meetings were chaotic, confused and unruly, little more than a stage for speechmakers. The party-based Ispolkom quickly took charge of actual decision- making. =Chairmen= * Nikolay Chkheidze, March 12 – September 19, 1917 * Leon Trotsky, . – * Grigory Zinoviev, December 13, 1917 – March 26, 1926 =Executive committee= The members of the Executive Committee, called Ispolkom, came only from political groups, with every socialist party given three seats (agreed March 18). This created an intellectual and radical head to the peasant-, worker-, and soldier-dominated body. The Executive Committee meetings were more intense and almost as disorderly as the public meetings, and were often extremely long. On March 1, the Executive Committee resolved to remain outside any new State Duma. This allowed the group to criticize without responsibility, and kept them away from any potential backlash. On March 2, the Soviet received the eight-point program of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma, appointed an oversight committee (nabliudatel'nyi komitet), and issued a decidedly conditional statement of support. Moreover, the Soviet undermined the Provisional Government by issuing its own orders, beginning with the seven-article Order No. 1. The Soviet was not opposed to the war - internal divisions produced a public ambivalence-but was deeply worried about counterrevolutionary moves from the military, and was determined to have garrison troops firmly on its side. =Other committees= * Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee (Milrevkom) * Committee on Revolutionary Defense Power struggle with the Provisional Government The Petrograd Soviet developed into an alternate source of authority to the Provisional Government under (Prince) Georgy Lvov and later Alexander Kerensky. This created a situation described as dvoevlastie (dual power), in which the Petrograd Soviet competed for legitimacy with the Provisional Government until the October Revolution. The Ispolkom (the \\"executive committee\\") of the Petrograd Soviet often publicly attacked the Provisional Government as bourgeois and boasted of its de facto power over de jure authority (control over post, telegraphs, the press, railroads, food supply, and other infrastructure). A \\"shadow government\\" with a Contact Commission was created on March 8 to \\"inform... [the Provisional Government] about the demands of the revolutionary people, to exert pressure on the government to dissatisfy all these demands, and to exercise uninterrupted control over their implementation.\\" On March 19, the control extended into the military front lines with commissars appointed with Ministry of War support. In March 1917, the Petrograd Soviet was opposed to the workers, which protested its deliberations with strikes. On March 8, the Menshevik newspaper Rabochaia Gazeta even claimed that the strikers were discrediting the soviet by disobeying it.Tony Cliff Lenin 2 Chapter 12 Lenin and Workers’ Control, section The Rise of Factory Committees The Ispolkom expanded to 19 members on April 8, nine representing the Soldiers' Section, and ten the Workers' Section. All members were socialists, the majority Mensheviks or Socialist- Revolutionaries; there was no Bolshevik representation. After the first All- Russian Congress of Soviets (June/July 1917), the Petrograd Soviet began adding representatives from other parts of Russia and the front lines, renaming itself the All-Russian Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. The executive committee became the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (CEC or VTsIK) with over 70 members (but no peasant representatives). The mass meetings of the body tapered from daily in the first weeks to roughly weekly by April. Rise of the Bolsheviks The rise of the Bolsheviks throughout 1917 is known as the Bolshevization of soviets. The Bolsheviks rapidly assumed the mantle of the official opposition, and took advantage of the new socialist presence in the Cabinet to attack them for the failures of the Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks began a strong run of propaganda. In June, 100,000 copies of Pravda (including Soldatskaya Pravda, Golos Pravdy, and Okopnaya Pravda) were printed daily. In July, over 350,000 leaflets were distributed. The July Days riots from July 16–17, inspired but not led by the Bolsheviks, were without success. The rise of Kerensky, and the later shock of the Kornilov affair, polarized the political scene. The Petrograd Soviet moved steadily leftwards, just as those of the center and right consolidated around Kerensky. Despite the events in July, the Ispolkom moved to protect the Bolsheviks from serious consequences, adopting resolutions on August 4 and August 18 against the arrest and prosecution of Bolsheviks. Still wary of the Ispolkom, the government released many senior Bolsheviks on bail or promise of good behavior. In the August 20 municipal elections, the Bolsheviks took a third of the votes, a 50% increase in three months. During the Kornilov affair, the Ispolkom was forced to use the Bolsheviks' military as its main force against the \\"counter-revolution\\". Kerensky ordered the distribution of 40,000 rifles to the workers of Petrograd (some Red Guards), many of which ended in the hands of Bolshevik groups. As other socialist parties abandoned the Soviet organizations, the Bolsheviks increased their presence. On September 25, they gained a majority in the Workers' Section and Leon Trotsky was elected chairman. He directed the transformation of the Soviet into a revolutionary organ according to Bolshevik policies. October days of 1917 Milrevcom proclamation about the disbanding of the Russian Provisional Government On October 6, with a German advance threatening the city, the government - after advice from the military - made plans to evacuate to Moscow. The Ispolkom attacked the move, and Trotsky had the soldiers' section, who were mostly Mensheviks, vote on a resolution condemning the evacuation. The Provisional Government postponed evacuation indefinitely. Its attempts to dispatch Petrograd garrison units to the front were resisted by the troops and by the Ispolkom. On October 9, the Soviet considered the creation of a Committee of Revolutionary Defense. The Bolsheviks and Trotsky amended the resolution to include security of Petrograd against both German and domestic threats. The Plenum of the Soviet voted for a committee to \\"gather... all the forces participating in the defense of Petrograd... to arm the workers... ensuring the revolutionary defense of Petrograd... against the... military and civilian Kornilovites.\\" The Ispolkom approved the resolution, against Menshevik resistance, on October 12, and the Soviet approved it on October 16 (despite warnings by the Mensheviks and SRs), creating the Military Revolutionary Committee (Voenno-Revoliutsionnyi Komitet), also called the Milrevcom or Military Committee. The Military-Revolutionary Committee was chaired by Pavel Lazimir, with Nikolai Podvoisky as his deputy. It was a front for the activities of the Bolshevik's Military Organization. Podvoisky would take official control of the Committee on the day of the uprising, with Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko as secretary. The Ispolkom and the Provisional Government had been cut out of control of the forces in the Petrograd Military District, since very few of them remained loyal to them. The Military Staff was side-lined on the night of October 21, when the Milrevcom took exclusive control of the garrison in the name of the Soldiers' Section of the Soviet. The District commander, Colonel Polkovnikov, refused to allow this control, and he and his staff were condemned in a Milrevcom public statement as \\"a direct weapon of the counter-revolutionary forces\\". The military command responded with an ultimatum to the Soviet, which led to delaying negotiations and meetings on October 23 and 24. The Bolshevik-popular uprising began on October 24, when \\"liberal\\" forces tried to shut down Pravda and take other steps to secure the government. The Milrevcom sent armed groups to seize the main telegraph offices and lower the bridges across the Neva. That night, the Bolsheviks took control quickly and easily, since the vast majority of both the guard and the workers had sided with them, participating in the plans of the \\"Milrevcom\\". The following morning at 10am, the Milrevcom issued an announcement written by Lenin, declaring the end of the Provisional Government and the transfer of power to the Petrograd Soviet. In the early afternoon, Trotsky convened an Extraordinary Session of the Petrograd Soviet, to preempt the Congress of Soviets. It was packed with Bolsheviks and Left SR deputies. That evening, the Second Congress of Soviets opened in the Assembly Hall in Smolnyi. The 600 or so delegates chose a Presidium of 3 Mensheviks and 21 Bolsheviks and Left SRs. The following day, the Ispolkom rejected the workings of the Congress and called on the Soviets and the army to defend the Revolution. But in the evening, the Congress dismissed the Ispolkom and replaced it by a new group of 101 members (62 Bolsheviks) under Lev Borisovich Kamenev. It also approved the Decree on Peace, the Decree on Land and the formation of a new government – the Council of People's Commissars (Sovet Narodnykh Komissarov, abbreviated to Sovnarkom) – until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly. The Sovnarkom was accountable to the CEC/VTsIK in theory, but the organization was in every aspect powerless.

A counter-revolutionary or an anti-revolutionary is anyone who opposes a revolution, particularly one who acts after a revolution in order to try to overturn it or reverse its course, in full or in part. The adjective, \\"counter-revolutionary\\", pertains to movements that would restore the state of affairs, or the principles, that prevailed during a prerevolutionary era. A counter-revolution can be positive or negative in its consequences; depending, in part, on the beneficent or pernicious character of the revolution that gets reversed, and the nature of those affected. For example, the transitory success of Agis and Cleomenes of ancient Sparta in restoring the constitution of Lycurgus was considered by Plutarch to be counter-revolutionary in a positive sense. During the French Revolution the Jacobins saw the Counter-revolution in the Vendée as distinctly negative, whilst it was strongly supported by the exiled Royalists, the Catholic Church, and the people of the provinces.  Europe  =France= The word \\"counter- revolutionary\\" originally referred to thinkers who opposed themselves to the 1789 French Revolution, such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald or, later, Charles Maurras, the founder of the Action française monarchist movement. More recently, it has been used in France to describe political movements that reject the legacy of the 1789 Revolution, which historian René Rémond has referred to as légitimistes. Thus, monarchist supporters of the Ancien Régime following the French Revolution were counter-revolutionaries, as were supporters of the Revolt in the Vendée and of the monarchies that put down the various Revolutions of 1848. The royalist legitimist counter-revolutionary French movement survives to this day, albeit marginally. It was active during the purported \\"Révolution nationale\\" enacted by Vichy France, though, which has been considered by René Rémond not as a fascist regime but as a counter- revolutionary regime, whose motto was Travail, Famille, Patrie (\\"Work, Family, Fatherland\\"), which replaced the Republican motto Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité. After the French Revolution, anti-clerical policies and the execution of King Louis XVI led to the Revolt in the Vendee. This counter- revolution produced what is debated to be the first modern genocide. Monarchists and Catholics took up arms against the revolutionaries' French Republic in 1793 after the government asked that 300,000 Vendeans be conscripted into the Republican military. The Vendeans also rose up against Napoleon's attempt to conscript them in 1815. =Great Britain= Many historians have held that the rise and spread of Methodism in Great Britain prevented the development of a revolution there. In addition to preaching the Christian Gospel, John Wesley and his Methodist followers visited those imprisoned, as well as the poor and aged, building hospitals and dispensaries which provided free healthcare for the masses. The sociologist William H. Swatos stated that \\"Methodist enthusiasm transformed men, summoning them to assert rational control over their own lives, while providing in its system of mutual discipline the psychological security necessary for autonomous conscience and liberal ideals to become internalized, an integrated part of the 'new men' ... regenerated by Wesleyan preaching.\\" The practice of temperance among Methodists, as well as their rejection of gambling, allowed them to eliminate secondary poverty and accumulate capital. Individuals who attended Methodist chapels and Sunday schools \\"took into industrial and political life the qualities and talents they had developed within Methodism and used them on behalf of the working classes in non-revolutionary ways.\\" The spread of the Methodist Church in Great Britain, author and professor Michael Hill states, \\"filled both a social and an ideological vacuum\\" in English society, thus \\"opening up the channels of social and ideological mobility ... which worked against the polarization of English society into rigid social classes.\\" The historian Bernard Semmel argues that \\"Methodism was an antirevolutionary movement that succeeded (to the extent that it did) because it was a revolution of a radically different kind\\" that was capable of effecting social change on a large scale. =Italy= In Italy, after being conquered by Napoleon's army in the late 18th century, there was a counter- revolution in all the French client republics. The most well-known was the Sanfedismo, reactionary movement led by the cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, which overthrew the Parthenopean Republic and allowed the Bourbon dynasty to return to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples. A resurgence of the phenomenon happened during the Napoleon's second Italian campaign in the early 19th century. Another example of counter-revolution was the peasants rebellion in Southern Italy after the national unification, fomented by the Bourbon government in exile and the Papal States. The revolt, labelled pejoratively by opponents as brigandage, resulted in a bloody civil war that lasted almost ten years. =Austria= In the Austrian empire, revolt took place against Napoleon called the Tyrolean Rebellion in 1809. Led by a Tyrolean innkeeper by the name of Andreas Hofer, 20,000 Tyrolean Rebels fought successfully against Napoleon's troops. However, Hofer was ultimately betrayed by the Treaty of Schönbrunn, which led to the disbandment of his troops and was captured and executed in 1810. =Spain= The Spanish Civil War was in some respects, a counter-revolution. Supporters of Carlism, monarchy, and nationalism (see Falange) joined forces against the (Second) Spanish Republic in 1936. The counter-revolutionaries saw the Spanish Constitution of 1931 as a revolutionary document that defied Spanish culture, tradition and religion. On the Republican side, the acts of the Communist Party of Spain against the rural collectives can also be considered counter-revolutionary. The Carlist cause began with the First Carlist War in 1833 and continues to the present. =Russia= Red Army troops attack Kronstadt sailors in March 1921. The White Army and its supporters who tried to defeat the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution, as well as the German politicians, police, soldiers and Freikorps who crushed the German Revolution of 1918–1919, were also counter- revolutionaries. The Bolshevik government tried to build an anti-revolutionary image for the Green armies composed of peasant rebels.Radkey, Unknown Civil War, 78–80, 104–7, 407. The largest peasant rebellion against Bolshevik rule occurred in 1920–21 in Tambov. Hispanic America General Victoriano Huerta, and later the Felicistas, attempted to thwart the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s. In the late 1920s, Mexican Catholics took up arms against the Mexican Federal Government in what became known as the Cristero War. The President of Mexico, Plutarco Elias Calles, was elected in 1924. Calles began carrying out anti-Catholic policies which caused peaceful resistance from Catholics in 1926. The counter-revolution began as a movement of peaceful resistance against the anti-clerical laws. In the Summer of 1926, fighting broke out. The fighters known as Cristeros fought the government due to its suppression of the Church, jailing and execution of priests, formation of a nationalist schismatic church, state atheism, Socialism, Freemasonry and other harsh anti- Catholic policies. The 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion into Cuba was conducted by counter-revolutionaries who hoped to overthrow the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. In the 1980s, the Contra-Revolución rebels fighting to overthrow the revolutionary Sandinista government in Nicaragua. In fact, the Contras received their name precisely because they were counter-revolutionaries. The Black Eagles, the AUC, and other paramilitary movements of Colombia can also be seen as counter-revolutionary. These right-wing groups are opposition to the FARC, and other left-wing guerrilla movements. Some counter- revolutionaries are former revolutionaries who supported the initial overthrow of the previous regime, but came to differ with those who ultimately came to power after the revolution. For example, some of the Contras originally fought with the Sandinistas to overthrow Anastasio Somoza, and some of those who oppose Castro also opposed Batista.  China  The anti-communist Kuomintang party in China used the term \\"counter-revolutionary\\" to disparage the communists and other opponents of its regime. Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang party leader, was the chief user of this term. The Kuomintang had several influences left upon its ideology by revolutionary thinking. The Kuomintang, and Chiang Kai-shek used the words \\"feudal\\" and \\"counter-revolutionary\\" as synonyms for evil, and backwardness, and proudly proclaimed themselves to be revolutionary. Chiang called the warlords feudalists, and called for feudalism and counter-revolutionaries to be stamped out by the Kuomintang. Chiang showed extreme rage when he was called a warlord, because of its negative, feudal connotations. Chiang also crushed and dominated the merchants of Shanghai in 1927, seizing loans from them, with the threats of death or exile. Rich merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs were arrested by Chiang, who accused them of being \\"counter-revolutionary\\", and Chiang held them until they gave money to the Kuomintang. Chiang's arrests targeted rich millionaires, accusing them of communism and counter-revolutionary activities. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending his agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese made items and fining them. He also disregarded the internationally protected International Settlement, putting cages on its borders in which he threatened to place the merchants. The Kuomintang's alliance with the Green Gang allowed it to ignore the borders of the foreign concessions. A similar term also existed in the People's Republic of China, which includes charges such collaborating with foreign forces and inciting revolts against the government. According to Article 28 of the Chinese constitution, The state maintains public order and suppresses treasonable and other counter-revolutionary activities; It penalizes actions that endanger public security and disrupt the socialist economy and other criminal activities, and punishes and reforms criminals. The term received wide usage during the Cultural Revolution, in which thousands of intellectuals and government officials were denounced as \\"counter-revolutionaries\\" by the Red Guards. Following the end of the Cultural Revolution, the term was also used to label Lin Biao and the Gang of Four.  Usage of the term  The word counter-revolutionary is often used interchangeably with reactionary; however, some reactionary people use the term counter-revolutionary to describe their opponents, even if those opponents were advocates of a revolution. In general, the word \\"reactionary\\" is used to describe those who oppose a more long-term trend of social change, while \\"counter-revolutionaries\\" are those who oppose a very recent and sudden change. The clerics who took power following the Iranian Revolution became counter-revolutionaries; after the revolution the Marxists were driven out of power by the mullahs. Thousands of political prisoners who opposed the Islamist regime were killed especially during the 1988 Massacre of Iranian Prisoners. Sometimes it is unclear who represents the revolution and who represents the counter-revolution. In Hungary, the 1956 uprising was condemned as a counter-revolution by the ruling Communist authorities (who claimed to be revolutionary themselves). However, thirty years later, the events of 1956 were more widely known as a revolution.  Footnotes and references  Further reading * Blum, Christopher Olaf, editor and translator, 2004.

Early life and family Georgiades was born in Thessaloniki and was an only child. Although his name was Athanasios, ‘Soulis’ was his artistic name. His father, Dimitri, was one of the four children of the village doctor at Rapsani, a village situated on the slopes of Mount Olympus. His mother, Maria, was a housewife and daughter of a small landowner at the district of Thessaloniki. Information regarding the family tree from the father's part dates back to about 17th century, when it seems that Kostis family from Mesolonghi, moves towards Thessaly. Constantine Kostis, born in 1733, changed his name to Hatzivassilis, probably as a result of a trip to the Holy Land (Jerusalem). Saint Giorgio Hatzilaskaris, neo-martyr executed by Veli Pasha on March 6, 1828 is included at the family tree as well. In 1870 Georgios Hatzivassilis changed the surname in Georgiades, in honour of Michael Georgiades, a native of Ambelakia (Turnavo) and a student (in Vienna in 1820) of Fereos Velenstilis (writer and journalist) as a sign of friendship and respect; who will later be the first martyr of the independence of Greece. The family tree from the grandmother's side, Domouza, includes Temistokle Domouza, commander of armatoliki (irregular armed) in the revolution of Thessaly in 1878 and boasts the origin from Ferigo Foscari. Career From a very young Soulis (only child) showed irresistible passion for cinema, organizing small shows and assiduously studied the history of cinema, not allowing them to lose any movie that was shown at Thessaloniki. After completing his studies at the Gymnasium of Thessaloniki, at the age of 17, with the moral support of the family and the mother's in particular, he went by train to Paris and enrolled at IDHEC (Institute for the Study of Cinematography) to where he completed his studies with success in 1956. He participated actively in the social life of the community of Greek students whilst studying in Paris and amongst them was Costas Gavras a dancer who moved from Paris directly to Rotterdam in order to embark as a sailor but Soulis convinced him to join the IDHEC. Other well- known figures were also there such as Dimitri Kollatos, Vassilis Vassilikos and others. In 1957, he met Maria Bianconi, daughter of the famous Italian painter Fulvio Bianconi and moved in Milan Italy to where they married in 1958. In 1959 Dimitri was born (the eldest son) and in 1961 Piero. Right from the beginning he started working as a commercial director, turning hundreds of advertisements and short films for a huge range of products and customers, such as Café' Bour Bon, Fratelli Fabbri Editori (Capire), shoe factory Helvetia, Sugoro Althea, I Grandi Viaggi, Saiwa, Encyclopedia of Women Formaggino D 'Oro Grunland, New Italian editions of ABC, Marina Julia and many others. Soulis was the first to include the female Singer Milva as a protagonist in an advertisement thus increasing national notoriety. Soulis was also friend and collaborator with Walter Chiari and other famous personas in the field. In 1962 he founded the 'Art Film’ production company in Milan through which he later produced most of the advertisements. With his advertisements he had a strong presence until 1966, which was broadcast by RAI after the news, and was dubbed by G. Evangelista, the patron of Telecolor of Rome, ‘the queen of the advertisement’. Soulis received awards and prizes such as the ‘Prix d’honor’ at the Film Festival in Trieste in 1962, first prize at the film festival of ‘humour’ in Bordighera 1963 as well as to the film festival of 'humour’ in Bordighera 1964. Moreover, the first prize in MIFED in Milan in 1964, the Oscar for best advertising series in Milan in 1964, and the first prize of the Presidency of the Council of the Republic (Italian) in 1964.

Career  After graduating from VSB-Technical University of Ostrava (VSB-TUO), he spent most of his life devoted to brown-coal mining research in then Czechoslovakia. At VSB-TUO he also earned the academic title of CSc (a Doctoral-equivalent degree). After the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, he became the director of the Brown Coal Research Institute (Výzkumný ústav pro hnědé uhlí) in Most. When the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade began to address the very poor situation at Mostecká uhelná společnost (MUS) in 1995, it started looking for a new CEO for the mining company. The winner of the selection procedure was Oldřich Klimecký, who was tasked with restructuring MUS as quickly as possible, so that for the future Czech power supply, mining would continue on prospective sites only and end everywhere else. Upon agreement with the representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the National Property Fund, the regions and major shareholders, all of whom were members of the Board of Directors of MUS, Oldřich Klimecký initiated fundamental changes in the management of the entire company and the company's transition to a market economy. In cooperation with the new management of MUS, he created new economic and business rules for MUS and succeeded in stabilising MUS within a few short years and securing its future. Oldřich Klimecký has long been interest in the development of the entire Most region and has supported the development of the municipalities located there. Under his direction, MUS provided financial support in the tens of millions of crowns. He was also greatly involved in the construction of the Hippodrome, which was built on former mining dumps. The Hippodrome project in Most, which is part of the Velebudice land rehabilitation park, is one of the most important projects of the Czech land rehabilitation school. Oldřich Klimecký has also long been engaged in politics in the Most region. He became a member of the Most municipal council in 1994, representing ODS. Oldřich Klimecký still lives in Most, now as a retiree and is no longer involved in either business or politics.  MUS case  In October 2013, he was sentenced to 37 months in prison by the Swiss court of first instance in Bellinzona for fraud and money laundering in connection with Appian's purchase of a minority package of MUS shares from the Czech government in 1999. Due to his advanced age and poor health, he has not attended any of the court hearings, always using the possibility to be represented by an attorney. As all of his assets and even part of his old-age pension have been seized in the Czech Republic due to the criminal proceedings, he has to be represented by an attorney appointed to him ex officio. After 15 years of continuous investigation, Oldřich Klimecký has given up on justice, lives a secluded life, does not comment on the case and does not communicate with the media.

The plaza was originally laid out in 1835 by Mexican settlers and is surrounded by a number of historically and architecturally notable buildings. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History Las Vegas was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the Mexican government. The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by adobe buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the Santa Fe Trail. During the Mexican–American War in 1846, Stephen W. Kearny delivered an address at the plaza from atop what is thought to be the surviving Dice Apartments building, claiming New Mexico for the United States. In 1854, visiting attorney W. W. H. Davis wrote that the plaza \\"more resembled a muddy field than a public square, and all sorts of four-footed domestic animals were roaming at large over it.\\" and Las Vegas prospered with the arrival of the railroad in 1880, and many of the one-story adobe buildings surrounding the plaza were replaced by larger and grander structures like the Italianate style Plaza Hotel and Ilfeld Building. During this period, the plaza itself was cleared of livestock and wagons and converted to a tidy public park with trees, fences, and a bandstand. Notable buildings Contributing properties in the Plaza historic district include *Plaza Hotel, built 1880 *Charles Ilfeld Building, built 1882 *Dice Apartments, the oldest surviving building on the plaza *John D.

It was built in a style to fit with the architecture of surrounding 1800s buildings and opened on September 2, 1986. Works by prominent artists are found throughout the hotel. Some of the guest rooms’ wood floor foyers were stencilled by the local artisan, Karl Beckwith Smith III. The “Quadriga” sculpture in the fountain at the front entrance (between Meeting and Hasell Street) is by John W. Mills, a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and the Royal Society of Arts. Its four 9-foot bronze horses represent the significance of the horse in Charleston’s history, as well as its present-day role. At the top of the sculpture is a Carolina bird of prey. Riviera Theatre The adjacent Art Deco Riviera Theatre is owned by Belmond Charleston Place and is a National Historic Landmark within the Charleston Historic District. Built in 1939, it was one of the first movie theatres in the city. The theatre eventually fell into disrepair and closed in 1977. Belmond Charleston Place purchased the theatre in 1995 and spent $5.5 million restoring the Art Deco landmark, uncovering murals, intricate moldings and light fixtures. Even the original plush theatre seats, marquee and ticket booth were preserved. The Riviera is now used for weddings and meetings. The lobby of the hotel features a hand-blown Venetian chandelier set between a Georgian open arm staircase. At 12 feet in diameter and in height, the chandelier is made of more than 3,000 individual pieces of glass, hand blown in Murano, Italy. It weighs approximately two and one-half tons. In 1995, Orient-Express Hotels acquired the hotel and in 2014, the company changed its name to Belmond Ltd. At that time the hotel was renamed Belmond Charleston Place.

His career spans over two decades with bands including the 7 League Boots, Elbow, Jethro and The Benders as well as solo work. Thayer is also the founder of the Tweed River Music Festival. Career =Seven League Boots= Founded in 1990, the Seven League Boots included Bow Thayer, Bobby Sullivan, bassist Richard Feins, and drummer and vocalist Mike Press. The group hailed from Hingham, Massachusetts and formed in Boston. In 1990 and 1991, they pressed multiple singles to 7” vinyl before releasing their first and only LP, 12 Songs, on Constant Change. The group embarked on a tour spanning three years, during which time they shared the stage with bands including Fugazi, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Redd Kross, The Buck Pets, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom, and Beck. They also were known to influence Rage Against the Machine, and Pearl Jam was an opener in its early days. The group disbanded in the mid-1990s but played a reunion show at the Tweed River Music Festival in 2012. =Elbow and Jethro= Following 7 League Boots, Bow formed the band Elbow. Elbow was composed of Bow on guitar, banjo and vocals, bassist and vocalist Jeremy Moses Curtis and drummer Michael Press. The group released 3 records and frequented both the Boston and New York circuits. The band’s sound was characteristic of the minimalist approach of the electric blues overhaul and was based around slide guitar and a trash-can drumset. During the same period of time, Thayer was also a part of Jethro, playing banjo and singing lead vocals. Also in the band were frequent collaborator Jeremy Moses Curtis on acoustic guitar, Danielle Demarse on bass and vocals and Sean Staples on mandolin. The group combined Bow’s pop-structured songs with the aesthetic of bluegrass and was well received. Both groups eventually moved to Vermont. =The Benders= In the early 2000s, Bow would return to the Boston area frequently to play with The Benders. With Bow, guitarist Jabe Beyer, and bassist Nolan McKelvey as the chief songwriters, the group also included Sean Staples on mandolin, and Tim Kelly on dobro. The Benders embodied the classic bluegrass outfit and built a following locally. The Benders were known for their original and unique take on string band music while using a traditional recording style, where the five players arranged in an arc around two microphones and essentially recorded live. The debut self-titled record was released in 2001, followed by The Benders II in 2002, and the studio recording Mountain Radio in 2003. The latter two releases were on Pig Pile Records. =Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck= Following the end of the Bender’s era, Bow Thayer formed his solo project, Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck. The group included Bow on guitar, banjo and lead vocals, James Rohr on piano and organ, Jeff Berlin on drums, Steve Mayone on guitar (later replaced by Chris McGandy on pedal steel) and Jeremy Moses Curtis on bass and vocals. The group recorded three studio albums and one live album. The group’s self-titled debut was released March 1, 2008, at Levon Helm Studios in Woodstock, NY, engineered by Grammy-award winning Justin Guip. Bottom Of The Sky was released November 12, 2010, and was also recorded at Levon Helm Studios and co-produced, engineered and mixed by Justin Guip. In November 2010, the group had the opportunity to play as the backing band for “Imagine There’s No Hunger” at the Hard Rock Café Hollywood, benefiting Why Hunger. Featured performances included Edgar Winter, Dave Stewart, Booker T. Jones and Ringo Starr. In April 2012, Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck won Boston’s Rock’n’Roll Rumble, at TT the Bear’s in Cambridge. Third studio album, Eden was released on March 5, 2013, and was well received both locally and nationally.American Songwriter praised the record, saying “In a different era, Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck would have some well-deserved gold records on their walls.” Prior to the release of Eden, Bow and Perfect Trainwreck performed the record to the sold-out Chandler Music Hall in Randolph, VT on January 19, 2013. On Earth Day, April 22, 2014, Eden: Live at the Chandler was released as the group’s fourth full length and first live album. The album represents both the first live performance of Eden and one of the group’s last performances. =Work with Levon Helm= While recording in Boston in 2005, Bow mentioned offhand the desire to bring a Levon Helm-inspired feel to his current recording. Session engineer/guitar player Dave Rizzuti had just worked with Helm, and introduced the two. They connected instantly upon meeting and in the studio, and began recording together. Bow’s record Spend It All (featuring Levon Helm) was released November 1, 2006, and features the successful single Bow Thayer and Perfect Trainwreck performed at seven of Helm’s Midnight Ramble’s, including the 100th Ramble on July 5, 2008. =Other Solo Work= Other solo recordings by Bow Thayer include The Driftwood Periodicals Vol I released May 1, 2004, and Vol II released October 1, 2008, Maintenance for Mood Swings released September 1, 2006, and Shooting Arrows At The Moon released November 1, 2009. Hindsight, released August 7, 2012, is a compilation of Bow’s work from Elbow, Jethro, The Benders and The Perfect Trainwreck. =The Bojotar Years= In 2014, Bow released a new album of progressive mountain music written and performed entirely using his acoustic and electric Bojotar instruments. Sundowser, featuring guest performances by Marco Benevento and Tracy Bonham, was described by American Song Writer as \\"Think of a jam between Dave Matthews, Frank Zappa and The Band – with a cameo from Bela Fleck – and you almost get the effect: virtuosic complexities from a remarkable instrumentalist.\\" In 2016, with his drummer Jeff Berlin recovering from a series of strokes, Bow released The Source and the Servant, a collection of traditional folk and delta blues songs that were inspired, performed by and/or written by Dock Boggs and Mississippi Fred McDowell. Customized Instruments Bow cites Mark Sandman, lead singer and bass player of Morphine, as a chief inspiration in his creation of customized instruments. Sandman was known for his signature 2 string slide bass. Morphine’s saxophonist, Dana Colley has also played on many of Bow’s solo records. Bow has built a number of customized guitars and banjos. One of his creations combines an acoustic guitar, resonator guitar and banjo. The instrument has a chambered guitar body with a resonator and two pickups - a humbucker by the neck and a Piezo under the resonator's biscuit. The low E string of the guitar has been replaced by the drone string of a banjo at the 5th fret. The Bojotar went into production by Eastwood Guitars in fall 2014. Tweed River Music Festival Bow Thayer is the founder and co-partner with Jeremy Moses Curtis of the Tweed River Music Festival. The festival was held over the course of three days in Bow’s hometown of Stockbridge, VT until its finale, \\"Tweed Gone Mad,\\" that was held on larger grounds along the Mad River in Waitsfield, VT. In addition to Bow, Lydia Loveless, Christopher Paul Stelling, Joe Fletcher, Caitlyn Canty and No Small Children among many others performed. The festival has closed to allow Bow and Jeremy to spend more time on their music and with their families.Tweed River Festival Website Beginning as a gathering of friends for Fourth of July, the festival became a pilgrimage for grass roots music in the Green Mountains of Vermont, with nearly all of the 1,000 attendees camping on-site . In 2011, a “Tweed River Music Festival: A Documentary” was shot and produced by Grey Sky Films and said to be “a snapshot of the greatest weekend you will ever have.\\" It was awarded the Silver Award for Best Documentary at the 2013 Cinerockom International Film Festival in Beverly Hills, CA.

It is the only species in the monophyletic genus Muiria. Description Muiria in dormancy, in papery sheaths after finishing flowering. Unlike most other plants in its family, Muiria is covered in soft downy fur (from which it gets its common name) and has leaves that are entirely fused together, into one smooth rounded body. In the summer it produces white or pink flowers, that tear through the (still living) flesh of the plant. The flesh then withers into a papery sheath, within which the new body forms. After several generations of subdivisions, it can form clumps. Life-cycle Like many related plants, Muirias grow in annual cycles of growth and dormancy. Their habitat is a winter rainfall region. They therefore begin their growth cycle in early autumn when the first rains arrive, pushing out of the dry sheaths which remain from the previous years dead leaves, and forming the new green growth. Throughout the winter, they receive mists and occasional rainfall. By the end of winter, the new growth stops and appears to decay, becoming more yellow and soft in the spring. The flower buds can then push through the softened flesh. With the onset of the full summer drought, flowering ends, the old flesh gradually dries into a papery sheath and the plants enter a brief dormancy (which can last any period between a few weeks and four months). The first new rains bring it out of dormancy and commence the cycle again. Distribution and habitat Muiria is indigenous to a tiny arid area (c.300 mm annual rainfall) of the \\"Succulent Karoo\\" in the Western Cape, South Africa. Its habitat is the quartzite rubble that overlay clay soils on the low ridges near the Langeberg Mountains. In this extremely small range, it has recently suffered an enormous reduction in population and range, due to habitat loss, trampling by stock animals and illegal collecting. Cultivation Muiria hortenseae is difficult to cultivate, as it requires sparing but steady watering throughout most of the year, generous space for its large root system, and a rocky, gritty, extremely well-drained soil. Some cultivators also occasionally add a one or two grains of salt to the soil surface, to add an extremely slight salinity to the soil. It is also recommended to give it little to no water for a drought of a month or two, after it has flowered. Propagation is usually by seed, and Muiria sometimes hybridises with Gibbaeum album, with which it shares its natural habitat in the Little Karoo.

A variation of the game is a popular form of raffle in the UK and elsewhere.  By region  = Italy = A classic Neapolitan tombola In Italy, a tombola is a traditional board game, first played in the city of Naples in the eighteenth century. It is similar to the game of bingo. It is mostly played at Christmas time, and prizes are often only symbolic. = United Kingdom = alt= In the United Kingdom, a tombola is a form of raffle in which prizes are pre-assigned to winning tickets. Typically numbered raffle tickets are used, with prizes allocated to all those ending in a particular digit (traditionally a five or a zero). Players pay for a ticket, which they then draw at random from a hat or tombola drum, and can instantly see whether or not they have won a prize. Tombolas are popular at events such as village fêtes and coffee mornings, when it is expected that not all the players will be present at the end of the event. = United States = In the United States, fair style fundraisers may have booths with prizes that can be won in a manner similar to UK tombola. Players pay to select a folded paper from a container, and unfold it to determine if—and perhaps what—they have won. Typically, winning tickets will be identified by the ending digits of the number on the paper (for instance, –00). Prizes may be distributed by letting the player make a selection or by proactively marking prizes with the winning numbers. = India = In India, the game is often misspelled as Tambola, although Tombola is the official spelling. Tickets are distributed among the players and the presenter announces the numbers in an exciting way. One by one the players claim the prizes and win either real money (which is decided before starting the game) or a gift. Prizes that can be claimed while playing Tombola are: * Early Five: A player can claim early five when he strikes the first five numbers in the ticket. * Four Corners: To claim Four Corners a player should strike Top Row: 1st & 5th Number; Bottom Row: 1st and 5th Number. * Top Line: A player can claim top line when all the numbers on first-line are struck in the ticket. * Middle Line: To claim middle-line a player should have all the middle line numbers struck. * Bottom Line: To claim bottom-line a player should have all the bottom line numbers struck. * Pyramid: Just as its name, Top Row: 3rd Number; Middle Row: 2nd, 4th Number; Bottom Row: 1st, 3rd, 5th Number are struck then a player can claim pyramid. * Center: A player can claim center when the 3rd number of the middle row is being cut. * Circle: Whosoever 3rd number of the Top Row, 2nd, 4th number of the Middle Row, 3rd number of the Bottom row are struck can claim Circle. * Breakfast: Numbers in Column 1, 2 and 3.
